  FOREWORD 
Peruars only a scholar who has struggled with 
the masses of information and misinformation acces- 
sible but not available on every subject can appreciate 
the work of Mrs. Becker in her “ Reader’s Guide.” 
It is somewhat of a feat to be able to give the best 
books in four or five fields, or to list the reading most 
likely to meet common needs. But Mrs. Becker has 
covered well nigh every field of knowledge and imagi- 
nation in her years of service, and has fitted the 
book to the reader so often with gratifying results 
that she may be justly regarded as an institution. 
If it were not that her personality is well known on 
the lecture platform and at literary gatherings, she 
would risk the fate of Andrew Lang who was charged 
with being a syndicate, not a man. Mrs. Becker’s 
clients are editors, writers, women’s clubs, ministers, 
students, lecturers, puzzled readers, and the very 
scholars who make the reference books to which in 
some miraculous fashion she seems to hold always 
a master key. She differs from the retailers of infor- 
mation that have always served the press in columns 
of question and answer, first, in breadth of knowledge, 
next, in accuracy, third and most important in a 
personal touch in criticism and comment which makes 
her guides as suggestive as they are instructive. No 
teacher in any university, no bibliographer or en-

cyclopedist can have helped so many in sudden need 
of knowledge. She is as intellectually curious as 
Chaucer’s clerk of Oxenford, as wise in the ways of 
books as an old publisher, and as well informed as a 
university professor and a librarian rolled into one. 
For many years in The Literary Review of The New 
York: Evening Post, and now in the new Saturday 
Review of Literature, I have had the pleasure of pub- 
lishing her column, the riches of which go to make 
this book. She has been a welcome aid to a harassed 
editor when questions came in which he could not 
answer; and a constant source of satisfaction as one 
saw the sources of good and well directed reading 
rising weekly in her Guide. This book guarantees 
a permanence for her labors that a magazine cannot 
give, and the curious, and all distressed by questions, 
and all needy of information, and every good reader 
seeking new books or old books, but most of all the 
right books, will welcome it. Lux et Veritas should 
be its motto.

§r 
“FOUR BOOKS A YEAR” 
  Wuen I returned from a month in the West in the 
autumn of 1921, I found on the top of a mountain 
of mail a letter endorsed by the relative who had 
been keeping correspondents at bay, “Answer this 
first. You'll see why.” It was on a single card, 
packed in with the skill that comes in only one 
way —literary tastes early in life combined with 
a paper shortage. To this paper-famine, which was 
in my day the regular state of things for literary- 
minded children, I owe the fact that I am making 
the first draft of this book on the blank pages of 
my social correspondence. 
The address, too, was a bond of sympathy, for it 
was on a rural free delivery route. I remember 
when there were none of these, and I have lived to 
see a second-hand Ford come climbing the hill to the 
door of a farmhouse that I knew when it was isolated, 
bringing all the world to the door with yesterday’s 
newspaper. I watched it wheezing up the valley one 
calm August morning with not a notion that it was 
carrying the World War. So I can’t even yet take 
the letters R.F.D. just as letters; they have too 
much meaning. 
   
-P-A-G-E-14
  A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
It was from a woman on a farm in Pennsylvania, 
a “ back-to-the-lander ” whose budget allowed her to 
buy but four new books a year, she explained. I 
remembered the farm bookshelves I’ve seen and the 
proportion of new books on them, and pricked up 
my ears. She said she did not often make a mistake, 
but she had just picked the wrong book and had in 
consequence somewhat lost her nerve, and had decided 
to ask me, encouraged by my expressed opinion that 
Arnold Bennett would outlast any English fiction- 
writer of his period, and by my devotion to the 
novels of Sheila Kaye-Smith, with other signs of 
kindred tastes. “May I ask you to tell me,” said 
she, “of a few books that you have loved, that have 
made you sit up and just shout with delight? I am 
going to buy four new books this winter and I want 
four friends to stay by me, to read over and over.” 
She added that the nearest library was far, and that 
the horses were always needed when she wanted to 
go to town, by which I knew that she was a bona 
fide farmer’s wife. 
But it was when she began to give me samples to 
order from that I realized what books must mean to 
her on the farm. “Of course I’ve read Kipling and 
Stevenson, also I enjoyed ‘If Winter Comes’ (this 
was long before the boom started), Frederick Niven’s 
‘A Tale That is Told,’ and Conal O’Riordan’s ‘Adam 
of Dublin’—oh, that was like good wine to me, 
it adds a year to my life every time I read it. Tell 
me of one its equal and I shall always be yours 
gratefully.” Wells, she admitted, wasn’t her kind, 
nor Conrad; in Hardy she delighted, and in Irish
-P-A-G-E-15
  
SWEEPING THE FIELD 5 
poetry and Irish literature generally, from Colum to 
Somerville and Ross. Was “Main Street” just a 
curiosity, or would that be one of the books to com- 
panion her through the winter? Altogether the letter 
came up out of the card like the genie out of the 
bottle. 
Now I would not have been a human being had I 
not packed up four books and sent them off with a 
note saying that I had too many and she too few 
and that before we could talk business we’d have to 
make some effort to restore the balance of nature. 
They were, as I explained, a somewhat haphazard 
choice because all booklovers should have a little 
margin and she was running too close to the edge, 
but it so chanced that every one fitted in to some 
particular place. For instance, I’d sent her “ Dodo 
Wonders,” and on her shelf along with “ Trilby ” and 
“The Heavenly Twins” which she had been reading 
when the package came, there was a worn copy of 
“Dodo.” “My daughter scorns it,” said she. “ Isn’t 
that a dreadful commentary on my taste?” Louis 
Untermeyer’s “ Modern American Poetry ” she began 
to read aloud at once to her grandchildren, five and 
eight, and “ Cape Currey ” by Réné Juta was taking 
the whole family on a long voyage to Africa and old 
time. So I printed part of her letter and turned the 
choice of the four books over to the readers of the 
Gute, saying that perhaps now some people would 
see that I did not have to work up interest in a mail 
that might at any minute, and generally did, hold 
a letter as alive as this. The only suggestion I 
offered was that under the conditions I thought my 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  6 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
old rule in the Sunday-school library would apply, 
which was, as between a thin one and a fat one 
always take the fat one. 
But what I did not print was that my letter had 
reached her the day she came home after a major 
operation. In twenty minutes from the time she 
knew she was not a normal healthy woman she was 
on her way to the hospital; she had had just time to 
catch up Padraic Colum’s “ Wild Earth” and toss it 
into her suitcase. The cost of all this would settle new 
books for at least a year —“ Rural New Vorker and 
the Literary Review are all we can buy ” —and that 
meant something to what she called “a whining 
convalescent.” 
How little she whined one may infer from the 
fact that it was only from her devoted daughter that 
I learned what they both knew and what I never 
told the readers of the Guime—that the malady 
was only checked, and that, in a few months at 
most, agony and death were waiting. All.she said 
about that was how much it meant “to have four 
books all at once to pass the hours when I must 
lie still.” 
At once letters began to pour in. Everyone took 
the choice of those four books to heart in the proper 
way. “I should be miserable,” said one,” if through 
me that woman bought a book and then hated it.” 
The first letter that came told her by all means to 
take a chance on “ Main Street,” for whatever it 
was it would stay that way for some time, and to 
get for the others “ Queen Victoria,” the one-volume 
“Outline of History,” both just from the press, and
-P-A-G-E-17
  SWEEPING THE FIELD 7 
one that would never be read to death, “The Way 
of All Flesh.” Another wrote, from the isolation of 
a mountain farm with grades so steep the ploughing 
had to be done by oxen in Biblical fashion, that she 
had for a piece de résistance year after year “a big, 
fascinating, meandering volume, ‘Memorials of a 
Quiet Life,’ by Augustus J. C. Hare, a tribute to his 
mother, and I never grow weary of living in the 
home circle of this charming, cultured, earnest English 
gentlewoman.” By the way, two years have passed 
since that letter was printed and I am still sending 
the addresses of British and American secondhand 
booksellers who keep this book in stock, to people 
who send in clippings of this correspondence and ask 
where they may get it. I had one from Africa. 
Another advised for the first three books “ Growth 
of the Soil,” “ The Education of Henry Adams,” and 
“The Story of Mankind,” and for the fourth a choice 
of “ The World’s Illusion,” George Moore’s “ Abelard 
and Heloise,’ or the “ Reminiscences of Raphael 
Pumpelly,” according to the degree of R.F.D.’s 
toughmindedness. “TI realize,’ he added, “that this 
is not for a limited budget, or for one who must 
at all costs be up to date.” People soon understood 
that what this reader needed was not newness nor 
oldness in itself, but that quality that makes a little 
boy in Alabama—another client of the GurpE— 
call his best books “caramels”; a sort of chewiness 
and steady flavor. How I wish she could have had 
Frank Swinnerton’s “ Young Felix”! Walpole’s “ The 
Young Enchanted” was recommended by a reader 
who bracketed with it Untermeyer’s “ Modern Brit-
-P-A-G-E-18
  8 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
ish Poetry” and Henry Kingsley’s old romance, 
“ Ravenshoe.” If I had not said she had “ Trilby ” 
dozens would have named it; as it was “ The Cloister 
and the Hearth” came in again and again, and so 
did Borrow. “Elizabeth” was I think the author 
most often advised, and “ Growth of the Soil” the 
single book most often recommended. “Vera” and 
“Tn the Mountains” were new then, but readers 
advised everything from “The Pastor’s Wife” on, 
and an old man on a lonely farm in the West wrote 
me a charming letter in a shaky but scholarly hand, 
saying that he was reading the “German Garden” 
for the third time. 
“Quiet Interior,” by E. B. C. Jones, was another 
recommendation that helped others besides R.F.D. 
I have been getting letters constantly since from 
people who thank for me for that introduction to a 
writer of such curious and distinctive charm. I 
wish R.F.D. could have read “The Wedgwood 
Medallion,’ and how she would have delighted in 
Elizabeth’s “The Enchanted April”! “The Wild 
Swans at Coole,” “The Crock of Gold,” (the en- 
chanting “ Deirdre” of James Stephens was not out 
yet), Alice Meynell’s essays, “The Wind in the 
Willows,” were suggested, and the little study of 
Louise Imogen Guiney by Alice Brown, from one 
who said “ there’s pure delight in that.” “I would 
put ‘Invisible Tides’ at the top of the list,” said 
one, “as the one book of the year not to be missed,” 
and some people who had not heard of Beatrice 
Seymour before that, watched happily for “The 
Hopeful Journey” to come out this fall, in conse-
-P-A-G-E-19
  
SWEEPING THE FIELD 9 
quence. People often take more stock in that sort 
_ of recommendation than in a regular review. “ Frivo- 
lous as it may sound,” said one, “ I’d put in ‘ Danger- 
ous Ages’ for its study of the two old women, and 
for its flings at psycho-analysis, so deftly done.” The 
only thing frivolous about that book was the red 
lantern on the jacket; it made you laugh but it made 
you think. “Tell her about Morley’s collection of 
‘Modern Essays,’ ” said one, “if only for the one on 
winter by Marion Storm and the perfect tribute to 
his daughter by William Allen White. But every- 
_ thing in it is worth re-reading; I had my choice of 
any one in the bookshop as a gift, and because I 
wanted a book to keep by me I chose that.” 
“Td bracket Hudson’s ‘Green Mansions,’” said a 
letter, ‘with James Stephens’s ‘ Mary, Mary’ as the 
books one just can’t live without.” Several spoke up 
for biographies as permanent investments: “The 
Mendelssohn Family ” was one old one I remember, 
and E. F. Benson’s “Our Family Affairs” one new 
one. I can just imagine how R.F.D. would have gone 
through “ William De Morgan and his Wife” like a 
forest fire. When that great package of delight came 
from the press and I started in on it I kept feeling 
as if I were reading for two. 
As it was, her letters were delightful enough. She 
herself could not see why. 
“No, I see nothing in my letter to you that would 
‘win the hearts,’ as you say, of these people who 
have given thought to me. But I do know the intense 
sympathy of a certain type of reader for another of 
the same class. I once knew and heartily disliked the

  10 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
husband of a neighbor of ours. He was a book-keeper 
on $18 a week with six children and paying for his 
home. Yet he was the only person outside my own 
family circle that I knew at that time who could dis- 
cuss books in the way — well, you know how. He had 
a few pine shelves put up by himself in a corner of 
the living room, and they were being slowly filled with 
paper editions, second hand mostly, of his beloved 
writers. I hated him for his way with his children, — 
but when we sat down in that corner and talked books, 
he was my blood brother— or ink brother should I 
say?—and I shared with him for very pity of his 
hunger. I think that man would have been better in 
all ways could he have had a few book-buying orgies, 
but it was grinding poverty until the end. And so I 
can understand the kind of people who know what it 
is to long for a new book, or one pertaining to a life- 
long interest, and their delight in finding one to share 
it with.” : 
Other ink-relatives were to join her family. It soon 
became necessary to suspend for the only time in the 
Gurpe’s history the rule that no correspondent shall 
be told the name of another, and to ask R.F.D. if I 
could give her address to the people who wanted to 
write or send books, or back numbers of the Aélantic 
or Asia, which I notice were the magazines most fre- 
quently offered, as having a high vitamine content. 
One whose name anyone familiar with the Social 
Register would recognize sent me a check to cover 
the cost of the four books on which the final choice 
should fall, keeping the name of the donor a secret. 
So I could begin with “ Queen Victoria,” and I can

  SWEEPING THE FIELD il 
tell you it means something when you have been 
budgeting as strictly as that, to have a five-dollar book 
drop on you when you had no hope of it —and of 
course could not know that there would be a cheaper 
edition later on. 
The second book was “ Maria Chapdelaine.” She 
wrote after that, “I took nearly a week to read it. 
I hated to finish it. It seemed to leave us under a 
sort of spell; we did not want to take up anything less 
beautiful.” The third was “The Story of Dr. Do- 
little” because I knew she would like it as much as 
the grandchildren she would read it aloud to. The 
fourth was easy, for she wanted one as good as Conal 
O’Riordan’s “ Adam of Dublin” and did not know 
that in the meantime the second volume of that de- 
licious racy novel had appeared, “ Adam and Caroline.” 
Speaking of anthologies she wrote, “I believe Pad- 
raic Colum’s new one of Irish poetry will be the best 
buy. How I love that slim little book ‘Wild Earth!’ 
I love it. It gets right into my heart. Over and over 
I read its singing lines.” The prospect of book-friends 
overjoyed her. “If when I am filled with enthusiasm 
over a book, I could write to another lover of it and 
know he would enjoy discussing it! Hereabouts no 
one even wants to borrow my books.” 
“ Tf you only knew how shameless I am where books 
are concerned you would not need to be so tactful — 
making me feel I merit all this because I cannot con- 
trol my desire for the exquisite pleasure of reading. 
I suspect you of a good deal in this. Why should you 
care so much? Have you known book-hunger and 
loneliness? I never cared for theatre, dancing or

society as most women do, With books I slip out of 
my life and am with the choicest company. I am 
grateful to the ones who have reached out their hands 
to me, but I do not know how to say it so it will 
sound right. I must wonder if I am awake and really 
hearing from people who care for books as I do. And 
now that I am in pain it seems as if they had come in 
my greatest need.” 
That was all she said that hinted of what was so 
soon to come, all save this: “ At best I have only a 
short time to read — J know — and I do want to hang 
on until Arnold Bennett’s ‘Mr. Prohack’ comes out, 
and perhaps that will give me another lease on 
life, eh? You love him too. I can always re-read 
‘Clayhanger.’” 
Now “Mr. Prohack” was nowhere near publica- 
tion, but within five minutes I had his publishers on 
the telephone and within two hours the first copy any- 
one saw in America, even the reviewers, was on its 
way to R.F.D. She began to read it by herself and 
then the daughter whose tenderness enfolded her took 
up the reading. In the intervals of her consciousness 
it was finished, and with the last words a blessed haze 
of opiates rose around her bright spirit. “ Mr. Pro- 
hack ” helped her away out of pain. 
In life I never met Mrs. Katherine Hilliard Young. 
But if ever I go to Heaven I know where to find her. 
T shall go straight over to the corner by the bookcases.

INSTEAD OF COLLEGE. I. 
“T wonder if you could make up a list of books for 
me that would give me something of a background 
equivalent to a college education? I am entering 
law school in the fall, and I would like to be on a 
more equal footing with the college men.” 
I cout, of course, dispose of this question by saying 
truthfully that there are no such books. But it would 
not be fair. Here is a young man who is to meet a 
certain situation and asks, in effect, if there are books 
that will help him meet it; and in a way, and to a 
degree, there are. For instance, there is “ College and 
the Future,” by Richard Rice, Jr. (Scribner), a col- 
lection of essays and addresses by famous educators — 
among them William James, Woodrow Wilson and 
Alexander Meiklejohn — setting forth with temperance 
and lucidity and from the inside, what a college educa- 
tion can and cannot do. If you read this through 
carefully, you will see that, in what a college does for 
its students, books bear a subsidiary part. It is not 
so much what they are as what is done with them. 
Not a few educators believe that it is even more impor- 
tant, what the student learns to do without them. 
From the mass of presidential addresses and other 
such expressions of opinion one comes to the conclu- 
sion that if we are to believe what they say about the 
American college, it exists primarily to train men and 
women for leadership. In rare cases, to train men and 
women to be actual leaders; in the main, to prepare 
   
-P-A-G-E-24
  14 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
the rank and file of college graduates to provide the 
intelligent and discriminating support upon which the 
leader must depend to make his leadership effective. 
This holds good whether the college in question be- 
lieves that the world is best served by what is called 
a progressive leader, or by what some call sound and 
others stand-pat leadership: 
If, then, this is really what the college is intended to 
do, it does it in two ways — by training the student 
in the habit of individual thinking, and by providing 
him with material for thought. You will see that cer- 
tain books may do this outside of the college; some- 
times they are text-books, sometimes they are prepared 
without this use in mind. “The Legacy of Greece” 
(Oxford University Press) and the corresponding 
volume that has recently followed it, “The Legacy 
of Rome” (Oxford University Press), with the review 
of Greek thought and literature by R. W. Livingstone, 
“The Pageant of Greece” (Oxford University Press), 
are intended for those who know no Greek or 
Latin, but are cherished also by those who do. 
“Greek Life and Thought,” by La Rue Van Hook 
(Columbia University Press), is another book that 
catches the reader in the current of its enthusiasm 
and fills him with its inspiration. If reading 
such a book arouses in you a generous interest 
in its subject, use its book-lists —such books always 
have them—for further study. One book leads 
to another, the right book makes you hungry 
for more, and if there are too many heaped at any 
one point, the ReapEr’s Gutpe is one of the agencies 
existing to give advice on which one to read first. To

read like that is one of the high delights of being a 
human being, and like all high delights, there must be 
a certain noble recklessness about it, something quite 
different from “ calculating profits, so much help from 
so much reading.” 
All these surveys that are coming out, if not pre- 
pared on purpose for readers in search of a “ college 
equivalent,” have their needs in mind. The “ Outline 
of History ” (Macmillan) had; so had the excellent 
“ Outline of Science” (Putnam) ; so evidently has the 
“Outline of Literature” that Mr. Drinkwater is 
editing (Putnam). If this does not inspire in me the 
- excited determination to read everything else in the 
world on the subject, that Mr. Wells’s “ Outline ” in- 
spired, I have found that it has helped others to cor- 
relate a large and desultory reading, or to give a sense 
of background to readers whose books are all of 
to-day. 
Whatever the surveys do, they do not and cannot 
provide learning. Colleges do not do that. “No 
one,” says President Wilson in Professor Rice’s book, 
“has ever dreamed of imparting learning in four years. 
To become a man of learning is the enterprise of a 
lifetime.” Percy Lubbock in his delicious volume of 
“Roman Pictures” (Scribner) tells of a young man 
whose acquaintance with the latest movements in 
literature and art astounded the bystanders, “ but the 
gulf of vacuity that yawned beneath his culture was 
a shock.” Culture, learning, education itself, involve 
not only what you get but also the process of get- 
ting it. The Creator Himself, my father used to re- 
mind me, could not make a four-months-old calf in a

minute. He used also to say that He was too wise to 
want to. 
As might have been expected, this reply brought in 
not a few rejoinders, of which the most cogent was a 
letter that, while agreeing in the main, went on to 
say: 
§3 
INSTEAD OF COLLEGE. IL. 
“ A college education is mainly a course of lectures, 
books seldom being absolutely necessary, or playing 
a secondary part, but text-books may be had for any 
subject of a college course, and we think that is what 
many persons want to know.” 
InveEep I know that is what they want to know. 
But I cannot be a party to the self-deception involved 
in reading a college text-book and thinking you have 
had what the college student has had. The usual text- 
book is adapted not only to a particular subject and 
audience, but to a special type of treatment, in some 
instances one might almost say to a particular place. 
If I may be permitted a homely comparison, reading 
a “standard college text” at home is like eating a 
dry prune. The food value is the same, but it calls 
for the dogged chewing that only a very hungry man 
can keep up. It needs to be soaked in the academic 
atmosphere, cooked by research and _ discussion, 
seasoned — but you can go on with the metaphor 
by yourself. 
What sort of books, then, will give the outsider the
-P-A-G-E-27
  SWEEPING THE FIELD 17 
college type of mental training? Not the “surveys.” 
I am glad to own, to read and to recommend them, 
but not for this particular purpose. Of necessity they 
must deal in general views and general statements, 
and in time generalities and nothing but generalities 
is bound to flatten out the mind. Nothing gives a 
man keener insight into civilization in general or, in 
time, a better all-round education, than a lively inter- 
est in some specialist’s study of his specialty which 
is in effect a survey of civilization from his own view- 
point. A series of such lively interests seems to me 
to make the best return that a course of reading can 
make for mental enrichment. 
To come at once to definite illustrations, I know 
of no book from which a man who is only well-read, 
or who is not even that, has a better chance of be- 
coming educated than from L. T. Hobhouse’s “ Morals 
in Evolution” (Holt). Read this and think as you go 
and I believe it is not too much to say that all your 
subsequent reading will have a tremendously in- 
creased value. The student will find in the same 
author’s “ The Rational Good ” and “ The Elements of 
Social Justice” (Holt) further development along 
these lines. Take for another starting-point Rear Ad- 
miral Bradley Fiske’s “ Invention: the Master-Key to 
Progress” (Dutton), an inventor’s study of the part 
taken by the inventor’s spirit in the life of the world, 
its material achievements and its spiritual develop- 
ment. Follow this with “Makers of Science,” by 
Ivor B. Hart (Oxford University Press), a history 
of man’s effort in mathematics, physics and astron- 
omy, from the Greeks to Einstein, a book slender  
-P-A-G-E-28

enough for a coat pocket and with type clear enough 
for railway reading. 
Start again. Read D. B. Updike’s “ Printing Types: 
their History, Forms and Use, a Study in Survivals ” 
(Harvard University Press), which is not only the 
most comprehensive and enlightening book on its 
subject, but for this present purpose valuable be- 
cause it amounts to a printer’s history of civiliza- _ 
tion since the invention of printing, a study of how 
the characteristics of each generation get into the 
printed page and how the good things last. 
Once more. Sir William Osler’s “ Evolution of 
Modern Medicine” (Yale University Press) is for 
medical students but open to the public, for Dr. 
Osler was “the great liaison officer of the medical 
profession.” Roy L. Moodie’s “ Antiquity of Dis- 
ease” (University of Chicago Press) is a history of 
man’s first diseases, of primitive surgery and of the 
diseases that have disappeared. These would not 
only induce a more reasonable frame of mind to 
the doctor, but afford one more aspect of that con- 
tinuity of human effort that makes civilization and 
is called progress. 
One who, like Mr. Wells, “contemplates the law 
and lawyers of to-day with a temperamental lack of 
appreciation” really ought to do something for it. 
Let him read Sir Henry Maine’s “Ancient Law” 
(Dutton), and Roscoe Pound’s “Introduction to 
the Philosophy of Law” (Yale) or his yet more 
recent “Interpretation of Legal History,” lectures 
delivered at Cambridge University, published by the 
Cambridge University Press in 1923. 
 
-P-A-G-E-29

I do not know of any course of reading from which 
a man could get more education that he could put 
to direct use at the present time, or that would have 
a better effect on his mind and character, than by 
beginning with “ Evolution and Christian Faith” by 
Prof. H. H. Lane (Princeton University Press) and 
going on —as this book inspires one to go on — with 
the books it suggests for further reading. I choose 
this book as a beginning because by the time one 
has completed it the spirit of sweet reasonableness 
with which it is pervaded will have crept, into the 
soul of the reader, and the rest of the course under- 
taken with malice toward none. “The Origin and 
Evolution of Religion,’ by E. Washburn Hopkins 
(Yale University Press) is another book for the 
inquiring mind, and for every step along this way 
there are books listed in the little manual, “ Living 
Religions,” by Dr. Robert E, Hume (Scribner). 
I find Viscount Bryce’s “Modern Democracies ” 
(Macmillan) the most lucid exposition of its subject 
in the English language, and I have known a college 
boy and his grandmother to read it aloud together 
with the same relish, but before I read it I would 
read “ Progress and History,” a symposium edited by 
F. S. Marvin, and his “ Century of Hope” (Oxford 
University Press). The Department of History of 
the University of Chicago publishes a “Study 
Manual for European History” divided into weeks 
of class work, with prescribed and collateral read- 
ing, by which a determined student working at home 
could come as near to a college course on this sub- 
ject as home study could bring him. If he is led

thereby to a study of men’s dreams of perfectibility 
in government, there are Lewis Mumford’s “ The 
Story of Utopias” (Boni and Liveright) and “The 
History of Utopian Thought,” by Joyce Hertzler 
(Macmillan), that came out at about the same time 
and cover much the same ground. 
If there is a field in which it is important to em- 
phasize that there is all the difference in the world 
between knowing something and knowing something 
about it, it is the field of the natural sciences. Yet 
it is just here that the latest and most valuable ad- 
ditions are being made to the equipment of the home 
student through “general reading.” No one expects 
to become a chemist by reading E. E. Slosson’s 
“Creative Chemistry ” (Century Co.), but no book 
has done more to bridge the gap between what chemists 
are doing and what even the intelligent public 
knows about it. Any housewife knows that you can 
move the heaviest furniture if it has light-running cast- 
ers; Dr. Slosson’s tremendous knowledge can be put 
where it is needed to do good, because he slips his ball- 
bearing humor under it. The success of this book 
with the public showed how great is the demand for 
the right kind of “popular science ” — again, not to 
train scientists, but to provide them with an intelli- 
gent audience — and a new kind of book is coming 
into being to meet this demand. ‘“ The Development 
of the Sciences” comes from the Yale University 
Press, lectures by world-famous authorities on mathe- 
matics, physics, chemistry, astronomy, geology, and 
biology, edited by L. L. Woodruff, and in “Science 
Remaking the World ” (Doubleday), a symposium of 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
  SWEEPING THE FIELD 21 
sixteen leading specialists in which they explain their 
fields to the layman. “The Humanizing of Knowl- 
edge,’ by James Harvey Robinson (Doran), is one 
of the signs of the times, and I hope it will be as 
popular as its predecessor, ‘The Mind in the Mak- 
ing” (Harper). 
_ The home student will of course be apt to begin 
these dashes on the impulse of personal preference, 
but it is not always wise to keep strictly within these 
preferences. For instance, a man whose education 
has been along regular academic lines, whose prefer- 
ences are all for literature or art, and who has what 
he believes to be an unconquerable aversion for any- 
thing involving mathematics, might change his atti- 
tude to that subject on reading George Abram Miller’s 
“ Historical Introduction to Mathematical Litera- 
ture” (Macmillan) on the development of mathe- 
matical science and the books in which this is re- 
corded, with life-sketches of great mathematicians. 
Or better yet, if he has the interest in philosophy 
that almost men of this type do have, let him read 
Bertrand Russell’s “Introduction to Mathematical 
Philosophy ” (Macmillan) which sets forth something 
of what has been done by those philosophers —in- 
cluding Mr. Russell himself — who build on “the 
logical foundation of the principles of mathematics.” 
(And speaking of Mr. Russell, I am informed by 
one who is an authority both on poetry and its 
criticism and on philosophical literature, that his new 
book “ The A B C of Atoms” is exciting to the point 
of exhilaration.) I have not taken this medicine my- 
self, but it sounds like good medicine. The reader
-P-A-G-E-32

will not thereby become a mathematician or find in 
these works anything to help him figure his income 
tax, but he will not have for a vast and marvellous 
region of thought the sick aversion felt by so many 
who know it only in its irritating personal aspects. 
This is the way I have been reading all my life. I 
am not at all sure that I am an educated person, but 
I have had a tremendously good time. Also I know 
that no one has ever been able to bore me by talking 
about his specialty. Shop talk is fascinating to any- 
one who knows the shop, even if all he knows is from 
a good look through the door some kind shopman 
has held open, and many a specialist has shown me 
around his place in my time of reading. If I have 
given anyone the impression that I include all college 
text-books in the somewhat disrespectful comparison 
with which this reply began, let him notice how many 
of the books I have named were written by college 
professors and issued by university presses. The 
general reader scarce realizes how many of the stand- 
ard works that have become part of his content in 
consciousness were originally prepared for use in 
colleges. 
I have indicated one way—an amateur’s way — 
of absorbing an education; I have not so much as 
tried to indicate all the subjects that might be treated 
after this manner, for the value of such a list as this 
is in what it starts one doing for one’s self. To pro- 
vide quite another way Columbia University has de- 
veloped and is still developing its efficient “Home 
Study Courses.” And now comes the Haldeman 
Julius Pocket Series in which, according to its own

announcement “ Biography, history, philosophy, sci- 
ence, all are being re-written with an eye to brevity,” 
so that the worker “can learn the gist of the Chinese 
philosophy of life during the noon hour; can obtain 
a clear view of the sweep of evolution on his way 
home from work”: so that on Sundays in the inter- 
vals of feeding peanuts to the monkeys “he can read 
about the upward march of the race from monkey to 
man [sic].” I hope Mr. Haldeman Julius will get to 
work at once on a vest-pocket edition of the New 
York Telephone Directory that will be just as effec- 
tive as the one we have now. Such a work is just as 
much needed, and just as easy to make, as a five- 
minute equivalent of “ The Origin of Species.” 
§4 
“SAVOIR FAIRE” 
“Will you kindly advise me if it is possible to acquire 
a worldly polish—an air of savoir faire — from a 
course of reading? I have read quite extensively, 
outside the reading required for college entrance, 
never anything trashy, but I have been restricted 
in my actual experience with the outside world. 
Time and again I have been mortified when other 
young women, who acknowledge that I have much 
more book knowledge, totally eclipse my efforts. 
Moreover, I have heard that those of the demi- 
monde invariably have easy, gracious manners, and 
are often fascinating conversationalists. How is 
this? A friend of mine says it is only a veneer 
they acquire from associating with various men, 
   
-P-A-G-E-34
    24 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
some of brilliant minds, and seeing the world. 
However, I envy them, even if it is only a veneer. 
“I had the misfortune from my twelfth to my nine- 
teenth year to live with a domineering aunt, who 
every time I uttered an opinion criticized, sneered 
and held me up to ridicule. My other relatives 
say she took every bit of self-confidence out of me.” 
In general society and for conversational purposes, 
learning for a woman may be compared to liquor for 
a man — what counts is not how much you have taken 
in, but how well you can carry it. At a time when 
conversation was in flower in France some wise woman 
—I don’t know her name —said, “ Quand on veut 
plaire dans le monde, il faut se resoudre a se laisser 
apprendre beaucoup de choses qu’on sait par des gens 
qui les ignorent,” which in our ruder speech signifies 
that to be a social success you must be willing to be ~ 
taught many things you know all about by people 
who know nothing whatever about them. With this 
precept for a balancing pole, you can get a fairly 
heavy education across the tightrope of general so- 
ciety, otherwise over you go. A liberal education has 
its own charms and uses and no woman, should be 
without one, but so far as talking with strangers goes, 
its chief advantage is that it enables you to ask in- 
telligent questions. 
I would tell you, of course, that yours is a case for 
psycho-analysis, had you not already so neatly per- 
formed that feat for yourself. Given, then, an in- 
feriority complex inhibiting ease in conversation, what 
to do? I have but one rule, but it always works.  
-P-A-G-E-35
  SWEEPING THE FIELD 25 
Cultivate a genuine interest in other people’s con- 
versation. Draw them out, put them through their 
paces, keep them going; you’d be surprised how in- 
teresting they are. In the last three months six 
people have told me that yarn about the ideal short 
story, and I can hardly wait to hear what the seventh 
version will be. It does no good at all to set your 
face to register interest and then back of it go on 
worrying what they think of you. You'll have to be 
interested in what they are telling you. It is not 
necessary, indeed it is not always advisable, to be 
interested in who’s telling it. 
Vast numbers of young people distrust themselves 
as talkers. This is shown by the widespread use of 
what is known as a “ line” — that is, a collection of 
ready-made openings and replies. These collections 
sometimes reach a considerable size, and like the 
button-strings of an earlier period (which they re- 
semble in many respects) are gathered from many 
sources and kept up by exchange. But the “line” 
actually used does not vary: it is cast into the con- 
versation and if it hooks, well and good; if not, it was 
fisherman’s luck. Thus the sportsman’s spirit comes 
to the rescue of personal feeling; the interest is always 
in the next cast. 
“Lines” vary from the frankly inane to the pic- 
turesque and even the sparkling — for examples of 
the latter consult the works of Scott Fitzgerald and 
Dorothy Speare. For acquiring ease in the delivery 
of a “line,” “Dodo” is still valuable. Mr. Benson’s 
heroine of the nineties could not “ get away with her 
line” for five minutes nowadays, but she is still a 
   
-P-A-G-E-36
  26 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
model for the art of opening your mouth and letting 
out whatever language you find just back of your 
front teeth — and that is what the timid need. Dodo 
never kept track of what she said. You have no 
doubt worried a great deal over what you said at a 
party; did you ever lose sleep over another’s break? 
Well, other persons don’t over yours. 
For limbering up conversation it is better to read 
plays than novels, contemporary drawing-room plays: 
Barrie, Somerset Maugham, H. H. Davies, St. John 
Hankin, the happy trifle “ Mary, Mary, Quite Con- 
trary” by St. John Ervine — only for heaven’s sake 
not Bernard Shaw. If anyone should really talk like 
Shaw he would clear a drawing-room in ten minutes. 
Coué ought to help untie these psychic knots. The 
book I like best of those about features of his system 
is Gertrude Mayo’s “ Coué for Children ” (Dodd), be- 
cause even one beyond childhood can find in it some- 
thing to repair some of the damage done by domineer- 
ing aunts and other stranglers. 
As for the conversational powers of the demi-monde, 
I should think they would be conditioned largely by 
those of the monde of which they are the demi. In 
New York City — well, if any fair young girl who 
aspires to enter the demi-monde asks advice of the 
Reaper’s Guive I shall tell her that to qualify as a 
dinner companion for a tired business man in this 
city, ability to discuss “The Waste Land” would be 
a liability rather than an asset.

MUSIC, ART, ARCHITECTURE 
A sophomore says that he has no knowledge at all 
of what has been done in music, art and architec- 
ture, and wants some books that would give him 
“not in a technical way, for I wouldn’t under- 
stand them,’ an idea of the history of music to 
the present time, books that give briefly the lives 
and works of great musicians, and the same sort 
of book with regard to art. For architecture he 
looks for a book that will enable him to recognize 
the various types. He adds, “I have no desire for 
technical knowledge; I do not want to be abso- 
lutely ignorant when these things are being dis- 
cussed.” 
I KNow pretty well what books he wants. I am 
not so sure they are what he needs. 
Harriet Brower’s “Story Lives of Master Musi- 
cians”? (Stokes) tells about the life and works of 
twenty-two great composers from Palestrina to De- 
bussy. There are two volumes of Charles Isaacson’s 
“Face to Face with Great Musicians” (Appleton) 
emotionally written and immensely popular. G. P. 
Upton’s “ Standard Musical Biographies ” (McClurg) 
and R. A. Streatfield’s “ Stories of Great Composers ” 
(Presser) have been widely read for years. ‘“ Master 
Musicians,” by Cuthbert Hadden (Le Roy Phillips), 
has fewer subjects but they are very well presented. 
You will have no trouble in getting these in or through 
any large music store.
-P-A-G-E-38
  28 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
But it is a question in my mind whether the bio- 
graphical approach really gets one very far on the 
road to musical appreciation. If you are taking ever 
so small a part in making music, if you feel yourself 
a musician, you may and probably will get inspiration 
from the lives of other musicians. Above all, you will 
get company, for those inevitable hours when you are 
convinced that you are the only musical creature in 
a Beeotian society. Music teachers have what amounts 
to a superstition that children who do not like to 
practice can be stimulated to do so by reading the 
lives of composers or virtuosi. I doubt it. A lazy 
little girl can imitate Adelina Patti more easily by 
practicing bows before a mirror than by running 
scales. As for the outsider, the less he knows about 
the lives of musicians the more respect he will have 
for the art of music. Who was ever satisfied with a 
musician’s portrait after he had made his acquaint- 
ance through the ears? Musical biographies should 
have none. The composer has won free of those fet~ 
ters, he has come out from behind his face, untangled 
himself from his irrelevant life. He is alive in air. 
I can find out more about Tschaikowski from the 
Adagio Lamentoso of the “ Pathetic” on a tired old 
phonograph than from a week’s worrying whether he 
died of cholera or unrequited love. Why clutter up 
the man’s real life with anything so irrelevant as his 
conduct ? 
So while you will undoubtedly get much that is 
worth reading from the books that I have named, 
don’t stop with them, for you have not yet the story 
of music. You will have a far better chance of getting

it from Paul Landormy’s “ History of Music ” (Scrib- 
ner), recently translated from the French with a sup- 
plementary chapter on American music by Frederick 
H. Martens. This seems to me the most satisfactory 
short history of music for an amateur; it has brought 
a tremendously long and difficult record to the com- 
pass of a single small volume, gracefully written and 
putting the stress on just the points in which the 
present-day listener is most interested. To take 
widely differing examples, the chapters on Wagner 
and on Debussy will have the respect of musicians 
and hold the attention of the unlearned. The Oxford 
Press is bringing out Percy Scholes’s “ Listener’s 
History of Music,” whose first volume goes to Bee- 
thoven. Read W. H. Henderson’s “ How Music De- 
veloped ” (Stokes): read one of the guides to musical 
appreciation, of which the pioneer was Krehbiel’s 
“ How to Listen to Music” (Scribner). An excellent 
guide for a beginner who plays no instrument, and 
the best book I know for one living at a distance 
from concert-rooms and opera-houses, is Dorothy 
Tremble Moyer’s “ Introduction to Music Apprecia- 
tion and History ” (Ditson), for it includes lists of 
records for illustration. Times have changed since 
the early days of reproducing machines, when people 
had to be convinced that it was possible for them to 
take the high road as well a3 the low road, and when 
Carroll Brent Chilton went about preaching Bach and 
Beethoven through a pianola, to convince them. Now 
phonograph and player-piano companies codperate in 
the musical education of the music-lover with all sorts 
of literature, and it is no longer necessary to wonder

what some famous composition, praised in a musical 
history, may sound like, when ten to one it is in some 
roll or record. There are a number of books for 
looking up musical matters in general, the old friend 
of my youth, Lavignac’s “Music and Musicians ” 
(Holt); Elson’s “Book of Musical Knowledge ” 
(Houghton, Mifflin), Rupert Hughes’s “ Music Lover’s 
Cyclopedia” (Doubleday, Page). 
“The Study and Enjoyment of Pictures” by Ger- 
trude Brigham (Sully) is an unpretentious book, 
better illustrated than one would think from the price, 
and dealing with collections in this country as well 
as abroad. “The Art of Looking at Pictures,” by 
C. H. P. Thurston (Dodd, Mead), is almost a course 
of study in the appreciation of art. Maude Oliver’s 
“First Steps in the Enjoyment of Pictures” (Holt) 
is helpful. Percy Moore Turner’s “ Appreciation of 
Painting ” (Scribner) is another guide and friend for 
the intelligent onlooker. Charles Caffin’s “ How to 
Study Pictures” (Century) makes a history of paint- 
ing from the Renaissance. Reinach’s “ Apollo” 
(Scribner) is a history of art in all ages, translated 
from the French and profusely illustrated. The larger 
histories, such as the priceless “ History of Art” by 
Elie Faure (Harper) in which I so delight, would be 
useful only to one who had seen and to some degree 
studied many pictures and statues and read not a few 
books. Otherwise so many brilliant generalities would 
dull his perceptive faculties; the book would begin 
by dazzling and end by blinding him. Even Cot- 
terill’s “History of Art” (Stokes) which takes less 
for granted and has more pictures, is less an incentive

to study than a treasury for the student. The new 
English edition of Dr. Giulio Carotti’s “ History of 
Art” (Dutton), copiously illustrated like the other 
two, has the advantage for the student that its 
volumes — three out and one soon to come —are 
small square affairs convenient to carry about. This 
is a guide-book for gallery use. 
Talbot Hamlin Faulkner’s “ Enjoyment of Archi- 
tecture” (Scribner) did for me when it first appeared 
some years ago just what this inquirer hopes that a 
book will do, and it has been several times gratefully 
recommended to me by others. But in the last year 
a volume has appeared that is a model for this sort of 
interpretative criticism, “‘ The Significance of the Fine 
Arts,” published by Marshall Jones under the direc- 
tion of the Committee on Education of the American 
Institute of Architects. The first part is on classic, 
mediaeval, Renaissance and modern architecture, by 
famous architectural authorities who relate their sub- 
jects to civilization in general and to life itself, ex- 
plaining so clearly and in a spirit so ingratiating that 
the outsider is taken into the temple. The rest of 
the book introduces in like manner sculpture, paint- 
ing, landscape design, city planning, music and the 
industrial arts. The more books there are like this, 
the better for life; the more people read them, the 
wider grows the public upon whose appreciation, after 
all, the development of art in a democracy must 
depend.

lege but has travelled much, is unusually well in- 
formed on scientific and industrial matters and has 
a keen and alert mind. He confesses to a “deep 
hunger” for a real understanding of music, art 
and philosophy, “about which he can smatter as 
well as most university men.” His college-bred 
sister, to whom he applied for help in the choice 
of books for this purpose, tells the GuipE that 
“none of the books on philosophy, music and art 
which I encountered at college seem adapted to his 
needs: they are either too elementary, too detailed, 
or too technical. I want a historical survey with 
an intelligent modern viewpoint.” 
Ir there were more books like Elie Faure’s “ His- 
tory of Art” (Harper) I could make short work of 
this reply. It is not an introduction: for that H. B. 
Cotterill’s “A History of Art ” (Stokes) is better, for 
it is more detailed and takes for granted only such 
knowledge of art and of history as a modern educated 
adult can scarcely have escaped. Faure’s work is “a 
historical survey with an intelligent modern view- 
point,” but it is far more —it is a passionately in- 
teresting study of the spirit of man seeking expression 
in terms of its own day and generation. 
Remembering that Wells says in the “Outline” 
that “artistic productions . . . are the ornaments 
and expression rather than the creative substance of
-P-A-G-E-43
  
  SWEEPING THE FIELD 33 
history ” — a statement that throws some light on the 
art of Mr. Wells —I believe that one who reads the 
“ Outline ” should fill in the gap it leaves in the record 
of human development by passing at once to Faure. 
There is no such book for music and I do not see 
how there can be in our time. Like philosophy, music 
is forever beginning over, and just now it is in the 
midst of one of its periodical scrappings of the beliefs 
of yesterday. It is almost impossible for father and 
son, each a professional musician and a true product 
of his time, to discuss music today and get anywhere. 
They will be talking about different things. There is 
no use in begging the question by saying that Milhaud 
is not music. But the student who longs for a clue 
to the meanings of these new men, may read Cyril 
Scott’s “ Philosophy of Modernism” (Kegan Paul: 
London) and A. Eaglefield Hull’s “ Cyril Scott: Com- 
poser, Poet and Philosopher” (Dutton), and two 
books by Paul Rosenfeld, “ Musical Portraits” and 
“ Musical Chronicle” (both Harcourt, Brace), with 
Rosa Newmarch’s book on “The Russian Opera” 
(Dutton). 
Rémy de Gourmont says in one of the essays in 
“Decadence” (Harcourt, Brace) something to the 
effect that ideas tend to get wedged together in pairs, 
like crimepunishment, virtuereward, or chopsand- 
tomatosauce, and that it is the duty of the wise and 
great to pry them apart at least long enough to per- 
mit them to be examined separately. My admiration 
for the writings of George Santayana began when I 
found how they drove a wedge into those idea-jams 
philosophydullness and humorsuperficiality. These 
   
-P-A-G-E-44
    34 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
were tight together in the minds of the heavy-minded, 
who called Bergson “novelist ” and “ mountebank ” 
for his brilliant metaphors, and could not believe in 
the depth of Mark Twain’s ideas because they were | 
too well convinced that fun is shallow. Now Santa-— 
yana’s “ Character and Opinion in the United States ” 
(Scribner), which is a record of acquaintance with 
American philosophy and philosophers, opens with a 
metaphor like a searchlight and by the middle of the 
first page the reader is smiling — though if he is a 
New Englander it is a twisted smile. That is why 
I advise a young man in the case of the one indicated 
above, to try whether Santayana may not incline him 
toward that philosophy of life that he is seeking. 
For I can tell by the requests for “ first books for the 
study of philosophy ””— they come to me oftener 
almost than any other request — that what most of 
the inquirers are looking for is less philosophy than 
the philosopher’s stone. A very little pure philosophy 
is all the usual human being can stand: he shies 
away from its very vocabulary and must be led up 
to its methods as tenderly as a horse to an open 
umbrella. A book-adviser finds that advice on the 
approach to philosophy is a delicate and important 
matter. 
Philosophy is many-sided both in its problems and 
in its doctrines. The interest and the bias of the in- 
dividual determines the proper method of approach. 
Supposing that the inquirer is already familiar with 
science, he will do well to read Bertrand Russell, 
especially his “Scientific Method in Philosophy ” 
(Oxford University Press).
-P-A-G-E-45
  
SWEEPING THE FIELD 35 
If the inquirer is already interested in religion, he 
will be still further interested in William James, be- 
ginning with “ The Will to Believe and Other Essays ” 
(Longmans, Green). 
A familiarity with social questions suggests the ap- 
proach through ethics and philosophy of the state, 
through the works of Hobhouse, such as “The Ra- 
tional Good” (Holt). The artist, or one who wishes 
to approach by the method of criticism, will be led on 
by Santayana, and, for an introductory volume, the 
“Little Essays” (Scribner), selected from his longer 
works by the wise and sympathetic Logan Pearsall 
Smith, makes an ingratiating beginning. May Sin- 
clair’s “The New Idealism” (Macmillan) is a bril- 
liant, penetrating study of contemporary thought, not 
for the beginner, but immensely stimulating to one 
already interested in the subject. A little book with 
a long title, R. F. A. Hoernle’s “ Matter, Life, Mind 
and God” (Harcourt, Brace) is better for the reader 
yet unaccustomed to this kind of study.

PSYCHOLOGY 
“T realize the importance of a knowledge of psy- 
chology. Without any knowledge of its difficulty I 
attempted to read some of the best books; like 
the ‘ Psychology’ of William James, but they were 
too difficult for me. Again I want to attempt that 
subject ; I want a primer of psychology to give me 
an idea of some of its fundamentals and inspire 
me to continue. Can you suggest the right book?”
-P-A-G-E-46
  36 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
Turis letter stands for dozens like it, and dozens 
more ask for books to go on reading after this first 
book has been read. The most readable, intelligible, 
practical and thoroughly enjoyable of the books on 
introductory psychology is “ Psychology: a Study of 
the Mental Life,’ by Robert S. Woodworth. (Holt). 
It has all the essential facts up to the most modern 
movements, and its buoyant, vivacious style keeps the 
reader’s attention at concert pitch. It is not a 
“primer” of psychology; for that purpose Susan S. 
Brierley’s “ An Introduction to Psychology ” (Dodd) 
was prepared; this has the biological method of ap- 
proach. The only psychology prepared especially for 
the use of children is, so far as I know, Hallam 
Hawksworth’s “The Workshop of the Mind” (Cen- 
tury): it is conversational in tone and depends much 
upon anecdotes for illustration. 
After Prof. Woodworth’s book the reader will find 
that four textbooks, each written incisively and from 
its own point of view, will be especially valuable for 
further investigation. The first is William McDou- 
gall’s “ Outline of Psychology ” (Scribner), a work of 
wide appeal; Edward B. Titchener’s “ Textbook of 
Psychology” (Macmillan) is not so recent, but is 
highly valuable. The student of pedagogy will be 
interested in Edward L. Thorndike’s “ Educational 
Psychology ” (Teachers College) and John B. Wat- 
son’s “Psychology from the Standpoint of a Be- 
haviorist ” (Lippincott) is the leading work in this 
department. Branching into special fields he comes 
upon William McDougall’s “Social Psychology ” 
(Luce) now in its thirteenth edition, and Robert H. 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
  
  SWEEPING THE FIELD 37 
Gault’s new and valuable contribution to the sub- 
ject, “ Social Psychology: the bases of behavior called 
social” (Holt). “Instinct and the Unconscious,” by 
William H. Rivers (Cambridge University Press), is 
a safe and eminently sane selection for one interested 
in this field. 
These selections are made for the student who 
wishes to make a conscientious and disinterested sur- 
vey of this important field. But when a reader, or a 
program committee, asks me to advise books for an 
extended study of “ applied psychology,” I take pains 
to find out just what they mean by the words. There 
is a practical text-book, “ Applied Psychology,” by 
H. L. Hollingworth and A. T. Poffenberger (Apple- 
ton), which shows that an understanding of individual 
psychology helps greatly in making those adjustments 
necessary to right and effective living. But the term 
has been stretched unwarrantably to cover any num- 
ber of get-rich-quick systems for the mind, panaceas 
for success with a deplorable notion of what consti- 
tutes success. I can imagine nothing less desirable 
for a community than for its leading woman’s club 
to spend the entire winter in the unmitigated and 
undirected study of one of these. The danger in 
unguided collective study by amateurs is from the 
tendency to take everything stated as something es- 
tablished, whereas psychology is as yet largely ex- 
perimental. The scientific observer takes, for in- 
stance, a series of tests like those indicated by Dr. 
Downey in “The Will Profile” (Univ. of Wyoming 
Bull., XVI, 4, 1912) which utilizes handwriting in a 
variety of ways, and by careful comparison of results 
   
-P-A-G-E-48
  
  38 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
comes to the cautious statement that “it certainly 
affords, in many situations, a basis for conservative 
prophecy.” The unscientific method is to go by a 
hard-and-fast system of graphology. 
“Business psychology” is developing a literature 
of its own: here is a list suggested to a young execu- 
tive “very much interested in psychology as applied 
to getting action out of people.” As a basis, Wood- 
worth’s “ Psychology,” of course, and the standard 
work “Applied Psychology,” by Hollingworth and 
Poffenberger (Appleton), ‘Increasing Human Effi- 
ciency in Business,” by W. D. Scott (Macmillan), and 
the same author’s “Influencing Men in Business” 
(Ronald) ,” and “ Science and Common Sense in Work- 
ing with Men,” by Scott and Hayes (Ronald), books 
whose value is unquestioned. Carrying out the study 
along these lines into special fields, the new book by 
Rudolph Pintner, the latest developments in the im- 
portant field of “ Intelligence Testing” (Holt) by one 
of its foremost authorities; Hollingworth’s “ Judging 
Human Character” (Appleton) and his “ Vocational 
Psychology ” (Appleton), Link’s “ Employment Psy- 
chology” (Macmillan), J. C. Chapman’s “Trade 
Tests ” (Holt), and the “ Materials for a Study of the 
Self,” by Yerkes and LaRue (Harvard University 
Press). To these stand-bys add Strong’s “ Psychology 
of Selling Life Insurance” (Harper). Although its 
title sounds specialized, the book gives a good dis- 
cussion of the technique of “ getting action” in any 
situation. All these books are sound, readable, and 
practical and not one of them is padded. 
Returning for a moment to the original inquirer,
-P-A-G-E-49

who found William James as yet “too difficult ” for 
him, let him not regard this philosopher as lost to 
him, but only deferred; and if meantime he looks for 
a book that will act as an ideal introduction, let him 
read the English translation of T. Flournoy’s “ The 
Philosophy of William James” (Holt) whose lumi- 
nous clarity is worthy of the master it interprets to 
a foreign audience.

GETTING OVER THE GRIPPE 
“I am getting over the grippe; my intellect seems 
fairly healthy, but most of my other senses, in- 
cluding my sense of humor, need attention. I wish 
you would tell me some fiction to read, preferably 
of fairly recent issue, that will help to keep me out 
of the dumps.” 
I cer a letter like this often enough to have gath- 
ered in the course of making the replies a fairly large 
collection of what some people call “ comfort books ” 
and others “cheer-up books for when I am tired.” 
It is made largely of novels for a tired brain that is 
still a good brain. Some of them were gathered for 
a college-bred mother to read after a long day with 
the children, when she needed relaxation but not a 
complete slump. It might do the list no good with 
some people to learn that it began with a selection I 
made for the home for incurables; somehow it does 
not exactly pet a book to say it would be fine for in- 
curables. But this is what the letter said that asked 
for the selection: “The men in this home are inter- 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
  40 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
ested in books that will help them make the best of 
what is left.” That fits a good many of us, if we only 
knew it. When we are getting over the grippe we 
know it only too well. 
Of course no cheering book should be offered to 
anyone who has not definitely asked you for cheer, 
or at least begun to look about on the bookshelves for 
it. Cursed be he who cometh between me and my 
grouch until I have chewed the taste out of it. In 
the first batch of questions that came to the Gurpr a 
woman asked for “something to read to a convales- 
cent husband who cannot stand uplift.” Uplift is 
nothing to offer any husband, horizontal or otherwise, 
unless he asks for it. So I do not keep on hand for 
selection any of what the department stores call 
“books of cheer.” My own choice for cheerful read- 
ing would be a book like Percy Lubbock’s “ Roman 
Pictures ” (Scribner), only there are mighty few like 
it, the only one indeed that comes to my mind at once 
being Henry Festing Jones’s “ Castellinaria.” These 
are both sketches made in Italy, but Mr. Jones’s 
people are natives and Mr. Lubbock’s almost all 
English pilgrims and residents. You scarce notice 
that Mr. Lubbock’s scene is Rome because the people 
are so British and so interesting and all the time the 
background is soaking into the mind until, long after, 
you wonder when it was that you looked out from a 
balcony over the city, or wandered the Virgilian wood 
—and come to find out, it was in the book. People 
like to send their tired minds to Italy; no wonder 
Elizabeth chose it for “The Enchanted April” 
(Doubleday). Here is a book most people love for
-P-A-G-E-51
SWEEPING THE FIELD 41 
the jam on it, and I will admit that towards the end 
it is spread pretty thick, but some like it for the 
wholesome and digestible truth under the sweetness. 
This truth, of course, is that you never really know 
how to get along with those you love until you have 
learned how to get along without them. 
“Kai Lung’s Golden Hours,” by Ernest Bramah 
(Doran), is a book to keep in the house, which means, 
of course, the first to be borrowed out of it. Chinese 
stories moving demurely in flowery dress, contem- 
porary British slang translated into Chinese polite- 
ness, just enough suspense to tie them together into 
one narrative, and a pervasive fun that impels anyone 
who loves his neighbor to read the book out loud to 
him. E. Nesbit’s “The Wouldbegoods ” (Harper) is 
a happy old one and I have lent her “‘ The Red House ” 
at least a dozen times to convalescents: it is a kind 
and smiling story of two young people going to house- 
keeping. English novels smile more than ours, as a 
rule. E. F. Benson’s villagers and suburbanites are 
pinheads to be sure, but such lovable pinheads! 
Reading his “Queen Lucia” (Doran) or “ Miss 
Mapp” (Doran) —and either of. them can be de- 
pended on for convalescent reading —one wonders 
what would have happened to these ladies at the 
hands of a biographer from Winesburg, Ohio. Miss 
Mapp is that lady of whom it is said that “anger, 
and the gravest suspicions about everybody, had kept 
her young and on the boil.” In Janet Laing’s “ Win- 
tergreen” (Century), a Scotch spinster who can no 
longer afford a cook goes out and is one — with sur- 
prising results. These are all good books to rest on,
-P-A-G-E-52
  
42 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
but to get up steam on “ Colas Breugnon” (Holt) is 
great, and so is Chesterton’s “ Manalive.” I have 
lately seen this book on the “ New Books ” shelf of a 
public library, and I don’t wonder; something keeps 
it young and “on the boil.” John Buchan’s “ Hunt- 
ingtower ” (Doran) ought to make one forget a tem- 
perature; it has fighting all over the place, a captive 
beauty, and dodging about in the fray a delicious 
troop of Boy Scouts from the Edinborough slums. 
There is a special kind of book built on the model of 
an old-fashioned “ chase ” movie, in which events whiz 
by at a rate delightful to a quick reader and unen- 
durable to a slow one: an American example is 
Elmer Davis’s extravaganza, “ Times Have Changed ” 
(McBride) and a French one is “ Barnabé and his 
Whale” translated from Réné Thevenin by Ben Ray 
Redman (McBride). This begins by making it plau- 
sible that a man should live inside a museum whale 
and lead about a pet hippopotamus, and goes on from 
that. Well, Heywood Broun, in “The Sun Field” 
(Putnam) makes it perfectly plausible that a girl on 
the staff of an “ emancipated ” literary weekly should 
be happily married to a home-run king who insists on 
“respecting ” her, and that beats any hippopotamus. 
Mr. Roland Holt, in a magazine article on “ Books 
that Brace,” calls attention to the tonic effects of 
certain tragedies, the calm nobility of the Chinese 
princess in Hergesheimer’s “ Java Head” (Knopf) as 
a notable example. Beauty is never more needed than 
when one is tired. A grateful patient wrote back to 
the Guive that Dunsany’s “Don Rodriguez” (Put- 
nam) was “ more than a tonic.” Donn Byrne’s “ Mes- 
 
-P-A-G-E-53

ser Marco Polo” and “The Wind Bloweth” (Cen- 
tury) are worth a moderate illness if you can’t get 
time to read them in any other way. Why for that 
matter, who would not exchange rude and unbroken 
health for the chance to take a day off and read Jane 
Austen’s “ Love and Freindship” (Stokes) or Chris- 
topher Morley’s “Where the Blue Begins ” (Double- 
day Page), the works of Padraic Colum or the price- 
less “Crock of Gold” of James Stephens (Mac- 
millan) ? 
There’s no use beginning on the sea-stories for they 
are in a-class by themselves, nor on the detective 
stories, for most of us are like the hero of Maurice 
Baring’s “ Overlooked” who could not enjoy a novel 
unless it was a good novel, but who could and did 
enjoy any detective story good or bad. Anyone who 
wishes to go into this subject very thoroughly will 
find a large selection of books to read aloud to in- 
valids in “ The Hospital Library,” a little book by 
Edith K. Jones published by the American Library 
Association. 
When a client called for a novel to be read by his 
grandmother, a lady of high intelligence and advanced 
years, who had decided that if her mind was not 
improved by this time it never would be and that she 
would put in the rest of her reading on pleasant stories 
about the kind of people she liked, I advised “ Madam 
Claire” by Susan Ertz (Appleton), for this charming 
heroine is a grandmother too, and living her own life 
at a great rate. Also there is “In the Mountains,” 
published anonymously (Doubleday) but with no ef- 
fort to conceal its Elizabethan qualities; this was 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  44 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
written for “the ancient woman who sits at the end 
of my life.” Indeed, I know of no writer who can do 
more to pull a reader out of a sense that life is over, 
than this one can do—in “ The Pastor’s Wife,” for 
instance, or that admirable story for one recovering 
from a love-affair, “Fraulein Schmidt and Mr. 
Anstruther.” 
About the only quality that the books on this list 
have in common is that there is in them no deliberate 
and gratuitous trouble. When there is killing, the 
right people get killed. This is because the books 
were chosen for people with little troubles; for after 
all getting over the grip is not such a deadly business. 
The other day a lady wrote to thank me for having 
brought to her attention Hardy’s “ The Woodlanders ” 
which it chanced she had never read. It had taken 
her some time to get through, she said. It was her 
first book in Braille. When I came to that word it 
gave me something of a shock. I wondered if I would 
have recommended a book with such an ache of pity, 
with a truth so bitter, if I had known it must reach 
her through the slow touch of unaccustomed finger- 
tips. It spreads out the agony over so long a time to 
pick it out for one’s first book in Braille. But I found 
that by the time you are reading in Braille you have 
been through so much that you can stand a good deal, 
so long as it is true and honest. It is the mother who 
has lost a child and lived through it who can read 
“The Trojan Women” and be the braver. People 
who say they have enough unpleasantness in real life 
without looking for it in fiction generally take pains 
to avoid it in real life just as successfully.

FUNNY BOOKS 
“A friend of ours, slowly recovering from an illness, 
much enjoys reading or having read to him hu- 
morous, witty, funny books, like Mark Twain’s or 
Irvin Cobb’s. Not being familiar with books of 
this kind, we would appreciate a fairly long list of 
them.” 
Tue ideal audience for a professional humorist is 
one whose vitality is below par and who is reading to 
get it up again. You may be captious with humor as 
literature, but when the one thing you want is to be 
pried out of a gum of gloom you are grateful to any- 
one who will perform that feat. How he does it you 
should care no more than where the prestidigitator 
gets the rabbit. In such hours one naturally prefers 
the humorist who gives his whole mind to it. Life 
so bulges with unconscious humor that no one with 
health, eyes and ears needs a book to make him smile, 
but, when any of these get out of order, what is called 
for is humor not only conscious but on purpose. No 
wonder this patient likes Irvin Cobb: “The Life of 
the Party” and “ Speaking of Operations ” (Doran) 
take deliberate aim to please. They say Stephen 
Leacock saved Britain from cracking under the strain 
of the War; now that took strong-arm methods, like 
those in “ Nonsense Novels” or “ Further Foolish- 
ness ” (Dodd, Mead). “ Over the Footlights ” (Dodd, 
Mead), coming after the War, did not have to be so 
strenuous, but it is good for at least six hearty laughs 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
    46 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
from anyone who goes to the theatre. Judge Shute’s 
“The Youth Plupy” (Houghton, Mifflin) and “ Brite 
and Fair” (Grosset) belong to a friend of mine and 
I read them every time I go to see her, and howl 
aloud at the same places. What could be happier 
than hours with “Ruggles of Red Gap” by Harry 
Leon Wilson (Doubleday, Page)? Ellis Parker Butler 
has had grateful patients ever since “ Pigs is Pigs” 
(Doubleday, Page). Oliver Herford never wrote a 
dull book, and “ The Giddy Globe” (Doran) is one 
steady grin. Certain books I depend on to provide 
me with a good dose of fun, and they never fail. I 
keep all the works of Robert Benchley where I could 
put my hand on them in the dark, and often enough 
I have, too— “Of All Things” (Holt) and “Love 
Conquers All” (Holt). Neither do I let “The 
Cruise of the Kawa” (Putnam) get out of retriev- 
ing distance, and though I cherish Traprock’s later 
volumes, “My Northern Exposure” and “ Sarah 
of the Sahara ” (Putnam) largely for the sake of their 
predecessor, I cherish them. Octavus Roy Cohen’s 
“Polished Ebony” and the others in this group 
(Dodd, Mead) may not contribute to an understand- 
ing of the color question, but they are certainly funny. 
Margaret Breuning’s “ You Know Charles” (Holt) 
is a sort of feminine counterpart of Barry Pain’s 
“Eliza,” and that is praise indeed to one who knows 
Barry Pain. Pelham Wodehouse is one British 
humorist who has caught the American tempo without 
losing his native grace ; “ The Indiscretions of Archie ” 
(Doran), for instance, is light-footed as well as light- 
hearted, There is plenty of humor in A, Neil Lyons’s
-P-A-G-E-57
  SWEEPING THE FIELD 47 
collections of short stories, from “ A Market Bundle” 
to “Fifty Fifty” (Dodd, Mead), but it is sifted in 
among other tales grim as well as gay. Indeed, I like 
all British humorists, but in hours of depression I 
prefer the minor British humorists, they take such 
pains. It is so soothing to have them not only apply 
the tonic of a joke but be willing to rub it into the 
scalp. 
The American humorist does not so, you either get 
it or you don’t, you either like him as he is or you 
change your newspaper. For after all it is upon the 
newspapers that we depend for our daily dose of fun. 
But I find that my gratitude to newspaper humorists 
only begins from having found them funny. I read 
Don Marquis because he is deliciously funny, but I 
re-read his “ Prefaces” (Appleton) and “The Old 
Soak” (Doubleday) and I will leap upon “The 
Almost Perfect State” and “The Old Soak’s History 
of the World” as soon as they get into book form, 
because they are compact of joyous wisdom. I read 
Christopher Morley steadily because he provides me — 
apparently unconsciously — with a steady supply of 
reasons for continuing to put up with this human race. 
Thank heaven, the Bowling Green had taken shape in 
literature between covers — notably “Inward Ho! ” 
(Doubleday) — before it retired from daily journalism. 
I read F. P. A. because he is clever, but keep on read- 
ing him because he is a poet, and a poet with a strong 
sense of humor is in no danger of getting too almighty 
clever. I think, when it comes to giving a single 
reason for my turning to a column after one glance 
over the headlines, it is because I have come to be
-P-A-G-E-58
  48 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
convinced that this columnist sees things pretty 
straight. Keith Preston, for instance, has made a 
funny book of verses about books in his “ Splinters ” 
(Doran), whose fun drives home some uncommonly 
just book-criticisms. When I took a vow to myself, 
on reading “ The Outline of Sex: Euclid Unveiled ” 
(Holt), that from this time forth clients in search of 
literature on Freud would have this recommended to 
them whatever else they had, it was because it is 
humor steeped in common sense. And I do not know 
a book that goes deeper into the pathos of mimetic 
art than the book over which thousands have laughed, 
H. L. Wilson’s “ Merton of the Movies ” (Doubleday, 
Page). 
A really good parody is as likely as not to outlive 
the original, and more than likely to keep its original 
alive. When a correspondent asked me who was the 
author of “If I Should Die To-night,” I innocently 
told him it was Ben King; the incident is enshrined 
in Burton Stevenson’s “ Famous Single Poems ” (Har- 
court, Brace). It is no part of my duty here to point 
out the qualities of a good parody, but only to call 
attention to its durability. Twenty years from now, 
when “ This Freedom” shall have long since led the 
year’s sensations down to dusty death, Christopher 
Ward’s “ The Triumph of the Nut and Other Paro- 
dies ” (Holt) will be just as amusing. I know because 
four of the novels he treats I have not read, and I find 
these parodies as good reading as the others. Though 
of course they cannot all come to the level of the 
priceless one whose motto is “ With a great price 
($2) obtained I ‘This Freedom.’” Hutchinson

lends himself to travesty: Barry Pain does well by

Stewart’s “ Parody Outline of History ” is one of the 
most subtle criticisms of recent American fiction. 
“The Outline of Everything” by Hector B. Toogood 
(Little, Brown) is so demurely devastating that it 
may have the same effect on the production of further 
outlines as “ The Cruise of the Kawa” had on South 
Sea travel-books. “ Perfect Behavior” by Donald 
Ogden Steward (Doran) should be read by everyone 
whose nervous system has been affected by those dis- 
tressing advertisements that tell you what awful 
breaks you must have made. Books like this are 
good for years; my copy of Barry Pain’s “ Playthings 
and Parodies” is worn to rags from age and borrow- 
ing, and I could read Max Beerbohm’s “ A Christmas 
Garland” (Dutton) more often than I could some of 
the works on which it is based. “ Parodies Regained ” 
by “ Evoe ” (Methuen) is a property; this has a duet, 
presumably by Thomas Hardy and Alfred Noyes, that 
is actually a composite photograph of two literary 
styles. 
Slipping back into direct advice to a convalescent 
who needs to be cheered up, there is nothing better 
for doing it than funny scenes from familiar novels. 
The Victorians used to give us plenty of comic relief, 
but we get mighty little of it now. Oliver Onions, 
in “ Grey Youth” (Doran) has a boarding house that 
could almost stand comparison with Todgers’s, but 
these scenes of deliberate amusement are rare. De 
Morgan retains the habit, to the vast gratitude of 
convalescents, who have listened to many a chapter

in his comfortable indirect discourse; ‘ Joseph 
Vance ” is still the best-beloved of the majority. The 
Dickens-lover has the best choice when he needs funny 
reading. The dancing gayety in “ Pickwick” and 
“Nicholas,” the entrances of the Wilfers in “Our 
Mutual Friend,” the quarrel in “‘ Martin Chuzzlewit,” 
the carefree moments in every novel save “ David 
Copperfield” that can never quite forget its heart- 
ache, and “ Great Expectations” whose very humor 
is wild and sad —these are after all the standbys 
for reading aloud to convalescents. But the patient 
must have read the novels beforehand.

MUSICIANS 
What novels are concerned with musicians or have 
music as an important factor in their development ? 
WE all like to read novels that move along our own 
trade routes. “Is there a policeman in it?” said a 
traffic cop to whom a friend of mine confided that 
she was writing a novel. “Then I'll read it.” Libra- 
rians confessed to a fondness for Margaret Widde- 
mer’s fantasy, “A Rose Garden Husband.” Honoré 
Willsie told me that cowboys read cowboy novels, and 
not only read them with avidity but read practically 
nothing else. Young persons moving in or headed 
toward what outsiders call “the world of music” 
have a natural interest in stories concerned with that 
curious continent, but I can remember when they had 
not much choice. You read Elizabeth Sheppard’s 
“Charles Auchester,” of course (it is now in an edi- 
tion with notes and introduction by George P. Upton, 
McClurg), and Ossip Schubin’s “ Asbein,” dear to 
lovers of Sarasate; you drooped to Jessie Fothergill’s 
“ First Violin ” (Holt) and the prattle of Myrtle Reed. 
You had, of course, George Sand’s “Consuelo.” 
Followers of the art complained that it was not taken 
seriously in literature; they said Browning was the 
only poet who could have passed an examination at 
their hands, and pointed derisively to the curious 
composition of the orchestra providing dance music 
53 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
    54 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
for “Come into the Garden, Maud,” and its dancers 
“dancing in tune.’ Then came George Moore’s 
“Evelyn Inness ” — still, it seems to me, the most 
musicianly novel about a musician. Then — or was it 
before? — Huneker’s short stories began to appear in 
the Musical Courier, and the Vance Thompson group 
shot off “Mlle. New York” twenty years too soon, 
a sky-rocket in daylight. Various local musicians 
tried their hands at writing romances and failed as 
amusingly as musicians are apt to do when they at- 
tempt novel-writing. Anne Douglas Sedgwick told the 
truth about a woman virtuoso in “ Tante” (Century). 
About this time Romain Rolland’s “ Jean Christophe ” 
(Holt) was unrolling its ponderous folds; I would 
call this the best musical novel if it were not also so 
many kinds of a novel —if at all. The musical fiction 
shelf was by now a bookcase, the novels dividing into 
those whose interest was in action-studies of artists 
or composers and those that aimed to show musical 
society, professional or amateur. 
To the latter class belongs “ Our Little Girl” by 
Robert Simon (Boni), one of the best novels of the 
musical trade in New York, a detailed account of 
getting a girl through a debut at Aeolian Hall and a 
concert at Carnegie, told with steady sardonic humor. 
Stuart MacLean’s “ Alexis ” (Appleton) takes place in 
professional and amateur circles in a small American 
city. One should by no means omit the chapter in 
Sinclair Lewis’s “ Babbitt” (Harcourt, Brace) in 
which the Booster’s Club decides that an orchestra 
would be a good thing for Zenith. 
“Chanting Wheels,” by Hubbard Hutchinson (Put-
-P-A-G-E-65
  “IS THERE A NOVEL ABOUT—?” 55 
nam), is an idealistic account of what a composer 
could do in a steel mill if he could get the modern 
industrial vibrations into his system while composing. 
“ Sister Sue,” by Eleanor Porter (Houghton Mifflin), 
is about a music teacher who could have been a con- 
cert pianist if her art had not been sucked out of 
her by a lot of pleasant vampire relatives: a kind 
little book that must have comforted many music 
teachers. “Brass,” by Charles Norris (Dutton), 
opens with so accurate and at the same time so 
sympathetic an account, to the very last detail, of the 
struggles of a little music teacher in Harlem, some 
twenty years or so ago, that I defy anyone who has 
had any experience with the profession, directly or 
indirectly, to read it without some generous emotion. 
Only one on the inside, for instance, can quite get 
the pathos of the scene in which she prepares to pawn 
“ Grove’s Dictionary.” 
There is a violinist in Kathleen Norris’s “ Butter- 
fly ” (Doubleday, Page), and’ the little girl that be- 
haved so badly in one of Beatrice Harraden’s earlier 
novels because no one realized that she was a violin- 
ist with no outlet for her violin art, has lately re- 
appeared as the heroine of “ Patuffa” (Stokes). This 
is so truthful an account of life in the violin world of 
the late nineties that anyone who lived in it at that 
period will feel at home. “ Fiddler’s Luck,” by Robert 
Haven Schauffler (Houghton, Mifflin), is one of the 
exceptions to what I said about the inability of pro- 
fessional musicians to write novels; it is a gay little 
piece whose hero loses interest in an otherwise at- 
tractive girl when she bangs his accompaniments. 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
  56 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
Take heed, young ladies: play all you want for bassos, 
and take a chance on a tenor,*but play no piano part 
for a violinist on whom you have cast a sentimental 
eye, unless you really know how. 
The novels of E. F. Benson show love and under- 
standing wherever they treat of music, and they often 
do, whether in “ The Challoners ” with its delightful 
references to musical composition, or the elegant fraud 
in “Queen Lucia” (Doran) who always left off at 
the end of the slow movement of the Moonlight 
Sonata, because the next one was like sunlight after 
moonlight and of course not at all because the first 
one is easy and the second extremely hard. Henry 
Handel Richardson, the pen name of an English- 
woman, wrote “ Maurice Guest,” a novel that made 
some sensation on its appearance some years ago, and 
has just been reissued by Duffield. You may believe 
Du Maurier or not in the matter of hypnotic sing- 
ing, but when he talks about songs, whether in 
“ Trilby ” or “ Peter Ibbetson” (Harper), he knows 
what he is talking about. Jacob Wassermann’s 
“The Gooseman” (Harcourt, Brace) is all about 
a musician’s progress: it is shorter than “The 
World’s Illusion” by one volume, so the hero has 
just that much less emotional elbow-room. What- 
ever Willa Cather writes of music is written with 
sympathy and understanding; there are several good 
studies of musical temperaments and conditions in 
“ Youth and the Bright Medusa” (Knopf), and “ The 
Song of the Lark ” (Houghton, Mifflin) is a singer’s 
professional and spiritual development. 
Ethel Sidgwick is a novelist who seems always inter-

  “IS THERE A NOVEL ABOUT—?” 57 
ested in music and so thoroughly at home with it that 
whatever she writes will stand a musician’s closest 
scrutiny. “ Promise ” and “Succession ” (Small May- 
nard) are music through and through, and piquant in 
their humor besides. Anthony Pryde’s “Claire de 
Lune” (Dodd, Mead) and Elliott Paul’s “ Indelible ” 
(Houghton, Mifflin) tell of musicians’ marriages; 
John Palmer’s “ The Happy Fool” (Harcourt, Brace) 
of the marriage of a musical critic. The heroine of 
Catherine Carswell’s “The Camomile” (Harcourt, 
Brace) is a Scotch music teacher; the leading lady of 
Julian Street’s “ Rita Coventry ” (Doubleday, Page) 
a temperamental and tempestuous diva. There are 
not a few published plays about opera singers: Shel- 
don’s ever-blooming “Romance,” for instance, in 
Baker’s collection of “Modern Plays” (Harcourt, 
Brace), or Varesi’s “Enter Madame” (Putnam). 
The little that Tolstoy has to say about music in 
“The Living Corpse ” (Crowell), true as it is, scarce 
makes up for the bosh about it in “The Kreutzer 
Sonata.” “Tante” was dramatized, but the best 
piano virtuoso in the literature of the stage is in 
Hermann Bahr’s “ The Concert.” 
§ 11 
THE STAGE 
“What novels present stage life or have actors or 
actresses for leading characters?” 
A coMPLETE list of stage novels, which I do not 
pretend to give, would have some of the best and some
-P-A-G-E-68
  58 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
of the very worst in the history of fiction. ‘“ Penden- 
nis ” would be at one end with its immortal Fotherin- 
gay, and George Moore’s “ A Mummer’s Wife,” whose 
fat comedian and his “ Chimes of Normandie” com- 
pany were not born to die. Dickens has no surer hold 
on the future than through the Crummles family, 
deathless aggregation of ham actors. Leonard Mer- 
rick is at his best with the stage, as in “ The Man who 
was Good ” (Dutton), Arnold Bennett and his Denry 
at their most audacious. There are not a few plays 
about actors, and actors usually make a success with 
them — “ Peg Woffington,” “ David Garrick,” “ Tre- 
lawney of the Wells,” and of the newer ones Philip 
Moeller’s “ Sophie” (Knopf) about the great Sophie 
Arnould and her company, St. John Ervine’s “ Mary, 
Mary, Quite Contrary” (Macmillan), and Barrie’s 
delicate “ Rosalind” (Scribner). Pirandello’s master- 
piece of stage-philosophy, “ Six Characters in Search 
of an Author” (Dutton) has just been followed by 
another drama of the presentation of a play, “ Each 
in his own Way” (Dutton). “The Torchbearers ” by 
George Kelly (Amer. Library Service) is an irre- 
sistible presentation of a little group of serious actors. 
The actors who gave “Six Characters ” in this city 
were astonished to find how absorbed the first-night 
audience was in lines and situations in the first scene 
that they had scarcely noticed, still less thought inter- 
esting. Living on the business side of the footlights, 
how were they to know that when the curtain went up 
on a bare stage with an unshaded electric light and 
the scenery turned to the walls, everyone in the audi- 
torium would draw a sigh of bliss at being taken

““TS THERE A NOVEL ABOUT—?” 59 
behind the scenes —into fairyland? So there are not 
a few novels whose charm lies in the fidelity with 
which they set forth life on the road or at rehearsal 
—details dull enough to the professional. Marion 
Hill’s “The Toll of the Road” (Appleton) is good 
reading because it is evidently set down by someone 
who knows what she is talking about, and anyone who 
does can tell in a moment when a book has been 
written by one who does not. Virginia Tracy speaks 
from behind the scenes in “ Merely Players,” so does 
Henry Kitchell Webster in his stories, “ The Painted 
Scene” (Bobbs), so does Pelham Wodehouse in his 
musical comedy story “ The Little Warrior ” (Doran), 
so does Louise Closser Hale, whose “The Actress” 
and “The Married Miss Worth” are evidences of 
her double gift, for the stage and for writing. If you 
can believe that a man would buy a play in the off- 
hand fashion of Philip Curtiss’s hero in “ Mummers 
in Mufti” (Century), you have a faithful account of 
the complexities of licking it into shape. G. B. Stern’s 
“The Back Seat” (Knopf) presents with sardonic 
grace the problem of the actress’s consort, with which 
Elizabeth Corbett dealt in her “ Puritan and Pagan ” 
(Holt). In Compton Mackenzie’s “ The Vanity Girl ” 
(Harper) and L. N. Harker’s “ Allegra” (Scribner), 
the leading characters are actresses; H. S. Cooper’s 
“Sunny Ducrow” (Putnam) is a popular and in- 
credible story of the London halls; M. T. Daviess’s 
“ Blue Grass and Broadway ” (Century) and Gustav 
Kobbé’s “ All-of-a-Sudden-Carmen” (Putnam) have 
stage-settings. The morally versatile heroine of Stacy 
Aumonier’s “ Heartbeat” (Boni and Liveright) is 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
  60 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
married to the manager of “The Frolicks.” Clara 
Morris had a true talent for-writing: she showed it in 
a little story called “The Trouble Woman” (Funk 
and Wagnalls) which is still an honest comfort to 
people in hard luck, and in her novel “ A Pasteboard 
Crown.” Sarah Bernhardt signed “ Petite Idole,” 
translated here as “ The Idol of Paris” (Macaulay), 
and it is about an actress, but then the divine Sarah 
could convince herself so readily that she had written 
anything she had signed that I am not prepared to 
swear that she wrote all of this unaided. Gilbert 
Cannan is displeased with the stage and all its works 
in “ Mummery” (Doran). D. H. Lawrence’s “ Lost 
Girl” (Seltzer) either was with a super-show or he 
has made it seem so by sounding so many of its 
psychological overtones. 
The playwright figures in not a few novels; Mary 
Watts’s “The House of Rimmon” (Macmillan) 
shows what sometimes happens to a play after the 
author lets go of it. In Thomas Beer’s “The Fair 
Rewards” (Knopf) the central figure is a manager, 
and the book takes in a large part of New York’s 
theatrical history. 
§ 12 
ARCHITECTS 
What are some of the books about architects or 
involving architecture as Wassermann’s “ Goose- 
man” involves music? Books like Walpole’s 
“The Cathedral” or Ibanez’s “The Shadow of 
the Cathedral,” in which buildings are backgrounds, 
need not be included.
-P-A-G-E-71
  “IS THERE A NOVEL ABOUT—?” 61 
J. D. Brresrorp was an architect before he began to 
write novels, and so is the hero of his Jacob Stahl 
trilogy. In its first volume, “The Early History of 
Jacob Stahl” (Doran), there is the grind of a great 
office with the high adventure of setting up in busi- 
ness for one’s self. Thomas Hardy is another archi- 
tect become novelist, and his experience comes out 
every now and then in his books: in “ The Laodicean ” 
(Harper) the hero is shown in the exercise of his 
profession. Bosinney in Galsworthy’s “Man of 
Property” (Scribner) is the architect engaged to 
build Soames Forsyte’s house, and his fate is bound 
up with it through the whole “Forsyte Saga” 
(Scribner). In more obvious fashion a Fifth Avenue 
house figures in Arthur Train’s “ His Children’s Chil- 
dren” (Scribner) as a visible shape of the “ tainted 
money ” that built it and the costly-ugly civilization 
to which it belonged. 
The cathedral in Hugo’s “ Hunchback of Notre 
Dame” really takes part in the action and is, in a 
manner of speaking, the plot. Dickens was haunted 
by architecture as men are by music; Rochester 
Cathedral broods over “The Mystery of Edwin 
Drood,” he chooses a loved old building for the last 
peace of Little Nell, and takes delight in the details 
of inn-building, as in “ Barnaby Rudge,” and in do- 
mestic architecture in “ Bleak House.” But I doubt 
if he knew it from a practical viewpoint: I never 
could see how young Martin Chuzzlewit learned 
enough in the time he was with Pecksniff to plan a 
prize grammar school. 
A house is the pedal note in the harmony of How-

62 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
ells’s “The Rise of Silas Lapham” (Houghton, 
Mifflin). The house in which Jacob Dolph lived for 
the first years of the century, the fair and gracious 
dwelling now the Mission of Our Lady of the Rosary 
on State Street, lives in literature through H. C. Bun- 
ner’s “Story of a New York House” (Scribner). 
The men who figure in the first part of the book used 
to resort to Huggins’s barber shop to talk politics, 
where the First National Bank now stands: after the 
barber shop went, Halleck’s “ Ugly Club” used to 
meet in the office building on that site. James Lane 
Allen’s “‘ Heroine in Bronze” (Macmillan) was built 
around a house on West 54th street, opposite the 
University Club. He had spent hours in studying it 
from across the street or walking by, but it was not 
until the novel was finished that it occurred to him 
to ask who lived there. It was the home of John D. 
Rockefeller. How do I know all this? Out of A. B. 
Maurice’s “The New York of the Novelists ” (Dodd, 
Mead). 
No one has more than put St. Patrick’s into the 
background of a tale, and so far as I know, St. John 
the Divine’s figures only in J. L. Allen’s “ A Cathedral 
Singer” (Century). The Church of the Transfigura- 
tion was the subject of a popular ballad with a litho- 
graphed cover in colors; I’ve seen it in antique shops; 
also there is.a movie with the title “ The Little Church 
Around the Corner.” “ Low Ceilings,” by W. D. 
Newton (Appleton), is the story of a young British 
architect’s struggle for spiritual independence. Clay- 
. hanger’s stepson, George Cannon in “ The Roll-Call” 
(Doran), is a prosperous member of the profession,
-P-A-G-E-73
  “IS THERE A NOVEL ABOUT—?” 63 
Robert Herrick’s “The Common Lot ” (Macmillan), 
an early novel, is about an architect. Christopher 
Hare’s “ Felicita”” has been reported to the GurvE as 
a novel that centres in the Cathedral of Siena. 
Of all recent French fiction writers I find the 
deepest sympathy for architecture in Marcel Proust. 
Read the minute and loving descriptions of the porch 
of Saint-André-des-Champs — “ how typically French 
that church was! ” — and of the steeples of Vieuxvicq 
and Martinville in the volumes of “ A la Recherche du 
Temps Perdu,” translated as “ Swann’s Way ” (Holt). 
And in George Russell’s (““ AE’) study of the revolu- 
tionary spirit, “The Interpreters” (Macmillan), the 
young architect about to die with the other insurgents 
tells the truth about intrinsic beauty in words I wish 
every house builder or decorator had by heart. 
§ 13 
THE CLERGY 
“How do clergymen appear in fiction, English and 
American?” 
Come to look into it, the clergy haven’t been what 
you could call petted by British fiction. In Jane 
Austen’s novels the Church is an occupation, in Trol- 
lope’s a career. Nothing came near his dispassionate 
and sympathetic treatment of clergymen until J. D. 
Beresford devoted a large part of “ A Candidate for 
Truth ” (Doran) to the most subtle study of this type 
of clergyman in modern fiction. Dickens dances all 
round Stiggins and Chadband; Charlotte Bronté:-
-P-A-G-E-74
64 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
shows not only her tongue but her teeth in “ Jane 
Eyre” and the scenes with the curates in “ Shirley.” 
Thackeray melts to tenderness for parsons even in 
“The Book of Snobs ” and has a soft spot for Charles 
Honeyman and the gambling parson in “The Vir- 
ginians.” George Eliot is not only kind but just, even 
to the Laodicean Irvine in “ Adam Bede,” even to 
Dinah Morris preaching on the green — and she gives 
the sermon at that. Samuel Butler puts the torpedo 
under the ark in “The Way of All Flesh ” (Dutton) ; 
it was not so much Theobald he was after as the cloth 
in general. 
In present day fiction the standing of the ministry 
has improved. Wells took a serious interest in “ The 
Soul of a Bishop ” (Macmillan). Galsworthy’s rector 
in “Saint’s Progress” (Scribner) has a heart-break- 
ing time, but only because, being a saint, he was 
bound to get into complications with progress. Bar- 
rie’s ministers, little and otherwise, drew along with 
them Crockett’s ‘“‘Stickit Minister” and those in 
“The Bonnie Briar Bush.” There is a fine clergyman 
in Archibald Marshall’s “Exton Manor” (Dodd, 
Mead) with a wife only Trollope’s Mrs. Proudie can 
surpass. We have had the theological doubter like 
“ Robert Elsmere,” a type that merged into the socio- 
logical comeouter in Churchill’s “ The Inside of the 
Cup ” (Macmillan). “The Church on the Avenue,” 
(Dodd, Mead) by Helen R. Martin is a recent ex- 
ample of this kind of story. Robert Keable’s “ Per- 
adventure” (Putnam) has more theology in it than 
his earlier clerical fiction. The immensely successful 
play about a clergyman, Channing Pollock’s “The 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
  “TIS THERE A NOVEL ABOUT—?” 65 
Fool,” is published in book form (Brentano). “A 
Minister of Grace,” by Margaret Widdemer (Har- 
court, Brace), is a set of short stories of a mild didac- 
tic tendency ; in her first real novel, “Graven Image ” 
(Harcourt, Brace), there is a strong presentation of 
a family that functions for years on the reputation of 
a returned missionary and their own conviction that 
they are always right. The roughest treatment that 
a missionary has received in literature, however, is in 
Somerset Maugham’s “ Miss Thompson,” the story in 
“ The Trembling of a Leaf” (Doran) from which was 
made the play “ Rain.” It would appear from this 
play that it is safer for a saint to be also a martyr; 
a saint in the saddle rides rough-shod. 
The gentlest clergyman in American fiction is the 
delightful Dr. Lavendar of Margaret Deland’s “ Old 
- Chester Tales,” “The Awakening of Helena Ritchie,” 
and the rest of this group (Harper) in which he 
appears. And if missionaries should need rehabilita- 
tion after “ Rain,” read the altogether adorable stories 
of “Black Sheep: Adventures in West Africa” by 
Jean Kenyon MacKenzie (Houghton, Mifflin), for this 
lady is a missionary herself and her book is a wise, 
tender, and quite indescribable affair. She has 
another wonderful book of them in “ African Adven- 
tures ” (Doran). 
It is a young curate in “ Penrod” who calls that 
hero a “ little gentleman ” with historic consequences. 
A clergyman’s love-problem is the plot of Dorothy 
Easton’s “ Tantalus ” (Knopf), her first novel after a 
distinguished appearance as a writer of short stories. 
Fred E. Wynne’s “A Mediterranean Mystery” 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
  66 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
(Duffield) is an adventure story of Sussex and the 
Orient, with two sensible and charming gentlemen in 
holy orders taking all the honors. Phyllis Bottome 
in “ The Kingfisher ” (Doran) fulfils the hopes raised 
by her earlier and slighter productions with the record 
of spiritual development in the hard life of a sort of 
lay-preacher. Compton Mackenzie begins in “The 
Altar Steps” (Doran) what is promised as a series of 
novels about a minister’s change of heart. Corra 
Harris’s series of “Circuit Rider” novels is brought 
to a close by her recent “My Son” (Doran). We 
have a few pathological cases besides the one in 
“ Rain,” like the father in May Sinclair’s “ The Three 
Sisters ” (Macmillan) or the hero of Maxwell’s “ The 
Ragged Messenger.” When Sinclair Lewis was ac- 
cused of putting no religion into “Main Street ” he 
provided Zenith City in “ Babbitt ” (Harcourt, Brace) 
with John Jennison Drew, the “ wizard soul-winner.” 
At this moment of writing, Bernard Shaw’s “ Saint 
Joan ” is not yet available to the public in book form, 
but from seeing it upon the stage and reading it in 
manuscript I have been convinced that this is not 
only one of the most valuable contributions to a dis- 
cussion now at the highest point in recent years, but 
a presentation of a group of ecclesiastics, sincere, high- 
minded and well-intentioned every one of them, that 
can scarce be matched for skilful and sympathetic 
treatment at the hands of their presenter. Brentano 
is to be its publisher; no doubt it will have appeared 
before this does. 
There have been several recent additions to the 
gallery of clergymen in British fiction that will rank
-P-A-G-E-77
“IS THERE A NOVEL ABOUT—?” 67 
with any portraits placed there by former writers. 
Hugh Walpole, in “ The Cathedral” (Doran), gives 
the world a study in love of power, undermined and 
brought down by clerical intrigue—a study in the 
vein of Trollope. E. N. Delafield’s “The Optimist ” 
(Macmillan) is a loving father whose life is devoted, 
not to his real children, but to the personalities with 
which his love has invested them, and which he has 
so firmly made up his mind they possess that — as 
they love him too — their lifelong struggle is to keep 
their real elbows from sticking out through the paren- 
tal dream. Sheila Kaye-Smith, in “The End of the 
House of Alard” (Dutton), brings its long history to 
a close with the entrance of the last Alard into a 
monastic order, and the religious element in the book 
is healthy and not didactic. Latest of the clergy to 
feature in fiction at the time of this writing comes 
the unheroic hero of May Sinclair’s “A Cure of 
Souls” (Macmillan), a study in hedonism. There is 
surely nothing wrong in being comfortable, and even 
a determination to be so may not always wreck a 
character, but before this marvellous study is com- 
pleted one is reminded that the one profession in 
which being thoroughly comfortable is thoroughly 
dangerous is that of the clergy. It is facilis descensus 
to a special clerical hell: But unless one admits a 
hell in the hereafter, this Canon Chamberlain will 
escape it altogether; Miss Sinclair is too true an artist 
to bring down upon him an artificial retribution; he 
ends the book as he began, in a state of “ exquisite 
saturation.” He only has fatty degeneration of 
the soul.

GYPSIES 
“Gypsy literature fascinates me: Borrow delights 
me: what books about gypsies are there, and in 
what novels do real gypsies appear?” 
Tue 226 pages of “A Gypsy Bibliography ” by 
George Fraser Black (Quaritch, 1913) and the files 
of the Journal of the Gypsy Lore Society will give 
the student who is also an enthusiast —as all stu- 
dents of this subject are—an idea of the riches in 
store for him. Books keep on being added to them, 
too; one of the best in years is the record of personal 
experience with gypsies in Spain, by Dr. Irving Brown 
in “ Nights and Days on the Gypsy Trail” (Harper). 
Of the older baoks I remember with peculiar clearness 
the flashing pages of “In Gypsyland,” now out of 
print, by Joseph and Elizabeth Pennell. Charles 
Godfrey Leland’s “ The Gypsies ” (Houghton, Mifflin) 
and Mrs. Pennell’s “Life of Leland” (Houghton, 
Mifflin) are famous. Sir Richard Burton’s “ The Jew, 
the Gypsy and El Islam” (Hutchinson, 1898) and 
“The Life, Writings and Correspondence of George 
Borrow ” by William Knapp (London, 1899) belong 
on a list like this. Should you wish to start someone 
on a lifelong love of Borrow by giving him a little 
book that tastes like more, there is the volume called 
“Readings from Borrow” in that excellent series 
called “ King’s Treasuries ” (Dutton), a sort of young 
cousin to Everyman’s. These little books are so light 
that they are scarcely felt in a knapsack or pocket,   
 
-P-A-G-E-79
  “IS THERE A NOVEL ABOUT—?” 69 
yet the print is comfortably large, which makes this 
Borrow anthology good company on the road even for 
one who has long since read “ Lavengro,” “ Zincali,” 
and “The Bible in Spain.” These, by the way, are 
all in “ Everyman’s,” whose comfortable little volumes 
are so well suited for transportation that long-distance 
walkers provisioning for the road should first of all 
provide themselves with the catalogue. 
As to whether gypsies in novels are “ real”* or not, 
in the absence of personal experience I must content 
myself with naming some of those that convince 
readers that they are real. Kiomi, in “The Adven- 
tures of Harry Richmond ” by George Meredith, who, 
says Arthur Symons, “surges out of his pages pure- 
blooded, passionate and beautiful.” The gypsy girl 
in Sheila Kaye-Smith’s “Green Apple Harvest ” 
(Dutton) with her curious ophidian charm. The wild 
creatures in Konrad Bercovici’s “ Ghitza ” (Boni) and 
the gypsy chief in his “ Murdo” (Boni). The girl 
in Arthur Symon’s “ Knife Thrower,” which he says 
| he wrote about a girl he met in Warwick, and which 
Meredith admired. There is a chapter on Sir Richard 
Burton in Arthur Symon’s “Dramatis Personae” 
(Crowell) which brings out his affiliation with gypsies. 
Even that long-winded and shambling novel of Theo- 
dore Watts-Dunton’s, “ Aylwin,” quickens its pace and 
becomes vivid with the entrances of Sinfi Lovell and 
her prattle of dukkerippens and trushuls. 
There is more about the American Gypsy in Le- 
land’s “ The Gypsies” (Houghton, Mifflin) than in 
any other book as yet; it has also sketches of English, 
Welsh, Russian and Austrian Romany. The Gypsy

Lore Society was revived after the war and its Journal 
is still published; anyone interested in gypsies may 
become a member by a subscription of a pound a 
year. The Honorary Secretary is Mr. T. W. Thomp- 
son, Repton, Derby, England. 
§15 
DOGS 
“What stories and appreciations of dogs are famous 
in literature or deserve to be?” 
Att Maeterlinck’s dogs, to begin with, and all 
Galsworthy’s. These men seem never quite able to 
forget the sardonic tragedy of being a dog in a world 
of men. It has: some points in common with the 
tragedy of being a human being. 
There’s “ Rab and his Friends ” (Everyman’s) and 
Maida, and the dog that waited for Ulysses, and the 
fairy dog Petitcru that Tristram gave Iseult, as told 
in the enchanting “Romance of Tristram and 
Iseult,” by Thomas of Britain (Dutton), and Marshall 
Saunders’s “ Beautiful Joe,” beloved of the S.P.C.A., 
and Bill Sykes’s dog, which I think is the most 
doggish in fiction. There is John Muir’s “ Stickeen ” 
(Houghton), and the adventures in Jack London’s 
“Call of the Wild,” “Jerry of the Islands” and 
“ Michael, Brother of Jerry” (Macmillan). There is 
E. A. Mills’s “ Story of Scotch” (Houghton), and if 
little children have their say Thornton Burgess’s 
“ Bowser the Hound” in the Green Meadow Series 
(Little, Brown) will get past the children’s librarians  
-P-A-G-E-81
  “IS THERE A NOVEL ABOUT—?” 71 
and break into any literary dog-show. I am told that 
some folks think Albert Terhune’s collies know too 
much; I spend my summers in Vermont and nothing 
told of a shepherd dog can surprise me. There was 
one tale of his, though, in which a brave animal 
paused to quote poetry before breaking into a burn- 
ing building to save a lady friend —that did seem a 
bit strong. Upon reading it over I found, however, 
that it had been Mr. Terhune quoting the poetry and 
not the dog, but the effect had been produced. How- 
ever, I know enough about collies to believe in “ Lad ” 
(Dutton), and “ Buff” (Doran), and “ Bruce” (Dut- 
ton), “His Dog” (Dutton), and “ Lochinvar Luck ” 
(Doran) ; enough to approve of Katherine Lee Bates’s 
college story of “ Sigurd, our Golden Collie” (Dutton) 
and the set of stories in J. T. Foote’s ‘“‘ Dumb-bell of 
Brookfield” (Appleton). “Baldy of Nome,” by 
Esther Darling (Penn), is the story of a real racing 
dog of Alaska. “The Whelps of the Wolf,” by 
George Marsh (Penn), is another exciting story of 
these working dogs of the cold country: he has a lot 
of them in his stories of “Toilers of the Trail” 
(Penn). “ Wolf, the Storm Leader ” by Frank Cald- 
well (Dodd, Mead) is about another Alaskan dog. 
Hugh Walpole has a new dog story in “ Jeremy and 
Hamlet ” (Doran). 
There has just been a remarkable addition to our 
dog literature through the translation of Thomas 
Mann’s beautiful “ Bashan and I” (Holt). It is a 
study of the mind, soul and character of — well, call 
him a setter, though Mann seems dubious about it. 
I read twenty pages and then refused to go a line
-P-A-G-E-82
  72 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
further until I had made sure, by reading the last 
sentences, that Bashan was alive when the book was 
written. Dogs die too often in real life, as it is; I will 
not stand dog-deaths in literature. But Bashan is 
still gloriously up and coming; even the rabbit that he 
chases into the arms of his master gets off unharmed. 
“Nancy” is a dog biography by Louis Dodge 
(Scribner), a true and loving book. Another new dog 
is Mabel Robinson’s popular “ Dr. Tam O’Shanter ” 
(Dutton). Vassar College has rounded up any num- 
ber of literary dogs and devoted a section of its library 
to them; Walter Dyer’s “Gulliver the Great” | 
(Century), Ian Hay’s “Scally”” (Houghton), Alfred 
Ollivant’s “Bob, Son of Battle” (Doubleday, 
Page), R. H. Davis’s “ The Bar Sinister ” (Scribner), 
and Walter Dyer’s “ The Dogs of Boytown” (Holt). 
This list will of course set dog-lovers complaining be- 
cause some special favorite is not on it, but one must 
stop somewhere. But whoever stays out must not be 
the dog in “ The Story of Dr. Dolittle ” (Stokes) who 
could smell his way over the ocean, and of whose 
actuality thousands of children are convinced, nor the 
adorable Riquet immortalized by Anatole France. It 
will be remembered that this is the puppy that 
adopted M. Bergeret, the little creature of wistful 
charm. Also there is, in French, Octave Mirbeau’s 
“ Dingo ” in which the dog is used, as Swift used the 
horse, for the purpose of satire. 
There are not a few excellent dog-stories for children 
in the new book-lists ; “ Little Dog Ready ” by Mabel 
Stryker (Holt) is a charming one for little children 
to read, with forty illustrations by Hugh Spencer.  
-P-A-G-E-83
  “IS THERE A NOVEL ABOUT—?” 73 
Another for a child’s reading is “Charlie and his 
Puppy Bingo” (Macmillan), by Hill and Maxwell, 
and, for just a trifle older, “Little Lucia and her 
Puppy,” by Mabel Robinson (Dutton). These are 
all based, apparently, on the excellent idea that if a 
child can find in a book the circumstances of his 
daily life, illuminated by the magic of print, he will 
be as much interested in that book as if it were about 
fairies, and at an early age even more so. Flora 
| Shaw’s “Castle Blair,” that Ruskin liked so well, is 
in a new edition (Little, Brown), and there are two 
fine new ones about trick dogs, “ The Black-Eyed 
Puppy,” by Katherine Pyle (Dutton), and “ Here, 
Tricks, Here! ” by Lebbeus Mitchell (Little, Brown). 
There are collections of true stories, ‘The Book of 
Noble Dogs,” by Estelle Ross (Century), “Dog 
Heroes of Many Lands,” by Sarah Noble Ives (Cen- 
tury), for somewhat younger readers, and “ Puppy 
Dog’s Tales ” (Macmillan) for little ones. There are 
collections of poems about dogs like “To Your Dog 
and My Dog,” edited by L. N. Kinnicutt (Houghton), 
and Robert Frothingham’s “ Songs of Dogs ” (Hough- 
ton), and a new anthology of prose and poetry, “‘ The 
First Friend,” edited by Lucy Menzies (Dutton), 
which begins in ancient Persia and takes in writers 
as recent as J.C. Squire. And for a grand climax and 
combustion there is “Lola,” by Henny Kinderman 
(Dutton), told as the true story of two talking dogs, 
marvellous as the horses of Elberfeld. If this 
book is true it is the most extraordinary dog-story in 
print. Well, it may be at that; all a dog needs to 
make him talk is someone to show him how. A cat

refrains from speech because she thinks it a low form 
of exercise fit only for dogs or humans, but nothing 
but physical disability keeps back a dog’s torrent of 
conversation. Hear him in “The Blue Bird,” where 
he gets a chance at last! 
§ 16 
LIFE IN NEW YORK 
“I am coming to New York this winter to study and 
would like a list of books dealing with life in New 
York City, including especially such novels as you 
think would be helpful to a young person starting 
in life after leaving college.” 
Tue New York in which you will live depends 
upon your income. No, not in the way you think I 
mean. Simply because according as you live in a 
furnished room, apartment-house of one type or 
another, or any one of the grades of hotels, you will 
eat your meals, store your possessions — or dispose of 
them for lack of storage-room—entertain your 
friends, spend Sunday, in a word, perform the various 
functions of civilized life, according to the conditions 
imposed upon you by the space on which you pay 
rent or its equivalent. In general you will be sur- 
rounded by people similarly conditioned, who make 
with you one of the little worlds within the world of 
the five boroughs. However, these worlds not only 
overlap, but are so far from being impenetrable that 
anyone at all exceptional—and most people are if 
they only know it — can go visiting all over the muni- 
cipal solar system, making friends with scarce more
-P-A-G-E-85
  “IS THERE A NOVEL ABOUT—?” 75 
equipment than his own merits and appropriate 
clothes. So by the time you are established here and 
have a home of your own you can have gathered to 
come to it a group of friends who have been chosen 
as individuals and for their qualities, not on the subur- 
ban basis of propinquity. This is, I think, the rarest 
possibility that New York has to offer, a minor in- 
ducement being that this is the only town in the 
United States where it is possible to purchase a 
quarter-pound of butter without losing face. 
So you will see that any novel that shows how life 
is lived in some New York world may come in handy 
in your first year, and no one novel will be a com- 
pendium of how New York lives. Alexander Black’s 
“ The Great Desire ” (Harper), has never been beaten 
as a novel of the city at large, a presentation of the 
city’s spirit in a great number of its characteristic 
forms. Ernest Poole’s “ His Family” (Macmillan) 
is but a shade away. Mr. Poole has taken his city at 
the moment — it recurs as each great wave of change 
reaches its height in this changing city — when a man 
realizes with a peculiar sharpness that his grand- 
children have not the least idea what his New York 
was like. Alexander Black has a new novel of the 
city, “Jo Ellen” (Harper) which takes place for the 
most part in the Inwood region, around Spuyten 
Duyvil, where the forest is not so far back in the 
memory. 
If you want to know what novels were written about 
the city up to the time A. B. Maurice’s “The New 
York of the Novelists” (Dodd, Mead) was written, 
1917, you will find them all set down therein, but 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
  
76 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
you will have to look for the book itself in shops or 
libraries, for it is out of print. Rupert Hughes’s 
novel, “Within These Walls” (Harpers) is con- 
cerned with the growth of New York from 1830 to the 
present. We have now reprints of the earlier novels 
of Sinclair Lewis (Harcourt), of which I still like best 
“Our Mr. Wrenn.” This is genuine New York; a shy 
little fellow from up-state lives in a furnished room, 
works in a novelty company, swings round the circle 
of dairy-lunches, and is at last rescued by a warm- 
hearted boarding-house. To make the rounded tale 
complete he marries into a Bronx flat, with an eye 
toward “a place over in Jersey.” Nothing is yet 
seriously out of date save the prices; you cannot now 
get room and board on East Thirtieth Street for $11.50 
a week. Grant Overton’s “Island of the Innocent ” 
(Doran) has unusual glimpses of institutional life, 
hospital work, and getting a living in general. His 
new thriller, “The Thousand and First Night” 
(Doran), takes place on Long Island with flashbacks 
to Tangier and the isles of the Pacific. Margaret 
Ashmun’s “ Topless Towers” (Macmillan) is one of 
the few stories that show the daily problems of a 
flat shared by two unmarried women, the real prob- 
lems, not the bogey ones. Helen Hull’s “ Labyrinth” 
(Macmillan) is a novel of Morningside Heights and 
the university society thereabouts ; incidentally it sets 
a case fairly for the problem of a married woman’s 
working out of the home when she has children. 
Hutchinson made things too easy for Rosalie; he can’t 
make me believe it is as simple as that to swing house- 
hold expenses on any money she could have made in
-P-A-G-E-87
  
  “IS THERE A’ NOVEL ABOUT—?” 77 
business. Miss Hull’s heroine comes to an impasse 
at the close of the book, though there is every sign 
that the author would far rather she made a go of it. 
Sinclair Lewis’s “ The Job” (Harcourt) is still to me 
the best novel about a woman in an office, but Charles 
Norris has even more local color in his “ Bread ” 
(Dutton). This tells so much about life in drab 
“apartments ” on the upper West Side, that no one 
wonders the girl who starts life there takes to office 
work, however depressing Mr. Norris may find it. 
The essays of Robert Cortes Holliday take in more 
charming corners of the city than those of any other 
writer: read “Turns About Town” or “ Broome 
Street Straws,” for instance (Doran). But before 
you get any novels about this city, get “ Rider’s Guide 
to New York” (Macmillan). The old edition was 
great but this one is marvellous. I was born in this 
town and may not hope ever to have the magnificent 
familiarity with it that comes at the end of the first 
two-weeks’ visit, so I am not above taking this amaz- 
ing little volume on my trips about this metropolis and 
never once has it gone back on me, nor left a sojourn- 
ing relative unprovided. One may eat in a new lan- 
guage every night for a considerable period, spend the 
rest of one’s life here or make the best of a ten-day 
trip, on the advice of its neatly arranged pages. There 
is a new edition (Harper) of Thomas A. Janvier’s 
friendly blend of history and topography in “In Old 
New York.” Robert Shackleton’s “Book of New 
York ” (Penn) is full of information and illustrations ; 
Helen Henderson’s “A Loiterer in New York” 
(Doran) is the best guide to art and architecture to

read before coming or after one has returned; the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art publishes a number of 
guides to its collections, which may be bought there, 
and has a noble collection of reproductions on sale. 
Putnam issues “Statues of New York,” by Sanford 
Saltus and Walter Tisne, with 82 full-page photo- 
graphs of every portrait memorial we have reared in 
bronze or marble to keep alive the memory of gentle- 
men most of whom we will learn about for the first 
time through reading the letter-press of this book. 
There is an admirable reserve about this letter-press. 
The necessity for it will be recognized by anyone who 
knows our statues. 
§17 
DISAPPEARANCES 
“I am interested in mystery stories involving dis- 
appearances, like ‘ Edwin Drood.” 
So am I. I can even remember them after I have 
read them, which is more than I can do for any other 
type of detective story. Perhaps this is because they 
involve a personality and the others only a problem, 
and who cares what happens to A and B after they get 
the cellar dug? I can read any good detective story 
for the second time a year after and have not an idea 
how it is coming out, but after one reading a year 
ago I could still tell the plot of “The Old Madhouse ” 
(Holt) which William De Morgan left unfinished as 
Dickens did “ Drood.” But it is unfinished only in 
the sense that De Morgan’s own manuscript stops; 
Mrs. De Morgan went on with the story in the direc- 
tion that her collaboration with her husband showed
-P-A-G-E-89
  
“IS THERE A NOVEL ABOUT—?” 79 
her it would have taken. The concluding sentences 
do not so much imitate his style as make you think 
that the original story-teller had suddenly said, 
“Come now, we'll never be through at this rate: 
Tl just tell you what the rest of it is going to be 
about.” 
In Nina Boyle’s “What Became of Mr. Des- 
mond ” (Seltzer) a mild man walks out to get nails 
to finish hanging a picture and stays fifteen years. 
When he walks back there is such a look in his eye 
that no one dares ask where he has been; the rest of 
the book tells how he got the look. In Lee Thayer’s 
“The Sinister Mark” (Doubleday, Page) an actress 
makes an extremely ingenious disappearance. “The 
Lost Mr. Linthwaite” (Knopf) is one of the best of 
the long line of J. S. Fletcher’s exciting detective com- 
plications; he has another disappearance in “ Scar- 
haven Keep” (Knopf). Mrs. Belloc Lowndes finds 
her mysteries in the dark corners of human nature; 
that is why her shivers go deeper. In her “ The End 
of the Honeymoon” (Scribner) a bridal couple stop 
at a lonely inn and are assigned to rooms widely 
separated ; in the morning the bridegroom is gone and 
the inn-people insist that the girl had come there quite 
alone. Speaking of Mrs. Belloc Lowndes, I make an 
exception in her case to my not remembering detective 
stories: I could not forget her masterpiece of terror, 
“The Lodger ” (Scribner), if I tried. 
In George Birmingham’s “The Search Party” 
(Doran) men vanish one by one with the men sent to 
find them, but in Eden Phillpotts’s “The Red Red- 
maynes ” (Macmillan) they stay vanished, for they 
have been picked off one by one by an attractive pair
-P-A-G-E-90
  80 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
of murderers. ‘Lord Brackenbery,” by Amelia B. 
Edwards, and “ The Lost Sir Massingberd,” by James 
Payn, are two of the older disappearance novels; 
Richard Washburn Child’s “The Vanishing Men” 
(Dutton), a mysterious newer one. Anna Katherine 
Green can deal properly with disappearances; she has 
one in “ Room No. 3” (Dodd, Mead) and long ago 
I took a novel of hers to a New Hampshire village and 
it was read to rags by borrowers from miles around; 
the name was “ Lost Man’s Lane,” from a short road 
that a succession of men entered and never came out 
from. 
“The Murder of Edwin Drood,” by Percy Carden 
(Cecil Palmer, London), came to my hand a year or 
so ago, and is, I think, the latest of the many books 
that have searched the matter. Alas, it kills Edwin 
for me. All these years I have numbered him only 
among the missing, and it hurts to have to move him 
over into another column of the casualties. This small 
book does not try to reason out what the characters 
in the story would have done had they been real 
people, but tries to fathom instead what the mind of 
Dickens had most probably laid out for them to do. 
§ 18 
COLLEGE LIFE 
“What are some of the novels that deal wholly or in 
part with life in American colleges?” 
I wisu those little classics of Harvard, Charles M. 
Flandrau’s “ Diary of a Freshman ” (Appleton, 1912)
-P-A-G-E-91
  “IS THERE A NOVEL ABOUT—?” 81 
and “ Harvard Episodes ” (Copeland and Day, 1897), 
were in print, but there surely must be copies of them 
around somewhere; they were too good to lose. The 
hero of Robert Nathan’s “ Peter Kindred ” (Duffield), 
a Phillips Exeter man, goes to Harvard and marries 
a Radcliffe girl. The most widely-read Yale novel is 
Owen Johnson’s “Stover at Yale” (Little, Brown) 
which has held its own with the public for years; 
another good Yale novel is Meade Minnegerode’s 
“ The Big Year” (Putnam). Ralph D. Paine’s “ Sons 
of Eli” (Scribner) is a well-known group of short 
stories; another of his is ‘“‘ College Years ” (Scribner). 
Stephen Vincent Benét’s “‘ The Beginning of Wisdom ” 
(Holt) has admirable chapters laid at Yale; this book 
has the true sense of youth. 
Scott Fitzgerald’s “ This Side of Paradise ” (Scrib- 
ner) carries Princeton away up on this list in numbers 
of readers — whether this pleases Princeton or not is 
another matter. Wadsworth Camp’s “ The Guarded 
Heights ” (Doubleday, Page) has the round of every- 
day life at Princeton and a football match breaking 
through. Owen Wister’s “ Philosophy 4” (Macmil- 
lan) is already, and well deserves to be, a stand-by in 
college fiction; I don’t know a funnier or a more 
truthful description of how some students get by. 
Wilmarth Lewis’s “ Tutor’s Lane” (Knopf) is a de- 
mure and sparkling little novel about a little college 
in New England, with a pleasant Bensonian taste. 
Charles Norris’s “Salt” (Dutton) includes college 
experience in its hero’s education. Booth Tarking- 
ton’s “Ramsey Milholland” (Doubleday, Page) 
goes to a State University, but the war does not
-P-A-G-E-92
  
  82 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
leave him there long. George Fitch’s “At Good 
Old Siwash” (Little, Brown) is not only a. good 
account of co-educational college life in the Middle 
West, but one of the funniest of college books. 
Earl Silvers is midway of a series for boys, begin- 
ning with “Ned Beals, Freshman” (Appleton) 
concerned largely with the attitude of the resident 
to the “commuter.” Dorothy Canfield’s excel- 
lent novel “ The Bent Twig ” (Holt) is about a State 
University not named but locally believed to be in 
Ohio. The State U. is being “shown up from the in- 
side” by young people just now; the most savage of 
these novels is “The Barb,” by William McNally 
(Putnam), who weakens his case by making his barb 
also an unmitigated pup. “Town and Gown,” by 
Lynn and Lois Montross (Doran), is a collection of 
short stories or little novels by a pair who will go far 
if they keep on at this rate. One who can tell as much 
truth about elemental humanity in as few words as in 
the one called “Girls Who Pet” has powers worth 
developing. 
There is all the difference in the world between an 
American “ college novel ” and one by an Englishman 
about university life. The latter takes it for granted 
as one of the cogs in the cosmos and rarely tries to 
tinker with the machinery. Beverley Nichols’s young 
hero does try to restore a lost vivacity to life in 
Oxford in _“ Patchwork” but this was just after 
the war, when everyone was trying to brighten the 
corner where he was. Stephen Leacock’s “ College 
Days ” (Dodd, Mead) is by a Canadian, but the book 
will do for either side of the line. The American col- 
lege novel is almost always frankly critical, either of
-P-A-G-E-93
“IS THERE A NOVEL ABOUT—?” 83 
some specified feature of the life or with a vague sense 
of general maladjustment. You can find few, for in- 
stance, that you would send to a foreigner as an in- 
ducement to come over for four years and study — 
unless it were a foreign young lady, for novels about 
American colleges for women are far more friendly. 
Jean Webster’s “When Patty Went to College” and 
“ Daddy-Long-Legs ” (Century) might easily direct a 
girl to Vassar, Josephine Daskam Bacon’s “Smith 
College Stories ” (Scribner) are kindly enough, and so 
is Abbie Carter Goodloe’s “ College Girl’s ” (Scribner). 
But if these new State U. revelations keep up much 
longer — and stronger — they may head the Ku Klux 
their way. You can’t call life in a State University a 
“ hectic sex swirl” and not be prepared to start some- 
thing. 
Just as the lists are closing come two new ones, 
Percy Marks’s “The Plastic Age” (Century) which 
tells what college life may be in a number of aspects, 
described with a vivacity and verisimilitude that will 
ensure young people’s reading it, and “ The Educa- 
tion of Peter,” by John Wiley (Stokes) a report from 
a recent graduate of Yale. 
§ 19 
LAWYERS 
What novels concern the law, lawyers, causes célé- 
bres, and vexed legal problems involving human 
rights? 
ArtHur Tran has made this his province in late 
years, and his legal novels and stories, “ By Advice of
-P-A-G-E-94
84 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
Counsel,” “Tutt and Mr. Tutt,” “The Hermit of 
Turkey Hollow,” “ The Confessions of Artemas Quib- 
ble,” “ The Prisoner at the Bar” (Scribner), are not 
only sound law — Mr. Train was Assistant District 
Attorney from 1901 to 1908 — but absorbing reading 
for one who, like me, has nothing like a legal mind. 
Frederick Trevor Hill wrote “Tales out of Court” 
(Stokes), sixteen stories involving legal cases and un- 
usual incidents, and followed it with “ The Thirteenth 
Juror” (Century). A Philadelphia lawyer, Sydney 
Nyburg, author of a strong novel of Jewish life, “ The 
Chosen People,” wrote “ The Final Verdict ” (Lippin- 
cott), six stories of court-room experiences. 
“The People Against Nancy Preston,” by John 
Moroso (Holt), involves a tragic miscarriage of jus- 
tice. “The Jugglers,” by Ezra Selig Brudno (Mof- 
fatt) and “ Rope,” by Holworthy Hall (Dodd), have 
legal complications. Politics and law are mingled in 
Arthur Bullard’s New York story “ A Man’s World” 
(Macmillan), and a good many of the books named in 
the list of American “ political novels” would qualify 
here too. The latest political novel, Herbert Quick’s 
“The Hawkeye” (Bobbs), pauses in its stride long 
enough to let the hero, trying to study law, free his 
mind about some of the complexities of Blackstone. 
Many divorce novels might be included ; for instance, 
W. B. Maxwell’s “ For Better, for Worse” (Dodd, 
Mead), a striking presentation of the injustices of 
English divorce law. These are often under fire in 
the novels of Galsworthy, while if plays were in ques- 
tion his “ Justice ” and “ Loyalties ” (Scribner) would 
be included. The “ deceased wife’s sister” novels are  
-P-A-G-E-95

now out of date, but Eden Phillpotts’s “The Green 
Alleys” (Macmillan) is a passionately sympathetic 
statement of the wrongs of the natural child, in which 
one of the characters carries on a correspondence with 
his bishop over the status of the nullius filius. 
Of the Victorians Dickens, whose “ Bleak House ” 
put the word Jarndyce into law-language, had the 
greatest number of lawyers. They range from the 
_ vampires Vholes and Heep past windy Buzfuz and 
- dubious Jaggers, to airy Lightwood, cheerful Perker 
and Grewgius the guardian angel. Bulwer Lytton’s 
“What Will He do With It?” has “a charioteer to 
whom an experience of British law suggests an in- 
genious mode of arresting the Roman papacy ” — that 
is, get the Pope into Chancery and he’ll never get out. 
All three scenes of Barrie’s play “The Will” take 
place in a lawyer’s office. 
Of French novelists Balzac dealt with the law most 
often, personally as well as in his fiction, and his list 
of lawyers is as long and as various as that of Dickens. 
John Marshall Gest, in an article in the American 
Law Review, New York, 1913, writes at some length 
about “The Law and Lawyers of Balzac.” Brieux’s 
“The Red Robe,” translated in the volume with 
“Woman on her Own ” (Brentano), is an arraignment 
of certain features of contemporary French legal pro- 
cedure. “What the Judge Thought ” by Judge Ed- 
ward Abbot Parry (Knopf), is sparkling philosophy 
in essay form. This list does not include novels in 
which a scene in court is introduced as incident or 
climax in a detective story.

“THE ADVERTISING GAME” 
“TI am at present studying the subject of advertising 
from the usual text books, but it has occurred to 
me that the sidelights thrown upon it by contempo- 
rary fiction would be illuminating.” 
Naruratty I think first of George F. Babbitt, for 
he nearly sold me a house. That is, when I was read- 
ing “ Babbitt ” (Harcourt) for the first time and came 
upon his bargain list of small suburban properties I 
felt that curious surge of interest that means I am 
going to make a note of those properties and look 
them over when I have time. Then I came to, and 
realized that the “cute California bungalows” were 
in every sense an ad-writer’s dream. But as my in- 
terest in real ads never gets me further than this 
preliminary surge, Babbitt was doing as well as other 
realtors. From these pages one may learn also the 
impassioned appeal to tobacco users, the correspond- 
ence school’s siren song, the indirect approach of the 
ambitious parson, even the coo of the cemetery coaxer. 
Una Golden, in Mr. Lewis’s earlier novel “ The Job” 
(Harcourt), is in love with the publicity man in her 
first office, and when she has an office of her own, 
years after, she has him first for publicity man and 
then for consort. Stephen Leacock has a sweet con- 
tribution to the literature of pep in “ Over the Foot- 
lights ” (Dodd, Mead) ; a man explains “ how I made 
good in business ” and at last I have found something 
funnier than genuine magazine articles of this nature.
-P-A-G-E-97
  “IS THERE A NOVEL ABOUT—?” 87 
Maurice Samuel’s “ Whatever Gods ” (Duffield) opens 
with a family conclave in which a shoe manufacturer 
plans an advertising campaign; I don’t know when I 
have read a more lifelike scene of household exaspera- 
tions, of positions mutually incomprehensible, or a 
better statement of the demands of idealistic youth. 
One of the best “ advertising novels” from England 
is J. D. Beresford’s “A Candidate for Truth” 
(Doran). The American in it who comes over to con- 
quer the old country is an “ evolutionary advertising 
agent ” who puts into the British scheme of things 
“a really capable service with black-and-white artists 
on the premises and writers of brisk, snappy copy; 
Mr. Hill would supply the ideas. He had hundreds of 
ideas, all fresh from the States.” 
Robert Simon’s “ Our Little Girl” (Boni) explains 
musical advertising —some of it. The rest remains 
for some brave soul to tell. Emma McChesney’s son 
Jock has adventures in the advertising business in 
“ Personality Plus” (Stokes). There is a play, “It 
Pays to Advertise,” by Megrue and Hackett (French). 
In Leroy Scott’s novel of blackmail in polite society, 
“Cordelia the Magnificent” (Holt), a young lady 
gets into a fine mess through a want ad. The medi- 
cine man in “ Tono-Bungay ” knew the technique of 
advertising; so did the husband in “ The Wife of Sir 
Isaac Harman” (Macmillan), even if he did put his 
signboards in the wrong places to please the more 
tender eye of his wife. W. L. George’s “Caliban” 
(Harper) reaches its high point when the man who 
controls mass publicity falls in love with an author 
whose idea of failure is to have pleased the million.  
-P-A-G-E-98
  88 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
Just in time for inclusion upon this list come three 
of the most important entries. John Owen’s “ The 
Hoarding ” (Dutton) is the story of a young adver- 
tising agent, and the background is that of the 
business; the word, Britons would have us know, is 
the one they use where we say “billboard.” The 
novel that is my own choice as the best English novel 
for a year, and surely one of the most comfortable, 
Frank Swinnerton’s “ Young Felix” (Doran), affords 
in an advertising office the means whereby its hero 
keeps the butcher at bay while he is learning to paint 
pictures. And though “You Too” by Ralph Bur- 
lingame (Scribner) may not send many young men 
into the advertising profession, it is mighty good 
reading, in or out of it.

SIDELIGHTS ON POLITICS 
A college department of history asks for suggestions 
on novels to add to its collection dealing with the 
political life of America. 
Amonc the reasons why one should read Herbert 
Quick’s “ The Hawkeye ” (Bobbs), the one that makes 
me use it to begin this list is that it’ is an inside study 
of county politics and the system that makes them 
what they are. What happens in Iowa in the seven- 
ties, here set down with understanding and sympathy, 
shows the reader in any part of our country why 
machines have a way of continuing to function after 
they are smashed, and how honest men may, upon 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
  “IS THERE A NOVEL ABOUT—?” 89 
occasion, be elected to dishonesty. James L. Ford’s 
“Hot Corn Ike” (Dutton) is drawn from the rich 
store of personal experience indicated in his “ Forty- 
Odd Years in the Newspaper Shop ” (Dutton) ; it is 
about Coney Island when it was a winter refuge for 
pensioned-off political retainers, and loses interest only 
when the author remembers, as he unfortunately does 
every now and then, that he is writing a novel. In 
“One Man in his Time” (Doubleday, Page) Ellen 
Glasgow returns to Virginian politics, a subject with 
which her earlier novels had proved her equipped to 
deal. “ Capitol Hill,” by Harvey Fergusson (Knopf), 
is a recent, misanthropic study of Washington, D. C. 
“ A Man of Purpose,” by Donald Richberg (Crowell), 
is about midwestern conditions. Julia Houston 
Railey’s “Show Down” (Putnam) brings a college 
girl home to a Southern town and mixes her first in 
local and then in state politics. “The Little Back 
Room,” by Edward S. Chamberlayn (Stokes), is about 
the protégé of a small-town boss. “The Band 
Wagon,” by Franklin Ellsworth (Dorrance), goes after 
the machine in Minnesota. “ Rekindled Fires,” by 
Joseph Anthony (Holt), is an excellent novel for the 
study of national patriotism transferred to this coun- 
try; the real hero is an old Czech who has become the 
local boss of a small New Jersey community, and the 
political conferences in it are as if one listened in on 
them. 
Of the older novels, Arthur Bullard’s “A Man’s 
World” (Macmillan) is a disillusioned but by no 
means disheartened study of New York politics. 
“The Bishop of Cottontown,” by J. T. Moore (Win- 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
  90 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
ston), deals with child labor in Alabama. A list of 
this sort must include Albion Tourgée’s first-hand 
studies of the original Ku Klux in “ Bricks Without 
Straw,” “A Fool’s Errand,” and “The Invisible Em- 
pire,” even if they are out of print; it must have 
Henry Adams’s “ Democracy,” Winston Churchill’s 
“Coniston” and “ Mr. Crewe’s Career ” (Macmillan), 
Booth Tarkington’s “A Gentleman from Indiana” 
and “In the Arena” (Doubleday, Page), and Paul 
Leicester Ford’s “ Honorable Peter Sterling ” (Holt). 
There is another novel based on the career of Cleve- 
land, “ Crowded out of Crowfield ” (Appleton), which 
W. O. Stoddard made from Cleveland’s own story of 
his early life. Octave Thanet’s “ Expiation ” (Scrib- 
ner) is in Arkansas after the war. 
The politics of Alexander Hamilton figure in Ger- 
trude Atherton’s “The Conqueror” (Stokes), and 
those of the Lincoln-Douglas period in Edgar Lee 
Masters’s “ Children of the Market Place” (Macmil- 
lan). To rush through the names of some of the 
novels in which our politics have been the subject of 
illumination or discussion, there are Hamlin Garland’s 
“ A Spoil of Office,” Francis Lynde’s “ The Grafters,” 
Gertrude Atherton’s “Senator North,” Will Payne’s 
“Money Captain,” David Graham Phillips’s “ Light 
Fingered Gentry,” P. V. Mighels’s “The Ultimate 
Passion,” J. A. Altsheler’s “Guthrie of the Times,” 
and W. M. Mills’s “ The Man Higher Up.” 
Here are some of the books about famous American 
politicians by themselves or others, that the depart- 
ment has gathered for this study: Martin Van Buren’s 
“ Autobiography”; “ Alexander Hamilton,” by F. S. 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
  
“IS THERE A NOVEL ABOUT—?” 91 
Oliver; Herbert Croly’s “ Marcus Alonzo Hanna”; 
the “ Autobiography ” of Theodore Roosevelt; “ Al- 
bert Gallatin,” by Henry Adams; the “ Autobiog- 
raphy ” of Thomas C. Platt; S. W. McCall’s “ Thomas 
B. Reed”; W. O. Foulke’s “A Hoosier Autobiog- 
raphy”; Brand Whitlock’s “Forty Years of It”; 
Tom Lindsay’s “ My Own Story”; Lincoln Steffens’s 
“Shame of the Cities” and “The Struggle for Self 
Government ”; “ Chapters in Erie,” by C. F. Adams, 
Jr.; “Mirrors of Washington” (Putnam) and E. G. 
Lowry’s “Washington Close-ups” (Houghton) ; 
Oscar Straus’s “Under Four Administrations ” 
(Houghton); Franklin Lane’s “Letters” (Hough- 
ton), and the “Life and Letters of Walter Hines 
Page” (Doubleday, Page). 
Of the more important recent autobiographies and 
books on political personages, Mrs. Borden Harri- 
man’s “ From Pinafores to Politics” (Holt) has the 
most charm, and a wide range. Solomon B. Griffin’s 
“ People and Politics ” (Little) is from the experience 
of the managing editor of the Springfield Republican. 
“A Life of Francis Amasa Walker,” by James Phin- 
ney Munroe (Holt), is an account of his richly va- 
ried life as statistician, economist, and educator, en- 
twined with political activities from the Civil War to 
1897. “Four Famous New Yorkers,” by DeAlva 
Stanwood Alexander (Holt), is a continuation of his 
standard “ Political History of the State of New 
York ”; it presents the political careers of Cleveland, 
Platt, Hill, and Roosevelt. There is a new life of 
“Grover Cleveland” by Robert McElroy (Harper). 
The second volume of “ A History of the United States
-P-A-G-E-102
  92 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
Since the Civil War,” by Ellis Paxson Oberholtzer 
(Macmillan), carries the tale to 1872 and by its pic- 
tures of post-war conditions links those days with 
today in a somewhat disconcerting fashion. “The 
Great Game of Politics,” by Frank R. Kent (Double- 
day), is a newspaperman’s story of how this national 
pastime is carried on in cities, counties, states and 
Washington. 
“The American Party System,” by Charles E. Mer- 
riam (Macmillan), is a recent text book that will serve 
also the needs of the general reader, “ Parties and 
Party Leaders,’ by Anson Morse (Marshall Jones), 
is another new study, and “ The Boy’s Own Book of 
Politics,” by William Shepherd (Macmillan), for the 
younger reader.

KEEPING UP WITH FICTION 
A reader who graduated seven years ago from High 
School is “a bit discouraged when I look back and 
realize to how inconsiderable a degree I have im- 
proved my mind since then: although I have at- 
tempted to keep up with the modern fiction output, 
the scope of my reading has been greatly limited 
and unsystematic.” 
Ir may seem like shaking off a responsibility to 
suggest one book instead of the selected reading list 
that this inquirer has in mind, but when I can shake 
it on to such a capable book as Prof. J. W. Cunliffe’s 
“English Literature During the Last Half Century ” 
(Macmillan) it were folly not to do so. This manual,
-P-A-G-E-103
  
“IS THERE A NOVEL ABOUT—?” 93 
which is as good for home reading as it would be for 
class study, fills in the gap between many of the 
standard text-books and the books of the day and hour 
—that is, it goes from Hardy and Stevenson through 
Wells, Galsworthy, Conrad and the rest of the “ new ” 
poets and novelists. 
The plan is for each a brief critical sketch and a 
bibliography. Its usefulness will to a great measure 
depend upon the thoroughness with which one who 
reads it will go on to read all the books it mentions 
in these criticisms. Its best quality is that it arouses 
the desire to go on with this reading. 
It would lighten this reader’s discouragement to 
know how many of us have a sinking feeling when 
we remember how much we knew when we graduated 
from High School. It is something awful how much 
less geometry I know now than I did then, and my 
Greek has practically disappeared. 
§ 23 
HISTORICAL NOVELS 
“Do historians regard fiction labelled historical as 
beneath their notice? I am looking for an historical 
bibliography of fiction. Some time ago I was re- 
ferred to Baker’s ‘ Guide to Historical Fiction’ but 
found it was like trying to select a list of friends 
from a city directory. What I want is a list of 
twenty or more novels that successfully dramatize 
historic periods or persons, or both, without doing 
too much violence to the facts. I should prefer 
standard books but not necessarily old ones.”
-P-A-G-E-104
  
94 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
Tue ideal historical novel would be one in which 
all the history was set down as it happened, all the 
details of costume, speech and the like were accurate, 
and the general spiritual atmosphere that of a par- 
ticular time and place—in other words, a book to 
set the reader down in the life of another day and 
keep him fascinated by it. “The Cloister and the 
Hearth” seems to me to come the nearest to these 
specifications of any novel written in English, “ Lorna 
Doone” coming! close to it, and “ Henry Esmond ” 
crowding them both. Naomi Mitchison’s novel of 
Caesar’s day, “ The Conquered ” (Harcourt), is a new 
arrival in this class. All these introduce historical 
personages but do not use them for the central char- 
acters. The novelist who does this runs in direct 
competition with history, which after all was on the 
ground first. 
“ Andivius Hedulio,” by Edward Lucas White 
(Dutton), seems to me a more convincing record of 
Imperial Rome than Sienkiewicz’s “Quo Vadis?” 
(Little, Brown); Seymour Van Sandtvoord’s “ Oc- 
tavia” (Dutton) belongs to the same period, but 
Octavia is a person already in the history-books; you 
know that the honest author will have no choice in 
what he makes her do. But Andivius Hedulio himself 
is the creation of free fancy working within the bounds 
of a large knowledge of a high-strung and precarious 
period; he who never lived helps to keep the time of 
Commodus alive. “Octavia” covers so much time 
—three reigns — that it is in effect a series of ex- 
citing scenes — Saturnalian festivals, races, and royal
-P-A-G-E-105
“IS THERE A NOVEL ABOUT—?” 95 
assassinations — held together by pages like the 
“what has gone before” of a magazine serial. 
All novels of the French Revolution keep you read- 
ing, just as no play about it has been quite dull, but 
Anatole France’s “The Gods Are Athirst ” (Dodd) 
is marvelous. I am a devotee of Dickens but I can’t 
keep my face straight over “ A Tale of Two Cities ”; 
now in “ Barnaby Rudge” he knows what he is talk- 
ing about, and in a series of mighty chapters the 
Gordon Riots flame back out of history. “ Henry 
Esmond” for the Age of Anne, “ Micah Clarke” for 
Monmouth’s Rebellion, “ Three Musketeers” for a 
good time. When I was a little girl I read the “ Ro- 
mance of Old Court Life in France,” by Frances 
Elliot (Putnam), in old back-numbers of Appleton’s 
Journal, and to this day I know the succession of 
French kings for four reigns back of Henri Quatre. 
I shiver when I think that I only just escaped the 
standard historical romancer for young girls in those 
days, who was Louisa Miihlbach— only one Miihl- 
bach I read, and it took me years to get back into 
a reasonable state of mind about the Empress Jose- 
phine. 
I wonder what the effect would be to take a young 
person straight from Miihlbach’s mild domestic martyr 
to the lady who figures in Leonie Aminoff’s “ Torch- 
light ” series of novels about Napoleon (Dutton). 
This is the only woman writer of historical fiction I 
know who has the spirit and something of the methods 
of the elder Dumas. Where or how she gets her facts 
I do not know, but out of whatever it was she has 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  96 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
made a little world peopled with little men and women 
with great names; and they live, whether their own 
lives over again or a different existence that she has 
made for them I do not greatly care. The titles so 
far are “Revolution,” “Love,” and “ Ambition.” 
Sabatini always makes his people live: the success 
of “ Scaramouche ” and “ Captain Blood ” is bringing 
back into print all the others. 
My own preference in American historical fiction is 
rather for novels that evoke a state of mind prevail- 
ing at a particular period than those from which I 
could learn what I could learn more swiftly from a 
good school-history. “The Scarlet Letter,” for in- 
stance, or William Dean Howells’s “ The Leatherwood 
God,” a book that should be oftener read than it 
is, and known to more readers. I am especially 
happy with the new type of novel coming from history 
just before or even after the Civil War — Herbert 
Quick’s “ Vandemark’s Folly ” and “ The Hawkeye ” 
(Bobbs), whose fidelity to detail is such that if we 
could have twenty like them for as many periods we 
would not need the “ Chronicles of America,” Emer- 
son Hough’s “ The Covered Wagon” and “ North of 
36” (Appleton) with those vast and unforgettable 
migrations in which one feels history moving with the 
herds and the caravans, and now the delicate love- 
liness of Willa Cather’s “A Lost Lady” (Knopf) 
whose deathless heroine stands out against a period 
whose history has hardly cooled off yet. 
No one really gets the good of an historical novel 
who is not led thereby to read history. One would 
think that fifteen-year-olds would be gorged on “ The 
 
-P-A-G-E-107
“TIS THERE A NOVEL ABOUT—?” 97 
Three Musketeers ” and “Twenty Years After.” As 
a matter of fact, these immortal romances only whet 
their appetites. They go down the line of sequels 
until they find their way blocked by no more trans- 
lations. In that case, with the fate of Fouquet hang- 
ing in the balance, it dawned upon me with a thrill 
of rapture that Fouquet was in the history. It was 
like finding that a plain and unpromising box has 
chocolates in it. I have been fishing chocolates out 
of the history box ever since. 
Indeed, I wonder more novelists do not discover 
what bon-bons there are in memoirs. Mrs. Humphrey 
Ward realized that when she found “Lady Rose’s 
Daughter ” and a long line of later romances in letters 
and biography. Perhaps they are deterred by finding 
the originals so much less credible than the characters 
she makes out of them: Lady Caroline Lamb, for 
instance, is so much more a figure of pure fiction in 
her own letters and in the Byron-Melbourne corre- 
spondence than in “ The Marriage of William Ashe.” 
The only novel I ever read that made Byron at all 
like the man who wrote his letters is Maurice Hew- 
lett’s “ Bendish.” As Pirandello says in the preface 
to the English translation of his novel “The Late 
Mattia Pascal” (Dutton), “ Life, despite its brazen 
absurdities, little or big, has the invaluable privilege 
of dispensing with that idiotic verisimilitude to which 
Art believes itself in duty bound to defer.” That 
sober historical chronicle, “The Chevalier de Bouf- 
flers”” by Nesta Webster (Dutton), surpasses most of 
the novels of the old régime in France in just the 
qualities that fiction alone is supposed to possess. “A
-P-A-G-E-108
    98 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
man who keeps his sweetheart waiting twenty years 
and then writes, “ Come quickly then, little lazy one, 
so that I may marry you, for this ought to have been 
done long ago”; his mother, twice a duchess, pat- 
ronizing society in her old age from cushions stuffed 
with her own wild oats — oh, in a novel people would 
never believe it. 
Between novel and biography stands the line of 
“ portraits ” by Gamaliel Bradford, of which the latest 
is that group of dubious reputations framed in 
“ Damaged Souls” (Houghton). They are like meet- 
ing people without either haloes or hoofs, real people 
faithfully introduced.

HISTORICAL NOVELS FOR YOUNG 
PEOPLE 
“What historical novels will hold the attention of a 
group of High School students and be of value to 
them in their study?” 
By that age almost any historical novel worth read- 
ing at all will be of some value to them, and by look- 
ing through Baker’s “Guide to Historical Fiction,” 
which is arranged by countries and in chronological 
order, you will find the less recent, standard novels 
that fit into your history course, “The Cloister and 
the Hearth,” “ Romola,” and the rest. As no one with 
a sense of responsibility puts a book into a school 
library without reading it first, tales that seem a trifle 
fervent for a co-educational collection can easily be 
left for shelves with no age-limit. But before the  
-P-A-G-E-109
  
“IS THERE A NOVEL ABOUT—?” 99 
school-library censor shuts out a novel of merit be- 
cause he thinks the pupils are not old enough to read 
it, let him reflect that as most of us get most of our 
reading over and done with before we are twenty, he 
is shutting it out for good, in the case of many of his 
charges. 
The recent strong and steadily strengthening in- 
terest in historical fiction — strongest in America for 
American history, but showing in other countries and 
for other times — has brought out not only a number 
of admirable romances intended for the general public, 
but along with them not a few meant especially for 
somewhat younger readers. Beginning as nearly at 
the beginning as fiction has begun, C. D. Roberts’s 
“Tn the Morning of Time” (Stokes) and Irving 
Crump’s “ Og, the Son of Fire” (Dodd, Mead) come 
to reinforce the established prehistorics, Stanley 
Waterloo’s “Story of Ab” (Doubleday, Page) and 
Jack London’s “ Before Adam” (Macmillan). All 
the old lists used to put on Georg Ebers’s “ Egyptian 
Princess ” and “ Uarda,” and not only “Ben Hur” 
but “The Prince of India,” but any class that can 
visit the Metropolitan Museum or any other Egyptian 
room in a museum can get the same amount of 
Egyptology with far less gristle. Indeed, they get 
it with ease and delight in the pages of “ Wonders 
of the Past” (Putnam), an enthralling picture-book. 
As for Lew Wallace’s romances, even as a young per- 
son they wore me out. There is a picture of Rome 
and the life of the early Christians in Anne Allinson’s 
“Children of the Way” (Harcourt, Brace), faithful 
in detail—the author is a classical scholar — and
-P-A-G-E-110
  100 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
showing without preaching the clear spirit of the 
new faith in the twilight of the gods. Most novels 
of classic Rome are too accurate in their descriptions 
of imperial petting parties to qualify for this list, but 
Edward Lucas White’s “ Andivius Hedulio ” (Dutton) 
could certainly be admitted. I remember that when 
I was reading Caesar we could never lay hand upon 
collateral reading for the Gallic Wars and though 
since then we have had Shaw’s “Caesar and Cleo- 
patra,” which I will back against history any day, 
it was not until this year that the Gauls, in Naomi 
Mitchison’s “ The Conquered ” (Harcourt), had their 
side of it in fiction form. “The Perilous Seat,” by 
Caroline Snedeker, author of “ The Spartan,” is, like 
that novel, reliable as well as readable (Doubleday, 
Page). 
“The Hunchback of Notre Dame ” on the screen is 
bringing back the book, so they say; “ Scaramouche” 
on screen and stage reminded the people who had not 
read it what a good story they missed. All of Sa- 
batini’s novels — “ Captain Blood,” “‘ The Sea Hawk,” 
“ Fortune’s Fool ” and the rest — belong to the small 
but valuable group of historical novels that are read 
by young or old with equal happiness because older 
people become temporarily young while reading them. 
By quite different methods “ Lorna Doone” qualifies 
for this group, and of course the “‘ Three Musketeers ” 
series. If there really must be an expurgated “ Three 
Musketeers” for quite young readers the Milton 
Bradley edition has slipped out all the parts that 
might displease a conscientious adult, and I am bound 
to say has done it so deftly you would not know any-

  “TS THERE A NOVEL ABOUT—?” 101 
thing had happened unless you had read the real one 
first. 
The school library, which must look out for the 
needs of younger readers along with those of the 
almost-grown-ups, will have the standbys like Eva 
March Tappan’s “When Knights Were Bold” 
(Houghton, Mifflin) and “In the Days of Alfred the 
Great ” (Lothrop), Mark Twain’s “ Prince and the 
Pauper” and “Yankee at King Arthur’s Court” 
(Harper), Wilmot-Buxton’s “ Jeanne d’Arc ” (Stokes) 
or the new “ Saint Jeanne d’Arc ” by Minna C. Smith 
(Macmillan); A. H. Seaman’s “Jacqueline of the 
Carrier Pigeons” (Macmillan), about the siege of 
Leyden, the edition of Jane Porter’s “ Scottish Chiefs ” 
with Wyeth’s color plates (Scribner), Masefield’s 
“ Jim Davis” (Grosset) and “ Martin Hyde” (Little, 
Brown), Kipling’s “ Puck of Pook’s Hill” and “ Re- 
wards and Fairies” (Doubleday), Kingsley’s “ Here- 
ward the Wake,” Stevenson’s “The Black Arrow” 
(Scribner) and John Bennett’s “ Master Skylark ” 
(Century). Charlotte M. Yonge is coming back into 
circulation at a surprising rate: Duffield has brought 
out a new edition of “The Little Duke” with col- 
ored pictures, and Macmillan is republishing several 
others including the one that introduces Mary Queen 
of Scots, ‘“‘ Unknown to History.” A new edition of 
Herbert Harrison’s “ A Lad of Kent” (Macmillan) is 
out; it is a smuggling story of the time of George III. 
Daniel Henderson’s “Pirate Princes and Yankee 
Jacks” (Dutton) is straight history in fiction form, 
about the time of Decatur. “The Fortunes of Garin,” 
by Mary Johnston (Houghton, Mifflin), begin in 1035;

it is an excellent story for romantic young girls, and 
so is Mary Hartwell Catherwood’s “ Story of Tonty ” 
(McClurg). Bernard Marshall has followed his boys’ 
story “ Cedric the Forester ” with another romance of 
Plantagenet times, “ Walter of Tiverton ” (Appleton). 
In John Buchan’s “ The Path of the King ” (Doran) 
a high type of character appears at various periods of 
history, culminating in Lincoln. We have a number 
of good stories of American history introducing chil- 
dren, or young people, Elsie Singmaster’s “ Emmeline ” 
(Houghton) for instance, Thomas Nelson Page’s 
“Two Little Confederates” (Scribner), the “Cardi- 
gan” series of Robert Chambers, and the series of 
veracious romances showing the historical background 
of Princeton, by Paul Tomlinson (Dodd, Mead), be- 
ginning with “ A Princeton Boy Under the King” and 
continuing through the Revolution. Mary Johnston’s 
“1492” (Little, Brown) is read with enthusiasm by 
young people; in general her historical romances 
appeal to them, at least they certainly do to all I 
have tried them on. 
I am taking it for granted that this library has 
already a good collection of those hero-tales —like 
Howard Pyle’s, or H. W. Lanier’s “ Book of Giants ” 
(Dutton) or Eleanor Hull’s “ The Boy’s Cuchulain ” 
(Crowell) — that slide the younger reader over from 
mythology into history. Every teacher should know, 
and no doubt they do, that in the appendix of Henrik 
Van Loon’s “Story of Mankind” (Boni and 
Liveright) is one of the best historical reading-lists 
for children that one could wish, made by Leonora 
St. John Power of the New York Public Library, and
-P-A-G-E-113
  
  “IS THERE A NOVEL ABOUT—?” 103 
so well annotated that parent or child could choose 
from it. She made the one in his “Story of the 
Bible” (Boni and Liveright) also. Also a child’s 
library should own every book of re-told tales that 
Padraic Colum has made, from “The Children’s 
Homer” down the line, and this goes for a home 
library as well as for a school collection. 
Coming back to high school reading, but by another 
road, let me remind teachers of English in High 
Schools that Carl Van Doren’s pamphlet, “ Contem- 
porary Fiction and the High School Teacher of Eng- 
lish,” has been reprinted and may be had from the 
English Teachers Association, 60 West 13th street, 
New York, for ten cents. Hundreds of teachers of 
English are anxious for guidance in this perplexing 
field, and here it is.

AMERICAN HISTORY IN FICTION 
“What historical novels would cover our national 
history?” 
Mary Jounston begins it at the beginning, with 
her romance “ 1492 ” (Little, Brown), a story of the 
voyage told in the first person by one of the party. 
Some of our most popular historical novels belong to 
the pre-Revolutionary period: Mary Johnston’s “To 
Have and to Hold” and “ Prisoners of Hope” 
(Houghton), and a new one, “ Croatan,” whose heroine 
is Virginia Dare (Little, Brown) ; Hawthorne’s “ Scar- 
let Letter”; “Agnes Surriage,’ by E. L. Bynner 
(Houghton), which John Fiske called “one of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  104 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
greatest of American historical novels”; Emerson 
Hough’s “The Mississippi Bubble” (Bobbs), the 
story of John Law, including his adventures among 
the Indians of New France. Two favorite novels are 
about pre-Revolutionary Canada, Gilbert Parker’s 
“Seats of the Mighty” (Appleton) and Mary Hart- 
well Catherwood’s “Romance of Dollard” (Cen- 
tury). Robert Chambers’s series from “ Cardigan” 
(Harper) to “The Little Red Foot” (Doran), go 
through and past the Revolution. Francis Lynde has 
a new one about “ Mr. Arnold” (Bobbs) whose first 
name is Benedict. This period inspired some of our 
most popular romances, Paul Leicester Ford’s “ Janice 
Meredith” (Dodd, Mead), Churchill’s “ Richard 
Carvel” (Macmillan) and Weir Mitchell’s “Hugh 
Wynne, Free Quaker” (Century) with its sequel, 
“The Red City” (Century). 
Edward Everett Hale’s “ Philip Nolan’s Friends ” 
(Little, Brown) is concerned with the transfer of 
Louisiana. Gertrude Atherton’s “The Conqueror” 
(Stokes) is as nearly the life and times of Alexander 
Hamilton as fiction can go and remain fiction. Also 
when I free my mind about some of Mrs. Atherton’s 
later romances somebody always murmurs, “Oh, but 
have you read ‘The Conqueror’?” The pull of that 
book is strong enough to keep even “ Black Oxen” 
from being completely mired. 
For the South of about this time George Cable’s 
“The Grandissimes” (Scribner) and for New Eng-— 
land Mrs. Stowe’s “Oldtown Folks” (Houghton) ; 
for Indiana Edward Eggleston’s “ Roxy” and “ The 
Hoosier Schoolmaster ” (Grosset); between this and
-P-A-G-E-115
  “IS THERE A NOVEL ABOUT—?” 105 
the Civil War, Vaughan Kester’s “The Prodigal 
Judge” (Bobbs), Harry Leon Wilson’s thriller about 
pioneer Mormonism, “The Lions of the Lord” 
(Lothrop), and Hopkinson Smith’s “Fortunes of 
Oliver Horn” (Scribner). ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin” 
and Winston Churchill’s “ The Crisis” (Macmillan) 
usher in the Civil War. 
For the wartime, Mary Johnston’s “ The Long Roll ” 
and “Cease Firing” (Houghton), Stephen Crane’s 
“ Red Badge of Courage” (Appleton), and the short- 
story collection of Ambrose Bierce “In the Midst of 
Life” (Boni), especially the one called “Chicka- 
mauga ” — these for the fighting zone. For the country 
behind the lines, Ellen Glasgow’s “ The Battleground ” 
(Doubleday) and Harold Frederic’s “The Copper- 
head ” (Scribner), novels of unusual quality. For the 
reconstruction period Cable’s “John March, 
Southerner ” (Scribner), and Thomas Nelson Page’s 
“Red Rock” (Scribner). Beyond that, and coming 
to the time when history merges in the light of com- 
mon day, Winston Churchill’s “ Coniston” and “ Mr. 
Crewe’s Career” (Macmillan), William Allen White’s 
“Tn the Heart of a Fool” (Macmillan), Mrs. H. H. 
Jackson’s “ Ramona” (Little, Brown), Owen Wister’s 
“The Virginian” (Macmillan), and Mary Halleck 
Foote’s romance of reclaiming the waste lands of the 
West, “ The Chosen Valley” (Houghton). 
The great Western migrations, extending from 
before the Civil War until the closing of the last of 
the free lands, have of late years entered our fiction 
more often than any other periods in our national 
development. The sweep of Herbert Quick’s “ Vande-
-P-A-G-E-116
  
  106 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
mark’s Folly” (Bobbs) sent it up among our best 
historical fiction; it has just been followed by his 
“The Hawkeye” which begins in the Iowa of the 
fifties and lives through the career, social and politi- 
cal, of a young relative of Jake Vandemark. The 
novels of Emerson Hough are as true to native ideals 
and emotional reactions as they are to matters of his- 
torical detail; ‘The Covered Wagon” (Appleton) is 
true America and his last novel, “ North of ’36”, is 
true Texas. Hal G. Evarts’s “ Settling of the Sage ” 
(Little) is a cattle-country romance. Willa Cather’s 
“O Pioneers ” and “ My Antonia” (Houghton) made 
a place for her in the front rank of our fiction, not 
only our historical fiction; her “A Lost Lady” 
(Knopf) puts the crown upon her achievement with a 
study of one of the railroad aristocracy of the West 
when the great lines were being built across the con- 
tinent. Garet Garrett’s “The Cinder Buggy ” (Dut- 
ton) is about the struggle of iron and steel; his “ The 
Driver” in the regions of “high finance.” Stewart 
Edward White has written the story of California 
in three novels, each complete in itself, together 
covering the time and conditions of that tempera- 
mental land from 1849 through the period of the 
Vigilantes, the Eastern influx and the days of 1890. 
They are “Gold,” “The Grey Dawn” and “The 
Rose Dawn” (Doubleday). Meade Minnegerode’s 
“O Susanna!” (Putnam) is a rollicking tale of 
gold-fever days and the ships that went there. Ray 
Strachey’s “ Marching On” (Harcourt) is a novel of 
feminism before the Civil War, and the life of which 
it was a phenomenon. John MclIntyre’s “ Blowing 
 
-P-A-G-E-117
“IS THERE A NOVEL ABOUT—?” 107 
Weather ” (Century) has a wild strong flavor of its 
own; it is a story of old Philadelphia and the sea. 
The psychological values of Hergesheimer’s “The 
Three Black Pennys ” and “ Java Head ” (Knopf) are 
so high that I cannot fancy anyone reading them for 
the history alone, but one who reads them gets his- 
tory in spite of himself. Hamlin Garland’s “A Son 
of the Middle Border” and “A Daughter of the 
Middle Border” (Macmillan) are not only stranger 
than his fiction, but more like fiction, yet in “ Rose 
of Dutcher’s Coolly ” and “ Main Travelled Roads ” 
(Harper) he has enriched our middle distance with 
admirable novels. “The Pioneer West,” original nar- 
ratives gathered and made into a single vivid volume 
by Joseph Lewis French (Little, Brown), has a fore- 
word by Hamlin Garland, praising it in terms to which 
any reader interested in our epic years will agree. 
§ 26 
ENGLISH HISTORY IN FICTION 
“I want a list of historical novels that will cover 
English history from the legendary Arthur to the 
last century.” 
Kiptine’s “ Puck of Pook’s Hill” and “ Rewards 
and Fairies ” (Doubleday, Page) start this off with a 
shout. Then comes Kingsley’s “most muscular 
novel ” “ Hereward the Wake ” in Everyman’s Library, 
and right after it, in the same invaluable collection, 
Bulwer Lytton’s “ Harold: or the Last of the Saxon 
Kings,” and though this may be heavy going in places,
-P-A-G-E-118
eee eee 
108 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
| Bulwer is unusually accurate and painstaking in mat- 
ters of historic detail. Scott’s “Count Robert of 
Paris,” followed by “ The Betrothed ” and “ The Talis- 
man,” come next, and after that Hewlett’s crashing 
“Richard Yea and Nay ” (Scribner), first on this list 
in the modern manner. “Ivanhoe” next and then 
“ The Forest Lovers,” though this is a Hewlett that has 
worn thinner than the others. His ‘““ New Canterbury 
Tales” (Scribner) is supposed to be told in 1450 and 
is concerned with matters a century earlier. “ With 
the Black Prince,” by W. O. Stoddard (Appleton), is 
a juvenile so good it holds its own year after year; 
my generation learned about the battle of Crécy from 
its pages. ‘Michael Fairless,” world-famous for 
“The Roadmender,” wrote a lovely story of cloister 
life in the time of Edward III called “ The Gathering 
of Father Hilarius” (Dutton). “The Dream of John 
Ball,” by William Morris, about the time of the 
Kentish Rebellion of 1581, is published in a pocket 
edition by Longmans, Green. 
The soldiers in Conan Doyle’s “ White Company ” 
(Harper) see action in France and Castile. Hewlett’s 
“ Brazenhead the Great ” (Scribner) is in the days of 
Jack Cade’s Rebellion. You get the Wars of the 
Roses from the York side in Stevenson’s “ Black 
Arrow ” (Scribner), which comes also in a fine large 
book with Wyeth’s pictures in color. Speaking of 
getting English history from one side, I wish I could 
somehow squeeze in here the enchanting “ Love and 
Freindship,” lately discovered treasure of Jane Aus- 
ten’s youthful genius (Stokes). I can just manage to 
do so because it includes a “ History of England” by
-P-A-G-E-119
“IS THERE A NOVEL ABOUT—?” 109 
a gloriously prejudiced young historian. Also it is 
altogether delightful. Getting back to business, War- 
wick is the hero of Bulwer Lytton’s “Last of the 
Barons ” (Everyman’s). 
I would have said that I had read any number of 
novels about Henry the Eighth, but when I come to 
look them up all I can identify is “ When Knighthood 
was in Flower,” by Charles Major (Bobbs Merrill), 
whose heroine I need not introduce to movie students 
as Mary Tudor. But Edward the Sixth comes out 
strong in Mark Twain’s “The Prince and the Pauper” 
(Harper), which may have a fantastic plot but bal- 
ances this by the extraordinary vigor and sympathy 
of the scenes among the poor. Mary is in that great 
old book “The Tower of London,” by Harrison 
Ainsworth (Dutton), which is a real thriller, good for 
antiquarian details, and with the story of Lady Jane 
Grey. There is a long list of Harrison Ainsworth’s 
historical novels: someone must still love them, for 
they are published by Dutton in a beautiful illustrated 
edition. Then there is Tennyson’s play “Queen 
Mary.” Queen Elizabeth figures in Scott’s “ Kenil- 
worth ” and her reign in the time of Major’s “ Dorothy 
Vernon of Haddon Hall” (Macmillan). There is a 
beautiful new edition of Charles Kingsley’s novel of 
the sea-adventurers, “ Westward Ho! ” (Dutton) with 
colored plates and clear lovely type, and a pocket 
edition in Everyman’s. Charlotte M. Yonge’s “ Un- 
known to History ” (Macmillan) has a favorable but 
not too highly colored portrait of Mary, Queen of 
Scots. Along here comes “ Master Skylark,” by John 
Bennett (Century), the tale of a boy whom Shakes-
-P-A-G-E-120
110 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
peare befriends, beloved by generations of children, 
and William Black’s “ Judith Shakespeare ” (Harper), 
that will still exert its charm over anyone brought up 
on the plays. The best I can do for Charles I is 
“The Three Musketeers ” (Appleton) and that keeps 
for the most part on the other side of the channel. 
There is a new one for the Civil War, Elizabeth Hope’s 
“ My Lady’s Bargain” (Century), introducing Crom- 
well in person, and a new edition of Beulah Marie 
Dix’s “ Hugh Gwyeth” (Macmillan). Quiller-Couch’s 
“The Splendid Spur” (Funk and Wagnalls) comes 
in here, and J. H. Shorthouse’s “ John Inglesant,” now 
out of print. For the Commonwealth there is Scott’s 
“ Woodstock,” and one may get a good idea of the 
general state of society and especially of the Quaker 
element, from Amelia Barr’s “ Friend Olivia” (Dodd, 
Mead), while B. M. Dix’s “A Little Captive Lad ” 
(Macmillan) is dependable. 
A dashing new novel of the English restoration is 
“The Great Roxhythe,” by Georgette Heyer (Small, 
Maynard); the only other one I know is Scott’s 
“ Peveril of the Peak.” But James II has two mag- 
nificent ones, Blackmore’s “ Lorna Doone ” — which 
you may have in Everyman’s or in an illustrated edi- 
tion with photographs of the countryside (Harper) — 
and Doyle’s “ Micah Clarke” (Harper), which set 
me reading any amount of history of the period. 
William and Mary’s reign has Captain Marryat’s 
“Snarleyyow the Dog Fiend ” (Dutton) ; I have been 
meaning for years to read that, solely on account of 
its name. Mrs, Burnett’s “A Lady of Quality ” and
-P-A-G-E-121
“IS THERE A NOVEL ABOUT—?” 111 
“His Grace of Osmonde ” (Scribner) I bear in mind 
chiefly for the sang froid with which she rolled the 
corpse under the sofa. Queen Anne’s age has the 
deathless “ Henry Esmond.” The first Georges have 
“Treasure Island,” Tarkington’s “ Monsieur Beau- 
caire” (Doubleday, Page) and Charles Reade’s “ Peg 
Woffington ” (Everyman’s), and Thackeray does well 
by George the Third’s day in “ Barry Lyndon,” the 
unfinished “Denis Duval” and “ The Virginians,” at 
which point our country begins to come into the story. 
One notices in making out a list like this how many 
of the books upon it were written long ago and are 
still not only in print but well in demand. It seems 
to be worth while taking trouble to develop a gift for 
historical fiction. It is a gift that involves taking 
trouble. Seeing the confiding natures of readers of his- 
torical fiction, seeing the dependence we put on them, 
there is nothing more detestable than sham history in 
such fiction. The writer who signs E. Barrington, 
whose demure piquancy so well fits the time of which 
she writes, the eighteenth century, has a new one 
called “ The Chaste Diana ” (Dodd, Mead) that keeps 
as closely to the facts as did her previous “The 
Ladies! ” (Atlantic Monthly Press). This heroine is 
the young lady who played Polly in the original pro- 
duction of “The Beggar’s Opera.” “Cupid and Mr. 
Pepys,” by Netta Syrett (Stokes), is a pleasant new 
novel of this period. Elinor Wylie’s “ Jennifer Lorn ” 
(Doran) is a marvel of delicately adjusted erudition, 
whose detail is so perfect that it can be best appreci- 
ated by those of wide and deep reading; they will
-P-A-G-E-122
  
112 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
know how to treasure a reconstruction of the artificial 
but intense spirit of a civilization; one who likes 
Voltaire’s “ Candide ” will cherish this. 
I see that after all I have left out “the legendary 
Arthur” who was expressly stipulated. Come to 
think of it, I never read a novel about him or his 
social circle, unless you call the indispensable Sir 
Thomas Malory a novelist. It was all poetry, from 
Tennyson to “ Arthur: a Tragedy,” the new play by 
Laurence Binyon (Small, Maynard) just given in 
London. But if you once begin on folk-lore about 
him, like Rhys’s “ The Arthurian Legend,” the winding 
path leads through forests of delight.

THE MECHANICS OF WRITING 
“What books for a reference shelf for a writer's 
desk, to consult on matters of the mechanics of 
his art?” 
“Tuer Authors’ and Printers’ Dictionary,” by F. H. 
Collins (Oxford), to begin with, and a good desk 
dictionary, Webster’s “ Collegiate (Merriam) or the 
“Desk Standard Dictionary ” (Funk and Wagnalls). 
A new publication by John W. Manly and Edith 
Rickert, “ Writer’s Index of Good Form and Good 
English ” (Holt), and if this writer intends to get on 
a newspaper and wants to save himself some hard 
knocks in finding out things for himself, the “ Practi- 
cal Course in Journalism,” by Henry J. Brockmeyer 
(Press Guild Inc.). “ Writing of To-day ” is a collec- 
tion of models of every sort of journalistic prose, by 
J. W. Cunliffe and G. R. Lomer (Century), likely 
often to be consulted; if this were to be a journalist’s 
collection I would put in “ Editing the Day’s News ” 
by George C. Bastian (Macmillan), a highly practical 
new text, “The Writing of News,” by C. G. Ross 
(Holt), the books by Grant Milnor Hyde — his 
popular “‘ Handbook for Newspaper Writers,” “ News- 
paper Reporting and Correspondence” and “ News- 
paper Editing” (Appleton),— and those by W. G. 
Bleyer, especially “Newspaper Writing and Editing ” 
115 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  116 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
and “How to Write Special Feature Articles” 
(Houghton), with C. L. Edson’s “ The Gentle Art of 
Columning ” (Brentano). 
“Text, Type and Style, a Compendium of Atlantic 
Usage,” by George B. Ives (Atlantic Monthly Press), 
will be of practical value. “ The King’s English,” by 
Fowler and Fowler (Oxford), a snappish and stimu- 
lating work, must surely join the line, with the “ Con- 
cise Oxford Dictionary,” stepping firmly on the heads 
of all non-British words, but indispensable to a writer 
and the most readable dictionary on the market. No, 
that reminds me of Weekley’s incomparable “ Etymo- 
logical Dictionary of Modern English ” (Dutton), and 
nothing in the way of a word-book could be more 
readable than that. I think a writer would do well 
to keep that on hand, too. “ How to Use the Diction- 
ary,” by Martin C. Flaherty (Ronald), is a little book 
that will prove useful. 
Somewhere between a list for mechanics and one 
for style should come— they must surely come some- 
where — the works of Arthur S. Hoffman, “ Funda- 
mentals of Fiction Writing,” and “ Fiction Writers on 
Fiction Writing ” (Bobbs, Merrill). The former is a 
sound and sensible guide; things being as they are, 
it would be hard to find one more useful. The latter 
is the result of a questionnaire sent to so many novel- 
ists of such different types that the results are of high 
interest and enlightenment. “The Writer’s Art” 
(Harvard University Press) is a symposium of great 
writers on the intricacies of literary composition. 
If you must have a dictionary of similes, and I am 
often asked to recommend one, there is Frank Wil-
-P-A-G-E-127
WRITING AND WRITERS 117 
stach’s “ Dictonary of Similes ” (Little, Brown), and 
there won’t be another until someone has thought up 
17,000 new ones to take the places of those therein 
listed. For a quotation-cyclopedia either the latest 
of the many editions of the well-known Bartlett’s 
“Familiar Quotations ” (Little, Brown) or the “ Cy- 
clopedia of Practical Quotations,” by J. K. Hoyt (re- 
vised edition, Funk and Wagnalls), which includes 
more recent writers and is even larger. When I am 
asked to recommend a rhyming dictionary, I tell them 
“The Rhymer’s Lexicon” by Andrew Loring (Dut- 
, ton); it is the easiest to handle. The system is per- 
fectly simple: you are, let us say, in process of com- 
posing a valentine to Susan: you turn to (a) “ Words 
accented on the penult ” and in this to (b) “ U as in 
tuber and mover, fully and woolly,” and upon running 
down the lines you find that Susan is not there but 
are consoled by the possibilities of archducal— * 
nuchal — Pentateuchal, and quite taken off the subject 
by the glamour of diazeutic—emphyteutic— 
hermeneutic — maieutic — scorbutic — therapeutic 
—toreutic. So you do not write to Susan at all, 
which is probably all the better for you. 
F. Sturge Allen’s “Synonyms and Antonyms” 
(Harper) is an excellent book, but my personal pref- 
erence —I was brought up on it —is Roget’s “ The- 
saurus,” of which there is a new and much enlarged 
edition (Crowell). There must be on a writer’s desk 
the latest edition of “ Who’s Who in America” and 
the English “ Who’s Who,” and Smith’s “ Classical 
Dictionary ”— there is a concise edition in Every- 
man’s and one published by the American Book  
-P-A-G-E-128
  
118 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
Co.— and Brewer’s “Dictionary of Phrase and 
Fable” (Lippincott) may be often useful. Of the 
latter there is a new, revised edition, much enlarged. 
Brewer’s “ Reader’s Handbook” (Lippincott) has 
names famous in fiction, many plots and suchlike 
information; and Miss Keller’s “ Reader’s Digest of 
Books” (Macmillan) the plots of a vast number of 
novels and plays. This is as far as a list of these 
books can go, for the needs of the individual must 
determine. The subject of reference books in general 
is so thoroughly treated in Isadore Mudge’s bibliog- 
raphy, “ New Guide to Reference Books ” (American 
Library Association) that I can but refer readers 
building up such a library to its annotated lists. It 
deals with the important matter of choosing a large 
dictionary, among other things, and compares the 
encyclopedias. Bessie Graham’s “ Bookman’s Man- 
ual” (Bowker), while meant especially for book- 
sellers, includes much information on reference books. 
§ 28 
THE BUSINESS SIDE OF WRITING 
“What books would constitute a writer's business 
library?” 
Take “ The Business of Writing ” by Robert Cortes 
Holliday and Alexander Van Rensselaer (Doran) for 
cornerstone; you can build on it but no one book 
replaces it. From the preparation of the manuscript 
till it reaches the book-shops the steps in the process 
are explained in order, with sensible, portable advice;
-P-A-G-E-129
  
WRITING AND WRITERS 119 
I have taken out any amount for the use of inquirers 
to the Guipr. “ Writing to Sell,’ by Edwin Wildman 
(Appleton), is another book of direct advice, spending 
no time on anything but what the title indicates and 
that is what the free-lance wants to know about. It 
is mainly for the writer of special articles. Charles 
P. Cushing’s “ If you Don’t Write Fiction ” (McBride) 
was for some time before this the only book in this 
field, and it is still well worth owning. “ Making a 
Newspaper” by John L. Given (Holt) has advice on 
getting a job and the qualifications for holding it; 
“Where and How to Sell Manuscripts” is a list of 
6000 markets published by the Home Correspond- 
ence School of Springfield. This school publishes a 
long list of books on the technique of writing, some 
of which are very popular. There are chapters on 
markets in several of the above-mentioned books, 
especially Mr. Wildman’s. “Stories Editors Buy 
and Why ” by Jean Wick (Small, Maynard), prints 
a number of stories that editors have bought, with 
their own reasons why they bought them. It is not 
Miss Wick’s fault that this highly informing book 
somewhat depresses me. Some of the magazines 
have the same effect. 
“An Outline of Copyright Law,” by Richard C. 
De Wolfe (Luce, 1922), is a safe and simple guide for 
author, publisher and producer; it includes dramatic 
and moving-picture rights. Advice on copyright 
matters is to be found in several of these other books. 
I should think many a free-lance would be the better 
for a little book called “Getting Your Name into 
Print,” by H. T. McCauley (Funk), called “a manual  
-P-A-G-E-130
  120 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
of publicity methods,” though it is more for the object 
than for the writer of an interview. There is little 
that is spectacular about its advice, but some common 
sense about “the right approach to the newspapers.” 
When last I printed a reply to a question of this 
sort, a correspondent gently reproved me for not 
naming the magazines devoted to the interests of 
beginners in general and free-lances in particular. 
“Free-lance writing is a tough game,” said he, with 
evident feeling. “The chap who is trying to convince 
some editor that his writings are worth money needs 
encouragement.” So he told me to tell the world that 
“The Editor,” published at Highland Falls, N. Y.; 
“The Student Writer,” Denver, Col.; “ The Writer’s 
Monthly,” Springfield, Mass., and “The Writers’ 
Digest,” Cincinnati, are all good, and that “The 
Editor” has the advantage of coming every week. 
Also that if the beginner knew a member of the 
Author’s League he should borrow his copy of “The 
Author’s League Bulletin.” 
§ 29 
FORMING A STYLE 
What books will be of assistance in forming literary 
style? 
I atways approach this subject with diffidence, and 
in the hope that no intending writer gets the idea 
from me that reading any or all of the works I advise 
will give him the secret of a lucid and distinctive 
English style. But as people always like to read books 
about their own trade, whether for purposes of en- 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
WRITING AND WRITERS 121 
lightenment or of disagreement, I know that anyone 
who has tried to put words together into the shape 
of beauty will be interested in books concerned with 
that tantalizing process. 
For the young person, or for the beginner of any 
age, there are not a few text-books of high value. So 
high indeed is the value of the works of Charles Sears 
Baldwin that I could wish that young men and women 
beginning to write for publication could all have had 
the advantage of the background provided by his 
“Composition: Oral and Written” (Longmans). 
For somewhat younger students there is “ Good Writ- 
ing: a Modern Rhetoric,” by Arthur Leonard and 
Claude Fuess (Harcourt). ‘“ Writing Through Read- 
ing,” by Robert M. Gay (Atlantic Monthly Press), 
is a new plan for study that has proved greatly 
stimulating ; I was especially interested in what it has 
to say about translations; a lot of good time is 
going to waste along these lines in some schools. 
“The Study of Words,” by R. C. Trench (Doran), 
now in its twentieth edition, is the one on philological 
lines that I would choose for a writer’s library; there 
are, however, a number of excellent new ones, such 
as McKnight’s “English Words and Their Back- 
ground” (Appleton). “The English Bible as a 
Guide to Writing,” by C. S. Baldwin (Macmillan), 
is an important little book; how important one may 
realize who can see the influence of the St. James 
Version upon contemporary writers as different as 
Masefield, Dunsany, and Kipling. 
“The Handling of Words,” by Vernon Lee (Dodd, 
Mead), is the most scientific study so far of the proc-
-P-A-G-E-132
122 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
esses by which writers produce their effects, so pains- 
taking indeed that it would be dull— which it is 
not — were Vernon Lee herself a less skilled literary 
craftsman. “The Craft of Fiction,” by Percy Lub- 
bock (Scribner), compares the methods of Tolstoy, 
Flaubert, Meredith, Balzac, James and Dickens; it is 
sympathetic and suggestive even for the experienced 
writer; I have already spoken of Arthur Sullivant 
Hoffman’s “Fundamentals of Fiction Writing” 
(Bobbs Merrill). 
“The Problem of Style,” by J. Middleton Murry 
(Oxford), seems to me the most forward-looking book 
on the subject in the English language: its uses to 
the writer who would be “in the movement” are 
evident, and the reader who is carried along with it 
will be in the line of direction of contemporary litera- 
ture. Without turning aside to indicate writers 
whose works should be studied in this connection — 
indeed this has been done by the authors I have here 
set down—I cannot refrain from pointing out the 
value to a writer of the “Notebooks of Chekhov ” 
(Huebsch), every paragraph of which is charged with 
ideas, William Gerhardi’s “ Anton Chekhov” (Duf- 
field), an invaluable biography and criticism, and the 
importance of a careful study and comparison of the 
three volumes of short stories by Katherine Mansfield, 
“Bliss,” “The Garden Party” and the even more 
rewarding unfinished collection, “The Dove’s Nest” 
(all Knopf), with its baffling, stimulating glimpses 
into what Wells calls her “perfectly lovely mind.” 
‘Nor should one miss the selections from her journal 
in the Vale Review.
-P-A-G-E-133
  WRITING AND WRITERS 123 
I am often asked for a book that will be of value 
to the American book reviewer in the exercise of his 
_ profession, and since the appearance of “ Definitions ” 
by Henry Seidel Canby (Harcourt) I tell them to 
begin with that. I know of no book more likely to 
set a reviewer to his task with clearer: vision or to 
open the eyes of a reader to more qualities in what 
he reads. From the expressed gratitude of those to 
whom I advised it, it has done so in their cases. Read 
also the essays on reviewing in “Saturday Papers” 
(Macmillan) by the editors of the “ Literary Review,” 
and for the definition and application of the principles 
of “decency” in literature — together with other 
good ideas—“ The Literary Discipline” by John 
Erskine (Duffield) and the spirited defence of the 
Puritan spirit in Stuart Sherman’s “The Genius of 
America” (Scribner). 
§ 30 
LIVING AUTHORS 
“What books give information about living authors 
beyond that found in the British and American 
Who’s Whos?” 
Tue first book of this sort that I added to my 
library was Frederick Taber Cooper’s “Some Ameri- 
can Story Tellers” (Holt), soon followed by his 
“Some English Story Tellers,” collections of critical 
studies to which the student will still have occasion 
often to refer. Two bibliographies by Manley and 
Rickert, “Contemporary British Literature” and 
“Contemporary American Literature” (Harcourt), of  
-P-A-G-E-134
    124 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
which the former is the better, have condensed bio- 
graphical sketches and hints for the direction of study 
in cases where the compilers think study would be 
desirable. ‘Women Who Make our Novels,” by 
Grant Overton (Dodd, Mead), is another book for 
study-clubs to keep at hand; I have often to direct 
inquirers to its pages, and to the other books in this 
series, “Men who Make our Novels,’ by George 
Gordon, “Our Short Story Writers,” by Blanche 
Colton Williams, Howard W. Cook’s “ Our Poets of 
To-day,” and Thomas L. Masson’s “ Our Humorists 
of To-day.” Harry Hensen’s “ Mid-west Portraits ” 
(Harcourt) are of the Chicago school. “The Book- 
man’s Anthology of Essays” (Doran) and the cor- 
responding anthology of its poets, have brief bio- 
graphical notes. 
S. P. B. Mais is a popular intermediary ; his friendly 
attentions to books in general extend to those still 
smoking from the griddle. ‘“ Some Modern Authors ” 
(Dodd, Mead) has been reprinted to meet the calls 
of readers of his ‘“‘ Why We should Read ” and “ Books 
and Authors.” A. St. John Adcock’s “Gods of 
Modern Grub Street” (Stokes) is one of the latest 
of these manuals intended to introduce overseas living 
British authors to new audiences; setting Hardy 
apart for an opening chapter he proceeds alphabeti- 
cally from Belloc to Zangwill, with camera portraits 
of each. There are excellent camera studies also in 
the volume of “ Georgian Stories” (Putnam) includ- 
ing some of the less-well-known fiction writers. 
Another English introducer is R. Brimley Johnson, 
whose “Some Contemporary Novelists: Men,” and a
-P-A-G-E-135
  WRITING AND WRITERS 125 
corresponding volume for women, pay attention also 
to writers with small but discriminating audiences. 
William Parker’s “Modern Scottish Writers” 
(Hodge, Edinburgh, 1917) is so far as I know the 
only book devoted entirely to them; it includes the 
romantic figure of Cunninghame Graham, William 
Archer, Kenneth Graham, and of course Barrie, 
Sharp and Lang. “ The New Elizabethans,” by E. B. 
Osborn (Dodd), commemorates young dramatists like 
Harold Chapin and poets like Alan Seeger, fallen in 
battle. In “Some Impressions of My Elders” (Mac- 
millan) the usually urbane St. John Ervine gets jumpy 
now and again and spills too much pepper in the 
soup, but there is meat in it too. Of Frank Norris’s 
“Contemporary Portraits” (Brentano) the best is 
Shaw’s own portrait of himself. There is a funny ac- 
count of Shaw at the trial of Jasper for Drood’s mur- 
der, staged by English authors, in Coulson Kernahan’s 
“Celebrities” (Dutton), and anecdotes of other 
authors. Lewis Hind in “ Authors and I” and “ More 
Authors and I” (Dodd) is kindest of all the intro- 
ducers, so kind that he even ties pink ribbons in 
the lean and battle-scarred ears of Anatole France. 
“Writers of the Day ” (Holt) is a remarkably well- 
sustained series of small books about living authors, 
by authors themselves important, who have particular 
qualifications for the task of appraisal. Wells is 
described in the one by J. D. Beresford, France by 
W. L. George, Bennett by F. J. H. Darton, Kipling by 
John Palmer, Conrad by Hugh Walpole, Hardy 
by Harold Child, and there is one on Henry James by 
Rebecca West. ‘“ Some Modern Novelists ” by W. and 
   
-P-A-G-E-136
    126 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
H. T. Follett (Holt) goes from Meredith to a chapter 
on the new generation. Robert Lynd’s “ Books and 
Authors ” (Putnam) is a set of graceful and scholarly 
essays including not only Petrarch and John Clare but 
men as modern as H. M. Tomlinson, T. S. Eliot and 
Vachel Lindsay. “Appraisals and Asperities,” by 
Felix Schelling (Lippincott), is a series of reprinted 
newspaper articles on living British and American 
authors. “ Forty Years in my Book-Shop,” by Walter 
T. Spencer (Houghton), is full of stories of literary 
men by a famous book-dealer. ‘The Windmill” 
(Knopf) is William Heinemann’s contribution to the 
stock of publishers’ reminiscences, all of which that I 
have read I have found fascinating reading, and there 
are fortunately plenty of them to read. The latest is 
Henry Holt’s “Garrulities of an Octogenarian Editor” 
(Houghton), crowded with charming anecdotes. 
A number of helpful monographs on authors are 
sent free on request by their publishers: they include 
pamphlets on Swinnerton (Doran), Galsworthy 
(Scribner), Romain Rolland and De Morgan (Holt), 
Anatole France and Archibald Marshall (Dodd, 
Mead), Johan Bojer (Century) and several from 
Doubleday, Page. Publishers send biographical notes 
and criticisms of their authors on request, and many 
club-paper writers avail themselves of the privilege.

A NEWSPAPER OFFICE LIBRARY 
The first inquiry that came to the READER’s GUIDE 
when it was opened to the public, eight years ago, 
was for a desk library for the editor of a country 
newspaper. It has been several times republished 
on request and constantly sent by mail to inquirers ; 
in the course of time it has been somewhat enlarged, 
to meet the demands of a more exacting establish- 
ment, but it has never gone beyond the limits of a 
small collection, of whose usefulness and value in 
getting out a paper there could be no question. 
TueERE must be a supply of books for the verifying 
of proper names. The “Official Congressional 
Directory ” is issued at each session of Congress and 
contains biographies of all congressional personages 
at Washington, committees, residences and related 
information. “ Who’s Who in America” (A. N. 
Marquis, Chicago), and the British ‘“Who’s Who” 
(Macmillan) are indispensable. ‘ Who’s Who on the 
Stage” (Macmillan), “Canadian Men and Women of 
the Time” (Briggs, Toronto) and the little annual, 
“ Women of 1924,” issued by the Women’s News Ser- 
vice, 106 E. 119th Street, will be often consulted. For 
a large library, Grove’s “ Dictionary of Music and 
Musicians ” (Macmillan) in five volumes, and Cham- 
plin and Perkins’s “Cyclopedia of Painters and 
Paintings” (Scribner). For any newspaper library, 
“The American Yearbook” (Appleton), “ The New 
International Yearbook” (Dodd, Mead), “The States- 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  128 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
man’s Yearbook” (Macmillan) and “The Annual 
Register ” (Longmans) with the indispensable “ World 
Almanac” (Press Publishing Co.). 
Cram’s “ Atlas of the World” (Cram Pub. Co.) 
is convenient in size, reliable and not too expensive. 
Lippincott’s “ Gazetteer” (Lippincott) is a complete 
pronouncing geographical dictionary of the world, 
with recent and authentic information. There is a 
new atlas with “ The Century Dictionary ” in twelve 
volumes. “The New International Encyclopedia ” 
(Dodd, Mead) is apt to respond to office demands 
more often than the “ Britannica.” Of course, the 
local city directory, business directory and telephone 
book, “ American Newspaper Annual and Directory” 
(N. W. Ayer), a catalogue of all American newspapers 
with descriptions of every place in the United States 
and Canada where a newspaper is published, with 
much other information. “ Batten’s Agricultural 
Directory” (George Batten, New York), for the 
agricultural press. ‘“ The International Directory of 
Booksellers ” (Dodd and Livingston, 1914), a manual 
for bibliophiles with lists of publishers, public libra- 
ries, collectors, learned societies and the like. “ Sell’s 
World Press ” (Sells, London) an annual with lists of 
the world’s papers, complete and classified. “ Bul- 
linger’s Postoffice, Express and Freight Guide” (Bul- 
linger, N. Y.). A number of the library publications 
would be useful, like the “ Reader’s Guide to Periodi- 
cal Literature” (Wilson), but these take me into a 
special field. 
If I have left dictionaries to the last, it is for the 
sake of emphasis. “The Desk Standard Dictionary
-P-A-G-E-139
  WRITING AND WRITERS 129 
of the English Language,” the abridgment of the 
New Standard (Funk and Wagnalls), and Webster’s 
“Collegiate Dictionary” (Merriam), the largest 
abridgment of Webster’s New International Diction- 
ary, are more convenient to consult than the large 
volumes, but either or both these large dictionaries 
should be within reach. The most practical French- 
English dictionary is Cassell’s, published by Funk and 
Wagnalls, who also publish a good German-English 
one. The Spanish-English of Arturo Cuyas (Apple- 
ton) is good and not too bulky. There should be by 
all means the “Thesaurus of English Words and 
Phrases,” by Peter M. Roget (Crowell, new enlarged 
edition), and the “ Concise Oxford Dictionary of Cur- 
rent English” (Oxford Press), whatever other word- 
book is also there. The “ Dictionary of the Bible,” 
by James Hastings (Scribner), is encyclopedic in 
scope; it is in one Farge volume and deals with lan- 
guage, literature and contents. For quotations, Hoyt 
and Ward’s “Cyclopedia of Practical Quotations ” 
(Funk and Wagnalls, new enlarged edition) and for 
allusions and odd bits, Brewer’s “ Dictionary of 
Phrase and Fable” (Lippincott). 
There are so many more books that would be useful 
in some special department of newspaper work that I 
am especially glad to find that the School of Journal- 
ism of the University of Missouri has brought out a 
new, revised edition of the admirable pamphlet “A 
Newspaperman’s Library” (Univ. of Mo. Bulletin, 
vol. 22, no. 19), by Claire E. Ginsburg, Librarian, 
which has a chapter on reference books for news- 
paper offices, in which all these books are listed and
-P-A-G-E-140
  130 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
many more. Besides, it has lists of books for the 
study of journalism, biographies of newspapermen, 
novels about newspaper life, advertising literature, 
and other valuable selections, carefully annotated. 
I saw the original edition some years ago when I was 
a guest of this pioneer school of journalism, and have 
since read with profit the other bulletins, which are as 
practical and interesting as one might expect. from 
the school. 
This list of course includes no books on how to do 
things in journalism. Of these the latest is “ Editing 
the Day’s News,” by George C. Bastian (Macmillan), 
a detailed, lucid and comprehensive record of standard 
newspaper practices and methods. It is an introduc- 
tion in plain language to copyreading, headline writing, 
illustration, makeup and newspaper routine in general, 
the kind of book many a young man is looking for. 
For the earlier text-books on newspaper matters con- 
sult the bibliography above-mentioned. 
§ 32 
THE NEW POETRY 
“TI have read Miss Lowell’s ‘ Tendencies in Modern 
American Poetry,’ Marguerite Wilkinson’s ‘New 
Voices, and John Gould Fletcher’s preface to 
‘Goblins and Pagodas’: I am especially interested 
in the modern school of poetry, American, English 
and French, and would appreciate information as 
to books on technique or appreciation.” 
Tue best introduction to the “ new ” poetry for one 
who has been brought up on the “ old” is Marguerite
-P-A-G-E-141
WRITING AND WRITERS is1 
Wilkinson’s “ New Voices ” (Macmillan), because this 
book’s distinction lies in its pointing out in contem- 
porary verse “ beauty old yet ever new.” The general 
reading public reads far less poetry than one would 
think from the amount written about it. Poets write 
about new poetry, and the mass of readers keep on 
with the same old poems. The first service a poet 
can do to one of that mass is to show him that beauty 
is forever setting to new generations the task of recog- 
nizing her in new garments, even in new disguises. 
This book can be read by a complete outsider; most 
of our poets write for—or against —each other. 
For anthologies to supplement the poems it quotes, 
Louis Untermeyer’s “ Modern American Poetry ” and 
“Modern British Poetry ” (Harcourt, Brace), Padraic 
Colum’s “ Anthology of Irish Verse” (Boni) and the 
' pocket-companion “The Little Book of Modern 
Verse” (Houghton, Mifflin), made by Jessie Ritten- 
house. 
Amy Lowell’s “Tendencies in Modern American 
Poetry ” (Houghton, Mifflin) is indispensable. At this 
day I need not point out its qualities; I am at the 
moment concerned with its value in bridging the 
chasm between modern poets and their potential 
audiences. Louis Untermeyer’s “ New Era in Ameri- 
can Poetry” has been almost completely re-written. 
Appearing at the height of the controversial period, 
it had the polemic quality of its time: now even the 
title has been changed, and it has appeared as “ Ameri- 
can Poetry Since 1900” (Holt), and will meet the 
needs of many who love poetry and wish to know 
more about it. A new book on the older poets that
-P-A-G-E-142
  132 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
has just come from the Oxford University Press is 
W. Paton Ker’s “ The Art of Poetry.” 
For one deeply interested in the subject and willing 
to look at it from all points of view, there is a large 
and provocative collection of criticisms and apprais- 
als. “Convention and Revolt in Poetry” by John 
Livingston Lowes (Houghton, Mifflin, 31919) —in 
naming books about American poetry one should set 
down the year in which they appeared — “ The Young 
Idea,” opinions, mainly of poets, gathered by Lloyd 
Morris in 1917 (Duffield), “The Enjoyment of 
Poetry,” by Max Eastman (Scribner, 1913), Mary C. 
Sturgeon’s “ Studies of Contemporary Poets” (Dodd, 
1916), which is concerned with British poets, Ernest 
Boyd’s “TIreland’s Literary Renaissance” (Knopf), 
Lloyd Morris’s “The Celtic Dawn” (Macmillan, 
1917), “ John Masefield ” (Macmillan, 1922), in which 
W. H. Hamilton shows his devotion to his subject, and 
the chapters on the newer poets in John W. Cunliffe’s 
“English Literature During the Last Half Century ” 
(Macmillan, 1923) make a list that has surely the 
virtue of variety. “The New Poetry,” by Harriet 
Monroe and Alice Corbin Henderson (Macmillan, 
1923), is a collection of high value to the student; it 
is wide in its scope and takes in poems from both 
sides of the Atlantic. Selections from the Magazine 
“Contemporary Verse” appear in two “ Contempo- 
rary Verse Anthologies ” (Dutton). The introduction 
to the recently published “Collected Poems of 
Vachel Lindsay (Macmillan) should be pondered by 
students. 
Of the books devoted especially to organic rhythm
-P-A-G-E-143
  WRITING AND WRITERS 133 
the recently published work of Mary Austin, “The 
American Rhythm” (Harcourt), takes a high place, 
being not only thoughtful but thought-provoking. It 
is illustrated with her spiritual transcriptions of Ameri- 
can Indian poetry. ‘“ Concerning French Verse ” is an 
essay for English-speaking readers of French poetry, 
by Charles Cameron Clark (Yale Press) that should 
be read by any American who finds French poetry 
lifeless and colorless. Many do, for they do not really 
hear it, as they do English verse. For this latter there 
is a new book on “ The Speaking of English Verse,” 
by Elsie Fogerty (Dutton), which has some fascinat- 
ing discussions of rhythm and pattern from the time 
of the Greeks to the present. Helen Louise Cohen’s 
“Lyric Forms from France ” (Harcourt, Brace) is an 
anthology of translations with a scholarly introduction 
on the history and use of those tempting verse-forms 
on which so many of us have at one time or another 
tried our hands. Amy Lowell’s “Six French Poets ” 
(Houghton, Mifflin) is the finest book in English 
about the new forces in French poetry, and so far as 
I know the first to bring home to the American reader 
a sense of “new” poetry as a world-movement. The 
poems are quoted in the original and practical Eng- 
lish versions given in an appendix. 
“An Introduction to Poetry,” by Joy Hubbell and 
John Beatty (Macmillan), is that beginner’s book on 
technique for which I have been so often asked and 
that I feared would never be written. It has the in- 
formation about metres and stanza-forms and the like 
that more advanced books assume the reader knows 
all about. Paull Baum’s “ Principles of English Ver-
-P-A-G-E-144
  134 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
sification ” (Harvard University Press) includes free 
verse but pays more of its attention to the regular 
forms, considered in the light of psychology. Bliss 
Perry’s “ Study of Poetry” (Houghton, Mifflin) and 
John Erskine’s “The Kinds of Poetry ” (Duffield) are 
catholic in their sympathies and conservative in their 
tendencies. Theodore Maynard’s “Our Best Poets” 
(Holt) will greatly please all those who agree with 
him, which in general will mean, I think, those who 
have the same theological affiliations. A club making 
a program for study will be helped by “The New 
Poetry,” a pamphlet outline (H. W. Wilson Co.) by 
the carefully prepared programs on poetry that have 
appeared (1922-3) in The Bookman, by Amy 
Lowell’s admirable selection of “A Book Shelf of 
Modern Poets” prepared for the Doubleday, Page 
Book Shop and sent by Doubleday, Page free on 
request, in a leaflet, and by a handbook, “ Our Poets 
of To-day,” by Harold Cook (Dodd, Mead), a col- 
lection of notes about and poems by a great number 
of American versemakers great and small. For the 
student, the advice holds good to read what a poet 
has to say about American poetry before what anyone 
else says, and at least to give it the benefit of the 
doubt. One might almost say that in the United 
States only poets know much about the art of poetry. 
At least what they have to say about the art is far 
more enlightening. It has not been necessary for our 
musical critics to appear as virtuosi or for our art 
critics to exhibit at the Academy, but we have not 
yet developed a body of criticism of American poetry 
outside of the company of those who produce it.

THE SHORT STORY AND THE ESSAY 
A club studying the American short story and the 
essay asks about text-books and collections for 
such use. 
Tue largest collection, and the one that would 
provide the most material for a historical study of 
the short story in America is “American Short 
Stories” edited by Alexander Jessup (Allyn and 
Bacon). A club pledged to the contemporary may 
choose not only from the annual “ Best Short Stories ” 
chosen by Edward O’Brien (Small, Maynard), but 
also from the “O. Henry Memorial Award Prize 
Stories,” published annually by Doubleday, Page; “ As 
We Are,” a collection made by Walter Pitkin (Har- 
court, Brace) and dealing in everyday life without 
over-emphasis on the happy ending; “ Americans All” 
collected by Benjamin Heydrick (Harcourt, Brace) ; 
“Short Stories of America,” edited by R. L. Ramsey 
(Scribner) which is especially useful to a club or 
class dividing its study by regions, for the stories 
come from every section and there are good outlines 
for their discussion, and “Short Stories by Present 
Day Authors” (Macmillan) taken from collection 
volumes on the principle that the public should be 
encouraged to read and thus promote the publication 
of short stories in book form. “ American Short 
Stories” lists other collections, and has in general 
unusually full and well-selected book-lists. There 
have been two recent publications of general interest:
-P-A-G-E-146
  136 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
“The Development of the American Short Story ” by 
F. L. Pattee (Harper) a comprehensive work of 
high value to the student, and Edward O’Brien’s 
“Advance of the American Short Story” (Dodd, 
Mead), interesting but less important. The General 
Federation of Women’s Clubs, division of literature, 
sends out a study outline, “The Short Story,” for the 
use of women’s clubs. 
The American Library Association publishes a 
pamphlet called “ Viewpoints in Essays,’ an anno- 
tated book-list by Marion Horton, which covers the 
subject so well that I now send all club inquirers to 
its pages. If I were to choose but one general col- 
lection of essays for club study I have after much 
reading come to the conclusion that Christopher Mor- 
ley’s selection of “ Modern Essays ” (Harcourt, Brace) 
would be the one— but the charm of this book is 
that it makes it quite impossible to stop reading 
essays after it is completed. The introductions are 
what the reader wants, and just long enough. There 
is a five-volume set of “Modern English Essays ” 
(Dutton) admirably selected, and for a text-book 
Benjamin Heydrick’s “ Types of the Essay ” is uncom- 
monly good (Scribner): it groups its essays as per- 
sonal, descriptive, critical, reflective, etc. E. V. B. 
Knickerbocker’s “ Present-Day Essays” (Holt) is a 
text-book that is as good for the general reader as 
for the class-room. 
This “Viewpoint” series has also volumes on 
“Travel” by Josephine Adams Rathbone, and on 
“ Biography ” by Katherine Tappert; either of these 
would outfit a club studying along its lines and be
-P-A-G-E-147
    
WRITING AND WRITERS 137 
of value to a library committee. The publications of 
the American Library Association should be better 
known outside the profession, anyway: they are all 
useful to the book-chooser. 
A club studying the contemporary short story of 
England may provide itself with two excellent antholo- 
gies, “31 Stories” by as many authors (Appleton) 
which has an unusually wide range and general inter- 
est and “ Georgian Stories” (Putnam). Nor should 
it neglect anything written by or about Katherine 
Mansfield.

PUBLIC SPEAKING AND DEBATE 
“What are some of the most useful books for one 
wishing to become practiced in debate, public 
speaking, and parliamentary procedure?” 
A croup of young or older people desiring to organ- 
ize a debating society will find directions for so doing, 
with suggestions on how to prepare debates, lists of 
subjects, bibliographies and the like, in the “ Debater’s 
Manual ” one of the many publications of the H. W. 
Wilson Co. for the use and comfort of debaters. 
Their “ University Debater’s Annual ” gives each year 
representative intercollegiate debates on questions of 
to-day. For the man or woman desiring to make 
effective speeches at public forums or in labor meet- 
ings, or to conduct such discussions, a practical and 
efficient little book is “Joining in Public Discus- 
sion,” by Alfred Dwight Sheffield (Doran), one of a 
series called the “ Worker’s Book-shelf.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
  138 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
There are a number of excellent works on the 
principles of extempore public speaking, and for each 
one on the following list I have had personal recom- 
mendation from some reader who found it directly 
useful; “The Art of Extempore Speaking,” by the 
Abbé Bautain (McDevitt Wilson), a thorough-going 
and scholarly work recently brought back into print; 
I should think it would be useful in the preparation of 
sermons. “Public Speaking,” by James Albert 
Winans (Century), intended for the business man, 
the lawyer, the clergyman or the college man, and 
valuable to any of these. “The Public Speaker and 
what is Required of Him,” by Henry Howard Roberts 
(Dutton), good for overcoming difficulties and making 
the spoken word effective, for preparing addresses and 
for the collecting and using of facts. ‘ Public Speak- 
ing: a Natural Method” by Frank H. Kirkpatrick 
(Doran), a plea for naturalness and simplicity and 
some good advice on attaining these results, by a 
Canadian teacher of expression. “The Essentials 
of Extempore Speaking,” by J. A. Mosher (Macmil- 
lan), a compact statement of principles. With these 
specially designed manuals the student may also con- 
sult to advantage “ Brief Drawing,” by Ralph Curtis 
Ringwalt (Longmans, Green), for it is of great useful- 
ness to anyone whose duty it is to collect facts, to 
reason about them and to set them in their most 
telling arrangement. It is of special use to lawyers, 
but any research worker will find it valuable and I 
should think it would be a good book for anyone with

“Elements of Debating,” by Leverett S. Lyon
-P-A-G-E-149
WRITING AND WRITERS 139 
(University of Chicago), is for use in high schools and 
academies and is indeed used in a great many of 
them; the illustrations are from subjects in the stu- 
dent’s experience and the subjects are those that 
naturally provoke discussion. ‘“ Debating for Boys,” 
by William Horton Foster (Macmillan), would take 
in younger students: some of it appeared in a Boy 
Scouts’ magazine; this has an amusing chapter on 
“ How the Boys Organized.” 
“Textbook on Parliamentary Law,” by Hall and 
Sturgis (Macmillan), is not just another manual on 
procedure, but a text from which classes could be 
conducted, the lessons built one upon another and the 
principles made clear as they go. Clubs could use it 
to advantage and so could schools. There is a new 
book by the author of the standard “ Robert’s Rules 
of Order,” General Henry M. Robert, who celebrated 
his eighty-fifth birthday by announcing the publica- 
tion of his most comprehensive work, “ Parliamen- 
tary Law” (Century). This is in effect an encyclo- 
pedia of parliamentary procedure and law, a complete 
and authoritative book of reference.

THE MOVIES 
“What books discuss the influence of ‘moving- 
picture shows, whether educational, elevating or 
. demoralizing?” 
Tue most impassioned book about the movies is 
Vachel Lindsay’s “The Art of the Moving Picture”
-P-A-G-E-150
  
140 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
(Macmillan) which takes it seriously and leads it 
ever upward and on. The most important for the 
greatest number of reasons is undoubtedly Victor O. 
Freeburg’s “ The Art of Photo-Play Making” (Mac- 
millan). Another book by Dr. Freeburg has just ap- 
peared, “ Pictorial Beauty on the Screen” (Macmil- 
lan) which would do more than years of scolding to 
get audiences to see beauty and to require that it be 
provided for their eyes. It is also an aid to people 
who like to analyze their own thrills. 
“Motion Pictures in Education” by Ellis and 
Thornborough (Crowell) believes strongly in their 
value for this purpose but sets down a chapter of 
objections as carefully as it does the reports of what 
is being done in schools and elsewhere. “The Morals 
of the Movie,” by Ellis Paxson Oberholtzer (Penn) 
is the censor’s case, without rancor and clearly 
set forth. 
Agnes Platt, an English writer who gave some 
“ Practical Hints on Training for the Stage ” (Dutton), 
has just followed with an equally straight forward 
set of “ Practical Hints on Acting for the Cinema” 
(Dutton). The American non-professional reader 
will find it interesting mainly for its valuable and pos- 
sible inadvertant contributions to British psychology. 
“Moving Pictures: how they are made and 
worked,” by F. A. Talbot (Lippincott) is a romantic 
history of the progress of the industry, with a vast 
number of the details in which the movie public is 
so interested. Another descriptive book about the 
industry is “ With the Movie Makers,” by John Amid 
(Lothrop Lee and Shepard). The reminiscences of
-P-A-G-E-151
  
WRITING AND WRITERS 141 
Samuel Goldwyn, told in “Behind the Screen” 
(Doran), are full of experiences with stars in the movie 
firmament or already faded from it. Two other 
capable and sympathetic books of recent date are 
Bollman’s “ Motion Pictures for Community Needs” 
(Holt) which is a compendium of methods and mate- 
rials, and Van Zile’s survey of “That Marvel the 
Movie” (Putnam). To me the most delightful book 
about the art and industry is the novel “ Merton of 
the Movies” by Harry Leon Wilson (Doubleday, 
Page), but there are not a few other novels whose 
studio atmosphere is guaranteed correct, while in ad- 
dition to the annual reviews of short stories and of 
plays, published by Small, Maynard, there is now a 
“Best Moving Pictures of 1922-23,” from the same 
house, edited by Robert E. Benchley. 
All these are of recent issue; books on this subject 
age very swiftly.

TEACHING ENGLISH TO FOREIGNERS 
“What books are there for teaching English to adult 
foreigners?” 
Tue series of little books of “ English for Coming 
Citizens,’ by Henry H. Goldberger (Scribner), and 
his “How to Teach English to Foreigners” (pub- 
lished by the author, 1918) make an excellent be- 
ginning. W. E. Chancellor’s “ Reading and Language 
Lessons for Evening Schools” (American Book Co.) 
is especially for foreign and adult beginners. ‘“Teach- 
ing of English and the Foreign Born Woman” is a  
-P-A-G-E-152
142 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
little book by Minnie Newman published by the 
Woman’s Press; Mary Clark Barnes has a little one 
called “ Neighboring New Americans,” published by 
Revell. The subject of “Colloquial and Business 
English for Foreign Students” is treated by W. C. 
Thorley and R. T. Huirs in a small illustrated vol- 
ume published in 1921 by the London Macmillan and 
imported. The field is surveyed in one of the books 
of the excellent Americanization Series issued by Har- 
per, F. V. Thompson’s “ Schooling of the Immigrant.” 
§ 37 
PULITZER PRIZE BOOKS 
What works in American literature have been 
awarded the Pulitzer prizes since the establishment 
of these awards?” 
Tue first awards were made in 1917, the history 
prize to his Excellency Jules J. Jusserand for “ With 
Americans of Past and Present Days ”; that for biog- 
raphy for “ Julia Ward Howe,” by Laura E. Richards 
and Maud Howe Hall Elliott, assisted by Florence 
Howe Hall. In this year there were no awards to 
either drama or novel. In 1918 “His Family,” by 
Ernest Poole, won the novel prize, Jesse Lynch 
Williams’s play “ Why Marry?” the one for drama, 
James Ford Rhodes’s “History of the Civil War: 
1861-1865,” the history prize, and William Cabell 
Bruce’s “ Benjamin Franklin Self-Revealed,” the one 
for biography. 
Tn 1919 there were no awards for drama or history; 
 
-P-A-G-E-153
WRITING AND WRITERS 143 
the novel was Booth Tarkington’s “The Magnificent 
Ambersons ” and the biography Henry Adams’s “ The 
Education of Henry Adams.” There was no novel 
award for 1920; Eugene O’Neill’s “Beyond the 
Horizon ” was the prize play, Justin H. Smith’s “ The 
War With Mexico” the history, and the biography 
Albert J. Beveridge’s “ Life of John Marshall.” 
In 1921 Miss Zona Gale’s play “ Miss Lulu Bett,” 
produced at the Belmont Theatre in New York during 
that season, received the drama prize. Edith Whar- 
ton’s “ Age of Innocence ” won against a strong field, 
and “ The Americanization of Edward Bok,” and Rear 
Admiral Sims’s “ The Victory at Sea” (in collabora- 
tion with Burton J. Hendrick) took the biography 
and history prizes. 
In 1922 the awards were as follows: Novel: “ Alice 
Adams,” by Booth Tarkington (Doubleday, Page). 
Drama: “ Anna Christie,” by Eugene O’Neill, pro- 
duced at the Vanderbilt Theatre during the dramatic 
season 1921-1922. History: “The Founding of New 
England,” by James Truslow Adams (Atlantic 
Monthly Press). Biography: “A Daughter of the 
Middle Border,” by Hamlin Garland (Macmillan). 
The previous spring a poetry prize had been estab- 
lished among the awards, and in 1922 this was given 
to “Collected Poems ” by Edwin Arlington Robinson 
(Macmillan). The prize won by Sara Teasdale in 
1917 with her “ Love Songs ” was offered by Columbia 
University for the best book of poems by an American 
_ published during that year. 
_ The awards for 1923 were for the novel, “ One of 
Ours,” by Willa Cather (Knopf). For the original
-P-A-G-E-154
  144 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
American play, Owen Davis’s “Icebound” (Little, 
Brown). For the best book upon the history of the 
United States, “The Supreme Court in United States 
History,” by Charles Warren (Little, Brown). For 
the best American biography teaching patriotic and 
unselfish services to the people, “‘ The Life and Letters 
of Walter H. Page” (Doubleday, Page). For the 
prize in verse, the following by Edna St. Vincent 
Millay: “The Ballad of the Harp-Weaver” (Shay), 
“ A Few Figs from Thistles (Shay), and eight sonnets 
in “American Poetry: 1922, a Miscellany” (Har- 
court, Brace). 
Clubs or individuals who desire information about 
the awards, whether of prizes or travelling scholar- 
ships, should address the School of Journalism, Colum-

FRENCH LITERATURE 
“A reading circle studying French literature wishes 
to collect books in English dealing with this 
subject, especially those presenting contemporary 
French writers to the English-speaking public.” 
“Frencu Literature During the Last Half- 
Century,” by Pierre De Bacourt and J. W. Cunliffe 
(Macmillan), is an unusually valuable book for the 
study of contemporary writers, whether in class, by 
a club, or in the hands of a reader familiar with the 
language —it might even be used by a reader who 
knew very little French. This book has the list of 
winners of the Prix Goncourt for which I am con-
-P-A-G-E-155
WRITING AND WRITERS 145 
stantly asked. Its information is sound, and where 
it attempts appraisal its statements, though definite, 
are not dogmatic: after each chapter, which is gener- 
ally given to a single author, there is a list of his 
works, of books about him, and of translations of his 
works available in English. 
But tradition, literary and otherwise, counts for 
too much that is fine in France for it to be safe for 
a reading circle to concern itself with living writers 
only. Our literature begins over with every genera- 
tion; in France literature has never left off since it 
began, and it began a long time ago. For reading as 
well as study, you have at hand “ A History of French 
Literature,” by Professors Nitze and Dargan of the 
University of Chicago (Holt), which is the latest of a 
long line of surveys of the subject, Dowden’s “ French 
Literature” (Appleton), the “History of French 
Literature” by C. H. C. Wright (Oxford), the popular 
“French Literature” by Annie Lemp Konta (Apple- 
ton), and the scholarly and ingratiating introduction 
to the subject afforded by Emile Faguet’s “ Literary 
History of France” (Scribner). When a literature 
as distinctive as that of France is presented to a 
foreign audience by historians who are not French- 
men, I like to keep several of them going at once — 
I have never found one that was not interesting. 
Lytton Strachey’s “Landmarks in French Litera- 
ture,” long a favorite volume in the Home University 
Library, has been brought out (Holt) in a format cor- 
responding to that of his “Queen Victoria.” Mme. 
Duclaux, another English critic with a peculiarly 
sympathetic method, makes a series of studies of  
-P-A-G-E-156
  
  146 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
landmarks in spiritual development like Fenelon and 
Pascal in “The French Ideal” (Dutton). Her “ Life 
of Victor Hugo” (Holt) seems to me the most satis- 
factory treatment in one respect that he has received 
at the hands of a biographer — she somehow manages 
to show him sitting for his portrait in the character 
of Jove without letting you forget that he did have 
some Jovian qualities. “Victor Hugo: his Life and 
Love,” by A. C. P. Haggard (Doran), is a recent 
addition to the Juliet Drouet literature. F. W. M. 
Draper has a new and vigorous study of Hugo and 
his school in “The Rise and Fall of the French 
Romantic Drama” (Dutton). 
The “Great Writers” series (Scribner) has criti- 
cal biographies of Balzac, Hugo (by Marzials), Renan 
and Voltaire, and the “French Men of Letters” 
series (Lippincott) has volumes on Montaigne, Balzac, 
Rabelais, and Sainte-Beuve. Both of these collections 
are inexpensive and prepared by well-known writers 
for the use of the general reader. Add to these 
Brander Matthew’s comprehensive study of “ Moliére ; 
his Life and Works ” (Scribner). Speaking of Mon- 
taigne, George B. Ives, whose name stands high 
in our typographic history, has given years of tireless 
and devoted effort to the preparation of a translation 
as nearly perfect as is likely to be offered to imper- 
fect humanity, Bruce Rogers is, in a general way, 
supervising the lay-out, and in the course of time the 
result, in three or four volumes about the size of an 
Everyman’s, will be published by the Harvard Uni- 
versity Press, and sold by subscription. Montaigne
-P-A-G-E-157
  WRITING AND WRITERS 147 
lovers will be glad to know of this, and put their 
names down beforehand; it is Mr. Ives’s masterwork. 
Where most histories of literature leave off Wini- 
fred Stephens’s “French Novelists of To-Day” 
(Dodd) begins: its two volumes present to English 
and American readers not only writers as well-known 
as France, Loti or Bourget but men as significant and 
as little known out of their own country as Boylesve, 
women as Marcelle Tinayre. For a sweep of the field 
that takes in almost every one of importance and 
presents them as a friend presents, Mme. Duclaux’s 
“Twentieth Century French Writers” (Scribner), 
which would supplement Bacourt and Cunliffe’s book. 
A. L. Guerard’s “ French Prophets of Yesterday ” (Ap- 
pleton) must be included, and I cannot leave out 
his brilliant study of “ French Civilization from its 
Origins to the Close of the Middle Ages” (Hough- 
ton, Mifflin). “ Feudal France and the French Epic,” 
by G. B. Fundenberg (Princeton University Press), 
is a monograph interesting to students in this con- 
nection; it is based on the examination of feudal 
epic poetry and contemporary chroniclers. 
Coming back to our contemporaries, “ Some Modern 
French Writers,” by E. Turquet-Milnes (McBride), 
traces the creative and unifying influence of the im- 
pulse underlying the philosophy of Bergeon as it ap- 
pears in the work of eight moderns; this is one of the 
few books in English to give adequate treatment to 
Peguy or to consider Claudel at length. Albert 
Schinz’s “French Literature in the Great War” 
(Appleton) has been followed by his pamphlet bring-
-P-A-G-E-158
  148 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
ing the survey practically to date, “Le Roman Fran- 
cais depuis la Guerre,” reprinted from the Modern 
Language Journal. During the war Pierre de Lanux’s 
“Young France and New America” (Macmillan) 
brought to our attention writers as important and as 
little known to us as Pierre Hamp. 
For French drama several works are elsewhere 
listed, but I may here mention “The Contemporary 
Drama of France,” by Frank W. Chandler (Little, 
Brown), which runs from Scribe and Augier and 
names a great many dramatists, with brief analyses 
of their work, indicating where they belong in the 
various movements. ‘“ Contemporary French Drama- 
tists” by Barrett Clark (Stewart Kidd) begins about 
1890 and considers each man more at length, with a 
good deal of quotation. 
For translations of recent books consult the book- 
lists in “ French Literature During the Last Half- 
Century ” and watch the publishers’ announcements, 
for more are coming all the time. I must call atten- 
tion, however, to the way in which the remarkable 
translation of the works of Anatole France pub- 
lished by Dodd, Mead— and such imposing books 
they are to look at too— keeps abreast of their pub- 
lication in French; to the speed with which Marcel 
Proust’s “Swann’s Way” (Holt) appeared to intro- 
duce, in Mr. Moncrieff’s accurate and sympathetic 
translation, the first two volumes of “ A la Recherche 
du Temps Perdu,” and the way in which Romain 
Rolland’s “Annette and Sylvie” (Holt) is coming 
out but a length behind the French original. Also, 
considering how good a dress the Edition Nouvelle
-P-A-G-E-159
    
WRITING AND WRITERS 149 
Revue Francaise gave to the original of “Swann’s 
Way,” I am glad to see that the English version is 
one of the prettiest pieces of the season’s bookmaking. 
The year has given us several more or less important 
finds, among them Maupassant’s “Dr. Heraclius 
Gloss ” (Brentano), and promises soon a hitherto un- 
published five-act drama by Balzac, “Cromwell,” 
which the Princeton University Press will issue in a 
limited edition, the original manuscript reproduced in 
fac-simile, an extraordinary item. 
§ 39 
SPANISH LITERATURE 
“What are the most important books on Spanish 
literature from which an American may get an idea 
of contemporary Spanish fiction and drama, and 
who are the writers of Spain at the present time 
with whose works (in Spanish) I should be 
familiar?” 
Tue standard works are Ticknor’s “History of 
Spanish Literature” (Houghton, Mifflin), and Fitz- 
maurice Kelly’s “History of Spanish Literature ” 
(Appleton), and “Primer of Spanish Literature ” 
(Oxford University Press). To these should be added 
“Main Currents of Spanish Literature,” by J. D. M. 
Ford (Holt), which brings the subject practically to 
the present day ; this has also a chapter on the develop- 
ment of Spanish-American literature. Coester’s 
“Literary History of Spanish America ” (Macmillan) 
is very full; it divides the subject by countries. Gold- 
berg’s “Studies in Spanish American Literature” 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
  150 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
(Brentano) is especially valuable for its presentation 
of the work of Rodo. Rodo’s “ Ariel” is, fortunately 
for us, now accessible in an English translation 
(Houghton, Mifflin). Hume’s “ Spanish Influence on 
English Literature” (Nash, London), and Underhill’s 
“Spanish Literature in the England of the Tudors ” 
(Macmillan) are interesting to the student, and so is 
F. W. Chandler’s brilliant study of “The Novel of 
Roguery ” (Houghton, Mifflin). 
The following list will be found to be fairly repre- 
sentative, without, of course, being in any sense of 
the word complete. 
Novelists of the period closing with 1898: Alarcon, 
Pereda, Valera, Clarin, Picon, Palacio Valdes, Pardo 
Bazan and Perez Galdos. Dramatists: Ayala, 
Tamayo, Echegaray, Perez Galdos, Guimera, and 
Dicenta. Some of the more notable of these belong 
also in the post-1898 group-novelists: Blasco Ibanez, 
Pio Baroja, Azorin, Lopez de Haro, Alberto Insua, 
Silverio Lanza, Valle Inclan, Ricardo Leon, Perez de 
Ayala, Concha Espina, the leading woman novelist of 
Spain, Martinez Sierra, Miro, and Felipe Trigo: 
dramatists; Benavente, Martinez Sierra, the brothers 
Quintero, Carlos Arniches, Linares Rivas, Marquina, 
Rusinol and Iglesias. The critic, essayist and philoso- 
pher Miguel de Unamuno must be taken into account 
by anyone who is studying the literature of Spain. 
Fortunately his great work “The Tragic Sense of 
Life in Men and in Peoples” (Del Sentimiento 
Tragico de la Vida) has been put into English (Macy 
millan) with an introductory essay by Salvador de 
Madriaga. 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
  
WRITING AND WRITERS 151 
The student desiring to put English into Spanish 
may profitably read Leonard Williams’s “ Models for 
Translating English into Spanish” (Dutton) with ex- 
amples such as Rafael Pombo’s version of Hamlet’s 
soliloquy, M. A. L. Caro’s of Shelley’s “ Skylark ” and 
Julio Nombela’s of Poe’s “ Gold Bug.” 
§ 40 
CHINESE POETRY 
“What books will give an English-speaking reader an 
idea of Chinese poetry?” 
In the first place, Herbert Giles’s delightful “ His- 
tory of Chinese Literature,” (Appleton) is back again 
in print; Christopher Morley clashed cymbals over 
its reappearance. In 1898 Quaritch published a selec- 
tion of “Chinese Poetry in English Verse” which 
Herbert Giles had given the world with an ingratiating 
little introduction. In 1904 the Oxford Press brought 
out two large volumes of “Cantonese Love Songs,” 
one for the Chinese text, the other for the English 
translation by Cecil Clementi: they are still in print 
and so is Charles Budd’s “ Chinese Poems ” published 
by them in 1912. Their “ Sacred Books of the East ” 
series enshrines “ The She-King or Book of Poetry ” 
in two massive volumes for the scholar: the general 
reader is provided for by the series of little books 
called “ Wisdom of the East ” (Dutton) of which this 
forms one volume. Others are L. Cranmer-Byng’s 
translations of Chinese classical poets under the titles 
“A Lute of Jade” and “A Feast of Lanterns.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  152 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
Judith Gautier translated some “ Chinese Lyrics from 
the Book of Jade” into French and James Whitall 
set them to English (Huebsch). 
Helen Waddell’s “Lyrics from the Chinese” 
(Houghton, Mifflin) came in 1913, and in 1915 Ezra 
Pound’s “ Cathay ” (Mathews) based on the notes of 
Ernest Fenellosa. In 1916 there was a new, enlarged 
version of Clifford Bax’s paraphrases (Henderson, 
London) as “ Twenty-five Chinese Poems.” In 1920 
Arthur Guiterman’s poem-versions of Chinese 
proverbs, “ Chips of Jade” were published (Dutton). 
Amy Lowell’s English versions of Florence Ayscough’s 
translations published by Houghton, Mifflin as “ Fir- 
flower Tablets” came next, and in 1922 Shigoyoshi 
Obata’s translation of the “ Works of Li Po the Chi- 
nese Poet” (Dutton). There are poems from China 
in E. Powys Mathers’s “Coloured Stars.” (Houghton), 
love-songs on Asiatic themes. 
Meantime Arthur Waley had taken first place for 
a combination of scholarship and poetic beauty of 
translation, with his “170 Chinese Poems” and 
“More Translations from the Chinese ” (Knopf) and 
another volume is just published “The Temple and 
other Poems” (Knopf) taken from the later poetry, 
of which few examples have been put into English. 
Wytter Bynner has been at work literally for years 
in collaboration with a Chinese scholar on what will 
certainly be the largest and probably the most im- 
portant publication of this kind. Now and again the 
book shows signs of active eruption, throws up a 
title or a bit of news, and subsides once more.

§ 41 
THE JAPANESE DRAMA 
What is there in English for one who would like to 
know something about the national drama of 
Japan? 
Witi1am Georce Aston’s famous “ History of 
Japanese Literature” (Appleton) is still in print, 
and affords a basis for study of the drama. Also 
there is a great deal about literature, drama and every- 
thing else in the “ History of the Japanese People ” 
by Frank Brinkley and Baron Kikuchi (Doran) which 
covers a vast number of matters Japanese. 
The beginner will be more at home if his first book 
is “Tales from Old Japanese Dramas” by Asatoro 
Miyamori (Putnam). This book, by the professor of 
English in Toyo University, Tokyo, begins with a 
description of the methods and ideals of Japanese 
dramatic art, with pictures of famous players and of 
stage settings including those for marionettes. Prof. 
Miyamori’s “ Tales of the Samurai ” has been recently 
published (in English) by Kelly and Walsh, Tokyo, 
1922; it has in addition to its summaries of old plays, 
one modern play complete, the two-act historical 
tragedy, “Lady Hosokawa,” by Kido Otamoto, a 
living playwright so popular that one or another of 
his plays is said always to be in production some 
where in the Empire. There is a condensed version of 
“Lady Hosokawa” in The Living Age, vol. 314, 1922. 
In his “ The No Plays of Japan” (Knopf), Arthur 
Waley advises the reader to glance over the plays 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
  154 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
that he gives before reading the introduction. If I 
may add to this sound suggestion it is by the hint 
that before beginning the introduction he should 
glance over the paragraph in it that shows how “ The 
Duchess of Malfi” would have been done if it had 
been a No play. I do not see how the essential dif- 
ferences of Eastern and Western classic ideal in drama 
could be better set forth by example. “Noh; or: Ac- 
complishment ” by Ernest Fenellosa, put into book 
form from his notes and studies, by Ezra Pound, was 
published here by Knopf in 1917 but is out of print; it 
may be found in many library collections, a group of 
studies touching on some twenty plays with tentative 
records of some of the music. Mrs. M. C. Stopes with 
T. Takurai has translated three plays and summarized 
a fourth in “ Plays of Old Japan ” (Heinemann 1913). 
Takedo Izuma’s “ The Pine Tree,” given by the Wash- 
ington Square Players as “ Bushido,” is published by 
Duffield with an historical introduction. Leon Du- 
ran’s “ Plays of Old Japan” (Seltzer) are variations 
on old and violent dramas. 
A number of Japanese plays have appeared in our 
magazines: “ Somebody-Nothing,” an ancient Japan- 
ese farce translated by Michio Itow and Louis Ledoux, 
in Asia, vol. 21, 1921; another, “ The Melon Thief,” 
translated from a mediaeval farce by Shigeyoshi 
Obata, in Drama, vol. 10, 1919; “ Sumida-gasa,” 
adapted from a No drama of Motomasa by Colin 
Campbell Clements, in Stratford Journal, vol. 2, 1918 
and “ The Shower: the Moon,” by Yone Noguchi, in 
the London Poetry Review, 1917. ‘“ Three Modern 
Japanese Plays,” representing the new movement in
-P-A-G-E-165
WRITING AND WRITERS 155 
Japanese drama and the influence of western tech- 
nique, are published in one volume (Stewart Kidd). 
There are two dramas, “The Razor” and “The 
Madman on the Roof,” and a farce, “ Nari-kin,” of 
which the second, a mystic play, will be the most 
sympathetic to us. 
§ 42 
HISTORIES OF LITERATURE 
“What are the most valuable single-volume histories 
of the literatures of the world, including Chinese 
and Japanese, for the use of the general reader?” 
So far as I am concerned, nothing has taken the 
place of Taine’s “ English Literature,” on which I 
was brought up and to which I owe far more than 
the information with which it provided me. It is 
still unsurpassed for its power of presenting the sub- 
ject as a whole, consecutively thought out, and while 
some of its judgments no longer content me, I have 
long since learned to thank them, if not always for 
light upon English literature certainly for illumination 
on French methods and ideals. For an elementary 
work, a text-book arranged for ready reference but 
suitable also for reading purposes, “The History of 
English Literature,” by William Vaughan Moody and 
Robert Morse Lovett (Scribner), is as good as any 
and more readable than most. The library collector 
will be safe with the new edition of the four-volume 
“ History of English Literature,” by Richard Garnett 
and Edmund Gosse (Macmillan), which is akin to the 
surveys now appearing, and is amply illustrated.
-P-A-G-E-166
  156 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
For the real student, however, the “ Cambridge His- 
tory of English Literature” (Putnam) is clearly the 
one to be owned, though it is of course more a library 
than a book, running to fourteen royal octavo volumes 
of some six hundred pages each. 
I have elsewhere spoken about histories of French 
literature. There is by no means so wide a choice in 
the matter of German literature, but Kuno Francke’s 
“History of German Literature as Determined by 
Social Forces” (Holt) is the one from which I think 
the student will receive the most direct assistance. 
Calvin Thomas’s “ History of German Literature” 
(Appleton) is readable and reliable; it is one of the 
same series as the famous “ History of Chinese Litera- 
ture,” by Herbert Giles, and W. G. Aston’s “ History 
of Japanese Literature” (both Appleton). 
The student of Russian literature has now a fairly 
wide range of works in English translation, which is 
of course greatly enlarged if he reads French and 
German, while for text-books he may avail himself of 
the scholarly “Literary History of Russia,” by A. 
Bruckner (Scribner), the colorful “Ideals and Real- 
ities in Russian Literature,” by Peter Kropotkin 
(Knopf), Maurice Baring’s sympathetic sketch of 
“An, Outline of Russian Literature” (Holt, Home 
University Library), the “ History of Russian Litera- 
ture” by Waliszewski (Appleton) and a condensed 
“Guide to Russian Literature” by M. J. Olgin (Har- 
court, Brace) that study-clubs will find useful for its 
compact arrangement and because it includes writers 
so recent as not elsewhere to be set down in English 
texts. I have noted English works on Spanish. litera-

ture; the student of Italian literature will find any 
number of works on special periods or authors, but 
very few treating the subject generally, and these — 
Garnett’s “Italian Literature” (Appleton), for in- 
stance, or Collison-Morley’s “ Modern Italian Litera- 
ture ” (Little, Brown) — are most of them out of print. 
Cesare Foligno’s “Epochs of Italian Literature” 
(Oxford University Press) is five essays dealing briefly 
with its dawn, the Renaissance, the transition to 
modern times, the rise of the nation and modern Italy, 
with a list of the works of authors mentioned in 
the text. 
“The Cambridge History of American Literature,” 
in four volumes (Putnam) is again more a library than 
a book, but as a work of reference it is of un- 
questioned value and importance: the articles are by 
specialists but written for the general reader. The 
“Short History of American Literature” (Putnam), 
based upon this, is in one volume. Barrett Wendell’s 
“A Literary History of America” (Scribner) is es- 
pecially interesting in its treatment of our begin- 
nings; for our later days, consult Fred Lewis Pattee’s 
“ History of American Literature Since 1870” (Cen- 
tury) with the two valuable volumes by Carl Van 
Doren, “ The American Novel,” which begins at the 
beginning, and “Contemporary American Novelists: 
1900-1920” (Macmillan), Amy Lowell’s “ Tendencies 
in Modern American Poetry” (Houghton, Mifflin), 
and Louis Untermeyer’s “American Poetry Since 
1900” (Holt). 
While Richardson and Owen’s “ Literature of the 
World” (Ginn) has a sounding title, it is an unpre-

tentious and — for its own purpose —a really useful 
text or reference book giving a brief synopsis of the 
record in literature of the various countries of the 
world so that an intelligent adult would get from it 
a general idea of the development of this form of 
human expression and the more famous men who have 
contributed to this development. It is the outcome 
of many years work with classes in literature at Hull 
House, and will be useful to anyone conducting 
such classes.

BOOK-MAKING 
“What books will give me information on the correct 
making of books, in regard not only to usage, but 
to matters not covered in the usual manuals of 
style, such as the relative order of preface, table of 
contents, etc., proportion of margin to print on page, 
proper type to use in legends of pictures, and similar 
topics?” 
“Rutes for Compositors and Readers,” by Horace 
Hart, is the usage of the Oxford University Press, 
the oldest establishment in the world printing the 
English language. This little book also covers usage 
where French, German and Italian words are used 
in connection with English text, and for English has 
been prepared in accordance with the very best usage. 
The spelling is of course British, not American, but 
this need not interfere with its value. The only book 
on American uses in the East is “Text, Type and 
Style” by George B. Ives (Atlantic), important for
-P-A-G-E-169
WRITING AND WRITERS 159 
the fact that it has the usage of the Atlantic Monthly. 
We have no other book to compare with Ives’s. 
For the correct use of “ oddments ”: that is, dedica- 
tion, preface, contents and the like, see chapter 37 
of the first volume of “ Modern Printing,’ by John 
Southward, London, third edition, r915. 
For the correct use of printing types, “ Printing 
Types: their History, Forms and Use,” by D. B. 
Updike (Harvard), has become the standard work. 
Chapter 23 of the second volume, on “ The Choice of 
Types,” is indispensable to anyone connected with 
book-making. 
For book-composition in general, Theodore L. De 
Vinne’s series “ The Practice of Typography ” is. still 
of value, although one of the four volumes, “ Plain 
Printing Types,” has been largely superseded by 
Updike’s work. Of the other three volumes “ Title 
Pages” gives a historical survey with comments and 
fac-similes, “Correct Composition” is a manual of 
style, and “ Modern Book Composition ” treats among 
other things of footnotes, running titles, margins and 
such matters. 
I should add, however, that the general design and 
good taste of a book finally depends on the typo- 
graphic designer who lays it out, and cannot be 
covered by any text-book. 
§ 44 
“BETTER BEGIN WITH—” 
When someone asked what book by Hergesheimer he 
should read first in order to keep on reading, and 1
-P-A-G-E-170
  160 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
said in the reply that the order of approach meant 
as much with Cabell and Conrad, readers at once 
asked for “the logical order of taking up” these 
and other authors whom they named. 
Loctc has little to do with it. It is a matter of 
the emotion aroused by the first impression. It 
seems a pity for a well-meaning reader to begin with 
a book more than likely to produce an emotional 
effect that will keep him away from that author’s 
other books or at the best leave him in a state of 
mind that later reading must overcome. A born Ca- 
bellian, like a predestined Conradian, can begin any- 
where, but one whose election is not so sure had better 
start Cabell with “Domnei ” or the stories in “Gallan- 
try ”—“ Domnei” is the book with which seven out 
of ten women had better make a beginning. 
It is worth while taking pains with people to make 
them friends, in time, with “Lord Jim,” but if you 
begin with it and take your eyes off the page a 
moment, Conrad has slipped out the story from under 
and someone else is telling it in some other time 
and place. “Nostromo” goes straight ahead, and I 
have earned many a long gratitude by starting people 
with it. Of the later ones, “ Victory,” or this dashing 
newest one of all, “The Rover” (Doubleday, Page). 
“The Three Black Pennys,” followed by “ Java 
Head,” give two points that determine the direction 
of Hergesheimer’s line of progress. If you begin 
George Moore with “ Esther Waters” you will have 
the best first, but you will jiave to begin all over again 
after it. I should say that “ A Mummer’s Wife ” were 
likely to lead to further acquaintance: he is so inter-
-P-A-G-E-171
  
WRITING AND WRITERS 161 
ested in his people and so sensitively aware of all they 
do and feel that it gives the book a pleasant illusion 
of kindliness. 
When people ask me where to begin with Hardy, I 
know they have been frightened by reports of “ Jude 
the Obscure.” Now while this is almost the only 
novel by a Victorian that has not been put out of 
business by Dr. Freud, while it is so modern that after 
twenty years we are but just catching up with it, 
it will stop most readers from going any further with 
Hardy’s novels. It stopped Hardy from going any 
further with them; there seemed, indeed, nowhere to 
go. Whereas beginning with “The Woodlanders ” or 
“The Return of the Native” may mean a long and 
beautiful journey. 
Anatole France presents a problem to the book 
introducer, or rather, inquirers present him to me as 
a problem with extraordinary frequency. In one way, 
it makes little difference where you begin: vaccinate 
twenty Americans with France and in but a couple of 
cases will it take. In these it takes furiously. I used 
to try ingratiating methods, beginning inquirers per- 
sonally unknown to me on. “ Sylvestre Bonnard ” or 
“ My Friend’s Book,” while outraged Francians wrote 
in to ask if I were trying to protect morals from 
literature. But I start people on Sylvestre no more; 
sooner or later they are bound to run against one of 
those snatches of sensuality that the American 
devotee has learned to take along with the rest and 
for the sake of the rest —and then all the gentle 
approach has gone for nothing. So now I say, read 
“The Gods Are Athirst,” and even if it leads you no
-P-A-G-E-172
ee ee ee 
162 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
further in the company of M. Anatole, you will have 
had one book at once true France, a great piece of 
fiction, and the most vivid and trustworthy novel of 
the French Revolution. In my own case, the impulse 
started by the first book I read, “ Thais,’ shot me 
through the Bergeret novels scarcely pausing for 
breath, and is still at work. 
There are of course other reasons why people ask 
where to begin Balzac. They want to know where the 
action of the Comédie Humaine starts, and which is 
the novel that they can read without constantly find- 
ing references to someone he takes for granted you 
know all about. Of course the Comédie Humaine 
does not start with any one book any more than the 
twentieth century started in any one place or on the 
stroke of midnight, December 31, 1900. You really 
find out about a Balzac person as you do about a 
person in real life, here a little, a little somewhere 
else, all at once perhaps a good deal from personal 
experience. If you must have the obvious facts in his 
career, in real life you look them up in “ Who’s Who ” 
and in Balzac in that corresponding volume, labor of 
love and monument to the patience of Cerfbeer and 
Christophe, the “ Repertory of the Comédie Humaine.” 
In this you will find every human being in the humane 
comedy set down in alphabetical order with all that 
Balzac has told you about him in any book. My 
advice to one preparing to go on a Balzac bat is to 
read before beginning it the essay on “ Balzac’s 
Human Comedy” in “ John Morley and other Es- 
says,” by George McLean Harper (Princeton Uni- 
versity Press), with a selection of twenty-one novels
-P-A-G-E-173
WRITING AND WRITERS 163 
to read in order. He thinks that this selection makes 
a more splendid artistic impression than the entire 
work of which these novels are a part; at least the 
proportion of masterpieces is greater than in the whole 
collection.

THE ALLUSIVE MIND 
“ Many of the persons to whom I have spoken about 
Cabell’s ‘Jurgen’ have voiced the opinion that it 
cannot be comprehended unless one has a thorough 
knowledge of Greek mythology. Can you advise 
me if this is so? If it is, can you suggest anything 
for sources of information which might be of value 
to a prospective reader?” 
A course in Greek mythology would do no harm. 
“The Golden Bough” would help — there is a one- 
volume edition now (Macmillan). A large, desultory, 
and vivacious interest in the Middle Ages in France, 
and in the affairs of Provenge in particular, would be 
even better, and some acquaintance with the social 
history of Richmond, Va. The six large and delightful 
volumes of Le Moyen Age et la Renaissance, histoire 
et description des moeurs et usages, du commerce et 
de Vindustrie, des sciences, des arts, des litératures 
et des beaux-arts, by Lacroix of Paris — especially 
the references to superstitions, incantations, and the 
like — these would do nicely. 
But there is sardonic humor in the idea of a stu- 
dent conscientiously grubbing through all this in order 
to qualify to read “ Jurgen ” — or, if you will, let me
-P-A-G-E-174
er ee eee ree re ee 
164 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
advise you at the outset, “ Figures of Earth,” which 
has the gist of Jurgen and is much better done. For 
all this learning would be of no avail in reading the 
work of Mr. Cabell unless, like him, you have what 
for lack of a better word I must call the “ allusive ” 
mind — one that loves to recognize the tail of a quo- 
tation as it whisks around the corner; one that enjoys 
tossing together bits of this learning and that, Norse, 
Provencal, Roman, or what not, into fantastic figures 
like those in which the men of the Middle Ages set 
forth their eager imaginings, devils built of a dozen 
creatures, “ anthropophagi and men whose heads do 
grow beneath their shoulders.” 
Given a vast deal of learning, Mr. Cabell finds his 
fun in playing with it, and the more learning you have 
the more chance of finding your fun in seeing this 
bit or that flash by and recognizing it as it flits. It 
is as if Mr. Cabell were saying to you: “ You and I, 
sir, have this joke to ourselves. See what the public 
is missing! ” 
For the scholar has something the same contempt 
for the general reader that the latter has for him. We 
pity him because he lives with old books; he pities 
us because we don’t suspect what extraordinary adven- 
tures in living are set down in them. Perhaps the 
world has grown better ; certainly the roughest of the 
curiosa are pretty old. 
But there is another way to read “ Jurgen.” I quite 
understand a woman writer’s statement that she 
could scarcely wait for her baby to be old enough to 
read that book aloud to her. She was going to ad- 
minister it at the age just after “ Peter Rabbit.”   
 
-P-A-G-E-175
WRITING AND WRITERS 165 
Read “ Figures of Earth ” as you would to a child, for 
the sheer fairy tale, straight ahead with no searching 
for hidden meanings, and you will have a splendid 
time. If life has meanings for you, “Figures of 
Earth” will have in time, and that without any 
special learning. My little girl once told me: “When 
the others go to the theatre they see the play, but 
you and I, we see the intentions.” The “ intentions ” 
of Mr. Cabell are not to be seen by looking for 
them; they have to creep up on you.

“HOW DO YOU PRONOUNCE— ?” 
A librarian in the Middle West started something 
when he asked me to help his profession in the 
exercise of its duties by indicating the pronuncia- 
tion of a list of names of certain popular authors ; 
started a rush of additions to the list from book- 
sellers, from club women, from plain ordinary 
readers from here to California. 
“Tr would seem ” he moaned, “ that names of ques- 
tionable pronunciation must nowadays be considered 
a commercial asset, as so many of the new writers 
affect them.” Affect, quotha? A name starts life with 
you like an appendix vermiformis, if you don’t like 
it you have to have it removed. Take a pretty name 
like Padraic Colum, now. I remember when Dr. 
Wheeler introduced a young Irish poet to an Ameri- 
can audience by saying that he ought to write poetry 
with a name like Pah-dray-ic Co-lum. That bard
-P-A-G-E-176
  166 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
promptly disclaimed two of the five syllables and 
stood revealed as Pahd-ric Colm — two bites and one 
gulp. Somerset Maugham is Mawm; the author of 
“John Ferguson” and “Jane Clegg” is Sinjun 
Ervyne; Dean Inge, according to the author of 
“ Painted Windows,” rhymes with sing and not with 
singe — Philip Guedalla suggests, in “Masters and 
Men,” that a general uncertainty on this point is 
largely responsible for his being called “the gloomy 
Dean.” 
Queen Victoria’s biographer is Littun Stray-chi, as 
in church. Lew Sarett’s last name is accented on the 
second syllable: Vachel Lindsay’s first rhymes with 
Rachel and not with satchel. Van Wyck Brooks has 
a long y in his middle name. The first syllable of 
Galsworthy rhymes with hauls and not with pals — 
an abhorrent sound prevalent in this country. Stress 
slides to the end of a name on this side of the ocean 
and towards the front in England; I used to know a 
woman who crossed very often and used automati- 
cally to become Mrs. Dunnell when the boat docked 
at New York, having embarked as Mrs. Dunn’. I 
have been saying John Bu-chan and now I find it is 
Buck-an. 
James Branch Cabell rhymes with rabble — how he 
must hate to—and W. B. Yeats with skates and not 
with Keats. Percy Mackaye accents the last syllable 
and rhymes with high. George Santayana sounds as 
it is spelled; stress the ya and all the a’s broad. 
Ralph Hodgson’s first name is Rayfe. I can’t imagine 
why Sinclair Lewis’s name should offer complications, 
but I have been asked to pronounce it: perhaps some-
-P-A-G-E-177
  
WRITING AND WRITERS 167 
body fears that since his English visit he calls it Sink- 
ler, but in spite of all temptation he belongs to the 
phonetic system of Sauk Centre as yet. How Ben 
Hecht can be anything but Hecht I can’t see, a Ger- 
man breathing ch like a cat beginning to spit. Arthur 
Guiterman’s correct pronunciation may be found in 
Webster’s Dictionary under the mineral compound 
guitermanite, which was named after his father’s. 
cousin; if in a hurry, accent the first syllable but 
otherwise make it sound like guitar. Louis Unter- 
meyer is just like that, no trick to it at all, rhymes 
with higher. Heywood Broun rhymes with spoon and 
the first part of A. E. Housman is like house and not 
like shoes. Dos Passos is as spelled: both o’s are as 
in dog and the a as in cat, though it should have the 
sound it has in ah. 
Arthur Machen is pronounced like the first two 
syllables of Hackensack and these are pronounced 
along the line of least resistance. So is the surname 
of Simeon Strunsky; it rhymes with fun. I was 
asked whether it sounded like “ fun, moon or spoon” 
and could not see why both moon and spoon should 
be given until I noticed that the inquirer came from 
Massachusetts. Ask any ten people how to say Garet 
Garrett and they will make the two words sound dif- 
ferently, but he says himself that they are just alike 
and both “like the word that means the top of the 
house”: a double garret, a sort of mansard, as it 
were. Armen Ohanian is Ah-men as in High Church, 
Oh-Hakn i-ahn. Gilbert Frankau is Frank-cow. 
When asking for the works of Pio Baroja—and if 
you do you will discover what a fine Spanish novel is
-P-A-G-E-178
  168 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
like — rhyme the first word with Rio and accent the 
second syllable of the other, Bah-roh-ha, the j a dis- 
tinct guttural aspirate, which will give you a knowing 
air. I have been quite taken aback by the discovery 
that A. R. Orage does not rhyme with porridge, but 
with the French fromage, accented on the last syllable. 
Walter de la Mare, however, rhymes with stair and 
stresses like Delaware, Willa Cather’s name begins 
like Catholic and does not rhyme with rather, and 
Rachel Crothers rhymes with others. Don Marquis 
is plain Markwis, and no one should have trouble with 
Edna St. Vincent Millay, for it is a good start on a 
dactylic hexameter. 
The author of “ Beasts, Men and Gods” is Os-sen- 
doff-ske, though I can scarcely express a pronuncia- 
tion of the syllable dow that is between doff and 
dowf, not so curt as the former and quite the sound 
of cow. However, for the American doff will do 
pretty well. The name of Dhan Gopal Mukerji died 
upon my lips for long because I knew it really could 
not sound the way I thought it did, but when you 
once hear it, it is easy enough and pretty too— 
Dhahn Go-pal Moo-ker-jee, the er as in better, fuller. 
Ford Madox Hueffer pronounces his name as if it were 
Hew-fer, the first syllable to rhyme with dew. Madox 
accents the first syllable and a as in bat. These 
Spanish z’s are delicate and baffling: Manuel Galvez 
ends with the ghost of a lisp, veth being almost too 
pronounced. Sigrid Undset, who wrote “ The Bridal 
Wreath,” has a short u: Jensen is Yensen, Siwertz 
is See-vairtz. 
After the Russian Players came I was asked for

Turgenev, which is Toor-gyen-yev; Dostoievsky, 
which is Dawstawyevskee; and Chekhov, which is 
Chyekhawv, and after the Chauve Souris for the 
Brothers Zaitsev, which is strangely enough just what 
it looks like, Zaitzev. I found all these in the list of 
pronunciations in Moissaye J. Olgin’s “ Guide to Rus- 
sian Literature” (Harcourt) and anyone can find 
much doubt allayed by consulting Mackey’s “The 
Pronunciation of 10,000 Proper Names” (Dodd), 
a book that librarians and booksellers had better 
keep handy. Katherine Fullerton Gerould accents the 
first syllable of her last name. The first syllable of 
Huneker sounds like fun, not at all like prude. 
William Rose Benét’s name really should have no 
stress at all, but rather than make it Benny the 
American public conspires to call him Ben-nay. The 
name came from Spain long ago, or rather from the 
island of Minorca, and when Mr. Benét’s ancestor 
brought it north from Florida it somehow picked up 
that acute accent to which it is etymologically speak- 
ing not entitled. 
Horrid rumors having reached the pronunciation 
department that John Drinkwater’s name somehow 
managed to evade the Eighteenth Amendment and 
slide into something less decided, I called up Hough- 
ton, Mifflin. “ Drink-water is what we call him to his 
face,” said they, so that ought to do for the American 
public. We are always expecting the worst of these 
British names, anyway; one recalls the time when 
Clayhanger took on the sound of Clanger over here 
because we thought the plain word was too good to 
be true. I sometimes think there is a point beyond
-P-A-G-E-180
170 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
which accurate pronunciation should not be required 
to go. How, for instance, do you say the last name 
of Molly Elliot Seawell? Yes, I thought so. And it 
isn’t that at all. It is Sow’ll, to rhyme with howl. 
Ask anyone at the College of William and Mary, 
where her picture hangs on the wall. In the fine 
new one-volume “History of Great Britain” by 
Mowat (Oxford) is a rhyme: 
The Earl of Chatham with his sword drawn, 
Stood waiting for Sir Richard Strahan. 
Should names that take liberties with the alphabet 
like that be encouraged beyond a certain point? 
As for Irish names, I refuse to umpire. It 
seems that there have been some differences of 
opinion from the first among Gaelic scholars as 
to the exact equivalents in our system of pho- 
netics of the sounds for which certain Gaelic 
characters stand. Add this to the practical 
certainty on the part of the American reader that 
whatever sound he is impelled to make at sight of a 
Gaelic proper name it is not the right sound, and 
you see the possibilities for going wrong. My 
advice is to do as they used to do with the ballads: 
you bought the words for a penny and then the man 
taught you the tune. Get someone who has the Gaelic 
to teach you how to say Cuchulainn — as far as I can 
get it it is Ku-hullin. James Stephens has so far 
yielded to popular pressure as to put into footnotes 
the pronunciations of some of the characters in the 
immortal story of “ Deirdre” (Macmillan) which he 
has retold as the first of a series of such court-  
-P-A-G-E-181
WRITING AND WRITERS 171 
romances. From this one is reassured that Naoise, 
the young lover of Deirdre, does not really sound as 
you feared he did, but is Neesh-eh. Cathfa is Kaffa, 
Emain Macha is Evan Maha, Conachur is Kun-a-hoor 
and Mac is Mock. Though he does not pronounce 
Maeve for you, I am permitted to reply to inquiries 
that she is just Mayve, which quite surprises me. 
But if all this has led anyone to turn to the unforget- 
able loveliness of Stephens’s “ Deirdre,” it will be 
work well spent; this is a book in a thousand. 
Joseph Patrick Tumulty accents the first syllable 
and rhymes it with gum. Theodore Dreiser is Dryzer. 
The author of the new “ Life of Christ” is Pa-pi-ni, 
i’s like long e. Giovanni Gentile begins like gentle. 
Luigi Pirandello’s first name is Loo-ee-jee, stress 
second syllable. John Maynard Keynes rhymes with 
pains. The middle name of John St. Loe Strachey is 
St. Loo. I have been asked by several people if there 
is not some catch in the name Oliver Onions, if it 
isn’t accented on the second syllable or something: 
they think he must have made some effort to smother 
the onions. But no, it is as it is— though for social 
purposes he uses, so an English correspondent tells 
me, George Oliver. 
When I said that the author of “ Growth of the 
Soil” was Knoot Homsoon, an expert on the Scandi- 
navian tongue justly complained that this was not fair 
to his first name and that “the only way in which I 
can explain how to pronounce the u is to say that it 
should be spoken as if it were u in French.” Aha, 
but how will you put that in type. Knoot is not all 
it should be, but it steers the public away from its  
-P-A-G-E-182
    172 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
disposition to rhyme it with mutt. Bojer is Boyer 
and Nex6 is Necks-e, the e as in her, or like the French 
u. The veteran Spanish dramatist Echegaray is 
Eh-che-gah-reye (as in eye) with a slight accent on 
the first and last syllables. Mendoza—do you re- 
member the poem he recites to Louisa in “ Man and 
Superman ”?— jis Men-do-tha. Sound the final s 
in Barrés and Catulle Mendés, and accent the second 
syllable. 
“You have no idea,” wrote a correspondent, “ how 
many disputes you are deciding by your name-key,” 
so let the dove go forth with the news that Willy 
Pogany is accented on the second syllable, that Eunice 
Tietjens is Teet-yens, and that if you call May Sin- 
clair anything but plain Sinclair you are taking 
unnecessary trouble. Dunsany is also to be taken 
along the line of least resistance, coming down on 
the say, dun like bun. Dr. Cassius Keyser is 
Kaiser, the author of ‘Mathematical Philoso- 
phy.” The delightful caricaturist Gluyas Williams 
says he is the only person in the world who gets his 
name right. He is about to lose this distinction: the 
world is now told that it is Glue-yas, long u, short a, 
first syllable accented. You can remember it better 
if you know that it derives from Gluvias, under which 
name a saint once lived in Cornwall. Mr. Williams’s 
family comes from there but he says the saint is 
no kin. 
According to the Theatre Guild, Karel Capek, who 
wrote “R. U. R.” (Doubleday, Page), starts off with 
a sound nearer to the ch in chop than any other com-

bination by which they can represent the indescribable 
tz of the Czech. “It is better for us, and legitimate, 
to say Chopek.” Yes, and so do I tell inquirers that 
the great wood-engraver Rudolf Ruzicka responds to 
Rus-ee-ka without protest, but I suppose that some 
vocal commotion probably takes place when it is said 
in Czech. 
Marie Oehmler is Ermler; Houghton, Mifflin say 
that they have been accustomed to pronounce the 
name of Mme. Ponafidine as Ponafidine, as most 
Russian names like Suvarov or Oblomov) are ac- 
cented on the penult. Emerson Hough is Huff. I 
wondered what trouble anyone could have over Her- 
gesheimer until it was explained that the inquirer 
wavered between Herges-heimer and Herge-sheimer ; 
the first is right. 
A correspondent called this feature of the Reader’s 
Guide an oasis in the great desert of American mis- 
pronunciation. Oh, I don’t know; look at the others: 
see what the French do to Poe and to Whitman. As 
for spelling, some day a French compositor will get 
an American name right by mistake and die from the 
shock. I rather like the fine forthright way of the 
British. “If you are really going to stay here,” they 
seem to say to foreign names, “ you will have to fit 
the British mouth,” and that organ takes the least 
possible trouble. Look to the map and listen to what 
has happened to French names under British resi- 
dence. Hilaire Belloc, who is half French, has his 
first name in the pronouncing dictionaries as Eelaire, 
but his family and friends call him Hilary. Now we

do try to get the names of non-residents as they are 
said at home: witness the widespread popularity of 
this name-key, for instance. 
But I do not agree with a correspondent who 
thought that some system of rhymes would clinch 
them in the mind. Rhyme has a hard mouth: often 
it takes the bit in its teeth and runs away with the 
sense. I once read a history of the Great War all in 
verse with the proper names coming on the rhymes: 
it was hard going in France but you cannot imagine 
the carnage in the Balkans. And I cherish a copy of 
the “Delroy Rhyming Vocabulary System” which 
sets down the sum of human knowledge in couplets. 
It has a pronunciation department with rippling 
rhymes like this: 
Note “me” first syllable Me-kel-an-je-lo, 
And “ shel,” Cel-li-ni sculptor, it’s Ca-no-va (Ka, you 
know). 
Note “zhoffrh” (short 0) in Joffre, French hero, 
which ends my narration; 
I wish that I could always give exact pronunciation.

AROUND THE GLOBE 
“ What are some of the more recent books that would 
be of practical value in preparing for a trip around 
the world on one of the tours?” 
Ir it is to begin with an ocean voyage, let the first 
book be Captain Bone’s “ The Lookout Man” (Har- 
court, Brace), for this tells a passenger just what he 
wants to know about the craft he sees on the horizon 
or at closer range. Stephen Graham’s “In Quest of 
El Dorado” (Appleton) crosses from Spain on the 
track of Columbus and has a section on Panama and 
one on Mexico. Sir Frederick Treves’s ‘“‘ The Other 
Side of the Lantern” (Funk and Wagnalls) is in- 
tended to accompany a world-tour by way of the 
Mediterranean and the Orient; it has been much 
used by passengers on globe-circling journeys. ‘“ The 
Lure of the Mediterranean,” by Albert Bigelow Paine 
(Harper), goes from Gibraltar around by Greece and 
the East. “Blue Water,” by Arthur S. Hildebrand 
(Harcourt, Brace), is an especially exciting personal 
adventure, from Glasgow to Greece; it is by the author 
of a first novel so promising that I have been waiting 
for another ever since, “The Parlor Begat Amos ” 
(Harcourt), and this book has the vivacity of a 
good novel. “The New Mediterranean Traveller” 
(Revell) is a new guide by D. E. Lorenz. No 
177  
-P-A-G-E-188
  178 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
traveller who intends to spend time on or about 
the Mediterranean can afford to go without “ Mare 
Nostrum,” by Blasco Ibanez (Dutton), whose descrip- 
tions are as exciting as its plot, and fortunately more 
reliable. 
There are several general guide-books good for 
going over large stretches of this earth’s surface. 
“The Happy Traveller,” by the Rev. Frank Tatchell 
(Holt), is called by the author “a book for poor 
men,” and does take financial limitations into ac- 
count as many a less practical guide does not, but 
the ideas in it are good for rich or poor, being those 
of a man who has the trick of making himself at 
home in the cosmos. “The Adventures of Imshi” by 
John Prioleau (Little, Brown) is one of the brightest 
of recent travel-guides covering a wide spread — he 
steers a two-seater over seven thousand miles of cheap 
motor-touring, starting from France and taking in 
Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and returning to England 
by way of Spain. Frank Carpenter’s “ World 
Travels” (Doubleday, Page) will in time circle the 
globe with twenty-five richly illustrated books; half 
a dozen of them are out already and others are 
coming rapidly, so the set will be a young library 
of travel. 
Besides the long list of Baedekers and Murrays, 
Terry’s “ Japanese Empire” (Houghton, Mifflin) and 
the new “Blue Guides” (Macmillan), there are 
among the books that cover a wide territory the “ In- 
dex Guide to Travel and Art Study in Europe” 
(Scribner), by Lafayette Loomis, and two small new 
ones useful for making the most of a short time, 
 
-P-A-G-E-189
THE WORLD TOUR 179 
“Planning a Trip Abroad,” by Edward Hungerford 
(McBride), and “ Finding the Worthwhile in Eu- 
rope,” by A. B. Osborne (McBride). If you plan 
to make the tour in a motorboat, “ Sea Tracks of the 
Speejacks ’round the World ” by Dale Collins (Double- 
day, Page) shows how it was done in fifteen months, 
24,000 miles, in the first globe-circling motorboat. 
Lord Northcliffe’s “ Journey Round the World ” (Lip- 
pincott) is told in his own book, the posthumous pub- 
lication of his “ world-whirl” edited by Cecil and 
St. John Harmsworth. 
These are general guide-books; books about some 
special countries and places follow. 
§ 48 
LITERARY GEOGRAPHY OF THE BRITISH 
ISLES 
A party of American travellers wish as many books 
as possible on the literary geography of England 
and Scotland. 
Tr is curious how one author will send you prowling 
through his country and another never move you 
from your chair. I admire Trollope’s countryside as 
much as I like his novels, but it never occurred to 
me to go look at it, while I have sought out every 
place mentioned in “ Peter Ibbetson” even to gazing 
up at the windows of Pentonville Prison. It may be 
because Peter had himself not only a name but local 
habitations on certain definite spots, whereas Trollope 
himself says that in his Barchester “ may be detected 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
  180 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
a touch of Salisbury, sometimes perhaps of Winches- 
ter, but what I am conscious of having depicted is the 
Platonic idea of a cathedral town.” And Platonic 
ideas are not put down in the index to Muirhead’s 
Blue Guide, “ England.” 
About everything else seems to be, though, and the 
tourist on book trails is safe with an editor who notes 
among the distinguished visitors to Leamington 
Nathaniel, Hawthorne “and Mr. Dombey, who was 
here presented by Major Bagstock to Mrs. Skewton 
and Edith Granger.” This guide is especially good 
for side-trips to places distinguished by novelists, like 
the George Eliot country. Naturally Dickens books 
are in the lead: there is a “ Dickens Atlas, with 
twelve walks in London with Charles Dickens ” (Hat- 
ton Garden Press, N. Y.), and one of the London 
Times series of small handbooks is “ A Dickens Pil- 
grimage” (Dutton). F. Hopkinson Smith’s old 
favorite, “In Dickens’ London” (Scribner), is still 
in use, and so is his “In Thackeray’s London” 
(Doubleday, Page). There are two fine big books 
about his houses of entertainment, B. W. Matz’s 
“Dickensian Inns and Taverns ” and “Inns and Tav- 
erns of Pickwick” (Scribner). ‘The London of 
Thackeray ” is a new literary guide by E. B. Chan- 
cellor (Doran). 
The Brontés come next; Mrs. Gaskell’s “ Life of 
Charlotte Bronté” is in Everyman’s, Elysian Fields 
of so many dear departed books. May Sinclair’s 
“The Three Brontés ” (Houghton, Mifflin) and Clem- 
ent Shorter’s “ The Brontés and Their Circle” (Dut- 
ton) should of course be included. I find everything
-P-A-G-E-191
THE WORLD TOUR 181 
about the Yorkshire country fascinating, possibly be- 
cause this was the country in which I made my very 
first acquaintance with Great Britain, or with Europe 
for that matter — but I find from people who have 
never been there at all that the peculiar attraction of 
moorland country gets into books about it, and holds 
the reader. ‘“ Shakespeare’s Country” is a guide by 
C. Windle published by Brentano. There are two 
books about the Hardy country that I know about in 
print and several out of print; the two in print here 
are “Thomas Hardy’s Wessex,” by Hermann Lea 
(Macmillan), and the more recent “ Thomas Hardy’s 
Dorset,” by R. T. Hopkins (Appleton). This author 
wrote another popular book for literary travellers, 
“ Kipling’s Sussex” (Appleton). The time will come, 
I hope, when people will go pilgrimages to Sheila 
Kaye-Smith’s Sussex; meantime “ Joanna Godden ” 
and “ Sussex Gorse” and “ The Four Roads ” and the 
rest of her novels will do for guide-books. Thurston 
Hopkin’s “ H. G. Wells” (Dutton) has much about 
the lay of the land in Britling’s Essex. Blanche 
Elliot’s “ Jersey: an Isle of Romance” (Appleton) 
is a beautiful new travel book. 
There is a book “In the Footsteps of Charles 
Lamb” (Scribner) with pictures; it is by Benjamin 
Martin, and one on “Canterbury Pilgrims and Their 
Ways,” by Francis Watt (Dodd, Mead), from Chaucer 
to modern days. Turning northward there is Clay- 
ton Hamilton’s beautifully illustrated “On the 
Trail of Stevenson ” (Doubleday, Page) and Charles 
S. Olcott’s “In the Country of Walter Scott” 
(Houghton, Mifflin). The “Highways and Byways ”  
-P-A-G-E-192
182 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
series (Macmillan) are good for English and Scottish 
literary associations. H. J. Massingham’s “ Untrod- 
den Ways” (Dutton), whose literary’ value is high, 
concerns adventures on English coasts and heaths, 
with a chapter on writers on Nature, especially his 
friend W. H. Hudson. 
A “Literary Map of England” arranged by 
William Lyon Phelps is published by Ginn and Co., 
and there is a “Literary and Historical Atlas of 
Europe” among the later volumes of Everyman’s. 
§ 49 
MAKING TOURS ABROAD 
“I am planning a walking tour in England and 
Scotland; maps and the more obvious books I 
have collected, but I would like some that give a 
stranger an idea of local color, atmosphere and 
associations of the countryside.” 
To begin with, R. Hippisley Cox’s “The Green 
Roads of England ” (Doran), a general survey of the 
first roads of southern England, with pleasant side- 
talks. Then a group of delightful books of which I 
need only give the names, for they tell the story to 
anyone going that way; for instance, Darton’s “ The 
Soul of Dorset ” (Houghton, Mifflin), written to show 
the world the charms of Dorset as a place for walking 
tours, and especially welcome to the Hardy tourist. 
“ A Shepherd’s Life” (Dutton) is by W. H. Hudson, 
and whatever you get be sure to get this and his 
“ Afoot in England” (Knopf), for both of these are 
in the true steady leisureliness of a walking tour,
-P-A-G-E-193
THE WORLD TOUR 183 
which is far from pedestrianism. Then there is the 
series of “ Highways and Byways” books (Macmil- 
lan) that cover the island and were written by authors 
who know and love the counties they describe — 
Andrew Lang, Edward Hutton, Sir Frederick Treves 
are among them. There are volumes of “ Highways 
and Byways in Wiltshire and Somerset,” in ‘“ North- 
amptonshire and Rutland,” “ North Wales,” “ Oxford 
and the Cotswolds,” “ East Anglia,” “ Northumbria,” 
“The Border,” “ Dorset,” “ Kent,” and “ Yorkshire.” 
There is the invaluable series of books on “ Mediaeval 
Towns” (Dutton) for student or traveller, thirty-four 
books on as many storied cities, not a few of them in 
England. There is the series called “ The Story of the 
English Towns” (Macmillan), fourteen historical 
handbooks of an easily carried size, ranging from 
“ Bath” to “ Westminster.” 
“ As It Is in England,” a popular book for travellers 
by A. B. Osborne (McBride), pays attention to the 
countryside. “Country Folk: a Pleasant Company ” 
(Dutton) is a charming new one by P. H. Ditchfield. 
“Devon: its Moorlands, Streams and Coasts,” by 
Lady Rosalind Northcote (Dodd, Mead), is a large, 
well-illustrated book. A new and fascinating series 
of “ Romantic Histories of the English Roads ” is pub- 
lished by Edward Valentine Mitchell; they are by 
Charles G. Harper, one for “The Dover Road,” one 
for “The Brighton Road,” and one for “The Bath 
Road.” Hilaire Belloc’s “The Old Road ” (Dutton) 
is the one from Winchester to Canterbury, “ most typi- 
cal of all that roads have been to us.” London books 
are elsewhere listed.
-P-A-G-E-194
  184 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
The literature of the Thames has had several recent 
important additions. ‘ Father Thames,” by Walter 
Higgins (Stokes), will serve for history or guide-book : 
one part is for the river as it flows through the 
countryside, the other in its London environment. In 
the latter conditions it appears in a number of the 
beautiful color plates of George Wharton Edwards’s 
“London” (Penn). “Round About the Upper 
Thames,” by Alfred Williams (Duckworth), is by the 
author of “A Wiltshire Village,’ and like that 
pleasant work will serve the uses of a stay-at-home as 
well as those of a traveller; it prickles with laconic 
local fun. Hilaire Belloc’s “ The Historic Thames ” 
(Dutton) is a famous work, Page’s “London: Its 
Origin and Development ” (Houghton, Mifflin) an im- 
portant recent one. In “English Ways and By- 
ways” (Scribner) the Rev. Leighton Parks goes by 
motor to a boat-race, a by-election and other enter- 
tainments. 
The tourist interested in architecture will be glad to 
learn that T. F. Bumpus’s “ Cathedrals of England 
and Wales ” (Stokes), formerly in three volumes and 
for a long time out of print, has been republished in 
one. Helen Pratt’s guide to “The Cathedral Churches 
of England” (Duffield) is in a new edition. A 
smaller work recently issued is “The Cathedral 
Church of England,” by William B. Tuthill 
(Macmillan). Charles H. Sherrill’s “ Stained Glass 
Tours in England ” (Dodd, Mead) is another admir- 
able book for the traveller architecturally inclined ; his 
“Stained Glass Tours in Italy” is also in print and 
his “Stained Glass Tours in France” (Dodd, Mead)
-P-A-G-E-195
THE WORLD TOUR 185 
has just been re-issued, interest having accrued since 
it was published from the destruction in the war of 
so much of the beauty that it describes. “ Old Eng- 
lish Towns,” by William Andrews and Elise Lang 
(Stokes), is a well-illustrated volume about forty- 
three important English communities. 
“Odd Corners of English Lakeland,” by W. T. 
Palmer, is a British publication of Skeffington, who 
has a number of other books for walkers such as 
“Walks and Scrambles in the Highlands,” very clear 
and practical in their advice. Otherwise I have kept 
to books published here or imported by our pub- 
lishers: one of these is Clifton Johnson’s “ Among 
English Hedgerows” (Macmillan), whose special 
charm is in its lovely photographs, a companion vol- 
ume being “The Land of Heather.” In Ernest 
Pulbrook’s “The English Countryside” (Scribner) 
there are photographs of many cottages and country 
scenes, and intimate, comfortable talk about them, 
and in “ Neighborhood: a year’s life in and about an 
English village” (Dutton), Tickner Edwardes tells 
how sweet life may be in his own Windelcombe. 
“England of my Heart,” by Edward Hutton (Dut- 
ton), is a leisurely journey over the roads of Kent, 
Sussex and Hampshire, in blossoming Spring. 
“ The Spell of Scotland,” by K. Clark (Page), and 
the large volume on “ Edinburgh and its Story,” by 
Oliphant Smeaton (Dutton), with Robert Louis 
Stevenson’s “Edinburgh” (Scribner) could appear 
also on the list of books about literary associations. 
Stevenson’s has lovely color illustrations by James 
Heron. There is a demure selection of “The Poems
-P-A-G-E-196
  
186 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
of Robert Burns,” edited by James Hughes (Doran), 
with so many little photographs of places made mem- 
orable by them that it is almost a guide-book, and 
if I were going into the Burns country I would surely 
read beforehand the new biography by Andrew 
Dakers, “Robert Burns: his Life and Genius” 
(Dutton), which divides his years into four phases of 
which but one, and that of three years, was one in 
which he “ enjoyed wise happiness,” and describes all 
four with deep sympathy and understanding. For 
that matter, it would be a fine idea to read the volume 
that has appeared of D. A. Wilson’s new life of 
Carlyle, for it is saturated with local color —I sup- 
pose it would hardly do to say it is soaked in Scotch — 
and teems with incident, anecdote and legend. This 
is called “Carlyle Till Marriage” (Dutton). I must 
pull up firmly, or the new Stevenson literature will 
lure me into quite another list, and return to travel 
books with “The Angler’s Companion to the Rivers 
and Lochs of Scotland,” by Thomas T. Stoddart 
(Lippincott), which has many plates, some in color. 
It might be well to know, even if this is to be a 
walking tour, that there is a new English publication, 
“T. B. R.,” a monthly “ Omnibus Guide and Char-a- 
banc Directory,” to give information of the road 
routes, now thousands in number, that radiate from 
populous centres.

BOOKS ABOUT LONDON 
“What books are there about London, for the 
traveller?”
-P-A-G-E-197
    THE WORLD TOUR 187 
BEGINNING with guide-books, the best is “ Lon- 
don,” in the “ Blue Guides ” published by Macmillan. 
Less expensive is “ London: an _ up-to-the-minute 
guide” (Brentano) and a little one for “London in 
Seven Days,” by Arthur Milton (McBride), which 
will for obvious reasons appeal to many a tourist. 
For historical interest, P. H. Ditchfield’s “The City 
of London” (Macmillan) and Arthur Dasent’s “ Pic- 
cadilly in Three Centuries, with some account of 
Berkeley Square and the Haymarket ” (Macmillan). 
The first is a little book lately reprinted, the second 
a vast illustrated volume. There are all sorts of 
strange and fascinating scraps of history and direc- 
tions to seekers after such scraps in Walter George 
Bell’s two books, “ Unknown London” and “ More 
about Unknown London ” (Dodd), and in his “ Tower 
of London” (Dodd), while E. Montizambert’s “ Un- 
noticed London” (Dutton) goes on the principle 
that there are as many places unnoticed because they 
are seen so often as because they are so seldom seen, 
so it gets in a great assortment. “A New Book about 
London,” by Leopold Wagner (Allen and Unwin, 
London) is full of half-forgotten lore. “ Old London 
Town,” by Will Owen (McBride), has beautiful pic- 
tures. “London; its Origin and Development,” 
by William Page (Houghton, Mifflin) goes from the 
ford on the Thames before history to the year 1200; 
a famous historian writes entertainingly. The most 
recent and most magnificent book about Westminster 
Abbey published is in two massive volumes (Philip 
Allan and Co., London) ; “ Westminster Abbey: the 
Church, Convent, Cathedral and College of St.
-P-A-G-E-198
  188 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
Peter, Westminster,” by Herbert Francis Westlake, 
Custodian and Minor Canon of the Abbey. It begins 
with remote legendary days and is marvellously rich 
in history both of church and state, and in fine 
pictures. 
For intimate studies of locality Thomas Burke is 
hard to beat, whether in “Nights in London” and 
“Out and About London” (Holt), ‘“ Limehouse 
Nights ” or “ More Limehouse Nights ” (Doran), the 
sympathetic pages of “The London Spy ” (Doran) 
or the book that treats of the fringe of suburbs 
about the great city, “The Outer Circle” (Doran). 
E. V. Lucas’s “ A Wanderer in London ” (Macmillan) 
is one of the most popular of these travel-compan- 
ions. “A London Mosaic” by W. L. George 
(Stokes) touches unaccustomed themes and places 
off the beaten track; the pictures are brilliant. 
“The Lure of London,” by Lilian Whiting (Little, 
Brown), the old but still delightful “ London Films ” 
of William Dean Howells (Harper) —his travel 
books stand up well against the strain of time and 
change — and Louise Closser Hale’s “ An American’s 
London” (Harper) by no means exhaust the pos- 
sibilities. 
For literary associations the most comprehensive 
book is Arthur St. John Adcock’s “ Famous Houses 
and Literary Shrines of London” (Dutton). “A 
Dickens Atlas,” “ Inns and Taverns of Pickwick,” and 
Hopkinson Smith’s books on London are elsewhere set 
down. The war aspects of the city are recalled by at 
least two books of merit: “ Two Towns — One City: 
Paris-London,” by John F. Macdonald (Dodd, Mead),
-P-A-G-E-199
  THE WORLD TOUR 189 
and “Paris Days and London Nights” (Dutton), 
spirited letters written to one another during the 
bombardments by two young American newspaper 
correspondents, Alice and Milton Snyder. The small- 
est book I have seen about the city is “ Things Seen 
in London” (Dutton), an excellent pocket guide with 
photographic pictures, and one of the largest is the 
“London” of George Wharton Edwards (Penn), 
which has beautiful reproductions in color of original 
paintings of characteristic scenes. Leaving the city 
by water you have the monumental “ The Historic 
Thames” of Hilaire Belloc (Dutton) and “ Father 
Thames” by Walter Higgins (Stokes), a history of 
two thousand years. 
§ 51 
BOOKS ABOUT PARIS 
“What books will a traveller find interesting before, 
during or after a visit to Paris?” 
For use on the ground, the Blue Guide for “ Paris 
and its Environs” (Macmillan). The traveller con- 
cerned especially with art will find Helen Hender- 
son’s “ A Loiterer in Paris” (Doran) delightful, and 
it is one of the books that recall a trip as successfully 
as it prepares for it. For the flying visit there is 
Arthur Milton’s “ Paris in Seven Days” (McBride) ; 
if you can stay a while there are comfortable books 
like E. V. Lucas’s “ Wanderer in Paris ” (Macmillan) 
and Jetta Wolff’s “Historic Paris” (Dodd, Mead), 
that go into corners not visited by the time-ridden 
tourist, or the special guide-book by Frances Wilson  
-P-A-G-E-200
190 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
  Huard, “American Footprints in Paris” (Doran), 
which indicates every spot associated with us from the 
time we were on the map. Jetta Wolff’s “Story of 
the Paris Churches ” (Brentano) has beautifully illus- 
trated accounts of ninety-eight of them. A new his- 
torical handbook with a contemporary note is “The 
Lure of Old Paris ” (Little, Brown) by a Briton, C. H. 
Crichton, who never once loses his delighted surprise 
that he is really in Paris— which is, I submit, the 
really right frame of mind to take to this city. 
“ Laugh and Grow Rich,” by Jack Kahane (Brentano), 
is a novel about Paris in Summer, the boulevards and 
the parks. For these there is still vivacious reading in 
F. Berkeley Smith’s “The Real Latin Quarter,” 
“How Paris Amuses Itself,’ and “Paris Out-of- 
Doors” (Funk and Wagnalls), though the war 
damaged the information in spots. Grant Allen’s 
“ Paris” (Stokes) has been put back into print. 
For a student who is to stay some time in Paris, 
whether to study music or art or to attend lectures, 
I believe it should be obligatory to read A. Herbage 
Edwards’s “ Paris Through an Attic” (Dutton), for it 
will save so many wrong starts and false notions. 
Exceptions might be made in the case of a student on 
the brink of becoming engaged, for it would tend to 
shove him over into the matrimonial state; the young 
couple who tell their personal experiences on the top 
floor of an apartment, furnished and kept house on a 
sum so small that they continually give the figures to 
prove it. Unfortunately, the figures, being pre-war, 
have now only historical interest, but the way they 
live and especially the French people that they visit
-P-A-G-E-201
  THE WORLD TOUR 191 
is still as full of interest as of information. I need 
remind no traveller that by the time any book on 
European travel gets into type its price-quotations 
may have lost their value because the prices of things 
—to borrow one of Philip Guedalla’s scintillations in 
“Masters and Men” (Putnam)—may have 
“bounded like a rate of exchange when someone has 
trodden on the tail of a Foreign Minister.” 
“Tn the Organ Lofts of Paris,” by Frederic B. 
Stiven (Stratford), is by a pupil of Guilmant and 
describes ten visits to as many famous organs with 
glimpses of the great men who played them. It is 
so far as I know the only book on this interesting 
department of modern French musical life. 
§ 52 
“1 am to spend some years in France and would like 
books (in English) about ways of life, customs, 
national ideals, politics, etc.” 
As there is no country in which some knowledge 
of yesterday does not count toward understanding 
to-day, read “A History of the French People,” by 
Guy de la Batut and Georges Friedman (Dutton), 
which is written on a distinctly modern method and 
with a modern turn of mind. Mme. Duclaux’s “ Short 
History of France” (Putnam) is condensed and 
sympathetic; Barrett Wendell’s “ France of To-day ” 
(Scribner), though written twenty years or so ago, 
is still valuable as a study of conditions and still 
admired in France, and Jean Charlemagne Bracq’s 
“France Under the Republic” (Scribner), published
-P-A-G-E-202
192 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
at about the same time and showing the American 
reader what the government has had to meet and 
how much it has succeeded in doing, especially in 
education, is kept in print by demand. 
“How France is Governed,” by Raymond Poin- 
caré (McBride), is a lucid statement valuable to the 
student of contemporary events and would be inter- 
esting even to one who reads only newspaper accounts 
of them. There is a succinct comparative treatment 
of the French system of government in Viscount 
Bryce’s “‘ Modern Democracies ” (Macmillan). ‘“ Con- 
temporary French Politics,” by Raymond Buell (Ap- 
pleton), brings the snake ea to the moment and 
is another of the books that will clear some dark 
corners in the newspaper reader’s information. “ As 
They Are” has been lately added (Knopf) to the 
line of “ Mirror ”-like revelations; it is as charac- 
teristic of French literary methods as the Duster 
gentleman’s are for the British, and makes good read- 
ing even for the men with whom we have little 
acquaintance. 
The volume on “ France of the French” by E. H. 
Barker (Scribner) is especially useful in its section on 
the press, and for a study of this subject with exam- 
ples of all types of writing in French newspapers 
nothing is better for the American reader than 
“French of To-day,” by Bacourt and Cunliffe (Mac- 
millan) ; the selections are given in the original. 
A few Americans have been trying to show their 
countrymen how to look for what really counts in 
French life, character and customs ever since and no 
doubt before W. C. Brownell wrote his admirable
-P-A-G-E-203
  
THE WORLD TOUR 193 
“French Traits” (Scribner), a book that repays re- 
reading. The war naturally brought out a good many, 
but most of these have gone in again. Those that 
remain came from writers who had taken on some- 
thing of the French spirit of realism and avoidance 
of emotional slopover. Mrs. Wharton’s “ French 
Ways and Their Meaning” (Appleton) was one of 
the best of these. Of the books by French authors 
translated during the war, a special interest attaches 
to Maurice Barrés’s “The Faith of France” 
(Houghton, Mifflin). 
The American traveller, whether starting from New 
York or from Paris, will find much to help in 
planning or remembering his travel in “ Riviera 
Towns,” by Herbert Gibbons (McBride), which goes 
from Grasse to Theoule by way of Mentone, Monte 
Carlo and Nice; in “ The Spell of Brittany,” by Ange 
Mosher (Duffield), including Mont St. Michel, Dinant 
and Nantes; in the new “Spell of Provence,” by 
André Hallays (Page); in Archibald Marshall’s 
leisurely “ Spring Walk in Provence” (Dodd, Mead) 
with its photographs around Aix, Avignon, Vaucluse; 
in André Hallays’s book of towns, villages and 
chateaux near Paris, “The Spell of the Heart of 
France” (Page), and in Mary King Waddington’s 
“Chateau and Country Life in France” (Scribner). 
He will find delight in the memories of “ A Childhood 
in Brittany Eighty Years Ago” (Century), set down 
by Anne Douglas Sedgwick. Robert Casey’s “The 
Lost Kingdom of Burgundy ” (Century) is full of the 
charm that lingers from old times. Edith Wharton’s 
“A Motor Flight Through France” (Scribner) has

become a standard guide for the motor tourist as 
well as a favorite with the general reader. The tour- 
ist has also at his disposal Walter Hale’s pocket com- 
pendium, “ The Ideal Motor Tour in France ” (Dodd, 
Mead), and Albert Bigelow Paine’s “The Car that 
Went Abroad” (Harper). This car went just before 
the war, getting caught in the home-rush of 1914; it 
travelled mainly in France but went into Switzerland, 
Italy and a bit of Germany. “ Paris Nights,” by 
Arnold Bennett (Doran), also takes in bits of Switzer- 
land, Italy and the Midlands, to all of which he has 
the frame of mind of an Airedale starting for a walk. 
“Among French Folk,” by Ww. Branch Johnson (Small, 
Maynard), is called “a book for vagabonds ”; it goes 
through Avignon, Nice, Arles, Tarasson, Nismes, 
Carcassonne and closes at Morlaix, going slowly and 
getting on good terms with simple people. T. A. 
Cook’s “Old Provence” (Scribner) will keep a 
traveller in reading matter long enough to let him 
grow up with the country —and keep him interested 
in it too. I am glad to find that Cook’s “Old Tou- 
raine” has been lately reprinted (Brentano). Hilaire 
Belloc, who is an ideal guide for walkers and inspir- 
ing to travellers by any conveyance, takes them 
through “The Pyrenees” in a new edition (Knopf). 
I speak elsewhere of the Oakleys’ book on “ Hill 
Towns of the Pyrenees” (Century). Elizabeth Boyle 
O’Reilly’s “ How France Built her Cathedrals ” (Har- 
per) is a sympathetic study of Gothic idealism and 
accomplishment. Besides the various Blue Guides, 
that now include “ The French Alps,” there are of 
course many guides to sie eae districts: one of the  
-P-A-G-E-205
  THE WORLD TOUR 195 
most readable is Anna Bowman Dodd’s “ Up the Seine 
to the Battlefields” (Harper). “The American 
Guide Book to France and its Battlefields” comes 
from Macmillan, and Appleton publishes a small, 
useful guide by Summerfield Story, “ Present Day 
Paris and the Battlefields.” 
§ 53 
GOING TO ITALY 
“Iam to spend some time in Italy; what books will 
be good for preparation?” 
I nave elsewhere suggested books for the study of 
Italian history and art, but Italy is making history 
just now at a rate that is hustling the historians. 
“ Modern Italy,” by Tommaso Tittoni (Macmillan), 
the most comprehensive book about Italy that has 
lately appeared, has been followed by a number of 
books about the various aspects of Fascism, besides 
those in which this is one of the subjects under dis- 
cussion. The most authoritative of these is “The 
Fascist Movement in Italian Life” (Little, Brown), 
by Dr. Pietro Gorgolini, which has a preface by Mus- 
solini himself. It shows the movement in relation to 
Socialism, Communism, Bolshevism, Capitalism, 
Nationalism and Internationalism, and is the most 
philosophical, even mystic, treatment that it has so 
far received from a historian. ‘Rome or Death,” by 
Professor Carlton Beals (Century), is an account by 
an eye-witness, vivid and full of the picturesque de- 
tails for which the movement is distinguished. Clay-
-P-A-G-E-206
  196 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
ton Sedgwick Cooper’s “ Understanding Italy ” (Cen- 
tury), which was written with the needs of such pros- 
pective travellers as this in mind, has a chapter on 
the Fascists. There is a chapter “ From Giolitti to 
Mussolini in Italy” in Herbert Adams Gibbons’s 
“Europe Since 1918” (Century), a survey of post- 
war conditions that I wish every traveller overseas 
would read before sailing, just to get his bearings. 
“The New Frontiers of Freedom” by E. Alexander 
Powell (Scribner) is about conditions after the war, 
from the Alps to the Appennines. 
There are so many aids for the traveller that I can 
scarce set down their names. I like André Maurel’s 
so well, however, that I must put them in a conspicu- 
ous place, “A Fortnight in Naples,’ “A Month in 
Rome” and “ Little Cities in Italy” (Putnam), and 
call attention to the little books, “Things Seen in 
Florence,” “Things Seen in Venice” and “ Things 
Seen in the Italian Lakes ” — there are fifteen in the 
series (Dutton) — and to the large and well-illustrated 
ones by Egerton Williams, “ Hill Towns of Italy ” and 
“ Plain Towns of Italy ” (Houghton). The beauty of 
Henry James’s “ Italian Hours” (Houghton) is en- 
hanced by Joseph Pennell’s illustrations. Edith 
Wharton’s “Italian Backgrounds” (Scribner) and 
Maurice Hewlett’s “ The Road in Tuscany ” (Macmil- 
lan) keep their place in the affections of readers and 
travellers. D. H. Lawrence’s “Sea and Sardinia” 
(Seltzer) is as brilliant in its temper and way of ex- 
pressing it as the extraordinary pictures in color by 
Jan Juta with which it is illuminated. Norman 
Douglas’s “ Old Calabria ” and “ South Wind ” (Dodd, 
 
-P-A-G-E-207
  THE WORLD TOUR 197 
Mead), like Lawrence’s are travel-books that are also 
literature. I have spoken elsewhere of the Blash- 
fields’ “Italian Cities”; another fine work for the 
art-lover is Edward Hutton’s “The Pageant of 
Venice,” illustrated by Brangwyn in color (Dodd, 
Mead). It would be hard to disentangle the “ literary 
associations ” from Italian travel books, but one pre- 
pared especially with these in mind is Sir Frederick 
Treves’s “The Country of the Ring and the Book ” 
(Funk and Wagnalls), which has maps and photo- 
graphs. I must repeat my advice to get Professor 
Mather’s “ History of Italian Painting” (Holt) for a 
pocket guide as well as for home study, and add to the 
list of books on painting elsewhere named the chapters 
on the Gothic, Trecento and Quattrocento in H. B. 
Cotterill’s “History of Art” (Stokes) — because 
these present sculpture and architecture as well as 
painting in the text and the many excellent illustra- 
tions. For the Della Robbias glazed terra-cotta 
high-reliefs, the finest works in print are the mono- 
graphs by Allan Marquand published by the Prince- 
ton University Press: “ Della Robbias in America,” 
“Luca Della Robbia,” “ Robbia Heraldry,” “ Andrea 
Della Robbia” and “ Giovanni Della Robbia,” with 
the one on “ Benedetto and Santi Buglioni.” 
For the traveller these will also be found reliable: 
“ The Ideal Italian Tour,” by H. J. Forman (Hough- 
ton); Douglas Sladen’s “Sicily, the New Winter 
Resort” (Dutton); E. V. Lucas’s ‘“ Wanderer 
in Florence” and “ Wanderer in Venice” (Macmil- 
lan), Grant Allen’s guides, ‘‘ Classical Rome,” “ Chris- 
tian Rome” and “Venice” (Stokes), and Lilian 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
  198 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
Whiting’s “Italy the Magic Land” (Little, Brown). 
“ Among Italian Peasants,” by Tony Cyriax (Dut- 
ton), I like for its glimpses of those who are not yet 
on their way to America but heading there; Eliza- 
beth Haight’s “Italy Old and New” (Dutton), be- 
cause it mingles history and present-day observation 
so well. H. H. Powers’s “A Florentine Revery ” 
(Macmillan) is a description of Florence’s history 
from the unprotected valley-city to the days of the 
Medici. 
Sometimes a book with a strong personal quality 
will help to make a reader see what a country 
means to a man who loves it passionately. Such 
a book is Silvio Villa’s “The Unbidden Guest ” 
(Macmillan) a series of romantic sketches that get 
into understandable language certain characteristic 
states of mind not only of a young Italian but of very 
Italy herself. Stark Young’s “The Three Foun- 
tains” (Scribner) is a new volume of character- 
studies that bring the quality and charm of Italian 
life. 
§ 54 
GOING TO SPAIN 
“1 am going to Spain and would like books on Spanish 
life and customs, anything helpful to a traveller, 
including aids to language study and simple texts 
for reading.” 
Tue happiest way to traverse Spain being by means 
of a foot journey, or something as near to one as 
may be managed, the most interesting books are apt  
-P-A-G-E-209
  THE WORLD TOUR 199 
to be those that tell how someone accomplished the 
trip in this way. Harry Franck’s “ Four Months 
Afoot in Spain ” (Century) is rich in everyday detail, 
for he is a keen observer. John Dos Passos fires 
the imagination and gets into the spirit in his 
“Rosinante to the Road Again” (Doran), “Two 
Vagabonds in Spain,’ by Jan and Cora Gordon 
(McBride), is charmingly illustrated by the authors. 
Mrs. Steuart Erskine has made a practical book about 
“Madrid; Past and Present”? (Dutton), pleasanter 
than a guide-book but with as clear directions for 
getting about. Trowbridge Hall’s “Spain in Sil- 
houette ” (Macmillan) flits across the Iberian penin- 
sula, showing how life goes on among the Basques, in 
Catalonia, in Valencia and Asturias, in Toledo, Cor- 
dova and Madrid. J. B. Trend’s “A Picture of 
Modern Spain” (Houghton) is larger than any of 
these and considers its subject from more points of 
view than any of the more recent books. “ Anda- 
lusia,” by Somerset Maugham is in two editions 
(Knopf). “ Through Spain and Portugal,” by Ernest 
Poixotto (Scribner) is a delight to eye and 
mind, a painter’s progress through a land for 
which he has hereditary sympathies, illustrated 
by his own pictures. “Hill-Towns of the Py- 
renees,” by Amy and Thornton Oakley (Century), 
is a new book about the mountain borderland, beauti- 
fully illustrated and new to readers. Philip Marden’s 
“Travels in Spain” (Houghton) is an older book 
concerned with places and conditions that have 
changed but little, if at all, since it was first published. 
Neither does Havelock Ellis’s celebrated study of
-P-A-G-E-210
  200 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
“ The Soul of Spain” (Houghton) date save in politi- 
cal matters. “Things Seen in Spain,” by Mrs. Galli- 
chan (Dutton), is a book for pocket or handbag, with 
clear type and pictures. “The Tourist’s Spain and 
Portugal,” by Ruth Wood (Dodd), and of course 
Baedeker’s “Spain and Portugal” (Scribner), with 
“Spanish Life in Town and Country,” by L. Higgin, 
in “ Our European Neighbors,” a popular series (Put- 
nam), cover the peninsula. 
Chapman’s “History of Spain” (Macmillan) is 
based on the standard Spanish history of Altamira. 
For side-lights of historical fiction there is the com- 
panion to the ever-popular “ Romance of Old Court 
Life in France,” the “ Romance of Old Court Life in 
Spain” in two volumes (Putnam), also by Frances 
Elliot. “The Story of Spanish Painting,” by Charles 
Caffin (Century), is a popular account for the general 
reader; “Art in Spain and Portugal,’ by Marcel 
Dieulafoy (Scribner), for those wishing to make a 
more careful and extended study. There is a chapter 
on “Spanish Art in Spain and Elsewhere” in Royal 
Cortissoz’s “Art and Common Sense” (Scribner). 
Carl Van Vechten has written the standard book on 
“The Music of Spain” in English (Knopf); her 
literature is elsewhere represented. 
“Colloquial Spanish,” by William R. Pattison 
(Dutton), is one of a series for getting a quick start 
in speaking various languages. For a beginner’s read- 
ing in Spanish the contemporary writers are much 
easier than the classics; for instance, Pio Baroja’s 
“El Mundo es Ansi,” Azorin’s “ Las Confessiones de 
un Pequeno Filosofo,” or Valdés’s “La Hermana 
San Sulpicio.”

THE FAR EAST 
“A travel club making a reading course for Japan, 
China, Java, India and Australia, asks suggestions 
for recent books to add to their collection.” 
T. P. Terry’s “ The Japanese Empire” (Houghton, 
Mifflin), a standard guide for travellers, includes 
Manchuria, Formosa and Tibet. “Japan of the 
Japanese,” by J. H. Longford (Scribner), is a general 
_ survey. William Elliott Griffiss “The Mikado: 
Institution and Person ” (Princeton University Press) 
is a brief study of the history, customs and political 
progress of Japan, unusually illuminating. There is 
a new, revised edition of Herbert Ponting’s “ In Lotus 
Land: Japan” (Dutton) and Sidney Greenbie’s 
“Japan, Real and Imaginary” (Harper). Lucian 
Kirtland’s “ Samurai Trails” (Doran), and J. I. C. 
Clarke’s “ Japan at First Hand” (Dodd, Mead) are 
dependable travel-books of recent publication. “ Ja- 
pan” by H. H. Powers (Macmillan) is the first of a 
new “University Travel Series.” Besides the “ His- 
tory of Japanese Literature” by W. G. Aston (Ap- 
pleton), elsewhere listed, the student will find a 
treasure in a recently issued historical study of 
“ Japanese Poetry,” by Curtis Hidden Page (Hough- 
ton, Mifflin), with sympathetic translations and illus- 
trations from Japanese color-prints. As the develop- 
ment of Japanese poetry has been uninterrupted for 
fourteen hundred years, this is an important comple- 
ment to historical or psychological study. 
For a survey of Chinese history as it touches the

  202 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
Western world and those customs and traits of char- 
acter in which the Western world is interested, 
“China: Yesterday and To-day,” by E. T. Williams 
of the University of California (Crowell). This goes 
to the Nine-Power Treaty of 1922 and has a huge 
bibliography. Of the older books it names, Dr. 
Arthur Smith’s “ Village Life in China ” and “ Chinese 
Characteristics ” (Revell), though written long ago, 
have never been superseded for the general reader. 
E. A. Ross’s “ The Changing Chinese ” (Century), the 
first book to present to us the phenomena of the transi- 
tion period, is still useful, and Elizabeth Cooper’s 
lifelike fiction— often taken for biography — “ My 
Lady of the Chinese Courtyard” (Stokes) keeps 
its vitality. 
Emile Hovelaque’s “ China ” has just been published 
in this country (Dutton) in the translation of Mrs. 
Lawrence Binyon, and is the most vivid and 
scholarly of the popular books that unite history 
.with a survey of arts and philosophy. At this writ- 
ing the latest travel book is Harry Franck’s first- 
hand experiences in “ Wandering in Northern China ” 
(Century); two others lately published are James 
Reid Marsh’s “ The Charm of the Middle Kingdom ” 
(Little, Brown) and “ Beyond Shanghai” by Harold 
Speakman (Abingdon). The first is by a man who 
has known China from a boy, and has been in the 
consular service; the second by an artist who has 
embellished a friendly book with color plates. Eliza- 
beth Crump Enders sets down a series of fascinating, 
colorful impressions in “ Swinging Lanterns ” (Apple- 
ton), which goes from Shanghai to the Sacred Isle of

  THE WORLD TOUR 203 
Putoshan. W. Somerset Maugham’s “On a Chinese 
Screen” (Doran) is a set of brief and mordant 
sketches of life and character. “ Picturesque China” 
by Ernest Boerschman (Brentano) is a picture-book 
of rare interest. 
Tibet and Mongolia must have a compartment of 
their own, for Ossendowski’s “Beasts, Men and 
Gods” (Dutton), which is so incredible it must be 
true, has started a rush of interest in that direction. 
There is great reading in Roy Chapman Andrews’s 
“Across Mongolian Plains” (Appleton) and “ The 
Rainbow Bridge,” left by R. T. Farrer to be pub- 
lished (Longmans) when he set out on the march on 
which he died. Tibetan literature should be read 
when you feel cramped in the mind, and as if the 
world were getting too settled and used up. It re- 
minds you that there is still room on the globe to 
move about without colliding with civilization, if 
only you know how to pick your spot. There is a 
new edition of the famous “Travels in Arabia 
Deserta,” by Charles M. Doughty, published by 
Boni and Liveright in conjunction with Jonathan 
Cape and the Medici Society. 
When an acquaintance of mine started for Java 
not long since he took along Grace Zaring Stone’s 
“Letters to a Djinn” (Century) because it seemed 
to him the most vivid account of this part of the 
world that he had read; it is a travel-novel in letters. 
My own interest in Java is based on the novels of 
Louis Couperus, to which people and places in Java 
often impart an exotic flavor, and his select circles 
in Dutch society are enlivened by the presence of
-P-A-G-E-214
204 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
colonials or half-castes. A book that covers much 
ground is “ Tropical Holland,” by Henry Van Coenen 
Torchiana (University of Chicago), a study of the 
birth, growth and development of popular govern- 
ment. “Letters of a Japanese Princess,” by Raden 
Adjeng Kartini (Knopf), are by the first feminist 
in Java, where feminism has to be pretty strong to 
crack this jewelled and enamelled civilization. 
“Jsland-India,” by Augusta De Wit (Yale University 
Press), is the work of a native Dutch resident: the 
sketches are of the life of natives in these islands. 
The Vereeniging Toeristenverkeer of Batavia issued 
in 1920 a pamphlet called “Come to Java” for the 
information of tourists, but I have not seen it and 
put down its name for the sensation of writing 
Dutch, a language for which I have a respect un- 
clouded by acquaintance. The fine new “Java and 
the East,” by Frank Carpenter (Doubleday, Page), is 
one of a series of illustrated books that will in time 
circle the globe. “The Eight Paradises: Cities of 
Islam,” by Princess G. V. Bibesco (Dutton) are 
glamorous sketches in Persia and Asia Minor. “ By 
Camel and Car to the Peacock Throne,” E. A. 
Powell (Century), crosses Asia from the Mediterra- 
nean to the Caspian, with wild adventures on the way. 
Mr. Powell’s earlier book, “ Asia at the Cross Roads ” 
(Century), presents Oriental problems as they affect 
the United States. 
The student of conditions leading to the unrest in 
India may read to advantage Sir Valentine Chirol’s 
“India Old and New” (Macmillan), from before the 
Mohammedan invasions to after the Great War,
-P-A-G-E-215
  THE WORLD TOUR 205 
while Ghandi’s own book, “ Young India,” has just 
appeared in English (Huebsch). Robert Chau- 
velot’s “ Mysterious India” (Century) is a trans- 
lation of a brilliant French study of a strange 
old world; he makes no attempt to touch present 
complications. “India in Ferment,” by Claude Van 
Tyne (Appleton), is the latest effort to elucidate them. 
Of the older books I have grateful reports of “ Studies 
from an Eastern Home” (Longmans), by Sister Ni- 
vedita, who was Margaret Nobel, an Irishwoman who 
embraced Vedantaism and wrote a number of books 
on it. ‘“ From Golden Gate to Golden Sun,” by Her- 
mann Norden (Small, Maynard), is about travel and 
sport in Siam and Malaya. Lott’s glowing “Siam” 
and “India” are translated (Stokes). ‘A Beach 
Comber in the Orient,” by Harry Foster (Dodd, 
Mead), is the tale of an incorrigible rover’s progress 
through Borneo, China, Japan, and the Philippines; 
the kind of book that makes a man wonder why he too 
did not run away to sea when he had the chance. 
For a survey of Australian history, E. Scott’s “Short 
History of Australia” (Oxford University Press). 
For a visitor’s account of life and customs, Dr. 
Thwing’s recently published “Human Australasia” 
(Macmillan). The latest novel involving Australia is 
“Kangaroo” (Seltzer), one of the strongest produc- 
tions of D. H. Lawrence and though mainly about 
himself, with a brilliant and convincing Australian 
scene, both in city and country. A number of 
Katherine Mansfield’s stories are laid in New Zealand. 
If these travellers were making their journey in the 
flesh instead of the mind, I would add Murray’s

EGYPT 
“ A library asks for a list of reference books on Egypt 
ancient and modern.” 
As might be expected, there are so many that even 
if I keep to those recently published or reissued, I 
will have room for little more than their names. The 
general reader who wishes a brief account of the long 
life of Egypt can pick it out of the “ Outline of His- 
tory,” and Eduard Fueter’s “ World History: 1815- 
1920” (Harcourt, Brace) gives a record of events 
from the Napoleonic period to the present. For a 
small library an excellent choice would be J. H. 
Breasted’s “ History of Egypt” (Scribner) both for 
text and for illustrations, or “A Short History of 
Ancient Egypt” by P. E. Newberry and J. Garstang 
(Dutton), or the “Short History” by E. Wallis 
Budge (Dutton). The very name of this last-named 
author ensures an authoritative and enlightening book. 
The card-user in a library is always interested in 
books that combine a certain amount of history with 
reconstructions of life and customs. Such is W. M. 
Flinders Petrie’s “Social Life in Ancient Egypt” 
(Houghton, Mifflin) ; such is Maspero’s favorite “ Life 
in Ancient Egypt and Assyria” (Appleton) ; such are 
Alexander Moret’s “In the Time of the Pharaohs ” 
and “Kings and Gods of Egypt” (Putnam), and
-P-A-G-E-217
  
THE WORLD TOUR 207 
Arthur Weigall’s “The Glory of the Pharaohs” 
(Putnam). “Mazes and Labyrinths,’ by W. H. 
Matthews (Longmans, Green), has a description of 
the first labyrinth, built in Egypt; 500 years before 
King Tut-Ankh-Amen and thought by Herodotus to 
be more marvellous than the Pyramids. 
We are just now, and for obvious reasons, especially 
glad to get books that by a combination of Egypto- 
logical knowledge and literary skill enable us to keep 
up with the explorations: Arthur Weigall’s “ Life and 
Times of Akhnaton” (Putnam); the “Life of Hat- 
shep-sut,” by Terence Grey (Appleton), a reconstruc- 
tion of the civilization of the eighteenth dynasty, and 
the same author’s “And in the Tomb were Found ” 
(Appleton), a series of sketches of “‘ dynamic personal- 
ities” such as Khufu and Rameses the Great. Ex- 
traordinary interest attaches to the publication by 
Doran of the book officially recording the treas- 
ures found last winter, “The Tomb of Tut-Ankh- 
Amen,” by Howard Carter and A. C. Mace, with over 
a hundred illustrations. “The Romance of Excava- 
tion,” by C. E. Brand (Dodd, Mead), describes how 
the work is done and tells what has been brought to 
light not only in Egypt but in other ancient lands. 
“The Life of the Ancient East,” by James Baikie 
(Macmillan), is another reconstruction based on ex- 
cavations, with accounts of how they are made. All 
these are carefully and copiously illustrated. But the 
most marvellous pictures, in color or photographic re- 
production, are in those wonderful picture-books 
“The Wonders of the Past ” (Putnam), of which two 
are out and two more anxiously awaited by old, young

  208 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
or middle-aged who have so much as caught sight of 
the first pair of volumes. Prepared by specialists, each 
article is as good to read as the pictures are to look at, 
and they range over all the world, not only on the 
track of ordinary travel. “The Mythology of All 
Races,” an illustrated work of research in thirteen 
beautiful volumes, is in process of publication (Mar- 
shall Jones). The Egyptian volume is one that 
is ready. There is a little book of the “In- 
struction of Phtah Hotep and the Instruction of 
Ke’Gemmi, the oldest books in the world,” in 
the Wisdom of the East series (Dutton) which is 
generally valuable to anyone interested in compara- 
tive religions. George A. Reisner’s “The Egyptian 
Conception of Immortality ” (Houghton, Mifflin) is a 
group of lectures given at Harvard. “ First Steps in 
Egyptian,” by Sir E. A. W. Budge (Dutton), is a book 
for beginners in the study of hieroglyphics, on the 
interlinear plan. His “The Literature of Egypt” 
(Dutton) is for the general reader, so is Maspero’s 
“Popular Stories of Ancient Egypt” (Putnam). 
Maspero’s “ Egyptian Archaeology ” is also published 
by Putnam, his fine “ Art in Egypt,” a general history 
and description for the special student, by Scribner. 
The most beautiful of the travel books is Robert 
Hichens’s “ Egypt and its Monuments” (Century), 
with twenty wonderful pictures in color by Jules 
Guerin and forty photographs. Most untravelled 
Americans base their ideas of a desert on Hichens’s 
“Garden of Allah,” the only book that makes New 
York hot weather feel cool. The only book that 
makes our cold weather feel hot is Vilhjalmur Stefans-
-P-A-G-E-219
  THE WORLD TOUR 209 
son’s “The Friendly Arctic” (Macmillan). Archie 
Bell’s “The Spell of Egypt” (Page) includes a visit 
to Maspero. 
Besides Maspero’s book on Egyptian art, which has 
many illustrations, some in color, there is a section on 
the art of Egypt in Faure’s “ Ancient Art” (Harper) 
and in Cotterill’s ‘““ History of Art” (Stokes). 
William L. Balls’s “Egypt of the Egyptians” 
(Scribner) makes a good bridge from the old Egypt 
to the new; it has much information about the cotton 
cultivation problem and the modern irrigation methods 
in the Nile valley. The official record of British af- 
fairs is in Lord Cromer’s “ Modern Egypt: 1863- 
1907” (Macmillan), now published two volumes in 
one, and along with it “ The Leisure of an Egyptian 
Official,” by Lord Edward Cecil (Doran), a good- 
natured record. “ My Diaries,’ by Wilfrid Scawen 
Blunt (Knopf, 2 vols.), are anything but good-natured ; 
this and his “Secret History of the English Occupa- 
tion of Egypt ” (Knopf) are strong reading; of course 
the former has to do with much more than Egyptian 
matters. The thirteenth edition of Lord Milner’s 
“England in Egypt” (Longmans, Green) was pub- 
lished in 1920 and in the same year Sir Valentine 
Chirol’s “ The Egyptian Problem” (Macmillan). 
Sidney Low’s “ Egypt in Transition ” (Macmillan) 
explains British-Egyptian government in the Sudan 
and shows political and social conditions. Mrs. 
Thompson-Seton’s “ Woman Tenderfoot in Egypt” 
(Dodd, Mead) has some chapters on its “new 
women” that will interest women’s clubs. S. H. 
Leeder’s “Modern Sons of the Pharaohs” (Doran)

  210 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
‘is about the Copts, who form a tenth of the popula- 
tion; it has much about the rites of the ancient 
Coptic (Christian) Church. Mathilde and Mathias 
Vaerting’s “ The Dominant Sex” (Doran) has some 
bright light on Egypt as a woman-state. This book 
sets forth the theory that whichever sex has the 
chance to be dominant develops the traits that are now 
called masculine. It sounds reasonable. To take a 
similar situation, we have long known that most hu- 
mans are full of artistic temperament, but family pres- 
sure keeps it unexpressed. But if you have an artistic 
occupation the pressure is relaxed and you can and 
usually do have temperament all over the place.

NOVELS ABOUT INDIA 
“ A club devoting its season to the study of India, asks 
for novels with Indian settings, to add to its supply 
of informative works.” 
Tuts means, to nine people out of ten, Rudyard 
Kipling’s “ Kim ” (Doubleday, Page) and everything 
else that he has written about this part of the world. 
To not a few who send advice on novels to the Guide 
it means the stories of L. Adams Beck, “The Key of 
Dreams,” and “ The Ninth Vibration ” (Dodd, Mead). 
Mr. Beck is a Canadian who travels intensively in the 
East and writes stories combining observation with 
mysticism. To others it means the novels of Maud 
Diver (Houghton, Mifflin), from “ Far to Seek ” to the 
recent “ Lonely Furrow.” The famous Indian stories

of F. W. Bain, from “ A Digit of the Moon ” to “ The 
Substance of a Dream,” have been published in a 
luxurious edition of thirteen volumes to the set by the 
Riccardi Press (Medici Society) and in seven volumes 
by Putnam. 
“Caste: a Novel of India,” by W. A. Fraser 
(Doran) and “ Abdication” by Edmund Candler 
(Dutton), which introduces the Ghandi movement, 
are recent publications. “Coomer Ali,” by Samuel 
B. H. Hurst (Harper), is about a Mohammedan 
Hindu who makes the journey to Mecca and return, 
with high excitements; “Caravans by Night,” by 
Harry Hervey (Century), ranges from Delhi and 
Calcutta to the palace of the Grand Lama; “The 
Dancing Fakir,” by John Seymour Eyton (Long- 
mans, Green), is a collection of brief and unusually 
exciting stories. “Rulers of Men,” by Ethel Savi 
(Putnam), involves political conditions. “ Parvati,” 
by Robert Chauvelot (Century), is a love story of 
the present day. 
Dhan Gopal Mukerji’s “ Caste and Outcast ” (Dut- 
ton) is not a novel but this unusual and significant 
autobiography runs along like one; it begins in India 
and goes through the struggles of a newcomer to 
America. His “Kari the Elephant” (Dutton) and 
“ Jungle Beasts and Men” (Dutton), though written 
with children in mind and love for them, are quite as 
well liked by adult readers, for a thread of philosophy 
runs through his vivid descriptions of the jungle.

TRAVEL IN THE UNITED STATES 
“What books will help a traveller in the United States 
to arrange journeys to historic places and scenic 
beauties?” 
Stnce Baedeker’s “ United States with Excursions 
into Mexico, Cuba, Porto Rico, and Alaska” (Scrib- 
ner) there have been several general descriptive hand- 
books, not so detailed but making a feature of beauti- 
ful illustrations. “ Beautiful America,’ by Vernon 
Quinn (Stokes), is the latest, and the pictures are un- 
commonly good. ‘“ What to See in America,” by Clif- 
ton Johnson (Macmillan), has information enough for 
planning tours in every direction, and many small 
well-chosen illustrations of places and buildings. The 
“Highways and Byways” series (Macmillan) has 
volumes for California, Florida, the Great Lakes, the 
Mississippi Valley, the Rocky Mountains, New Eng- 
land, and the land from the St. Lawrence to Virginia, 
all by Clifton Johnson. John T. Faris has written 
several books to serve either as a motorist’s guide or 
an arm-chair substitute for travel (Lippincott) : “ See- 
ing the Eastern States,” “Seeing the Sunny South,” 
“Seeing the Far West,” “Seeing the Middle West ” 
and “ Seeing Pennsylvania,” and his “ Old Roads out 
of Philadelphia” is an excellent guide as well as 
picture-book. 
Besides the volumes in these collections that go 
through New England, there is “We Discover New 
England,” by Louise Closser Hale” (Dodd), whose
-P-A-G-E-223
THE WORLD TOUR 213 
unusual quality will keep it fresh for years to come; 
P. E. Sargent’s “Handbook of New England” 
(author, Boston); Robert Shackleton’s “ Book of 
Boston ” (Penn) ; a new and lovely work called “ New 
Hampshire Beautiful,” by Wallace Nutting (Old 
America Co.), in a series that includes books on Massa- 
chusetts, Connecticut and Vermont, and “ The Island 
Cure,” by Grace Blanchard (Lothrop), a novel built 
around the charms of the islands of the Maine and 
Massachusetts coasts. If the traveller aims to be in 
Vermont and would like to know in advance what it 
will be like, let him read a book I love to re-read, 
Anne Bosworth Greene’s “The Lone Winter” (Cen- 
tury). Robert Frost’s new book of poems, “ New 
Hampshire ” (Holt), should be read by everyone who 
knows or desires to know this State; they are salt of 
truth. 
Moving southward one has “In Old Pennsylvania 
Towns,” by Anne Hollingsworth Wharton (Lippin- 
cott), Julian Street’s “ American Adventures ” (Cen- 
tury) which followed the lead of his popular “ Abroad 
at Home,” and — especially if his interest is in historic 
places — the excellent “ Guide to Princeton ” (Prince- 
ton University Press), by Varnum Collins, which has 
delicate vignette illustrations. Coming to Washing- 
ton, by far the best guide is Rider’s ‘“‘ Washington ” 
(Macmillan), in a series already distinguished by the 
best guide to New York and one that I am told is as 
good for Bermuda. Robert Shackleton’s “ Book of 
Washington” (Penn), and Francis Leupp’s “ Walks 
Around Washington” (Little, Brown), mingle his- 
tory with travel-talk. “Richmond: its People and

its Story ” (Lippincott), is a new book by the Secre- 
tary of the Virginia Historical Society, Mary Newton 
Stanard. The visitor to Frankfort, Kentucky, should 
read “A Corner in Celebrities,” by Alice Elizabeth 
Trabue (George Fetter, Louisville), about the corner 
made by four streets in that picturesque town from 
which have come a surprising number of men nation- 
ally distinguished. 
“West Broadway,’ by Nina Wilcox Putnam 
(Doran), is told in the slang of a movie-star who 
makes a motor trip from coast to coast. Robert 
Cortes Holliday’s “Men and Books and Cities” 
(Doran) is a literary pilgrimage over the same track. 
For the high country, “ The Call of the Mountains,” 
by Le Roy Jeffers (Dodd, Mead), “The Moun- 
tains of California,’ by John Muir (Century), “The 
Top of the Continent” by Robert Sterling Yard 
(Scribner), Enos Mills’s ‘The Rocky Mountain Won- 
derland ” and “ The Spell of the Rockies (Houghton, 
Mifflin), and George Palmer Putnam’s “ In the Ore- 
gon Country ” (Putnam), including Rainier and the 
Sierra Nevada. 
For the National Parks there are the “ Guides” 
issued by the United States National Park Service 
from the Government Printing Office, Enos Mills’s 
“Your National Parks” (Houghton, Mifflin), “A 
Tour of America’s National Parks,” by H. O. Reik 
(Dutton), and “The Book of the National Parks,” 
by Robert Sterling Yard (Scribner) for tourists or 
campers. : 
The books about the Grand Canyon make a group

the pioneer exploration in 1869-70 and F. S. Dellen- 
baugh’s “The Romance of the Colorado River” 
(Putnam), still in demand, to the record of the 
wild rowboat trip of Ellsworth L. Kolb’s “ Through 
the Grand Canyon from Wyoming to Mexico” 
(Macmillan) with unusual illustrations; and “The 
Colorado River, Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow ” 
(Dodd, Mead), by Lewis Freeman, author of “ Down 
the Columbia” and “ Down the Yellowstone.” John 
Van Dyke’s guide-book “The Grand Canyon of 
the Colorado” (Scribner) and Honoré Willsie’s novel 
“The Enchanted Canyon” (Stokes) should be in- 
cluded in the traveller’s equipment. “In and Around 
the Grand Canyon,” by George Wharton James (Little, 
Brown), and his “ In and Out of the Old Missions of 
California ” (Little, Brown) and “ Through Ramona’s 
Country ” (Little, Brown) will be welcomed by the 
tourist in the Southwest, and so will be the descrip- 
tions of the cliff dwellers, the Hopi and the Navajo, 
in Agnes Laut’s “ Through our Unknown Southwest ” 
(McBride). I cannot move away from the other edge 
of the map without reminding the lover of river litera- 
ture that a fine addition has been made to it by 
Marguerite Wilkinson in her “ Dingbat of Arcady” 
(Macmillan), in which a pair of married lovers, poets 
and broke, followed the course of the Willamette in a 
home-made boat and set a model for campers. 
“We Explore the Great Lakes,” by Webb Waldron 
(Century), is another matrimonial adventure; Mrs. 
Waldron made the brilliant drawings that illustrate 
it. This book opens to literature a new territory, for 
though there are not a few books about the Lakes, the

lake cities, Duluth, Milwaukee, Detroit, even Chicago, 
have not entertained travellers who have set down so 
much of their local color and frames of mind. “The 
Book of Lake Geneva,” by Paul B. Jenkins, is a recent 
publication of the University of Chicago, a guide and 
history for the Wisconsin region. Charles F. Lummis’s 
“Some Strange Corners of our Country” (Century) 
is about New Mexico; a new aid to planning a trip to 
the coast is “ Finding the Worthwhile in California,” 
by Charles F. Saunders (McBride), and there is a new 
edition of Trowbridge Hall’s intimate guide to the 
Missions, “‘ California Trails ” (Macmillan).

CLIMATE AND GEOGRAPHY 
“ 1 am interested in the influence of climate and geog- 
raphy on civilization, especially in regard to China.” 
A coop beginning for this interesting study is with 
James Fairgrieve’s “ Geography and World Power ” 
(Dutton), a text-book illustrating the geographical 
control of history. Another text-book for high schools 
or home reading, summarizing the geographic influ- 
ences upon human activities, is “The Principles of 
Human Geography,” by Ellsworth Huntington and 
Sumner Cushing (Wiley). ‘“Frequented Ways,” by 
Marion Newbegin (Houghton, Mifflin) follows the 
great travel-routes of Western Europe and deals with 
physical geography. 
Of the larger and more comprehensive works, an 
important one is Ellen Churchill Semple’s “ Influence
-P-A-G-E-227
  
  THE WORLD TOUR 217 
of Geographical Environment ” (Holt) based on Rat- 
zel’s system of anthropo-geography set forth in his 
“History of Mankind.” This is one of the books 
recommended in Wells’s “Outline.” The same 
author’s “American History and its Geographical 
Conditions ” is published by Houghton, Mifflin. An- 
other valuable book is Huntington’s “ Civilization and 
Climate ” (Yale University Press). 
“The Far Eastern Question in its Geographic Set- 
ting,” by Professor P. M. Roxby of the University of 
Liverpool, appeared in The Geography Teacher, vol. 
10, 1919-20, and was reviewed at length in the Geo- 
graphical Review, New York, January, 1922. It deals 
with the future of China, the competition of East and 
West in world markets, and the control of Eastern 
immigration.

SCANDINAVIA 
What books will provide a club with material for 
study of Scandinavian history, literature, art and 
drama? 
Aw excellent introduction to the subject, and a book 
to be consulted continually through such a course of 
study is “Scandinavia of the Scandinavians” by 
Henry Goddard Leach (Scribner), one of the “ Coun- 
tries and Nations ” series of handbooks. The histori- 
cal literature available in English is not large; but 
there is K. Gjerset’s “History of the Norwegian 
People” (Macmillan, 2 vols.) and the study of “So- 
cial Scandinavia in the Viking Age” by M. W. Wil-
-P-A-G-E-228
  218 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
liams (Macmillan). The publication of the American 
Scandinavian. Foundation, “ Scandinavian Art,” has a 
special value; it is not only a critical study but throws 
light on the development of the Scandinavian peoples. 
This is written by Carl Laurin, Emil Hannover and 
Jens Thiis, with an introduction by Christian Brinton, 
and is carefully illustrated. “‘ Norwegian Towns and 
People,’ by Robert Medill (McBride), is a recent 
travel book. A number of fine historical novels have 
been translated, of which Sigrid Undset’s “The Bridal 
Wreath” (Knopf) is one of the most noteworthy 
books in recent Scandinavian literature. “The 
Charles Men,” the most celebrated work of the Nobel 
prize-winner, Verner von Heidenstam, is complete in 
the two-volume translation by Charles Wharton Stork 
published by the Foundation, and Gunnarsson’s “ The 
Sworn Brothers” and “Guest the One-Eyed” 
(Knopf) have been for some time available in English. 
“The Long Journey,” by Johannes Jensen (Knopf) 
is romantic history, but history in the large: the first 
volume, “ Fire and Ice,” has been followed by “ The 
Cimbrians,” bringing the story to the discovery of the 
New World. Jens Peter Jacobsen’s “ Marie Grubbe ” 
(Boni) is Denmark of the latter seventeenth century ; 
Jacobsen’s “ Niels Lyhne ” (Doubleday, Page) is one 
of the great autobiographical novels, part of the 
literature of confession. 
“The Poetic Edda,” translated in metrical form by 
Henry Adams Bellows, is probably the most valuable 
book put out by the American-Scandinavian Founda- 
tion. There is a small but useful manual of “The 
Icelandic Sagas” by Craigie, in the Cambridge
-P-A-G-E-229
  
THE WORLD TOUR 219 
Manuals, and the “ Heimskringla” or Sagas of King 
Olaf, translated by Samuel Laing, are in Everyman’s 
Library. Several other Scandinavian works of high 
importance are in this treasure-house also, including 
“Peer Gynt” and the plays of Bjérnson, in two 
volumes. Read also the stories of Bjérnson, which are 
often more interesting than his plays, and can gener- 
ally be obtained at libraries. Two plays by Verner 
von Heidenstam are in English translations: “The 
Soothsayer,” a philosophic fantasy laid in Greece be- 
fore the battle of Salamis, and a brief and beautiful 
scene, “The Birth of God,” based on the age-old 
longing for a personal deity (Four Seas). The plays 
of Strindberg are published here in six volumes, four 
being collections of plays (Scribner), with introduc- 
tions by their translator Edwin Bjorkman. The com- 
plete Ibsen is published in thirteen volumes by Scrib- 
ner, including the illuminating notes “ From Ibsen’s 
Workshop ” and Edmund Gosse’s “ Henrik Ibsen”; 
many of the plays are in Everyman’s also. “ Eyvind 
of the Hills,” by Johann Sigurjonsson, is another pub- 
lication of the American-Scandinavian Foundation: a 
strong high-hearted play based on Icelandic outlaw- 
legend and with the pervasive sense of out-of-doors 
even in the interior scenes. The Foundation also 
publishes Holberg’s “ Comedies ” in translation. The 
poems of Verner von Heidenstam are translated by 
Charles Wharton Stork (Yale). 
Of all the novels of Scandinavia — or for that mat- 
ter, of the modern world—one that the lover of 
life or literature can least afford to miss is Knut 
Hamsun’s “ Growth of the Soil” (Knopf). It is late 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  220 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
in the day to attempt criticism or appraisal of a novel 
that has swept the reading world, but I have had 
somewhat unusual opportunities to get reports on it 
from people who when they read it had not been 
readers of fiction, nor indeed to any extent readers 
at all, and these reports have shown almost amaze- 
ment that anything in print could bring them such a 
vision of life or give them such a hold upon it. In 
selecting a novel to follow this, the American student 
will do well to read first Hanna Astrup Larsen’s 
“Knut Hamsun” (Knopf): he will of course have 
read the biographical sketch by W. W. Worster re- 
printed from the Fortnightly Review in the American 
edition of the novel. Of the novels of Selma Lagerlof 
the best beginning would be with “ The Saga of Gésta 
Berling,” but “ Jerusalem ” and the mystic tenderness 
of “The Emperor of Portugallia” should follow it 
directly. They are published by Doubleday, Page. 
The earlier novels of Johan Bojer, “The Great Hun- 
ger” and the brilliant study of mistaken motives, 
“ Treacherous Ground,” are getting their second wind 
in America, but the strength and sweep of his “ Last 
of the Vikings” is sending it ahead in popularity. 
These are from the Century Co. Along with his novel 
of salt-water and the Lofoten fisherfolk read some of 
the recently translated animal stories of the North, 
“The Motherless,” a Lapland story of a boy and a 
baby bear, by Bengt Berg (Knopf), and the mysterious 
“Trail of the Elk” by Mikkjel Fonhus (Century) ; 
these are animal stories with a difference indeed. 
Charles Wharton Stork has presented to the English- 
reading public, in ‘“‘ Modern Swedish Masterpieces ”
-P-A-G-E-231
THE WORLD TOUR 221 
  (Dutton), a volume of short stories by writers of dis- 
tinction in this field, including Hjalmar Soderberg, 
Per Hallstrom and Sigfrid Siwertz, whose novel 
“Downstream,” a study of progressive family de- 
cadence, has been quite recently translated (Knopf). 
Jonas Lie’s novel “The Family at Gilje” (Double- 
day) has just been translated, a deeply human study 
of a home and family in Norway. 
From Denmark comes the great novel in the form 
and almost with the bulk of “ Jean Christophe,” Mar- 
tin Andersen Nexé’s “ Pelle the Conqueror,” the life 
story of a labor leader in four volumes (now published 
as two), “ Boyhood,” “ Apprenticeship,” “The Great 
Struggle” and “ Daybreak” (Holt). The people in 
“ Pelle” do not keep ravelling out as they do in “ Jean 
Christophe ”; so long as they live they are all in the 
story and you are intensely aware of them, and after 
they are dead they are remembered. The companion 
series, “ Ditte: Girl Alive,’ and its following vol- 
umes “Daughter of Man” and “To the Stars” 
(Holt), is a poignantly sympathetic life-study of a 
born mother, from her country girlhood through her 
life in a city slum. I am no lover of death-beds in 
fiction, but there is a beautiful dignity in the closing 
scenes of “To the Stars” that make them unfor- 
gettable. 
The growing interest in Iceland, both from its liter- 
ary associations and for its scenic wonders, will ensure 
a welcome to a new “ History of Iceland” by Knut 
Gjerset (Macmillan) which is also a survey of its long 
and honorable career in literature.

THE NETHERLANDS 
A reading club program committee asks for books for 
a winter study of the Netherlands. 
Tue Holland of today is described for the American 
reader by A. J. Barnouw’s “ Holland under Queen Wil- 
helmina” (Scribner), which has an introduction by 
Edward Bok. You will have “The Rise of the 
Dutch Republic,” by John Lothrop Motley (Har- 
per), in four volumes, and Hendrik Willem Van 
Loon’s “ The Fall of the Dutch Republic,” (Hough- 
ton). William E. Griffis has written several historical 
studies of the Netherlands for younger readers which 
are entertaining and authoritative for older ones as 
well, notably his “ Young People’s History of Hol- 
land” (Houghton). His “The Story of the Wal- 
loons” (Houghton) is the account of the first perma- 
nent settlers in New York and the Middle States, and 
his “ The Pilgrims in their Three Homes ” (Houghton) 
has a Dutch section. 
There are several short histories of Belgium in 
English: the one by R. C. K. Ensor in the Home Uni- 
versity Library (Holt), the University of Chicago’s 
publication, Leon van der Essen’s “A Short History 
of Belgium,” and Herman van der Linden’s “ Bel- 
gium,” an Oxford University Press book. The illus- 
trated “ History of Belgium from the Roman Invasion 
to the Present Day ” (Appleton) was prepared by the 
Belgian poet Emile Cammaerts to interpret Belgium 
to England, and was largely based upon van der Lin-

den’s book. Of the war records the most absorbing 
are “Cardinal Mercier’s Own Story” (Doran), and 
Brand Whitlock’s “ Belgium” (Appleton). 
For descriptions of social life and customs, “ Hol- 
land of the Dutch” and “ Belgium of the Belgians ” 
(Scribner), both by Demetrius Boulger, who also 
wrote “ Belgian Life in Town and Country.” The 
corresponding volume, “ Dutch Life in Town and 
Country,” is by P. M. Hough (Putnam). “A Wan- 
derer in Holland” is one of E. V. Lucas’s pleasant 
travel books (Macmillan), and Burton Stevenson has 
a good one, “ The Spell of Holland” (Page). George 
Wharton Edwards’s “ Vanished Towers and Chimes of 
Flanders ” (Penn) and “ Holland of To-day ” (Penn) 
are beautifully illustrated with full-page color repro- 
ductions of his paintings. 
“The Art of the Low Countries,” by William Rein- 
hold Valentiner (Doubleday), is both historical and 
critical, by a recognized authority. Max Rooses’s 
“ Art in Flanders” (Scribner) is a finely illustrated 
work by the director of the Blantin Moretus Museum. 
Charles H. Caffin’s “The Story of Dutch Painting ” 
(Century) is intended for the general reader, who will 
find it informing. 
The novels of Louis Couperus, greatest of contem- 
porary Dutch authors, are fortunately accessible in 
English, at least enough of them to permit us to ap- 
preciate his extraordinary blending of power and deli- 
cacy. “ The Book of the Small Souls ” (Dodd), whose 
four volumes came to us first, established his reputa- 
tion with English and American readers as a master 
of minute but sympathetic realism; then “ Old People
-P-A-G-E-234

and the Things that Pass” showed his power in the 
production of tragic horror and suspense; at length 
“Ecstasy” revealed him as an artist working in 
shades of emotion so ethereal as to tremble upon the 
outermost confines of words. The poems of Emile 
Cammaerts, “ Belgian Poems,” “ New Belgian Poems ” 
and “ Messines,” are in English (Lane) and we have 
not only a volume of “ Plays” by Emile Verhderen 
(Houghton) and his dramas, “‘ The Cloister ” (Hough- 
ton), “ Belgium’s Agony” (Houghton) and “The 
Dawn” (Brentano), published separately, but an un- 
usually faithful and sympathetic translation of all 
three volumes of his love-poems, “‘ The Sunlit Hours,” 
“ Afternoon,” and “ Evening Hours,” made by Charles 
R. Murphy (Dodd, Mead).

“THE GLORY THAT WAS GREECE” 
| I would like a reading-list on Greek civilization. 
For the first book upon such a list, “ Greek Life 
and Thought,” by La Rue Van Hook (Columbia Uni- 
versity Press), serves a double purpose: with the help 
of its admirable reading-lists it will take a student 
through a carefully planned and conducted course of 
study — it is the result of a series of lectures at Bar- 
nard College, where the author is Professor of Greek 
and Latin — or it will serve the needs of the general 
reader in search of a work at once of inspiration and 
of information. For such inspiration, with less ma- 
terial furnished to work on, but with a delightful 
method of presentation, there is my treasured and 
often advised “ Legacy of Greece ” (Oxford University 
Press), a collection of essays by Gilbert Murray and 
others. 
For a historical base, Breasted’s ‘“‘ Ancient Times ” 
(Ginn), a work to be included in home libraries and 
generally to be found in those of good schools. Then 
G. W. Botsford’s “Hellenic History ” (Macmillan), 
another text-book adapted to the library: it is on my 
own reference shelf. Grote’s “ History of Greece,” 
one of the oldest and best of the large standard his- 
tories, may be bought for a reasonable price in twelve 
227

228 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
of the volumes of the indispensable Everyman’s Li- 
brary. 
“ History of Greek Philosophy: Thales to Democ- 
ritus,” by B. A. G. Fuller (Holt), is a newcomer in 
this field and a highly stimulating introduction to the 
subject — though it carries the reader further than an 
introduction. It relates early Greek thought to cul- 
tural and religious life and is in its way a study of 
civilization: its chronological survey goes from the 
rise of the Minoan Empire to the death of Socrates. 
There. is another precipitate from a college course, 
being the result of work with Harvard students. The 
four volumes of Gomperz’s “ Greek Thinkers ” (Scrib- 
ner) are a library to last a lifetime. For the study of 
Plato none holds a light more steadily than Paul El- 
mer More; his “ Platonism” and “The Religion of 
Plato” (Princeton University Press) are works of 
high scholarship but not too abstruse to keep the at- 
tention of anyone concerned with matters of the spirit. 
Somewhere along here would come the vivacious 
study of “The Greek Commonwealth,” by A. E. 
Zimmern (Oxford University Press), an example of 
a historian’s power to evoke a vanished civilization. 
For Greek art, the chapters in Elie Faure’s “ History 
of Art ” (Harper), which are as beautiful as literature 
as they are rich in enlightenment. I have spent hours 
over J. C. Stobart’s picture-book, “The Glory that 
was Greece” (Lippincott), the scholarship of whose 
text is softened for the general reader by a light- 
running style. There is a companion volume, named, 
as might be expected, “The Grandeur that was 
Rome.” “Ancient Greece,” by G. Casson, is one of 
 
-P-A-G-E-239
TIME PAST AND PRESENT 229 
the primers of history issued by the Oxford University 
Press; a reader in a hurry may get much from it. 
“Our Hellenic Heritage,” by Henry Rocher James 
(Macmillan), is a history which assumes that its 
readers are beginning at the beginning and supplies 
facts for their enlightenment. 
Greek drama has a large and steadily enlarging 
literature for the student. For a single book to cover 
the most ground most thoroughly, T. D. Goodell’s 
“ Athenian Tragedy: a Study in Popular Art” (Yale 
University Press). Roy Flickinger’s monograph, 
“The Greek Theatre and its Drama” (University of 
Chicago); A. E. Haigh’s well-known “The Attic 
Theatre” (Oxford) and his study of “The Tragic 
Drama of the Greeks” (Oxford); Gilbert Murray’s 
vibrant “ Euripides and his Age” (Home University 
Library); Gilbert Norwood’s “Greek Tragedy” 
(Luce), praised by H. G. Wells — every one of these 
is scholarly and inspiring. The Oxford University 
Press has brought out a new edition of Gilbert Mur- 
ray’s translation of “ Oedipus Rex” illustrated with 
stage scenes from the production by Sir Martin- 
Harvey given in this country recently. 
For an introduction to Greek literature, ‘‘ The 
Pageant of Greece” (Oxford), edited by R. W. Liv- 
ingston, commends itself by its introduction of long 
passages from the authors presented, given in beauti- 
ful and adequate translations and made part of the 
story. I should be the last to recommend books that 
as the phrase goes, “ give you the gist ” of great litera- 
ture in a few pages, but for a man with no Greek, who 
reads English rather for quality than for bulk, this
-P-A-G-E-240

comes as nearly as a single book may to giving him 
a sense of genuine acquaintance with Greek writers. 
For further study, the new edition of the standard 
“History of Ancient Greek Literature,” by Harold 
N. Fowler (Macmillan), has appeared lately, and the 
student will get much from the “ Columbia University 
Lectures on Greek Literature” (Columbia). Wright’s 
“Feminism in Greek Literature” (Dutton) will be 
of keen interest to students of drama. 
The most important contribution to the movement, 
already strong, toward a revival of American interest 
in the classics, is the series, “ Our Debt to Greece and 
Rome,” fifty volumes, of which eight have been issued 
and eleven more promised for this year by Marshall 
Jones. These are by famous authorities and are pre- 
pared for the use of “ the general reader of cultivated 
taste.” Not to attempt the catalogue of their titles, 
I content myself with calling attention to David 
Eugene Smith’s “‘ Mathematics,” Richard Mott Gum- 
mere’s “ Seneca,” and “‘ Greek Biology and Medicine ” 
by Henry Osborn Taylor, as indications of content 
and quality.

THE MIDDLE AGES 
An American reader, not a scholar but deeply inter- 
ested in medieval life and thought, asks for books 
on these subjects. 
I mane this list con amore, out of books gathered in 
pursuit of a long curiosity. There is a sort of game 
played now and again by people taking their minds
-P-A-G-E-241
TIME PAST AND PRESENT 231 
out for a run, which consists in requiring each mem- 
ber of the circle to state, without too much stopping 
to think, what person in history he would be for a 
year, if he could come back into his own life at the 
end of that time, remembering the twelvemonth. On 
such occasions I never waste time on Cleopatra or 
Mme. Du Barry, a lady’s customary quick choices. 
No, I’d like to be anybody at all that lived in the 
middle, preferably the darker, ages. I want to know, 
and this seems to be about the only way I would be 
sure I was finding out, what people meant by what 
they did then. If it was the Age of Faith, what was 
it, underneath and beyond, in which they believed? 
Their crafts and their cathedrals are all saying — 
something. I do not insist on being a historic per- 
sonage, though it would really save time to be Eleanor 
of Aquitaine for three weeks, she was mixed up in so 
much; to be a stone-cutter would do, if he were carv- 
ing out an idea, and I could bring back that idea to 
the year 1924. 
So I have found Henry Osborn Taylor’s “ The 
Mediaeval Mind” (Macmillan, 2 vols., new ed.) a 
fascinating work. The recent revival of interest in 
mediaeval thought and idealism that crowded the 
lecture-room in King’s College, London, when in 1922 
a course of lectures on these subjects was given there 
by famous scholars, brought about their publication 
in one volume, as “ The Social and Political Ideas of 
Some Great Mediaeval Thinkers” (Holt), edited by 
F. J. C. Hearnshaw, professor of Mediaeval History 
in the University of London. He is editor also of 
“ Mediaeval Contributions to Modern Civilization ”  
-P-A-G-E-242
  232 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
(Holt), a similar collection of surveys by scholars emi- 
nent in the fields of religion, philosophy, science, art, 
and other great forms of human endeavor. The bibli- 
ographies appended to these chapters indicate both 
primary and secondary sources, and are of the highest 
value to the student. 
Of books of interest to the general reader I may 
point out “ Mediaeval Europe,” by Lynn Thorndike 
(Houghton), and “The Middle Ages: a Study of 
Institutions and Principles,” by Dana Carleton Munro 
(Century), “ Europe in the Middle Ages,” by Thatcher 
and McNeal (Scribner), editors of the “Source 
Book for Mediaeval History,’ and Munro and Sel- 
lery’s “ Mediaeval Civilization” (Century), which is 
a collection of descriptions of mediaeval life trans- 
lated from modern continental writers. There is a 
new life of ‘“ Erasmus,” by Preserved Smith (Harper). 
A recent addition is William Stearns Davis’s “ Life 
on a Mediaeval Barony” (Harper), a fascinating re- 
construction of a castle with its people great and 
small, customs, festivals and furnishings. It is the 
next best thing to grubbing around in Lacroix’s mas- 
sive French volumes. Another is R. S. Rait’s “ Life 
in the Mediaeval University (Macmillan) and an- 
other “ The Rise of Universities” by Charles H. Has- 
kins (Holt). I cannot refrain from quoting from the 
latter that in the statutes of Bologna, 1317, if a pro- 
fessor “ failed to secure an audience of five for a regu- 
lar lecture, he was fined as if absent.” 
The book decanted from the Paston Letters, Henry 
I. Bennett’s “The Pastons and Their England” 
(Macmillan) is strong stuff and to me more interesting
-P-A-G-E-243
TIME PAST AND PRESENT 238 
than a historical novel of the period would be. The 
three volumes of the “Cambridge Mediaeval His- 
tory” already published, which bring it to the end 
of the really dark ages, will be followed by five more.

SHAKESPEARE’S ENGLAND 
“What books will help a club programme committee 
interested in Shakespeare’s England, its life and 
literature?” 
“ SHAKESPEARE’S ENGLAND,” prepared by the Ox- 
ford University Press in honor of the Tercentenary, 
was planned by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1905, under- 
taken by Sir Sidney Lee as editor in 1909, carried on 
by several editors successively withdrawn for war 
work, and brought to completion under the direction 
of C. T. Onions in 1916. Its two beautifully printed 
and illustrated volumes contain a collection of articles 
on every department of life and manners of the 
period, each by an expert. 
“Shakespearean Playhouses,” by Joseph Q. Adams 
(Houghton), is a detailed account of his theatres. 
Other valuable books on this subject are Victor 
Albright’s “The Shakespearean Stage” (Columbia 
University Press) and A. H. Thorndike’s “ Shakes- 
peare’s Theatre” (Macmillan), “ Shakespeare and 
the Universities and other studies in Elizabethan 
Drama,” by Frederick S. Boas (Oxford), and 
“ Foreign Influences in Elizabethan Drama,” by Felix 
E. Schelling (Harper), including the contributions of  
-P-A-G-E-244
  234 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
Italian, Spanish and French literature and life. J. Q. 
Adams’s “ Life of Shakespeare” (Houghton) is the 
latest of the biographies, with the latest conclusions 
as to his career. “The Shakespeare Garden,” by 
Esther Singleton (Century), is not only a guide to 
making one at the present day, but a pictured record 
of garden history and flower lore of Shakespeare’s 
time. “Shakespeare and the Heart of a Child,” by 
Gertrude Slaughter (Macmillan), is for children or 
parents, about a little girl brought up on the plays as 
some children are on the “ Jungle Books,” visiting 
places associated with them when the family travelled 
in Europe and acting them for herself at home. 
§ 65 
ITALIAN HISTORY 
“A history class that has studied together for many 
seasons would like a book-list for a three-year 
study of Italian history, mediaeval and modern.” 
“ Trary, MeprarvaL AND Mopern ” (Oxford) begins 
with the political development before 1250 and de- 
votes special attention to the papacy and to the 
religious and civil tradition; it divides at 1527 and 
1789 and gives a careful presentation of the evolution 
of unity, through Cavour, the Triple Alliance and 
the course of events to 1915. It is by E. M. Jamison, 
C. M. Ady, K. D. Vernon, and C. S. Terry. Henry 
Dwight Sedgwick’s “Short History of Italy” 
(Houghton) gives these subjects briefer treatment, 
going from 476 to 1900 with particular attention to
-P-A-G-E-245
TIME PAST AND PRESENT 235 
the papacy, the Renaissance and the Risorgimento. 
Janet Trevelyan’s “Short History of the Italian 
People” (Putnam) begins with the barbarian inva- 
sions and goes to the attainment of Italian unity, 
with an epilogue bringing the story to the declaration 
of war on Austria, May 25, 1915. I have elsewhere 
indicated the books that give the history and psychol- 
ogy of Fascism. 
For collateral reading, H. D. Sedgwick’s “ Italy in 
the Thirteenth Century” (Houghton, 2  vols.); 
Robinson’s “Mediaeval and Modern History ” 
(Ginn), a general History of Europe from the break- 
up of the Roman Empire to the outbreak of the Great 
War; the accompanying source-book, “ Readings in 
European History”; “ Mediaeval Civilization,” by 
Munro and Sellery (Century), elsewhere described, and 
James Bryce’s “ Holy Roman Empire” (Macmillan). 
For the evolution of unity, William R. Thayer’s “ The 
Dawn of Italian Independence: 1814: 1849” and 
“Life and Times of Cavour” (Houghton), and 
Trevelyan’s ‘“Garibaldi’s Defense of the Roman 
Republic,” “Garibaldi and the Thousand” and 
“ Garibaldi and the Making of Italy ” (Longmans). 
There is a fine account of the life and influence of 
Garibaldi in Georg Brandes’s “Creative Spirits of 
the Nineteenth Century” (Crowell). It is supposed 
that these readers have access to the Cambridge 
Modern History (Macmillan) and to the volumes of 
the Cambridge Mediaeval History now published. 
“Italian Cities,” by Edwin and Evangeline Blashfield 
(Scribner), should be read by the committee arranging 
the course of study and kept at hand through its

development. It is sketches of nine mediaeval com- 
munities, with regard to their history and art; the 
essay on Ravenna is especially valuable. For the 
early days of Florence, Siena, Pisa, Lucca and Genoa, 
Bella Duffy’s “Tuscan Republics” (Putnam). The 
series, “ Mediaeval Cities,” published, by Dutton, is 
invaluable in this connection; it includes volumes on 
Assisi, Ferrara, Milan, Florence, Lucca, Pisa, Padua, 
Perugia, Rome, Venice, Verona and other cities rich 
in history, art and romance. Travellers planning or 
recalling tours should bear these books in mind. 
Ferdinand Schevill’s “ Siena: the Story of a Mediae- 
val Community” (Scribner) is another important 
book. Marion Crawford’s “ Ave Roma Immortalis ” 
(Macmillan) is a thorough-going and conscientious 
history, distinguished for its treatment of the change 
from the ancient capital of the Empire to the mediae- 
val seat of ecclesiastical domination. His “ Rulers of 
the South ” (Macmillan, 2 vols.) is about Sicily, Cala- 
bria and Malta in ancient times and in the Norman 
period: there is an additional chapter on the history 
| of the Mafia. By this time one has reached the travel 
| books, elsewhere listed; I cannot forego calling atten- 
| tion particularly to Percy Lubbock’s “ Roman Pic- 
: tures” (Scribner) and the books of Norman Douglas, 
| especially “ Old Calabria” (Dodd). 
Be sure that your study includes the lives and 
legends of the saints, those who, like Santa Lucia, 
Santa Barbara or Santa Cecilia, embody ideals of 
feminine virtues, or those who stand out in history like | 
Saint Catherine of Siena or Saint Clare. Mrs. Hugh 
Fraser’s “Storied Italy ” (Dodd) is full of wonder  
-P-A-G-E-247
TIME PAST AND PRESENT 237 
tales told with a convert’s ecstatic belief. I would 
even say that a disposition at least to sympathize 
with ecclesiastical legend was necessary to get much 
out of a study of Italian history, art or psychology. 
In art study make use of the fine collection of 
Timothy Cole’s “Old Italian Masters” (Century) 
with letter-press by W. J. Stillman; you will of course 
use photographs, but nothing takes the place of these 
beauties, which are rather translations into another 
medium than efforts at mere reproduction. The most 
compact and comprehensive book for the student of 
the history of painting or for the traveller preparing 
to get the most out of the galleries, is Frank Mather’s 
“ A History of Italian Painting” (Holt). It is almost 
pocket-size, but by using clear type and unusually 
well-chosen and distinctly reproduced illustrations it 
manages not only to give a running commentary on 
the methods, ideals and accomplishment of all signifi- 
cant Italian painters from Giotto to Domenichino, 
but to give over three hundred examples of their work. 
Corrado Ricci’s “ Art in Northern Italy ” (Scribner) 
has nearly six hundred illustrations, several in color; 
Professor Mather’s book, in its notes to the chapters, 
names so many books of value in the study of Italian 
art or of famous artists that a club studying the his- 
tory of art could make a reading-list from this 
alone. 
A few reliable historical novels for use along the 
way are Edith Wharton’s “The Valley of Decision,” 
Stendhal’s “Chartreuse of Parma,” George Eliot’s 
“ Romola,” Reade’s “ The Cloister and the Hearth ”; 
for accuracy of historical statement or scenic detail,

anything that Marion Crawford has written about 
Italy, and for getting into the picture, anything of 
Maurice Hewlett’s. 
§ 66 
THE RENAISSANCE 
“A study-club will devote at least one winter to the 
Italian Renaissance. What books will contribute 
to the success of the enterprise and remain as valu- 
able additions to the local library?” 
Tue single volume that comes the nearest to doing 
for this epoch the sort of service accomplished for its 
time by “The Legacy of Greece” is, to my mind, 
“The Italian Renaissance,” by Rachel Annand Taylor 
(Houghton). To the reader who wishes to sweep the 
field before beginning his study, to the program- 
committee making a preliminary survey, or to the 
student picking up the threads of his research, it has 
a definite usefulness, and to anyone a charm. The 
most famous work on the period in English is John 
Addington Symonds’s “The Renaissance in Italy ” 
divided into “The Age of Despots,” “‘The Revival of 
Learning,” “Fine Arts,” “Italian Literature,’ and 
“ The Catholic Reaction.” This you will have to con- 
sult in some library collection, but the “Short His- 
tory of the Renaissance,” by J. A. Symonds, is pub- 
lished by Holt and affords a good basis for study, 
with Edith Sichel’s “The Renaissance,” a compact 
little volume in the Home University Library 
(Holt), Count Gobineau’s historical study “The 
Renaissance” (Putnam) and for a popular treatment
-P-A-G-E-249
TIME PAST AND PRESENT 239 
in lecture form, “ The Story of the Renaissance” by 
W. H. Hudson, published by Cassell, London, 1912. 
The chapter headings of this book would make a 
programme outline. ‘The Age of the Reformation,” 
by Preserved Smith (Holt), should accompany these 
books; its arrangement is such that it can be quickly 
consulted for reference, and its style is so attractive 
that it is hard to leave off reading it. Another refer- 
ence-book is E. M. Hulme’s “ The Renaissance, the 
Protestant Revolution and the Catholic Reforma- 
tion in Continental Europe” (Century). “The 
Italian Renaissance in England” is a monograph by 
Lewis Einstein (Columbia) on this important phase 
of the subject. The third volume of the “ History 
of Art” by Elie Faure (Harper) is on “ Renais- 
sance Art.” For the period to the eve of the 
Renaissance, consult also W. R. Lethaby’s “ Mediaeval 
Art” (Scribner). I have elsewhere described Mr. 
Mather’s history. Some of the special publications on 
art subjects for this period are of great beauty and 
very expensive; for instance, the famous series of 
wonderfully illustrated monographs on the Della 
Robbias, by Allan Marquand, issued by the Princeton 
University Press. There is a Medici Press edition in 
many volumes of Vasari’s “Lives of the Painters ” 
with colored and collotype illustrations; the text 
alone is found in less expensive editions. Charles R. 
Morey’s “Lost Mosaics and Frescoes of Rome” 
(Princeton) is a monograph on the drawings, now in 
Windsor Castle, of mosaics and frescoes of the first 
phase of the Renaissance, admirably reproduced in 
illustration. Corrado Ricci’s “Architecture and  
-P-A-G-E-250
  240 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
Decorative Sculpture of the High and Late Renais- 
sance in Italy ” (Brentano) is one of a series whose 
value is mainly in the many remarkable pictures, to 
which there is a running commentary. There are 
many inexpensive aids to picture-study: the little 
books called “ Masterpieces in Color ” (Stokes) which 
are devoted each to a famous painter with eight 
colored pictures to a volume, the Medici Post Cards 
made by the publishers of the famous Medici Prints, 
and collections like the Perry Pictures. 
Paul Van Dyke’s brilliant biography of “ Catherine 
de Medicis ” (Scribner) has as broad a sweep as many 
a history; he has risen to the height of a tremendous 
subject. His volume of “Renascence Portraits” 
(Scribner) chooses Pietro Aretino, Thomas Cromwell 
and Maximilian I, living at the same time in Italy, 
England and Germany, not only to throw light upon 
three men whose lives are dark to most readers, but 
through this to illuminate the period of which they 
were products. The standard work of G. F. Young, 
“The Medici” (Dutton), traces the family until it 
fades out of history — to me the chief astonishment of 
this remarkable book is the swiftness and thorough- 
ness with which it fades out. Include also the 
“Life of Cesare Borgia” by Rafael Sabatini 
(Brentano) who is a specialist on the family, 
having served them up hot in fiction. This 
biography is quite as thrilling as any of his novels. 
Having begun with Rachel Taylor’s volume of studies, 
I have swung round to close with the volume that 
must long since have suggested itself to the reader of 
this list, Walter Pater’s “The Renaissance: Studies 
in Art and Poetry ” (Macmillan).  
-P-A-G-E-251
  
  TIME PAST AND PRESENT 241 
The best source of information on the historical 
novels for the period is Baker’s “ Guide to Historical 
Fiction.’ Not many Renaissance novels have ap- 
peared since it was published; Ernest Goodwin’s 
“The Duchess of Siona” (Houghton) is the latest. 
Dmitri Merezhkowski’s “Romance of Leonardo da 
Vinci,” known also as “ The Forerunner,” is published 
by Putnam. Dr. Freud made a study of him 
too, but not for the general public. Nathan 
Galitzier wrote several romances of the period, such 
as “The Court of Lucifer” (Page). Sabatini is 
at home in the Renaissance and had written brilliantly 
of it in “The Shame of Motley,” “Love at Arms,” 
“The Strolling Saint,’ and “The Justice of the 
Duke ” before the American public discovered “ Scara- 
mouche.” His “The Banner of the Bull” is con- 
cerned with Caesare Borgia (Houghton).

THE BALKANS 
“What books will help me brush up on the Balkans? 
I spent two months there last Fall, and want to 
read now the books I should have read before I 
started.” 
For brief and timely histories, the British Peace 
Hand-books (Roumania, Serbia, Macedonia, etc.), pre- 
pared in 1917 and after by the Foreign Office and pub- 
lished by H. M. Stationery Office, 23 Abingdon St.,

raphy that will give many suggestions. There are two 
recent histories larger than these, but not too bulky for

a layman’s library, that make interesting reading: 
Ferdinand Schevill’s “The Balkan Peninsula” (Har- 
court, Brace), which goes from the migratory period 
to the present, and “A Short History of the Near 
East, 330-1922,” by William Stearns Davis (Mac- 
millan). C. D. Hazen’s two European histories, 
“Europe Since 1815” and “ Fifty Years of Europe, 
1870-1919” (Holt), have Balkan sections that have 
helped thousands of newspaper readers to find their 
way about in contemporary politics. There is a new 
edition of Professor Hazen’s “‘ Europe,” in its way a 
pioneer. Forbes’s “ The Balkans,” histories of Bul- 
garia, Serbia, Greece, Roumania and Turkey in one 
volume, is published by the Oxford Press; in the same 
series is Laffan’s “Guardians of the Gate” which has 
to do with Serbia. ‘Albania, Past and Present ” 
(Macmillan) is by a native, C. A. Chekrezi. “ Bal- 
kanized Europe,” by Paul Scott Mowrer (Dutton), 
is an account of conditions in Central Europe in 
the years immediately following the war. “Greater 
Roumania,” by Charles Upson Clark (Dodd, Mead), 
is the dramatic story of the union of the Roumanian- 
speaking races; its chapters on art, literature, 
politics, history, have been revised by Roumanian 
experts. “This King Business ” by Frederick Collins 
(Century) gives much attention, in a journalistic 
fashion, to the plans of Queen Marie of Roumania, 
whom he calls in one place “the woman Charle- 
magne” and in another “the Eva Tanguay of Eu- 
rope.” Queen Marie’s ode to her country is in the 
sumptuous and expensive volume “ Rumania,” by 
Mme. Jonnesco, with contributions by the Queen,

Take Jonnesco and Nicolas Jurga, printed in a limited 
edition and sold for the benefit of the war orphans. 
Travel books from this part of the world are thrill- 
ing enough. One of these that covers a great deal 
of territory is “Our Allies and Enemies in the Near 
East,” by Jean Bates (Dutton), a book to read and 
re-read, brilliant and enthralling. “The Peaks of 
Shala,” by Rose Wilder Lane (Harper), is a fascinat- 
ing one about the people of Albania, whose country 
came into English fiction with a bang in Wells’s “ The 
Research Magnificent.” 
§ 68 
POLAND 
“What books will inform me as to the history of 
Poland, either histories or historical fiction?” 
In the Home University Library (Holt), a series 
of small-sized authoritative manuals, there is a brief 
history by W. Alison Phillips of Dublin University, 
“Poland.” Julia S. Orvis’s “ Brief History of Po- 
land” (Houghton) has a readable quality. From 
Waliszewski’s “ Poland the Unknown” (Doran) one 
may get enough history to understand her tragic posi- 
tion and enough national psychology to get an idea 
of her powers and limitations. ‘“ Poland Reborn,” 
by Roy Devereux (Dutton), is on the political and 
economic conditions now faced by her people. The 
first words, “Try to see the Poles as they are to-day, 
practical people struggling to solve practical problems 
—not as a race of romantic visionaries,” gives the 
key to a valuable and enlightening work. “ Poland
-P-A-G-E-254
244 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
and the Minority Races,” by A. L. Goodhart of the 
American Commission, is a report of their status in 
the nation. “The New Poland,” by Nevin O. Winter 
(Page), is a large illustrated work with a historical 
basis. 
The most thrilling way to get a certain section of 
Polish history is through the historical novels of 
Sienkiewicz — “With Fire and Sword,” “The Del- 
uge” and “Pan Michael,” and “On the Field of 
Glory ” (Little, Brown). There is a glimpse of Poland 
under the Russian heel in the first chapters of Joseph 
Conrad’s “A Personal Record” (Doubleday). Gen- 
erally speaking, novels about Poland by anyone but 
Poles are unilluminating; an exception is Clara Vie- 
big’s “Das schlafende Heer,” a frank exposition of 
the hopelessness of trying to Germanize Poles, un- 
friendly but honest. If the monumental work of 
Reymont, “The Peasants,” ever did get past the 
difficulties dialect offers to translation, we would have 
the novel that it has been said German military 
authorities required every officer in the army of occu- 
pation to read because it came the nearest of anything 
in print to a complete expression of the Polish 
peasant’s life.

AMERICAN HISTORY 
A fund with a certain sum to spend annually for books 
on American history and Americana asks what 
bibliographies on the subject are available, to 
continue that of Learned and its supplements. 
And —

TIME PAST AND PRESENT 245 
A man forming a library of his own on American 
history asks what books would be best to form a 
nucleus for a collection for a professional man 
whose tastes take his reading in this direction. 
Tue Channing-Hart-Turner “Guide to the Study 
and Reading of American History ” should be in the 
library of anyone really interested in history; it is 
inexpensive, and the revised edition published in 1912 
will carry the custodians of the fund fairly well down 
to that date. The selected lists on all topics are 
invaluable. Down to 1905 they will find the biblio- 
graphical chapter at the end of each volume of the 
“ American Nation” series (Harper) very valuable. 
“Writings on American History” is a bibliography 
of books and articles on United States and Canadian 
history published during the years 1906-1917, com- 
piled by Grace Gardner Griffin and published at New 
Haven by the Yale University Press, 1908-1919. I 
have found that the book reviews in the American 
Historical Review are the most illuminating — indeed, 
they seem to me to be models for reviews of books 
on special subjects by which readers interested in 
these subjects may find out what books are appearing 
and which of them are the ones they will be glad to 
read. Another magazine whose reviews may be read 
to advantage by this fund’s buyers is the Political 
Science Quarterly, But as Mr. James Truslow 
Adams, author of “Founding of New England,” 
wisely says, “ There is no royal road to an appraise- 
ment of recent historical literature. One has to dig.” 
For a nucleus for a library on this subject, the 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
  
246 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
best general survey of the entire history of the United 
States is the twenty-six volumes of the “ American 
Nation” series, edited by Albert Bushnell Hart and 
published by Harper. I say this from the standpoint 
of a “ general reader” who has constantly consulted 
the books of this collection for light on some period 
of our national development, and I am glad to see 
that Mr. Adams says in the Atlantic that they repre- 
sent the synthesis of our scholarly knowledge down 
to its publication, in 1905. 
Edward Channing’s “ History of the United States ” 
(Macmillan) is more recent; of the eight volumes in 
which it is to be completed, five have brought it 
through the “period of transition,” to 1848. This 
represents the latest viewpoint on most topics, and 
is especially valuable on commerce. This fund will 
no doubt have provided itself with the Yale Uni- 
versity Press’ “Chronicles of America” in fifty vol- 
umes; it is too expensive for most “ general readers,” 
Of the more special works concerned with our 
beginnings nothing takes the place of old Bradford’s 
own “History of Plimoth Plantation,’ which is re- 
printed in Scribner’s series called “ Original Narra- 
tives of Early American History” —a collection 
including such valuable works as “Governor Win- 
throp’s Journal,” the “ Journal of Jasper Danckaerts,” 
and many collections of original narratives of Mary- 
jand, Pennsylvania, the Carolinas, Virginia and the 
like. Of all the recent books on our beginnings, none 
can compare for solid virtues and charm of style, 
with James Truslow Adams’s “ The Founding of New 
England ” (Atlantic). It was a Pulitzer prize-winner.

Roland G. Usher’s “ The Pilgrims and Their History ” 
(Macmillan) is a good book for student or general 
reader. 
For the French and Indian Wars and the chronicle 
of the forest, there is nothing like Parkman. For 
half a century these books have stood the test of the 
finding of new documents, and for literary beauty and 
the quality that keeps a reader furiously reading, we 
have not bettered them. For the benefit of those 
whose knowledge of books does not go backward 
many seasons, the works of Francis Parkman are 
“Pioneers of France in the New World,” “The 
Jesuits in North America in the Seventeenth Century,” 
“La Salle and the Discovery of the Great West,” 
“The Old Régime in Canada,” “ Count Frontenac and 
New France under Louis XIV,” “A Half Century of 
Conflict,” “Montcalm and Wolfe,” and “ The Oregon 
Trail” (Little, Brown). Directly after this last- 
named, his first book and the record of his actual 
wanderings, one should by all means read “The 
Frontier in American History,” by Frederick J. 
Turner (Holt), a group of brilliant studies in our 
national history, which is revealed as a steady 
pushing-back of the frontier from one ocean to the 
other. I read it at the same time as “ Main Street,” 
and found that it sharpened the sting of that novel. 
Professor Turner’s little book, a collection of essays, 
has become one of the formative influences in current 
historical writing, and no reader interested at all in 
our history can afford to pass it by any more than 
Mr. Adams’s “ Founding of New England.” 
Our historians are not satisfied with the treatment
-P-A-G-E-258

of the Revolution in historical literature. The most 
readable and indeed one of the most readable of books, 
is Sir George O. Trevelyan’s “The American Revolu- 
tion” (Longmans) in four volumes, but it is now 
considered weak on military matters. The best mili- 
tary account is in the third volume of Fortescue’s 
“History of the British Army,” but like all For- 
tescue’s writings it is marred by his unreasoning 
antipathy to all Americans. “The American Revolu- 
tion,” by H. E. Egerton (Oxford), is a new attempt 
to assign a cause without prejudice. S. G. Fisher’s 
“Struggle for American Independence” (Lippincott, 
2 vols.) is red-hot in his opposition to anything Eng- 
lish, but on the whole it is as suggestive as any. 
The only book that traces the local, rather than 
the imperial, discontents back to about 1763 is 
the recently published “Revolutionary New Eng- 
land,” by James Truslow Adams (Atlantic), which 
takes an almost untouched field. 
The War of 1812, for obvious reasons, has not at- 
tracted our historians. Its best aspects were on the 
sea and the best account there is Admiral Mahan’s 
“Sea Power in its Relations to the War of 1812” 
(Little, Brown, 2 vols.). For the colonial period, Pit- 
man’s excellent “ Development of the British West 
Indies ” (Yale University Press) will serve to focus 
attention on that important sphere with reference to 
ourselves. 
The biographies of Americans without which any 
American library is incomplete are Lord Charnwood’s 
“Abraham Lincoln” (Holt) and Albert Beveridge’s 
“Life of John Marshall” (Houghton, 4 vols.). To
-P-A-G-E-259
    
TIME PAST AND PRESENT 249 
these Franklin’s “Autobiography” (Everymans) 
should be added, and F. S. Oliver’s “ Alexander 
Hamilton ” (Putnam). 
For the war with Mexico there is the fine “ War 
With Mexico,” by Justin H. Smith (Macmillan, 2 
vols.). For the whole period of the Civil War there 
is nothing like the “ History of the United States ” 
by James Ford Rhodes (Macmillan) — the first seven 
volumes, to 1877. For the last half-century “ Recent 
History of the United States,” by Frederick L. Pax- 
son (Houghton), is the most satisfactory on the 
whole; this is also published in a school edition. 
Paxson’s “The Civil War” is a small volume in the 
Home University Library. A new and absorbingly 
interesting literature is growing up around the de- 
velopment of the West; it calls for a reading-list of 
its own for as yet no one book attempts to cover it, 
save as it is in “The Trans-Mississippi-West ” by 
Cardinal Goodwin (Appleton), which begins with the 
acquisition of Louisiana in 1803 and ends with the 
Gadsden purchase fifty years later. “A History of 
American Political Theories,” by Charles E. Merriam 
(Macmillan), gives a good account of this aspect of 
our history, and the best survey of “American 
Thought: from Puritanism to Pragmatism and 
Beyond” that a thoughtful student of our national 
life can make is through the book of that name by 
Woodbridge Riley (Holt).

INDUSTRIAL HISTORY AND COMMERCIAL 
GEOGRAPHY 
“Tell me several books on the industrial history of 
the United States and on commercial geography.” 
“A History or MANUFACTURES IN THE UNITED 
States,” by Victor Selden Clark, one of the Carnegie 
publications, is a work praised by high authorities. 
It goes from 1607 to 1860, and a second volume is 
promised. Another scholarly and authoritative work 
is Charles Manfred Thompson’s “History of the 
United States, Political, Industrial, Social,” published 
by Sanborn; this follows the general arrangement of 
“ Readings in the Economic History of the United 
States,” by Bogart and Thompson, and devotes a 
quarter of its space to the time before 1789, half to 
the period 1789-1865, and the rest to the time since. 
One of the publications of the University of Chicago, 
Rolla M. Tryon’s “ Household Manufacturing in the 
United States,” a smaller book, can be used for refer- 
ence by teachers of history or by teachers of domestic 
arts and sciences; it has good tables, index, and book 
lists. 
“The Age of Big Business,” by Burton Hendrick, 
one of the volumes in the Yale Press “ Chronicles of 
America,” is a series of studies of captains of industry, 
written in a popular vein. Robert M. Keir’s “ Manu- 
facturing Industries in America,” intended as a state- 
ment of fundamental economic factors (Ronald), 
was prepared for the business man or for students of 
 
-P-A-G-E-261
TIME PAST AND PRESENT 251 
the economics of business; its best point is economic 
geography. For the grammar or junior high school 
student there is E. F. Fisher’s “ Resources and Indus- 
tries of the United States” (Ginn). 
I find that a useful book for the general reader 
asking for information on the development of our 
industrial activities is a school text issued by Mac- 
millan, Louis Ray Wells’s “ Industrial History of the 
United States ”; it has pictures, indicates subjects for 
discussion, debate, and further study, and provides 
with each chapter a carefully selected reading list. 
“Industrial and Commercial Geography,” by J. R. 
Smith (Holt), is the standard work on the subject 
written in America; it is by the foremost American 
authority on commercial geography. The “ Hand- 
book of Commercial Geography,” by G. C. Chisholm 
(Longmans), has been for many years and in various 
editions the standard English work.

WHAT THEY THINK OF US 
“TI am interested in recent reactions of resident 
foreign-born of various racial stocks to the con- 
ditions of life in America; I have read Bok’s books, 
Lewisohn’s “Up Stream,” Steiner's “ From Alien 
to Citizen” and “ Introducing the American Spirit,” 
Rihbany’s “ A Far Journey,” Riis’s “ Making of an 
American,” M. E. Ravage’s “ An American in the 
Making” and the books of Mary Antin. I prefer 
sound or even violent criticism to sugary praise.”
-P-A-G-E-262
252 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
Micury little sugar we get on our criticisms nowa- 
days, native or foreign. If you need pepper, there’s 
plenty in Elizabeth Hasanovitz’s “One of Them” 
(Houghton, Mifflin), and Rose Cohen’s “ Out of the 
Shadow ” (Doran) has been praised by every strug- 
gling young newcomer whose advice I have asked on 
this matter — and scarce one of these, by the way, 
had a good word to say for the books of Mary Antin. 
The successes speak well of us in “ American Spirit in 
the Writings of Americans of Foreign Birth,” a selec- 
tion made by Robert Stauffer (Christopher). The 
Atlantic Monthly Press issues “ Americans by Adop- 
tion,’ a group of biographies of men like Girard, 
Ericsson, Agassiz, J. J. Hill, Carnegie and Saint 
Gaudens. 
To get a good start on such a study of reactions 
read the sound and brilliant study of the process of 
naturalization and just what it means to a foreign- 
born would-be citizen, “Americans by Choice,” by 
John P. Gavit. It is one of the outstanding volumes 
of the Americanization Series (Harper) that I have 
constant occasion to recommend. The statistics in it 
are carefully compiled and tell a great deal. Three 
recently published personal records stand out: “Caste 
and Outcast,” by Dhan Gopal Mukerji (Dutton), else- 
where noted, in which a Hindu’s experience with the 
New World is set forth, “The Soul of an Immigrant,” 
by Constantine Panunzio (Macmillan), and “ David 
Lubin: a Study in Practical Idealism,” by Olivia 
Agresti (Little), a high record of spiritual life. From 
Mr. Panunzio’s moving story of an Italian’s struggle 
to make for himself a place in our life one comes to
-P-A-G-E-263
TIME PAST AND PRESENT 253 
the somewhat rueful conviction that if an immigrant 
can go through all that and still want to be—and 
love to be — an American, as he does, there must be 
something about us. David Lubin, born of poor folk 
in Russian Poland, taught only until twelve in New 
York public schools, lived to found the International 
Institute of Agriculture at Rome, having proved his 
“ practical ” qualities by making an American fortune. 
There is a letter on page 162 to a pupil telling her 
just what the pay of idealism will be that goes to the 
heights and depths of the subject. 
Nevins’s “ American Social History as Recorded by 
British Travellers ” (Holt) is bound to interest any- 
one reading along these lines. Then after all these 
read Carl Brigham’s “Study of American Intelli- 
gence” (Princeton University Press) to see what he 
has to show about problems of national progress and 
welfare involved in immigration; a thought-provoking 
book.

NEW ENGLAND LIFE AND LETTERS 
A literary club planning a course of study on “ Life 
and Letters in New England” asks for books on 
history, antiquities, customs and so on, and for 
suggestions on novels and short stories presenting 
past days in New England. 
“Tue Founpinc or New ENctanp,” by James 
Truslow Adams (Atlantic), sets a pace so swift that 
I am glad he keeps up with it in “ Revolutionary 
New England: 1690-1776” (Atlantic), and promises
-P-A-G-E-264
254 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
in the course of time, a third volume to be a social 
and economic history of the colonies. Read by all 
means the “Maritime History of Massachusetts: 
1783-1860,” by Samuel Eliot Morison (Houghton) ; 
the staid title gives no hint of what a dashing book 
it is. Readers from the uitlands must bear in mind 
that while these old New Englanders had stern inhibi- 
tions, they were continually breaking loose from them 
and, like the monk of Siberia, when they broke from 
their cells they made some considerable excitement. 
For instance, “ Tales of an Old Sea Port,” by Wil- 
fred Munro (Princeton), is wild true adventures of 
men who set out from Bristol, R. I., a hundred years 
ago. Hergesheimer’s “Java Head” (Knopf) is an 
extraordinary evocation of old Salem, in which, as 
Mr. Van Doren points out in “ Contemporary Ameri- 
can Novelists” (Macmillan), against the exotic 
Manchu aristocrat, “Old” Salem is suddenly re- 
vealed as raw and new. “The Middle Passage,” by 
Daniel Chase (Macmillan), does an important piece of 
reconstruction for an unnamed seaport that I suspect 
to be New Bedford, in the ’50’s. The standard history 
of “ The English Colonies in America,” by J. A. Doyle 
(Holt), an authoritative and comprehensive work, de- 
votes two of its volumes to “ The Puritan Colonies.” 
Another history of the period is John A. Goodwin’s 
“The Puritan Republic” (Houghton). 
I will not attempt to choose among the books pub- 
lished in celebration of the Tercentenary save to say 
that “Towns of New England and Old England, 
Treland and Scotland” (Putnam) has no competitor
-P-A-G-E-265
TIME PAST AND PRESENT 255 
in its field. It shows the connecting links between 
cities and towns here and those in the old country for 
which they were named, with many photographs, and 
I have spent hours before and after motor trips in 
New England, poking about in its two volumes to 
find bits about the other Woodstock, the original 
Boston, the source of our fifteen Medfords, and so on. 
There is a beautiful new book about “ Gloucester by 
Land and Sea” (Little, Brown), by Charles Board- 
man Hawes, with pen and ink drawings by Lester 
Hornby; it is from the author of the spirited sea 
novels “The Great Quest” and “The Mutineers.” 
Before that were two excellent books on the Cape, 
“Old Cape Cod: the Land, the Men, the Sea,” by 
Mary Bangs (Houghton), and Albert Perry Brig- 
ham’s “ Cape Cod and the Old Colony ” (Putnam), 
which I have had several times to retrieve from 
unscrupulous and appreciative friends with Cape Cod 
antecedents. 
I thought I would have to send out storm signals 
that psychoanalysis had reached the founders of this 
Republic, when I heard that the recently published 
biography, “ Samuel Adams,” by Ralph Volney Har- 
low of Boston University (Holt), not only concerned 
itself particularly with revolutionary processes but 
applied to them the methods of modern psychology. 
The Signers have, however, no cause to call for their 
Ouija boards and get out an injunction; the book 
is a sober contribution to our understanding of the 
politics and indeed the literature of our post-Revolu- 
tionary days, when we were all of us more or less
-P-A-G-E-266
  256 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
concerned with working out our emotional reactions 
in passionate— though generally unconscious — 
propaganda. 
Alice Morse Earle’s books are charming reading and 
useful for such a course as this; they have been lately 
brought back into print: “Home Life in Colonial 
Days,” “Child Life in Colonial Days,” “Old 
Time Gardens,” and especially “Stage Coach and 
Tavern Days” (Macmillan). “Turnpikes of New 
England,” by Frederick J. Wood (Marshall Jones), 
is a large book with everything anyone might 
want to know about what happened along these his- 
toric thoroughfares and pictures that make you long 
to get on them again. J. R. Simmons’s “ Historic 
Trees of Massachusetts ” (Marshall Jones) is another 
unusual book. “Boston Common,’ by M. A. 
DeWolfe Howe (Atlantic), is a history to the present 
time. “Rambles about Old Boston,” by Edwin 
Bacon (Little), is a historic guide-book, and there is 
a Robert Shackleton “ Book of Boston” (Penn) in 
his series on the cities. ‘ Romantic Days in Old 
Boston,” by Mary C. Crawford (Little), and her 
new “Famous Families of New England,” “ Mem- 
ories of a Hostess,” by M. A. Wolfe Howe (Atlantic), 
and Caroline Ticknor’s “Glimpses of Authors” 
(Houghton), pleasantly bring back the nationally and 
locally great. Mary Northend’s “ Historic Homes of 
New England” (Little) has fine pictures. Kate 
Ryan’s “Old Boston Museum Days” (Little) 
belongs to theatrical history; why, I can remember 
myself when some of the stuffed animals that took 
the curse off the drama still ornamented the lobby
-P-A-G-E-267

of the Boston Museum, though they were pretty 
mangy by the time I began to visit Boston. 
Dorothy Canfield’s “Raw Material” (Harcourt) 
is far more careful workmanship than its title would 
indicate. Some of the reviewers, evidently not from 
New England, seem to think she is finding fault with 
her forbears in her unvarnished portraits of old-time 
Vermonters. Why, when a Vermonter describes his 
own or his neighbor’s cussedness, whatever he says 
about it, don’t make the mistake of thinking he is con- 
fessing. He is boasting. I have always thought her 
collection of short stories, “ Hillsboro People ” (Holt), 
was her best work, and the one about the bedquilt 
one of the best stories of New England character. For 
real rock-bound poetry with the breath of blueberries 
and brakes and ripening everlasting-flowers, there is 
nothing like Robert Frost; “North of Boston,” 
“Mountain Interval” and his remarkable new 
volume, “ New Hampshire” (Holt). 
Raymond Weaver, in his “Herman Melville: 
Mariner and Mystic” (Doran), says snappishly that 
Barrett Wendell’s “Literary History of America” 
(Scribner) tucks American literature neatly into the 
‘confines of Harvard College; believe that or not, it 
is certainly a good book for New England’s golden 
age. A new book for high schools, J. L. Haney’s 
“Story of Our Literature ” (Scribner), will be useful 
in arranging a course of reading and its book-lists 
are large and well-chosen. I content myself with 
adding only Ethel Kelley’s “ Heart’s Blood” (Knopf), 
a recent New England novel, Meade Minnegerode’s 
“Seven Hills” (Putnam), for a treatment in fiction
-P-A-G-E-268
  258 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
of the approach of the barbarians— foreign and 
native — upon the Capitoline heights of New England 
aristocracy, and the play that no New England list 
can afford to omit, Owen Davis’s “Ice Bound ” 
(Little). If “ Ghosts ” were not known to the general 
public almost exclusively by its medical or pseudo- 
medical features, I would say that “ Ice Bound ” re- 
minds me more of “ Ghosts” than any play that has 
appeared since Ibsen. For the real leading character 
of the Norwegian play is the late Captain Alving, and 
the moral is contained in the reasons why he went 
wrong. These reasons are the same ones that so 
nearly wrecked Mr. Davis’s young man— and they 
are strong enough to make the sober ending of “ Ice- 
bound ” a fine piece of honest realism. 
§ 73 
MAKERS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
A club studying “ Makers of the Nineteenth Century” 
asks for a list of “ twenty or more men and women 
to each of whom the twentieth century owes an 
hour’s talk and several hours study” with the books 
by which this study may be furthered. 
Tue series of biographies called “ Makers of the 
Nineteenth Century ” (Holt) gives such a list a good 
start: every volume on it is well worth reading and 
some of them are magnificent. They are “ Abraham 
Lincoln,’ by Lord Charnwood; “ Delane of the 
Times,” by Sir Edward Cook; “ Abdul Hamid,” by 
Sir Edwin Pears; “ Herbert Spencer,” by Hugh Elliot ; 
“Porfirio Diaz,’ by David Hannay; “Li Hung
-P-A-G-E-269

Chang,” by J. O. P. Bland; “ Bismarck,” by C. G. 
Robertson; “Victor Hugo,” by Marie Duclaux; 
“Cecil Rhodes,” by Basil Williams; “ Moltke,” by 
F. E. Whitton. 
Keeping this line of direction I come upon these: 
“Queen Victoria,” by Lytton Strachey (Harcourt). 
The Dowager Empress Tzu-Hsi, whose extraordinary 
character and career are woven into the recent book 
about “China: Yesterday and To-day,” by E. T. 
Williams (Crowell). Napoleon of the Second Empire, 
of whom Walter Geer writes at length in “ Napoleon 
III: the Romance of an Emperor” (Brentano). 
Disraeli, whose biography, the vast and valuable 
“ Life of Benjamin Disraeli ” (Macmillan), by Mony- 
penny and Buckle, is really a history of his times. 
Gladstone; although his best biographies are out of 
print, they are in many libraries. These are the 
short one by James Bryce (Century, 1898) and the 
long one by John Morley (Macmillan, 1903), each in 
its way a masterpiece. Cavour, whose standard biog- 
raphy is “The Life and Times of Cavour,” by 
William R. Thayer (Houghton). Chief-Justice Mar- 
shall, for whose life and times we have one of the 
finest biographies produced in America, Albert Bever- 
idge’s “ Life of John Marshall” (Houghton). Robert 
Fulton, of whom Mrs. Alice Sutcliffe has written 
a life, “ Robert Fulton” (Macmillan), intended for 
young people but authoritative enough to suit 
readers of any age. Charles Darwin, whose “ Life and 
Letters,” edited by his son, Francis Darwin, includes 
an autobiographical chapter (Appleton). With this 
read “The Influence of Darwin on Philosophy,” by
-P-A-G-E-270
  260° A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
John Dewey (Holt). Karl Marx, of whom, the 
first adequate biography, prepared largely from origi- 
nal investigations with the assistance of Marx’s 
daughter and friends, is John Spargo’s “ Karl Marx: 
His Life and Work” (Huebsch). William Booth of 
the Salvation Army, whose two-volume biography is 
Howard Begbie’s “ Life of General William Booth ” 
(Macmillan). Anatole France: there are several 
approaches to a biography of him already, although 
he steadily refuses to supply the material for 
the concluding pages of one. I like especially the 
little book “Anatole France” in the “Writers of 
the Day” series (Holt), for it is by W. L. George, 
who has temperamental and cultural qualifications 
for writing it. The latest addition to France litera- 
ture is the invaluable “ Opinions of Anatole France,” 
gathered by Paul Gsell (Knopf). Lyof Tolstoy, for 
whom there are several life-studies in English: Aylmer 
Maude’s “Leo Tolstoy” (Dodd), an entirely re- 
written condensation of the two-volume life, Romain 
Rolland’s “Tolstoy” (Dutton), and the “Life of 
Tolstoy,” by Nathan Haskell Dole (Crowell), to 
which I would add the “Reminiscences of Leo 
Nikolaevitch Tolstoy,” by Maxim Gorky (Huebsch), 
and the latest contribution to Tolstoyiana, the long- 
deferred “ Autobiography ” of Countess Sophie An- 
dreevna Tolstoy (Huebsch). His son Ilya Tolstoy’s 
“ Reminiscences of Tolstoy ” (Century) are intimate 
and homely. And for a concluding entry, either Curié 
or Pasteur, who have fared better than most scientists 
in the way of biographies, for we have in English not 
only the fine “Life of Pasteur,” by Vallery-Radot
-P-A-G-E-271
  
TIME PAST AND PRESENT 261 
(Doubleday), but also “ Pasteur and his Work,” by 
Dr. Descour (Stokes), a biography with the story of 
his many scientific discoveries, and “Pasteur and 
After Pasteur,” by Stephen Paget (Macmillan), a 
life which also has sketches of the work of Lister, 
Koch, Haffkine, and Roux. There is a new life, 
“Pierre Curié” (Macmillan), doubly valuable be- 
cause written by Mme. Curié with her own brief 
autobiography. 
The least you can say of any of these entries is that 
he certainly did something definite to the course of 
history, something whose effects are still felt in 
twentieth-century life. If there are fewer scientists 
and engineers on the list than there should be, it is 
because biographies also were asked for, and biog- 
raphy has been sparse in these fields. Not to choke 
the list with men of letters, I have included only 
those whose writings have had a definite and readily 
recognizable effect on the course of events, as those of 
France — including the Bergeret novels — had on the 
Dreyfus affair, and French affairs in general, 
or as those of Tolstoy in his later period influenced 
the world in and out of Russia. If Wagner does not 
appear it is because I reluctantly conclude that a man 
can change the whole course of musical history 
without affecting the actual conduct of life for most 
of his fellow-men. 
It would be possible for a study-class to arrange a 
program for such a course with this title with one 
book, Georg Brandes’s “Creative Spirits of the 
Nineteenth Century ” (Crowell), vivid essays with 
his accustomed blend of critical estimate and per-
-P-A-G-E-272
  262 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
sonal reaction. He discusses Hans Christian Ander- 
son, Paul Heyse, Esaias Tegner, John Stuart Mill, 
Ernest Renan, Gustave Flaubert, Frederick Paludan- 
Mueller, Bjornsterne Bjornson, Henrik Ibsen, Alger- 
non Charles Swinburne, Giuseppe Garibaldi and 
Napoleon Bonaparte. 
A course of study of this kind should fortify itself 
with all the histories of the Nineteenth Century on 
which it can lay hand. Begin with the new edition 
of C. H. Hazen’s “ Europe Since 1815” (Holt), the 
most popular of them all, and written in the most 
rapidly readable style. Professor G. P. Gooch’s “ His- 
tory of Modern Europe, 1878 to 1919” (Holt), is 
really a history of diplomacy, and must be at hand 
properly to take in the lives of the statesmen and 
rulers on this list. Use also Eduard Fueter’s “ World 
History: 1815: 1920” (Harcourt) and J. Salwyn 
Schapiro’s “Modern and Contemporary European 
History” (Houghton). I find the four volumes of 
“Mr. Punch’s History of Modern England ” (Stokes) 
of constant value in looking up contemporary opinion, 
and as they have the original pictures with many of 
the jokes, they are as good for entertainment as 
for information. 
§ 74 
THE TREND OF THE AGE 
A discussion club whose membership includes both 
men and women and whose subject for the year 
is “The Trend of the Age,” wishes to assemble a 
reading-list of books envisaging this subject from 
different points of view.
-P-A-G-E-273
  TIME PAST AND PRESENT 263 
Tuts age began a long way back—say, for the 
purposes of argument, no earlier than the Neanderthal 
man. It would be no more than fair to include upon 
this list certain works about the ages of which we 
are supposed to be the heir. For example, two recent 
and important. productions of the Yale University 
Press, “The Evolution of Man,” lectures at Yale in 
1921-22, and E. Washburn Hopkins’s “ Origin and 
Evolution of Religion,” “The Trend of the Race,” 
by Samuel J. Holmes (Harcourt), which treats of 
the forces modifying inherited qualities of modern 
civilized peoples and the selective agencies that deter- 
mine what types shall prevail over others, “ The Racial 
History of Man,” by Roland B. Dixon (Scribner), and 
“Social Change: with Respect to Culture and Origi- 
nal Nature,” by William Fielding Ogburn (Huebsch), 
together with Gault’s “Social Psychology” (Holt), 
recently published. 
Then the histories of the last century, elsewhere 
named — Hazen’s, Schapiro’s, Fueter’s, Gooch’s, which 
is strong on diplomacy, Scheville’s “ Political History 
of Modern Europe” (Harcourt) —and “The Trend 
of History,” by W. K. Wallace (Macmillan), which 
considers some of our present conditions and tenden- 
cies in the light of the more recent past. For an 
analysis of European problems in general, “Cross 
Currents in Europe Today,” by Charles A. Beard 
(Marshall Jones), a searching examination by a deep- 
thinking observer, and Herbert Adams Gibbons’s 
“Europe Since 1918” (Century), which admirably 
supplements the daily newspapers and keeps the 
reader informed on “ what has gone before.” Winston
-P-A-G-E-274
  264 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
Churchill’s “The World Crisis” (Scribner), one of 
the most brilliantly written of the list, and “The 
New World,” in which Isaiah Bowman, editor of the 
Geographical Review and director of the American 
Geographical Society, sets down some of the more 
pressing problems in political geography (World), 
are of more than passing value; Dr. Bowman’s book 
is one to which the editor, political writer or teacher 
abreast of his work, will have constant occasion to 
refer. By all means Clarence Case’s “ Non-Violent 
Coercion” (Century), a continuous record of the at- 
tempts, whether or not they were successful, that have 
been made by men in the course of history to resolve 
the problems of advancing civilization and repel ag- 
gression without resorting to war. It goes through the 
time of the Ghandi movement, which it describes. 
Add to this “ Public Opinion in War and Peace,” by 
A. Lawrence Lowell (Harvard University Press). 
Romain Rolland’s illuminating life of “ Mahatma 
Ghandi” has just appeared (Century). 
I may not more than indicate the extent of League 
of Nations literature, say that it is too large for me 
even to make a selective list, and add that the most 
important book that has been written for it, to my 
mind and apparently to that of the world at large, is 
“Woodrow Wilson’s Case for the League of Nations,” 
compiled with his approval by Hamilton Foley 
(Princeton University Press). Every word in the 
book is Mr. Wilson’s own word, and whether one is 
or is not his political adherent, the words in it make 
a book not to be neglected by anyone with an interest 
in contemporary life, thought and history. This has 
 
-P-A-G-E-275
TIME PAST AND PRESENT 265 
the value of a historical document. “The New Old- 
World,” by Thomas Dickinson (Dutton), is a review 
of the situation to-day, appearing at almost the same 
time as his “The United States and the League.” 
(Dutton). 
“The Decadence of Europe,” by the former Italian 
premier, Nitti (Holt), is a cry in the night, an appeal 
to save the old world. “England After War,” by 
C. F. G. Masterman (Harcourt), is equally disquieting 
—and informing. The French seem to be too busy 
to do much writing: they have, however, “As We 
See It,” by René Viviani (Harper), a downright, 
straight-forward book. “Recent Aims and Political 
Development of Japan,” by Rikitaro Fujisawa (Yale 
University Press), one of the addresses at the 
Williamstown Institute of Politics, and Bertrand 
Russell’s “ The Problem of China” (Century) for the 
Far East; for Italy and the Fascist principles and 
program in general, “The Fascist Movement in Ital- 
ian Life,” by Pietro Gorgolini (Little, Brown), which 
treats Fascismo as an instrument of destiny. Count 
Teleki’s “ The Evolution of Hungary and its Place 
in European History” (Macmillan) has besides a 
clear statement of its case one of the most thorough- 
going of bibliographies. Add “‘ New Masters of the 
Baltic,” by Arthur Ruhl (Dutton), Edward M. 
Earle’s timely study of “ Turkey, the Great Powers, 
and the Bagdad Railway” (Macmillan), and Clair 
Price’s interpretation of the Nationalist movement in 
“Rebirth of Turkey” (Seltzer). For the situation 
in Germany, so far as it can get into a book, an 
informing book in English is “The German Revolu-
-P-A-G-E-276
266 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
tion and After: its Disasters and its Hopes,” by Hein- 
rich Strobel of Vorwaerts (Seltzer). 
After reading many books, in three languages and 
in translations, about the Russian situation, I am 
become cautious of recommending one; it seems to 
me that Edward Alsworth Ross’s “ The Russian Soviet 
Republic” (Century) is the most informing for the 
American reader in general. It follows his “ Russia 
in Upheaval” and “ The Russian Bolshevik Revolu- 
tion,” and is certainly impartial and well documented 
—and certainly exciting. There can be no doubt of 
the veracity and vivid power of Iuri Libédinsky’s 
novel “ A Week ” (Huebsch), which gets more of the 
Revolution into a slender book about seven days in a 
village than many a blue-book has held. Nor is M. G. 
Hindus’s “ The Russian Peasant and the Revolution ” 
(Holt) yet out of date. Two books just published 
are of high interest to the student of Russian affairs: 
“The Foreign Policies of Soviet Russia” by A. L. 
P. Dennis (Dutton), and “ The Co-operative Move- 
ment in Russia,” by Elsie Terry Blanc (Macmillan). 
“ New Viewpoints in American History,” by Arthur 
M. Schlesinger (Macmillan), gives those that have 
come up since 1893. “The Economic Development 
of the United States,” by Isaac Lippincott (Appleton), 
is of importance to this study. Along this line of 
development consider “ The Mercantile Marine,” by 
E. Keble Chatterton (Little, Brown), a stirring his- 
tory of merchant shipping from the earliest sailing 
ships to the latest monster liners, with plenty of those 
pictures of ships old and new, that so charm the im- 
agination. Read with this “ America and the Atlan-
-P-A-G-E-277
TIME PAST AND PRESENT 267 
tic” (Dutton), by Vice-Admiral G. A. Ballard, R. N., 
its influence on our history. “The Burden of 
Unemployment,” by Philip Klem (Russell Sage 
Foundation), and the authoritative work on the 
Plumb Plan, “Industrial Democracy,” by Glenn 
Plumb and W. G. Roylance (Huebsch), represent 
problems in economics. 
To close on a high note of courage, “ The Coming 
Renaissance ” is a symposium by English specialists, 
under the direction of Sir James Marchant (Dutton), 
who believes that we are taking breath for a new and 
nobler civilization.

ECONOMICS FOR THE GENERAL READER 
“I would like a reading list on economics, covering 
the subject in various aspects, in works not too 
difficult of comprehension for a business man who 
though not uneducated, did not complete a college 
course.” 
THERE seems to be a general agreement that the 
best book to begin with is Henry Clay’s “ Economics . 
for the General Reader ” (Macmillan) ; it satisfies all 
requirements for the inquiring general reader, and 
affords an impetus for further study. Among the 
more elaborate treatises Alfred Marshall’s “ Principles 
of Economics ” (Macmillan), now in its seventh edi- 
tion, still holds first place, though F. W. Taussig’s 
“Principles of Economics” (Macmillan), now in its 
third edition, revised, and H. R. Seager’s “ Principles 
of Economics ” (Holt) would perhaps challenge that.  
-P-A-G-E-278
268 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
“The Trend of Economics ” is soon (at this writing) 
to be published by Knopf, and should be added to 
the group of books on economic theory; it reveals the 
hopes for economics cherished by younger American 
theorists. 
Next comes “An Introduction to Economic His- 
tory,” by N. S. B. Gras (Harper), and H. G. 
Moulton’s “ The Financial Organization of Society ” 
(University of Chicago Press), both recent publica- 
tions. For the relation of labor to economics in this 
country, “A History of Trade Unionism in the United 
States ” by Selig Perlman (Macmillan). For the rela- 
tion of agriculture to the subject, G. F. Warren’s 
“Farm Management ” (Macmillan). There is a new 
(fourth) edition of the famous college text, “Chap- 
ters on the Theory and History of Banking,” by C. F. 
Dunbar (Putnam), which has material on the Federal 
Reserve System by Prof. H. Parker Willis of 
Columbia, former Secretary of the Federal Reserve 
Board, bringing the record to date. With this, the 
newly published “Money,” by W. T. Foster and 
Waddill Catchings (Houghton, Mifflin), and F. Lav- 
ington’s “ The Trade Cycle” (P. S. King, 1922). H. 
R. Seager’s “ Practical Problems in Economics ” (Holt, 
1923) brings the discussion of current economic 
problems to the present time. The “History of 
Trade Unionism ” by the Webbs (Longmans, Green), 
is a large and expensive volume indispensable to the 
student and not beyond the interest of the general 
reader.

STUDYING SOCIAL WORK 
“I would like suggestions for books that might be 
recommended to a group of girls in regard to the 
study of social work.” 
“Wuart 1s Soca, CaszE Work?” by M. E. Rich- 
mond (Russell Sage Foundation), is a small book 
which gives an authoritative and sympathetic inter- 
pretation of the field of social case work. It is not 
technical, but was written for persons somewhat in- 
formed in regard to social work. The same author’s 
“The Good Neighbor” (Lippincott) is a small book 
written for the general public, now somewhat out 
of date because it was written sixteen years or more 
ago, but for all that an admirable introduction to a 
study of social problems and the kind of work at- 
tempted by organized social agencies. 
“ Social Work,” by Edward T. Devine (Macmillan) 
is his most recent book, and covers the whole field. 
Mr. Devine’s “The Normal Life”? (McMurtrie) is a 
shorter book which also attempts to cover the whole 
field with the matter differently arranged. Amos G. 
Warner’s “ American Charities” (Crowell) in its 
second revision, is an authoritative description of 
social problems of charitable agencies; it has much 
statistical material and is the standard work of 
its type. 
Whatever books are read by this group, one should 
be read and reread; this is the noble record of Jane 
Addams’s life and work, “Twenty Years at Hull 
 
-P-A-G-E-280
  270 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
House ” (Macmillan). Besides being one of the most 
important of American autobiographies, it is of high 
value to the student of these subjects. 
§77 
INTERNATIONAL FINANCE 
“What books will inform a reader on present condi- 
tions in international finance, especially in regard 
to loans?” 
ExtsHa FrrepMan’s “ International Finance and its 
Reorganization” (Dutton) has been often recom- 
mended to me by students of financial and economic 
post-war reconstruction. Another valuable book pub- 
lished last year is R. G. Hawtrey’s “ Monetary Recon- 
struction” (Longmans), a collection of essays deal- 
ing with practical problems of currency reform. The 
same author’s “ Currency and Credit,” recently issued 
in a new edition (Longmans), has a new chapter on 
“Tnternational Indebtedness.” 
A reading list for such a purpose should include 
standard authorities on economics and banking, such 
as Seager’s “ Principles of Economics” (Holt), and 
with some books on deflation, such as E. H. Kem- 
merer’s “ High Prices and Deflation ” or “ Effects of 
the War on Money, Credit and Banking in France and 
the United States,” published by the Division of 
Economics and History of the Carnegie Endowment 
for International Peace.

MUSIC BOOKS FOR THE LISTENER 
“What books on music would interest and stimulate 
@ concert-and-opera-goer who has had no special 
education along musical lines?” 
I wave elsewhere indicated some of the books 
intended as beginners’ guides to musical appreciation: 
here are a dozen that will afford an intelligent lis- 
tener much information with which to enrich his 
listening, and serve either as a general musical library 
for the home or as the nucleus of a larger collection 
for the professional. 
Ernest Newman’s “A Musical Motley” (Dodd, 
Mead), piquant essays by a musical critic with the 
power of taking the ordinary reader into what he 
may have thought a charmed circle accessible only to 
musicians. Henry T. Finck’s “ Success in Music and 
How it is Won” (Scribner), another book by a 
famous critic, brings to the general reader, by 
methods adapted to his needs, the result of sound 
judgment and scholarship. I have already spoken of 
Paul Landormy’s “History of Music” (Scribner), 
which is more of a reading-history; for a text-book 
such as many find directly useful for looking up com- 
posers and compositions, W. D. Baltzell’s “ History of 
Music” (Presser) is reliable and widely-used. Use 
with this Romain Rolland’s “ Musicians of To-day” 
273  
-P-A-G-E-284
  274 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
(Holt), which might be reinforced by his “Some 
Musicians of Former Days” (Holt). The literary 
quality of these is high, and all Rolland’s judgments 
are given with a direct simplicity that is appealing. 
Two books by the editor of The Etude, J. F. Cooke, 
will be constantly useful to the concert or opera lis- 
tener, “Great Singers on the Art of Singing” (Pres- 
ser), and “Great Pianists on Piano Playing” 
(Presser). To these should be added “ Violin 
Mastery ” (Stokes), in which Frederick H. Martens 
gathers from interviews with famous violinists the 
salient features of their study methods, and a com- 
panion volume, Mr. Martens’s “String Mastery” 
(Stokes), devoted to chamber music and its great 
living exponents. Books like these have, of course, 
peculiar charm for one engaged in the same line of 
business, but their value to the listener is in its own 
way as great; the one on “ String Mastery,” for in- 
stance, will inform him so well on the powers and 
possibilities of instruments of which he knows nothing 
from experience that a chamber music concert will 
be quite a new affair to him. James Gibbons Hune- 
ker’s “ Chopin: the Man and his Music” (Scribner) 
is a book to adorn any library: to the musician’s 
library it is indispensable. Niecks’s “ Program 
Music” (Novello) will be found directly valuable. 
For a handbook of plots with motifs and such-like 
information, I find Gustav Kobbé’s “ The Complete 
Opera Book” (Putnam) the most useful, but there 
are several other good ones. If the listener is 
especially interested in the history and development 
of the orchestra, W. F. Henderson’s “ The Orchestra 
 
-P-A-G-E-285
  
THE ARTS AND GRACES 275 
and Orchestral Music” (Scribner) is good; it has 
many illustrations including those of musical instru- 
ments: another popular work for the attendant at 
symphony concerts is “The Orchestra and how to 
Listen to It,” by M. Montague-Nathan (Dutton), 
which describes the principles of sound production, the 
instruments and orchestra system. And as a climax 
and conclusion the mighty “Grove’s Dictionary of 
Music and Musicians,” of which the new edition, re- 
vised and enlarged, runs to six volumes, including 
American music and serving as an encyclopedia of 
the art (Macmillan). 
§ 79 
COLOR BOOKS 
“ J am interested in the new literature of color, and in 
the study of color in all its aspects, and would like 
a list of representative works on various phases of 
the subject.” 
Brcin with “Principles of Advertising Arrange- 
ment,” by Frank Alvah Parsons (Prang Co.), because 
the principles of color and form here explained will 
make intelligible any other modern treatment of 
color, and give the reader a basis for judgment. 
“Color and its Applications,” by Marion Luckiesh 
(Van Nostrand), and “ Color in Everyday Life,” by 
Louis Weinberg (Moffat, Yard), because they give an 
excellent general idea of the thousand ways in which 
color is studied and applied today, and fairly push 
the reader into doing research for himself. ‘“ The 
New Interior,” by Hazel Adler (Century), which is
-P-A-G-E-286
  276 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
a survey of American applied art, with emphasis 
upon personality in interior decoration. Whether one 
agrees or not with Mrs. Adler’s color-schemes, the 
book is intensely stimulating. ‘“ Form and Colour,” 
by Lisle March Phillips (Scribner), is useful philoso- 
phy to wrap around the color ideas obtained from the 
other books. 
With these as an introduction, the best book on 
color and sight for a student of scientific mind is John 
Herbert Parsons’s “Color Vision” (Putnam), which 
explains several color theories and gives a good bibli- 
ography. The chapter on “Sensation” in Robert S. 
Woodworth’s “ Psychology: a Study of Mental Life” 
(Holt) has what many believe to be the best ex- 
planation yet of Christine Ladd-Franklin’s theory of 
rod-and-cone vision, and several color theories are ex- 
plained also in John B. Watson’s “ Psychology from 
the Standpoint of a Behaviorist ” (Lippincott). 
“The Art of Colour,” by Michel Jacobs (Double- 
day, Page), is the most comprehensive work of its 
kind in recent years; it contains a valuable table of 
chemical composition of colors with their places in 
the spectrum and a brief history of each item; and in 
every department of the subject has something of 
high interest and value. “Modern Color,” by Carl 
C. Cutler and Stephen C. Pepper, is a recent publica- 
tion of the Harvard University Press, explaining a 
method of painting practiced successfully by the 
authors and many of their friends. “The Colorist,” 
by J. Arthur H. Hatt (Van Nostrand), offers inter- 
esting color-masks, with explanations of the additive 
and subtractive methods of obtaining color-harmonies.  
-P-A-G-E-287
  
THE ARTS AND GRACES 277 
One chapter of the fascinating book “The New 
Science of Colour,” by Beatrice Irwin (Rider, Lon- 
don), is devoted to a plea for the establishment of a 
-color theatre with a color college attached, where all 
color ideas could be studied and tried out; this book 
is highly stimulating. ‘“ Architecture and Democ- 
racy,” by Claude Bragdon (Knopf), which sum- 
marizes his ideas for organizing the color possibilities 
of this country, mentions the color systems for music 
of A. Wallace Rimington and Louis W. Wilson, and 
“Continental Stagecraft,” by Macgowan and Jones 
(Harcourt, Brace), explains many new developments 
in mobile color on the stage. 
“The Future of Painting,” by Willard Huntington 
Wright (Huebsch), gives a theory of the “ new art of 
color” that is causing sharp discussion; Arpad Gers- 
ter replies to it in two articles in the Freeman, 
February 21 and 28, 1923. “ Principles of Interior 
Decoration,” by Bernard Jakway (Macmillan), is 
packed with color facts for home use, besides being 
a practical work in all departments of its subject, for 
teacher or home-decorator; another work of value in 
this connection is the well-known “ Interior Decora- 
tion: its Principles and Practice,” by Frank Alvah 
Parsons (Doubleday, Page), especially the chapter on 
“Color and its Relation to the Decorative Idea.” 
Mr. Parsons collaborated with Harry Tipper, H. L. 
Hollingworth and George Burton Hotchkiss in “ Ad- 
vertising: its Principles and Practice” (Ronald 
Press) and the result is a volume that should be in 
every advertising man’s library. There is a chapter 
on color in Part IV, “ Advertising Display.”

books by which it may be extended. 
§ 80 
HOW TO BEHAVE 
“What is the best book on etiquette?” 
Nor often can one answer a “ best book ” question so 
briefly and so accurately as by telling this inquirer to 
get Emily Price Post’s “ Etiquette” (Funk and Wag- 
nalls). She takes the subject with the seriousness that 
it deserves, but with not too much at any one spot; it 
is light-handed and light-hearted, and not in the 
least light-headed. The feature that distinguishes it, 
in my mind, is her emphasis upon essentials and her 
ability to distinguish between these and incidentals, 
however important these may be. As a result, one 
may not only learn from its pages how formal exis- 
tence is conducted in the establishments of the 
mighty, but how entertainments given with a limited 
equipment may be “correct.” I think Thackeray 
would have liked this book, and that will mean some- 
thing to one who has read “A Little Dinner at 
Timmins’s ” or “ The Book of Snobs.” 
This is not to say that this is the only reliable 
guide to manners: Emily Holt’s “ Encyclopedia of 
Etiquette ” (Doubleday, Page) is a favorite work, and 
in spite of its title a small and inexpensive book; 
Ellin Craven Learned’s “Everybody’s Complete
-P-A-G-E-289
  
THE ARTS AND GRACES 279 
Etiquette” (Stokes) is another widely read; its 
chapter on “Good Manners for Boys and Girls” is 
also available in a separate small book. For young 
people still at school or lately come from it, “ Every- 
day Manners,” compiled by Lucy L. W. Wilson and 
the staff of the South Philadelphia High School (Mac- 
millan), provides for all situations to which they are 
likely to be exposed. For the very young, there are 
the nursery guides, the “Goop” books of Gelett 
Burgess (Stokes), a long list of them, all good, upon 
whose demure admonitions many a good set of man- 
ners has been based. There is a rhymed compendium 
for a British schoolboy called “ Littleman’s Book of 
Courtesy ” (Dutton) which has been favorably re- 
ceived in this country; it is sensible and catches in 
the memory. 
It is not fair to speak of etiquette books and leave 
out the perfect parody of them, Donald Ogden 
Stewart’s “ Perfect Behavior” (Doran). One who 
has just been through a large wedding and is still 
licking his wounds will find from its pages that it is 
still possible to laugh. Indeed, I have known it to 
stave off nervous prostration in two wedding parties 
by being used freely during the last wild weeks before 
the functions. 
There are a few books that go to the basal principles 
of good manners, but none that present them so 
nobly as the chapter on Chinese civilization and the 
value to it of ceremony and music, in Havelock Ellis’s 
tremendous work, “ The Dance of Life” (Houghton, 
Mifflin). It elevates the whole matter to the high 
plane of spiritual development and leaves the reader 
 
-P-A-G-E-290
    280 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
with ideas so lucid that they can be at once put to 
service in everyday living. Books like Helen Star- 
rett’s “The Charm of Fine Manners” (Lippincott) 
and Margaret Bailey’s “The Value of Good Man- 
ners” (Doubleday, Page), showing how courtesy 
makes life move more easily in its various manifesta- 
tions, may reveal to some young people with a gener- 
ous spirit of revolt against what they may think are 
but unmeaning conventions, that etiquette makes the 
traffic laws of everyday conduct. And if there should 
be need of a book to show what not having any train- 
ing at all in manners in early life may do to the future 
of even a charming and happily-married woman, 
there is “ The Log Cabin Lady” (Little, Brown), an 
anonymous autobiography. 
§ 81 
COSTUME BOOKS 
“A library whose books on costume are in French 
wishes to add the best general histories of costume 
in the English language, and to be advised on im- 
portant works on costume available in English.” 
Ir is typical of the two nations that the best general 
histories of costume are all in French, and the best 
English books about costume are all about British 
costume. There is, for a general history, the peerless 
Racinet, whose six volumes of “Le Costume His- 
torique” came from the house of Didot in Paris in 
1888, with countless plates in color and in tint. It 
is out of print—that one must expect with such
-P-A-G-E-291
  
THE ARTS AND GRACES 281 
books, many of which are issued only in limited 
editions — but may be picked up secondhand if from 
ninety to a hundred and fifty dollars is previously 
laid down. Nothing quite takes the place of Racinet, 
and as in matters of costume the pictures are the 
main concern, the fact that the text is in French is 
not so important; it has, however, the drawback that 
the figures are too small to indicate all the details, 
and it is not very easy to find what one wants. 
There is a student’s edition of Racinet at a lower 
price. 
The best book on costume in English is Planché’s 
“ Encyclopedia of Costume,” two volumes, imperial 
octavo, with many colored and other plates, published 
about 1876, and running from fifty to sixty dollars 
in price. Of the other standard works Pauquet’s 
“Tllustrations of English and Foreign Costume from 
the 15th Century to the Present Day” was pub- 
lished by Sotheran of London in 1875, Calthrop’s four 
celebrated volumes of “ British Costume,” by Black, 
in 1906. Talbot Hughes’s “ Dress Design” (Pitman) 
is of recent date, a trustworthy textbook of workshop 
practice as well as a handbook of historic costume, 
with 600 figures, very clear collotype reproductions, 
and the great merit of 67 pages of patterns. G. W. 
Rhead’s “Chats on Costumes” (Stokes) is a well- 
illustrated work for the amateur, with attention to 
dress accessories. C. H. Ashdown’s “ British Costume 
During Nineteen Centuries ” was published by T. C. 
Jack, London, 1910. 
Two large and carefully illustrated works on 
American costume are issued by Jacobs, Philadelphia,  
-P-A-G-E-292
  282 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
and are in print; they are by Elizabeth McClellan, 
“Historic Dress in America: 1507 to 1800” and 
“ Historic Dress in America: 1800 to 1870.” These 
have colored plates and many reproductions from 
authentic portraits and original garments. The 
“Catalogue of American Historical Costumes” by 
Mrs. Rose Gouverneur Hoes (Washington, 1915) con- 
tains half-tones of those costumes of the wives of the 
Presidents that form one of the. most attractive 
exhibits in the U. S. National Museum —it is an 
impressive tribute to the importance of dress that 
scarce anyone notices that all those figures have the 
same face. Alice Morse Earle’s “Two Centuries of 
Costume in America” (Macmillan, 1905) and Robida’s 
“ Yester-year: Ten Centuries of Toilette” (Scribner, 
1891), George Clinch’s “English Costume from Pre- 
historic Times to the End of the 18th Century” 
(McClurg, 1912) —these are out of print but not 
yet out of reach. “Costumes of All Nations” 
(Grevel, London, 1913) contains 123 double plates, 
all colored, seldom matched as to clearness of detail: 
it is a reprint of the German original and there is 
the least possible amount of text. “ Dame Fashion: 
Paris-London, 1786-1912,” by Julius Mendes Price, 
was published by Low Marston and Co., London, in 
1913. The translation from the German of Max von 
Boehn made by M. Edwardes, “ Modes and Manners 
of the Nineteenth Century” (Dutton), with many 
beautiful plates of dress, 1790-1878, is still in print, 
in three volumes. 
For practical present-day purposes rather than for 
the enrichment of a reference library come Wilfrid
-P-A-G-E-293
  THE ARTS AND GRACES 283 
Webb’s “ The Heritage of Dress,” republished by the 
Times Book Club, London, in 1912, and the provoca- 
tive volume on “ The Psychology of Dress,” by Frank 
Alvah Parsons (Doubleday, Page), which has for 
subtitle “Life Expressed in Clothes.” When Mr. 
Parsons began to talk on this subject he was a voice 
crying in the wilderness, and some of the things he 
cried out used to make hitherto contented middle- 
aged ladies go home and weep over their wardrobes. 
Constance D’Arcy Mackaye gives good advice for 
beginners in stage production in her popular “ Scenery 
and Costumes for Amateurs” (Holt), and the 
Woman’s Press publishes a volume of “National 
Costumes of the Slavic Peoples ” designed for the use 
of those giving plays or pageants that present their 
life and customs. Its pictures are in black and white, 
but an ingenious color chart makes it possible to 
give accurate directions for carrying them out in the 
original colors. 
The collector of costume books will see how far 
from exhaustive is this list, and the amateur who is 
led by it to enter upon this charming by-path of col- 
lecting will soon learn to read catalogues and frequent 
book-sales, with titles like these in mind.

A COLLECTOR’S EQUIPMENT 
“I am building a collection of early American glass, 
brass and pewter, furniture and the like, and would 
like books of value to one making a business of 
this.”
-P-A-G-E-294
  284 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
Wa ter Dver’s “ The Lure of the Antique” (Cen- 
tury) and Gardner Teall’s ‘“‘ The Pleasures of Collect- 
ing” (Century) are sympathetic guides to intelligent 
buying for a beginner. “Collecting Antiques,’ by 
Felix Gade (Putnam), is a larger work finely illus- 
trated, for the connoisseur. Alice Van Leer Carrick’s 
practical and personal experiences in “ Collector’s 
Luck ” and “ The Next-to-Nothing House ” (Atlantic) 
are bound to start anyone on such expeditions; they 
have the exciting quality of a collector’s tales of how 
he “ picked up ” this or that. 
For glass, begin with “The Glass Collector,” by 
Maclver Percival (Dodd), and add “ American Glass- 
ware Old and New,” by Edwin A. Barber (Patterson 
and White Co., 1900), “ American Bottles, Old and 
New,” by William S. Walbridge (Owens Bottle Co., 
Toledo), Frederick W. Hunter’s “Stiegel Glass” 
(Houghton), and the recent “Checklist of Early 
American Bottles and Flasks,” published by the au- 
thor, Stephen Van Rensselaer, 873 Madison Avenue, 
New York. As in all suggestions on books for arts 
and crafts, I do not pretend to keep to those that are 
in print or easy to get; some of the best books on all 
these subjects are now accessible to the public only in 
collections. 
The “Chats” series (Stokes) is made up of a 
number of volumes useful and informing for the col- 
lector: for this collector’s purpose the most in de- 
mand will be “ Chats on Old Copper and Brass,” by 
F. W. Burgess, which includes even musical instru- 
ments; the same author’s “Chats on Household 
Curios”; Arthur Hayden’s “Chats on Old Sheffield
-P-A-G-E-295
  THE ARTS AND GRACES 285 
Plate” and “ Old Silver,” and J. L. T. Masse’s “ Old 
Pewter.” All the “Chats” have good bibliographies. 
Mr. Burgess’s “ Silver, Pewter and Sheffield Plate ” is 
published by Dutton: N. Hudson Moore’s “Old 
Pewter, Brass, Copper and Sheffield Plate” by Stokes. 
Mr. Moore’s “ Old Clock Book” (Stokes) includes a 
list of several thousand clockmakers. Other valuable 
books are Edward J. Gale’s “ Pewter and the Amateur 
Collector” (Scribner), Masse’s ‘“‘ Pewter Collector ” 
and Lewer’s “China Collector” (Dodd), Burgess’s 
books on “ Old Metal Work ” and “ Old Pottery and 
Porcelain,” and an especially fascinating one on 
“ Antique Jewellery and Trinkets” (Putnam). 
“A General History of Porcelain,” by William Bur- 
ton (Funk and Wagnalls), is a recent and important 
publication in two octavo volumes, with a vast number 
of illustrations of which many are in color. It is a 
survey of the development of porcelain from the 
earliest Chinese production to the present day, and 
in every country of the world in which it has been 
produced. 
“Early English Furniture and Woodwork,” by 
Herbert Cescinsky and Ernest Gribble (Funk), is 
in two large volumes beautifully illustrated; like the 
porcelain book, it is a luxurious and authoritative 
work for libraries or the connoisseur. So is “ Colonial 
Furniture in America,” by Luke V. Lockwood (Scrib- 
ner), also in two volumes, with nearly nine hundred 
illustrations. “Early American Craftsmen,” by Wal- 
ter Dyer (Century), is a study for the general reader 
of the life and work of our first artists in furniture, 
glass, clock-making, silver, pewter and the like,

THE LACE LOVER’S BOOKS 
“What books would be of interest to the collector 
of lace?” 
“ A Lace GuipE ror Makers AND CoLLectors,” by 
Gertrude Whiting (Dutton), is accurate, comprehen- 
sive and authoritative; it has a bibliography that 
sweeps the field and a five-language nomenclature that 
shows what an international institution lace is. 
Charlotte Kellogg’s “ Bobbins of Belgium” (Funk) 
is a warm-hearted and picturesque account of Belgian 
lace, lace-workers, lace schools and lace villages. 
“Old World Lace,” by Clara M. Blum (Dutton), is 
another guide with many illustrations. N. Hudson 
Moore’s “ Lace Book” (Stokes) is a history of lace- 
making whose illustrations include portraits of men 
and women wearing famous laces. Mrs. R. E. Head’s 
“The Lace and Embroidery Collector” (Dodd) is 
another illustrated guide of value.

COLLECTING BOOKS 
“Will you suggest books that would give me informa- 
tion on collecting rare and fine books or first edi- 
tions? Could you also tell me what elements enter 
into the determination of the value of rare books?” 
A coop book for one intending to make a business 
of it, either commercially or in gathering a noteworthy

THE ARTS AND GRACES 287 
private collection, is De Ricco’s “ Book Collector’s 
Manual,” published by Rosenbach, whose name is a 
guarantee of the authoritative character of the book. 
The standard reference work is Brunet’s “ Manuel de 
libraire et de l’amateur des livres.” This is invalu- 
able; booksellers everywhere, listing desirable old 
books, give their numbers in “ Brunet.” A photo- 
graphic reprint has recently been published, but the 
best edition is the fifth (Paris, 1860-1865), with its 
various supplements. Almost all bibliographical 
reference books are out of print and scarce; but as 
the book collector reads a great number of antiquari- 
ans’ catalogues as well as browses’ in old stalls, he 
knows that almost any book is somehow obtainable. 
When it is very, very difficult to find; when it never 
turns up in a catalogue but is scouted for personally, 
it is known among bibliographers as “rare.” 
“Scarce” means hard to find, and “ unique” is used 
in its literal sense; “ uncut”? means merely that no 
binder has sheared the margins. The necessity for 
such linguistic curbs on enthusiasm is shown in many 
books in which a book-lover tells how he began to 
collect and some of the adventures he had. “ Ven- 
tures in Book-Collecting,” by the late William Harris 
Arnold (Scribner), is one of the most recent of these. 
Arnold’s process involved the expenditure of a great 
deal of money, for he went into it on the grand scale, 
but the collector with less to spend will like to read it. 
The English tradition of discursive essays on books 
and book-collecting is an old one. From the lavishly 
illustrated volumes of Thomas Frognall Dibden, the 
arch bibliophile of the early nineteenth century,
-P-A-G-E-298
288 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
through Andrew Lang’s immortal “ Books and Book- 
men” (London, 1887), which contains many of his 
poems on books, to Alfred W. Pollard’s “ Books in 
the Home,” published by Arthur Humphreys, London, 
1907, the effort has been to put the reader in the 
right frame of mind to get comfort, joy and enrich- 
ment from the collecting of books. Pollard’s book 
has not a trace of that faint snobbishness not unknown 
among bookmen, and the underlying principles of that 
sweet avocation slide gently into the soul while com- 
mercialism and spiritual pride slip away. I wish 
someone would reprint at least the chapter on “ The 
Child’s Bookshelf,” not because it gives titles, for it 
doesn’t, but for the sound advice. For instance, that 
you should not write the child’s name in a book when 
you give it to him but say instead “If you like this 
book very much, a year hence I will write your name 
in it; if not, do what you like with it.” Or his cau- 
tion that if a child’s own shelf be placed in a living 
room, to make its position “as inconspicuous as pos- 
sible, lest the shelf attract too much attention and a 
habit of mind be cultivated which might lead to the 
acquisition of the Hundred Best Books.” Mr. Pollard 
is Keeper of Printed Books in the British Museum 
and one of the greatest living bibliographers: his 
“Fine Books” is an imposing quarto in the “Con- 
noisseur’s Library” (Putnam), his “Old Picture 
Books,” published by Methuen, is a delight, and he 
has contributed the volume “Early Illustrated 
Books ” to that most informative series edited by 
him, “ Books about Books” (London: Kegan Paul, 
Trench, Trubner & Co., 1893), which also includes

“Early Printed Books” by E. Gordon Duff, “ Books 
in Manuscript ” by Falconer Madan, “ Book Plates” 
by W. J. Hardy, “ Book Bindings” by Herbert P. 
Horne, “ The Great Book Collectors ” by Charles and 
Mary Elton, and Pollard’s “The Decoration of 
Books.” ‘How to Collect Books,” by J. Herbert 
Slater, editor of the British “ Book Prices Current ” 
(Macmillan), has an opening chapter giving the small 
points that bibliophiles—in general the least com- 
municative of creatures concerning their affairs — 
take for granted people are born knowing. The Foré- 
nightly Review printed in 1901 an article of “ Book 
Collecting as an Investment,” afterwards reprinted. 
The collector, whether of early, rare, curious or fine 
printed books, depends greatly on his works of refer- 
ence. He is always verifying an item in Hain or 
Brunet, or in Evans’ “ American Bibliography ” (Chi- 
cago, Privately Printed, 1903, 8 vols.) if it is an 
American imprint, or in Updike if it is remarkable 
as printing. Practically all the books now extant that 
were printed before a.v. 1500 have been described; 
but to find your way among the bibliographies of 
“jncunabula” R. A. Peddie’s “ Fifteenth-Century 
Books” (London, Grafton, 1913) is needed. Careful 
check-lists seem to have been issued on all the early 
editions of famous authors, so that it is easy to tell 
whether or not you have stumbled on the first issue 
of the first edition, with the misprints where they 
should be. 
Very few persons will ever buy fine printing as 
such, although many will be attracted by the reputa- 
tions of certain printers. “Elzevier,” “ Franklin”  
-P-A-G-E-300
  290 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
and “Strawberry Hill” (Horace Walpole’s press) 
are imprints of interest to many; but their printing is 
decidedly second-rate. The reason for this is that 
printing is the hardest thing in the world to appreciate 
simply through being told. Only a real technical 
understanding enables the collector to gloat over one 
page and shudder at another, when neither page has 
what Alice required —“ pictures or conversation.” 
There will, however, be more interest in typography, 
old and new, since D. B. Updike’s incomparable 
“Printing Types” (Harvard) has gone through two 
editions. Mr. Updike’s Merrymount Press has been 
producing books as a commercial enterprise since 
1893 and each one is a brilliant solution of the prob- 
lems of typography. Bruce Rogers is the most famous 
designer of books now living; his cult is even greater 
in England than here. His imprint is generally on a 
limited edition, which promptly becomes a collector’s 
item. Indeed, Updike and Rogers are the two 
American printers all of whose work is valuable to 
any typographic collector. Stanley Morison in Eng- 
land is bringing out “ Four Centuries of Fine Print- 
ing” (London: Ernest Benn. Early in 1924) which 
will present hundreds of useful facsimiles. Once the 
collector learns what good printing is, he will probably 
acquire all the books of some one particular press, 
not yet very famous and then wait for time to vindi- 
cate his choice. 
The best way to start the collecting game is to 
place a little list of “ desiderata,” on any subject at 
all, in (say) the Publisher’s Weekly. For the rest of 
your life you will probably receive catalogues from

antiquarians on all the subjects there are. The same 
result may be obtained, I believe, by applying for 
membership in the British, or American, Bibliographi- 
cal Society, or the new Oxford Bibliographical 
Society.

A BRIDE’S BOOKSHELF 
“A bride asks for books on housekeeping in all its 
branches, for immediate practical use, especially 
cookbooks that are economical and practical.” 
“Cooxtnc For Two” by Janet McKenzie Hill 
(Little, Brown) has come to the rescue of many a 
bride in its day; it is a good beginner’s book, and so 
is “ The Plain Sailing Cook Book,” by Susanna Brown 
(Scribner) which is really what the title says it is, 
and like the other is on a two-person scale of measure- 
ment. “Better Meals for Less Money,” by Mary 
Green, (Holt) keeps down the cost without sacrificing 
food values; there are 700 tried recipes, and some 
I’ve tried and they are all right. 
When I began to use Mrs. Lincoln’s “ Boston Cook 
Book” (Little, Brown) it certainly had to be lucid 
or I wouldn’t have understood it and economical or 
I couldn’t have used it. I bought it because we were 
going to keep house in New Hampshire that summer, 
and the manuscript book I had just brought home 
from Europe, garnished with recipes dictated by 
brand-new European relatives, would have been as 
much out of place as huckleberry pie at Café Bauer. 
Mrs. Lincoln has been propped up alongside the egg- 
beater so many times that her pages would be nutri-

tious if boiled. I couldn’t be expected to recommend 
any other cookbook with quite the same gusto, but 
I will admit that for a real encyclopedia Fannie Mer- 
ritt Farmer’s “ Boston Cooking-School Book ” (Little, 
Brown) is certainly a wonder, and that it would be 
hard to find fault with Isabel Ely Lord’s “ Every- 
body’s Cookbook ” (Holt) which is based on records 
for the past thirty years in Pratt Institute, where Miss 
Lord was Director of the School of Household Science 
and Arts. For cookbooks off the regular line, “ Col- 
ette’s Best Recipes ” (Little, Brown) has a place of its 
own; it is real French recipes, not the fluffy inter- 
national ones, but nourishing savory ones like panade 
a Voignon and haricot de mouton — good old family 
fillers. “The Stag Cook Book” (Doran) is made 
of the contributions of a number of famous men, each 
telling how to make his favorite dish. It is a very 
good collection, for most men can cook one dish better 
than most women— given all the utensils in the 
house and someone else to clean up. The most liter- 
ary of cook-books is “ A Handbook of Cookery for a 
Small House,” by Jessie Conrad (Doubleday, Page), 
to which the great Joseph puts a preface. 
“The Up to Date Waitress,” by Janet McKenzie 
Hill (Little, Brown), is a present help to the young 
employer. “House Decoration and Repairs,” by 
William Prebble (Pitman), is a little book for a handy 
man. “The House Owner’s Book ” (Funk and Wag- 
nalls) is for use in building or for maintenance; it is 
useful in carpentering, painting and plumbing matters 
around house or garage. “ Home-Making Simplified,” 
by Bertha Streeter (Harper), and “ Marketing and 
 
-P-A-G-E-303
  THE ARTS AND GRACES 293 
House Work Manual,” by S. A. Dunham (Little, 
Brown), are helps in the wise expenditure of time and 
effort. “Cheating the Junk Pile,” by Edith Peyser 
(Dutton), proves its value at a glance; it tells not 
only how to choose the various labor-saving devices, 
but makes a special feature of showing one how to 
keep them working at maximum efficiency instead of 
taking up room in the cellar. I cannot speak from 
experience in the effectiveness of books on domestic 
budgets, but I am told that “The Simplified Budget 
Method” in printed forms (Dutton) and “ Getting 
Your Money’s Worth,” by Isabel Ely Lord (Harcourt, 
Brace), are easy to put into practice. 
If one is taking up domestic management in a seri- 
ous way, Lippincott’s “Home Manuals” cover it in 
all its branches in a series of books by experts, in- 
tended for use as text-books for schools of domestic 
science, but excellent for reference by the woman at 
home. “The Business of the Household,” “Home 
and Community Hygiene,” “Clothing for Women,” 
“ Housewifery,” ‘“ Laundering,” “ Practical Canning 
and Preserving,” are among them. Henrietta Pea- 
body’s illustrated guides to good taste, “Inside the 
House Beautiful,’ “Outside the House Beautiful” 
and “ What Makes the House Beautiful,’ come from 
the Atlantic Monthly Press. Amelia Leavitt Hill’s 
“ Redeeming Old Homes ” (Holt) is an inspiring guide 
to that delectable occupation, making an old house 
into a new home. 
Mary H. Northend’s “ The Small House: its Pos- 
sibilities” (Dodd) is an excellent work for one with 
a little house to build, remodel, furnish or surround

with flowers. Charles White, author of “ Successful 
Houses and How to Build Them,” has a new one called 
“The Bungalow Book ” (Macmillan), which goes into 
the small but greatly important details of building. 
McBride publishes a series of books about small 
houses of various types, good for buyer or builder. 
For conduct of the garden of a house large or small, 
get “Gardening with Brains,” by Henry T. Finck 
(Harper), the most sensible book for a beginner and 
valuable to anyone with a plot of ground.

CHESS 
“What is the best book for a beginner in chess?” 
Tue best and simplest for the beginner is R. F. 
Greene’s “ Chess,” published by Bell in England and 
in this country, obtainable from the American Chess 
Co., 150 Nassau Street, N. Y., where Herman Helms 
holds sway and offers the largest variety of chess books 
anywhere obtainable. A much more elaborate book, 
also published by Bell, is Staunton’s “Chess Player’s 
Handbook,” which has a magnificent collection of 
games, covers the same ground in greater detail, and 
is instructive both to the beginner and the advanced 
player.

THE EINSTEIN THEORY 
“What are the best books on the Einstein theory, and

Tur theory of relativity is reduced to its lowest 
terms and floated into the consciousness of the ordi- 
nary human being on a tide of gentle humor in “ Easy 
Lessons in Einstein,” by E. E. Slosson (Harcourt, 
Brace). I am assured on good scientific authority 
that this work is thoroughly sound in its statements, 
and being myself in the matter of mathematics not 
even ordinary but subnormal it was a comfort to be 
able to feel— while I was reading this volume — 
buoyed up by the sweet delusion that I knew exactly 
what it meant. 
“ Gravitation versus Relativity,” by Charles Lane 
Poor (Putnam), is a non-technical explanation of the 
principles of gravitational astronomy and a critical 
examination of astronomical evidence of relativity. 
In Ivor Hart’s little volume, “ Makers of Science” 
(Oxford University Press), there is a brief popular ex- 
position of the theory under the title “ Einstein and 
Relativity.” The biographical method is employed in 
Alexander Moszkowski’s unusual work, “ Einstein the 
Searcher ” (Dutton), which is set down in dialogues 
and besides its value to the student of this subject is 
one of interest to the psychologist. 
The great authority being, of course, the discoverer 
himself, the greatest interest and value attaches to his 
own works, “ Relativity,” by Albert Einstein (Holt), 
and the one added after his recent visit to this coun- 
try as the result of his lectures here, “The Meaning 
of Relativity ” (Princeton University Press). 
And now the immensely popular “relativity film ” 
appears in book form with amusing and convincing 
pictures, as “ The Einstein Theory of Relativity,” by 
Garrett P. Serviss (E. M. Fadman).

THE BABY: HIS CARE AND COMFORT 
“What reliable, authoritative books on infant care 
are there for an uninformed, inexperienced woman 
to read before and after the advent of the first child? 
I would like to get the best modern authorities.” 
“GeEtTING Reapy To BE A MorHer,” by Caroline 
Conant Van Blarcom, author of the standard work 
“Obstetrical Nursing” (Macmillan), is practical, 
sympathetic without being sentimental, and wastes no 
words. It is in line with what is being done at 
maternity centres and may be used to supplement 
their instructions. Another is “The Prospective 
Mother,” by J. Morris Slemons (Appleton), of which 
a new edition was recently issued; it is scientific but 
not technical. “ Healthy Mothers ” is the latest addi- 
tion to popular works on prenatal care; it is by Dr. 
S. Josephine Baker, whose record of service to child 
hygiene and public health is nation-wide. It is the 
first of three little books and is followed by “ Healthy 
Babies ” and “ Healthy Children ” (all Little, Brown). 
The trained nurse is scarce out of the house before 
the young mother has come to look upon some book 
or books with the same affection with which a nervous 
non-swimmer regards the life-preserver under the 
berth. In my day it was scarcely legal to bring up a 
baby without Dr. Emmett Holt’s “ Care and Feeding 
299
-P-A-G-E-310
  300 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
of Children” (Appleton), and this, with Dr. Charles 
G. Kerley’s “Short Talks with Young Mothers” 
(Putnam), still holds a place of honor in thousands 
of young families, but there are now others to put with 
them, some of which I wish I had had. Not that I 
have the least fault to find with the resplendent 
product that issued from my own nursery — whether 
the resplendence was because of my efforts or in spite 
of them I do not ask — but because if I had had Mary 
E. Bayley’s “ Practical Talks on the Care of Chil- 
dren” (Dutton), or Dr. Alan Brown’s “ The Normal 
Child: its Care and Feeding” (Century), or Edward 
P. Davis’s “Mother and Child” (Lippincott), for 
instance, I should not have called up the doctor so 
many times to ask what to do for a perfectly well 
child. 
Just ahead of the time when you still know where a 
baby is if you have taken your eye off him, a sympa- 
thetic and practical book is waiting, “The Health of 
the Runabout Child,” by William P. Lucas, M.D. 
(Macmillan), which goes “from mother’s lap to the 
school gate.” Meanwhile get Maximilian Groszmann’s 
“ Parent’s Manual ” (Century, 2 vols.) into the house, 
for its studies of infant development are succeeded by 
thoughtful advice on the upbringing of little children. 
It is never too soon to read “ Child Training” and 
“Talks to Mothers,” by Angelo Patri (Appleton), for 
he has the understanding heart that mothers ought to 
have and clearer eyesight than some of us seem to 
have. “Outlines of Child Study,” a manual with 
excellent selective bibliographies, edited by Benjamin 
C. Gruenberg for the Federation of Child Study
-P-A-G-E-311
CHILDREN AND EDUCATION 301 
(Macmillan), is a guide for teachers or for clubs inter- 
ested in this study. 
“The Child at Home,” by Cynthia Asquith (Scrib- 
ner), is one of the most readable of the child-training 
books, and her methods, which are those of sweet 
reasonableness and getting the fun out of it, are as 
far as possible from the deplorable ones vaunted by 
the other Mrs. Asquith in her autobiography. But as 
the book is written for British conditions, involving a 
better system of nurses than we here enjoy, it is out 
of the reach of a struggling ménage.

CHILDREN’S READING 
THERE is no subject on which I receive more im- 
passioned letters than on children’s reading, and none 
on which advice printed in the Guide brings out more 
additional information from parents and guardians. 
It would take a book to hold a set of representative 
questions, and not to take too much space in this 
book I have selected those about which the most cor- 
respondence has centred. Before I begin I must make 
obeisance to Miss Annie Carroll Moore, whose 
“Roads to Childhood” (Doran) is so good a book 
of advice on children’s reading, with brief lists so 
well-chosen, that I refer to its pages people interested 
in starting children on a love of books. 
“What books should be ready for the-use of a two- 
year-old who is so fond of her ‘Real Mother 
Goose’ (Rand, McNally) that she soon will want 
more? The selection should go to her fourth year.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-312
  302 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
For the present and for some time to come, Beatrix 
Potter will fill the bill nicely. No child has had a 
fair chance in life who has not been given her 
“ Peter Rabbit,” “Two Bad Mice” and the long line 
that follows (Warne). Fortunately, most children do 
have that experience. But long before you have 
come to the end of the line, get “The Pinafore 
Pocket Story Book,” by Miriam Clark Potter (Dut- 
ton), an ideal collection of very short stories for little 
children and the perfect book for a family of assorted 
small sizes. Read aloud “Three Kittens See the 
World ” to the littlest child for a starter; pick out the 
ones about baby animals and very little children to 
read first. There are short poems with the right 
touch, and outline pictures for loving crayons to 
color —in short, a darling book. And right after it 
comes “The Giant of Apple Pie Hill,’ by the same 
author (Dutton) and off the same piece. 
At this early age pictures, rhymes and repetitions 
are what counts, and for subjects, those in the child’s 
own experience. Fairies come much later; they are 
wasted on a child to whom the world itself is fairyland, 
as it is if you are seeing it for the first time. Tell 
stories that begin “ when I was a little girl,” and sing 
rhymes and songs — always sing to babies, whatever 
and however you sing. Whatever poetry you read let 
it include “ Hiawatha’s Childhood ” and do not be sur- 
prised if the’ child suddenly begins to recite it; that 
poem is as catching as the measles. Read aloud 
Walter de la Mare’s “A Child’s Day” (Holt), and 
“Peacock Pie” (Holt), and of course “A Child’s 
Garden of Verse”; another lovely set of poems is
-P-A-G-E-313
  CHILDREN AND EDUCATION —— 303 
“Under the Tree,” by Elizabeth Madox Roberts 
(Huebsch), and Mrs. Schuyler Van Rensselaer’s 
“Many Children ” (Atlantic Monthly Press), with its 
delicate illustrations by Florence Ivins, is a real 
treasure. 
Keep the right picture-books on hand, beginning 
with Caldecott and Kate Greenaway, and if you invest 
in “An Argosy of Fables” (Stokes) collected by 
Frederic Taber Cooper, you will have not only a 
world-wide and age-old treasure of fables but the 
full-page animal pictures of Paul Bransom, thrilling 
enough. The most beautiful alphabet-book that I 
know, one so lovely that the edition de luxe is 
treasured by collectors, is the “ A B C Book ” by C. B. 
Falls (Doubleday, Page). This gorgeous production 
is printed in four colors from wood blocks, and I 
can testify that children respond to its charm as 
readily as experts, whether for the same reasons I 
know not. : 
From the picture-books one passes to “The 
Velveteen Rabbit,’ by Margery Williams (Doran), 
which is doubly beautiful from the pictures of William 
Nicholson, and if you think his stuffed rabbits are 
too emotional you do not know how emotional a 
stuffed rabbit becomes when properly loved by a little 
child. Some of Carl Sandburg’s “ Rootabaga Stories ” 
(Harcourt, Brace) can be read aloud to a four-year- 
old; the inimitable one about the wedding procession 
of the rag-doll could and should be read aloud to 
anyone at all — but I have found that in general this 
book is more popular with older readers. “The Me- 
moirs of a London Doll” (Macmillan) is an old, old
-P-A-G-E-314
  304 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
book discovered and republished, and though it is 
said to be for readers “ from six to eight ” my mother 
says this should be “ from six to eighty,” because any- 
one reading it finds that it brings back the long line 
of dear dead dolls that you thought you had forgotten 
—they all come back as this little creature tells her 
story. 
“Knee-High to a Grasshopper,” by Anne and 
Dillwyn Parrish (Macmillan), is a book that comes 
pretty early in a child’s reading and would last for 
some time; children find a peculiar charm in details 
of littleness, and this tiny man’s world is charmingly 
set forth. Most of these books are too new to have 
entered the regulation booklists; a good way to make 
sure that you have the “ regulation” books is to get 
the “Little Library ” or for the next older stage, the 
series of “ Children’s Classics” issued by Macmillan, 
books like Aesop and Gulliver in compact and portable 
volumes with colored pictures. 
Although this list is supposed to provide for the 
immediate needs of a young child, there is no reason 
why a young child should be given only the books 
immediately needed. Here is some good advice from 
a mother in Alabama whose little boy has at seven 
a “well-stocked library that he has not entirely 
grown up to.” 
“ During the years that he was a baby, every Christ- 
mas and birthday and Easter, when he was happy 
with a ten-cent toy, I gave him several of the more 
or less expensive books, realizing that the time was 
coming when he would ask for such expensive toys
-P-A-G-E-315
  CHILDREN AND EDUCATION 305 
that there would be. no surplus left for books. 
When one is five and wants a fire-engine automobile 
there isn’t a penny left over for a Jessie Wilcox 
Smith ‘ Child’s Garden of Verse, or a fairy-book il- 
lustrated by Rackham, and when one is six and 
wants a dog, or seven and wants a bicycle above 
anything else in the world and has already learned 
to ride one, it would be disappointing to get 
Howard Pyle’s King Arthur books. So during the 
stuffed-animal years Nicky received such trifling 
gifts, to his infinite satisfaction, and his book- 
shelves were filling even unto Van Loon and the 
holiday editions of ‘Kidnapped’ and ‘Treasure 
Island’ Many of the books he has not yet read, 
but he has handled them, studied the pictures, and 
is eagerly waiting the time when he will read 
them.” 
I was at some pains to get the reading-list of this 
little boy, after finding that he loved the books of 
Padraic Colum — for it is my firm belief that a col- 
lection of these works—from “The Children’s 
Homer” along the line to “The King of Ireland’s 
Son ” (Macmillan) — is one of the most potent forces 
for the early development of a love of simple, beau- 
tiful English and its use to convey sincere and beauti- 
ful thoughts. So I was glad to find that he had begun 
with just the picture-books above recommended, with 
Leslie Brook added, and that he adored — as I think 
all normal children do — “ The Story of Dr. Dolittle ” 
(Stokes), by Hugh Lofting. Of course they must 
have the two sequels to this delightful work, for there
-P-A-G-E-316
  306 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
is scarce any letting-down of the interest in either 
of them. He has read Selma Lagerlof’s “ Wonderful 
Adventures of Nils” (Doubleday, Page) two or three 
times and knows his “ Wonder Book” and “ Water 
Babies” — there is a new “Wonder Book” with 
pictures by Rackham (Doran) and a new “ Water 
Babies ” illustrated by Warwick Goble (Macmillan). 
He knows Howard Pyle from the “ Wonder Clock ” 
and “Pepper and Salt” (Harper) to his adored 
“Robin Hood.” The Burgess Bird and Animal 
Books (Little, Brown) are both treasured, and he 
loves “The Rose and the Ring” and “David 
Blaize,” but his mother is saving “ Alice,” for she 
thinks it should not come too early, and I agree with 
her. Also, do not expect a child to find this book 
humorous. Years after, he will read it again and make 
the surprised discovery that it was funny. “The 
Wind in the Willows,” by Kenneth Grahame (Scrib- 
ner), is another of the books that a child simply must 
have at least a chance to read some time during his 
childhood. There is an edition with Bransom’s pic- 
tures, too. “The Adventures of Maya the Bee,” by 
Waldemar Bonsels, (Seltzer), is a demure funny 
book that a child can read as well as a grown-up, and 
that indeed a child will read again when he is grown 
up—for it will be here then—and delight in the 
things he will find in it that he missed the first time. 
There is one old favorite I’ll never go back on, 
because my own child had it by heart, and that is 
W. A. Fraser’s “ Mooswa” (Scribner), and there is a 
fine new animal book by Samuel Scoville, “ Wild 
Folk ” (Atlantic Monthly Press), and from this house
-P-A-G-E-317
  
CHILDREN AND EDUCATION 307° 
comes also Ralph Bergengren’s lovely book, “ David 
the Dreamer.” Once a child gets into the fairy-tale 
age he will go through the literature of this subject 
like a forest-fire and ask only that he may get enough 
of it, but there are two new books that he should 
know about at this time of life. One is “The Black 
Cats and the Tinker’s Wife,” by Margaret Baker 
(Duffield), which is illustrated in silhouette and alto- 
gether lovely; it has the added value of being just the 
book for a convalescent child. The other is a com- 
posite volume called ‘“‘ Number One Joy Street ” (Ap- 
pleton), which is the joint production of Eleanor Far- 
jeon, Walter de la Mare, Rose Fyleman, and other 
true child-lovers, and has the charm that I remember 
used to attach to annuals like the British “Chatter- 
box” of my own childhood, only more so. 
Don’t read adventure stories out loud. It is 
pauperizing a child’s ingenuity. There is no better 
way of getting him to read for himself, once he has 
the trick of reading at all, than by giving him a fair 
start on a good yarn like “ The Mysterious Island ” 
or Samuel Scoville’s “ The Inca Emerald ” (Century) 
and then handing over the book. And mothers who 
love to read aloud to their children should remember 
that children ought to read aloud to mother part of 
the time. 
I am often asked for an easy star-book for little 
children. Gaylord Johnson’s “The Star People ” and 
“The Sky Movies” (Macmillan) will make the sky 
a part of the child’s world. And I am often asked 
for advice on puppet-plays and their production in 
the home, and am glad to tell of “ The Tony Sarg

  308 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
Marionette Book ” (Huebsch), which tells how chil- 
dren can make and manipulate a marionette show of 
their own, and gives two plays written by Anne Stod- 
dard with the needs of the young producer in mind. 
This little Alabama boy and his mother have had 
great success with “Snickerty Nick,” their puppet 
production of the play by Julia Ellsworth Ford pub- 
lished by Moffat Yard, and with a puppet dramatiza- 
tion of “ Epaminondas,” a story of a little colored 
boy and his mammy in Sara Cone Bryant’s “ Stories 
to Tell to Children” (Houghton, Mifflin). The little 
boy’s mishaps and his mother’s admonitions lend 
themselves delightfully to puppet production. 
SCARING THE CHILD 
Here is a letter from an indignant patron who had 
received from me a list of books for a child between 
five and six, to read aloud. 
“T saw that I wanted a book containing stories 
which would contain nothing to frighten her. I had 
had much difficulty in finding what I wanted because 
authors who write for children do not use simple lan- 
guage, in the first place, and one has to translate what 
they say into language the children can understand. 
Then they tell of fairies, good and bad, and goblins 
and giants, so that sensitive children are frightened 
to be alone or in the dark. . . . Well, I took your 
list to the public library and looked over what they 
had there, and they indorsed your suggestions and 
recommended that I get ‘The Dutch Twins ’ first. 
“So I went to Houghton, Mifflin’s near by and
-P-A-G-E-319
CHILDREN AND EDUCATION 309 
selected it from the set of ‘twin’ books, as the lady 
in charge seemed to think it was the simplest and 
best to start with. Full of confidence from a super- 
ficial looking over, I started it and read it through to 
my grandchild without having to translate the word- 
ing or change anything till the last chapter, when as 
I was reading along never suspecting any danger 
ahead I ran bang into the story of the man who took 
the children up into his attic and chopped them up 
and put the pieces into a pickle barrel in the cellar. 
“ Hereafter I shall buy no more books without read- 
ing them through myself. I cannot understand why 
authors of children’s books cannot write a simple, 
normal story and why people who are authorities on 
such books do not seem to realize the dangers which 
exist in their books.” 
I should say that a child so hyper-sensitive ought 
not to be read to at all. 
The longer I live the less reason I see for making a 
steady practice of reading to children, anyway, unless 
they have something the matter with their eyesight. 
Why not save it for getting over children’s diseases? 
I cannot remember my measles literature, but the 
bright feature of scarlet fever was that it lasted long 
enough for “ The Virginians,” “ Adventures of Philip,” 
and “Vanity Fair.” As I recall my beginnings, my 
parents sang to me a great deal, recited any amount 
of poetry, and when desired to “tell what it says” 
in my picture books, read it for me over and over 
again. 
But a book, it appeared from their conduct, was 
something you had to get by yourself. You opened it, 
 
-P-A-G-E-320
eee 310 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK | 
mysteriously happy, so that when addressed you 
seemed to come back from somewhere. I tried to 
produce this effect, not always with the book right 
side up; it -must have been at an early age, for, by | 
five and a half, my family discovered that I had 
been reading for some time. I have an idea that if 
I had been conscientiously read to I would have “ ex- 
ploded into reading” much later. 
But the question of terror in children’s stories gets 
at the subject from another angle. As I recall my 
early terrors, they always came to me by word of 
mouth, never through anything I read, and I had the 
run of a library from which even Grimm was not shut 
out. There was a tone in my mother’s voice reading, 
“ Give me three grains of corn, mother,” that almost 
broke my heart. I know a little boy who cries at 
“Little Brown Brother” and two babies that have 
always sobbed at the sound of a violin. Fear lives 
deep down under the mind. The idea of death or of 
bloodshed did not break my heart because it never 
really got into my head. In that story of St. Nicholas 
and the boys in the pickle tub the point was not that 
they were cut up, but that in the end they popped 
out all put together again. This was manifestly as 
things should be, like the comic strips in which one 
falls three stories and just bounces. 
And when I did shiver over adventures, like those 
of Curdie in the mine in “The Princess and the Gob- 
lin,” it was with that blessed sense of duality that a 
child of eight or nine so savors — the power reading 
gives of taking part in desperate deeds and knowing fixed your eye upon the page, and became at once 
 
-P-A-G-E-321
    CHILDREN AND EDUCATION 311 
all the time that you are perfectly safe. But if some 
one had read these same stories aloud to me, some 
one with an adult experience with death and pain, 
this experience could very well have colored their 
tones and started within me vibrations of vicarious 
fear. 
This is an important matter, this relation of chil- 
dren’s fears to children’s reading, and one that deserves 
all the pains one must take to come to some working 
basis on which to deal with it. We have dug our- 
selves out of that deplorable time when we brought 
up children on poems like Jane Taylor’s “ Poor Little 
Baby ” — though it was not so long ago that an emi- 
nent French composer set to music the lullaby that 
goes “Sleep, my darling, and remember that every 
naughty deed you have done to-day has added another 
thorn to the Saviour’s crown; now, go to sleep?” 
Then came the reaction, when all the fairy tales 
were decarnalized and when I remember I was asked 
by the mother of one of my Sunday school pupils not 
to tell the story of the crucifixion because it was “so 
brutal.” Now we are, I think, trying to get nearer 
equilibrium; we realize that to frighten a child is 
not only to make a wound but to leave a scar, but we 
are beginning to realize also that we have not always 
known just what does and does not frighten a child. 
Here is a little girl who, in my opinion, will be 
better left to get her folk-lore by herself in the 
natural course of reading to herself; there are lots 
of things to do at her time of life besides listening to 
stories, and by the time she is ready for “ The Chil- 
dren’s Homer,” in which there are a number of people
-P-A-G-E-322
  312 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
handy with weapons, or “ Treasure Island,” or “ Peter 
Pan,” she will quite likely have developed a certain 
spiritual resistance. And some spiritual resistance 
really is necessary, if we are going to live with our 
eyes open. 
§ 92 
DEVELOPING A TASTE 
“Tam the father of a healthy boy of fifteen. His 
mother and I are not ‘literary, but we have a 
healthy interest in life and enjoy the Atlantic. 
The boy gives promise of being a rather fine type 
of man: his scholarship is excellent and he is a 
natural leader, a first-class Boy Scout and mountain 
climber, having for his age an unusual appreciation 
of the beauties of nature. The point at which he 
needs help is in the matter of forming a taste for 
good reading as one of the durable satisfactions 
of life. 
“1 can’t see that he cares for poetry at all and fiction 
makes little appeal to him. Of his ‘ required read- 
ing’ last year he cared litile for ‘A Tale of Two 
Cities’ and nothing for ‘The Odyssey’? He has 
enjoyed ‘Sherlock Holmes, ‘Two Years Before 
the Mast’ (says it’s true), and ‘Treasure Island, 
‘ Kidnapped’ and ‘David Balfour’ His interest 
in girls is developing slowly and he has no use for 
love-stories — calls them ‘ mush’ 
“What books can his mother and I read aloud with 
him this winter — books we all will like?” 
Here the problem is to help a boy not to clean 
out the junk-pile that often gathers around a “ born
-P-A-G-E-323
  CHILDREN AND EDUCATION 313 
reader,” but to furnish a spacious, well-proportioned 
and bare mental apartment with what will make it a 
good place to live in. 
The first step is to determine which of the popular, 
rapidly moving writers that an active boy is apt to 
like will lead him naturally in the direction of better 
writers. Second-raters in literature lead up or down. 
“Sherlock Holmes” decidedly leads up. It suggests 
a starting-point for a series of winter evenings with 
Conan Doyle’s historical novels, “ Micah Clarke” or 
“The White Company,” full of stirring incident, de- 
pendable as to history, sound in workmanship. Mase- 
field’s “ Jim Davis” follows naturally, and once 
caught by the magic of his style there is his “ Lost 
Endeavor,” a story of peril that puts young or old 
on the heights. Love of nature and something of 
the naturalist’s spirit — it calls for both —lead a boy 
toward W. H. Hudson; I should begin with “Idle 
Days in Patagonia” because it has such good animal 
stories, but most advisers would tell you to start with 
“Far Away and Long Ago.” Anyway, have that 
ready, and “A Little Boy Lost.” He has already 
had all the boy-Stevenson: “The Master of Ballan- 
trae” for instance, so far as a boy reader is con- 
cerned, complicates a slashing story with psychologi- 
cal subtleties, and the sympathy is divided, which a 
young person always resents. Sympathy goes all one 
way or the other, gloriously undivided, in “ The Three 
Musketeers,” which may be one reason why boys like 
it so much. 
Of course he thinks love stories are mush, but for 
all that a slight sprinkle of girl won’t ruin a story
-P-A-G-E-324
  314 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
for him along about now. Only the girl must stay in 
the background; there must be no manner of doubt 
that the story is about the hero. The girl is the 
admiring audience; she is there to be rescued and 
things like that. “The Virginian” is as far as a 
normal North American boy will go with romance at 
this time of life. “Captain Blood” has the right 
idea— plenty of action and the lady taking her 
chance along with the rest. Sabatini does not write 
for boys but boys really get the most out of him. 
Almost all Kipling is taken gladly by this age, “ Cap- 
tains Courageous” and “ Kim” especially, and the 
popularity of “ Stalky and Co.” is high. Some of the 
best American literature a boy will devour without 
knowing it is literature at all—‘“ Tom Sawyer” and 
“The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,” for instance. 
I should have thought Edgar Lee Masters’s “ Mitch 
Miller” would have come along after “Tom Saw- 
yer,” but it seems to be more read by grown-ups. 
About this time a boy’s nerves are so solid he 
likes to take a chance on them with ghost stories and 
tales of the grotesque. It looks to me as if the 
middle teens were now or never with Poe. But not 
his poetry. My own recipe for getting a taste for 
poetry on the palate of a youth who has shown no 
sign of it is to start with a fairly long narrative 
poem with a strong plot-interest. I owe to Walter 
Scott’s “Lay of the Last Minstrel— begun in des- 
peration one rainy day on a farm— my discovery, 
still at an early age, that there was some sense in 
poetry after all. I know of not a few adults who 
were led along by the story in Masefield’s “ Ever-
-P-A-G-E-325
    
CHILDREN AND EDUCATION 315 
lasting Mercy” or “Widow in the Bye-Street” 
until just before the close they found to their sur- 
prise that they had been reading poetry, and in every 
case they are reading poetry still. Macaulay’s 
“Lays of Ancient Rome,” John Hay’s “ Pike County 
Ballads,” the verses of Robert Service —this is as 
far as most of our boys go of their own accord up 
the slopes of Parnassus. If they suddenly develop 
an interest in lyric verse, extending perhaps to its 
construction, their parents are about to have other 
than literary problems on their hands. 
Returning for the moment to books that lead up 
or down, Joseph Altsheler is one of the small but 
highly important group of writers for young people 
who supply an impulse toward reading for pleasure 
strong enough to carry the reader past their own 
works. Louise Alcott often does this for girls. I once 
knew a girl of fourteen who had never of her own 
impulse read through a book; she could read, of 
course, and she had begun books now and again and 
even finished those prescribed for her by the school 
that she attended, but she had never gone through 
one on her own steam. I told her perplexed parents 
to try her on “ The Story of Dr. Dolittle,’ by Hugh 
Lofting (Stokes), and one week later received a de- 
mand from her, relayed through them, for “ another 
book exactly like ‘ Dr. Dolittle.’”” That was two years 
ago and she has been reading more or less ever since. 
She will never be a book worm or what you call a 
“natural reader,” but has found out that reading need 
not be a task. Often enough it takes some one 
book like that to give a child the initial shove through 
 
-P-A-G-E-326
    
316 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
the door of delight. Samuel Scoville’s “Inca 
Emerald” (Century) and the rest of his adventure- 
natural-history tales are enough to give a pretty strong 
shove. Joseph Altsheler will do for the boys of this 
generation what Cooper would do for them if they 
could be induced to read him. For let the parent 
take it to heart—so far as young people are con- 
cerned, Cooper and Scott are past praying for. 
So much for advice, now for a warning. Make it 
your business to find out at least a year ahead — 
earlier would be better — what are to be your son’s 
“required readings” in school and read them aloud 
with him for the story, for fun, for anything in the 
world but a task, before the classroom gets a chance 
at them. Thus only can you save for him some of 
the masterpieces of English prose and poetry. I have 
never re-read a line of any piece of literature I read 
for the first time in college preparatory work. Even 
the most inspired and inspiring of teachers cannot 
avert the danger, for with the best will in the world 
the student cannot be allowed to form his own opin- 
ions about the poem or novel, or even take the opinion 
of his teacher; he must in a measure forecast and 
adopt the opinions of the board of examiners. This 
may be the reason, rather than grubbing methods of 
study, why gifted pupils hate books they studied in 
this way; they resent the selling-out involved. Read 
in the family circle as any other book is read aloud, 
the boy hears let us say “ The Vicar of Wakefield ” as 
Goldsmith meant him to hear it, comes to the class 
with a great advantage over the others, and may 
take out of it something that examinations cannot
-P-A-G-E-327
  CHILDREN AND EDUCATION 317 
take away. Otherwise the literature comprised in re- 
quired readings will be thrown to the wolves to ensure 
getting past the gate of the university.

NATURE BOOKS 
What books shall I take to the country for the use 
of children interested in all natural objects to be 
found there? 
“Everypay Mysterres: Secrets of Science in 
the Home,” by Charles G. Abbot (Macmillan), comes 
into play as well in town as out, but the “ Young 
People’s Shelf of Science ” which it begins, and which 
is edited by the author of “ Creative Chemistry,” has 
for its second volume “Dwellers of the Sea and 
Shore,” by William Crowder. “ Little Sea Folk” by 
Tsien Nathalie Gaylord (Little, Brown) is a book of 
stories that may be taken to the beach by one in 
charge of even younger children, up to say twelve. 
The field books published by Putnam are pocket sized 
and shaped; their information is reliable, and in ar- 
rangement most convenient; there are those by F. 
Schuyler Mathews, “ Field Book of American Wild 
Flowers,” and of “ American Trees and Shrubs,” and 
“Wild Birds and Their Music,” with two on birds 
and on flowers for younger enthusiasts. Then there 
is one that I wish I had had when I used to prowl 
about with a hammer looking for rocks, only it did 
not come out until this year, Frederic Brewster 
Loomis’s “ Field Book of Common Rocks and Min- 
 
-P-A-G-E-328
    318 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
erals,” in the same series and like the others with 
beautiful color plates and pictures. Another volume 
is Frank E. Lutz’s absorbing “ Field Book of Insects,” 
and “Taming the Wildings” by Herbert Durand, is 
for lovers of wild flowers, shrubs and ferns who en- 
gage year after year, as summer residents will, in the 
adventure of making things brought in from wood and 
field grow happily in a corner of the garden. “ Na- 
ture’s Craftsmen,” by Inez McFee (Crowell), is a 
book of stories about the building of spiders, moles, 
ants and many other mechanics that a child may 
watch in action; it is the kind of book brought into 
existence by the demands of parents and children for 
“true stories of wonder.” For these, however, no 
one can match J. H. Fabre; what could be more 
dramatic than “This Earth of Ours” (Century), 
which though written for young people deals with 
biology in the large, or the long line of minute and 
devoted studies of the home-life of insects, “ The Life 
of the Spider,” “The Life of the Bee,” “The Life of 
the Caterpillar,” “The Life of the Grasshopper,” 
“ The Mason-Bees,” “ The Mason-Wasps ” or even the 
story of the shy and sinister scorpion, latest of these 
volumes (Dodd, Mead publishes these). I think I 
have normally less interest in insects than in almost 
anything else, but let me read ten pages of Fabre and 
I feverishly pursue their lives and loves through the 
whole book and leave off determined to spend hours 
every day watching bugs. 
The large and beautifully illustrated volumes of 
Doubleday, Page’s “Nature Library ” will be con- 
stantly consulted by young naturalists who are so
-P-A-G-E-329
CHILDREN AND EDUCATION 319 
fortunate as to have a line of them in a country-house 
library, not only the old favorites, “ Bird Neighbors ” 
and “Nature’s Garden,” but the “ Butterfly Book,” 
the “ Frog Book,” the “ Moth Book,” the brilliant 
“ Mushroom Book ” and the fairylike one on “ Mosses 
and Lichens.” Doubleday, Page publishes also the 
convenient set of “ Pocket Nature Guides” and the 
“ Pocket Nature Library.” A book to companion a 
forest-lover and take a department not otherwise pro- 
vided for is “ How to Know Wild Fruits,” by Maude 
Gridley Peterson (Macmillan), a guide to plants when 
not in flower and an introduction to the woods in 
Fall. “The Fern Lover’s Companion,” by George 
Henry Tilton (Little, Brown), is a small beautifully 
illustrated book for field use. 
“The Star People,” by Gaylord Johnson (Macmil- 
lan), now comes in a dark-blue box with its companion 
“The Sky Movies,” and together or apart make the 
ideal sky guide for very little children. It is a won- 
derful thing to give a little child the freedom of the 
sky; you never know until something brings it out 
later in life, how many of them are afraid of the 
distance, the aloofness, the unearthly quality of the 
stars. I think the very title of Mrs. Martin’s excel- 
lent book for young people, “ The Friendly Stars ” 
(Harper), has had much to do with its wide success. 
Another good book on astronomy for the home ob- 
server is “ The Splendors of the Sky,” by Isabel M. 
Lewis (Duffield). “ Making the Weather,” by Alex- 
ander McAdie (Macmillan), is one of the Outing 
Handbooks, telling about weather forecasts; as there 
is so much more weather in the country it is a good  
-P-A-G-E-330
Se ne ae 320 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
book to have on hand. Not to go farther up this 
road, the American Library Association publishes a 
| pamphlet list of books on science for the lay reader. 
Even very little children have reliable and readable 
books about natural science: the “‘ Hexapod Stories,” 
by Edith M. Patch (Atlantic Monthly Press), read 
aloud well to very young listeners, and the second 
volume, “Bird Stories,’ and Edward W. Frentz’s 
“Uncle Zeb and his Friends” (Atlantic Monthly 
Press), are good rainy-day reading for a somewhat 
older child. For any age the same house issues 
Samuel Scoville’s nature sketches, “ Everyday Adven- 
tures” and “ Wild Folk.” I am especially fond of a 
series of books about small animals, wild but not too 
wild, by Joseph Wharton Lippincott, “ Gray Squir- 
rel,” “Red Ben the Fox,” “Bun the Wild Rabbit ” 
and “Striped Coat of Skunk” (Penn), for they 
are as real as the photographs that illustrate them. 
“The Burgess Bird Book” and the corresponding 
books for animals and for flowers (Little, Brown), 
are loved by little children. Waldemar Bonsel’s de- 
lightful “Maya the Bee” (Seltzer) belongs with the 
romances, but it is hard to stop short of these in 
naming nature stories for children’s reading, one 
merges so gently into the other —nor indeed should 
I be too careful in keeping them apart at that age.

FRENCH FOR LITTLE CHILDREN 
“What is a good French language primer for use in 
instructing a very little child?” 
 
-P-A-G-E-331
  CHILDREN AND EDUCATION 321 
I NEVER tried to teach French to little children, but 
I have seen so many of them “ explode into reading ” 
English with the assistance of Beatrix Potter that I 
don’t see why it would not be a good idea to give 
the French translations of her immortal works a 
chance. There are already four of them (Warne) : 
“Pierre Lapin,” who is of course Peter Rabbit; 
“ Jeannot Lapin,” the Gallic counterpart of the ador- 
able Benjamin Bunny; “ Poupette-a-l’Epingle,’ who 
is Tiggy Winkle, and “Sophie Canetang,” who is 
Jemima Puddleduck. Also there is “Little Black 
Sambo” in French as “Histoire du Petit Négre 
Sambo ” (Stokes), which children seem to love as well 
in one language as another. 
But no very little child should get a language out 
of books. What are their ears for? 
My files hold a confirmation of my belief that read- 
ing aloud to little American children in French would 
help to start them happily on the language. In a 
letter from a mother in Texas, she told me: “ My own 
six-year-old’s best-loved books are in French. We 
began with Mme. de Ségur’s books when she was four, 
translating every sentence as we went along. Even 
that could not spoil ‘Les Malheurs de Sophie’ or the 
rest of that series, ‘Les Petites Filles Modéles’ and 
‘Les Vacances.’ We’ve read them so many times 
that they don’t have to be translated now, and we 
have found a very happy way of learning an idio- 
matic French without lessons. In fact French seems 
to be preferred to English, but then children naturally 
prefer foreign languages and learn them so easily. 
“Memoires d’un Ane’ and ‘Nouxeaux Contes des
-P-A-G-E-332
  322 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
Fées,’ by Mme. de Ségur, are- very good too. Mme. 
de Pressensé has written just as interesting stories, 
but they are about children of a newer France; Mme. 
de Ségur’s children belong to the old régime and her 
books are better to begin with, because they come in 
the Bibliotheque Rose — such pretty books with so 
many pleasing old-fashioned pictures.” 
The Boutet de Monvel colored picture-books have 
a beauty and charm to which children instantly 
respond; Anatole France’s “Our Children” and 
“ Boys and Girls” with these pictures are published 
(Duffield) in English translations, and a story re- 
cently brought back into print, “ Susanna’s Auction ” 
(Macmillan), has his funny black and white pictures. 
This is a vivacious tale that you would not think 
children would like if you did not know that they 
always delight in stern morality applied to other 
children. 
“Plays for Children in French and English,” by 
Caroline Thomason (Penn), has “La Belle et la 
Béte,” “ Barbe Bleue,” “Cendrillon” and other old 
friends, with the equivalent English speeches alter- 
nating on the page; there are pictures and directions 
for nursery or school performance with old French 
songs given for incidental music. That brings me to 
the most important feature of all, which is that the 
child should from the earliest possible moment hear 
French sung and sing the children’s rounds and songs 
like “ Nous n’irons plus au bois” and “ Sur le pont 
d@’ Avignon.” The repeating couplets and the singing 
quality are both features that make for language 
learning.

§ 95 
“I would like a twenty-book collection on education, 
suitable for a complete library for the reader with 
an interest in pedagogy or as a starting point for 
a professional collection.” 
For the nature and function of education, “ Democ- 
racy and Education,” by John Dewey (Macmillan), 
David Snedden’s “Educational Sociology” (Cen- 
tury), Franklin Babbitt’s “ The Curriculum ” (Hough. 
ton, Mifflin). 
For historical background, Joseph K. Hart’s 
“Democracy in Education ” (Century), Elwood Cub- 
berley’s “ Readings in the History of Education” 
(Houghton, Mifflin). 
For practical problems of education, M. V. O’Shea’s 
“ Everyday Problems in Teaching” (Bobbs, Merrill), 
Sheldon Davis’s “‘ The Work of the Teacher ” (Mac- 
millan), and Colin Scott’s “ Social Education ” (Ginn). 
For modern developments, especially in the applica- 
tion of scientific measurements, Robert Rusk’s “ Ex- 
perimental Education” (Longmans), Sidney and 
Luella Pressey’s “ Introduction to the Use of Standard 
Tests” (World Book Co.), Herbert Woodrow’s 
“ Brightness and Dulness in Children” (Lippincott), 
“ How to Measure,” by G. M. Wilson and K. J. Hoke, 
(Macmillan), ‘“‘ The Measurement of Intelligence,” by 
L. M. Terman (Houghton, Mifflin), John and Evelyn 
Dewey’s “Schools of To-morrow” (Dutton), “The 
Gary Schools: a General Account,” by A. Flexner and 
F. P. Bachman (General Education Board, New 
York). 
 
-P-A-G-E-334

For theoretical basis of education, including its 
foundations in other sciences, “The Philosophy of 
Education,” by H. H. Herne (Macmillan), “The 
Principles of Education,” by W. C. Ruediger (Hough- 
ton, Mifflin). 
For its psychological phases, “ Educational Psy- 
chology,” by D. Starch (Macmillan), E. L. Thorn- 
dike’s “ Educational Psychology: Briefer Course ” 
(Teacher’s College), “ Psychology of High School 
Subjects,” by Charles H. Judd (Ginn).

THE TREND OF MODERN EDUCATION 
“The educational department of a woman’s club 
wishes to outline a course of reading by which to 
obtain the more recent opinions of prominent edu- 
cators of the United States on the trend of modern 
education.’ 
“ MopeRN DEVELOPMENTS IN EDUCATIONAL PRAc- 
ticE,” by John Adams (Harcourt), a book that will 
give teacher or parent a good idea of how these cur- 
rents are setting, discusses tests and standards of 
measurement, the drawing away from class-teaching, 
the contributions of the Dalton plan, the Gary system 
and the “play way,” the project method, the use of 
psychoanalysis and the matter of free discipline. 
Taking these in turn, the most important book on the 
first subject for the layman’s use is “ Intelligence 
Testing,” by Rudolf Pintner (Holt), an account of 
what is being done in our schools and colleges and
-P-A-G-E-335
  
CHILDREN AND EDUCATION 325 
wherever intelligence tests are now used, in language 
that anyone can understand. “ Methods and Results 
of Testing School Children,’ by Evelyn Dewey and 
others (Dutton), and the books of Lewis Terman. 
“The Intelligence of Children” and “ The Measure- 
ment of Intelligence” (Houghton, Mifflin), are 
valuable to an understanding of this important 
development. 
“ Education on the Dalton Plan,” by its originator, 
Helen Parkhurst (Dutton), is a complete explanation, 
with practical illustrative material. “The Play 
Way,” by H. Caldwell Cook (Stokes), and “The 
Project Method of Teaching,” by John A. Stevenson 
(Macmillan), inform the reader on these develop- 
ments. As for psychoanalysis, which is yet on the 
outer edge of pedagogy, a first book for teachers is 
George N. Green’s “ Psychoanalysis in the Class 
Room” (Putnam), and one has been recently pub- 
lished by Seltzer, “The New Psychology and the 
Teacher,” by H. C. Miller; neither has altogether 
broken with the old order. 
To these I should add a new book that will be 
useful to the mother who directs the first steps of 
her children toward an education, as well as to the 
teachers and students for whose use it was no doubt 
intended, “The Child’s Mind and the Common 
Branches,” by Daniel W. La Rue (Macmillan). It 
shows how the mind of the little beginner regards 
and approaches school habits and subjects, from 
penmanship and spelling to arithmetic and the arts 
and crafts. “The Child and His School,” by Gertrude 
Hartman (Dutton), is in the main a broad and well-
-P-A-G-E-336
326 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
chosen bibliography; a school library that wishes to 
keep up with the interest aroused by progressive text- 
books will do well to go by its suggestions for outside 
reading; there is another volume now to go with it, 
“Home and Community Life” (Dutton). “A 
Mother’s Letters to a Schoolmaster” (Knopf) out- 
lines the sort of school many a little boy besides this 
mother’s son would like to attend. It is a beautiful 
school and I am glad the little boy isn’t going to 
get it, because whatever he gets in the way of an 
education he is going to repudiate at the age of twenty 
and wish he had had the other kind. 
Whatever you read, do not leave out “ Moonlight 
Schools,” by Cora Wilson Stewart (Dutton), the 
story of the establishment and maintenance of night 
classes for adult illiterates, first in Kentucky among 
the mountain people, then in Tennessee and the Caro- 
linas, Alabama and other states. I am not ashamed 
to say that I found my throat badly choked more than 
once in reading this brave and cheerful record. Once 
interested in this phase of education you will find 
good collateral reading in Katharine Grey’s novel, “A 
Little Leaven ” (Lippincott), for she comes from that 
part of the world and knows what she is talking 
about. Nor must I leave out Lucy Furman’s “The 
Quare Women” (Atlantic Monthly Press), about 
what goes on at Hindman Settlement School in 
Kentucky — and if you send to the Caney Creek 
Community Centre, Pippapass, Kentucky, for their 
“ News Letter ” that will tell you what they are doing 
about it. 
If this course were not restricted to education in
-P-A-G-E-337
  CHILDREN AND EDUCATION 327 
the United States I should include in this list “The 
New Education in Europe,” by Frederick W. Roman 
(Dutton), based on three years special investigation 
in leading foreign educational centres; “The Reform 
of Education” (Harcourt, Brace), by the Italian 
Giovanni Gentile; and the new edition of Margaret 
McMillan’s “The Nursery School” (Dutton). This 
is in its way as moving as Mrs. Stewart’s book, for 
the English type of nursery school, like the French 
Maternelle, is distinctly a slum institution. 
I am often asked for a work on moral education 
covering in modern methods the field that used years 
ago to go down on the curriculum as “ morals and 
manners.” Dr. Henry Neumann, instructor in ethics 
and in education at the Ethical Culturé School, New 
York City, has just prepared an important contribu- 
tion to this literature — which was much in need of 
important contributions —in “ Education for Moral 
Growth” (Appleton). It will be useful to teachers in 
every field of work, draws its illustrations from ex- 
periences from kindergarten age to college years, and 
provides a short selective reading-list for each 
chapter.

PHYSICAL EDUCATION

328 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
“A Manual of Corrective Gymnastics,” by Louisa 
Lippitt (Macmillan), not only states the case for this 
important department, but develops it in a series of 
exercises from those for posture to those that correct 
special weaknesses or maladjustment. The pictures 
and directions are so clear that they could be used 
without supervision, were it not — as this book wisely 
emphasizes — that much of this sort of work should 
be done only under the direction of an orthopedic 
surgeon. 
The subject in general is treated in “ The Adminis- 
tration and Organization of Physical Training,” by 
Jesse F. Williams (Macmillan), and “ The Pedagogy 
of Physical Training,” by C. Ward Crampton (Mac- 
millan). Various features are covered in William 
Skarstrom’s “Gymnastic Teaching,” published by 
the American Physical Education Association, by 
Clelia Mosher’s “ Health and the Woman Movement ” 
(Woman’s Press), and by Florence Bolton’s practical 
collection of “Exercises for Women” (Funk and 
Wagnalls). 
Sperling’s “The Playground Book” (Barnes) has 
detailed instructions for various activities. In this con- 
nection the publications of the Play-ground Associa- 
tion of America, 315 Fourth Avenue, New York, are 
in demand. The famous collection of “Games for 
Playground, Home and School,” by Jesse Bancroft 
(Macmillan), is always useful, and though “ Spontane- 
ous and Supervised Play in Childhood,” by Alice Cor- 
bin Sies (Macmillan), is concerned only with very 
little children, it is an especially sympathetic presenta- 
tion of the subject.

“The Dance in Education,” by Agnes and Lucille

book on this subject, treating it in all aspects and 
giving not only very good illustrations, but the com- 
plete musical settings necessary. With every dance 
or exercise, references are given for the study of 
appropriate literature, sculpture and music.

MODERNISM AND FUNDAMENTALISM 
“I am sure that we are on the verge of another 
awakening of popular interest (which let us hope 
will be followed by greater popular knowledge) in 
those schools of theological thought labelled, for 
the moment, liberal and fundamentalist. What 
books will stimulate and reward this interest?” 
  I NEED not search for the book to begin this list. 
It is either on the shelf that holds those volumes for 
which I have an especial respect, or it has been car- 
ried away from it by someone with just such an 
interest as this. It is “ Evolution and Christian 
Faith,’ by H. H. Lane, Professor of Zoology at the 
University of Kansas (Princeton University Press), 
written because his students formally petitioned for 
a course of lectures answering their questions: “ What 
is the theory of evolution and what are the important 
facts on which it is based; and what effect has the 
acceptance of that theory upon one’s views of the 
Biblical account of creation and of the Christian 
religion? ” There is the right ring about that demand 
and the right tone in the reply, which is a straight- 
forward, simply-worded statement of the issues in the 
latest of the great “conflicts” that Professor Lane 
says have never been between science and religion, 
but between ignorant tradition and true knowledge.

  334 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
The process of adjustment and its attendant bitter- 
nesses, so humiliating to one who loves both truth and 
mankind, would, I firmly believe, be hastened if the 
general reading public could be brought not only to 
read this book, but what is more difficult and even 
more important, to read it in the spirit in which it is 
written. It will comfort many a bewildered believer 
and strengthen many an idealist. 
In the frame of mind thus induced these books will 
be welcomed: “ The Theory of Evolution,” by W. B. 
Scott (Macmillan), “Evolution,” by Geddes and 
Thomson (Holt), and “ The Doctrine of Evolution,” 
by H. E. Crampton (Columbia), all of a general 
introductory nature. Then V. L. Kellogg’s “ Human 
Life as the Biologist sees It” (Holt), “The Direc- 
tion of Human Evolution,” by E. G. Conklin (Scrib- 
ner), and the new edition of his textbook, “ Heredity 
and Environment in the Development of Men” 
(Princeton University Press). Henry Fairfield 
Osborn’s “Men of the Old Stone Age” (Scribner) 
continues to thrill new readers and old; it is by 
no means a new book, but the demand for it at 
libraries and reading-rooms never subsides. There 
are this year a number of new books on anthro- 
pology and primitive culture, popularly written and 
of sound scholarship, like Clark Wissler’s ‘“‘ Man and 
Culture” (Crowell). 
There are special reasons just now why so many 
are asking that the tenets of Christian faith be de- 
fined; for this “An Outline of Christian Theology,” 
by William Newton Clarke (Scribner) is appropriate. 
A series of lectures was given at General Theological 
 
-P-A-G-E-345
  
RELIGION 335 
Seminary, New York, by Oliver Chase Quick, and 
printed as “ Liberalism, Modernism and Tradition ” 
(Longmans), to aid in reconciling modern and tra- 
ditional modes of thought. Other thoughtful and 
stimulating books are Henry Fairfield Osborn’s 
“Evolution and Religion” (Scribner), and “ Because 
Men are Not Stones,” by Jabez Sunderland (Beacon). 
I am so often asked for the name of a book on com- 
parative religions, one that will inform a reader on 
the fundamentals of faith the world over and time 
through, that I am glad that Dr. Robert Hume of 
Union Theological Seminary has not only written a 
brief, lucid, sympathetic study and comparison of 
“ Living Religions” (Scribner), but provided it with 
an admirable reading-list. 
§ 99 
THE LIFE OF CHRIST 
“What is the best life of Christ from a historical or 
biographical standpoint, suitable for reading by 
a layman?” 
A coop introduction to the life of Christ is “The 
Life of Jesus,’ by Rush Rhees (Scribner). The 
Appendix gives the names of a number of books of 
reference indicated for further reading. The chap- 
ters on the life and ministry of Christ in “New 
Testament History,” by G. W. Wade (Dutton), are 
not only sound scholarship but stimulating to further 
reading. 
Giovanni Papini says in the introduction to his 
“ Storia di Cristo,” “If Christ is to remain alive in 
 
-P-A-G-E-346
  336 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
the life of men it is necessary to resuscitate him from 
time to time; not to color him with the dyes of the 
present day, but to represent with new words, with 
references to things now happening, His eternal truth 
and His never-changing story.” This impulse, always 
strong in pictorial art in epochs when faith is strong, 
had shown itself not a few times and in many coun- 
tries before Papini’s book swept Italy and in transla- 
tion as “ Life of Christ ” (Harcourt) became in a few 
months one of the most widely read books in Amer- 
ica. “The Man Jesus,” by Mary Austin, (Harper), 
is one of these; such an impulse undoubtedly underlies 
“ Lives” like those of Bouck White and Upton Sin- 
clair. Rollin Lynde Hartt has just written “The Man 
Himself, the Nazarene” (Doubleday), which will be 
heartily welcomed by those who are not in sympathy 
with Papini’s methods. Readers of Papini’s attack 
upon “lives of Jesus written for pious readers,” in 
the introduction above quoted, should remember that 
his reading was conducted under different conditions 
from those under which books like any of the above 
and not a few others were written. No one who has 
loved that life and tried sincerely to tell why he loved 
it, has written a book without some beauty, some 
dignity, some value.

THE TEACHINGS OF JESUS 
“What books conform to the title ‘The Teachings of 
Jesus’ and are (1) for adults (2) uncomplicated 
with theology?” 
 
-P-A-G-E-347
  
RELIGION 337 
Tue teachings of Jesus are so interwoven with his 
life that it is hard to separate them and harder to see 
why anyone should wish to, so in all the books on 
this list there is a certain amount of biography and 
in all the lives of Christ something that would qualify 
for this reader’s requirements: “The Ethical Teach- 
ing of Jesus,” by C. A. Briggs (1904); “ The Ethics 
of Jesus,” H. C. King (1910) ; “ The Theology of the 
Gospels,” J. Moffat (1913); “The Kingdom and the 
Messiah,” E. F. Scott (1911); “The Teaching of 
Jesus about the Future,” H. B. Sherman (1909) ; 
“The Theology of the New Testament,” G. A. Bous- 
set (1906); and “ Jesus in the Experience of Men,” 
T. R. Glover (1921). H. H. Wendt’s “ The Teaching 
of Jesus” (1892) is one of the most thorough and 
detailed discussions of the subject. While all these 
books could be read with interest by the layman, they 
are also adapted to the uses of the clergy or of 
teachers. 
For the personal book of devotion or for a state- 
ment of first principles intended for individual read- 
ing, Clutton-Brock’s heartfelt little book, “ What is 
the Kingdom of Heaven?” (Scribner) is loved by 
many here and in England. In “The Simple Gos- 
pel ” (Macmillan) Harold S. Brewster “seeks to in- 
terpret literally what the New Testament says is the 
teaching of Jesus.” In one chapter of W. Garrett 
Horder’s “The God that Jesus Saw” (Pilgrim) he 
has the courage to protest against leading children 
through Old Testament theology instead of “ direct 
to the higher vision of Christ.” “The Lord of 
Thought,” by Lily Dougall and C. W. Emmett
-P-A-G-E-348

CHURCH HISTORY 
“What is a reliable and readable church history in one 
volume, and what works on epochs of church his- 
tory would be of interest and value for a layman to 
read in connection with it?” 
“ A History oF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH,” by Prof. 
Williston Walker of Yale (Scribner), is an excellent 
all-round book; it presents to the general reader in 
one volume what the theological student is accus- 
tomed to looking for in the famous and monumental 
“History of the Christian Church” (Scribner), 
by Dr. Philip Schaff and Dr. David Schaff, in seven 
volumes. 
Dr. McGiffert’s “ History of Christianity in the 
Apostolic Age” (Scribner), “The Ancient Catholic 
Church,” by Dr. Robert Rainy (Scribner), and “ The 
Latin Church in the Middle Ages,” by André Lagarde 
(Scribner), the two volumes by Dr. Thomas Lindsay 
of Glasgow on “ The Reformation in Germany,” and 
“The Reformation in Lands beyond Germany ” 
(Scribner), cover the subject in chronological develop- 
ment. For one of a philosophic turn of mind — and 
one taking such a course of reading as this would be 
apt to be of that turn—Dr. McGiffert’s “ Protes- 
tant Thought Before Kant,” and Edward Caldwell
-P-A-G-E-349
RELIGION 339 
Moore’s “ Christian Thought Since Kant,” will be of 
great interest (Scribner). ‘“ The Church in America,” 
by William Adams Brown (Macmillan), brings the 
history to the present time; it is a picture of present- 
day American Protestantism by a historian who is 
open-minded and hoping for unification. 
§ 102 
“I am looking for a book dealing with the foundation 
of the Christian Church and the growth and de- 
velopment of her dogma, one to supplement 
Renan’s “ Apostles” and “ Influence of Rome.” 
Tue latest of these is Kirsopp Lake’s “ Landmarks 
in the History of Early Christianity (Macmillan), 
an accurate, readable, popular summary of his 
scholarly series in several volumes, “The Beginnings 
of Christianity,” Dr. Arthur McGiffert’s ‘“ History 
of Christianity in the Apostolic Age” (Scribner) is 
a standard work generally regarded with high ap- 
proval, and so is “The Apostolic Age in the Light 
of Modern Criticism,’ by Prof. James Hardy Ropes. 
“From the Gospel to the Creeds” is a small book 
by Dr. William O’Sullivan (A. U. A.). 
§ 103 
DEVILS IN LITERATURE 
“Is Andreyev’s ‘ Anathema’ a development of the 
Mephistopheles symbol or a creation distinct and 
different from the evil spirits of Goethe’s ‘ Faust, 
Byron’s ‘ Lucifer’ and other embodiments of the 
same mythological figure? What other distinctive 
devils are there in modern literature?”
-P-A-G-E-350
  340 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
I rake quite literally Anathema’s own statement 
that he is “a mind that is searching for the Truth,” 
“the wise Anathema, longing for Truth.” He is, so 
far as I can see, pure intellect, accurate and material- 
istic; his emotional reactions are those of intellectual 
curiosity. He is alternately boastful — “I have pene- 
trated the meaning of all things, the laws of num- 
bers are known to me and the book of Fate is open to 
me ”—and sick with longing “endlessly and ter- 
ribly ” for the truth. He can conceive it only as a 
name, something definite and communicable in 
definite terms. 
When the Guardian of the Entrances tells him that 
“there is no name for that which you ask, no number 
by which to count, no measure by which to measure, 
no scales by which to weigh that which you ask,” he 
is utterly baffled, being incapable of imagining any- 
thing not to be measured, weighed, or counted. He is 
not even a tempter, save as intelligence always is. He 
plays a fair game with the soul of David Leizer. In 
an honest attempt to work out a problem of good and 
evil, he endows a poor old Jew, dreaming and God- 
haunted, with great wealth and suggests that he divide 
it among the poor. When for a momennt it looks as 
if the problem were going to work out im terms of 
demonstrable good, Anathema is sincere in his admira- 
tion of David. When the money is so spread out 
that no one is richer for it, when David, flying from 
the disappointment, dies under their stones with his 
last gesture one of giving, Anathema sees nothing but 
foolishness in what has been so patently ineffective. 
He reports to the Guardian that “ David has mani-
-P-A-G-E-351
RELIGION 341 
fested the powerlessness of love and created a great 
evil that could be numbered and weighed,” and is 
again baffled and cast down by the unreasonable reply 
that though this is all true and the numbers do not 
lie, “having died in numbers, David has attained 
immortality.” 
Anathema is all brain— that is why he has such 
deep wrinkles — and life has a way of taking an un- 
fair advantage of pure reason. He is “the honest 
Anathema ” who is being deceived eternally, “ death- 
less in numbers, but as yet unborn to life,” eternally 
restless, superficial and in self-defence flippant. The 
mind has to be when it tries, all by itself, to work 
out anything about the nature of life. 
Anathema is my favorite devil, and modern litera- 
ture is full of them. Andreyev’s “ Anathema” (Mac- 
millan) will bear many rereadings; it is one of the 
world’s great plays. 
There is a chatty sort of devil in “The Brothers 
Karamazov ”; he talks as much as everybody does in 
that long-winded family. Russian devils are many 
and various; the most famous is the one who plays 
the title rdle in Lermontov’s “The Demon.” On this 
the poet worked all his life; the scene is laid in the 
Caucasus and the story is pervaded with the spirit of 
the Orient. Sologub made a celebrated devil in his 
novel whose name in English is “ The Little Demon.” 
It is the story of a half-crazed official, Peredonov, and 
the mean little squeaking imp that embodies for him 
the dull and dirty monotony of his desk-ridden exist- 
ence. Gogol’s “ Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka ” 
has a fine robust devil in it, with his sweetheart,
-P-A-G-E-352
  
  342 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
the witch. Franz Molnar’s hero in “The Devil,” 
a play so popular in New York that two companies 
were playing it at once on Broadway, was no more 
than the conscience turned inside out; what you leave 
out of your prayers, Molnar thinks, are prayers to 
the devil. Goethe’s “Geist der stets verneint ” and 
Marlowe’s familiar spirit in “ Dr. Faustus ” have been 
subjects of plenty of explanation, and so have the 
Byronic revolters and the leading man of “ Paradise 
Lost,” but not so much has been written about the 
demure and sardonic Lucifer of Anatole France’s 
“ Revolte des Anges,” though he is neatly set forth by 
the author so well fitted to be the devil’s advocate. 
There is even a trace of sulphur in ©’s noble book 
about revolutions and their heroes, “The Interpre- 
ters” (Macmillan), when Leroy (who might, with a 
little coaxing, be made to serve for Bernard Shaw) 
talks of what his Dark Angel tells him. There is a 
sentimental devil in Marie Corelli’s “Sorrows of 
Satan,” and a grotesque one in Poe. He is a perfect 
gentleman, who gives Don Juan a gentleman’s chance, 
in Rostand’s posthumous play, “ La Derniére Nuit de 
Don Juan,” and all he does with Don Juan after all 
is to set him in a Punch and Judy show to squeak his 
legend to a laughing world. For that matter, Ibsen’s 
Button Moulder in “ Peer Gynt” would do for a 
devil, if there were not a more familiar figure later on 
in the person of “ The Lean One.” To save her people 
Countess Cathleen sells her soul to travelling devils 
in Yeats’s play, thereby involving the Irish National 
Theatre in theological difficulties, if one may trust 
George Moore. Carl van Vechten talks about devil-
-P-A-G-E-353
  
RELIGION 343 
worship in his novel “ Peter Whiffle” (Knopf), and 
his admired Arthur Machen is an authority on the 
subject. For that matter, a book on it came out a 
year or so ago, “ The Witch Cult in Western Eu- 
rope” (Oxford Press), by M. A. Murray, and whether 
or not all its conclusions are supported by ironclad 
evidence, it is certainly mighty thrilling reading. 
The most uncanny devil in modern fiction, and the 
one that I confess keeps me guessing in vain, is in the 
novel by C. F. Ramuz called “ The Reign of the Evil 
One,” in the European Library, published by Har- 
court. In this a mysterious stranger comes to live 
in a mountain village and works a spell that seizes 
upon the reader, whether he quite knows what it is 
all about or not. And in “ Georgian Stories” (Put- 
nam), J. D. Beresford has a devil resulting from 
group hallucination, in “ The Criminal.” Space shuts 
the door on other fine contemporary fiends, letting 
James Branch Cabell slide through at the last moment 
his galaxy of demons in “The High Place” (Mc- 
Bride).

§ 104 
A DRAMA LIBRARY 
“A club wishes a list of books to serve as a reference 
library on the drama — historical, technical, criti- 
cal—and for purposes of club study.” 
For a cornerstone, Felix E. Schelling’s “ English 
Drama” (Dutton), and the two octavo volumes of 
his “Elizabethan Drama: 1558-1642” (Houghton, 
Mifflin), with the chapters on the drama in the 
“Cambridge History of English Literature” (Put- 
nam, 14 volumes). The fifth and sixth of these are 
devoted entirely to Elizabethan drama, and special 
articles appear elsewhere in this and in the corre- 
sponding work, the “ Cambridge History of American 
Literature” (Putnam). Benjamin Brawley’s “Short 
History of English Drama” (Harcourt), a textbook 
useful for rapid reference, has an unusually large 
bibliography of plays and books about them, includ- 
ing series like the famous “ Mermaid Series ” (Scrib- 
ner), “the best plays of the old dramatists”; the 
“ Belles Lettres Series” (Heath), edited by George 
Pierce Baker; the “Masterpieces of the English 
Drama,” edited by Felix Schelling with introductions 
by famous critics (American Book Co.) ; the admir- 
able and inexpensive “ Riverside Literature Series ” 
(Houghton, Mifflin); the books to be found in the 
faithful “ Everyman’s ”; in the inexpensive “ Modern

Library” for contemporary Continental Dramas 
(Boni) ; the various annotated single-volume Shakes- 
peares such as the Yale (Yale University Press), the 
Tudor (Macmillan), the Arden (Heath), the new 
Hudson (Ginn), and the pure pages of Rolfe’s edition 
of Shakespeare (American Book Co.). From these 
the students of the history of English dramatic 
literature may select according to his needs. 
The library should certainly provide itself with the 
two large illustrated volumes of Arthur Hornblow’s 
“History of the Theatre in America” (Lippincott), 
indispensable for study of our theatrical development, 
and accompany it with Arthur Quinn’s collection of 
“ Representative American Plays ” (Century), twenty- 
five from early ones like “The Contrast” and 
“Fashion” to the present day. “ Representative 
Plays of American Dramatists” is a collection in 
several large volumes edited with copious and schol- 
arly notes by Montrose J. Moses (Dutton). There 
are two very important new books on our drama and 
its production, “A History of The American Drama 
from the Beginning to the Civil War” by Arthur 
Quinn (Harper), which is to be followed by his book 
on our later drama, and Oliver Sayler’s provocative 
studies of new movements in “Our American 
Theatre” (Brentano). Its lists of important pro- 
ductions and repertoires are valuable for reference. 
The “Contemporary Drama” series published by 
Little, Brown has a valuable study of ‘“‘ The Contem- 
porary Drama of England,’ by Thomas H. Dickin- 
son, and corresponding volumes, each the most useful 
single volume on its subject for the American student,
-P-A-G-E-359
  THE DRAMA 349 
on “The Contemporary Drama of Ireland,’ by 
Ernest Boyd, or “ France,” by Frank Chandler, and 
of “Italy,” by Landor MacClintock, with more of 
them promised. The same publishers issue “The 
American Dramatist,” by Montrose J. Moses. Bar- 
rett H. Clark’s “Authors of British and American 
Drama” (Stewart Kidd) is full of valuable sug- 
gestions. Storm Jameson’s “Modern Drama in 
Europe” (Harcourt, Brace), not a book to be read 
before one has read the plays it discusses, stimulates 
thought upon those that one has read and tends 
toward a keener sense of values. Dr. Isaac Gold- 
berg’s “ The Drama of Transition” (Stewart Kidd) 
surveys the stage of the present day, almost of the 
present hour, in Europe and America, laying stress 
upon the plays and playwrights that illustrate the 
tendencies of the times; many of these are new to 
American readers. ‘“ Aspects of Modern Drama,” by 
Frank Chandler (Macmillan), is an excellent book 
to keep ready to look up the plots of plays; it man- 
ages, in the course of its chapters on various subjects, 
to sketch the outlines of a great number of modern 
dramas. 
The works of Clayton Hamilton —‘“ The Theory 
of the Theatre,” “ Problems of the Playwright,” and 
“Studies in Stagecraft” (Holt)—must on no 
account be omitted: they are based on wide knowl- 
edge and presented with delightful ease. His latest 
book, “ Seen on the Stage” (Holt), takes in as recent 
developments as Russian and Jewish art theatres in 
‘America, and the vogua of St. John Ervine. Alex- 
ander Woollcott’s “Shouts and Murmurs” (Cen-

tury) and “Enchanted Aisles” (Putnam), go on 
from this point, vivacious, enthusiastic reviews 
of current plays and players. “The Flower in 
Drama,” by Stark Young, (Scribner), lifting itself 
above other books written by favorite newspaper 
critics, by reason of its depth and beauty of thought, 
bids fair to enter our literature. At any rate, Stark 
Young will enter it somehow, that’s clear. I am 
taking it for granted that the members of this asso- 
ciation will have already provided themselves with 
the works of James Gibbons Huneker (Scribner), in- 
cluding “ Steeplejack ” and the “ Letters” and going 
back to “Iconoclasts” ;—also with E. E. Hale’s 
“Dramatists of To-day,” Rostand, Hauptmann, 
Sudermann, Pinero, Shaw, Phillips and Maeterlinck, 
with an appendix of first productions up to 1911, in- 
cluding those in the United States (Holt). E. F. 
Jourdain’s inclusive “ Drama in European Theory 
and Practice” (Holt), which in 170 pages covers 
many things from Aeschylus to Drinkwater. 
On the little theatre movement, for a history of its 
ideals, Thomas Dickinson’s “The Insurgent Theatre ” 
(Huebsch) ; for its history up to 1917 and its reper- 
tory, Constance D’Arcy Mackay’s “ Little Theatre in 
the United States” with appendices on The North- 
ampton Municipal Theatre, New York’s New Theatre, 
etc. (Holt). I have elsewhere named several books 
on community production and kindred subjects. For 
actual use, Clarence Stratton’s “ Producing in Little 
Theatres ” (Holt). For the commercial stage and its 
methods of production as well as for much about the 
construction of the modern theatre, Arthur E, Krows’s  
-P-A-G-E-361
  THE DRAMA 351 
“ Play Production in America” (Holt). For the more 
advanced theories and practice of stagecraft — on 
which it is important that intelligent theatregoers 
should be informed, lest the development of the art 
be unduly impeded — “ The Theatre of To-Morrow,” 
by Kenneth Macgowan (Boni), “Continental Stage- 
craft,” by Kenneth Macgowan and Robert Edmond 
Jones (Harcourt, Brace), and Hiram Moderwell’s 
“The Theatre of To-day ” (Lane), which will inform 
the reader also about the construction of the modern 
playhouse. I have elsewhere spoken of the works 
of Sheldon Cheney, but I must not fail to advise the 
student to consult the Theatre Arts Magazine and 
its files. See also the section of this book on 
Costume Books. 
For the art of acting, begin with Louis Calvert’s 
“Problems of the Actor” (Holt), the best book in 
the English language on this subject to come from 
beyond the footlights. Brander Matthews’s “On 
Acting” (Scribner) is still available and interesting. 
Arthur Hornblow’s “ Training for the Stage ” (Lippin- 
cott) is intended for those thinking of entering the 
profession; for those high in it or for those watching 
them, the chapters on acting in “The Flower in 
Drama” above mentioned. 
The complications of rights and royalties, to say 
nothing of the limitations of space, make me stop 
before I begin to recommend plays for production by 
amateurs — although in spite of efforts to disclaim 
responsibility in this way, I must continually do so in 
the columns of the Literary Review or by mail. But 
so many of the volumes I have named — and in par- 
 
-P-A-G-E-362
352 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
ticular Mr. Stratton’s “ Producing in Little Theatres ” 
— have excellent descriptive lists, that these are not 
needed here. The various anthologies of plays will 
be found not only valuable but economical in price 
and shelf-space: I need name only such tried favor- 
ites as “ Chief Contemporary Dramatists” first and 
second series, “ Chief European Dramatists” and 
“Chief Elizabethan Dramatists” (all Houghton, 
Mifflin) ; “ Representative British Dramas: Victorian 
and Modern” (Little, Brown); the three collections 
of “ Representative One-act Plays” for America, for 
British and Irish authors, and for continental authors 
(Little, Brown) and Stewart Kidd’s “ Contemporary 
One-act Plays” and “Contemporary One-act Plays, 
1921-1922.” 
I must, however, call attention to three volumes, 
“A Treasury of Plays for Women,” edited by Frank 
Shay, “ A Treasury of Plays for Children,” by Mont- 
rose Moses, and “A Treasury of Plays for Men,” by 
Frank Shay (Little, Brown), than which it would be 
difficult to find three collections more useful for the 
particular purposes for which they are intended. A 
noteworthy book of plays for men or boys only is 
Beulah M. Dix’s “ Allison’s Lad” collection (Holt). 
Many one-act plays for little theatres appear in the 
monthly magazine The Drama and some in the 
Theatre Arts Magazine. 
As for playwriting, I believe you can cover the 
field with fewer books than for any other subject of 
similar magnitude and importance. There are of 
course a great number of books on the making of 
plays, but two are indispensable, Prof. George Pierce 
 
-P-A-G-E-363
  
  THE DRAMA 353 
Baker’s “ Dramatic Technique ” (Houghton, Mifflin), 
and Percival Wilde’s “The Craftsmanship of the 
One-act Play ” (Little, Brown), and the two together 
could be stretched to cover the whole subject. The 
beginner will call for Fanny Cannon’s brief manual, 
“ Do’s and Don'ts for the Playwright ” (Denison), and 
the student refuse to go on without William Archer’s 
“ Play Making ” (Small, Maynard), but I shall have 
to stop with these. 
It is often difficult to find whether a play has been published, 
especially as it may only be had in some book of collected plays. 
Frank Shay’s roor PLAYS FOR AMATEURS contains the con- 
tents of the various collections. Both the Drama League of 
America (59 E. Van Buren St., Chicago) and The New York 
Drama League (39 W. 47 St.) issue cheap and helpful annotated 
lists of plays. 
To find a play quickly or special Drama Books, it is best to 
inquire at Drama Boox Suops of which Mr. Shay’s book con- 
tains a list. The Drama Magazine (59 East Van Buren Street, 
Chicago) prints the following list of them:

READ-ALOUD PLAYS 
“A club wishes suggestions as to plays to be read 
aloud by members to whom parts are assigned, and 
advice on this kind of entertainment.” 
Tue reading of plays by groups of good readers, 
who have studied their parts with care but made no 
attempt to commit them to memory, has become a 
feature of programs given by play-committees of clubs 
or by similar organizations, and may be thoroughly 
enjoyable entertainments. A tragedy or a “ problem 
play” is obviously not suited to this sort of pre- 
sentation; there is something funny in the very idea 
of two people sitting comfortably in their chairs and 
dying to slow music; but a light-running comedy, a 
fantastic play, especially one with an allegorical 
 
-P-A-G-E-365
THE DRAMA 355 
quality, or a drama whose interest is largely in its 
dialogue, can be given a fair chance in this way. 
The usual custom is to seat the persons who are to 
read at one end of the room, in a curving row, and 
to leave some space clear before them unless they are 
seated on a platform — which it is better not to have 
too high. A stage is suggested without being imi- 
tated, and if the shaded lights are placed beside 
the readers and the rest of the room left in shadow, 
something the same suggestion of stage-lighting is 
made. One person reads the stage directions and the 
parts are assigned, the readers who will take part in 
each act take their places when it begins, and their 
“entrances” are indicated by the directions-reader. 
Printed plays in which explanatory stage-directions 
are a feature, like those of Shaw, Barrie, or Gran- 
ville Barker, come out well in this way, but the play 
in which readers and audience seem to have the best 
time of any of those given is Lennox Robinson’s 
“The White Headed Boy” (Putnam). This buoy- 
ant Irish comedy, with its delightful stage-directions, 
has been reported to me over and over again as 
successful in a reading-performance. So is Mary 
Carolyn Davis’s “The Slave with Two Faces” 
(Arens), a poignant one-act that acts beautifully 
whether for amateurs or professionals, and bears 
reading well. Edna St. Vincent Millay’s “ Two Slat- 
terns and a King” (Stewart Kidd) is a delicious 
trifle, written for college production and sure to 
please. Her “ Aria da Capo,” one of the most search- 
ing plays of the war, though in the guise of a deli- 
cate Harlequinade, could be read well this way by a  
-P-A-G-E-366
  356 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
group with poetic feeling. “On the Clouds,” by 
Benavente (Scribner) has been thus given. Gilbert 
Cannan’s “ Everybody’s Husband” (Huebsch) is a 
pretty fantasy, often given by amateurs. I should 
think that the title play in Maurice Baring’s “ His 
Majesty’s Embassy ” (Little, Brown) would be good 
for this purpose; it is a laughable survey of the 
small-talk and general social and personal intrigue 
that gathered in diplomatic circles when there was 
nothing much to do. Glaspell and Cook’s “ Tick- 
less Time,” which has a philosophic idea back of 
its admirable fooling, the fantasy “Manikin and 
Minikin,” by Alfred Kreymborg, Constance D’Arcy 
Mackay’s Eighteenth Century dialogues, “The Beau 
of Bath” (Holt), Colin Campbell Clements’s “ Colum- 
bine,” are good to be read as well as acted. Dun- 
sany’s “If” (Putnam) is ideal for such presentation; 
the audience has to do all the scene-shifting that 
would be required for stage performance. I should 
think Percy Mackaye’s “ The Scarecrow” would be 
especially good for a reading-program. 
This is as far as I can go with recommending plays 
to amateurs for production, because I cannot advise 
in matters of copyright, royalties and fees for stage 
performance. There are excellent lists of plays in 
Stratton’s “ Producing in Little Theatres,” of one-acts 
in Percival Wilde’s “ The Craftsmanship of the One- 
act Play,” and in, not a few of the other books sug- 
gested in the production list. The Theatre Guild’s 
plays are almost all printed; they publish a “ Book 
Shelf” list which comprises practically every play 
that they have given. These, with the “ Drama
-P-A-G-E-367
  
  THE DRAMA 357 
League” series of plays (Doubleday), are useful for 
club reading or study. 
The Library School of the University of Wisconsin, 
Madison, Wis., has been especially successful. in 
conducting group readings and has done so for some 
years past. An article on “How to Conduct a 
Dramatic Reading,’ by Mary E. Hazeltine, which 
appeared in their Library Bulletin for January, 1915, 
gives complete directions for this sort of presentation, 
and plays are lent in sets, though only in Wisconsin 
and for formal reading before an audience; the list 
of these plays, both long and one-act, ranges from 
classic to contemporary drama and shows how im- 
portant such readings as these may be. 
§ 106 
“I am gathering books on educational dramatics, 
including community and pageant production.” 
“Tue Dramatic Instinct IN CHILDREN,” by El- 
nora Whitman Curtis (Houghton, Mifflin), is an excel- 
lent educational work. The introductions to Knicker- 
bocker’s selected “ Plays for the Classroom” (Holt) 
and to Helen Louise Cohen’s “One-Act Plays by 
Modern Authors ” (Harcourt) and the notes on pro- 
duction are to facilitate their performance in schools. 
Sheldon Cheney’s “The Open Air Theatre” (Ken- 
nerley) and Frank Waugh’s “The Outdoor Theatre ” 
(Badger) bear on this subject, and Arvold’s “The 
Little Country Theatre,” which tells of the experiences 
in play writing and production at the College of Agri- 
culture in North Dakota, is especially good for those  
-P-A-G-E-368
358 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
attempting to reach a rural audience (Macmillan). 
The publications of the Dakota Playmakers, at the 
University of North Dakota, at Grand Forks, are of 
high value, especially the pamphlet that gives the 
plan of their stage. But the best book about college 
little-theatre production is “Carolina Folk Plays” 
(Holt), whose introduction is by Prof. F. M. Koch, 
who organized the Dakota Playmakers and followed 
this by a similar work at the University of North 
Carolina. These one-act dramas are of unusually 
high merit, and one at least, “The Last of the Low- 
ries,” by Paul Green, should be more generally recog- 
nized as one of the best of our one-acts, as dramatic 
literature or for actual production. 
Coming to books for the guidance of amateurs 
engaged in putting on plays, the most practical one 
for work with children is Constance D’Arcy Mackay’s 
standard “Costumes and Scenery for Amateurs,” 
whose illustrations are remarkably good, with her 
guide-book “How to Produce Children’s Plays” 
(Holt). These will do for many purposes and should 
be in the library of any school where entertainments 
are given. Barrett H. Clark’s “How to Produce 
Amateur Plays ” (Little, Brown) is precise and prac- 
tical in those details on which the amateur so desires 
information, and so is Emerson Taylor’s “ Practical 
Stage Directing for Amateurs” (Dutton). The 
organizer or friend of a little theatre should make 
himself familiar with “ Producing in Little Theatres,” 
by Clarence Stratton (Holt), a work that covers the 
subject more thoroughly than any other and brings 
it nearer to the present moment; it will be useful  
-P-A-G-E-369
  THE DRAMA 359 
to groups working for aesthetic advancement or for 
educational dramatics, on which it devotes a section. 
“The Community Playhouse in America,” by C. J. 
Goveia (Huebsch), is a guide for the beginner, based 
on wide experience and directed along the lines on 
which groups in process of organizations are especially 
in need of guidance. “Dramatics for School and 
Community,” by Claude Merton Wise (Stewart 
Kidd), is by a professor of dramatic literature who 
is also a little theatre director; it includes pageants, 
goes into careful detail in matters of costume, scenery 
and lighting, and has an excellent reading-list that 
includes magazine articles on dramatization in school 
work. For this subject E. V. Knickerbocker has pre- 
pared “ Plays for Classroom Interpretation” (Holt), 
which shows how a class in literature can make the 
work vastly more vivid and valuable than mere read- 
ing-aloud could do, and with no more paraphernalia. 
His “ Twelve Plays” (Holt) offers a more varied col- 
lection. Louise Burleigh’s “ The Community Theatre ” 
(Little, Brown), and Constance D’Arcy Mackaye’s 
“The Little Theatre in the United States” (Holt) 
were written at the height of the movement and are 
now interesting mainly as records. Mary M. Russell, 
who has prepared “ Dramatized Missionary Stories ” 
and “ Dramatized Bible Stories,” has a handbook on 
“How to Produce Plays and Pageants” (Doran) 
that will be useful especially to Sunday-schools, 
church societies and similar organizations, whose 
problems call for special attention. The Woman’s 
Press has a great number of plays and entertainments 
suitable for such presentation, and books on pro-

duction, like “National Costumes of the Slavic 
Peoples,” by Margaret Pratt, with drawings accurate 
in detail, materials indicated and a chart of colors 
from which to get the exact shades for reproduction. 
Elizabeth E. Miller’s “The Dramatization of Bible 
Stories ” (University of Chicago) contains eleven tales 
arranged for production by large or small groups. 
For children’s pageants Percival Chubb’s “ Festi- 
vals and Plays” (Harper) is a foundation work 
widely used. Constance Mackaye’s “ Patriotic Plays 
and Pageants for Young People” (Holt) are popular 
and not difficult to give; all her plays for children 
act well, and some, like “ The House of the Heart,” 
are so sincere and sweet that the children them- 
selves are moved to give a touching performance. 
Other books for Pageant Producers are “ The Tech- 
nique of Pageantry,” by Linwood Taft (Barnes), 
Crawford and Beegle’s “Community Drama and 
Pageantry” (Yale U. P.), “Shakespeare for Com- 
munity Players,’ by Roy Mitchell (Dutton), 
“Dramatized Rhythmic Plays,’ by J. N. Richards 
(Barnes), and “The Rhythms of Childhood,” by 
Crawford and Fogg (Barnes), must be added to a 
pageant equipment, with the latest and most compre- 
hensive treatment of “English Pageantry,” from 
folk-customs to the latest spectacular productions, 
by Robert Withington (Harvard University Press). 
A new annotated list of “ Plays for High Schools 
and Colleges,” compiled by a committee of which 
Clarence Stratton is chairman, can be bought for a 
quarter from the National Council of Teachers of 
English, 506 W. 69th Street, Chicago.
-P-A-G-E-371
THE DRAMA 361 
For pageants on a large scale and for community 
production, the works of Percy Mackaye hold a high 
place: “Sanctuary,” a bird masque (Stokes), with 
colored photographs by Arnold Genthe; the Shake- 
speare Tercentenary masque, “Caliban: by the 
Yellow Sands” (Doubleday); “The Evergreen 
Tree” (Appleton), a masque for Christmas; “The 
Pilgrim and, the Book,” which is published by the 
American Bible Society, and “The Will of Song” 
(Boni), prepared in collaboration with Harry Barn- 
hart and of interest in connection with community 
singing. His books on the subject are “The Civic 
Theatre” (Kennerley), “The Playhouse and the 
Play” (Macmillan) and “Community Drama” 
(Houghton). The Theatre Magazine for May, 1921, 
and April, 1923, has lists of music for plays and 
pageants by Roland Holt, the second list being 
exclusively for those American themes. 
Books on aesthetic stagecraft, such as “ The Theatre 
of To-morrow,” by Kenneth Macgowan (Boni), and 
“ Continental Stagecraft ” (Harcourt, Brace), by Ken- 
neth Macgowan and Robert Edmond Jones; 
the works of Gordon Craig, “On the Art of the 
Theatre” (Browne, Chicago) and “ Towards a New 
Theatre ” (Dutton), and Oliver Sayler’s new book on 
Max Reinhardt and His Theatre (Brentano’s) —all 
* these will in time be added to the library of the 
intelligent and far-seeing student of community 
drama presentation.

§ 107 
“A club asks for material in the way of contemporary 
plays for reading and study with outlines for the 
latter.” 
Tuts is best provided by books with collections 
of plays, a feature that will appeal to any leader of 
a drama class that has had to struggle with the 
problem of getting copies enough to go around. 
Arthur Quinn’s selection of “Contemporary American 
Plays” (Scribner) has “Why Marry?”, “The 
Emperor Jones,” “ Nice People,” “The Hero,” and 
“To the Ladies,” with topics for discussion suggested 
for each of them, and a good list of other collections 
of American plays. Margaret Mayorga’s “ Repre- 
sentative One-Act Plays by American Authors” 
(Little, Brown), was one of the first of these collec- 
tions and remains one of the best. “The Atlantic 
Book of Modern Plays,’ edited by Sterling 
Leonard (Atlantic Monthly Press), is another 
book of high value for club purposes or for 
the general reader. For foreign plays two books 
would cover an entire season: “ Representative 
One-Act Plays by Continental Authors,” selected 
by Montrose Moses, and “ Representative One-Act 
Plays by British and Irish Authors,” selected by 
Barrett Clark, both published by Little, Brown. Th 3 
notes and book-lists in these are useful for study 
purposes. B. Roland Lewis’s “ Contemporary One- 
Act Plays” (Scribner) is another book to carry a 
club through a season; it has eighteen plays by Eng- 
lish, Continental, and American writers, the American
-P-A-G-E-373
  THE DRAMA 363 
choice being especially strong and unhackneyed; the 
introduction to this book would be a boon to a pro- 
gram committee. George P. Baker’s selection of 
“Modern American Plays,” and the two volumes 
edited by Helen Louise Cohen for use in schools, 
“One-Act Plays” and “Longer Plays” (Harcourt), 
have good notes for study. The two plays by 
George Middleton and Guy Bolton, “ Polly with a 
Past” and “ Adam and Eva” (one vol., Holt), with 
“Dulcy,” by Kaufmann and Connolly (Putnam), 
are but three that may be added to reading-lists 
of stage-successes, which are now being published in 
great numbers. Two poetic plays that repay read- 
ing in class are Charles Henry Meltzer’s translation 
of Hauptmann’s “Sunken Bell” (Doubleday) and 
Brian Hooker’s of Rostand’s “ Cyrano de Bergerac ” 
(Holt). 
A club should provide itself with the new “The 
Play of To-day,” a study manual of play structure 
by Elizabeth R. Hunt (Dodd). It is admirably 
adapted to club needs.

“What plays, accessible in English, have been written 
about famous women, as Drinkwater’s ‘ Mary 
Stuart?’” 
StepHEN Purtuip’s “Herod and Mariamne” is 
faithful to the facts as given by Josephus and in the 
doomed Queen presents one of the most convincing 
women of his stage. David Pinski has written a 
series of five plays around “King David and his
-P-A-G-E-374
  364 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
Wives,” a sort of Biblical “Anatol,” according to 
Dr. Goldberg; they are translated from the Yiddish 
and published in one volume (Huebsch). His 
“Mary Magdalene” is reviewed in Dr. Goldberg’s 
“Drama of Transition” (Stewart Kidd). Paul 
Heyse has a “ Mary Magdalene” and so has Maeter- 
linck. Wilde’s “Salome” made the lady what she 
is to-day, not what she is in the Bible. Andreyev’s 
“Samson in Chains” is published by Brentano. 
Pilate’s wife appears in Masefield’s “ Good Friday ” 
and in Ridgely Torrance’s “ Plays for a Negro 
Theatre” in the drama “Simon the Cyrenean ” 
(Macmillan). “The Terrible Meek” (Harper), 
Charles Rann Kennedy’s drama that plays in the 
dark, shows in the moment’s illumination at the close 
that the scene has been Calvary. Masefield’s lately 
published tragedy in verse, “A King’s Daughter ” 
(Macmillan), is about Jezebel and Jehu. 
“ Virginius,” by James Sheridan Knowles (1820), 
was long a favorite on our stage; famous women of 
the classic period appear in recent drama in Mase- 
field’s “‘ Tragedy of Pompey ” and Phillips’s “ Nero.” 
Philip Moeller’s “ Helena’s Husband” (Knopf) is 
burlesque of the college theatrical type, but Shaw’s 
“Caesar and Cleopatra” (Brentano) is an entirely 
reasonable presentation of Cleopatra in the kitten 
stage, Shakespeare’s being the subsequent cat. Arthur 
Symons has a play about “Cleopatra in Judea” 
(Lane). 
Janauschek played an English version of Schiller’s 
“Mary Stuart” in this country, unless I am much 
mistaken. Elizabeth figures largely in it, but not so

sympathetically as in Clemence Dane’s “ Will Shakes- 
peare” (Macmillan). ‘Anne Boleyn,” by Henry 
Hart Milman, Dean of St. Paul’s, held the stage for 
years after its first production in 1826. Tennyson’s 
“Queen Mary” is a fine portrait of a difficult sub- 
ject, and there are several historic women in 
“ Becket.” Mary Fitton is in several plays besides 
“Will Shakespeare.” “Florence Nightingale,” by 
Edith Reid (Macmillan), is kinder than the portrait 
in “Eminent Victorians.” The last play of Jose- 
phine Preston Peabody, “ Portrait of Mrs. W.” 
(Houghton), is a touching study of Mary Wollstone- 
craft, surrounded by other famous figures of her day. 
Queen Victoria and Mrs. Gladstone are present to 
the life in Lawrence Housman’s “ Angels and Minis- 
ters” (Harcourt), a set of one-acts. 
Percy Mackaye’s “ Jeanne d’Arc,” Shaw’s “ Saint 
Joan,” Schiller’s “ Jungfrau von Orleans,” with a 
number of plays and playlets written at the time of 
her festival, Philip Moeller’s piquant “Madame 
Sand” (Knopf), the old “ Duchess de la Valliere ” 
of Bulwer Lytton, the adaptation of “The Birthday 
of the Infanta” of Wilde, in “ Portmanteau Adapta- 
tions” (Stewart Kidd), and Shelley’s “The Cenci” 
have for leading characters women known to Euro- 
pean history. Shaw’s “Great Katherine” and 
Meltzer’s “ Big Kate” had to do for Russia in Eng- 
lish drama until a translation of “Tsar Fyodor ” (in 
“Moscow Art Theatre Plays”) gave us a noble 
image of Empress Irene. There are not many plays 
about women in American history, and still fewer in 
which both history and drama are sound. Drink-

water’s “Abraham Lincoln” has an honest picture 
of Mrs. Lincoln, and Philip Moeller’s “ Pokey” is 
his notion of the romance of Captain John Smith and 
Pocahontas. Romain Rolland, who introduced his- 
toric figures of women in his plays of the French 
Revolution, “The Fourteenth of July” and “ Dan- 
ton” (Holt), has a thrilling drama, “The Monte- 
span” (Huebsch), based on the poison plot against 
the King. The American translation has a new in- 
troduction with Rolland’s ideas on historical drama; 
they permit him to put the Montespan to death 
years ahead of time and rather more to her credit.

“What little plays for children may be given without 
too much time or effort in production?” 
Tue plays of Constance D’Arcy Mackaye, “The 
House of the Heart,” “The Silver Thread,” and the 
others included in the volumes with these titles as 
well as episodes, arranged so they can be given as 
separate plays, from her “Patriotic Plays and 
Pageants” (Holt), are constantly given and with 
excellent effect. The Drama League sponsors an 
admirable series of little plays, two sets of them, 
one by Louise Ayres Garnett called “ Three to Make 
Ready,” and one, “Ten Minutes by the Clock” 
(Doran), by Alice C. D. Riley. Some have music. 
Some of the shorter plays in Constance Willcox’s 
“Told in a Chinese Garden” (Holt) are witty and 
picturesque. “A Treasury of Plays for Children” 
is edited by Montrose Moses (Little), and has the
-P-A-G-E-377
  
THE DRAMA 367 
largest collection of plays long and short suitable for 
production by young people that I have seen gathered 
in a single volume; it has also book-lists on produc- 
tion. Miles Malleson’s “Four One-Act Plays” 
(Swartwout) are sympathetic fantasies for children. 
Katherine Lord’s “The Little Play Book” (Duf- 
field) and “Plays for School and Camp” (Little) 
are for in or out of doors. ‘The Fairy Four Leaf,” 
by Carola Bell (Brentano), is a graceful outdoor play 
for girls. “Little Plays from American History,” 
by Alice J. Walker (Holt), are for children; for older 
ones are her “ Lafayette,’ ‘“‘Columbus” and “The 
Long Knives in Illinois,” in one volume (Holt). Grace 
Bird and Maud Starling have made a book of fifteen 
short “ Historical Plays for Children ” from Columbus 
to Lincoln (Macmillan). 
There are lists of plays for children in several 
of the books on production elsewhere listed, and 
bibliographies like “ Choosing a Play,” by Gertrude 
Johnson (Century), with suggestions for the director 
of amateur dramatics, will be helpful.

“1 am collecting plays, histories, songs, stories or any 
literary material having to do with the Harle- 
quinade and its characters, Pierrot, Pierette, 
Columbine and the rest. The collection will in- 
clude not only books on pantomime, but take in 
those on puppets.” 
“Tue History oF THE HaRLEQUINADE,” by Maurice 
Sand (Lippincott), is published in this country in two  
-P-A-G-E-378
  368 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
large volumes with many pictures. Granville 
Barker’s delicate fantasy, “The Harlequinade ” 
(Little), leads a child through the history of these 
stage people down the centuries. The student of the © 
commedia dell’ arte will find valuable side-lights on 
the transition period in “ Goldoni and the Venice of 
His Time,” by Joseph Spencer Kennard (Macmillan), 
and if you can come by the files of Gordon Craig’s 
magazine The Mask you will touch a treasury of 
woodcuts of characters and scenes. Kenneth Mac- 
gowan and Herman Rosse have a new book on 
“Masks and Demons” (Harcourt), a history of 
“false faces” from the masks of Greek tragedy to 
the disguises of Central African medicine men. 
The best bibliography of marionettes is to be found 
in the appendix to “The Heroes of the Puppet 
Stage,” by Madge Anderson (Harcourt), which is 
the latest and most comprehensive of a number of 
books coming out of the recent revival of interest 
in puppet performance. There are nine pages of 
titles of books and magazine articles. Before that 
came Helen Haiman Joseph’s “A Book of Marion- 
ettes ” (Huebsch), a large and beautifully illustrated 
volume showing their history and development. 
“The Tony Sarg Marionette Book,” by Josefa Metz, 
is lucid enough for parents and children. 
Out of the endless variety of plays involving panto- 
mime characters certain dramas come to the mind as 
in some fashion distinctive and continuing the tradi- 
tion: Edna St. Vincent Millay’s “Aria da Capo,” 
in which the frail figures of the mimes outlast the 
horror of war; “ Love Magic,” by Gregorio Martinez 
 
-P-A-G-E-379
THE DRAMA 369 
Sierra, an old-fashioned formula for reviving the 
affections, played in a formal garden; Benavente’s 
delicate profundity “The Bonds of Interest,” 
Evreinov’s “ Merry Death,” a brilliant and sinister 
piece of fantasy; Ernest Dowson’s “ Pierrot of the 
Minute” and Oliphant Dow’s “The Maker of 
Dreams”; Barker and Housman’s “ Prunello”; 
Colin Campbell Clements, two Columbine plays in 
“Plays for a Folding Theatre” (Stewart Kidd) ; 
the deathless “L’Enfant Prodigue,” known to us as 
“Pierrot the Prodigal.” Schnitzler’s “Gallant Cas- 
sian” was written for puppets, and the earlier plays 
of Maeterlinck for super-marionettes. The exquisite 
costumes in the stage version of ‘“ Scaramouche,” 
which were designed by T. S. Cleland, look like 
plates from old books on the commedia dell’ arte 
come to life and color. Of modern books with such 
plates, in color, I know of nothing in English to 
approach the picture-books “Narran le Maschere,” 
with pictures by Montedoro (Istituto Italiano d’Arti, 
Bergamo), and “ Batocchio e Cavicchio,” with pic- 
tures by Brunelleschi (Casa Editrice Italia, Corso). 
The stories are by G. Adami, and the color-plates 
are of the familiar characters in their most enticing 
embodiments.

BUILDING A LIBRARY 
“A clergyman in the Southwest, two hundred miles 
from a bookstore, and having to look too sharply to 
his expenses-account to order new books as freely 
as he would like, asks the Guide for advice in build-
-P-A-G-E-380
  370 A READER’S GUIDE BOOK 
ing a collection of thoroughly good books, whether 
new or old, for his enjoyment and enlightenment. 
“He must depend upon that almost entirely for a 
supply of good literature, for no public library is 
within reach.” 
My advice to those in situations like this — and it 
is advice that I am often called upon to give —is to 
provide one’s self at once with three small catalogues 
of books at a small, uniform price: ‘“ Everyman’s 
Library ” (Dutton), the “ Home University Library ” 
(Holt), and the little “World’s Classics” (Oxford 
Press). The delightful security that comes from 
ordering, unsight unseen, from these lists, is not be- 
cause you so often get a good book but because you 
never get a poor one—there are no blanks. And 
I do not mean by that a book that is “good for 
you” —I can think of nothing more depressing than 
to be shut up in a lonely parsonage entirely sur- 
rounded with improving literature. ‘ Everyman’s ” 
has jolly books and sad ones, and numbers of them 
are just to have a thoroughly good time with — but 
every one is a good book. You find in the catalogue 
the names of old favorites you had thought out of 
print, and to your surprise come upon names so new 
that you had believed them inaccessible save in ex- 
pensive editions. 
The second catalogue, that of the “ Home University 
Library,” is to be depended upon for concise, read- 
able and authoritative information upon any sub- 
ject included in its list of titles, and these range the 
departments of modern knowledge. I have never
-P-A-G-E-381
  THE DRAMA 371 
read a dull book among the lot, and I have had occa- 
sion to look into many of them, for many purposes; 
while you may come upon treasures like Gilbert 
Murray’s “Euripides and his Age” or Lytton 
Strachey’s “Landmarks in French Literature.” 
The “ World’s Classics” has not so many titles, 
but with the others will extend the range of world 
literature even beyond the far confines of Every- 
man’s. Another feature is that though all these col- 
lections are in pocket-sizes, this one is in vest-pocket 
size and yet, so clear is the type and so well are they 
printed, they are easily read, and so could be taken 
about with greater ease. 
Another feature, too, is the beauty of these vol- 
umes, taken collectively. What could give a more 
decorative quality to a room than the rich note of 
color struck by a long line of “ Everyman’s,” the 
deep green and gold of the little Oxford books? 
The “Home University” is small and solid; a line 
of them is dignified, without the deadly uniformity 
of the “set.” A few planks, a lick of paint, and 
lines of books — where now is your desert?

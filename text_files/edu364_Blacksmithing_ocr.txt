PREFACE 
P35 book is designed for use as a text in school shops and 
farm shops, and for the blacksmith who is interested in 
extending his knowledge and increasing his skill. It is one 
of a series of trade manuals developed on the plan set forth 
in the book How to Teach a Trade.* 
The material is organized in such a manner as to give the 
utmost flexibility in teaching the subject, and it makes 
possible individual instruction without increasing the burdens 
of the teacher. It also provides for the progress of the indi- 
vidual pupil according to his ability and application. 
It is obvious that the first step in teaching a trade is to 
determine exactly what you wish to teach. In order to 
determine this it is necessary to have a comprehensive 
analysis of the trade. Such an analysis is provided in this 
manual. It is based upon what one must be able to do in 
order to be proficient in the trade, and upon what one must 
know. 
What one must be able to do involves the operations, or 
the manipulative skills, of the trade. What one must know 
consists of the topics of information with which the worker 
must be familiar in order to plan his jobs and carry on his 
work successfully. , 
With this analysis as the basis, instructions are given tell- 
ing exactly how to perform the operations. This is a dis- 
tinctive feature of the book. The instructions are the result 
of a number of years of practical experience in a general 
blacksmith shop as well as a number of years of experience 
in teaching blacksmithing to many grades and types of boys. 
The material and methods have been thoroly tested in 
classes of farm boys and of engineering students. In every 
case the classes have made unusually rapid progress and have 
developed an increased confidence and self-reliance. The

simple language and abundant illustrations make the 
directions easily understood. 
Based upon the result of extended tests with boys and men 
of various grades of advancement, suggestions are given for 
the use of the manual. These methods have been highly suc- 
cessful but other practices or modifications of these might 
give equally good results. 
The instructions cover the operations involved in forging 
and welding iron and steel, hardening and tempering, general 
repair work, tire setting and horseshoeing. The directions 
tell, step by step, how to perform each operation. 
In dealing with the information topics the essential facts 
are stated briefly and without discussion. These are sepa- 
rated from the operations in order that they may be pre- 
sented when needed and without unduly interfering with the 
development of skill in the manipulative operations.

HOW TO USE THE MANUAL 
eS manual is not intended to dispense with instruction 
on the part of the teacher, but it does supply well organ- 
ized material of instruction in a permanent form available 
to the student at all times. In most instances these instruc- 
tions will be found adequate but no book can supply the 
inspiration that comes from the personal contact of teacher 
and pupil. Neither can written instructions supply an ideal 
with respect to workmanship, which is the first step in the 
development of skill. These fundamental things must come 
from some other source and some provision must be made 
for them. One important advantage of having the instruc- 
tion material organized in this form is that it gives the 
teacher more time and opportunity for individual contact, 
and he must not neglect this opportunity. The ideals with 
respect to what constitutes good workmanship must be sup- 
plied by demonstrations and by examples. 
When we analyze any job which we wish to use as the 
basis for instruction we find that there are one or more dis- 
tinct divisions, or points, we wish to emphasize. These 
divisions we call units of instruction and when they deal 
with manipulative operations we call them unit operations. 
These unit operations are selected as units of instruction 
because they occur in practically the same form as parts of 
a great many jobs. Since all jobs are made up of one or 
more of these operations in various combinations the plan 
has been to prepare definite instructions for performing each 
operation. The operations are divided into definite instruc- 
tional steps. These instructions are prepared with great care 
and accuracy and are, in a condensed form, just what the 
instructor would give orally. 
With such an arrangement we have definite written 
instructions for every operation, or instruction unit, in any 
job that may arise. All we have to do is analyze the job to 
7
-P-A-G-E-8
  
8 How To Use the Manual 
find out what operations are involved and we have the 
instructions for each operation organized and at hand. This 
gives an almost unlimited flexibility without increasing the 
burdens of the teacher. 
We do not give a list of jobs but every teacher should 
have such a list—a list much larger than he would expect any 
student to do. The instructor should analyze each of these 
jobs carefully and list the operations involved. Such an 
analysis enables him to determine more accurately the doing 
difficulty involved in the job and to determine whether the 
job involves the operations in which he wishes to give 
instruction. 
The first jobs should be very simple ones, and the teacher 
should never assign a job until he is sure it is within the 
capacity of the student; but when the job is once assigned, 
the student should be held to a strict performance of the 
task. 
It often is desirable to have a student go thru a certain 
amount of practice on these operations before he undertakes 
a project or job involving several operations; however, there 
is no objection to a student’s undertaking any job he is capable 
of handling in a satisfactory manner. 
The student should be required to analyze and plan his 
job before he begins work on it. It may help to think of the 
operations as the different objectives as one progresses with 
the job. 
In the task of the analysis of the job some individual 
assistance may be necessary, but care must be taken to 
develop self-reliance on the part of the student. It is well 
to remember that time is not wasted that is spent in pre- 
liminary study and planning of the job. The ability to look 
at a job and tell what operations are involved and determine 
the proper order of procedure in doing them is one in which 
students will take great pride. The development of the ability 
to analyze and plan a job is so important that it is well to 
give considerable time to it even when the jobs are not to 
be done by the students.
-P-A-G-E-9
  How To Use the Manual 9 
It should be remembered that the development of skill is 
one of the objects of this training and that skill is a thoroly 
established habit that can be developed only thru much prac- 
tice. A student should never be regarded as proficient in an 
operation until he can do it with speed and confidence. 
In order that the student may appreciate and understand 
the value of the printed instructions, it is well in the beginning 
to have some member of the class read the instructions for 
an operation while the instructor performs the operation, 
step by step as directed. Such demonstrations should be 
given frequently in order to give the student an ideal, with 
respect to skill, toward which to work. It is also well to have 
a student perform an operation before the class as another 
reads the instructions. This will establish confidence in the 
instructions and give the students a feeling that with the 
instructions they will be able to work out their jobs without 
assistance. 
There should always be many examples of good work- 
manship in the shop. There should be simple things, such as 
the beginner must do, as well as intricate ornamental work. 
This is necessary in order that the boy may know what 
constitutes good workmanship in the field of his immediate 
problem. 
Before a student begins a job he should read carefully all 
the directions for performing the operations with which he 
is not already familiar. He should have clearly in mind each 
step in performing the operations. It is by no means neces- 
sary that he have his book open before him, but he should 
have it at hand for reference if any difficulty arises. The 
class should be called together frequently for the discussion 
of the questions given in connection with the instructions, 
matters of information, and the consideration of any diffi- 
culties that may have arisen and means of overcoming 
them. 
If we lay aside our old pedagogical formalism and examine 
the problem of shop teaching as it actually exists we will find 
that there are several distinct phases of instruction. This is  
-P-A-G-E-10
  10 How To Use the Manual 
true whether the instruction is given in written or in oral 
form. 
1. There must be a clear and definite statement of the 
problem or job so that the learner will know exactly what 
is required. 
This means that all drawings, specifications or instructions 
necessary for the completion of the job should be given to 
the student. He should also have a definite notion of the 
standard of workmanship required. 
In order that the instructor may be sure that every detail 
of the instructions are understood the student should explain 
’ the instructions to the instructor. More failures result from 
a want of a thoro understanding of what is required than 
from all other causes combined. Be absolutely sure that every 
detail of the requirement is understood. 
2. The student should analyze the job for the operations 
involved. 
In order that the student may do this readily at the 
beginning he should be given a list of the Unit Operations 
of the trade and on this he should check the operations 
involved in the particular job. This is a further verification 
of step one and assures the teacher that the student knows 
- what is to be done. A few well-directed questions will lead 
the student to discover any errors in his analysis. He should 
also enter on the sheet his estimate of the time required for 
the job and at the completion of the job the actual time 
required should be entered. 
3. The student should list the operations in the order in 
which they should be performed. 
Different orders of procedure often are equally good. The 
pupil should be questioned as to his method and if he can 
give a good reason for it he should be permitted to follow 
his plan, altho it may not be the usual order. 
The teacher should never neglect this analysis and 
planning of the job. It is a matter of thought and reasoning
-P-A-G-E-11
  
How To Use the Manual 11 
and represents the highest type of development. The ability 
to do it is the thing that marks the distinction between the 
capable, self-reliant, high-grade mechanic and the low-grade 
journeyman who can do only the things he is told to do. It 
is quite different from acquiring information or developing 
manipulative skill, and to neglect it is to neglect one of the 
most important phases of the pupil’s training. 
4. The instructor should give all necessary information and 
directions and, when necessary, give a demonstration of 
any new process involved. 
The manual gives very definite directions for performing 
the operations. The pupil should be required to read these 
directions very carefully before starting on his task and have 
them at hand for ready reference during the progress of the 
job. After a pupil has performed an operation a few times 
he will know how to do it and it will not be necessary for 
him to read the instructions unless he meets with some dif- 
ficulty. He will need practice, in order to acquire skill, long 
after he has learned how to perform the operations and no 
longer needs the instructions. 
The teacher should demonstrate any difficult manipulative 
operation not made perfectly clear by the printed instruc- 
tions. The most effective way of doing this is to have the 
pupil read the instructions or directions while the teacher 
performs the operation step by step as directed. This helps 
the pupil to realize the real value of the printed instructions. 
The teacher should be sure that the pupil is familiar with 
the topics of information that may affect the success of the 
work. 
5. The work should be done according to plan. 
Having a definite and clearly understood plan with com- 
plete directions, the pupil should proceed with speed and 
decision to the doing of the job. Loitering, indecision, or care- 
less and slovenly habits should never be permitted. The 
teacher should observe the work carefully and render assist-   
 
-P-A-G-E-12
  12 How To Use the Manual 
ance only where it is actually needed. The necessary mate- 
rial having been placed in the hands of the pupil, he should 
solve his problem unaided unless there is danger of his fall- 
ing into bad habits. 
6. The teacher should check results. 
The teacher should observe the work carefully in order 
to determine the effectiveness of the instruction and whether 
additional practice is necessary in order to attain the desired 
skill. This gives an opportunity to talk with the pupil con- 
cerning the virtues or defects of his plan. 
7. Students should report on the job when completed. 
It is well to have students report to the group when the 
job is finished. The report should cover the following items: 
a) Time required to do the job. 
b) Material used on the job. 
ce) Any special difficulties encountered and how they were 
overcome. 
d) Whether some other plan of procedure might have been 
better. 
Such a report develops pride and a laudable ambition to 
excel in the matter of speed and workmanship. Also, some 
very valuable and helpful suggestions will be brought out in 
the discussion. 
Every teacher of experience knows how difficult it is to 
get pupils to do the necessary preliminary study and planning 
of a job, and every teacher knows, also, that the failure to 
do this is one of the chief sources of unsatisfactory work. 
Planning a job requires careful, systematic thought and rea- 
soning and most pupils prefer the more spectacular work of 
handling tools and materials. They are in a hurry to get 
at what to them is the real, creative work. It is difficult for 
them to realize that careful planning will mean a saving in 
time, energy and material. The teacher should invariably 
insist upon this conscious, definite planning until the habit 
is thoroly established. Such a habit will be an invaluable 
possession.

BUILDING AND MAINTAINING FORGE FIRE 
Directions: 
1. Clean the fire pot around the tuyere of all dirt and 
cinder. Turn on the blast to blow small pieces out of the 
corners. 
2. See that the tuyere fits tightly against the bottom of 
the fire pot. 
3. Light a small amount of oily waste or a handful of 
shavings on the bottom, place it over the tuyere and cover 
this completely but lightly with small lumps of coke. 
  Fic. 1. Cross-section of forge and fire. H, hearth; 
F, fire pot; T, tuyere; B, blast; A, ash dump. 
4. Apply a small amount of blast until the coke is con- 
verted into a live bed of coals. 
5. Bank the fire on three sides with wet, green coal; leav- 
ing the side next to you open. Fig. 1. 
6. The size of the pieces to be heated will determine the 
size of the fire used. Use a fire that will heat only that portion 
of the stock that is to be worked. For large work build up 
the fire until there is a heavy layer of coals covering the parts 
to be heated. 
7. If a small fire is wanted and it tends to get too big, 
add wet coal on sides. If there is already sufficient fuel, pour 
water on the coke surrounding the fire.

8. When the fire becomes hollow, punch in coke from the 
sides. 
9. After the fire has been used for a while, slag and cinder 
will form in the bottom over the tuyere. Remove this by 
pushing out the slag and cinder and build up the fire as 
before.

jaws to be parallel when clamped on the work. 
ee Fic. 2. Too narrow. 
= Fic. 3. Too wide. 
Se Fic. 4. Correct. 
2. If flat-jawed tongs fail to hold round work firmly, use 
bolt tongs. 
3. If the jaws of the tongs when clamped are approxi- 
mately parallel with the edges of the work but still the work 
is not held firmly, heat the tongs to a red heat and bend the 
jaws until they touch the stock along their entire length and 
hold it firmly. 
4. If two pieces of stock are to be held in the same position 
with reference to each other, grasp the stock with the tongs, 
slip the link over the handles and force toward the jaws until 
the work is clamped firmly. 
5. Keep the tongs cold by dipping them frequently in a 
slack tub. 
6. Figs. 3, 4, 5, and 6 show common types of tongs. For 
special types of work use tongs designed for that particular 
kind of job. Figs. 7, 8, 9, and 10.

HEATING WORK 
Directions: 
1. Place the part of the stock to be heated in nearly a hori- 
zontal position in the center of the fire and arrange the coals 
with the poker until the part is surrounded with a bed of live 
coals. Be careful to prevent the blast from coming directly 
in contact with the stock. When the fire becomes hollow, 
punch in the sides with the poker. 
2. Use just enough blast to keep the fire burning well, and 
avoid too large a fire. 
3. After the stock has been in the fire a short time, remove 
it to see how the heat is progressing. 
4. If the heat is being taken on two pieces at the same 
time, as in the case of welding, and it is found that one piece is 
heating faster than the other, remove from the fire the piece 
that is heating too fast and allow the other to catch up. 
5. If a piece of stock is being heated that cannot be turned 
over in the fire, turn off the blast for a short time at intervals 
and allow the heat to soak thru until the temperature on both 
sides is uniform. 
6. If large pieces are being worked, heat slowly so the 
stock will have a uniform temperature all the way thru.

Questions: 
1. Why keep the stock in nearly a horizontal position in the fire while 
heating? 
2. Why does the stock heat more quickly in a compact fire than it does 
in a hollow one? 
3. What is the effect of using too much blast? 
4, What is the effect on the stock of being heated in a hollow fire? 
5. What is the effect of having the blast come in direct contact with 
the stock while heating? 
6. How can one prevent the draft from coming in direct contact with 
the stock?

MEASURING AND CUTTING STOCK 
Directions: 
1. Measure off on the bar the required length and mark 
with chalk at the point to be cut. If the stock is to be heated 
for cutting, mark also with a center punch or cold chisel, 
so the mark will not be lost when heated. 
2. For curves and irregular shapes the experienced smith 
usually relies upon his judgment as to the amount of stock 
required unless a rather high degree of accuracy is necessary, 
but this is not a safe plan for beginners. In order to develop 
this ability, however, it is well to make an estimate of the 
stock required, mark lightly with chalk, and then check this 
measurement by actual measurement. 
  Fic. 11. The dotted line is the measur- Fig. 12 
ing line. 
3. In bending stock, the outside of the stock on the curve 
stretches and the inside part is compressed. There is a neu- 
tral line at the center that is neither stretched nor compressed. 
The proper length of stock for any bent shape may be found 
by measuring this center line of the curve or bend. Probably 
the best way to measure this line is to take a small wire that 
will bend readily and keep its shape, and lay it on the central 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
  
Operation No. 4 19 
Page No. 2 
line. Then straighten the wire and measure it. If a weld 
is to be made, allowance must be made for upsetting. 
Fig. 11. 
4. The length required for rings or bands may be caleu- 
lated by taking three times the inside diameter plus four times 
the thickness of the stock, or by taking three and one-seventh 
times the diameter of the center line plus one-half the diameter 
of the stock. Fig. 12. 
5. Cut wrought-iron and soft steel under 34” in diameter 
by placing it on the hardy and striking with the hammer 
directly over the cutting edge. When the cut is two-thirds 
thru, bend back and forth until it breaks off. If the cut is to 
be finished on the hardy, strike on the far side of the cutting 
edge when it is nearly finished. Fig. 13. 
= 
Fig. 13 Fia. 14 
6. If tool steel, or wrought-iron over 34” in diameter, is 
to be cut, place the stock on the edge of the anvil where the 
cut is to be made and set the cutter on the top of the stock 
exactly even with the cutting edge of the hardy and strike 
with the sledge until the stock may be easily broken. Fig. 14.
-P-A-G-E-20
  20 Operation No. 4 
Page No. 3 
7. Always heat the tool steel to a low red before attempt- 
ing to cut it. Heavy stock may be more readily cut when 
heated. 
8. If the cut is to be made in flat stock or for a consider- 
able length in sheet stock, lay the portion where the cut is 
to be made flat on the anvil and make the cut two-thirds of 
the way thru the stock. Place the nearly finished cut so that 
it lies along the edge of the anvil. Place the cutter on the far 
end of the cut with the handle elevated to about forty-five 
degrees, the lower corner of the cutter extending beyond the 
stock and resting against the side of the anvil, thus forming 
a shear. Cut along the edge of the anvil until the cut is

DRAWING OUT STOCK 
Directions: 
1. Heat the stock to a bright red and place it on the anvil 
so that the hammer blows will fall near the center of the anvil 
face. Deliver blows so that the face of the hammer will fall 
approximately parallel to the face of the anvil. Between 
blows turn the stock so that the blows fall alternately on the 
sides and the top, keeping the work square in section. 
2. If the stock tends to become diamond shaped, tilt it on 
the long diagonal and deliver drawing blows so that the stock 
is drawn back square in section. If the stock is sufficiently 
large, place it in the corner between the chipping block and the 
face of the anvil while delivering drawing blows as above 
directed. Fig 16. 
N\ 
Fic. 16 
3. If the stock is to be drawn to a point, raise the handles 
of the tongs and draw the stock to a blunt point, keeping the 
point of the stock even with the far edge of the anvil. To 
finish the taper, lower the tong handles and deliver blows so 
that the face of the hammer will form the angle of the taper 
desired with the face of the anvil. If the stock is to be drawn 
to a round taper draw it to a square taper first, then octagon 
and finally round. Fig. 17. 
4. To do rapid drawing, heat the stock and place it across 
the horn of the anvil and strike heavy blows with the hammer 
so the horn will form a series of notches on the stock. Smooth

BENDING ROUND AND RECTANGULAR STOCK 
Directions: y 
1. Heat uniformly the stock to be bent. If a curve or com- 
plete circle is to be made, extend the end of the heated stock 
over the horn of the anvil and deliver glancing blows beyond 
the horn, so that the curve is started exactly at the end of the 
stock. As the stock cools it bends with difficulty and should be 
reheated. 
2. If the stock becomes curved too much, place one end of 
the curve on the horn and curve up. Hold the other end in 
the tongs and deliver glancing blows on top of the curve 
between the tongs and the horn. 
Fic. 19 
3. If a right angle bend is to be formed having both the 
inside and outside corners sharp, then the stock must be upset 
thru the portion that is to form the bend to about one and 
one-half times its original thickness. Make the bend over the 
sharp edge of the face of the anvil and use drawing blows to 
pull excess stock out into the outside corner. Fig. 19. 
4. When bending flat stock edgewise and the inside cir- 
cumference tends to buckle, the stock must be placed on the 
anvil face and hammered flat frequently. 
5. If thin, flat stock cannot be bent by the above method 
and uniform thickness is not essential, hammer on the outside 
edge of the stock until the proper curve is formed. 
6. Make a slight curve in thin stock by peening the outside 
edge. 
7. Straighten thin stock by peening inside edge.

BENDING EYES 
Directions: 
1. Measure off and mark with a center punch the amount 
of stock required to form the eye. Heat to a bright red and 
bend the stock to a sharp right angle at the point marked. 
2. Extend the end of the stock that is to form the eye over 
the tip of the anvil horn and bend it until it is approximately 
the curvature of the finished eye. Fig. 20. 
Fic. 20 
8. As the proper curve is formed, keep slipping the stock 
over the horn, striking glancing blows until all the stock back 
to a right-angle bend has been formed into a circle. 
4. If the eye is not circular, slip it over the horn as far as 
it will go and strike lightly until it is perfectly round. Fig. 21. 
5. Grasp the eye in the tongs and lay the shank on the 
anvil face, with the opening of the eye up and the eye pressed 
closely against the corner of the anvil. In this position, ham- 
mer until the shank is perfectly straight. This tends to reduce 
curvature at the right-angle bend. 
6. If the eye is not central with respect to the shank, either 
put in or take out the curve where the first right-angle bend 
was formed. 
7. To put in the curve, hook the eye over the tip of the 
horn with the opening down, holding the shank in the tongs;

TWISTING 
Directions: 
1. Mark with a center punch the ends of the part of the 
stock to be twisted. Heat to a uniformly bright red. 
2. If the length of the twist is more than two inches and 
the stock is under a half inch square, clamp the stock firmly 
with two pairs of close-fitting tongs, the edges of the jaws 
even with the center punch marks, and the part to be twisted 
between the tongs. Rotate until the required twist is made, 
being careful to keep the stock in line. 
3. If the stock is heavy or if the length to be twisted is 
more than two inches, clamp the stock in the vise at one end of 
the part to be twisted. Clamp with a monkey wrench at the 
other end of the twist and rotate the wrench until the required 
twist is made, being careful to keep the stock in line. 
4. Cool the part twisting too fast by pouring on a small 
stream of water from an oil-can or cup, and continue twisting. 
5. When the stock is uniformly twisted straighten with 
a wooden mallet on a block of wood.

Directions: 
1. Heat the part that is to be upset to a white heat and 
place it on anvil, hot end down. Deliver heavy blows on the 
cold end, being careful to keep the stock at right angles to 
the face of anvil. When the stock bends, straighten it immedi- 
ately. Correct any irregularity by placing it flat on the 
face of the anvil and hammering until the upset portion is 
symmetrical. d

2. If the stock tends to upset in other than the one desired 
place, cool the parts that should not be upset. 
3. If large, long pieces of stock are to be upset, heat to 
white heat the part to be upset and ram against the face or 
side of the anvil or floor plate.

HEADING 
Directions: 
1. Upset the stock sufficiently for a head of the required 
size. This usually will require that the stock be upset until 
it is shortened by about three times the thickness of the head. 
2. Heat upset stock to nearly a white heat, and place it in 
a heading tool slightly larger than the diameter of the original 
stock. Fig. 25.

3. Extend the shank thru the hardy-hole in the face of the 
anvil and deliver heavy blows on top of the stock, extending 
above the face of heading tool, being careful to form the head 
as nearly on the center of the shank as possible. 
4. Hammer until the head is about one and one-half times 
the thickness that it is to be when finished, then remove it 
from the heading tool by turning it upside down on the face 
of the anvil, and lifting the heading tool off, leaving the bolt 
standing on the face of the anvil, head down. 
5. Grasp the shank of the bolt with the tongs, and hold it 
on the anvil with the shank parallel to the face of the anvil. 
Hammer on the sides of the bolt head until they are approxi- 
mately parallel with the edges of the shank.
-P-A-G-E-31
  Operation No. 10 31 
Page No. 2 
6. Place the bolt on the anvil again, head down, and 
examine it to determine whether or not the head is on the 
center. 
7. If the shank is found to be nearer one side of the head 
than the other, proceed as follows: Reheat it to a bright 
red, place it in the heading tool with the narrow edge of the 
head to the right, extend the shank thru the hardy-hole and 
deliver a heavy drawing blow on the left or wide edge, of the 
head, with the hammer face forming an approximate forty- 
five degree angle with the face of the anvil. Continue to 
deliver drawing blows, meanwhile lowering the hammer 
handle until the face of the hammer and the face of the anvil 
are approximately parallel, and the head is exactly on the 
center. 
Caution: Never continue to hammer the head until it 
becomes thinner than it is to be when finished. 
8. Hammer alternately on the sides of the head and top 
until the edges are parallel to the shank. Continue until the 
corners of the head come out perfectly sharp and the head is 
perfectly round and of a uniform thickness; then square the 
head. 
9. To form a square head, continue to hammer alternately 
on the sides and top until the head is uniformly square, uni- 
formly thick, and the corners come out perfectly sharp and 
of the required width and thickness. 
10. Finish the top of the head by placing a buttonhead set, 
Fig. 26, on the top and hammering until the arch is formed 
on all sides from corner to corner. Hammer the edges until 
they are again parallel to the shank. 
11. If a hexagon head is to be formed, the operations are 
exactly the same, except that, in treating the stock after it is 
perfectly round, it is turned thru sixty instead of ninety 
degrees while being forged.

WELDING 
Directions: 
1. Clean the fire of all cinder and slag that may be col- 
lected over the tuyere. Have a good supply of coke so that 
the fire may be replenished without using green coal. Large 
work requires a deep fire and a large bed of coals and if such 
work is being done, construct the fire accordingly. 
2. Clean the face of the anvil of all scale, place the ham- 
mer in a position so that the handle may be easily grasped, 
and place the anvil in a convenient position with reference 
to the forge so that the weld may be completed without delay 
after the heat is taken. 
3. Place the work to be welded in the fire in an approxi- 
mately horizontal position with a live bed of coals between 
the work and the tuyere and the part to be welded directly 
over the tuyere. 
4. Cover the work with a bed of live coals and start the 
blast. Take the heat slowly. Turn the stock over occasionally 
while the heat is being taken. This is especially important 
on large work. If one part heats faster than the other, turn 
off the blast and let the stock soak until it is of a uniform 
temperature thruout. 
5. Pull the stock out occasionally or uncover it with a poker 
to see how the heat is progressing. When the stock is a 
bright red, sprinkle a small amount of flux on the scarf. After 
this is done replace it in the fire quickly and recover it so 
that the stock will not be exposed to air any longer than 
necessary. 
6. Continue to heat the stock until the dry, scaly appear- 
ance caused by the oxidation of the metal becomes molten 
looking and fluid iron is actually flowing on the surface. As 
soon as this condition exists remove it from the fire, strike the 
work on the anvil, place the scarfs together and hammer, first

with very light blows, then with heavier ones, until the pieces 
are firmly united. 
7. Do not attempt to stick the pieces together by hammer- 
> Fic. 38 
ing after they have cooled below the welding heat. 
8. If the pieces fail to stick at the first heat, cut off the 
tips and resurface the scarfs before trying again. 
Fic. 39 
9. Make welds with as few heats as possible as the diffi- 
culty of getting iron or steel to stick increases with the num- 
ber of heats. Figs. 38 and 39. 
Lap Weld. 
10. If an ordinary lap weld is to be made, as in the case 
of a flat ring, heat and upset the ends of the stock thruout 
the length that will become red hot during the process of 
welding until it is one and one-half times its original diameter 
or thickness. Place the stock flat on the face of the anvil and 
with the edge of the face of the hammer scarf or bevel the end 
of the stock until it forms a 45 degree angle. Deliver blows 
so that the center of the scarf will be somewhat rounded 
instead of hollow. Next, place it on edge and draw the bevel

to a blunt oval-shaped point, being careful that the length 
of the completed scarf is not more than one and one-half 
times the diameter or thickness of the original stock. Ham- 
mer down the edges so that the surface of the scarf remains 
rounded and roughen the surface with the edge of the face 
of the hammer or with the peen. Scarf the other end on the 
opposite side in the same manner. Bend the stock into the 
desired shape and lap the ends until the tip of one scarf lies on 
the heel of the other. Hammer the lap until the scarfs fit 
snugly together, flux and take the heat. When heated to a 
welding heat remove it from the fire, place it flat on the anvil, 
and deliver a blow on the lap. Turn the stock over quickly 
and deliver a blow on the other side. Continue to hammer 
alternately on each side until the weld is completed. 
11. When separate pieces are 
to be welded, place both pieces 
in the fire, scarf up. Cover the 
ends over with live coals and 
turn on the blast. Remove the 
pieces frequently to see that 
both are at the same tempera- 
ture. If one is hotter than the other, remove the hottest one 
until the other catches up. When the stock begins to look 
molten turn it over quickly, scarf down. Leave it in this 
position, turn off the blast and allow the stock to soak for 
a few seconds. Remove both pieces at the same time, the 
shorter piece with the right hand, strike on the edge of the 
anvil to knock off the seale, and lay the end of the piece held 
in the right hand near the center of the anvil, scarf up and 
pointing toward you. Rest the other piece on the edge of 
the anvil with enough stock extending above the face of the 
anvil, so that when it is lowered the point of one scarf will 
come even with the heel of the other. Fig. 40. Lower the 
piece until the surfaces are in contact. Drop the tongs held 
in the right hand, grasp the hammer and deliver very light 
blows followed by heavy blows until the pieces are firmly 
united. Hammer on all the sides of the weld while the stock Fia. 40

Page No. 4 
is at a welding heat, so that the over-lapping edges will be 
welded down. 
Faggot Weld. 
12. If a faggot weld is being made, lay the pieces together 
so that the edges are even and grasp in the tongs that are 
wide enough in the throat to hold the stock firmly. Slip the 
link over the handles of the tongs so that the pressure will 
be constant on the stock. Place as much of the stock in the 
fire as can be conveniently heated at one time and cover it 
with live coals, being careful that there is a live bed of coals 
under the stock as well as over it. Raise the heat slowly by 
using a little blast first. When the stock is at a red heat, 
sprinkle a small amount of flux on the surfaces to be stuck 
together. Place the pieces together again and replace in the 
fire and raise to a welding heat, meanwhile turning the stock 
over and over to insure a uniform heat. When the stock is 
to a white heat and becomes molten-looking on all sides, re- 
move it from the fire, place it flat on the anvil and deliver 
heavy, overlapping blows thruout the length that is to a 
welding heat. If the edges of one piece project over the 
edges of another piece, hammer the weld on the edge while the 
stock is still at a welding heat. Continue to take overlapping, 
welding heats thruout the length of the stock until the pieces 
are one solid mass. 
Butt Weld. 
13. If a butt weld is to be made, heat and upset the stock 
on the ends thruout the length that will become red during 
the process of welding and until they are about one and one- 
half times their original diameter. Hammer the surfaces until 
they are round or convex, Fig. 41, with the center consider- 
ably higher than the edges. While at a red heat sprinkle a 
small amount of flux on the ends and place the stock in the 
fire, on a thick bed of live coals. Cover the ends with live 
coals and raise the temperature slowly, meanwhile turning the 
pieces of stock. Remove the stock occasionally to see if the 
ends are of uniform temperature. When the stock becomes

Page No. 5 
molten on the surfaces have the helper remove one piece of 
the stock from the fire, strike it on the anvil to knock off 
the slag, and place it flat on the anvil so that the end is 
about even with the center of the anvil. While the helper is 
doing this, remove the other piece from the fire, strike it on 
the anvil and place it end to end with the piece held by the 
a 
eel Fic. 41 
helper. Caution should be given to the helper to hold the 
stock firmly. Deliver blows on the end of the piece you are 
holding until the pieces are firmly united, and the crack 
between the ends is about closed. Then deliver blows on the 
top of the weld until it is perfectly smooth. Draw or swage 
it down to original dimensions. 
Split or Cleft Weld. 
14. If a split or cleft weld is to be made, heat and upset 
the stock as far as it will become red, during the process of 
welding and until each piece is about one and one-half times 
its original diameter. Clamp one piece of stock firmly in 
the vise and split the end for a distance equal to the original 
diameter of the stock. Spread the ends until they form a Y 
and draw the sides of the Y until they are blunt edged and 
form an oval shaped point. Make a blunt taper on the ends 
of the other piece, forming a 60 degree angle between the sur- 
faces of the taper. Figs. 42 and 43. 
Roughen the surfaces of the taper with a chisel or the 
edge of the hammer. Heat to a red heat and sprinkle flux on 
the ends and drive the taper into a Y and bend the ends of 
the Y down over the bulge on the taper piece to prevent the 
pieces from coming apart. Build up the fire so that the stock 
 
-P-A-G-E-47

Page No. 6 
will lie on a live bed of coals with no strain on the parts 
to be welded. Place the stock in the fire and take the heat 
slowly, meanwhile turning it over and over, so that the larger 
portions will become heated as fast as the tips of the Y. 
Fig. 42 
Fic. 43. Split weld for thin stock. 
Turn off the blast occasionally to allow the pieces to 
assume a uniform temperature thruout. When all is at uni- 
form welding heat, remove the work from the fire, having the 
helper support one end to keep it in line, and place it flat 
on the anvil. While the helper is holding one end of the stock, 
deliver one blow on the other end of the piece to drive the 
wedge firmly into the Y; then with light blows weld down 
the ends of the Y over the bulge. Next, deliver blows around 
the weld until the pieces are firmly united. In case of welding 
tool steel or mild steel, as in pointing tools, it is sometimes 
advisable to heat the pieces separately because of the different 
welding temperatures of the two materials. 
Chain Links. 
15. If chain links are being welded, bend the pieces of 
stock into U-forms. Heat the ends of the sides of the U to 
a bright red heat and place it on the sharp edge of the anvil 
just above the chipping block, with the outside of the edge 
of the left side of the U coming exactly even with the sharp 
edge of the anvil, and the sides of the U forming a 45 degree 
angle with the horn; the other side of the U extending over 
the face of the anvil. Fig. 44. In this position strike a flat 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  48 Operation No. 16 
Page No.7 
blow on the part resting on the edge of the anvil. Continue 
to strike blows, meanwhile moving the handles of the tongs 
toward you until the side of the U is parallel with the edge 
and slips off. Turn the stock over and repeat the operations 
on the other end of the U. Heat and bend the ends together 
until the link is somewhat pointed, the thick outside corner 
coinciding and the inside corners resting near the middle of 
the width of the opposite scarf. Grasp the opposite end of 
the link and place in the fire. Keep 
turning the link from side to side so 
that the heat will be uniform. When 
the stock be- 
comes molten- 
looking, re- 
move it from 
the fire, place 
Fic. 44 it flat on the Fic. 45 
anvil and deliver light blows. Turn the link over quickly and 
deliver a blow on the other side. Then place it over the tip 
of the horn and hammer on the corners until the stock is round 
in cross-section thru the weld. Figs. 46 and 47. 
T-Weld. 
16. Heat to a bright red heat the top of the T where the 
leg of the T is to be welded on, and upset it until it is about 
one and one-half times its original thickness; and if it is 
flat stock, until it is slightly wider also. Heat the leg of the 
T on the end and upset a similar amount. 
17. In the case of flat stock, place the bar of the T flat 
on the anvil and with the peen of a ball-peen hammer scarf 
it by forming a 45 degree taper on one side, as wide as the 
leg of the T and at the place where the upsetting was done. 
Fig. 46. Draw with the peen until the point of the scarf 
extends slightly past the edge of the stock and forms an egg- 
shaped point. 
18. Place the leg of the T flat on the anvil and scarf the 
upset end to a 45 degree angle, turn it on edge, raise the cold

end, and hammer the scarf to an oval-shaped point. Place 
the back flat on the anvil and hammer it with the corner of 
the hammer until the scarfed surface is slightly convex, being 
careful to prevent the entire length of the scarf from exceed- 
ing one and one-half times the original thickness. 
19. Place the pieces in a clean fire with the scarf up, and 
slowly raise the heat to a bright red. Remove, flux, replace 
it in the fire, and raise to a welding heat. Before removing the 
weld from the fire, turn the pieces over so that the scarf is 
down for a few seconds; then turn the blast off. Wait for a 
few seconds, remove the stock from the fire, strike on the 
anvil and place the bar of the T lengthwise of the anvil, scarf

up. Rest the leg of the T on the edge of the anvil and the 
lower end onto the bar. Strike very light blows at first, then 
heavy, and continue until the pieces are firmly united. Place 
the weld over the edge of the anvil occasionally to true the 
corners between the leg and the bar. 
20. If a T-weld is to be made in round stock upset the 
pieces as in the case of flat stock. Prepare the scarf on the 
bar of the T with the peen of the hammer, fuller, or bob 
punch. Scarf the end of the leg of the T to fit the scarf on the 
bar, Fig. 47. Proceed to weld as in the case of flat stock. 
Use a top fuller to weld down corners and projections. Fin- 
ish with swage blocks. A T-weld in round stock may be made 
also by splitting the end of the stem of the T and proceeding 
the same way as in a cleft weld.

21. Heat the end of the stock to a bright red heat and form 
a rectangular taper, the length of which is about twice the 
thickness of the stock. Hammer the end of this taper to a

24. In this position put approximately a right angle bend 
in the stock by striking the stock just beyond the point where 
it rests on the anvil. 
25. Place the stock near the tip of the horn so that the 
taper extends just past the horn and is inclined upward. 
With the work in this position strike glancing blows just 
beyond the horn and push the work forward as it is. bent 
until all of the stock that was bent to a right angle is formed

heat, meanwhile turning the stock over and over. 
28. When it is molten looking, remove it from the fire 
and quickly place it on the anvil with the eye extending on 
the far side and resting even with the edge. Turn the stock

FORGING TOOL STEEL 
Directions: 
1. Build a large clean fire and bank the sides and back 
with damp coal. 
2. Place the part of the tool steel that is to be forged in 
the fire on the bed of coals and cover it with live coals. 
3. Turn on a very small amount of blast and raise the heat 
slowly. 
4. If a large piece is being heated, build a large fire and 
heat the piece very slowly so that the center will reach the 
forging heat as soon as the outside. When working tool steel 
it is very important that it be of uniform temperature all the 
way thru. 
5. Never allow steel to soak in the fire with the blast 
turned off. “ 
6. When the steel reaches a red heat remove it from the 
fire and forge rapidly to the desired shape. 
7. Reheat as often as necessary to keep the steel at a red 
heat but finish the forging processes with a minimum num- 
ber of heats. 
8. Do not heat tool steel above a bright red heat.

ANNEALING TOOL STEEL 
Directions: 
1. Build a large clean fire—one that is big enough to cover 
completely the work to be annealed. 
2. Place the work to be annealed in the fire on a live bed 
of coals and cover it to exclude the air of the blast and the 
room from the steel. 
3. Heat very slowly by using only a very small amount of 
blast until the entire piece is up to a uniform red heat. 
4. Remove it from the fire and quickly place it in a box 
filled with air-slacked lime or pulverized charcoal. Cover it 
with a heavy layer and allow to remain until cold. 
5. If an annealing box is not available and work doesn’t 
require a high degree of accuracy in annealing, heat to a uni- 
form red heat and pack warm dry ashes around the piece on 
the side of the forge. Leave it until it is entirely cold.

HARDENING TOOL STEEL 
Directions: 
1. Heat the parts of the work to be hardened in a heavy, 
clean, non-oxidizing fire to a uniform cherry-red heat known 
as the ‘‘critical temperature.’’ 
2. Remove it from the fire and very quickly plunge it into 
a cooling bath such as cold water, brine, or oil. 
3. As the work is cooling keep shifting it in the bath to 
keep it always surrounded by cool liquid and to prevent the 
formation of steam pockets on the stock. 
4, If many pieces are to be hardened keep the bath cool 
by adding to it from time to time.

TEMPERING TOOL STEEL 
Directions: 
1. If only a portion of the tool is to be tempered as in the 
ease of a cold chisel, punch, or hammer face, do the hardening 
and tempering at the same heat. 
2. Heat the end of the tool to a cherry-red heat and plunge 
perpendicularly about an inch of the end in the cooling bath. 
While the tool is cooling keep moving it around so that it 
will be surrounded with a cold bath all the time, and up and 
down thru a short distance to prevent a water crack forming. 
When the part of the tool in the cooling bath is entirely cold 
remove it from the bath and polish the hardened surface with 
an emery cloth to remove all scale. 
8. Notice that the heat from the unscaled portion is con- 
ducting down toward the end very quickly and that a band of 
color, straw color, is on one side and blending into blue on 
the other side, and is forming on the grey hardened surface. 
Notice that this band of colors is moving toward the end of 
the stock. 
4. Hach of the colors in the band represents a different de- 
gree of hardness. When the color representing the required 
degree of hardness for the tool reaches the end plunge the 
tool until cold. For ordinary cold chisels, for general pur- 
poses, cool when the purple reaches the end. For punches and 
hammer faces, cool when the blue reaches the end. 
5. If the tool is to be tempered thruout its length harden 
and polish the entire tool, then hold the hardened polished tool 
over the forge fire, bunsen burner, blow torch, or heated piece 
of iron until the desired color appears. <A piece of heated pipe 
is excellent for small tools. Apply heat all over the hardened 
surface equally, as it is highly important to have the entire 
hardened surface change color at the same time. When the 
desired color appears, plunge the tool quickly until it is 
cold,

      6. If the tool breaks or chips when used for the purpose 
for which it was intended it indicates that it is too hard. Heat 
the tool very slowly and carefully until it changes to a color 
representing a slightly lower degree of hardness. For in- 
stance, if the tool was cooled when it had a uniform brownish 
purple color and it chipped or broke under use, it should be 
heated until the brownish purple color changes to a purple, 
then cooled.

7. If the tool bends when used for the purpose for which 
it was intended it indicates that it is too soft. Heat it to a 
cherry-red heat or critical temperature and plunge to harden. 
Polish the surface and heat very slowly until the color appears 
that represents a higher degree of hardness than that at which 
it was cooled the first time. For instance, if the tool was 
cooled when the hardened surface had turned to a purple color 
and it was found that it bent under use, reharden, polish the 
surface, and heat slowly until the hardened surface changes 
to a brownish purple color, then cool. 
8. In all cases of tempering, test the tool as soon as it is 
finished.

hardening what will happen if the tool has been cooled too much? If not 
cooled enough?

the steel to a high yellow color and quickly forge roughly to 
shape, at the first heat if possible. 
2. Rough-grind it to size and shape the cutting edge. 
3. Heat it in a deep, clean, well coked fire until the steel 
has a white greasy appearance and then plunge it in fish oil 
and let it remain until it is cold. If no oil is available let it 
cool in the air. Never plunge high-speed steel in water.

CASE-HARDENING 
Directions: 
1. For case-hardening work such as wrenches, wrist-pins, 
etc., use cast-iron box large enough to hold the work. Place a 
fire brick on each side of the fire-pot of the forge to support 
the box. Fill the box with potassium cyanide and place it on 
the bricks. Build a large fire around the box and as the 
cyanide melts keep adding more until the box is full enough 
to cover the work. 
Caution. Cyanide is very poisonous. Avoid inhaling the 
fumes or getting particles of it in scratches on the hands. 
2. Tie together with small wire the pieces to be hardened 
so that they may be lifted out of the bath. 
8. See that the pieces to be hardened are perfectly dry, 
then drop them gently into a molten red-hot bath of potassium 
cyanide. Keep the cyanide hot as long as the work is in it. 
If the work is to be hardened for a depth of about five thou- 
sandths of an inch leave it in the red-hot bath for an hour. 
For a thicker hardened coat leave it in longer. 
4. Remove the work from the cyanide by means of the wire 
and plunge it in the cooling bath. 
5. If mottled brown spots are wanted as a finish on the 
product use for the cooling bath a solution of saltpeter and 
water. A handful of saltpeter to two gallons of water gives 
the proper strength solution.

DRILLING 
Directions: 
1. Mark the location of the center of the holes to be drilled 
with a center punch. If great accuracy is required, lay out 
the exact size of the hole with dividers and make five or six 
light center-punch marks on this line. 
2. Place the work to be drilled on a wooden block or V- 
block and feed the drill-bit down with the point in the center- 
punch mark until a spot has been drilled about half the 
diameter of the hole. Lift the drill and examine the work by 
means of the center-punch marks to see if the hole is in the 
exact location desired. If it is necessary to shift the hole use 
a small gouge-pointed chisel or a center punch and cut a 
   Fic. 51 
narrow groove down the side of the spot on the side toward 
which the hole is to be moved. This groove should be as deep 
as the distance the drill is off center. A, Fig. 51, shows the 
drill off center; B shows the groove to make the correction; C 
shows how it should appear when in the proper position. 
3. Turn on the automatic feed and start the drill. Put a 
small amount of oil on the drill-bit about two inches above 
the work. Use no oil when drilling cast-iron. 
4. Hold the work securely to prevent the stock from spin- 
ning around when the drill bit cuts thru the stock.

If the size for the tap drill is indicated on the tap, use 
that size in preference to the size given in the table. 
2. Select a taper tap the required size and clamp it securely 
in the tap wrench. If one end of the hole is closed and threads 
must be cut to the bottom of the hole use a plug tap first then 
a bottoming tap. If the depth of the hole will permit it use a 
taper tap first then a plug tap, then a bottoming tap. 
3. Grasp the wrench directly over the tap with one hand 
and place the tap in the hole, being careful that it is in line 
with the hole. Press the tap firmly into the hole and turn it 
to the right. Continue to turn as long as the tap can be turned 
with one hand. 
4. Oil the tap freely then grasp the handles of the tap 
wrench with both hands. With a firm, steady movement con- 
tinue to turn the wrench, turning backward slightly every two 
turns, until the tap is thru the hole.

CUTTING THREADS 
Directions: 
1. Point slightly with a file the rod or bolt to be threaded 
and clamp securely in the vise. 
2. Choose a die the required size, fasten it in the stock, and 
place it over the end of the work where threads are to be cut. 
38. Grasp the stock close up to the die, press firmly against 
the work and at the same time turn to the right, being sure 
to keep the die straight on the work. 
4. Oil the end of the work and continue to turn the stock 
rocking it backward slightly every two revolutions until the 
thread is cut the required length. 
5. Remove the die by turning it to the left. 
6. If left hand threads are to be cut use a left hand die 
and turn the die to the left.

BENDING PIPE 
Directions: 
1. When bending a piece of pipe it tends to collapse in the 
direction of the bend and spread in the opposite direction. 
Since it cannot collapse unless it is permitted to spread, 
any means that will prevent its spreading will prevent its 
collapse. 
2. Where only a 
few pieces of small 
pipe are to be bent 
they should be 
clamped lightly in a 
vise or clamp, at the 
point where the bend 
is to be made, to pre- 
vent the spreading of 
the sides, and bend 
the pipe in the direc- 
tion of the opening 
of the jaws. 
Fig. 52 The seam of the 
pipe should be on the 
inside of the bend slightly to one side of the center. 
3. A very effective and convenient method is to fasten up 
a heavy board or plank and bore a hole in it about 14” larger 
in diameter than the pipe. Slip the pipe thru the hole 
and bend slightly. Shift the pipe forward or backward 
as the bending is continued in order to secure the desired 
curve. Fig. 52. Fig. 53 shows another pipe bending 
device. 
4. A hickey may be used to bend small pipe by placing the 
hickey on the pipe where the curve is to begin, stand on the 
pipe and pull on the handle of the hickey until the pipe bends 
slightly, then move the hickey a little farther on the curve and

bend again. Continue this until the desired curve is obtained. 
Fig. 54. 
  Fic. 53 
5. Bend a large pipe by placing a cap on the end and heat- 
ing to an even red heat where the bend is to be made, and 
while one end is supported on some object drop the other end 
on the ground or floor.

RIVETING 
Directions: 
1. Press together firmly the pieces to be riveted and select 
a rivet large enough to fit the hole snugly, and long enough 
to extend thru the hole for heading a distance equal to the 
diameter of the rivet. If the rivet is too long cut it off with 
the nippers and square it with a file. 
2. Put the rivet in the rivet hole and rest the head on the 
solid portion of the anvil. Hold the pieces firmly together 
and strike medium heavy blows in the center of the end of the 
rivet with the peen of the ball-peen hammer. Then, with the 
face of the hammer strike squarely on the end of the rivet until 
the pieces being riveted are fastened firmly together,*and the 
end of the rivet extends above the pieces one-half its original 
distance. 
3. Raise the handle of the hammer and strike around the 
circumference of the end of the rivet at an angle of 45 degrees 
until an oval top is formed, the edge of which fits snugly 
against the stock being riveted. 
4. Finish by striking a medium heavy blow directly on top 
of the rivet. 
5. Finish the rivet top with a rivet set if one is available. 
6. If the work is of such character that it cannot be placed 
on the anvil hold a heavy sledge against the rivet head while 
riveting. 
7. If a straight rivet is being used where the head is to 
be formed on both ends use a rivet that is long enough to 
extend on each side approximately the diameter of the rivet. 
8. Place the rivet thru the holes, press the pieces firmly 
together, and set the rivet on end on the face of the anvil with 
the pieces to be riveted half way between the top and bottom 
of the rivet. In this position strike a heavy blow on the end 
of the rivet with the peen of ball-peen hammer then turn the 
work over and strike the other end of the rivet in like manner.
-P-A-G-E-68
68 Operation No. 27 
Page No. 2 
Then strike the ends of the rivet alternately with the face of 
the hammer until the ends stick out from the work a distance 
equal to half the diameter of the rivet. Then finish with a 
rivet set or by striking around the end at an angle of 45 
degrees. 
9. If two pieces are to be riveted together that must move 
with reference to each other, as in the case of shears, ete., 
place a piece of paper between the members before riveting. 
10. In all cases of riveting, the work may be done with 
greater ease if the rivets are first heated.

REMOVING BROKEN STUD BOLT 
Directions: 
1. If the stud bolt extends above the surface, flatten the 
sides so that an ordinary wrench may be used or use a pipe 
wrench to screw it out. 
2. If the stud seems very tight when the pressure of the 
wrench is on it strike the end of the stud with the hammer 
while trying to screw it out. 
3. If the stud is broken off even with the surface make a 
center-punch mark in the end and 
drill a hole in it about one inch deep 
and about half the diameter of the 
stud. 
4. Choose an ‘‘Hzy Out’’ with a 
twist in the opposite direction to the 
direction of the threads and one 
whose diameter is slightly smaller 
than the hole and start it into the 
hole. Put a wrench or handle on 
the ‘‘Ezy Out’’ and with slow steady 
pressure turn in the direction that 
will unscrew the stud. Fig. 55. 
5. If an ‘‘Ezy Out’? is not avail- 
able, drive a piece of tempered steel 
tapered to a square into the hole 
until the corners are imbedded in the side of the hole. Use 
a wrench on the steel to take the stud out. 
6. If the stud is still stuck fast, drill a hole exactly in the 
middle of the stud large enough so that only a thin rim of 
the stud is left. With a small fine pointed chisel pry out the 
rim of the stud. 
7. If the stud is rusted tightly in the hole apply heat until 
the expansion of the material breaks the rust, then twist the 
stud out.

8. If the projecting stud is to be removed without injury to 
the thread on the projecting end, screw on a nut until the 
stud projects thru the nut a little more than its thickness. 
Screw on a second nut until it is tight against the first as a 
lock nut. Apply a wrench to the first nut and unscrew the 
stud.

SAWING WITH HACK-SAW 
Directions: 
1. To fit a hack-saw blade in a frame, grasp the hack-saw 
frame near the middle with the left hand. Attach the blade 
at the end of the frame opposite the handle so that the teeth 
of the saw point away from the handle. Adjust the frame 
to the length of the blade and fasten the blade in the handle 
end. Screw the handle to the right or tighten the wing nut 
to the other end of the frame until the blade is perfectly tight 
and will not buckle. 
2. If loose work is to be sawed clamp it securely in the vise. 
3. To saw thin work or tubing use a blade with fine teeth, 
about 24 teeth to the inch. For general purposes use a blade 
with about 16 or 18 teeth to the inch. 
4. Grasp the handle of the hack-saw with the right hand, 
the left hand holding the opposite end of the frame. Fig. 56.

  Fic. 56 
5. Start the cut by applying light steady pressure on the 
forward stroke and relieving it on the return stroke. In 
starting out with new blades use extreme care in making the 
first few strokes. 
6. Use long steady strokes, applying slight pressure on the 
forward stroke and releasing on the backward stroke until the 
cut is finished. Make about forty strokes per minute.

7. In starting a cut on a sharp corner notch the work with 
a file or cold chisel enough so that at least two teeth will 
engage. 
8. In sawing very thin stock place it in a vise between two 
pieces of wood and saw thru the wood and metal at the same 
time. 
9. In sawing thin stock incline the handle of the saw so 
that as many teeth as possible will be engaged at one time. 
10. When finishing a cut raise the handle of the saw 
slightly so as to avoid the teeth catching on the thin, sharp 
edge of the stock. 
Questions: 
1. Why is it important to have the correct tension on the blade while 
sawing? 
2. Why should a fine-toothed blade be used on tubing and thin work? 
3. Why use special care in starting new blades? 
4. Why start the cut on a sharp corner with a file or cold chisel? 
5. Why hold the saw frame with both hands?

SOLDERING 
Directions: 
1. Tin the soldering copper as follows. Heat the point and 
brighten it with a file. Re-heat until it will melt the solder 
freely and rub the point of the copper on a lump of sal-am- 
moniac to clean it. Melt a few drops of solder on the sal- 
ammoniac and rub the copper in it until the solder sticks to 
the copper. A little powdered rosin on a brick or board will 
do instead of sal-ammoniac. 
2. Keep the copper clean by occasionally dipping it quickly 
while hot in a solution of sal-ammoniac. Make a solution by 
mixing one part sal-ammoniac with twenty parts water. 
3. Place the pieces of metal in position ready for soldering 
and fasten them so they will not become displaced while 
soldering. If it is old work scrape the seam clean. 
4. Apply to the seam a flux suited to the work as follows: 
For galvanized iron, use raw muriatic acid. 
   
-P-A-G-E-74
  74 Operation No. 30 
Page No. 2 
For copper, brass, zine and iron use cut acid or chloride 
of zine. 
(Cut acid is muriatic acid in which has been placed all 
the small pieces of zinc it will dissolve.) 
For bright tin use powdered rosin. 
Specially prepared fluxes may be used for purposes 
recommended by manufacturers. 
5. Heat the soldering copper until it will melt solder 
freely but it must not be hot enough to burn off the tinning. 
Hold the hot copper about three inches from your cheek for 
an instant and note the heat. With a little practice this will 
enable one to judge the proper heat. 
6. With the hot copper tack the seam together at several 
points with drops of solder, Fig. 57, so as to hold the parts 
in proper position while soldering. 
  Fic. 58 
7. Place the point of the hot, tinned soldering copper on 
the edge of the seam and touch the copper with a bar of 
solder. Move the copper slowly along the seam for a short 
distance. As the copper melts the solder, deposit a small quan- 
tity along the edge of the seam. Move the copper back to the 
starting point and hold one of the flat sides of the copper 
on the seam until the metal becomes as hot as the melted 
solder then move the copper along the seam slowly enough 
to remelt the solder deposited along the edge and permit it 
to flow in between the laps of the seam. Do not move the

copper back and forth and do not use too much solder. 
Fig. 58. 
8. When changing or reheating the copper, hold the hot 
one at the point where you left off, long enough to remelt the 
solder under the seam. 
9. To sweat pieces together apply flux, and tin with solder 
the surfaces to be joined. Place the tinned surfaces together 
and heat with torch or soldering copper until the solder melts. 
Hold the pieces together until the solder cools.

BRAZING 
Directions: 
1. Brighten with an emery cloth or with a file the parts to 
be brazed. 
2. Fasten the parts together so the joint fits snugly and so 
they will remain in position while brazing. 
3. Direct the torch flame on the joint until the metal be- 
comes a dark red. 
4. Apply powdered borax to the seam and return to the 
flame until the borax melts. 
5. Remove the work from the flame and apply a small 
amount of spelter over the seam. Hold it in the flame again 
until the spelter melts and runs thru the seam, then remove 
it from the flame, and with a piece of metal wipe from the 
surface the surplus spelter before it hardens. When cold 
smooth the seam with a file.

BABBITTING AND SCRAPING BEARINGS 
Directions: 
1. Clean thoroly the box to be babbitted and be sure that 
no moisture is left on the surface. 
2. Select a babbitting mandrel for the job to be done. In 
many jobs the regular shaft or journal must be used, but use 
a special mandrel when possible. If the bearing is to be bored 
and reamed use a mandrel slightly smaller than the shaft. 
3. Cover the babbitting mandrel with a coating of graphite 
mixed with gasoline, wrap a piece of thin paper around it, or 
smoke it with a candle if babbitting a solid bearing. 
4. Have the bearing shell in a vertical position whenever 
possible. 
5. Put the babbitting mandrel in place and line it up so 
that the shaft will be in its required position with reference to 
the bearing shell. In the case of a crank shaft place the man- 
drel equidistant from the bearing shell on all sides for the 
twé end bearings. Then place the shaft in position in these 
two bearings and pour the others so that they will be in line. 
6. Fill all oil holes with asbestos. In cases where the bear- 
ing must be poured thru oil holes leave the most convenient 
one open. 
7. Make joints tight with putty. If there is a space of a 
quarter inch or more, wooden or cardboard heads should be 
cut to fit the mandrel and clamped in place or backed up 
with putty. In all cases ample vents must be left for the 
escape of air and gases while the bearing is being poured. 
8. Make a funnel of putty around the hole thru which the 
metal is to be poured. 
9. Secure more than enough babbitt of the required grade, 
put it in a cast-iron pot or ladle, and place it over a forge 
fire or gas burner. When the metal is molten cover it with 
powdered coal or dust. The babbitt is ready to pour when it 
will char a freshly whittled pine stick brown in three or four 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
78 Operation No. 32 
Page No. 2 
seconds. If the stick trembles in the fingers and smoke rises, 
the metal is too hot. Care should be taken not to allow this 
condition to occur. 
10. When possible heat the bearing box and mandrel until 
it is quite hot to the touch before pouring the bearing. 
11. When everything is in readiness to pour, sprinkle a 
little powdered rosin on the surface of the babbitt and stir. 
With a warm ladle dip from the bottom of the pot. Bring 
the ladle up quickly so as to force back the dirt on top of the 
pot. If the babbitt is melted in the ladle that is to be used 
for pouring, do not skim off the top but use a helper to hold 
back the scum as the metal is being poured. Pour the metal 
into the bearing in a clean steady stream as large as the open- 
ing will allow. Never falter or hesitate during the pouring 
operation since the bearing must be filled by a continuous 
stream of metal. Ona large bearing use two ladles if possible 
and pour from opposite corners of the bearing. 
12. When the babbitt has hardened, remove the fixtures 
and the mandrel and take out the plugs from the oil holes. 
13. In cases where the bearing is to be in halves, place a 
cardboard shim between the halves and let it extend over to 
the mandrel or the shaft. Cut a V-shaped hole in the card- 
board next to the mandrel or shaft so that the metal may 
reach and fill the under half. Holes must not be cut larger 
than a quarter of an inch even for large bearings. 
14. File the surfaces of each half smooth, and level the cor- 
ners. Remove the fins or burs with a draw-knife or file. Any 
holes filled with a babbitt may be cleaned out with a hot iron. 
15. If shrinkage occurs, peen the babbitt to tighten it by 
hammering lightly along the center of the bearing with the 
round end of a ball-peen hammer. Extend the blows on either 
side of the center line until babbitt is tight. 
16. Place the halves of bearing together, with the shim 
between, screw down tight and ream or bore to approximately 
the size of the shaft. 
17. Place the shaft in the bearing, screw the cap down in 
place. Turn the shaft a few turns, remove the cap and note

where shaft rubbed on the bearing. Scrape these high places 
down with the bearing scraper. Coat the shaft with Prus- 
sian blue and replace in bearing. Turn in the bearing sev- 
eral times, re- 
move it and with 
a bearing scraper, 
scrape off the blue 
spots left on the 
bearing. Continue 
this process until 
the shaft will leave 
seventy-five per 
cent of the bearing surface blue when turned init. See Figs. 
59 and 60. 
18. Where oil holes are to be small, and have not been 
preserved by the use of a plug, drill new oil holes.

FILING 
Directions: 
1. Clamp the work firmly in the vise with the surface to 
be filed in a horizontal position. 
2. If much material is to be removed use a flat bastard eut 
file and finish with a double-cut second-cut file. The size of the 
work will determine the size of the file used. 
3. Grasp the handle of the file with the right hand and 
hold the end between the thumb and fingers of the left hand. 
Fig. 61. When using a large file for making heavy cuts, place 
the weight of the hand on the end of the file.

4. Hold the file firmly and push it in a straight line across 
the work, being careful that the pressure is uniform and that 
the front end of the file does not dip near the end of the stroke. 
If a curved surface is being filed push the file in such a way 
that it follows the curve of the work. 
5. Release the pressure on the backward stroke of the file. 
6. If the surface being filed tends to become high in the 
center, place the end of the file about the center of the high 
place, elevate the handle slightly, apply pressure on the file

HOW TO SHARPEN A SAW 
Directions: 
To Sharpen a Rip-Saw: 
1. Arrange a saw vise or clamp so the best light to be 
secured will shine on the side of the saw next to the operator 
and so the top of the vise will be at a level nearly with the 
height of the arm pits. 
2. Examine the saw teeth for evenness of length by sight- 
ing down the rows of teeth, and also for depth of gullets. A 
gullet should never be less than one-half, nor more than all 
of the distance between the points. For slow cutting in hard 
wood a shallow gullet is required and for fast cutting, a deep 
gullet. For general purposes make the depth of the gullet 
three-fourths the distance between points. 
3. If all the teeth are not of the same length, top-joint 
them as follows: 
(a) Clamp the saw in a vise so that its teeth extend 2 or 3 
inches above the vise jaws. 
(b) Hold a 10 or 12-inch flat mill file, tang toward you, in 
both hands so the extended thumbs will lie together 
along the top side of the file, and the closed fingers 
will form a guide on each side of the saw blade. 
(c) Begin at the handle end of the saw, and with the file 
held level, run it over the teeth the entire length of the 
blade until all the teeth are made the same length. 
Note: Files do not cut on return strokes. 
4, If the saw is in bad condition do not continue to top- 
joint until all the teeth are of the same length, but joint off 
one-fourth the length of all the longer teeth, then file them to 
an approximate shape and top-joint again. 
5. Secure a saw-set and adjust it so as to give only enough 
set to the teeth to allow the blade to slip readily thru the 
wood; and measuring from the top of a tooth, make the bend 
for the set not more than one-half the length of the tooth.
-P-A-G-E-83
  Operation No. 34 83 
Page No. 2 
6. To set the rip-saw, rest the end of the blade, tooth edge 
up, against some solid object, as a bench top, and hold along 
the back of the blade with the left hand, so that the handle 
will rest against the body. Bend every other tooth outward, 
then turn the saw around and bend the remaining teeth in the 
opposite direction. 
7. To file the rip-saw use a 5” slim taper, triangular file 
for saws with eight or more points to inch, and a 6” file for 
seven or less. 
8. Clamp the saw in a saw vise so that its handle end is to 
the left and the teeth are not more than 14” above the saw- 
vise jaws. 
9. Grasp the handle of the file in the right hand, the thumb 
on top, and the point in the left hand, between the thumb and 
forefinger, the thumb on top. 
10. Beginning at the handle end of the saw, place the file 
between two of the teeth so that its left side will be in contact 
with the first tooth that slants away from the worker. 
11. Hold the file level and at right angles to the saw blade. 
Keep its left side in a vertical position. 
12. Run the file its full length across the teeth, maintaining 
a uniform movement and slight pressure on the forward stroke 
only. Relieve all weight on return strokes; do not drag the 
file. 
13. Hold your hands so that every stroke will be made in 
the same direction. 
14. File all teeth that point away from the worker, taking 
not more than three strokes across each tooth and skipping 
all low teeth until the high teeth are cut level with the low. 
15. Run the saw handle end to the right, and file the re- 
maining teeth. 
16. When taking the second or third stroke of the file, sight 
to see that its left side is in contact with all of the front side 
of the left tooth and the right side in contact with all of the 
back side of the right tooth. 
17. File all the teeth so that the front side is vertical and 
all the gullets of the same depth. If some of the teeth are
-P-A-G-E-84
84 Operation No. 34 
Page No. 3 
of uneven size, crowd the file against the larger tooth and 
bear lightly against the smaller, until all are of the same size. 
18. Side joint the teeth by laying the saw blade on a flat 
board and run a fine mill file or an oilstone lightly along the 
side of the blade and teeth, then turn the saw over and joint 
the other side. 
To Sharpen Crosscut-Saw: 
1. Read carefully the directions for sharpening a rip-saw. 
2. Top-joint, then set by bending every other tooth toward 
its point. 
3. To file, begin at the handle end; place the file between 
two of the teeth; slant its top side slightly toward the tooth 
in front; point its end in the direction of the small end of the 
saw so that it forms an angle of 45 degrees with the side of the 
saw; then file from one side all teeth that point away from 
the worker. 
4. Turn the saw and file the remaining teeth, then side 
joint.

SETTING WAGON TIRE 
Directions: 
1. Remove the wheel from the wagon and lay it on the 
ground, the point of the hub down. 
2. Make a cold-chisel mark on the edge of the tire and 
extend it across on the felloe. 
3. If two front or two rear tires are to be set at the same 
time, mark one of them with one mark and the other with two 
marks. 
4. Stand the wheel on edge with the point of the hub to 
the left, and remove the tire by striking on the right side of 
the felloe just under the tire. Continue around the rim until 
the tire is free. 
5. If the tire refuses to slip, even tho it is apparently loose, 
it is probably being held on by short iron pins driven thru the 
tire. Locate the pins by driving a thin chisel between the tire 
and the felloe and looking thru the crack. Place a large sledge 
against the edge of the tire at the place where the pin is and 
eut the pin off by driving a very thin cold chisel between the 
felloe and the tire. 
6. When the tire is free from the felloe, remove the cut 
pins from the tire and the felloe and examine the wheels for 
loose spokes and broken felloes: 
7. Renew the felloes if any broken or split ones are found, 
and tighten the spokes in the felloes by driving hickory 
wedges, crosswise of the rim, in the end of the spoke tenons. 
First split the spoke tenon with a thin chisel, start the wedge, 
then strike alternately on the wedge and the felloe until the 
spoke is tight. 
8. If the rim tends to become rim bound during the process 
of wedging, make a saw cut between the ends of the felloes at 
one joint as the wedging proceeds. 
9. When all the spokes are wedged, run a saw thru between 
the ends of the felloes at one joint until they slide loosely
-P-A-G-E-86
  86 Operation No. 35 
Page No. 2 
past each other. Redowel the joint between the felloes where 
it has been cut with the saw. 
10. Place the wheel on the trestle, the point of the hub 
down. Drive a small block of wood between two spokes that 
have an opening in the rim between them and wedge until all 
the opening in the rim is between these two spokes. 
  11. Grasp the tire measuring wheel (Fig. 63) by the 
handle and place zero graduation mark of the measuring wheel 
even with the right hand side of the opening between the ends 
of the felloes. Walk around the wheel to the right, letting 
the tire measuring wheel travel on the outside of the rim, near 
the center. Fig. 64. Go clear around the wheel and when 
the tire measuring wheel crosses the opening, stop and set the 
pointer on the wheel even with the left side of the opening 
between the ends. of the felloes. 
  12. Place the tire down over your head with one edge rest- 
ing on the anvil and the other on the forge. Make a pencil 
mark across the tire on the inside. Set the zero graduation 
mark of the measuring wheel even with this mark and travel
-P-A-G-E-87
  
Operation No. 35 87 
Page No. 3 
to the right around the tire. Proceed until the pencil mark 
is reached. The distance the pointer lacks in coming up even 
with the mark, or the distance to the left of the mark is the 
amount the tire is larger than the rim. If the tire is the same 
size as the rim the pointer will come even with the mark. If 
the pointer falls to the right of the mark the tire is smaller 
than the rim. When shrunk, the tire should be from 14” to 
5/16” smaller than the rim in order to give a draw. 
  Fia. 65 
13. Heat the tire and place it in the tire shrinker. Fig. 
65. Clamp and shrink, meanwhile hammering down any kinks 
that may be forming. Remove from the shrinker, place on 
the anvil, first on the edge then flatwise, hammering as you 
do so, until the tire is smooth. Run or measure the tire to see 
if it has enough draw. Repeat these operations until the 
pointer of the tire measuring wheel falls from 14” to 5/16” 
to the right of the pencil mark. The amount of the draw 
will depend upon the thickness of the tire and the condition

Page No, 4 
of the wheel. Very old, loose wheels may require as much 
as a 34” draw. If a very accurate job is required, cool the 
tire before measuring. 
14. Place the tire upright in the large forge fire, support- 
ing it on bricks placed on each side of the fire pot. Have a 
chisel mark on the tire next to the chimney. Heat to a red 
heat, then turn the tire in the fire about a foot, and heat 
again. Continue to heat and turn until the tire is hot all the 
way around. Turn the tire down so it lies flat on the forge, 
grasp it with tongs to the left of the chisel mark. Place the 
tire on the rim so that the chisel mark on the tire and the 
mark on the felloe coincide. With a tire puller (Fig. 66) ora 
wide-jawed pair of tongs in the left hand and a hammer in 
the right, force the tire down over the rim by clamping over 
the top edge of the tire and under the edge of the rim and

striking the inside edge of the tire with the hammer at an 
angle of 45 degrees. 
15. When the tire is in place and as the cooling proceeds, 
remove the wheel to the slack tub and hammer over the ends of 
the spokes. Have a helper turn the wheel in the slack tub 
and with a hand hammer in each hand even up the tire on the 
rim by holding one hammer against the tire and striking the 
rim on the opposite side. To take out irregularities in a curva-

ture, continue to strike on the ends of the spokes until the tire 
is cold. 
16. If more than one wagon tire is to be set, shrink all the 
tires to the required size and then stack them on four bricks 
in the shop yard with all the chisel marks together and on 
the top side. Stack around them finely split dry wood or 
bark and start a fire. Arrange the wheels in the order for 
receiving the tires and place the first wheel on trestles. When 
the fire dies down sufficiently draw out one tire with a hook 
or tongs and place on the wheel. If the tire is very hot and 
is burning the rim pour water on before removing from the 
trestles.

Questions: 
1. Why is the tire taken off towards the inside of the wheel rather than 
the outside? 
2. Why is it a bad practice to drive pins that extend only part way 
thru a felloe thru the tire to hold it on? 
3. What is the effect of too much draw? 
4, How can you prevent excessive dishing and still draw a wheel per- 
fectly tight? 
5. Why mark the tire and rim before the tire is removed? 
6. When working on wheels of approximately the same size, why place 
different marks on the wheels? 
7. Why put in wedges crosswise of the felloe? 
8. In wedging spokes why strike alternately on the wedge and felloc? 
9. Why put dowels in the ends of felloes? 
10. Why should a tire be replaced on a wheel in the same relative posi- 
tion as when it was removed?

SETTING BUGGY TIRE 
Directions: 
1. Unscrew the nuts and drive out the bolts as far as they 
ean be conveniently driven with a hammer and remove with 
a large pair of end pinchers. Place the wheel on a bench- 
wheel rack, (Fig. 67) the point of the hub up; and clamp 
securely. With a file or cold chisel make a shallow mark near 
one of the joints of the rim. 
2. Set the wheel on edge, 
point the hub to the left, and 
remove the tire by striking the 
rim on the side just under the 
tire. If the tire is rather tight, 
turn the wheel so that the tire 
slips the same amount all the 
way around. Continue until the 
tire is free from the rim. 
38. Replace on the wheel rack, 
screw down, and examine the 
rim for splits and ends of 
spokes for wear or broken 
tenons. Examine at the hub to 
see if spokes are loose. If the 
rim does not fit closely on the 
ends of the spokes, the wheel is rim bound. 
4, If the wheel is rim bound, saw a very small amount off 
one end of one of the half rims. Split the ends of the tenons 
of the spokes crosswise of the rim with a thin chisel, and 
wedge with hickory wedges. Start a wedge in the end of the 
spoke, then hit the rim at the side of the wedge. Continue 
to strike alternately the rim and the wedge until the rim fits 
down snugly on the shoulder of the spoke. Continue around 
the rim until all the spokes are wedged. If during the wedg- 
ing process the ends of the rim come together, and the wheel

is rim bound again saw out a small amount at the opening. 
Usually a saw cut thru an opening between rim halves is 
sufficient. Continue to saw and wedge until the halves slide 
loosely past each other. 
5. Remove the wheel from the wheel rack and place on 
trestles, the point of the hub down. 
6. If the wheel is loose in the hub and has too much dish, 
saw out more of the rim, usually from 1/16” to 14”, the amount 
depending upon how much you think the spokes can be driven 
into the hub. Place on a wheel rack (Fig. 68) so that the 
wheel may be screwed down to prevent too much dishing. 
Screw down until pressure is on the hub and the rim is rest- 
ing firmly on the frame. 
  Fic. 68. Rack for fastening down 
wheel to prevent too much dish. 
7. Drive a small block of wood between the two spokes 
that come on either side of one of the openings in the rim. 
Wedge down until all the opening in the rim is at one place. 
8. Grasp a tire measuring wheel by the handle and place 
the zero graduation mark of the measuring wheel at the right 
hand side of the opening between the ends of the rim. Walk 
around the wheel to the right, letting the wheel travel on the 
outside of the rim. Go clear around the wheel and when the 
tire measuring wheel crosses the opening, stop and set the 
pointer on the wheel even with the left side of the opening.
-P-A-G-E-92
  92 Operation No. 36 
Page No. 3 
9. Place the tire down over your head with one edge rest- 
ing on the anvil and the other on the forge. Make a pencil 
mark across the tire on the inside. Set the zero graduation 
mark of the measuring wheel even with this mark and travel 
to the right around the tire. Proceed until the pencil mark 
is reached. The distance the pointer lacks in coming even 
with the mark, or the distance to the left of the mark, is the 
amount the tire is larger than the rim. If the tire is the same 
size as the rim the pointer will come even with the mark. If 
the pointer falls to the right of the mark the tire is smaller 
than the rim. When shrunk, the tire should be from 1/16” 
to 14” smaller than the rim in order to give a draw. 
10. Heat the tire and place it in the tire shrinker. Clamp 
and shrink, meanwhile hammering down any kinks that may 
be forming. Remove the tire from the shrinker and place it 
on the anvil, first on the edge and then flatwise, and hammer 
until the tire is smooth. Run or measure the tire to see if it 
has enough draw. Repeat these operations until the pointer 
of the tire measuring wheel falls from 1/16” to 14” to the right 
of the pencil mark on the tire, depending on the condition of 
the wheel. If a very accurate job is required cool the tire be- 
fore measuring. 
11. Place the tire in a forge fire with a mark on the edge 
next to the chimney of the forge, the tire standing straight up. 
Heat until it is red hot. Turn the tire in the fire for about a 
foot and heat again until it is red hot. Continue to turn and 
heat until the tire is hot all the way around. Turn the tire 
down so it lies flat on the forge, grasp it with tongs to the 
right of the file mark, take the tire bolt in the right hand, and 
proceed to the wheel. Place the tire on the rim so that the file 
mark on the rim and the file mark on the tire coincide, and 
slip the bolt thru the hole. With a tire puller or wide-jawed 
pair of tongs in the left hand and a hammer in the right hand, 
force the tire down over the rim by clamping over the top 
edge of the tire and striking with the hammer at an angle of 
about 45 degrees. 
12. When the tire is in place, hammer over the end of the

Page No. 4 
spokes. If the wheel is not screwed down, remove to the slack 
tub, place upright on the edge and turn thru water until the 
tire is cold, meanwhile evening up the tire on the rim by 
striking over the ends of the spokes. Hammer down any 
irregularities in the curvature of the tire until it fits the rim 
snugly. 
13. If the wheel is screwed down on the wheel rack, pour 
water on the rim until cold, meanwhile hammering over the 
ends of the spokes to drive tightly into the hub. Even up the 
tire on the rim by holding the heavy hammer on the tire and 
striking on the rim with another hammer. If the draw of the. 
tire tends to dish the wheel rather than pull the spokes into 
the hub, screw down as the tire cools. 
14. Replace the wheel on the bench wheel rack, screw down 
and use a wood drill and brace to open up the bolt holes. Put 
in bolts. 
15. If the wheel is rather loose in the hub, place it on the 
anvil, the point of the hub up so that the head of the hub 
rivets are resting on the edge of the anvil. In this position 
place a wheel rivet set punch on the rivets and deliver blows 
until the spokes are tight, continuing around the hub until 
all are tight. 
Questions: 
1. Why is it necessary to have the inside of the wheel up when placed 
on the wheel rack ready to receive the tire? 
2. Why do we mark the tire? 
3. Why is it unnecessary to count the revolutions of the tire measuring 
wheel as it goes around the rim? 
4. Why should the tire be cooled before measuring when an accurate 
job is required? 
5. Why is it necessary to open up bolt holes with a wood drill? 
6. What is the appearance of the spokes at the hub when they are 
loose? 
7. What are the indications of a rim bound condition of the wheel?

resting on the forge and the other on the anvil. 
9. Set the zero 
graduation mark of 
the measuring wheel 
even with the right 
end of the tire as 
you face the opening. 
Fig. 71. 
10. Travel to the 
right around the tire, 
counting the revolu- 
tions as you do so, 
until as many revo- 
lutions have been 
counted as were 
counted in measur- 
ing the wheel and, in 
addition, travel until 
the pointer rests on the tire. Mark the tire at this point. 
11. Cut the tire off with a hot or cold cutter a distance 
to the right of this mark equal to the thickness of the tire 
to allow for 
welding. 
12. Prepare 
the end of the 
tire for welding 
by making an 
abrupt bevel on 
the top side of 
both ends. Be Fig. 72 
careful not to allow the bevel to exceed one and one-half 
times the thickness of the stock. Turn the tire down on edge 
and hammer on the edge of the bevel until the point of the 
scarf is slightly narrower than the heel. Fig. 72.

13. Spring the tire until the beveled ends are exactly even 
but one is about four inches directly over the other. 
14. Flux the ends while red hot, and spring the tire until 
the end that is highest can be pushed under the one that is 
lowest. Lap the ends slightly more than the length of the 
bevel and hammer on the heel of the top bevel until the tire 
is in line and the ends fit together. Fig. 73.

15. Place it in the fire and take heat very slowly. 
16. Turn off the blast occasionally so that the top end will 
be heated as fast as the bottom end. 
17. When both ends are to a welding heat remove to the 
anvil and deliver blows until the ends are stuck. Then turn 
on its side and hammer the edge until the tire is uniform in 
width. 
18. Take another heat and dress down the weld. 
19. Measure, then shrink or stretch the tire until it is the 
required size for the wheel. 
20. Put the tire on the wheel as directed in Operations 
No. 35 and No. 36. 
21. In cases where tires are to be bolted on, mark the tire 
with a center punch at points where the holes are required.

RENEWING WAGON FELLOES 
Directions: 
1. Remove the tire and place the wheel on the bench wheel 
rack, the point of the hub up. 
2. Screw the wheel down, saw thru the crack at the ends 
of the broken felloe and remove the broken felloe by hammer- 
ing on the inside of the felloe alternately on each side of the 
spokes. 
3. Choose a felloe that has the same curvature, the same 
width, the same thickness, and one that is slightly longer than 
the one removed. 
4. Lay a new felloe flat on the spoke tenons, the inside 
edge resting against the shoulders of the spokes and the ends 
extending slightly past the ends of the two adjacent felloes. 
Mark the top of the felloe to indicate the top side. 
5. Hold the felloe in this position and make pencil marks 
across on the underside of the new felloe at the points where 
it laps on the old. Make marks across the underside of the 
felloe on each side of the spoke tenons. 
6. Use a try square to make a straight line across the ends 
of the felloes at the points marked, and square guide lines 
across the face. 
7. Saw off the ends leaving all of the pencil lines on the 
felloe. 
8. Clamp the felloe in the vise with the inside toward you, 
the jaws of the vise resting on the sides of the felloe, and 
the guide lines locating a hole for one of the tenons above the 
vise and in a convenient position for boring. Select a bit the 
size of a tenon, center it carefully from left to right on the 
inside of the felloe and with the point exactly in the center 
between the two tenon guide lines, bore the hole. Be careful 
that the bit keeps the direction of the guide lines and does 
not change the direction, right or left. Repeat these opera- 
tions for the other holes.

them down by hitting first over one hole and then the other. 
10. When the ends of the felloe tend to wedge, run a saw 
thru between the ends. 
11. Continue to run the saw thru and hammer over the 
holes until the felloe rests firmly on the shoulder of the spokes. 
12. With a chisel split the ends of the spokes crosswise | 
of the felloe and wedge with hickory wedges. 
13. Put a clamp on the felloe at the joints to hold them in 
position and with a 3%” bit bore a hole thru the end of the 
felloes, forming a 45 degree angle with the joint. 
14. Insert a dowel pin, remove the clamp, saw off the dowel 
and dress down the new felloe with a wood rasp until it con- 
forms to the shape of the old felloe. 
Questions: 
1, Why bore the tenon holes from the inside of the felloe? 
2. Why use wood instead of iron dowels? 
3. In inserting a new felloe why cut it slightly longer than the distance 
between the ends of the old felloe? 
4, What is the purpose of dowels?

RENEWING HALF. RIMS 
Directions: 
1. Remove the tire from the wheel and screw the wheel 
down on the bench wheel rack, the point of the hub up. 
2. Remove the old half rim by striking blows on the inside 
of the rim on either side of the spokes. Strike the inside of 
the rim near each spoke so that the rim slips off all of the

3. Renew any spokes that may be broken or. worn badly 
at the tenons. 
4. If the shoulders of the spokes at the tenon are slightly 
worn, square all shoulders very slightly with a tenoner, or 
hollow auger. 
5. Choose a half rim that is the same width, thickness, and 
curvature as the old one and one whose ends extend slightly 
past the ends of the other half when it is held in place on the 
tenons. 
6. Clamp the new half rim in position so that its ends 
extend over the ends of the half rim remaining on the wheel 
and the rest of it lies on top of the tenons and against the 
shoulders of the tenons. Mark the rim so as to indicate the 
top side. With a pencil in the right hand and your left side 
to the wheel, back around the new half rim meanwhile press-

where the length was marked and saw off, leaving all the mark 
on the rim. 
11. Start the rim on the tenons, beginning at one end. 
When one tenon is started, go to the next spoke. Bend it 
until the tenon will start in the hole. If the ones that have 
been started tend to pull out when the next ones are being 
started drive the rim on a little farther. Continue until all 
the tenons are started in the holes, then strike alternately on 
all the holes until the ends of the new rim strike the ends of 
the old. When the ends begin to wedge, run a saw between 
them. 
12. Continue to run the saw thru between the ends and 
drive down the rim until it rests firmly on the shoulders of 
the tenons and the ends slide loosely past each other. 
13. Split the ends of the tenons crosswise of the rim with a 
thin chisel and start hickory wedges. Strike the wedges, then 
rim until the rim rests firmly on the shoulders and all the 
tenons are tight. If during the wedging process the wheel 
tends to become rim bound continue to run the saw between 
the ends. 
14. Dress down the new rim with a wood rasp until it con- 
forms in shape to the old rim. 
Questions: 
1. Why bore the tenon holes from the inside of the half rim? 
2. Why is it necessary to hold the rim firmly against the shoulder on 
the tenon when marking the location of the tenon holes? 
3. Why is it necessary to start all the tenons in the tenon holes before 
any of them are driven up? 
4. Why is it necessary to have the rim rest firmly on the shoulder 
before the wedge is tightened?

REPLACING SPOKES 
Directions: 
1. If a wagcn spoke is to be replaced, remove the tire, 
clamp the wheel on the bench wheel rack, and remove the rim 
or felloe. Grasp the stub of the old spoke and with a heavy 
hammer strike a flat blow on top of the spoke near the hub. 
Continue to strike with a lighter blow meanwhile bending the 
spoke up and down as far as it will go. As soon as it is 
loose in the hub grasp with both hands, work up and down, 
and pull out. 
2. If the tenon breaks off in the hub choose a wood drill 
slightly smaller than the thickness of the tenon and bore 
holes close together the entire width of the tenon, being care- 
ful to keep the bit pointed toward the center line of the hub. 
With a flat chisel about the width of the thickness of the 
broken tenon, clean out the mortise. 
3. Choose a spoke the required length and size. Gage the 
depth of the mortise and cut the tenon slightly shorter than 
the depth and fit to the mortise. 
4. If the wheel has a considerable dish, cut off a little of 
the under side of the tenon until the spoke will be in line 
with the other spokes when driven home. 
5. Drive a spoke into the hub until the shoulder of the 
spoke rests on the hub. 
6. Set a steel framing square with the corner against the 
hub band and the longest side extending along one of the 
old spokes. Mark on the blade the location of the shoulder 
and the end of the felloe tenon. : 
7. Transfer these locations to the new spoke and saw off 
the spoke to length. 
8. Point the end of the spoke with a spoke pointer and 
cut the tenon with a hollow auger down to the mark locating 
the shoulder. 
9. Hold the hollow auger level so that the shoulder of the
-P-A-G-E-102

Page No, 2 
tenon will be formed exactly at right angles to the sides of 
the spoke. 
10. If a buggy spoke is to be replaced, first cut off the 
head of the rivet in the hub that holds the old spoke in and 
drive it out with a small punch. Remove the old spoke by 
hammering on the top near the hub and working the end of 
old spoke up and down until it is free. 
11. If the V part of the new spoke tenon is larger than 
the V on the old spoke, dress it to the size of the old spoke 
with a wood rasp. 
12. Put in the spoke and lay it out, and cut the tenon in 
the same manner as in replacing the wagon spoke. 
13. After the tire has been replaced bore or burn out the 
rivet holes and replace the hub rivets. 
Questions: 
1. How is the depth of the mortise in the hub gaged? 
2. What is the result of trying to insert a spoke whose V-shaped tenon 
is larger than the V tenon on the spoke removed? 
3. Why cut the hub tenon shorter than the depth of the mortise? 
4. How are spokes made secure in the hub? 
5. Why should a hollow auger be held in line with the spoke while 
eutting the tenon? 
6. How are the sizes of a hollow auger marked? 
7. How are hollow augers adjusted to size? 
8. Why use a spoke pointer before cutting a tenon? 
9. How may a new spoke be made to conform in the dish to an old 
spoke?

PAINTING REPAIRED PARTS 
Directions: 
1. Be sure that the wood is thoroly dry. 
2. Rub down the surface with No. 1 sandpaper until it is 
smooth and clean. Brush off all dust. 
3. Apply a priming coat of linseed oil in which is mixed 
a little pigment such as red lead or ochre. Two or three 
pounds of pigment to the gallon is sufficient. 
4. If the brush is dry at the beginning saturate it by dip- 
ping it into the paint for about two-thirds of its length and 
wiping out the paint on the edge of the bucket. After the 
brush is saturated dip it into the paint each time, about one- 
third the length of the bristles and before removing from the 
bucket slap it lightly against the sides to remove any excess 
of paint and to properly distribute the paint thru the bristles. 
As the brush is removed from the bucket, point the bristles 
slightly upward. 
5. Hold the brush loosely in the hand with the handle ver- 
tical to the surface being painted. Do not permit the brush 
to drag more than one-third the length of the bristles. Make 
long even strokes in the direction of the grain of the wood 
with the broad side of the brush. Begin in the corners and 
lead with the edge of the brush instead of the broad side. 
When painting in corners place the brush against the surface, 
near the corner, leaning the handle away from the corner 
at an angle of about 45 degrees.. Press on the brush until 
the bristles are bent over about one-third of their length and 
then push the ends of the bristles into the corner. While the 
brush is being pushed into the corner give it a slight shaking 
motion to spread the paint, and then give an outward brush 
stroke. Brush the paint out well and evenly over the entire 
surface. 
6. Allow each coat to become thoroly dry before applying 
the next coat.
-P-A-G-E-104
    
104 Operation No. 41 
Page No. 2 
7. Just before applying the second coat, putty up nail holes 
and other imperfections. White lead mixed with whiting is 
best for this, but ordinary putty mixed with linseed oil will do. 
8. When thru with the job clean the brush thoroly by wash- 
ing it out in turpentine or benzine. If the brush is to be used 
again in the same color of paint it may be kept suspended in a 
ean of water without cleaning out the paint, or it may be left 
in the paint covered with linseed oil. 
Questions: 
1. Why should the wood be thoroly dry before it is painted? 
2. Why should all dust be removed from the surface? 
3. What is the purpose of a priming coat? 
4. What is the purpose of the pigment in the priming coat? 
5. Would white lead made quite thin with oil give a satisfactory prim- 
ing coat?) Why? 
6. What is the effect of dipping the brush too deeply into the paint? 
7. Why point the bristles slightly upward when removing the brush 
from the bucket? 
8. Why should each coat become thoroly dry before applying the next 
coat? 
9. Why should putty never be applied before priming? 
10. Why wash out the brush in turpentine or benzine?

SHARPENING PLOW SHARES 
Directions: 
1. Place the share in the fire, bar down, and the share 
standing straight up. Slip it thru the fire until the end of the 
bar and the point will be heated first. 
2. When the end is up to a bright red heat remove it from 
the fire, place on an anvil bar lying flat and the share stick- 
ing straight up. In this position strike blows on the end of 
the point until it is square. When the point upsets place it 
flat on the anvil and draw it down. Fig. 74.

3. If the plow point is slightly split heat and upset it a 
small amount at the point. Flux the point, replace in the 
fire and raise to a welding heat. Remove it from the fire, 
place it flat on the anvil and weld down smooth. 
4. Continue to hammer alternately on the end and on the 
top until the point is square instead of rounded and a line 
across the point forms slightly less than a right angle with 
the bar side. Hammer or file the top of the point until it is 
tapered abruptly, to a 45 degree angle. The point should 
be turned toward the bar side about 14 inch to 4 inch as a 
“Janding.’? Fig. 75.

anvil. In this position, draw it to a thin cutting edge. As 
the drawing proceeds toward the heel slip the cutting edge 
nearer the edge of the anvil while drawing. Continue until 
the entire cutting edge is drawn out. Give a plow suction by 
inclining the point downward about 14” to 34”. Fig. 77. To 
prevent the cutting edge from flaring at the heel strike it on 
the end before the heel is drawn out. Place it on the surface 
plate or floor plate and level it. From 34” to 114” (depending 
upon the size of the plow) of the outer corner of the share 
should rest on the surface plate for ‘‘bearing.’? The share

and the outer wing of the share. Fig. 78. 
To harden the share draw the cutting edge slowly thru the 
fire until it is to a very low red heat about 14” from the cut 
edge, then plunge, point first, into water. 
If too much heat is in the plow share it will crack or break.

3. Use an old rasp or a piece of old plowshare for repoint- 
ing. Heat the piece to a bright red heat, place on the edge of 
the anvil and forge to approximately the shape and dimen- 
sions shown in Fig. 80. Draw the short sides of the point to a

by the cross-section on the figure. 
4. Build a large, clean fire and have a good supply of coke 
on the forge so that the fire may be replenished as often as 
necessary. 
5. Place the point of the share in the fire, bar down, and 
raise it slowly to a bright red heat. Remove it from the fire 
and flux the bottom of the bar about three or four inches back

from the point and replace it in the fire. Grasp the wide end 
of the point in the tongs and extend the narrow end into the 
fire, being careful to place the point about parallel with the 
bottom of the fire so that the end of the point will not be 
burned off. As soon as the point is to a bright red heat for 
a distance of four inches from the end, remove it from the 
fire and place it flat on the anvil, the thick edge to the right. 
Flux it for about four inches from the end. 
6. Replace it in the fire alongside the share and raise both 
to a welding heat. If the point heats faster than the share 
remove the point until the share catches up. 
7. As soon as both have a white molten appearance have 
the helper remove the share from the fire, strike it on the 
anvil, and very quickly place it on the anvil, the bottom of the 
bar up and the point of the share extending to within about 
an inch of the side of the anvil nearest you. As the helper 
is doing this, remove the point from the fire, strike it on the 
anvil and rest it on the edge of the anvil, the thick edge toward 
the bar side of the share, so that it forms a 45 degree angle 
with the face of the 
anvil and extends above

FITTING HORSE SHOES 
Directions: 
1. If a shoe is to be toe calked, heat it to a bright red 
heat on the toe and strike it on the sides until the heels are 
about an inch apart. Place the shoe flat on the anvil, grooved 
side up, with the sides parallel to the edge of the anvil and 
the toe to the left. Grasp the required kind of toe calk in 
the tongs and place it across the toe of the shoe far enough 
back from the toe so that all the toe calk is on the shoe and 
none extends over the edge of the shoe. Hold the toe calk 
in this position and strike a heavy blow directly over the spur 
on the toe calk. Strike another blow over the spur. Do not 
strike the toe calk more than two heavy blows. 
2. Place the toe of the shoe in the fire with the grooved 
side to the left and the heel inclined about 45 degrees to the 
right. 
3. When heated to a yellow heat remove it and flux with 
borax and flux, and return to the fire. 
4, Just before removing it from the fire to weld, turn the 
shoe over so that the toe calk is on the under side. 
5. Leave it in this position a few seconds, remove from 
the fire, place it flat on the anvil or in the toe swage and weld 
down. 
6. While the toe of the shoe is still hot, open up the nail 
holes in the shoe to the required size with pritchel punching 
from the hoof side of the shoe. 
7. Then open up the nail hole on the groove side of the 
shoe so that the nails can be driven into the groove. 
8. In opening up the nail holes with a pritchel incline the 
top of the pritchel toward the inside of the shoe about ten 
degrees. 
9. Heat the heels of the shoe and bend them out so that 
they are parallel for about two inches from the tips. 
10. Reheat and place on the face of the anvil, the groove

of the shoe down, so that about 114” of the ends stick over 
the edge. 
11. Bend the projecting ends until they form a right angle 
with the rest of the shoe. 
12. Turn the shoe over on the face of the anvil and strike 
a heavy blow on the top of the calks. Direct this blow so that 
the calk will be bent slightly toward the toe calk and also 
toward the outside of the shoe. 
13. Hammer on the top and on the sides of the calks until 
they are the desired height and shape. 
14. Level the shoe by placing it across the face of the anvil, 
calks down, and striking around the shoe where it is to come 
in contact with the foot. 
15. With the shoe on the anvil, groove side up, and the 
heels toward you, place the pritchel in the nail hole on the 
right side and carry the shoe to the horse’s foot. Lay the 
shoe on the bottom of the foot and examine it to see where it 
needs reshaping to make it conform in shape to the white line 
around the foot just inside of the rim. 
16. Make the shoe as wide in the heel as the gait of the 
horse will permit without interfering. 
17. Shape the shoes so that when the nails are driven in 
they will penetrate the horn instead of the sole of the foot.

7. Bend the end of the nail down and twist it off by grasp- 
ing it between the claws of the hammer and giving it a quick 
wrench. 
8. Straighten the shoe on the foot and drive a nail in 
the other side. 
9. Drive in other nails, twisting each one as soon as it is 
driven home, leaving only enough of the nail extending above

neath the end of the nails, being careful not to file the nail. 
13. Turn the clinches with a clinching tool or by holding 
the clinching block under the head and striking the cut end 
of the nail with the edge of the hammer face. 
14. When all the clinches are turned, hammer them down 
flat. 
15. Dress down the hoof with a rasp, being very careful 
not to file off the clinches. 
16. When the projecting edges have been filed off even 
with the shoe run the corner of the rasp around the foot at 
the top of the shoe.

LOCATION OF SHOP EQUIPMENT 
All of the equipment in a blacksmith shop should be ar- 
ranged so that the work to be done can be completed with 
the greatest ease and saving of time. The forge should be 
placed so that it is accessible from all sides and in a position

where light is abundant. The tool rack may be a separate 
piece of equipment or it may be built on the side of the forge. 
The best position for the anvil is about three feet in front of 
the forge, and it should be placed so that the horn is to the 
left and the length of the anvil is at a 45 degree angle to the 
front of the forge. Fig. 88. When placed in this position 
the smith turns thru only 45 degrees in taking the hot iron 
from the forge to the anvil, The slack tub is located at the

be located as near the forge as possible and should be built 
under a window if possible so that there will be an abundance 
of light. Such equipment as the tire-shrinker and drill should 
be placed with the idea of convenience and accessibility in 
mind. 
If the shop is to be a combination iron and woodworking 
shop the iron working equipment should be located at one 
end, and the woodworking equipment, which should always 
include a bench fitted with a woodworking vise, located at the 
other end.

THE FORGE 
In general, there are three types of forges used for heat- 
ing iron and steel. Portable forges used in small repair shops 
and on construction jobs; forges built up of brick or concrete 
used by blacksmiths in smaller shops; cast-iron or sheet steel 
forges used in schools and in large commercial shops. 
The parts common to all forges are the fire-pot and tuyere, 
the body and the hood. Fig. 89. 
  
  Fic. 89. A common type of school forge, using power 
blast and exhaust. 
The fire-pot is a depression in the top of the forge hearth 
and serves to keep the fire from spreading. 
The tuyere is at the bottom of the fire-pot at the terminus 
of the blast pipe and forms a sort of nozzle for distributing
-P-A-G-E-125
  
  Information No. 2 125 
Page No. 2 
the blast. The small openings at the top of the tuyere permit 
the passage of air and at the same time prevent ashes and 
cinders from dropping into the blast pipe. At the bottom of 
the tuyere is a door for cleaning out ashes or cinders. The 
adjustments of the tuyere are controlled by small rods ex- 
tending from the tuyere to the front of the forge. 
The hood of the forge is placed in such a position that it 
will collect the smoke from the fire. 
Air is supplied to the fire in the ordinary blacksmith’s type 
of forge, by means of a bellows or blower operated by hand, 
and.attached to the side of the forge. The amount of blast 
is regulated by the speed of the bellows or fan. In school 
shops and large commercial shops the blast is usually sup- 
plied by a large fan which forces the air thru a system of 
pipes to the forges. The blast that enters the fire is regulated 
by a gate in the blast pipe just under the tuyere. This gate 
is operated by a handle conveniently placed in the front of 
the forge. ! 
The forge with the hand blower probably is best for small 
work and it certainly is best for the beginner. The beginner 
almost invariably uses too much blast and burns his work and 
burns out his fire if he has power blast.

THE ANVIL 
All blacksmith anvils are constructed alike, the only dif- 
ference being the size and the materials from which they are 
made. The cheaper anvils are made entirely of cast-iron with 
chilled faces, but the best anvils are made of wrought-iron or 
of gun metal with tempered tool steel, wear resisting face. 
Anvils range in weight from 75 pounds to 400 pounds. The 
sizes most used range in weight from 150 to 250 pounds. 
Fig. 90. 
The face of the anvil is slightly convex to facilitate the 
drawing of metal. The square hole in the face of the anvil 
near the heel is called the hardy-hole. It is used to hold the 
  Fie. 90 
hardy, the bottom fuller and the bottom swage. The round 
hole is called the pritchel hole and takes its name from the 
punch called the pritchel used by the smith for punching nail 
holes in horseshoes. The small, flat surface between the face 
of the anvil and the horn is called the chipping block and is 
used when it is desired to cut a piece of stock clear thru, and 
there is danger of the sharp edge of the tool coming in con- 
tact with the face of the anvil.’ The surface of the chipping 
block is soft and will not blunt the tool edge if it touches it. 
The horn is used in bending curves and in shaping rings 
and eyes.
-P-A-G-E-127

Page No. 2 
The anvil should be fastened securely to an anvil block. 
This block may be of wood or cast-iron. The wood block is 
preferred by most smiths. If the wood block is used it should 
extend down into the ground about two feet. If the cast-iron 
block is used it should be fastened securely to the floor. The 
block should be just high enough for the knuckles of the smith 
to come even with the top of the anvil as his arm hangs at his 
side. 
The anvil is placed with the horn to the left, as you face 
it, for a right handed man. It should be so placed that the 
smith will face it by making one-third of a turn to the right 
from his position at the forge and it should be close enough 
for him to reach it without taking a step.

THE FORGE FIRE 
There are two kinds of forge fires, namely, oxidizing and 
reducing. 
An oxidizing fire is one to which more air is being supplied 
than is needed for the combustion of the fuel. In such a fire 
the excess of oxygen comes directly in contact with the iron 
or steel being heated, causing very rapid oxidation of the 
metal and, also tending to cool rather than heat. While the 
fire is in this condition welding is impossible, and any sort of 
heating is done with difficulty. 
The characteristics of an oxidizing fire are a very hollow 
appearance with a rim of live coals around the firepot, and a 
very thin layer of coals and cinders over the tuyere. Never 
permit your fire to become an oxidizing one. 
A reducing fire is one that consumes all of the oxygen sup- 
plied by the blast. Such a fire is characterized by having a 
heavy compact bed of live coals over the tuyere banked well 
on three sides with wet, green coal. In a fire of this sort all 
of the oxygen supplied by the blast is utilized to make the 
fire hotter, and there is none to cause excess oxidation or to 
cool the iron or steel being heated. 
Since a reducing fire is one of the most fundamental re- 
quirements for good forging the fire must be watched care- 
fully. As soon as it tends to become hollow or oxidizing it 
should be built up immediately.

FUEL USED FOR FORGE FIRE 
For most work a good quality of smithing coal is used. 
For very large fires coke is used. Charcoal or coke fires 
are sometimes used in working tool steel and in cases where 
an unusually clean, even heat is required. 
Good smithing coal is rather soft and should crumble 
easily in the hand. It should not split into layers and should 
be bright and glossy and show no dull streaks. 
It should coke readily and be relatively free from sulphur 
and other impurities. Good coal will form very little clinker. 
It is quite impossible to do good work with poor coal. 
Smithing coal may be purchased thru coal dealers or hard- 
ware houses. It usually is sold in 100-pound or 200-pound 
bags, but may be purchased by the ton if desired. 
Neither domestic coal nor steaming coal is satisfactory for 
the forge.

Tongs. 
Tongs are classified according to the shape of the jaw as 
flat-jawed, bolt, and pick-up tongs. There are also many 
kinds of tongs with specially constructed jaws used for special

purposes. The flat-jawed tongs are used primarily for han- 
dling flat or square stock, but they are provided with a groove 
down the inside of the jaw to permit the handling of round 
stock also. Bolt tongs are used for handling round stock 
only. Pick-up tongs, as the name implies, are used for 
picking up work and not for holding it while forging.

Hammers. 
Hand hammers are classified according to the shape of the 
peen as cross-peen, straight-peen, and ball-peen or machinists

a blow and the top of it is struck with a sledge by a 
helper. One corner of the face of a set hammer is usually 
rounded so that a slightly rounded corner may be formed. 
Fig. 94. 
Swages. 
Swages are made up of two parts, a block having a semi- 
circular groove across its face and a square shank on the 
other side which fits in the hardy-hole. The other part is 
a hammer-shaped tool with a similar groove in its face and a 
top for striking with a sledge. They come in sizes from 14” 
to 114” and are used for rounding iron 
to its original size that has become dis- 
torted during the process of forging. 
Fig. 95. 
Swage Block. 
The swage block is made of cast- 
iron and weighs about 150 pounds. It 
is about 114 feet square and about six 
or eight inches thick. The edges of the 
swage block are provided with many 
semi-circular grooves so shaped and 
designed to take the place of the bottom 
swage. There are many varied shaped 
holes in the body of the swage block to 
be used for forming depressions in 
sheet-metal, bending iron, ete. Fig. 96. 
Fullers. 
There are two kinds of fullers, top 
Fra. 95 and bottom. The bottom fuller is a 
blunt wedge-shaped block of iron that 
fits into the hardy-hole. The top fuller is a hammer-shaped 
tool with a similar blunt wedge-shaped face and a top for 
striking with a sledge. They come in sizes ranging from 
¥Y,” to 1” and are used in connection with a sledge for form- 
ing grooves or making depressions in stock. Fig. 97.

Hot Cutter. 
The hot cutter is a thin, narrow, hatchet-shaped tool pro- 
vided with a sharply beveled cutting edge and a top for strik- 
ing with a sledge. When made it is usually tempered to refine 
the grain of the steel from which it is made. As its name 
implies, it is used for cutting hot metal. Fig. 98. 
  Fic. 96 Fic. 97 
Cold Cutter. 
The cold cutter is somewhat thicker than the hot cutter 
but of the same width of cutting edge. Its sides are some- 
what bulged to give the additional strength necessary for cut- 
ting cold metal. It is always tempered and ground to a sixty- 
degree cutting edge, and is used in connection with a sledge 
for cutting cold stock. Fig. 99. 
Hardy. 
The hardy is a tool shaped somewhat like the cutters ex- 
cept that it has a square shank which fits into the hardy hole 
in the anvil. It is tempered, ground to a sixty degree cut- 
ting edge and is used to cut both hot and cold stock. Fig. 100.

Punches. 
There are two kinds of punches, namely, handle and hand. 
The handle punch is used in connection with a sledge where 
large holes are to be punched in Jarge stock. The hand punch 
is used for all small holes. The construction of the two kinds 
is similar to the part which functions to produce the hole, 
being ground so that the end is perfectly plane and the edge 
of the end sharp. They are made in special shapes for special 
purposes. Fig. 101.

Bench and Vise. 
The blacksmith bench may be any of a great variety of 
sizes. The space in the shop will generally determine the size 
used. It is usually made large enough to carry a blacksmith’s 
vise near one end, and a good sized drawer for small tools 
near the middle. The bench should be well made of heavy 
material. Fig. 102. 
Sledges. 
There are three standard types of sledges, namely, double- 
faced, straight-peen, and cross-peen. All of these types range 
in weight from eight to twelve pounds, and are provided with 
a handle from 30” to 36” long. Sledges are used to strike tools 
such as top swage, top fuller, and to aid the smith in doing 
heavy drawing. Fig. 103.

IRON AND STEEL 
Cast-Iron. 
Pig-iron is the product of the blast furnace and is the first 
step in the manufacture of cast-iron as well as all grades of 
iron and steel. Castings are made from pig-iron which has 
been remelted in a cupola and to which is sometimes added 
certain kinds of scrap iron to give the finished castings a 
desired quality. Cast-iron contains from 214% to 414% car- 
bon and a small percentage of impurities. It is granular in 
structure and brittle and cannot be forged. This form of iron 
cannot be welded in a forge fire. 
Wrought-Iron. 
Wrought-iron is pig-iron that has had all its carbon re- 
moved. It is fibrous in structure and can be bent to various 
shapes, cold as well as hot. It welds with ease without the 
use of flux. The purest form of wrought-iron is imported from 
Norway and Sweden and is known as Norway or Swedish iron. 
This grade of iron is used for classes of work that involves 
much bending or where a particularly high grade of material 
is required. 
Soft Steel. 
Soft steel is pig-iron that has had approximately all its 
carbon removed. The amount of carbon remaining in the iron 
will vary between the limits of .01 of 1% and .03 of 1%. This 
stock is used by the smith for making all sorts of forgings. 
It may be welded without the use of flux but it welds with 
greater ease when flux is used. 
Tool Steel. 
In the manufacture of tool steel all the carbon is first 
removed from pig iron and then a definite percentage of 
carbon is added. The precentage of carbon added determines 
the grade of steel and the various grades are referred to as
-P-A-G-E-137
  
  Information No. 7 137 
Page No. 2 
being so many point carbon, the point being .01 of 1%. All 
tool steel will fall between the limits of 30 to 150 points. 
Tool steel is of a chemical composition that will permit 
of its being hardened and tempered. Therefore it is used in 
the manufacture of tools. Tools that require toughness com- 
bined with hardness such as cold chisels, hammers, etc., are 
made from tool steel containing from 50 to 75 point carbon. 
Tools such as lathe tools are made from tool steel contain- 
ing from 75 to 100 point carbon. Taps, dies, reamer, etc., are 
made from 100 to 125 point carbon tool steel. Tools that 
require extreme hardness, such as razors, are made from 
tool steel whose carbon content ranges from 125 to 150.

EFFECT OF HEAT ON STEEL 
Tool steel contains a relatively high percentage of carbon 
and is therefore more susceptible to injury by heating than 
wrought-iron or mild steel. The higher the carbon content 
in tool steel, the lower the temperature at which it will burn. 
Tool steel should not be heated above a yellow heat except 
for welding. 
The structure of tool steel is granular as compared with 
the fibrous structure of wrought-iron. As the carbon con- 
tent increases in steel the more granular and brittle it 
becomes. This granular structure will change in its degree 
of coarseness as the temperature rises. It will reach its maxi- 
mum degree of fineness at what is known as the critical 
temperature. The higher the percentage of carbon in tool 
steel, the lower the point at which the critical temperature is 
reached. After the critical temperature is reached further 
heating causes the granular structure to become coarse. 
      
  High carbon tool steel, hardened 
and magnetized 
Fic. 105 
There are two commonly used methods of determining the 
critical temperature of steel which are made use of by the 
blacksmith. The most commonly used method is to heat the 
piece of steel and make several nicks in it about an inch 
apart. Heat the steel thruout the nicked portion so that one 
end will be a yellow heat and the other to a cherry red. 
Plunge the piece quickly until cold. Break the bar at each 
nick and examine the fracture. The fracture that has the 
finest grain was at the critical temperature when cooled. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-139
  
  Information No. 8 139 
Page No. 2 
color of the steel at this point is the color at which that 
particular grade of steel should be heated when hardening. 
When tool steel reaches the critical temperature it is non- 
magnetic. This phenomenon forms the basis for the most 
accurate method of determining the critical temperature. 
While the temperature is being raised hold occasionally the 
end of a balanced bar magnet just over the part being heated. 
Just as soon as the end of the magnet is not attracted to the 
steel the critical temperature has been reached and the steel 
should be removed from the fire and plunged. Fig. 105.

140 Information No. 9 
WELDING 
Welding is the most difficult of all the forging operations. 
It is accomplished by heating the metal until it is in a semi- 
molten or pasty condition, quickly placing the pieces in contact 
and hammering them until they are firmly united. 
Wrought-iron and steel up to 50 point carbon can be welded 
readily, but the higher carbon steels and cast-iron can not 
be welded in the forge fire. 
When a piece of iron or steel is heated even in a reducing 
fire more or less air will come in contact with it. The oxygen 
of the air will combine with the iron forming oxide of iron 
which will appear in the form of a scale on the metal. This 
oxide of iron has a higher melting point than the metal and 
if the structure of the metal will not permit of the tempera- 
ture required to melt the scale, a flux must be used to pre- 
vent the formation of the scale, or, in the event of its having 
already formed, cause it to melt at a lower temperature. In 
general, steel will not permit of a temperature sufficiently 
high to melt the scale. It is therefore necessary to use a flux 
in welding materials of this sort. 
The range of the welding temperature is very narrow. 
The higher the percentage of carbon the shorter the range 
of welding temperatures. If the metal is heated to too high 
a temperature it will burn. Burning is indicated by a bright 
shower of exploding sparks coming from the fire. Burned iron 
is characterized by its rough pitted appearance. It is also 
crumbly and brittle. 
The following are fundamental conditions for a good 
weld: 
(1) The fire must be a perfectly clean reducing fire and 
should be built to accommodate the pieces being welded. 
(2) The smith must know what he is going to do and 
exactly how he is going to do it before the heat is taken. 
Everything should be in readiness so that the weld can be
-P-A-G-E-141
  
Information No. 9 141 
Page No. 2 
completed with the minimum loss of time after the heat is 
taken. 
(3) The scarf must be so prepared that there is a good 
contact between the pieces, and thin edges should be avoided.

142 Information No. 10 
FLUXES 
The principal functions of flux as used in welding are to 
prevent the formation of scale or oxide of iron on steel and 
to cause that which has already formed to melt at a lower 
heat. It is not in any sense a cement. Before two pieces of 
stock will unite, the oxide of iron must melt. In wrought-iron 
and soft steel the heat can be raised sufficiently to melt the 
scale without injury to the metal but in high quality soft steel 
and all tool steel the temperature required to melt the scale 
will injure the material. The higher the percentage of carbon 
in steel the more susceptible it is to injury by heat, so it is 
absolutely necessary in making any sort of weld in steel to 
use flux. Flux is also used as a covering for small or delicate 
work to prevent oxidation when the work must be reheated 
a number of times. Clean sand and borax are commonly used 
for flux. When mixed in the proportion of half and half they 
make a flux that will suffice for all ordinary welding. Pre- 
pared fluxes are much more expensive than a borax-sand flux 
but they are used by practically all blacksmiths. The quantity 
of flux required for a weld is so small that the cost is negligible.

TEMPERING TOOL STEEL 
When a piece of tool steel is heated to its critical tempera- 
ture and is suddenly plunged into a cooling bath it becomes 
exceedingly hard and brittle. A tool having this extreme 
brittleness is not fit for use, but if it is heated up slowly the 
hardness will be drawn. The hardness may be reduced until 
it will conform to any requirement of the tool. 
This process of reducing the hardness or brittleness of 
tools is called tempering. The particular degree of hardness 
at any time during the tempering process is indicated on the 
surface of the tool by what is known as temper colors. 
When the tool is heated to the critical temperature, plunged 
and polished, it will assume a pearly gray color. When this 
gray hardened surface is slowly heated, its color will change 
to a light straw. If the heating is continued, its color will 
change as follows: light straw, dark straw, brownish purple, 
purplish blue, and blue. Each of these colors represents a 
different degree of hardness of the steel. Knowing the re- 
quirements of the tool, the smith is able to reduce the hard- 
ness to any point by watching the colors, then plunging tha 
tool to fix the degree of hardness.

SHAPES AND SIZES OF WROUGHT-IRON, MILD 
STEEL, AND TOOL STEEL USED BY 
BLACKSMITHS 
The shapes into which wrought-iron and mild steel are 
rolled for forge purposes are divided into three groups, 
namely, bar, strap, and sheet iron. 
Bar iron is round, square, rectangular, half round, oval,

CASE-HARDENING 
Case-hardening consists essentially in converting the ex- 
terior or case of a piece of wrought-iron or soft steel into 
high-carbon tool steel without changing the character of the 
internal structure. The process consists in surrounding the 
pieces with some highly carbonaceous substance such as bone 
meal, charred leather scrap, or potassium cyanide and hold- 
ing it to a high temperature for a period of time. The thick- 
ness of-the coat required will determine the length of time 
the pieces must be left in the compound. Pieces are usually 
left in bone meal for several hours or even days. In potas- 
sium cyanide, however, the required thickness may be 
obtained in from thirty minutes to an hour and one-half. The 
metal absorbs carbon from the material surrounding it thus 
converting it into high carbon steel. After case-hardening, 
the surface has all of the characteristics of tool steel and may 
be plunged and hardened. 
By case-hardening we get a product that has a hard wear- 
resisting surface or case combined with a tough soft steel 
center. This is often highly desirable in manufacturing cer- 
tain parts for machines. The wrist pin in a gas engine will 
illustrate the point. A wrist pin must have a wear-resisting 
outer shell, but it need not be hard all the way thru. In 
fact, if the pin were hardened all the way thru it would be 
highly susceptible to crystallization. A case-hardened, soft- 
steel pin is very resilient and will absorb the shock or force 
of the explosion without the danger of crystallization. 
Potassium cyanide is generally used for case-hardening. 
It is a highly poisonous chemical and must be handled with 
great care. It should not be allowed to come in contact with 
scratches or open wounds, nor should the fumes be inhaled.

TAPS AND DIES 
There are two types of threads in general use. 
(1) The U.S. 8S. (United States Standard) is in common 
use in machinery and for most other purposes except where 
the thread is in soft metal. 
(2) The S. A. E. (Society of Automotive Engineers) has 
a finer pitch to the thread and is used where fine adjustments 
and great security is needed. It is the standard thread used 
in automobile construction. 
A complete set of taps consists of three taps for each 
size: 
(1) The taper tap, which is tapered to a long taper so 
that the end is smaller than the drill hole in which the threads 
are to be cut. This makes it easy to start the tap properly. 
The taper tap is generally used where the hole goes thru the 
stock and no other tap is necessary. 
(2) The plug tap is only slightly tapered and is used to 
start the thread in blind holes. 
(3) The bottoming tap is used to follow the plug tap to eut 
a thread to the bottom of a blind hole. 
Dies are either solid or adjustable. The solid dies usually 
are made 1/32” oversize for rough work. The adjustable die 
may be adjusted to cut over or under. It should never be 
used without first examining it to see that it is properly 
adjusted. 
Taps and dies are easily damaged by careless handling. 
They should be kept oiled with a light oil and kept in a box 
where they will not come in contact with other tools or with 
each other.

EXPANSION OF IRON AND STEEL 
When iron and steel are heated they expand, when cooled 
they contract. When work is being done that requires great 
accuracy the expansion of the metal must be taken into con- 
sideration. Expansion is made use of in doing such work as 
shrinking tires, shrinking bands, etc. The rate of expansion 
is uniform as the temperature rises. The expansion of a 
piece of iron or steel when the temperature is raised from 
room temperature to a cherry red heat is approximately one- 
tenth of an inch per foot. When heated to a bright red heat 
the expansion is approximately one-eighth inch per foot. By 
means of these figures the amount of the expansion of a tire 
or band may be readily calculated by first finding the length 
of the tire or band in feet and then multiplying by the amount 
of expansion per foot.

FILES 
There are three classes of files; namely, rasp cut, single- 
cut and double-cut. Under each of the above classes we have 
four grades or degrees of coarseness ; namely, coarse, bastard, 
second-cut, and smooth. There are many shapes of files, but 
the most common shapes are rectangular or flat, triangular or 
three-cornered, half round, round or rat tail, and square. The 
ordinary flat file is used by the blacksmith for all general pur- 
poses, but such jobs as saw sharpening require a special kind 
of file. Sometimes a flat file is provided with one smooth edge 
or safe edge so that the filing may be done in a corner without 
cutting the side of the corner.

EMERY WHEEL TEST FOR DETERMINING KINDS 
OF MATERIALS 
The most common method of differentiating between the 
different grades of tool steel, soft steel and iron is the emery 
wheel test. It consists in placing the stock against the emery 
wheel and observing the shower of sparks that come off the 
wheel while the stock is being ground. Hach kind of material 
will give off sparks distinctly different in appearance. High- 
carbon tool steel gives off a shower of very light red sparks 
which explode into many star-like shoots. As the percentage 
of carbon in the material decreases, the sparks become redder 
and the explosions into star-like particles are fewer. Norway 
iron has a red spark with no star-like explosions. 
The carbon content of material may be determined by 
comparing the sparks with the sparks of material with a 
known percentage of carbon. Files are known to contain a 
relatively high percentage of carbon, say about one-hundred 
point, and if touched to the emery wheel and ground, a light 
colored shower of sparks with numerous star-like explosions 
will come off the wheel. Since a file is always available it 
will be convenient to use this as a basis for comparison. If 
there are more star-like explosions the material being tested 
contains more carbon than the file. The more the shower 
tends toward a red non-explosive spark the smaller the per- 
centage of carbon contained. In order to form a basis for 
judgment test several pieces by comparing the sparks with 
those of file.

  INTRODUCTION 
ProFEssIoNnAL training requires the application of theory to practice. 
No professional student is qualified for his life work until he has 
command of the techniques employed by successful practitioners in 
his profession. In ever increasing degree professional schools are 
offering the opportunity for the solution of genuine problems and 
for practice which will develop skill. The engineering student 
works in the factory, on the railroad, or irrigation project, or in 
some other industrial enterprise as a regular part of his training. 
The medical student applies the theories that he has learned in 
classroom and laboratory in his interneship in the hospital. The 
student of law acquires ability in his profession by the study of the 
case presented for his consideration in the light of the decisions of 
the courts. Business executives are trained through the considera- 
tion of the problems of plant organization, personnel management, 
marketing and finance. In like manner, training for the profession 
of school administration requires that we provide opportunities for 
the consideration of the varied problems of the superintendent of 
schools. 
For the past five years the courses for the training of school 
executives in Teachers College, Columbia University, have been 
developed upon a problem basis. In each of these years students 
have attacked the problems confronting school systems of various 
sizes and types through surveys which have been directed by mem- 
bers of the staff. Special techniques and skills required of the 
superintendent of schools have been developed in the laboratory. 
A great variety of problems occurring in the experience of these 
executives has been the subject of discussion in the classroom. 
This book brings together a collection of problems which school 
executives have had to solve. Some of them have been discovered 
in the course of surveys that have been conducted by the staff of 
Teachers College. Some of them have been recorded by experienced 
administrators who have asked for advice or who have been mem- 
bers of an advanced group of students in training. » Those that are 
included have seemed to be of sufficient importance to be published 
for the use of students in Teachers College. All of them are sub- 
mitted for criticism to the profession.

  vi INTRODUCTION 
problems recognize the necessity of making a further analysis of 
the work of the superintendent of schools. It will be necessary to 
collect many more problems than are included in this volume before 
we may claim to have provided any complete treatment of the 
field of administration. There has been no attempt in this volume 
to indicate the relative emphasis which should be placed upon the 
different aspects of the superintendent’s work, either through the 
number of problems included or by the elaboration of the admin- 
istrative situation provided in the statement of any one problem. 
About half of the problems included have been tried out in our 
courses. The others have only recently been put into form and are 
yet to be tested with our students. It seems entirely probable that 
out of the experience which will follow this publication we may de- 
cide to change the form of some of the problems and to omit others 
in later publications. 
The job analysis and problem attack as a method of teaching 
is not intended to substitute debate for knowledge of the field. 
Throughout this book the student is referred to sources of in- 
formation available in published articles, monographs, surveys, and 
the like. Nothing could be more fallacious than to propose that 
students debate the issues of administration without command 
of all of the scientific knowledge available. The advantage of the 
problem attack is to be found in the organization of the scientific 
knowledge available with particular reference to professional prob- 
lems which the superintendent of schools will have to solve. It 
seems reasonable to propose that as a result of this type of organiza- 
tion the student will command the knowledge available more 
thoroughly than he would were he merely asked to read books or 
to report on scientific investigations. 
The solving of problems cannot take the place of the work which 
should be done in the laboratory or of the experience which can 
be gained in field work under systematic supervision. In order to 
learn to represent graphically the facts with which the superin- 
tendent of schools deals the student will have to practice the draw- 
ing of graphs and submit them for criticism. If the intending 
superintendent of schools is to become acquainted with the adapt- 
ability of calculating machines for the work of his office, he must 
have these demonstrated for him, and still more important, he 
should practice upon them. To become thoroughly acquainted 
with modern practice in filing the student needs laboratory ex- 
perience. Familiarity with photometer, the sling psychometer, the 
projecting lantern, or the moving picture machine is necessary for 
one who is to use these instruments, or to know of their availability

  for use by his staff. A thorough understanding of accounting will 
require that the student spend hours of work in the laboratory mak- 
ing entries and checking up on the accounts which he has developed. 
Familiarity with the reading of plans and specifications in the 
laboratory will furnish the only sound basis for the criticism which 
a superintendent of schools should be able to present to the architect 
or to his board of education. It would not be possible to print in 
any book all of the forms of records and reports with which the 
student should be familiar in order that he may choose wisely in 
the development of the records to be kept in his school system. 
In like manner, many problems occur in the survey of school 
systems which demand the application of the scientific knowledge 
which the student has come to command in the solution of the 
problems which have been discussed in class. Each community 
has its peculiar problems of organization and administration. What 
is the relation of the school administration to the general municipal, 
county or other local administration? What modifications in the 
school organization promise to add to the efficiency of the service? 
Which type of organization will make for economy? ‘These are 
among the problems which recur in every field study. 
The local issues having to do with taxation and finance with 
which the student has come in contact in a school survey will 
bring to his attention scores of problems which are identical with 
those with which he must deal later in his work. Variations which 
occur in the business administration of schools, the purchasing, 
storage and distribution of supplies, the maintenance and opera- 
tion of buildings, budgetary procedure, attendance service, school 
health administration, the organization of the administrative and 
supervisory staff, and the like, will contribute most significantly to 
the more complete understanding of the problems which the 
superintendent of schools has to meet. 
And so for practically every other administrative problem, 
whether it has to do with forecasting the need for new school ac- 
commodations, the management of personnel, the classification and 
progress of children, the development of more adequate curricula 
and courses of study, the supervision of instruction or the relation 
of the school to the community, all become intensely practical 
problems in the situation which requires the student to do his best 
to find the solution which is to be proposed and even more import- 
ant to be carried out by the local school system. Practice in field 
work is the logical next step after the student has gained consider- 
able command of the field through the solution of problems in the 
classroom.
-P-A-G-E-6
  viii INTRODUCTION 
For those who have demonstrated their competence in the solution 
of problems and in field work opportunity is provided in Teachers 
College to undertake investigation which will result in the im- 
provement of professional practice. The emphasis in these re- 
searches is upon the problems of the superintendents of schools. 
There is a sharp distinction between the type of investigation which 
is entirely justified in the field of pure science and that which should 
characterize the advanced work of the professional school. Cer- 
tainly research is not less worthy because it is devoted to the solu- 
tion of problems which confront the professional worker. It is 
most worthwhile to inquire concerning the techniques to be 
employed in the development of a school building program, the way 
to secure more adequate janitorial service, the most efficient 
organization of a department of census and attendance, the most 
equitable method of distributing state support, the necessary 
budgetary provision to be made for the equipment of new buildings, 
or the most efficient method of acquainting the people with the work 
of the school system. Indeed, it may be proposed that there is no 
detail of the work of the administrator that may not properly be- 
come the subject of intensive investigation by those who are candi- 
dates for the doctor’s degree in the professional school. 
It is of the utmost importance that the highly technical work of 
the specialized courses be paralleled with other training in the 
theory and practice of education. No one would seriously propose 
that a man was fit to be a superintendent of schools unless he was 
well grounded in the philosophy of education. Many of the ad- 
ministrative problems which he will have to meet will require 
a knowledge of the principles and of the results of investigations in 
the field of psychology and sociology. The success of the superin- 
tendent of schools will often be determined by his knowledge in 
the fields of public finance and municipal administration. Much 
light would be thrown upon many of the problems with which the 
superintendent has to deal by courses in comparative education. 
In addition to his study in these fundamental fields which furnish 
the background for the technical courses the superintendent of 
schools should have contact with other professional work in the 
school of education. The more he can learn with respect to the 
subject matter and method of instruction, the more certainly he is 
acquainted with the detail of the work of principal or supervisor, 
the better qualified he will be for the general administrative posi- 
tion. The ideal situation would be one in which those seeking to 
qualify for the position of superintendent of schools would have 
brought to their attention the work of all of these specialists in 
 
-P-A-G-E-7
  INTRODUCTION ix 
relation to the particular problems which the superintendent of 
schools has to solve. If the technical course is dealing with the 
problem of equipping the elementary school building, the specialists 
in kindergarten and primary education, in household arts, in in- 
dustrial arts, in library maintenance and operation, in physical edu- 
cation and health service, in music and art, should be called into 
conference and should propose and defend the recommendations 
with respect to specialized equipment. In like manner, if the issue 
before the superintendents’ group is that of curricula, subject matter 
specialists and supervisors responsible for the teachers’ growth 
should play a large part in the solution of the problems presented 
in the professional course. 
It is important that the courses in psychology, the history and 
philosophy of education, in taxation and finance and municipal ad- 
ministration be presented from the point of view of the ad- 
ministrator. The examination of any one of these fields will make 
apparent the validity of this contention. It is not just psychology 
that the superintendent of schools needs, but rather the application 
of the principles of psychology and of the investigations that have 
been made to the problems of the organization of schools, the classi- 
fication of pupils, and the validity of methods of instruction. In 
the history of education the administrator needs most of all a dis- 
cussion of the practices which have prevailed in the past and 
particularly those which have been developed in his own field, rather 
than a consideration of historical theories. 
But the principal emphasis in professional courses for the train- 
ing of superintendents of schools must be upon the analysis of 
the work to be done, and the development of the techniques es- 
sential to the adequate solution of the problems the administrator 
must solve. The more certainly the student deals with genuine 
problems during his period of training, the more likely he will be 
to meet with success in the field. Knowledge of the facts of edu- 
cational administration cannot be substituted for practice in ap- 
plying these facts to the solution of administrative problems. It is 
just as certainly possible to provide definite professional training 
for the superintendent of schools as it is for the doctor, lawyer, or 
engineer. With the development of these professional courses we 
may confidently expect an increase in the efficiency of workers in 
this most important branch of the public service.

PROBLEM 1 
STATE ADMINISTRATION 
Problem: It is proposed to deny the New York State Commis- 
sioner of Education the right to exercise certain general admin- 
istrative and judicial powers now vested in him by law. These 
judicial powers include the right to render final judgment upon 
issues affecting teachers and boards of education, and the con- 
solidation of schools. 
It is proposed to base the change upon the plea of giving 
to teachers the same right of appeals to courts of law as other 
citizens enjoy in other than school matters. 
THE PERTINENT NEW YORK EDUCATION LAW (1923 EDITION) 
1. The Administrative Powers of the Commissioner. 
Art. 4. 
Section 94. General Powers and Duties. The Commissioner of 
Education is hereby charged with the following powers and duties: 
1. He is the chief executive officer of the state system of educa- 
tion and of the Board of Regents. He shall enforce all general and 
special laws relating to the educational system of the state and 
execute all educational policies determined upon by the Board of 
Regents. 
2. He shall have general supervision over all schools and in- 
stitutions which are subject to the provisions of this act, or of any 
statute relating to education, and shall cause the same to be 
examined and inspected, and shall advise and guide the school 
officers of all districts and cities of the state in relation to their 
duties and the general management of the schools under their 
control. 
7. He may annul upon cause shown to his satisfaction any 
certificate of qualification granted to a teacher by any authority 
whatever or declare any diploma issued by a state normal school 
ineffective and null as a qualification to teach a common school 
within this State, and he may reconsider and reverse his action in 
any such matter

Section 96. Other Powers. The Commissioner of Education shall 
also have power and it shall be his duty to cause to be instituted 
such proceedings or processes as may be necessary to properly en- 
force and give effect to any provision in this chapter or in any 
other general or special law pertaining to the school system of the 
state or any part thereof or to any school district or city. He shall 
possess the power and authority to likewise enforce any rule or 
direction of the Regents. 
2. Judicial Powers of the Commissioner. 
Art. 3. 
Section 46. Legislative Power. (Of the Regents). Subject and 
in conformity to the constitution and laws of the state, the Regents 
shall exercise legislative functions concerning the educational system 
of the state, determine its educational policies, and except as to the 
judicial functions of the Commissioner of Education, establish rules 
for carrying into effect the laws and policies of the state, relating to 
education, and the powers, duties and trusts conferred or charged 
upon the University. ... 
Art. 34, 
Section 890 Appeals or Petitions to Commissioner of Education 
and Other Proceedings. Any person conceiving himself aggrieved 
may appeal or petition to the Commissioner of Education who is 
hereby authorized and required to examine and decide the same; 
and the Commissioner of Education may also institute such pro- 
ceedings as are authorized under this act and his decision in such 
appeals, petitions or proceedings shall be final and conclusive, and 
not subject to question or review in any place or court whatever. 
Such appeal or petition may be made in consequence of any action: 
1. By any school district meeting; 
2. By any school commissioner and other officers, in forming or 
altering, or refusing to form or alter, any school district, or in refus- 
ing to apportion any school moneys to any such district or part of a 
district; 
8. By a supervisor in refusing to pay any such moneys to any 
such district; 
4. By the trustees of any district in paying or refusing to pay any 
teacher, or in refusing to admit any scholar gratuitously into any 
school or on any other matter upon which they may or do officially 
act; 
5. By any trustees of any school library concerning such library, 
or the books therein, or the use of such books;

Section 891. Powers of Commissioner upon Appeals or Petitions, 
et cetera. The Commissioner, in reference to such appeals, petitions 
or proceedings, shall have power: 
1. To regulate the practice therein. 
2. To determine whether an appeal shall stay proceedings, and 
prescribe conditions upon which it shall or shall not so operate. 
8. To decline to entertain or to dismiss an appeal, when it shall 
appear that the appellant has no interest in the matter appealed 
from, and that the matter is not a matter of public concern, and 
that the person injuriously affected by the act or decision appealed 
from is incompetent to appeal. 
4. To make all orders, by directing the levying of taxes or other- 
wise, which may, in his judgment, be proper or necessary to give 
effect to his decision. (Section renumbered by L. 1918, ch. 252.) 
THE GENERAL STATE LAW INVOKED IN THE PROPOSAL 
It is impossible to give the general law on which the contention 
will be made until legal processes are started. In all probability, 
the following will be cited: 
Const. Art. 1, Sect. 2. 
The trial by jury in all cases in which it has been heretofore 
used shall remain inviolate forever; but a jury trial may be waived 
by the parties in all civil cases in the manner to be prescribed 
by law. 
[Notes: Several cases give decisions extending this right to new 
and like cases as afterward may arise. 
Jury trial can be demanded as a matter of right under this 
section only in proceedings that are judicial in nature. People v. 
Smith (1860) 21 N. Y. 595; Livingston v. New York (1831) 8 
Wend. 85.] 
In support of the present judicial power of the Commissioner, 
the following may be cited from the general law: 
1. When a controversy has been submitted to the Commissioner 
of Education for his determination, jury trial has been waived. 
People v. Eckler (1880) 19 Hun. 609. 
2. Jury trial can be demanded as a matter of right under the 
educational law only in proceedings that are judicial in nature. 
People v. Smith (1860) N. Y. 595; Livingston v. New York 
(1831) 8 Wend. 85.

3. Exclusiveness of remedy by appeal to Commissioner has been 
determined by numerous cases. Decisions specify such as fol- 
lowing: Failure to appoint teachers; Refusal to pay teachers’ 
salary; Removal of teacher; Determination of qualifications of 
teachers; Seizure of property for non-payment of tax; Failure 
of Commissioner to pay over school moneys; Error in apportion- 
ing tax; Condemnation of property for school purposes. 
4, The Legislature has constitutional power to provide for the com- 
missioner’s judicial power. People v. Skinner (1902) 74 App. 
Div. 58, 77 N. Y. 8. 36. 
5. The Education Law contemplates that such disputes as arise in 
the administration of the great school system “should be passed 
upon and determined, at least so far as possible, by that de- 
partment of the State upon which falls the burden and the 
responsibility of its proper and lawful administration.” People 
v. Draper (1912) 78 Misc. 329, 188 N. Y.S. 351. 
6. The Legislature intended to place full responsibility for this on 
the Commissioner of Education, Matter of O’Neill (1911) Misc. 
469, 130 N. Y. S. 446.

If you were a member of the teaching profession in the State 
of New York, how would you hope to meet this attack upon 
the professional status of the Commissioner of Education?

PROBLEM 2 
THE LEGAL BASIS OF A SCHOOL SYSTEM 
Problem: To determine what method of selecting board of 
education members will best serve the city under consideration, 
and the degree of fiscal independence that should be accorded 
that board. 
The city of Millertown,' 30,000 population, is governed by a 
charter which was enacted by the 1923 session of the New 
York Legislature. Section 117 of this document provides that 
on or before the first day of July in each year, the board of 
education shall submit to the council an estimate for the en- 
suing year of the amount necessary under the provisions of the 
law for the expense of the schools and such other matters as 
may come under the supervision of the board, “after crediting 
thereto the estimated balance which may remain in the school 
budget at the close of its fiscal year and the amount anticipated 
in the next apportionment of school funds from the state and 
the estimated amount to be received from all other sources.” 
The council may either ratify the amount so certified or modify 
any item. In the latter event, the city clerk must certify such 
modification to the president of the board of education. The 
charter then provides, “The board of education shall have 
power by the vote of two-thirds of all members thereof . . . to 
declare by resolution that. the estimated amount so submitted 
to the council, or a less sum, in either case is necessary for the 
conduct of the schools for the ensuing year which amounts so 
finally determined by the board of education shall not exceed 
the sum of forty-two dollars for the school year commencing 
September first, nineteen-hundred and twenty-three, and each 
year thereafter for each pupil enrolled in the public schools 
+In many of the problems fictitious names are used for the cities and for 
the states in which the issue presented for the consideration of the student 
was actually located. It is believéd that this will contribute to the objective 
consideration of the problem.

8 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
during the preceding year or such further amount per enrolled 
pupil as the council may fix by resolution or ordinance.” 
This charter provides further that the amount of the school 
budget so certified shall be raised by taxation in the same man- 
ner as other city tax money. Section 127 directs the city treas- 
urer to place to the credit of the board of education all school 
taxes collected on the levy for school purposes except such as 
may have been advanced in anticipation of the school levy. 
All uncollected amounts of the school tax are to be credited on 
October 1 of each year to the board of education account, thus 
compelling the city to bear the loss incurred by reason of un- 
collected school taxes. 
The city is authorized to issue bonds, warrants or city ac- 
ceptances for certain specified purposes, among those enumer- 
ated appearing the meeting of a deficiency in the school 
budget. The city council also issues school bonds after au- 
thorization by the legally qualified electors, and provides for 
the payment of the interest on same and the retirement of the 
principal. The city treasury also benefits through any prem- 
ium that may be secured through the selling of school bonds. 
The New York School Code, Edition of 1928, provides in 
Section 865 for a board of nine members for a city of the type 
of Millertown. Section 866-1 defines eligibility for board mem- 
bership as United States citizenship, together with three years’ 
residence in the city for which he is chosen. Section 866-4-b 
provides that in a third-class city in which the members of the 
board of education are not elected at an annual election, the 
common council may by a majority vote submit to the voters 
at large in such city at any general election or municipal elec- 
tion, the question whether members of the board shall there- 
after be so elected. If, at such an election, a majority vote 
affirmatively, the provisions of the law are to be carried out in 
this respect. Section 866-5 provides for appointment by the 
mayor in “all other cities” with no mention of confirmation by 
the council except in a situation not applicable to Millertown. 
Inasmuch as the School Law passed in 1917 permitted the 
charter provision relating to the appointment of school board 
members then in effect to stand, Millertown has a board of 
education appointed by the mayor for five-year terms without 
confirmation by the council.

  NATIONAL AND STATE RESPONSIBILITY 9 
The powers of the board of education are defined in Section 
868 and the powers of the superintendent of schools in Section 
870, School Laws of 1923. These have the force of making the 
board of education and the superintendent of schools inde- 
pendent of the common council except in matters of finance. 
Section 877-1 provides for an annual itemized estimate of 
funds needed for the current fiscal year after crediting thereto 
the amounts to be realized from all other sources. Section 
877-3, which is applicable to the Millertown situation, reads: 
In a city of the third class in which the common council, under 
the statutes in effect prior to the time when this act takes effect, 
has the power to determine the amount of funds which will be in- 
cluded in the estimate for the support and maintenance of the 
public schools, . . . such common council . . . shall have the same 
power and shall perform the same duties as are required under the 
statutes in effect prior to the taking effect of this act, and the 
provisions of such statutes shall continue in force and effect not- 
withstanding the provisions of this act. Nothing in this act shall 
be construed as conferring upon the common council of a city of the 
third class the power to determine the amount which shall be used 
for school purposes which was not specifically conferred upon the 
common council of such city under the statutes in effect prior to 
the taking effect of this act. [The act was effective June 8, 1917.] 
The 1897 charter of the city of Millertown, as amended by 
various sessions of the New York legislature, was in effect at 
that time in the city of Millertown. Section 91 of that instru- 
ment had the following provisions: 
The board of education ... shall submit in writing to the 
common council an estimate of the expenses of said board for the 
ensuing year.... [Then follows an enumeration of the larger 
items to be covered by that estimate.] 
Section 92 of the 1906 amended charter contains the follow- 
ing provision which was not unlike the provision in effect in 
1917 except for the amounts per enrolled pupil which were 
revised by the legislature from time to time: 
In case the common council shall ratify the estimates of expen- 
ditures so submitted, the amount of such estimates shall constitute 
the sum to be raised for the board of education by taxation for the 
ensuing year; the common council may modify any items of the 
estimates for expenditures so submitted, and in such case it shall be 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
  10 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
the duty of the city clerk to so certify to the president of the board 
of education such modification; the board of education shall have 
power by vote of two-thirds of the members thereof, at any regular 
or special meeting called for that purpose . . . to declare by resolu- 
tion that the estimated amounts as submitted to the common 
council, or a less sum, are necessary for the conduct of the schools 
for the ensuing year, which amount so finally determined by the 
board of education shall not exceed the sum of twenty dollars for 
each pupil enrolled in the public schools during the preceding year, 
and it shall be the duty of the city clerk to forthwith certify such 
resolution to the president of the common council, in which case 
it shall be the duty of the common council to raise the amounts so 
determined for the purposes of the public schools, in the tax levy 
for the following year. 
Later a portion of this section was amended to read: 
The board of education shall have power by the vote of two- 
thirds of all members thereof, at any regular or special meeting 
called for that purpose within one week from the date of the receipt 
of the certification of the city clerk by the president of the board 
of education, to declare by resolution that the estimated amounts as 
submitted to the common council, or a less sum, in each case are 
necessary for the conduct of the schools for the ensuing year which 
amounts so finally determined by the board of education shall not 
exceed the sum of twenty-one dollars for the financial year of nine- 
teen-hundred and fourteen; twenty-two dollars for the year nine- 
teen-hundred and fifteen; twenty-three dollars for the year nineteen- 
hundred and sixteen; twenty-four dollars for the year nineteen-hun- 
dred and seventeen; and twenty-five dollars for the year nineteen- 
hundred and eighteen and each year thereafter for each pupil en- 
rolled in the public school during the preceding year, of which 
amount, the difference between nineteen dollars and the maximum 
allowance for each pupil enrolled as given above may be raised in 
excess of the one dollar and seventy cents on every one hundred 
dollars of the assessed valuation of the taxable property of the 
city as provided ... in the city charter. 
The amount per pupil enrolled was changed twice by the 
legislature until thirty-five dollars per enrolled pupil was 
reached for 1923 when the new charter was granted by the 
legislature with the provision noted in the first paragraph. In 
the later revisions, reference to the excess over a certain limit 
noted above was omitted. 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
  NATIONAL AND STATE RESPONSIBILITY 11 
The intent of the provisions cited above was clearly to make 
the board fiscally dependent. The new charter is perhaps a 
little more flexible in that it implies that the city council may 
fix an amount in excess of the forty-two dollar limit imposed 
by the 1923 charter. It is worthy of notice that under date of 
November 8, 1922, the State Attorney General held in a letter 
addressed to the city attorney who is also attorney for the 
board of education that the General Education Laws of 1917 
removed the charter restriction and made the board fiscally 
independent. Notwithstanding this letter, which is of course 
but an opinion, the board has continued to be dependent upon 
the common council for funds, and the common council has 
cut the budget of the board repeatedly. The acute nature of 
the feeling toward this situation is evidenced by the repeated 
mention of such dependence in the Millertown Sun as found 
through a checking of its files for a period of five years. 
In view of the many charter amendments and the General 
Education Law of 1917, with its subsequent revisions and the 
newly enacted city charter, it would probably be necessary to 
have a decision of the supreme court of the state to determine 
definitely whether the board is fiscally independent or depend- 
ent. Were such a decision to favor fiscal independence, there 
still remains the question of the board dependent upon the 
mayor for appointment without the approval of the common 
council. 
It is well to bear in mind that when Millertown received its 
first charter in 1867, the schools were governed by a board of 
education elected by the people under the provisions of a law 
enacted in 1865. This board was fiscally independent so far 
as the city council was concerned but limited by certain statu- _ 
tory provisions setting the maximum amounts that could be 
raised for the various purposes enumerated in the law. The 
charter of 1897 also provided for a board to be elected by the 
people, this plan remaining in effect until 1910 when the board 
was changed to an appointive one, the mayor having the power 
of appointment with the approval of a majority of the common 
council. These facts are set forth to show that Millertown has 
had in the past an elective board of education as well as one 
with fiscal independence. 
It is interesting to note further that the press reports in-
-P-A-G-E-28
  12 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
dicate that the method of selecting board members at an elec- 
tion was changed to one of appointment by the mayor largely 
because few electors participated in the election for board 
members which was held at a different time from the general or 
municipal elections. 
Assignment 
1. Should the city have a board elected by the citizens of 
the school district? 
2. If the board is to be elected, what recommendation should 
be made relative to changing from the present method of ap- 
pointment to the method of election by the people? 
8. Should fiscal independence be accorded the board as now 
selected? If not, what limits should be set? 
4, If the city changes to an elective board, should that board 
be fiscally independent or should its budget be reviewed by 
somebody having similar power in connection over every other 
city board?

  PROBLEM 3 
STATE CONTROL OF EDUCATION 
Problem: A revision of the state constitution has been planned. 
This involves a restatement of the powers and duties of the 
state board of education. As a member of the constitutional 
convention which will meet for the purpose of revising the con- 
stitution, you have been requested to serve on the committee 
on education. The task of this committee is to recommend the 
desirable changes in the educational organization. 
The committee has made a general survey of the powers and 
duties of the state board of education in each of 48 states. It 
appears that some of these state boards were created for the 
management of the state school finance exclusively ; some state 
boards for the control of state institutions alone; some only for 
the control of elementary schools; some for elementary and 
secondary; some for elementary and secondary and state nor- 
mal schools; and some for the control of all state institutions 
from kindergarten up to state university. 
As the purposes of state boards differ from one another, 
naturally they do in regard to the powers and duties. Hence 
the variation of powers and duties of the state boards among 
43 states is very great. In the school laws of 43 states, more 
than two hundred different powers and duties of state boards 
are found. These are condensed under more general terms 
into one hundred and forty-eight. 
The powers and duties of the ideal state board, as outlined 
by Professor Cubberley in his volume on State and County 
Educational Reorganization, are also included here and have 
increased the number to one hundred and fifty-one kinds. For 
convenience of study, these one hundred and fifty-one powers 
and duties are put under twenty-three headings. There is, 
of course, some overlapping among them. The list is given on 
the following pages.

  PROBLEM 4 
A STATE DEPARTMENT STAFF 
Problem: Probably the most important problem in a state 
department of education is how to secure and retain a com- 
petent professionally trained staff. Since most state superin- 
tendents are popularly elected, permanent professionally 
trained staffs are unlikely to be secured under such conditions, 
save through some form of civil service. At the same time, 
civil service commissions in actuality are far from perfect. In 
a state with nominal civil service regulations, how can the 
state superintendent of public instruction secure for his staff 
the best available persons in the country, with civil service 
tenure but without mechanical civil service selection and 
political interference? 
General Conditions. The problem arose because of the con- 
flict of views between a state superintendent of public instruc- 
tion and the civil service commission in that state. 
The state superintendent, selected at a popular election, was 
desirous of securing for his department the best professional 
men and women in the country at the salaries available and 
with civil service tenure. The state civil service commission 
under the law had the authority to prescribe examinations and 
make eligible lists from which most of the workers in this and 
many other departments at the capitol must be selected. The 
commission had divided such workers into “unclassified” work- 
ers (those requiring special qualifications for whom it had not 
yet been feasible to make examinations) and “classified” 
(those requiring only qualifications common to large numbers 
of workers in different lines, for whom eligibility examinations 
could be easily worked out). The commission had so far 
worked out examinations for the “classified” positions only and 
moreover it had been subject to various political pressures 
from time to time. 
22
-P-A-G-E-39
  NATIONAL AND STATE RESPONSIBILITY 23 
Both superintendent and civil service commission in all ap- 
parent sincerity claimed to be seeking only to render the 
greatest possible service to the state. Both sides, while never 
mentioning the fact, seemed equally desirous of exerting the 
additional power to be gained by winning the contest. Both 
sides at times admitted that the difficulties could not be ad- 
justed by the mere letter of the law. 
The problem was never permanently solved. The difficulties 
continued with varying intensities. First one side and then 
the other would have the upper hand. Whatever success was 
obtained by either side was apparently secured through polit- 
ical pressure, personal friendships and skillful playing up of 
its arguments in the public press. 
THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT’S POSITION 
1. That for his clerical workers, he had always gone to the 
“classified” lists of the civil service commission and always would 
as the commission was in this field doing a fine piece of work in 
which he would gladly codperate. 
2. That the department had reached a stage where his staff 
positions required the best people available in the entire country, 
that they therefore fell into the “unclassified” group and that he 
ought to be free to select these as he saw fit. In support of this 
view, he held: 
a. That he had gone to the civil service lists for staff members 
as long as he could secure properly qualified persons in the 
state. 
. That he now required a class of professionally trained men 
and women that the state admittedly was not producing. 
c. That competent persons from outside the state would not 
spend the time or the money to take civil service examina- 
tions on a mere chance of qualifying for an appointment. 
d. That the best ones from without the state would not submit 
to such an examination after appointment and that in any 
event such an examination would prove to be only a farce. 
e. That the staff positions in his department ought to be 
“unclassified” as were similar positions in many other de- 
partments. 
f. That the civil service commission did not have persons 
competent either to set or grade examinations for his staff. 
g: That his record showed his own qualifications for choosing 
staff members, it being generally admitted that up to that o 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  24 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
time he had secured better persons than had the state uni- 
versity and the normal schools for somewhat comparable 
positions, both of which institutions were not under the 
civil service commission. 
h, That there had been several cases of political pressure 
exerted on his department through the civil service com- 
mission in the matter of staff appointments. In particular, 
he instanced the act of a former civil service commission 
which had tried to force him to appoint a man thoroughly 
below par professionally and in addition a proved liar and 
one who would not pay his debts. 
THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION’S POSITION 
1. That if civil service authority was not recognized and civil 
service examinations taken, the staff members could not fairly 
claim civil service protection on tenure. 
2. That not following the principle involved here would in all 
probability ultimately corrupt the department and other depart- 
ments as well since it would be a bad example for the latter. 
The commission members unofficially said that they had no 
fault to find with the superintendent’s past selections and that if 
all the state executives had as high standards, the commission would 
have little to do. But they contended that his policy was not 
wise as a permanent thing for there was no telling what evil might 
result from it when another state superintendent came in. 
3. That what was done in other departments and institutions 
was irrelevant because the commission simply tried to do good 
wherever it could. The members argued: 
a. That the state department was clearly under their juris- 
diction. 
b. That it was doubtful as to whether some of the other de- 
partments were under their jurisdiction. 
c. That the law manifestly did not contemplate making them 
in any way responsible for the state university and normal 
school faculties. 
4, That their examinations were fair and entailed no real hard- 
ship on any competent persons. At various times they proposed or 
argued: 
a. That they always had the examinations made up and 
graded by university professors and other able persons 
whenever they did not feel qualified to do this work them- 
selves.
-P-A-G-E-41
  NATIONAL AND STATE RESPONSIBILITY 25 
b. That no competent person anywhere ought to be afraid to 
take the examinations they would give. 
c. That there ought to be enough competent people in the 
state to fill all the positions if only they could be found. 
d. That people from outside the state who were unwilling to 
take the examination or to stand the expense of it, had too 
little courage or too little interest in the work to be worth 
bringing to the state. 
e. That they merely wished to preserve their right to use 
drastic methods in emergencies and that they were willing 
whenever the superintendent could convince them that it 
was necessary, to give an appointee the examination some- 
time during his first year of work. 
5. That all the troubles of political pressures and unwise methods 
were the work of former members and that the present commission 
could not be fairly charged with the sins of its predecessors. 
Assignment 
Was the superintendent’s policy, from the standpoint of the 
best interests of the state, thoroughly sound? If so, how could 
he have secured its adoption as a settled policy in the state?

  PROBLEM 5 
RURAL EDUCATION 
Problem: The superintendent of public instruction in the state 
of Kandiana is in a quandary about keeping his promises to 
improve rural education made when he was running for elec- 
tion. He is sincerely desirous of keeping them, but thinks he 
may be completely blocked by the very inadequate professional 
training of the county superintendents of schools. What can 
he do to improve rural education, particularly on the instruc- 
tion side, both in the immediate future and as a long-time 
proposition? 
The state superintendent is familiar with the professional 
literature which advocates selecting a county superintendent 
through a county board of education. But he is himself 
selected by popular election, according to a constitutional pro- 
vision. The county superintendents are also selected by 
popular election. There is some dispute as to whether this 
method of selecting county superintendents is required by the 
constitution. The dispute could be settled only after a test 
case and much delay. Moreover, popular opinion is such that 
the state superintendent sees no likelihood of securing ap- 
pointed county superintendents within the next twenty-five or 
thirty years. 
The state annually distributes eighteen millions of dollars in 
state aid. Most of this is distributed on a per pupil of school 
age basis. But a beginning has been made in taking out cer- 
tain sums for special purposes before the regular distribution 
is made. 
Assignment 
What can the state superintendent do: 
1. To secure more professional work from the present county 
superintendents?

c. How should their salaries compare with the salaries of 
county superintendents? 
d. How can such assistants be kept on really constructive 
work and not be made mere clerks by the county 
superintendents?

districts for better rural schools? 
4. To bring about the election of a higher type of county

  PROBLEM 6 
ORGANIZING A HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT 
Problem: The superintendent of public instruction of the state 
of New Atlantic is asked by so many small districts for per- 
mission to open high schools that he feels called upon to try 
to set up standards for determining when a community is large 
and wealthy enough to start a high school with reasonable 
assurance of success. He utilizes the application of the village 
of Centralia for a high school as occasion for formulating 
a statement of policy in the matter. 
From the Centralia application and his official records he 
secures the following data: 
Population of Centralia at ten-year intervals: 1870—1500. 1880 
—1750. 1890—2150. 1900—2670. 1910—2900. 1920—3150. 
Estimated 1925—3200. 
Enrolment in present grades: I—90. II—60. IJI—55. IV—61. 
V—57. VI—49. VII—38. VIII—39. Total—449. 
At present Centralia students are going to other high schools as 
follows: Grades IX—21. X—17. XI—19. XII—11. Total—68. 
Current expense for elementary school the past year was $29,185 
of which $19,500 was for salaries of teachers. 
The assessed value of real estate in the village is $1,000,000 and 
assessment is about two-thirds of full value. 
Centralia is ten miles from the nearest railroad but has three bus 
lines running to Arden, Leeville, and Oakley, the nearest three 
towns located six, eight and ten miles distant respectively. At 
present thirty pupils go from Centralia to Arden for high school 
work, twenty-five to Leeville, and thirteen to Oakley. None of 
these communities is over 4000 population. 
Centralia comprises all land within a radius of four miles. All 
outlying territory is incorporated in other boroughs or villages. 
Expansion is not feasible and there would be few, if any, tuition 
pupils in a new high school at Centralia. 
For each of the Centralia students now going away to high school, 
28
-P-A-G-E-45
  NATIONAL AND STATE RESPONSIBILITY 29 
a tuition of $125 must be paid. Of this the state pays $50 and the © 
district of Centralia the remaining $75. : 
A new high school at Centralia would receive about $1500 in 
various forms of state aid. The teachers would average $1500 each 
to start and a principal would have to have at least $2000. 
He asks his high school supervisors to find what certain in- 
vestigations and authorities give on the following: 
1. How large do high schools have to be before the costs per pupil 
cease to vary much? 
2. How many teachers would such a high school need as a 
minimum? 
3. Is the attendance from a given area likely to be better in 
large or in small high schools? That is, to encourage high school 
attendance should the department advocate several small high 
schools or one large high school for a given area? 
4. About what proportion of the population could reasonably be 
expected to attend high school in such a community? 
5. Is the school enrolment by grades likely to guarantee a con- 
tinuance of the present ratio of high school enrolment to total 
population in the community? 
6. How much taxable property (real valuation) per child in high 
school should a community have? 
Assignment 
Write the state superintendent’s decision on the application 
of Centralia for a high school in such form that it can be used 
as a precedent in deciding similar cases in the future.

  PROBLEM 7 
THE CITY SUPERINTENDENT’S ANNUAL 
FINANCIAL REPORT TO THE STATE 
Problem: To secure an improvement on the part of the state 
department in the reports required of city school systems. 
In the city of Hinton, N. K., the superintendent for a period 
of three years has been endeavoring to develop a system of 
financial accounting in accordance with the uniform system of 
accounting proposed by the National Education Association, 
the National Association of School Business Officials, and the 
United States Bureau of Education. 
Each community in the state is required to submit an an- 
nual report to the state which includes among other things a 
statement of the expenditures made by each school system 
during the past school year. 
In this state, that section of the state annual report which 
covers the expenditures is as given below. The superintendent 
of Hinton finds it very difficult to make his distribution of 
expenditures in this form, while at the same time conforming 
to the itemized distribution of the annual report of the United 
States Commissioner of Education and to the principles of 
modern accounting as set up by the associations above named. 
As a result of this conflict, many of the items in this report are 
not ascertained definitely but are based upon estimates. 
Assignment 
1. What is the responsibility of the superintendents of the 
city school systems in this state toward the development of an 
improved and uniform system of accounting? 
2. At what time of the year is it most satisfactory for the 
school fiscal year to begin? July 1? August 1? January 1? 
September 1?

  PROBLEM 8 
POLICY OF STATE DEPARTMENTS 
Problem: The state superintendent of public instruction for 
Illinois was compelled to adopt a definite policy as regards 
assisting superintendents and boards of education to secure 
better teachers through the rating data on teachers already in 
the department, and through departmental recommendations 
of individual teachers for specific positions. 
The superintendents and boards of education frequently 
asked the department for estimates of teachers they thought 
of employing and resented any evasion in the matter, on these 
grounds: 
1. Practically all inspections of their schools and reports 
upon school work by the department, indicated that teachers 
were rated, and the criticisms made in terms of work of in- 
dividual teachers. 
2. That when the department indicated that a teacher was 
doing unsatisfactory work, the sensible way to cure the trouble 
was for the department to tell the local authorities where they 
could secure a teacher who would be satisfactory. 
8. That the department had no right to withhold from 
local authorities rating data which would prevent them from 
securing the best teachers possible, or particularly from secur- 
ing teachers who had been unsatisfactory elsewhere. 
4, That certain individual staff members of the department 
had for years been informally following the procedures ad- 
vocated in 2 and 3. 
The state superintendent admitted: 
a. That ratings of teachers observed were always made, for 
the state department staff appeared unable to make 
worthwhile inspection notes without such data. 
b. That staff members tried to rate teachers on a uniform 
basis so that they could utilize the work of other members 
visiting the same school in previous years. 
34
-P-A-G-E-51
  NATIONAL AND STATE RESPONSIBILITY 35 
c. That several members of the staff agreed with the super- 
intendents and boards of education and in the absence of 
special instructions to the contrary, had been following 
the procedure indicated. 
d. That certain other staff members had declined to recom- 
mend individual teachers for specific positions, and had 
evaded letting local school authorities know how they 
rated individual teachers. 
e. That under the law all “official” records must be acces- 
sible to all citizens who could show any reasonable 
grounds for examining them, so that the only way to 
prevent the use of teacher ratings would be to declare 
such ratings “unofficial.” 
But the superintendent thought it rather doubtful policy to 
make the ratings of teachers by staff members accessible to the 
public, or to encourage such accessibility, on these grounds: 
(1) Any low rating of a teacher on a brief visitation would 
in general be bitterly resented by that teacher and her friends 
on the grounds of unfair snap judgment made during the 
inevitably great strain of official state inspection. 
(2) Boards employing teachers recommended by the staff 
would expect to have the work of such teachers approved later. 
The department would thus in some cases be maneuvered into 
a situation where it could not well complain of the work in 
schools that had employed teachers recommended by it. 
(3) The department would be accused of running a teachers’ 
agency, playing favorites, and the like, thus losing its great 
assets of independence and impartial judgment. 
(4) While individual staff members had recommended cer- 
tain teachers to boards of education, and probably always 
would pursue this policy, it had been wholly informal and the 
department could not officially be held responsible for it. 
Assignment 
Write out a brief statement of policy on this problem along 
with pointed justifications for this superintendent, in such 
form that the written statement may reasonably be expected: 
1. To command the respect and support of local superin- 
tendents, boards of education and teachers generally. 
2. To secure a uniformity of action by staff members that

will be based on a belief in the essential soundness of the policy 
and not on the superintendent’s power to rule arbitrarily in 
the matter.

  PROBLEM 9 
NATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR EDUCATION 
Problem: There has been very vigorous discussion of the 
issue of federal support for education and of the desirability of 
establishing a federal department of education with a secretary 
in the president’s cabinet during the past few years. The Na- 
tional Education Association has lead the group of those who 
would provide federal aid in order to remove certain deficien- 
cies now commonly found in our scheme of public education 
throughout the United States, and has stood uncompromis- 
ingly for the establishment of a federal department of 
education. . 
The group opposed to both of these proposals have sup- 
ported their opposition by expressing their fear of federal con- 
trol of education. They have, as well, suggested that it is 
unjust to tax the people of one state in order to develop educa- 
tion in another state in the union. 
It is important for one who would consider the problem of 
federal responsibility for public education to become ac- 
quainted with the history of federal participation in the 
development of our public school system as well as to consider 
the arguments of those who fear the destruction of local 
initiative and local interest by virtue of federal aid. 
It is even more important to weigh those fundamental ideas 
which we commonly acknowledge—equality of opportunity 
provided through education, and equality of burden in support 
of those governmental enterprises which make for the common 
welfare against the suggestion that we will destroy our form 
of government, if we permit ourselves to move in the direction 
of further federal participation in our local affairs. 
It is not possible to give in a statement of the problem any- 
thing more than a very brief indication of these varying points 
of view. The solution of the problem will depend upon a very 
careful reading of the bibliography which is appended.

  38 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
Excerpts from Report of Legislative Commission, National 
Education Association, presented to the Representative As- 
sembly, July 6, 1922, Boston, Mass. 
The federal government cannot be indifferent to what is being 
- done in education in the several states. The ill effects of mal-educa- 
tion and the lack of education are as inevitable as are the good 
effects of proper education. The guaranteed freedom of movement 
from one state to another makes us as interdependent educationally 
as we are economically. The primary national importance of educa- 
tion demands that it should be made the equal of those other general 
welfare activities of our government now holding cabinet rank, but 
not exercising national sovereignty, such as agriculture, commerce 
and labor, each of which exists as a constructive governmental 
agency to promote the general welfare. 
A Department of Education is justified by the general welfare 
provision of the Constitution and by the historical development of 
our national government. The organization, supervision and ad- 
ministration of education is in all modern nations except the United 
States, included among the sovereign powers, because education is 
deemed necessary to the preservation and advancement of the 
nation. In the United States the sovereign power over education is 
by the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution reserved to the states 
respectively or to the people. But the national consequences of 
education as carried on by the several states are as far-reaching and 
as inescapable in the United States as they are in those nations 
which directly exercise sovereign power over education. The exer- 
cise of every sovereign function of the United States is determined 
by the education which is provided by the states. What is being 
done in the field of education is the most important thing nationally 
that is taking place in our country. 
We have already established in principle and in practice the right 
and obligation of the nation to aid the states in the development of 
their public school systems. From the very beginning of our history 
down to the present time the nation has seen fit through grants of 
land and of money to aid the states in the development of their 
schools. This aid has been given without infringing upon the con- 
stitutional right of the states to control their own schools. The 
Towner-Sterling bill explicitly safeguards the control of education 
by the several states in no uncertain terms. It provides that all 
the educational facilities encouraged by the provisions of this Act 
and accepted by a state shali be organized, supervised and adminis- 
tered exclusively by the legally constituted state and local edu- 
cational authorities of said state, and the Secretary of Education
-P-A-G-E-55
  NATIONAL AND STATE RESPONSIBILITY 39 
shall exercise no authority in relation thereto; and this Act shall not 
be construed to imply federal control of education within the 
states nor to impair the freedom of the states in the conduct and 
management of their respective school systems. 
At the end of each section authorizing an appropriation is added 
a further specific provision, that all funds appropriated for the 
particular purpose specified shall be distributed and administered in 
accordance with the laws of said state in like manner as the funds 
provided by state and local authorities for the same purpose, and 
the state and local educational authorities of said state shall de- 
termine the courses of study, plans and methods for carrying out 
the purposes of this section in said state, in accordance with the 
laws thereof. 
The federal government should assist the states in remedying 
the commonly existing defects in our educational system. Such aid 
from the federal government is justified by the very nature of 
our democracy. The most fundamental of all of those principles 
which underlie our government proposes that there shall be equality 
of opportunity, and as a corollary of this provision that the burden 
of supporting those services which make for the common good shall 
be spread as evenly as possible upon all of our people. The states 
vary greatly in their ability to support education. From the latest 
data available the true wealth per capita is found to vary in the 
several states from $726 to $5,038. The contrast is quite as startling 
if the true wealth per pupil enrolled in schools is taken. Here the 
variation runs from $2,561 to $19,377. The actual variation in 
ability to support education is even greater than would appear from 
these figures since income varies even more greatly than does wealth. 
The income derived by citizens of the wealthier states is de- 
pendent upon a market which is nation-wide. Income and excess 
profits taxes and internal revenue receipts generally are col- 
lected very largely in the states engaged in the manufacture and 
distribution of goods. These income and profits are derived from 
sales made to citizens throughout the nation. For example; during 
the fiscal year 1920-21 the state of North Carolina paid $79,573,000 
in internal revenue on the manufacture of tobacco. The product 
was used and the taxes actually paid throughout the length and 
breadth of the land. 
Neither ignorance nor learning can be segregated within the 
borders of any state. Education or the lack of it is felt throughout 
the nation. Ignorant men move from one section of the country to 
another. College graduates from the state universities of the na- 
tion are to be found in all parts of the country. The figures show
-P-A-G-E-56
  40 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
that from 16 to 63 per cent of the graduates of these institutions are 
distributed in states other than those in which they received their 
education. In like manner, in the privately endowed institutions of 
the United States from 20 to 88 per cent of the graduates are found 
in the states other than those in which the institution is located. 
Excerpts from “The New American Revolution” by Nicholas 
Murray Butler, an address before the Institute of Arts and 
Sciences, Columbia University, October 13, 1924: 
The Federal Republic, which the American mind chose as its 
form of government and constituted as such, is sui generis. There 
are other republics and there are other federal states, but no one 
of these has the characteristics of that Federal Republic which is the 
United States of America, and which have given the United States 
its unique place in the history of the last two centuries. 
Probably if the American people were directly asked whether 
they desired to change their form of government, their reply would 
be overwhelmingly in the negative. The number of those who 
consciously prefer a direct democracy or some form of class govern- 
ment to a representative federal republic is not large, and such 
arguments as they can advance in support of their preference beat 
hopelessly and helplessly against the protecting wall which justice, 
liberty and progress have built about the government founded upon 
the Constitution of the United States. There are, however, other 
ways of overturning or changing a government than by the method 
of direct attack. Foundations may be slowly yet steadily worn 
away by successive acts which, however well supported or seemingly 
innocent at the moment, have as a necessary consequence the 
weakening or changing of the American form of government as 
it now exists. Every transfer of activity from the sphere of liberty 
to the sphere of government—whether it be from Lord Moulton’s 
domain of free choice or from his domain of manners—is such an 
undermining of the foundations. Every attempt to make uniform 
by the force of federal power the conduct and activities of citizens 
in the several states, is an undermining of the foundations. Every 
attempt by use of the federal power to enable government to en- 
croach still farther upon the domain of liberty is an undermining 
of the foundations. When the foundations have been sufficiently 
undermined and the whole fabric falls, it is of course possible 
that something better and more worthy will be presented to the 
view of our children and our children’s children; but at least it 
will be something different, and the old American form of govern- 
ment will have disappeared.
-P-A-G-E-57
  NATIONAL AND STATE RESPONSIBILITY 41 
All this tempts to interesting reflection and suggests some very 
practical questions. How, for example, if some question economic, 
some question social, some question educational, presents itself as 
one that affects the whole people, can it be dealt with and answered 
save by increasing the authority and activity of the federal gov- 
ernment, even if by so doing we do hasten the change in our form 
of government itself? Must not a national need be met by a 
national effort? The answer is, Certainly; a national need must 
be met by a national effort; but that national effort need not be, 
and usually should not be, an effort by the national government. 
It should be rather a national effort by the people acting with 
substantial uniformity and singleness of purpose through their state 
and local governments and through their activities in the sphere 
of liberty. If that substantial uniformity and singleness of pur- 
pose can only be had by force, and that the force of the federal 
government, then they ought not to be had at all. The wise course, 
the American course, is to prefer reason to force, and by education, 
by exhortation, by moral and intellectual appeal, to bring about in 
natural and orderly fashion those public policies and that public 
conduct that are nationally desired, through use of the existing in- 
strumentalities and agencies and without undermining the founda- 
tions on which our government rests. This process may, like 
growth itself, take time; but it is time well spent. The end when 
so reached will then be really and not merely formally reached, for 
it will rest upon the conviction and willing codperation of those 
immediately affected. The opposite procedure, which is that of 
nation-wide, government-made conformity, must always fail except 
when confined to those fields of action which are, by common con- 
sent, appropriate not only to government control, but to federal 
government control. The moment that there is substantial dif- 
ference of opinion on this point, the method of force breaks down 
and untold political, social and moral damage follows in the train 
of the failure. 
There is also a political danger to be reckoned with. When a 
people is so diverse and so widespread as our own, when differences 
of climate and of soil are so varied, when economic and social 
characteristics are so multiform, it is surely the part of wisdom 
to maintain in fullest integrity that federal form of government 
which by leaving undisturbed the largest possible measure of local 
self-government and local control, makes possible that elasticity of 
the structure of government which enables it to adapt itself readily 
to these different and constantly changing conditions. A stiff, uni- 
form and brittle governmental structure extended over a wide
-P-A-G-E-58
  42 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
area and diverse economic and social conditions, is pretty certain 
to break to pieces before old age overtakes it. Uniformity and 
efficiency may be bought at a high price, and in their narrow and 
bureaucratic aspects they are not in harmony with the American 
temper and the American mind. Time and circumstance modify 
and sometimes profoundly alter the meaning of political phrases and 
slogans. When, during the period of nation-building, States Rights 
meant nullification and secession, it was a cry in opposition to 
the unity, the safety and the perpetuity of the American form of 
government; today the scene has shifted and the cry States Rights 
now signifies the preservation of that just and wise balance be- 
tween local self-government and central authority, upon which our 
social order and our system of government itself have alike been 
built. 
These weighty considerations are not confined to the field of 
political principle or to that of theoretical argument. They have 
had and are having grim and sufficient illustration in the public 
life and the political experience of the American people. Two of 
these evidences are completed acts and can be weighed with all 
their consequences; these are the Fifteenth or Suffrage Amendment 
and the Eighteenth or Prohibition Amendment to the Constitution 
of the United States. Two others are acts yet in the making, the 
tendency of which cannot be mistaken. These are the pending 
proposal farther to amend the Constitution of the United States by 
giving to the Congress power to limit, regulate and prohibit the 
labor of persons under eighteen years of age, and the legislative 
proposal to extend the largess of the federal treasury to the support 
of the public school systems established by the state. 
The new American revolutionists are beginning to appreciate 
the value for their purposes of the power given to the Congress by 
the Sixteenth or Income Tax Amendment. So long as direct taxes 
were to be apportioned among the several states according to their 
respective numbers, there was no great inducement to increase the 
amount or the incidence of direct taxation. When the Sixteenth 
Amendment removed this limitation, a new and most inviting 
temptation was offered to those with plans for new governmental 
expenditure. One group of Representatives and Senators could 
now vote a direct tax, while the constituents of another and much 
smaller group of Representatives and Senators would have to pay 
the bulk of it. Under these conditions it was inevitable that plans 
for the increase of federal appropriations should multiply thick and 
fast. Not a few school administrators and teachers, thinking
-P-A-G-E-59
  NATIONAL AND STATE RESPONSIBILITY 43 
rather of immediate results than of fundamental principles and 
more permanent ends, became insistent that the federal treasury 
should allocate a large sum annually to the several states for various 
laudable purposes connected with the system of public education. 
Those who brought forward this proposal had no difficulty in 
asserting that public education is hampered in many directions 
through lack of adequate financial support, and that despite im- 
provement in recent years, the members of the teaching profession 
are not yet paid as they should be. How easy then, and how simple, 
. to bring about what is naively called codperation between the 
federal government and the states by securing from the federal 
government a hundred million dollars a year to be distributed to 
the states! It is stoutly asserted that no measure of federal con- 
trol is to be allowed to follow the federal appropriation, but that 
the autonomy and responsibility of the states in respect of their 
several school systems are to be carefully preserved. This can only 
mean that the Congress of the United States is to vote a vast annual 
appropriation for allocation to the several states without asking 
what they do with it or without making certain that this great 
sum is wisely spent. Of course no Congress could or should do any- 
thing of the sort. “For where your treasure is, there will your heart 
be also,” and control must inevitably follow financial support. 
Moreover, the one hundred million dollars a year with which it is 
proposed to begin this policy, is something less than the city of 
New York alone expends on its system of public education. Dis- 
tributed over the whole United States this sum would bring but 
inconsiderable benefit and relief. The demand would be made, and 
with reason, that, the principle having been established, the amount 
of the federal appropriation should be adequate, and that the 
sum of five hundred millions, or even a thousand millions if need 
be, should be devoted to this purpose. Serious as the financial prob- 
lem would become, that of school administration and school con- 
trol would be far greater. The American public school is in a 
peculiar sense the product of the locality and the constituency which 
it serves. Its strength has lain in its intimate relationship with 
home and family, with church and neighbor. Cut these ties of 
local intimacy and interdependence and substitute a mechanically 
operated unit, however efficient, of a huge national machine, and 
the American system of public education will have disappeared. 
Should Matthew Arnold return to earth and make an official in- 
spection of our educational system, he might then be told as he 
once was told by the Minister of Public Instruction in France, that 
at that particular moment every school throughout the United
-P-A-G-E-60
  44 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
States was doing precisely one and the same thing. The new 
American revolution would then have gained another victory at the 
expense of one of the most precious of American institutions. 
Taken from the Minority Report of the Committee on 
Education of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States 
on Vocational Education, January 18, 1916: 
Your Committee on Education has been giving its attention to 
vocational education, and particularly to the desirability of the 
federal government actively and directly participating with the 
states in providing such training in agricultural, trade, and in- 
dustrial subjects that throughout the country, wherever labor is 
applied, it will be applied intelligently and with a maximum of 
efficiency. 
In studying this subject your Committee has been aware that the 
Chamber of Commerce of the United States, at its annual meeting 
in 1913, adopted resolutions strongly endorsing the principle of 
liberal appropriations by the federal government for the promotion 
of vocational education in the states. In this expression of the 
attitude of the National Chamber the Committee heartily concurs. 
The Committee accordingly recommends that the Chamber of 
Commerce of the United States shall reaffirm its belief in this 
principle. 
Under the constitution the federal government has the duties and 
obligations which are peculiarly necessary to our existence and wel- 
fare as a nation. It deals with foreign countries and is responsible 
for our position among nations and not only promotes but regulates 
our interstate and foreign trade. In order that achievement may 
be encouraged in useful industry, the federal government, by ex- 
press authority of the Constitution, gives to inventors a monopoly, 
limiting it only in years and exacting on behalf of the general 
welfare only that there be such disclosure of the secret that at the 
end of the term all may be free to use it. 
The welfare of the nation, its position among other nations, and 
the happiness and well-being of a great part of its citizens depend 
upon a great and immediate extension of vocational education. Un- 
less its citizens who work with their hands are so trained that they 
can be efficient at their immediate tasks, and by reason of their 
training can make their industrial efficiency a means for their own 
personal advancement, the industrial and commercial position of 
the United States as a nation will be progressively impaired. 
In addition to the considerations which have been outlined above, 
there is justification for federal action in precedents which extend
-P-A-G-E-61
  NATIONAL AND STATE RESPONSIBILITY 45 
backward for many years. For example, the federal government 
has in the aggregate appropriated more than $45,000,000 to the 
agricultural and mechanical colleges of the states. For the support 
of common schools in the western states it has given lands in excess 
of 130,000,000 acres. The Secretary of Agriculture, in his annual 
report dated November 13, 1915, said that in the current year his 
department has available from existing appropriations the sum of 
$1,200,000 for extension work in agriculture. The grants from the 
federal government have been justified because of their effect in 
promoting general and national welfare. 
In May, 1914, Congress inaugurated a new series of appropria- 
tions, to be devoted to aid in diffusing . . . useful and practical 
information on subjects relating to agriculture and home economics, 
and made permanent appropriations accordingly. In the present 
year the federal appropriation is $1,080,000, and it is to increase 
without further action on the part of Congress until in six years it 
will be $4,580,000 at which figure it will continue year after year. 
To each dollar of these appropriations the states will have to add 
at least a dollar from their own funds, and the federal law provides 
for efficient use of the appropriations by preventing their investment 
in buildings or other plant facilities and by limiting to five per cent 
the part that may be spent for printing. 
Your Committee earnestly believes that both general welfare and 
national welfare require that the federal government should at 
once extend its aid to the states for training in trade and industrial 
subjects as it has with great success and great national benefit for 
many years assisted the states in agricultural instruction. It be- 
lieves, too, that the federal government should lend its aid to the 
states for further vocational education for agricultural pursuits. 
Without the assistance of federal appropriations, and the impetus 
which will come from such appropriations, the states can themselves 
develop vocational education only very slowly. The industrial 
welfare of the country, however, demands all the haste that is con- 
sistent with care. The Federal Commission on National Aid to 
Vocational Education, appointed by the President in 1914, reported 
that only eight states had established systems for vocational educa- 
tion, and that these systems have not yet reached one per cent of 
the workers who need industrial training. The urgency of the 
necessity that the United States as a nation should be industrially 
efficient, in its shops and factories as well as on its farms, appears 
to leave no recourse other than prompt action by Congress. 
It should be noticed no suggestion is made that the federal gov- 
ernment should do more than extend its financial assistance and  
-P-A-G-E-62
46 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
the encouragement which will flow from its appropriations and its 
example. The administration of the schools would remain wholly 
in the hands of local authorities and the instructors would be 
municipal or state employees, and not federal employees. 
In this report the Committee does not have in mind the higher 
instruction already given in technical subjects by many excellent 
institutions, both state colleges and institutions supported by private 
endowment. Nor has it in mind agricultural extension work, for 
which the states and the federal government are now spending co- 
operatively $5,000,000 or more a year. It has in mind instruction 
of a vocational kind for the great number of children who now 
leave school at fourteen years of age, and go to work. It is in the 
training of this great body of workers that federal aid is impera- 
tively and immediately necessary. 
From the Majority Report of the Committee on Education 
of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, January, 
1916: 
  The Questions Before Us.—By far the most important subject 
submitted to this committee is the question of federal participation 
in education. 
Shall the states continue to maintain and be responsible for the 
public schools of the country? 
Shall the national government take over the support and control 
of the schools? 
Shall there be a divided support and control, partly vested in 
the national government and partly vested in the states? 
These questions are not academic. They are of the utmost 
practical importance and they are now before the American people 
for decision. 
For a decade, and with especial vehemence since the war, a 
nation-wide propaganda has been carried on looking toward the 
gradual transfer of responsibility for the support and control of 
our public schools from the state, and local unit within the state, to 
the federal government at Washington. 
If we travel this road we shall end with a huge bureaucratic 
machine at Washington having its Secretary of Education in the 
cabinet, its assistant secretaries of education and a horde of bureau 
chiefs and clerks and three-quarters of a million of federal em- 
ployees teaching in the schools and bossed by several thousand field 
inspectors, supervisors, and other petty traveling officials. 
Federal Board for Vocational Education —This nation-wide prop- 
aganda succeeded in 1917 in securing the passage of its first bill and
-P-A-G-E-63
  NATIONAL AND STATE RESPONSIBILITY 47 
created at Washington a Special Federal Board to control vocational 
education. This national vocation board is now operating from 
Washington, disbursing federal money, laying down regulations, 
controlling, inspecting, and dictating the manner in which vocational 
education shall be carried on by the states, the cities and towns, 
and other local educational units. 
Sterling-Towner Bill—Now comes the so-called Sterling-Towner 
bill prepared by collaboration between representatives of the Na- 
tional Education Association, representatives of the American 
Federation of Labor, and representatives of the American Federa- 
tion of Teachers, composed of those teachers who have joined the 
American Federation of Labor. This bill was introduced at the 
request of the National Education Association and the American 
Federation of Labor, hearings were held and it was favorably re- 
ported in the last Congress by the House and Senate Committees 
on Education, but failed to come up for action before the end of the 
session. It has again been introduced during the present Congress 
and is now in the hands of the Senate and House Committees. 
Sterling-Towner Bill Most Radical Step Towards Federalizing 
Schools.—This Sterling-Towner bill, which constitutes a long and 
radical second step towards federalizing the schools of the country, 
calls for the appropriation of the round sum of one hundred million 
dollars, of which $7,500,000 is to be expended for teaching illiterates, 
$7,500,000 for Americanization work (which chiefly means teaching 
illiterates beyond school age English and to read and write), 
$20,000,000 for physical training, $15,000,000 for training teachers 
and $50,000,000 for increasing the pay of teachers throughout the 
country. 
Framers of Constitution Intended to Leave Education in Hands 
of States—The Constitution does not mention education, and no- 
where gives the federal government authority to direct or control 
education. As this power was not reserved by the constitution to 
the federal government, it means that the framers of the constitu- 
tion deliberately intended to vest in the states the power to establish, 
maintain, conduct and control education. This did not mean that 
the framers of the government in establishing this federal democ- 
racy failed to realize the importance of education, but that like 
many other activities vital to the welfare of our people and the 
continuation of our form of government they believed education 
should be carried on with better regard to the interests and wishes 
of the people, with better adaptation to local needs, and with 
greater efficiency and more economy if left to the states than if it
-P-A-G-E-64
  48 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
should be federalized and conducted by a great bureaucratic ma- 
chine located at the seat of government. 
Dangers of Federal Control.—Great is the danger of handing 
the power of controlling the ideas and ideals of the growing genera- 
tion to a group of bureaucrats located far away at the seat of 
government. 
They may willfully do great damage. They may unquittingly 
sow seeds on a nation-wide scale which will only fructify after 
many quiet years of germination so that the noxious weeds can 
perhaps only be eradicated by the slow growth of public reaction 
after grievous and perhaps irreparable injury to our body politic. 
Germany to her ruin and sorrow has reaped her harvest from 
seeds quietly sown in her schools for many years by the Berlin 
bureaucracy. The world’s history is strewn with the wreck of gov- 
ernments whose disintegration began when the people saw the 
local control of their dearest concerns taken away and concen- 
trated in the hands of a bureaucracy at the seat of empire. The 
creators of our federal government were fully alive to the dangers 
of a great bureaucracy established at the seat of our government and 
wisely undertook to protect us from it for all time. 
Control of Schools for the People Should Remain Near the People. 
—The genius of our people should and must control our schools. 
There is nowhere else to place this trust. But if our people are to 
control our schools and to cause them to be sensitive to their ideals, 
to their varying needs from year to year and from locality to 
locality, those in charge must be near them, accessible to them, and 
responsive to them. A vote once in two or six years from a member 
of Congress or a Senator who is to live at the seat of government 
far from home, and who must be elected to attend to a hundred 
other things and can therefore rarely be elected on an educational 
issue, coupled with the rigidity which would almost certainly be 
attained by the managing bureaucracy at Washington would make 
our school system about as sensitive and responsive to the average 
man as a ton of pig iron to a tack hammer. 
Constant Practice in Local Self-Government Vital.—Moreover, if 
our government is to survive, if these 100,000,000 people, soon to 
become 200,000,000 people, made up of racial stocks from many 
countries, embodying many varying degrees and forms of civiliza- 
tion, and of governing knowledge or rather lack of knowledge of 
self-government, are to succeed in maintaining and carrying on 
this great federal democracy, it will only be by the constant 
practice of local self-government in things which vitally concern 
them, constant practice in critical local affairs, in affairs which are
-P-A-G-E-65
  NATIONAL AND STATE RESPONSIBILITY 49 
not matters of comparative indifference but of such vital con- 
sequence that the people will be hurt, and seriously hurt, if they 
are not conducted properly. These alone will teach each succeed- 
| ing generation and the millions of less experienced people arriving 
from foreign shores what good government is and what bad govern- 
ment is, and how to secure the former. 
Excerpts from Legislative Commission Series, No. 3, Na- 
tional Education Association, January, 1923—“The Relation- 
ship of the Federal Government to the States as Set up in 
the Towner-Sterling Bill’: 
EXPERIENCE PROVES FEDERAL AID STIMULATES STATES 
Experience shows that the distribution principle of the Bill 
operates to stimulate the state. The way in which federal aid has 
operated to increase expenditures by states for state colleges of 
agriculture and mechanic arts is seen in the fact that appropriations 
by states for these institutions increased eight fold in the nineteen 
years following 1896, while the appropriations of state owned, con- 
trolled, and operated normal schools, receiving no federal aid, in- 
creased only three fold in the same time. The appropriations per 
student enrolled increased 128 per cent and 60 per cent respectively.1 
It may be objected that reasons other than federal aid were in- 
volved in this matter. Such reasons certainly did not operate with 
regard to federal aid for vocational education. In 1916, the year 
before the passage of the Smith-Hughes Act, there were only 
fifteen states that made appropriations for vocational education. 
In 1921, forty-eight states made appropriations for this purpose. 
In 1916, the fifteen states appropriated $1,300,510.15 for vocational 
education, while in 1921, a total of $5,319,216.91 was appropriated 
by states for this purpose. In 1916, local appropriations amounted 
to $2,118,208.96 for vocational education by twenty states. In 
1921 forty-six states made local appropriations amounting to 
$9,057,985.09 for the same purpose. When the combination of 
state and local appropriations is considered we get the full force of 
the incentive which is supplied by Federal aid. In 1916 there was 
available in twenty-two states a total of $3,418,719.11 for voca- 
tional education. In 1921 there was available in forty-eight states 
a total of $14,377,202.00 for vocational education. When the 
federal appropriation of $3,097,932.02 is added to the foregoing 
we find that a grand total of $17,475,134.02 was available for voca- tional education in 1921 as against $3,418,719.11 for the same pur- pose in 1916.

    50 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
The poor as well as the rich states, under the stimulus of federal 
encouragement, greatly increased the funds available for vocational 
education. Even in Mississippi, one of the poorest states, the sum 
provided for vocational education was increased from $5,000 in 
1916 to $174,184.30 in 1921. If Georgia could receive from the 
federal government $775,350.94 for the removal of illiteracy on 
the condition that it raise an equivalent amount by state and local 
taxation for the same purpose, it is probable that adult illiteracy 
would disappear very rapidly. If Massachusetts could receive 
$587,880.98 for Americianizing its foreign-born residents, on the 
condition that it raise an equal amount for the same purpose, it is 
probable that its Americanization activities would be greatly and 
speedily increased, for in Massachusetts, under the stimulus of the 
Smith-Hughes Act, the funds available for vocational education 
were increased from $820,892.13 in 1916 to $3,026,934.37 in 1921.1 
The real question at issue is not the inequality in the per capita 
wealth of our several states. The question is whether the people 
everywhere are willing to give through state and local taxation alone 
the money that is necessary to support such an educational pro- 
gram as the safety, perpetuity, and advancement of our nation de- 
mand. Evidently they have not been willing to do so up to the 
present time. If they had, the existing defects, that cannot be 
denied or controverted, would not be crying aloud in the appealing 
voices of children for remedy. 
In the face of such facts and conditions, the Towner-Sterling Bill 
proposes to extend what has already proved wise and successful: 
viz., the principle of federal aid. 
STATES WILL NOT SURRENDER THEIR CONTROL 
The federal appropriations for good roads on the so-called 50-50 
basis have stimulated the states to go far beyond equalling the 
federal aid granted for this purpose. As yet, no state has ever 
thought of giving up the control of its highways simply because 
the federal government has helped financially in their construction. 
The mere repetition of the assertion that federal aid on a 50-50 
basis will lead the states to give up their Constitutional control 
of education is not proof. Our experience is conclusively to the 
contrary. The end sought by the Towner-Sterling Bill is the stim- 
ulation of the states to do effective work in the five specified fields. 
The doing of this will result in great national benefit. It is but fair 
*These figures as to expenditures for vocational education are based on 
reports received from forty-eight state directors of vocational education 
received in May, 1922, by the National Society for Vocational Education.
-P-A-G-E-67
  NATIONAL AND STATE RESPONSIBILITY 51 
that the nation should help toward the payment of the expenditures 
necessary to the securing of this national benefit. If a lighthouse in 
Boston Harbor can be built at national expense on the ground of 
national benefit, every expenditure contemplated in the Towner- 
Sterling Bill can be defended on exactly the same basis. 
Therefore, the entire argument of the opponents of the Towner- 
Sterling Bill, regarding the pernicious and deadly effect of the basis 
on which it is proposed to distribute federal aid to the states, is 
faulty. There is to be no autocratic Secretary of Education and 
therefore there will be no person seeking, and no situation designed, 
to bribe and induce the states to give up their present control over 
public education within their own borders. 
NATIONALIZATION OF EDUCATION NOT POSSIBLE UNDER BILL 
The Towner-Sterling Bill does not contemplate, nor even make 
possible, the nationalization of education and of the teaching force 
of the public schools. If the Bill did contemplate any such thing, 
the opponents would be able to point out the language of the Bill 
or the relationships set up in the Bill which really look toward or 
hint at such a calamity. This they are unable to do. 
What does the nationalization of education mean? It can mean 
but one thing, viz., organizing and controlling public education as it 
is organized and controlled in those nations which control public 
education. The Towner-Sterling Bill confirms our present Constitu- 
tional control of public education by the states. It therefore takes 
a distinct, definite, and positive stand against the nationalization of 
education. 
What does the “nationalization of the teaching force” mean? It 
can mean but one thing, viz., employing teachers by the nation and 
thus making them national employees. This is not the case now. 
The Towner-Sterling Bill confirms the existing situation as regards 
the employment of teachers by the properly constituted educational 
officers of the several states. Therefore, the Towner-Sterling Bill 
takes a distinct, definite, and positive stand against the “national- 
ization of the teaching force.” 
The assertions of the opponents of the Towner-Sterling Bill about 
a horde of Bureau chiefs and clerks and several thousand field in- 
spectors, supervisors, and other petty traveling officials are wild 
flights of imagination invoked to frighten those who do not under- 
stand the provisions of the Towner-Sterling Bill. The whole con- 
ception of “nationalizing education and the teaching force” has 
been conjured up as an argument against the Towner-Sterling Bill 
without any relation to the provisions of the Bill itself.
-P-A-G-E-68
  52 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
NEITHER AUTOCRATIC CONTROL NOR EXTRAVAGANT WASTE 
The opponents of the Bill take the position that unless there is 
absolute autocratic control, there must inevitably be extravagant 
waste because of the entire absence of control. 
The fallacy in this position is in the ambiguity of the word con- 
trol. In one sense this word means absolute authority over or 
absolute regulation of. In another sense it means guidance accord- 
ing to definite, agreed-upon standards. For example, a legislature 
controls the appropriations for a state university by voting for the 
use of the institution a specified sum of money for operating expen- 
ditures. It does not, however, specify exactly how many tons of coal 
may be bought nor what brand of chalk or ink shall be purchased. 
The legislature also controls the broad, general policies of the in- 
stitution by declaring what schools, or divisions, or departments it 
may operate. No state university would undertake to establish a 
law school, or a medical school without legislative authorization. It 
would not expect, however, that the legislature would go on to 
specify in detail just what courses should be included in the curric- 
ulum, just what teachers should be employed, just what qualifica- 
tions these teachers should have, just how many hours they should 
teach each week, just what textbooks should be used, just what 
lesson should be assigned, and just how the students should be 
graded. When, however, autocratic control is used by opponents of 
the Bill, it is just such detailed regulation that is implied and is 
brought to mind. All of the foregoing things and a multitude of 
others must be decided by someone. The implication is that they 
must be decided by the one who is boss—the one who controls. In 
the case of the Towner-Sterling Bill, the proposed Secretary of 
Education is made into the imagined ogre. This idea of an auto- 
cratic overlord in education, who constantly interferes with the 
machinery of state and local educational procedures, is kept in the 
foreground. Then, as if realizing that the picture is overdrawn, 
the brief in opposition tries to hang the whole proposal of the 
Towner-Sterling Bill on the other alternative of no control at all 
and pictures the result as tremendous, extravagant waste. It is not 
necessary to make a choice between these two extremes. There is 
a sane middle ground. This the Towner-Sterling Bill recognizes. 
It is not the embodiment of the principle of autocratic control nor 
of the principle of laissez faire. It takes the middle ground. The 
Bill sets up certain things which the secretary of Education may 
do. By implication and by a long line of legal decisions, he can- 
not do what he is not authorized to do. He is not authorized to 
control education in the states. Therefore, he cannot control it.
-P-A-G-E-69
  NATIONAL AND STATE RESPONSIBILITY 53 
The Towner-Sterling Bill sets up certain conditions under which 
federal aid for specific purposes may be given to the states. No 
state is coerced into accepting these conditions. If they are ac- 
cepted, the state is morally and legally bound to live up to them 
in good faith, because acceptance of these conditions constitutes a 
contract between the federal government and the state. 
GOVERNMENT WILL AUDIT EXPENDITURE OF FEDERAL MONEY 
When such a contract has been entered into, the federal govern- 
ment has, according to the provisions of the Towner-Sterling Bill, 
the right to audit the expenditures of the state to see that the money 
allotted by the federal government has been spent for the specific 
purpose in question and that at least an equal amount has been 
spent by the state or local units for the same specific purpose. This 
is neither the autocratic control nor the utter absence of control 
which the opposition sets up as the only logical alternatives. It is 
simply the middle ground of common sense, or the application of 
the principle of the square deal. 
There has undoubtedly been extravagant waste of lands granted 
to the state in aid of education. It is not advisable (nor is it 
proposed) to make annual, outright gifts to the states for any 
educational purpose, however important this educational purpose 
may be nationally. We have already reached the time when 
bounties should not be given. Free gifts by the federal government 
are, or should be, wholly impossible. The utter denial of federal 
aid is not the only alternative course. The Towner-Sterling Bill 
proposes simply that measure of control which is safe and fair to 
the federal government and to the several states. It proposes an 
eminently fair and equitable plan of assuring each and all of us 
that owr money is being expended by the several states for the 
specific purposes for which it was allotted and in accordance with 
the terms of a contract freely entered upon. Any more control than 
this is a clear invasion of the rights of the states. Any less control 
than this is indefensible. It is the measure and form of control 
which fair dealing demands. 
Finally, the opponents of the Bill take the position that setting 
up standards, no matter how good or necessary they may be and 
giving someone the power to withhold appropriations furnishes a 
very solid foundation for the superstructure of federal control. 
Let us examine these standards critically to see if there is any 
possibility of their development into the substance of federal control.  
-P-A-G-E-70
  54. PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
STANDARDS OF TOWNER-STERLING BILL CONSIDERED 
A. Each state must appropriate and use as much for a given 
- specific purpose as it receives for this purpose from the federal 
government. 
This becomes a part of the contractual relation between the 
federal government and the states accepting the terms of the Bill. 
This contractual relation cannot be changed except by mutual con- 
sent. Therefore, it does not promise anything in the way of federal 
control. 
B. In order to receive an allotment for the equalization of educa- 
tional opportunities, each state must agree to: 
(a) Have all of its public schools open for at least six months. 
(6) Enact and enforce a compulsory attendance law. 
(c) Provide by law that the basal instruction in all schools, 
both public and private, shall be in the English language. 
We submit that no one of these requirements taken alone con- 
stitutes federal control of public education within the states, nor 
do they collectively look toward federal control. 
The federal government desires to have the states equalize educa- 
tional opportunities within their several borders more fully and 
more adequately than they have done. It sets up certain allotments 
as incentive and inducement. It also sets up the three conditions 
that have been enumerated as necessary to equality of educational 
opportunity. It would be foolish to make an outright gift to the 
states for any purpose. In the interest of justice and fair play, 
all monies appropriated from the federal treasury should be spent 
for the purposes for which the appropriation is made. It is idle to 
call this sensible, sane safeguarding of the national interest the 
very solid foundation for the superstructure of federal control. 
The appropriations to and the conditions set up for colleges of 
agriculture and mechanic arts do not operate, as the years go by, 
to bring these institutions more and more under federal control. 
The highways to whose construction the federal government has 
contributed have not fallen under federal control. There is such a 
thing as genuine codperation that is mutually advantageous and 
that is free from all taint of domination by either party. It is 
such codperation, with no hint or promise of federal control, that 
is embodied in the standards set up by the Towner-Sterling Bill. 
To say that there should be no terms or conditions set up in a 
codperative agreement is equivalent to saying that the foundation 
for misunderstanding should be embodied in the contract. To say 
that the setting up of any terms whatever means the domination 
of one party or the other is not a justifiable conclusion.

Excerpts from “In Support of a Proposal for a Bill to Create 
a Department of Education” prepared by George D. Strayer, 
and published by the National Education Association, July, 
1925, follow. 
THE HISTORY OF THE MOVEMENT 
Congress established a Department of Education without rep- 
resentation in the President’s Cabinet in 1867. The Department 
was reduced to the status of a Bureau in 1869, and has continued as 
such until the present day. The National Education Association 
has repeatedly petitioned Congress for the reéstablishment of a 
Department of Education with a Secretary in the President’s 
Cabinet. In 1918 the president of the National Education Asso- 
ciation, then Mrs. Mary C. C. Bradford, State Superintendent of 
Public Instruction of Colorado, appointed a commission to inquire 
concerning the emergency in education. This commission reported 
in favor of the establishment of a Department of Education with a 
Secretary in the President’s Cabinet, and for further federal support 
for education. A bill was introduced into Congress embodying 
these recommendations and has been reintroduced in each succeed- 
ing session of Congress. 
FEDERAL AID OMITTED FROM THE BILL NOW PROPOSED 
During the period of the past six years opposition to the National 
Education Bill has centered in considerable measure on the pro- 
posal to grant additional aid to the states. There has been a 
sincere difference of opinion with regard to the wisdom of this 
feature of the earlier bills. Whatever point of view one may take 
with regard to the national responsibility for the support of 
education, it is certainly true that there is little, if any, prospect 
of action by the next Congress in support of further federal aid 
for education. 
With these facts in mind the Legislative Commission of the 
National Education Association has sought, with the codperation 
and advice of leaders in education throughout the United States, to 
develop a bill which will embody the other part of the program 
which the Association has so consistently supported. 
THE DRAFTING OF THE BILL 
The bill, which is presented for the consideration of all members 
of the profession and for laymen who are interested in the develop- 
ment of education, is the result of the work of a great many men 
and women who have participated in conferences and who have  
-P-A-G-E-72
  56 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
reported their criticisms during the period of the past few months. 
A first draft was prepared at a conference held at the National 
Education Association headquarters in Washington on March 7. 
This proposal was sent to leaders in education and to the represen- 
tatives of lay organizations who have supported the movement to 
establish a Department of Education. Many thoughtful criticisms 
were received. Another conference was held in Washington on 
May 25, at which time there was a most vigorous discussion of the 
principles which should be embodied in the bill. As a result of 
this conference a second proposal was drafted. Both proposals 
were printed and submitted to a conference called in Indianapolis 
at the time of the meeting of the National Education Association, 
June 29. There were invited to this conference all state superin- 
tendents of schools, all secretaries of state teachers’ associations, 
representative city and county superintendents of schools, univer- 
sity, college and normal school presidents, and representatives of 
privately endowed institutions. As a result of this conference the 
proposal for a bill to create a Department of Education, which is 
now presented for the consideration of the profession, was adopted. 
PRINCIPLES EMBODIED IN THE NEW BILL 
The National Education Association in convention on July 2 
instructed its Legislative Commission to present to Congress a bill 
embodying the following proposals: 
(1) The creation of a Department of Education with a Secretary 
in the President’s Cabinet. 
The transfer to the Department of Education of the Bureau 
of Education and of the Federal Board for Vocational Edu- 
cation with the provision that the Federal Board for Voca- 
tional Education shall operate as a division of the Depart- 
ment of Education, and that the Secretary of Education 
shall be a member of this Board and ex officio chairman of 
it; that the authority, powers, duties, conferred and imposed 
by law, upon the Secretary of the Interior with relation to 
the Columbia Institution for the Deaf and Howard Univer- 
* sity be exercised and performed by Secretary of Education. 
(3) In order to codrdinate the educational activities carried on 
by the several executive departments, and in order to devise 
ways and means of improving the work of the federal gov- 
ernment, there shall be created a Federal Conference on 
Education which shall consist of one representative and one 
alternate appointed by the head of each department. 
(4) The Department of Education shall collect such statistics (2 LS
-P-A-G-E-73
  NATIONAL AND STATE RESPONSIBILITY 57 
and facts as will show the condition and progress of educa- 
tion in the several states and in foreign countries; and in 
order to aid the people of the several states in establishing 
and maintaining more efficient schools and school systems, 
research shall be undertaken in all fields which, in the 
judgment of the Secretary of Education, may require atten- 
tion and study. 
(5) The Department shall make available to the educational 
officials in the several states and to other persons interested 
in education the results of researches and investigations con- 
ducted by it. 
(6) The sum of $1,500,000, or as much thereof as may be 
necessary, shall be appropriated annually for the purpose 
of paying salaries, for conducting studies and investigations, 
and for such other purposes as may be necessary to enable 
the Department of Education to carry out the provisions of 
the act. 
There has been little dissent from the proposal that we seek to 
establish a Department of Education with a Secretary in the 
President’s Cabinet. From every source there has come support 
for the idea that efficiency and economy in government require 
the consolidation in a department of those federal agencies now 
dealing with education. If the Department is to serve as a fact- 
finding and fact-distributing agency, it must have financial sup- 
port sufficient to enable it to carry on its work. The proposed ap- 
propriation of $1,500,000 annually is based upon a careful study of 
the cost of assembling data on a nation-wide basis, and on the 
assumption that it would be advisable to cover the whole field of 
education once in every five years.   
WE NEED A DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION RATHER THAN AN ENLARGED 
BUREAU OF EDUCATION 
There are those who propose that all of the functions of a De- 
partment of Education could be exercised by the Bureau of Educa- 
tion, if the Bureau were adequately supported. There are several 
reasons why it is desirable to create the Department, rather than 
to hope for adequate development through the Bureau of Edu- 
cation. First of all, it is important to bring about the consolidation 
of federal agencies concerned with education. No one would 
seriously propose that this could be accomplished through the 
development of the Bureau of Education. The undertaking is of 
greater importance than that associated with the status of a bureau
-P-A-G-E-74
  58 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
in the Department of the Interior. If educational research is to 
be adequately supported, it will be necessary that this function 
of the federal government be presented for the consideration of 
those who make the budget by one of no less rank than a cabinet 
officer. All matters of national concern involve education. It is of 
the utmost importance that the representative of this most impor- 
tant governmental service sit at the council table of the nation. 
We have two sorts of executive departments in the federal gov- 
ernment—those charged with administrative responsibility such 
as war, post office, treasury, and those that have been organized 
for the promotion of the general welfare, agriculture, commerce, 
and labor. It is not an exaggeration to propose that the welfare of 
all the people of the United States is more certainly determined by 
the progress which we make in education than by our economic 
well-being as promoted by the Departments of Agriculture or Com- 
merce, or by the social adjustments which may be made by the 
Department of Labor. 
THE CREATION OF A FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DOES NOT 
INVOLVE FEDERAL CONTROL OF EDUCATION 
The federal government has promoted education from the 
earliest days of the republic. By grants of land and of money 
from the federal government our school system was first 
established. The federal government is now spending approxi- 
mately forty million dollars annually for the support of education, 
other than that involved in the rehabilitation of the veterans of 
the World War. The creation of a Department of Education, the 
primary function of which is to carry on research and to dissemi- 
nate useful information, has nothing in common with the administra- 
tion and control of education. Those who have supported the crea- 
tion of a federal department are unalterably opposed to the 
centralization of the control of education in the federal govern- 
ment. It is just as certainly possible to promote education through 
reporting experiments which are undertaken, through informing 
people throughout the country of the adaptation of education to 
the needs of particular communities, as it has been to promote 
agriculture through the distribution of the results of experiments in 
that field. 
THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION A FACT-FINDING AND FACT- 
DISTRIBUTING AGENCY 
Progress in education is dependent upon the scientific evaluation 
of current practices and upon the dissemination of the results of
-P-A-G-E-75
NATIONAL AND STATE RESPONSIBILITY 59 
such inquiries to all interested in education. The Federal Depart- 
ment of Education should have on its staff a group of the most 
competent scientific workers in the field of education. These men 
and women will have as their primary object the assembling of 
facts and their interpretation. Wherever unusual progress is made 
or a worth-while experiment carried on, the Federal Department 
of Education will be in position to make available for the whole 
country the results of these undertakings. It is through scientific 
investigation, and in this way only, that we may be confident of 
making progress in the development of our school system. It is 
absurd to propose that we may not codperate in such an important 
undertaking because this codperation in order to be most effective 
must be carried on by a federal agency. 
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DOES NOT 
INVOLVE THE NATION IN FURTHER FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR 
OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
The establishment of a Federal Department of Education is 
distinct from the issue of further federal support. The increase in 
efficiency and the economy that can be effected by the consolidation 
of those agencies, now operating in the federal government looks 
in the opposite direction. The support of research in a Federal De- 
partment of Education promises returns in increased efficiency and 
in actual savings which will amount to many times the cost of the 
researches undertaken. In a single field, like that of developing 
more adequate and more economical plans for school buildings, it is 
possible to save to the states and to the localities within the states 
tens of millions of dollars. Every improvement in methods of 
teaching, in the adaptation of schools to the needs and capacities 
of individual children, in the development of more adequate courses 
of study will add untold millions to the wealth of the country and 
will promote the happiness of our people. If the scientific inquiries 
undertaken by the Department of Education should clearly in- 
dicate that the Nation should furnish a larger degree of support for 
education, the question of providing this support would still rest 
with Congress. If the people of the United States become con- 
vinced of the desirability of a larger degree of national support 
for education, they will secure appropriate legislation. Surely no 
fair-minded person can object to the establishment of a Depart- 
ment of Education whose primary function it ig to record the 
facts, available alike to those who favor larger federal support and 
to those who are opposed to this policy. 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
  60 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
VIGOROUS SUPPORT OF THE BILL BY ITS FRIENDS WILL INSURE ACTION 
BY CONGRESS 
A great majority of those who are well qualified by experience to 
anticipate the contribution which may be made by a Federal De- 
partment of Education are agreed that it would do much to stimu- 
late educational endeavor and to increase the efficiency of our 
schools. Efficiency and economy demand that we consolidate 
within a Department of Education those agencies dealing with 
education now distributed among the several executive departments 
of our federal government. Surely no one who would promote 
education can object to the establishment of a fact-finding and 
fact-distributing agency with sufficient support to enable it to con- 
duct inquiries in all of the more important phases of education. 
The time has come for action. It is important that our people be 
fully informed as to our program. We shall succeed because of 
our willing, practical, thoroughgoing devotion to the cause. 
Assignment 
1. Should the federal government increase its grants to the 
states in support of public education? 
2. If such continued and increased support is justified, under 
what conditions, if any, should the money be granted? 
3. Should a federal department of education with a secre- 
tary in the President’s cabinet be organized? 
4. If such a department were to be organized, what federal 
agencies should be included in the new department? 
5. What significance does the participation in education of 
a central government have for the development of education 
in a nation? 
6. Consider these facts: The federal government in the 
United States is engaged in research in a number of fields; 
school systems, universities and other agencies are spending 
large sums for educational research. Is it important that the 
federal government enter the field of educational research? 
7. How would you go about developing a budget for a fed- 
eral department of education, if such a department were to be 
created within the next year? ‘ 
8. What relationship exists between a state’s economic re- 
sources and the provision that it will make for education? 
9. Of what significance is the existence of significantly differ- 
ent levels of educational provision in the different states?

  PROBLEM 10 
RELATIONSHIP OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF 
SCHOOLS TO THE BOARD OF EDUCATION 
The Problem: To develop the proper relationship between the 
board of education and the newly elected superintendent of 
schools. The tradition in the community for a period of 
twenty-five years has given to members of the board of educa- 
tion executive functions. The new superintendent of schools, 
a professionally trained man, must modify the situation, if he 
is to do efficient work. 
The board of education is made up of five members who 
serve for terms of four years. The board by its organization 
provides for the following standing committees—supplies, 
buildings and grounds, finance, textbooks, courses of study, 
teachers. The attitude of the board is indicated clearly by the 
distribution of a small directory giving the names and ad- 
dresses of board members, the names of officers and chairmen 
of committees, and the time and place of meeting of the board 
and of committees, to teachers, other employees and interested 
citizens. The suggestion has been made that this directory 
will help them to approach the proper members of the board 
on school issues in which they are interested. 
The newly elected superintendent of schools has made a 
careful study of the methods of procedure as recorded in the 
minutes of the board of education for the past few years. He 
has been forced to reach the conclusion that his predecessors 
in office have not had the power or authority necessary for the 
development of efficiency in the administration of the schools. 
The minutes reveal the fact that the board of education has 
little or no appreciation of the professional service which a 
superintendent of schools should render. Action by the board 
in the great majority of cases has been upon recommendation 
of a standing committee. In a few cases such action has been 
developed by discussion in board meetings. [Illustrations of 
the board’s procedure follow:

-P-A-G-E-82
  66 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
1. The minutes of the meeting at which teachers were employed 
three years ago record a resolution adopting a salary schedule 
recommended by the committee on teachers. The superintendent 
learned on investigation that the committee was assisted in the 
development of this schedule by a local attorney-at-law. The 
committee proposed action because pressure had been brought to 
bear upon the chairman by a group of elementary school teachers. 
The high school and junior high school teachers were inactive and 
for that reason no salary schedule was proposed for them. 
2. The finance committee reported a possible deficit of $75,000 
in the revenue available to meet operating expenses for the year. 
A resolution was adopted directing the chairman of the finance 
committee to consult with a representative of the state department 
of education concerning possible retrenchments. 
8. The committee on textbooks proposed and had adopted a 
resolution which placed the choice of basic readers in the hands 
of primary teachers. The resolution provided that these teachers 
be divided into four groups, each group to be assigned a particular 
reading method and asked to try it out. Later in the year these 
four groups submitted reports to the textbook committee. On the 
basis of these reports this committee recommended the adoption 
of one of the four sets of readers. The board approved the recom- 
mendations of the committee. 
4. The minutes show a similar procedure in the adoption of a 
textbook for elementary English. 
The minutes indicate, as well, that both the regular meetings 
of the board and committee meetings are utilized for the dis- 
cussion and action upon many unimportant matters which 
would ordinarily be considered merely administrative details. 
Illustrations of this type of action follow: 
1. The supply committee repeatedly reports action on requisi- 
tions from teachers and principals. Other cases show requisitions 
by the superintendent of schools referred to the supply committee 
with power to act. In still other cases the chairman of the supply 
committee reports that he has purchased certain articles and asked 
that the board approve his action. 
2. The minutes of the board meeting immediately preceding the 
regular meeting at which the present superintendent of schools was 
employed show approval of the requisition from the superintendent 
of schools for three reams of mimeograph paper. 
3. At a meeting of the board of education the principal of the 
junior high school appeared before the board to request an altera-
-P-A-G-E-83
  LOCAL ADMINISTRATION OF SCHOOLS 67 
tion in a temporary partition in the study hall of his building. At 
the same meeting the director of vocational work appeared before 
the board in order to secure permission to change the location of a 
motor in the machine shop. In both of these cases the matter was 
referred to the buildings and grounds committee with power to 
act. 
The board of education has assumed large administrative 
responsibility. It is equally clear that there has been little 
effort to hold the superintendent of schools responsible for re- 
sults. The minutes of the board show no detailed reports by 
the superintendent of schools on the achievements of the 
school system nor do they indicate any evidence in support of 
proposals concerning the future development of the schools. 
There has not even been an annual report issued for a number 
of years. There has been no regular budgetary procedure. 
During each year a deficit of considerable amount has been 
piled up. 
The minutes of the board record the employment of teachers 
on the recommendation of the superintendent of schools. 
Upon careful inquiry it appears, however, that board members 
have been very active in determining the recommendations 
made. Candidates for teaching positions regularly interview 
board members before filing their application with the superin- 
tendent of schools. 
It appears, as well, that a number of teachers were dropped 
from the list of those recommended by the former superin- 
tendent of schools. The board took this action, as the record 
shows, in order to save money. There was no record, however, 
that in dropping eighteen teachers the superintendent of 
schools had been consulted with respect to those who might be 
dropped with least injury to the school system. There was 
some suggestion at the time that the former superintendent of 
schools resigned that he and the board had not worked together 
harmoniously. There is no suggestion, however, in the record 
that was made, nor in the published accounts of the action, 
that anybody appreciates the distinction between the ex- 
ecutive functions of the superintendent of schools as related to 
the legislative power of the board of education. 
In the consideration of this problem the following statement  
-P-A-G-E-84
68 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
of the relationship between boards of education and superin- 
tendents of schools is offered for your consideration: 
In order that the relationship between boards of education 
and superintendents of schools be acknowledged by both 
parties and to some degree standardized, it proposed that a 
committee made up of members from both groups prepare, in 
terms of a code or set of rules, a statement of the relationship 
of the school executive to the board of education. There are 
presented for the consideration of this committee the following 
proposals: 
1. That the most important duty of the board of education is to 
select its chief executive officer, and to appoint him for an indefinite 
term. 
2. That the board of education recognize the fact that its chief 
executive officer should nominate all associate or assistant superin- 
tendents, supervisors, directors, principals, and teachers, and all 
other employees, and that appointments to all of these positions be 
made only upon the nomination of the superintendent of schools. 
This provision is to be interpreted as opposed to the establishment 
of the codrdinate executive office of business manager, and to re- 
quire that such officer be designated as assistant superintendent in 
charge of business affairs. It is also to be interpreted as opposed 
to the organization of a board of superintendents with powers 
coérdinate with that of the chief executive. 
3. That the board provide, by its own rules, that the adoption 
of textbooks and of courses of study be on the recommendation 
of the superintendent of schools, and that it require that he in- 
dicate in making his recommendations the degree of codperation 
which he has received from his assistants and associates of the 
administrative, supervisory, and teaching staff. 
4. That the board require that the superintendent of schools re- 
port from time to time concerning the achievements and progress 
of the school system in terms of (a) the adequacy of the attendance 
service; (b) the progress of children in the school system, involving 
studies of retardation and elimination; (c) the adequacy of the 
adjustment of the school system to the needs of children in terms of 
the school organization, the classification of pupils, the courses of 
study, the organization of special classes, and the like. 
5. That the board require the superintendent of schools to submit 
annually a budget showing the estimated revenue available, or to 
be made available, where the tax rate is fixed by the board of edu- 
cation, together with the program of work to be accomplished and 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
  LOCAL ADMINISTRATION OF SCHOOLS 69 
the estimated costs by divisions and activities of the school system; 
that such budgetary estimates be based upon an analysis of costs 
by divisions of the school system, and by units of the school organi- 
zation for one or more previous years; that such budgetary 
estimates include a salary schedule based upon principles which 
can be applied uniformly throughout the school system, and that 
such estimates include as a special item a report on the present 
condition of the school plant with reference to the need for 
repairs, reconstruction, or replacement of equipment. 
6. That the board of education require that the superintendent 
of schools direct a continuing study of the need for new school 
sites and buildings based upon an assembling of data showing trends 
in population for the whole community and shifts in population 
and in public school enrolment by convenient areas and by grades 
or other divisions of the school system; and that it pass upon the 
needs of financing such additions to the plant as may be necessary 
or expedient. 
7. That the board pass upon the plans for new buildings ap- 
proved by the chief executive officer and his staff and that the 
superintendent of schools indicate in the case of each plan so pre- 
sented the necessity for the accommodations to be provided in 
terms of present or prospective enrolments not otherwise adequately 
provided for, and in terms of the relationship of the facilities to 
be provided in the new structure to the courses of study to be 
taught therein. 
8. That the board act as a committee of the whole in considering 
passing upon the program and particular recommendations of the 
superintendent of schools, and that all standing committees be 
abolished. 
9. That the board of education adopt a set of rules governing its 
own procedure in which is established the position of the superin- 
tendent of schools as the chief executive officer of the board of 
education, and indicating his responsibility and relationship to the 
board as has been suggested above; that these rules define the 
qualifications of all of the employees of the board of education, 
and that they include a consideration of such other matters of 
uniform procedure as may be essential to the proper conduct of a 
system of schools. 
Assignment 
1. What changes in the organization of the board or in its 
method of doing business would you consider so essential that
-P-A-G-E-86
  70 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
you would require action by the board in line with your pro- 
posals immediately? 
2. How would you hope to develop during the period of your 
first year of service a definite attitude upon the part of board 
members toward the work of the superintendent of schools? 
3. Indicate in detail the activities of your office and the 
methods of bringing them to the attention of the board of 
education that you would expect to be effective in overcoming 
the undesirable traditions with respect to the relation of the 
superintendent to the board. 
4, How soon would you expect to ask the board to adopt a 
set of rules defining the relationship of the superintendent to 
the board of education and otherwise indicating the principles 
to be acknowledged in the administration of the school?

RULES OF BOARDS OF EDUCATION 
Problem: Your board of education has asked you to submit for

  PROBLEM 12 
THE COUNTY SCHOOL UNIT 
Problem: How shall the payment of the debts of existing dis- 
tricts be made when a larger district is established as a fiscal 
unit? 
In a midwestern state the legislature will soon have before it 
for consideration a bill to change the school unit of fiscal and 
educational administration from the township to the county 
basis. This “county unit” bill transfers all school property to - 
the county board of education, erases all township lines in so 
far as school districts are concerned, provides that a county tax 
shall raise the revenue needed for school purposes, etc. How- 
ever, one feature of the bill that caused much trouble two 
years ago when the same bill was before the legislature was 
concerned with the disposition of the present indebtedness of 
the school township units. The township trustees who at 
present administer the schools in the various townships are 
opposed to the county unit bill. They are organized and have 
been developing feeling among the people against it. 
An accompanying chart shows one county in that state. 
Table 1 gives the assessed value of real property and the ap- 
proximate value of school property and the school debt for 
each township. It will be noted from Table 1 that some town- 
ships are practically out of debt. They have either used a pay- 
as-you-go plan, are now in need of new buildings, or have 
developed transfer of pupils to an advantage. Examples of 
these are townships 6, 8, and 11. Other townships have just 
completed new buildings and are heavily in debt as townships 
1 and 10. Some have been poorly administered and their prop- 
erty valuation is as low as No. 7. Some of this present indebt- 
edness is due to current expense, and not capital outlay.

a—This is a very poor township that has been equally poorly managed. 
b—This township is just outside the county seat. It transfers all pupils to the city 
schools. It has united with the city in building a new high school building. It has sold 
other school property. 
e—Its share of the high school in the city. 
The following plans are suggested for the solution of the 
problem: 
1. That the county take over, with all the school property, 
all of the indebtedness of the township. To pay off this 
indebtedness by a levy on all the property taxed in the 
county. 
2. To allow the present civil township to pay off its own 
debts. 
3. To make an accounting of the capital expense for each 
township for a period of the last fifteen years. The county 
to take over the indebtedness up to that amount and the 
township to pay all indebtedness above that. 
4. To appoint a committee in each county to appraise the 
school property of each township. If this appraised value 
be less than the present indebtedness, then such amount 
to be paid by the township within fifteen years by addi- 
tion to its regular school tax.

PROBLEM 13 
CITY AND COUNTY SCHOOLS CONSOLIDATED 
  Problem: A bill has been introduced in the legislature to make 
the public system of City Annaville a part of the public school 
system of Wooster County. ... The bill provides for a 
county board of education to be elected at large. This board 
is to have complete control of the schools of the county. The 
bill provides that the board may levy a tax of ten mills for 
current expenses, and upon vote of the people they may in- 
crease this rate not to exceed twenty mills. It is also provided 
that bonds may be voted by the people and that the board may 
levy such tax as may be necessary to pay interest upon and to 
retire these obligations. The author claims that the purpose 
of the bill is to improve the educational opportunity of the 
children and to relieve the financial burden due to the present 
dual method of financing education. The city board of edu- 
cation claims that this is an effort by certain taxpayers and 
politicians to reduce taxation for schools. 
The Present Situation. The city has a charter from the 
legislature authorizing it to establish and maintain a public 
school system independent of the county system. The county 
system includes all the other schools in the county. 
1. The city. The city acting under its charter receives state 
aid directly from the state which together with revenue de- 
rived from taxation at the rate of seven mills is used to defray 
current expenses. The city issues bonds and pays interest on 
capital outlays, this upon a vote of the people. The board of 
education may cause any rate to be levied for current expenses 
up to ten mills. The tax digest for the city shows $5,000,000.00. 
The same property is valued on the state and county books at 
$3,000,000.00. The city school term is nine months. The en- 
rolment in city schools is 1,000 pupils. The city employs 34 
teachers. The city population is 7,500. The superintendent 
is elected by the board of education at an annual salary of 
$3,250.00. The superintendent devotes all his time to admin- 
istration and supervision. The principals devote a part of 
91 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
  92 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
their time to supervision, the high school principal devoting 
a majority of his time to administration and supervision. 
2. The county. All other schools in the county are under 
the county system. County assessed values outside the city 
amount to $2,500,000.00. The state assesses on the basis of 
the county valuations. The county tax levy for education is 
four mills over the county as a whole outside the city. Each 
district may levy an additional amount up to five mills. The 
county board of education may increase its rate from four to 
five mills which is the limit allowed by law. A district may 
levy an additional amount up to five mills for the purpose of 
paying interest on bonds for capital outlay which has been 
authorized by a vote of the people of the district. County 
schools now operate seven months in the year; the enrolment 
in the county schools is 1,400. The county superintendent is 
elected by a vote of the qualified voters at a salary of $2,000.00. 
He devotes a part of his time to this position. There are no 
supervisors for the county schools. Most of the sixty teachers 
teach in one- and two-teacher schools. 
Assignment 
If the proposed bill were to become a law— 
1. (a) Would the educational opportunity of the children 
in the county be improved? How? Why? 
(b) Would the educational opportunity of the children 
in the city be changed? How? Why? 
2. (a) What would be the effect upon the administration 
and supervision of the county schools? 
(b) What would be the effect upon the administration 
and supervision of the city schools? 
3. (a) Would the revenue available for county schools be 
increased or decreased? 
(b) Would the revenue available for city schools be in- 
creased or decreased? 
4, Would you as superintendent of the city schools support 
or oppose the bill and why?

  PROBLEM 14 
ORGANIZATION OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION 
Problem: In the city of Grayson, N. K., 35,000 population, 
the Board of Education has been organized on the standing- 
committee basis for a period of twenty-five years. It has been 
the custom to hold executive meetings of these committees at 
which most of the problems of the school system were dis- 
cussed in the privacy of the committee. A policy of “com- 
mittee courtesy” has been followed, usually resulting in the 
unanimous adoption by the Board as a whole of the recom- 
mendations emanating from the committees. 
In a number of cases, the committee action has really been 
the action of the chairman of the Board. This has resulted 
from long tenure of. chairmanships and from a particular 
interest which these chairmen have shown from time to time 
in the field of activity assigned to the committee. The local 
press and some representative citizens have raised the question 
with the Board of the desirability of continuing these tradi- 
tional methods of conducting its affairs. The changes in mem- 
bership of the Board of Education over a period of twenty-five 
years, the salient facts concerning committee organization and 
procedure and the superintendent’s professional opinion con- 
cerning this problem are presented herewith. 
The superintendent greatly favors standing committees. He 
gives the following reasons: 
1. A superintendent needs advice concerning local condi- 
tions. 
2. By previous discussion, all doubts may be cleared up in 
the minds of the committee members so that they are 
ready to act without asking embarrassing questions in the 
open board meetings. 
3. By presenting projects to committee members in advance, 
the superintendent is able to secure hearty champions in 
open board meetings.

The superintendent should not bear the sole responsi- 
bility before the public for the many complex and deli- 
cate issues that constantly confront him. His security 
grows to the extent that he is able to pass on some of this 
responsibility to the duly selected representatives of the 
people of the school district. 
. Business is expedited rather than retarded by committee 
action. 
. Board members feel that they have been entrusted with 
the management and control of the school system and 
that they would be untrue to this trust if they did not 
enter into some intimate relationship with the schools 
through consideration of details as committee members. 
When asked to be specific, the superintendent of schools 
gave the following illustration of important committee 
activities: 
a. 
é. High School Examination Committee decides appeals re- 
garding graduations—hearings given pupil by principal 
and superintendent; if not settled, referred to High 
School Examination Committee. List of graduates also 
submitted to this committee. 
. The Teachers’ Committee does not limit superintendent 
in his recommendations. Board usually approves recom- 
mendations of committee. Teacher list is signed by 
committee and superintendent. 
. Buildings and Grounds Committee has charge of repair 
work; inspects buildings once or twice a year. Each 
principal submits repair list, superintendent checks and 
then list is approved and catalogued by Executive Com- 
mittee. 
. Written reports are submitted by all committees on im- 
portant matters. All committee reports are practically 
always accepted by the Board. 
Visiting Committee approves supply list; and is court of 
last resort in cases of discipline. 
The following four tables, taken from the Annual Reports 
of the Superintendent to the Board of Education, give data 
on the number of years different individuals served as mem- 
bers of the Board of Education, the functioning of the Execu-

PROBLEM 15 
THE EDUCATIONAL PROBLEM OF CRAIG TOWNSHIP 
Problem: To be in a position to make constructive recom- 
mendations to a board of education, the superintendent of 
schools must learn to analyze a community. The facts con- 
cerning Craig Township have been given in sufficient detail to 
enable students to discover how they may be related to the 
advancement of the educational program. In the light of 
these facts what are the more important recommendations 
which the superintendent of schools should make to the board 
of education? 
Craig Township lies in an eastern seaboard state, about 30 
miles from the Atlantic Coast. Map No. 1 gives the outline 
of the township. The long dimension is approximately 9 miles, 
the short dimension from north to south approximately 4 
miles. The territory of the township may be divided into 
two sections, the light sandy soil section of the western section 
and the swamp section of the east. The street and road 
lines on the map form an index of the segregation of popu- 
lation. 
The township has a prosperous trading center. The indus- 
trial development has been limited to light manufacturing on 
a small scale, such as garment-making and leather shoe- 
making. Two main lines of important railways run to large 
urban centers to the east and west. These railway lines are 
used by commuters to these larger centers who have been 
attracted to the community by the open and attractive nature 
of the country and the salubrious climate. 
The assessed valuation of the township is $6,250,000. It is 
estimated that property is assessed at 75 per cent of real 
valuation. 
Cranberries are the chief product of the eastern bogs and 
swamps. ‘The western section produces small fruits and 
101

  102 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
  peaches in considerable numbers, while certain sections are 
devoted to the production of sweet potatoes, vegetables and 
other similar products of a like sandy soil. 
The population, as determined by the 1920 United States 
Census, was 7,300. About 50 per cent of the population con- 
sists of Italian families, whose workers are engaged largely in 
the agricultural pursuits. The families are large in size, many 
of them having 5, 6 and 7 children. About 70 per cent of the 
children in school are of Italian descent. About 40 per cent 
of the children in school come from Italian stock, of which 
they are the first to be born in America. The community was 
originally settled by New Englanders who migrated to this 
section because of the possibility of producing fruits at lower 
costs and less energy than in their own home sections. Pro- 
fessional and business groups are in part drawn from this latter 
class. 
The graduating class of 1924, numbering 54 members, shows 
about 20 per cent of Italian names and a small percentage of 
Jewish names in addition to the older American names. 
Grade Enrolment. The enrolment by grades for the Craig 
Township schools for the years 1922-1925 is shown in Table 1.

The School Plant. The school plant consists of one cen- 
tralized set of buildings in the most thickly populated section 
of the township and eight rural schools, as indicated in Map 
No. 1. The rural school buildings are located on small plots; 
they are three- or four-room buildings with unfinished base- 
ments; outhouses have been placed to the rear. Some atten- 
tion has been paid to play apparatus on each of the school 
grounds. Classes taught in these rural schools are as follows:

  LOCAL ADMINISTRATION OF SCHOOLS 103 
School A. JEFFERSON (3 rooms)—3rd and 4th grades; 2nd

School D. PINE HILL (4 rooms)—5th grade; 4th grade; 2nd

School G. ALLENDALE (2 rooms)—2nd and 3rd grades; Ist 
grade. 
School H. LAKEWOOD (3 rooms)—4th and 5th grades; 2nd and 
8rd grades; Ist grade. 
An elementary parochial school was begun in 1924, drawing 
its children mainly from the first six grades. 
The community itself gives evidence of gradual growth and 
will tend to grow more rapidly within the next decade. 
The Central School Plant. The central school plant is 
shown in Map No. 2. It consists of five parts which are 
marked A, B, C, D and E on this map. 
Section A consists of three parts, the oldest part having 
been built in 1893. A rear section was added in 1909 and a 
connecting section of four rooms in 1921. The first floor of 
this building is utilized by grades 5, 6 and 7. On this floor 
are twelve classrooms varying in characteristics according to 
the year of construction. The second floor is utilized by grades 
8 to 12 inclusive. The high school is developed on a four- 
year high school basis. ~ 
The second floor has a small office for the superintendent 
of schools, a high school library and School Board office com- 
bined, one large assembly room for the senior high school 
accommodating 200 children, also one large assembly for the 
8th grade seating 113 children. There is no office for the 
high school principal who utilizes the desk in the high school 
study for office purposes. The classroom facilities for the high 
school on this second floor consist of three congested recitation 
rooms seating 25 each, a physics laboratory with obsolete 
equipment limited to 12 pupils, a chemistry laboratory sim- 
ilarly congested with the equipment for 12 pupils. The book- 
keeping room seating 30 children has an eight-foot type-

writing annex at the front of the room separated by a glass 
partition. The mathematics room and history room each seat 
35. The classroom facilities for the 8th grade at the rear of 
the building consist of three rooms seating 35 each. A manual 
training room equipped with 3 lathes and 20 benches with 
limited storage and tool provisions is located in a dimly lighted 
basement room. Toilets are in poorly lighted basement rooms. 
Section B is an eight-room building of two stories with outer 
walls of brick and inner construction entirely of wood. ‘The 
stairways and cloakrooms form a cross in the central part of 
the building. The kindergarten children and grades 1 to 4 
are housed in this building. 
Section C is a one-room wooden structure which, at present, 
is housing kindergarten children only. 
Section D is a one-story rather dilapidated frame hall for- 
merly used for town-meeting purposes. It is now used largely 
for the work of physical training of the high school and grades. 
Section # is an attractive wooden residence which has re- 
cently been purchased by the Board of Education and is used 
for classes in sewing, French, stenography and typewriting. 
Because of overcrowding conditions in Section B, two classes 
of each of the 1st and 2nd grade are also taught in this resi- 
dence. Conditions require part-time programs for all grades. 
Enrolment by School Divisions. The enrolment as pub- 
lished in the report of the clerk of the Board of Education on 
February 1, 1925, is as follows:

The manual training schedule is scheduled at the same time 
as the sewing. The boys go into manual training, while the 
girls are in sewing. 
Curricula. The school issues each year a sheet on which 
are outlined the curricula. The publication for 1923-1924 is 
shown on page 112. 
No attempt has been made to develop a course of study. 
It is the assumption of the Board of Education that the state 
course of study is being followed by teachers. 
High School Graduation. The number of high school grad- 
uates for a period of twelve years is as follows:

Non-Resident Pupils Enrolled. The community has at- 
tracted a number of non-resident pupils because of its accessi- 
bility and the lack of proper educational facilities in near-by 
vicinities. The non-resident enrolment in February, 1925, is 
shown in Table 3, above. 
The problem of transportation is best indicated by the fol- 
lowing excerpt from the Report of the Clerk of the Board of 
Education. 
The number of pupils listed for transportation increases every 
year. The current term approximately 236 pupils have been listed as 
against 181 listed for last term. The list for the present term 
includes 10 high school pupils and 226 pupils below the high school 
grade—grammar and primary grade pupils—all within the district; 
an increase in transportable pupils listed is 55 over last year. 
High and grammar grade pupils are being transported from the 
suburbs to Central School. Fifth grade pupils are being transported 
from Allendale and Jefferson to Pine Hill; fourth-grade pupils from 
Jefferson to Horse Pike; fifth-grade pupils from Horse Pike to 
Peach Grove and a few primary pupils to Peach Grove and Lake- 
wood. Pupils are also being transported to the Special Class at 
Old Middle Road Schoolhouse. 
Additional Car—Owing to the increase in the number of pupils 
to be transported and to the overtaxing of the three buses operated 
for two years past, your Board felt justified in purchasing a fourth 
car, which was put in operation early in January, the present year. 
At best the transportation problem is a vexatious matter. 
In passing, your Board would direct attention to the fact that in 
the distribution of the state and county funds for the present term,
-P-A-G-E-130
114 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
the sum of $3,516.45 was refunded to the Craig Township District 
on account of transporation, cost of cars, operation and mainte- 
nance, last year.

Length of School Term and Special Officers. The facts in 
this field are best indicated by this excerpt from the last 
annual report of the Board of Education: 
School Term—Same as heretofore, forty weeks in Central and 
thirty-eight weeks in Rural Schools. 
Attendance Officer—No change—Mrs. Mathewson still holds the 
position at salary of $800.00 per year. 
In the performance of her work, which at times becomes almost, 
if not quite, a disagreeable duty, the Attendance Officer has received 
valuable advice and assistance from Chief Probation Officer Edward 
E. Hall. : 
Medical Inspector—Dr. Butler has held this position since Dr. 
Howell’s demise. The salary is still $800.00. 
Nurse—Your Board is still providing the salary of $125.00 per 
month for Child Welfare Nurse, Miss Ruth Locke, and contemplates 
a continuation of the service and assumption of the salary another 
year. 
Manual Training—The work in this department still consists of 
shop woodwork and sewing. For reasons previously given, your 
Board has refrained from making attempts to fully establish the 
contemplated Domestic Science Course.

PROBLEM 16 
STATE SUPPORT OF EDUCATION 
Problem: Should a radical change be made in state aid to 
schools in the State of Minnesota? 
1. Ina recent issue of a daily newspaper of the state, which 
has a large circulation and which has a great influence upon 
the thinking of the people there appeared an article which 
made the following assertions: 
1. That state taxes have increased because of state aid to schools. 
2. That state aid has not been paid in full and that school dis- 
tricts have suffered thereby. 
3. That strong opposition has developed to granting aid for spe- 
cial departments in schools, such as agriculture. 
4. That the newly inaugurated governor is opposed to such special 
aids. : 
. That the commissioner of education does not favor continu- 
ance of such special aids indefinitely for any one district. 
That the school districts are seeking to retain the full amount 
of state aid in the form of “flat” aids, without any require- 
ments being attached to the granting of the same. 
7. That there is danger of a “pork barrel” distribution of state 
aid. 
8. That there is strong opposition to state regulation of schools. oO a 
It is apparent from the arguments which have been ad- 
vanced that there is a strong endeavor being made to bring 
pressure upon the present legislature to abolish all special state 
aids to schools, and to grant generous aids to the districts with- 
out specifying any requirements to be met by the local school 
authorities. This has been a live issue in this state for many 
years.

tracts from the school laws of the state bearing upon the 
requirements for state aids follow.

  128 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
For the purpose of aid to public schools, there shall be established 
the following funds: . 
a. The endowment fund, which shall consist of the income from 
the permanent school fund. 
b. The current school fund which shall consist of the amount de- 
rived from a state one mill tax. 
c. The special state aid fund, which shall consist of the sums 
appropriated by the legislature for special aid to public schools 
or departments in the schools. 
The endowment fund shall be distributed semi-annually by the 
State Board of Education to school districts whose schools have been 
in session at least seven months, in proportion to the number of 
scholars of school age who have attended school at least forty days 
during the preceding year. 
The current school fund shall be distributed on the same basis 
and at the same time as the endowment fund except such part as 
the state auditor on the recommendation of the State Board of 
Education shall set aside from the current fund each year for dis- 
tribution with the special state aid fund. 
The State Board of Education shall distribute the special state aid 
fund, and any other sums which may be appropriated by the state 
for distribution with the special state aid fund, in such manner and 
upon such conditions as will enable school districts to perform ef- 
ficiently the services required by law, and to further the educational 
interests of the state. To this end the said board shall have power 
to fix reasonable requirements for receiving and sharing in the state 
aid provided that in no case shall teachers’ salaries be made a re- 
quirement for such aid. Public schools of any district receiving or 
seeking to receive special aid shall at all time be open to the inspec- 
tion of the State Board of Education, or its duly authorized agents, 
and the accounts of any such district shall be open to inspection by 
the public examiner upon request of said State Board of Education. 
Purposes of Special State Aid.—State aid from the special state 
aid fund and also any other moneys set apart for use with the special 
state aid fund shall be for the following named purposes: 
1. To assist in providing equal educational opportunities for all 
the school children of the state. 
2. To assist in establishing certain accepted minimum standards 
for all the public schools of the state. 
3. To assist school districts whose tax levies for maintenance are 
exceptionally high. 
4. To stimulate educational progress by grants of state aid for 
 
-P-A-G-E-145
  FINANCING THE SCHOOLS 129 
superior efficiency and high standards and for desirable educa- 
tional undertakings not yet generally established. 
5. To provide for the maintenance of teacher training depart- 
ments in high schools. 
State Aid for Equalizing Educational Opportunities—1. For 
transportation of pupils in consolidated school districts, the state 
shall reimburse such districts at rates to be determined by the State 
Board of Education, provided no consolidated school district shall 
receive annually more than four thousand dollars for the transpor- 
tation and board of pupils for each consolidated school in such dis- 
trict. Provided further that state aid for transportation shall not 
be withheld from any consolidated district by reason of the require- 
ments of section 10 of chapter 238 of the Laws of 1915 (Industrial 
work). 
2. For school buildings in consolidated school districts, the state 
shall pay forty per cent of the cost of construction of such building, 
but not to exceed six thousand dollars to any such school district 
for each such building. 
4. For the tuition of non-resident high school Se the state 
shall pay to the school district furnishing such high school instruc- 
tion at the rate of seven dollars per school month, or major fraction 
thereof, for each such non-resident pupil, for not to exceed ten 
months in any school year, provided that high school instruction 
shall mean instruction for pupils who have completed the eight 
years of the elementary course; and that such tuition shall be paid 
by the state only insofar as any pupil’s residence district does not 
give high school instruction, but this provision shall not apply to 
non-resident pupils residing in unorganized territory, and that the 
state apportionment for any such non-resident high school pupils 
shall be paid to the school district in which such non-resident pupils 
attend a high school. Provided, that in all cases where such non- 
resident pupil is a resident of a state aided rural district the amount 
provided by the provisions of this act shall by the disbursing board 
be deducted from the aid otherwise going to such rural districts in 
cases where such aided rural school does not levy at least four mills 
or more upon the property of such district for school purposes. 
5. Any school district may receive aid for the purchase of library 
books on the basis of twenty dollars for each teacher employed with 
a maximum of forty dollars for each school building in the district, 
provided the district appropriates a like amount for the same 
purpose.

  130 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
State Aid to Assist in Establishing Minimum Standards — 
1. For each graded elementary school of eight school years with 
school year of at least nine months, the state shall pay a school 
district four hundred dollars annually. 
2. For each graded elementary school of six years with school 
year of at least nine months, the state shall pay a school district 
three hundred dollars annually. 
3. For each ungraded elementary school with a school year of at 
least eight months, the state shall pay a school district one hundred 
fifty dollars for each first grade teacher employed and one hundred 
dollars for each second grade teacher employed; for a school year 
of at least seven months, the state shall pay three-quarters of the 
aid provided for a school with a school year of eight months; pro- 
vided that the total of such aid for an ungraded school shall in no 
case exceed the three hundred dollars. 
4, For each four year high school with a school year of at least 
nine months, the state shall pay a school district one thousand 
dollars annually. 
5. For each high school department with a school year of at least 
nine months, the state shall pay a school district four hundred dol- 
lars annually. 
6. For each junior high school with a school year of at least nine 
months, the state shall pay a school district three hundred dollars 
annually. 
7. For each senior high school with a school year of at least nine 
months, the state shall pay a school district six hundred dollars 
annually. 
To Assist School Districts with High Tax Levy.— 
School districts which receive aid under the provisions of this 
section will be limited to those whose tax levy for maintenance only 
exceeds twenty mills. To any such district in which a tax levy of 
twenty mills does not yield the equivalent of forty dollars for each 
pupil who has attended the public school of such district at least 
forty days during the school year, the state shall pay as supple- 
mental aid an amount which, together with the proceeds of a twenty 
mill tax will give each such school district the equivalent of forty 
dollars for each such pupil. In school districts maintaining only 
ungraded elementary schools, if a twenty mill tax levy does not 
raise the equivalent of six hundred dollars for each teacher em- 
ployed for at least seven months during the school year, then the 
State Board of Education at its discretion may grant to such school 
district an amount, which together with the proceeds of a twenty 
mill tax levy, will give such school district the equivalent of six 
hundred dollars for each teacher employed as herein provided, but
-P-A-G-E-147
  
FINANCING THE SCHOOLS 131 
such state aid shall in no case exceed the equivalent of two hundred 
dollars for each teacher employed, but shall be in addition to all 
other state aid, including supplemental aid as otherwise provided in 
this section. . . . 
State Aid to Stimulate Educational Progress. — 
1. For established undertakings, state aid shall be granted to 
school districts on the basis of the number of special teachers em- 
ployed, enrolment in classes and type of work done, and all under 
such rules as may be established by the State Board of Educa- 
ete 
a. For agriculture state aid to any school district for each school 
within the district maintaining such work shall not exceed 
eight hundred dollars. 
For general industrial training state aid to any school district 
for each school within the district maintaining such work shall 
not exceed five hundred dollars. 
c. For home training state aid to any school district for each 
school within the district maintaining such work shall not ex- 
ceed five hundred dollars. 
d. For commercial training state aid to any school district for 
each school maintaining such work shall not exceed five hun- 
dred dollars. 
. For special classes for defectives. . . . 
. For stimulating progress and achievement in ungraded elemen- 
tary schools, the State Board of Education shall adopt stan- 
dards for a superior ungraded school. Such standard shall be 
based upon the length of term, qualifications of teachers, regu- 
lar school attendance and a curriculum adapted to present day 
needs, including health work. School districts meeting these 
standards shall receive, in addition to all other state aid, not 
to exceed one hundred twenty-five dollars for each such school 
maintained. 
. For evening schools . . . one-half the salaries of all teachers. 
. For teacher training in high schools the State Board of Educa- 
tion is hereby authorized to establish rules and to determine 
the amounts of state aid to be granted to any school district 
for the maintenance of this work. Such state aid shall be 
determined upon the basis of one, two, or three teacher depart- 
ments respectively... . 
State Aid to Consolidated School Districts — 
1. For receiving state aid for transportation, schools in consoli- 
dated districts shall be in session for at least eight months in the 
year and be well organized. They shall have suitable school houses SP 
Oo a 
) 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
  182 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
with the necessary rooms and equipment. The board in a con- 
solidated school district shall arrange for the attendance of all 
pupils living two or more miles from the school through suitable pro- 
vision for transportation or for boarding and rooming such pupils as 
may be more economically and conveniently provided for by such 
means. 
2. In addition to the annual aid consolidated schools shall receive 
an amount to aid in the construction of buildings, equal to forty per 
cent of the cost of such buildings, but no school shall receive more 
than a total of six thousand dollars for aid.

In connection with state expenses it should be remembered that 
the revenues derived from gross earnings, inheritance, and other 
special taxes, supplemented by departmental fees have been more 
than sufficient for some years past to defray the ordinary expenses 
of state government, state institutions, and purely state activities. 
If the legislature made no appropriations in aid of public schools, 
 
-P-A-G-E-149
  FINANCING THE SCHOOLS 133 
this alone would make it unnecessary to levy any tax for the state 
revenue fund. However, if this were done, it would be necessary for 
most of the districts of the state to increase local taxes to meet the 
loss sustained through the withdrawal of state aid; consequently in 
the end the amount of the tax would not be reduced; it would simply 
transfer the levy from the state to the local districts.

4, Extracts from the Report of the Superintendent of 
Education to the Department of Education of Minnesota, 
1921-1922: 
Minnesota’s educational system has been built on the principle of 
large local autonomy. The state has recognized the proprietorship
-P-A-G-E-150
    134 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
of each community in its own school and has sought by methods of 
state support and direction to capitalize local interest in education, 
so as to build up the school as a community institution. 
The state has set up standards and objectives towards which it 
has directed the efforts of the schools by offers of special state aid. 
. . The act which created the State Board of Education, chapter 
334, Laws of 1919, required that it make an exhaustive study of 
state support and present constructive recommendations as a part 
of its first biennial report. This was done and on the basis of the 
Report of the State Board of Education upon the Revision of State 
Aid, the legislature in 1921 passed a new law defining the purposes 
and governing the distribution of state support. . 
A new and valuable feature under the provision for establishing 
minimum standards is that which gives aid to elementary graded 
schools separately from high schools, thus laying emphasis on the 
importance of elementary education. 
One of the most progressive features of the new law is that for 
assisting school districts with a high tax levy for maintenance. 
While the plan existed under the old law, its limitations were such 
as to make it of little value. This provision recognizes the unequal 
distribution of wealth and is based on the doctrine that the educa- 
tion of every child, wherever he may live in the state, is a charge 
against the wealth of the state... . 
Not all of the specific purposes recommended by the State Board 
of Education were accepted by the legislature, nor were the amounts 
provided identical with those suggested in the Board’s report. 
Those not accepted were for supervision in rural schools, part-time 
classes, health and physical education and community service. For 
most purposes which it accepted, the legislature increased mate- 
rially the amounts recommended by the Board, reducing only a 
few, and those but slightly. 
The principal increase which the legislature made over the 
Board’s recommendations were high school tuition from $5.00 per 
month to $7.00; flat aid for four year high schools from $800.00 to 
$1,000.00; ungraded school aid from $75.00 per teacher to $150.00; 
building aid for consolidated schools from $2,000.00 to $6,000.00; 
special classes for the deaf from $150.00 to $250.00 per pupil; the 
addition of special classes for crippled children at $250.00 per child, 
and aid for school libraries raised from $10.00 per teacher and a 
maximum of $25.00 per building to $20.00 per teacher and a maxi- 
mum of $40.00 per building. The increase made by the legislature 
over the amounts recommended by the Board exceeded the reduc- 
tions or rejections by about $500,000 for the year just closed. No

statement in law of amounts and specific purposes of aid can be 
regarded as permanent. Further considerations and experiences will 
doubtless show the need of readjustment. Some new aids will be 
added and eventually some will be dropped. The general purposes, 
however, are sound and should continue. 
The amount estimated for special aid by the Department of 
Education and appropriated by the legislature for the school year 
1921-1922, the first under the new law, was $3,635,452.00. This 
estimate was necessarily based on the terms of the old law, since 
the new was not passed until late in the session and its terms could 
not be anticipated. Again, the amounts of aids for the several pur- 
poses named in the law were larger than expected. The item farth- 
est above the estimate is that for aid to districts with excessive tax 
rates. This was estimated on the basis of 1918 tax rates at about 
$390,000.00 and has run above $1,300,000.00 due to the greatly in- 
creased rates of local taxation. The aggregate result is a very large 
deficit in the appropriation made to meet the claims of the schools 
under the terms of the new law. This will be cared for in part by a 
balance of approximately $200,000.00 carried over from the previous 
year and by a transfer made on the recommendation of the State 
Board of Education of $300,000.00 from the current school fund to 
the special state aid fund, as authorized by the law. In this connec- 
tion it should be noted that under the old law certain aids now paid 
from the special state aid fund were paid from the current school 
fund, which, if paid from it this year, would amount to $242,128.00. 
It will still be necessary under the terms of the appropriation act to 
prorate the payment of the special state aid on the basis of 74 per 
cent of the amounts due the school under the new law. 
The question of the amount of state support that shall be given 
and the basis on which it shall be distributed, will always be one of 
controversy. The mounting cost of education presents a demand on 
the state to increase its contribution, if the percentage of the state 
support is to continue as high as in the past. The state’s share in 
all expenditures, including the bonds and interest as well as 
maintenance for elementary and high schools is shown in the follow- 
ing table through a term of years. In the columns, “Special State 
Aid” and “Total State Aid” below, are shown for the year 1922, 
both the amounts that the schools should have under the terms of 
the law and the amounts actually paid because of the shortage in 
appropriations. The two percentages given correspond likewise.

Assignment 
1. Does it appear from the data that expenditures for schools 
in the state are excessive and that the amount should be 
greatly reduced? 
2. Does it appear that the amount of aid given by the state 
to the schools is excessive and should be decreased?

3. If you were the state commissioner of education in this 
case, what would be your attitude before the committees of the 
legislature? What proposals, if any, would you make with 
respect to the state’s part in the support of its public schools? 
4, If you were a city superintendent in this state, what 
would you consider the proper attitude to take for the best 
interests of the schools of the state? 
5.-If you were the president of the state association of 
teachers, what action do you think you would be justified in 
taking in this situation? 
6. What features in the scheme of state aid of this state do

PROBLEM 17 
STATE AID 
Problem: A committee of a state superintendents’ association 
has been appointed to work with the state department in the 
formulation of a more adequate state aid program. This state 
now has a system very similar to that of N. K. What can the 
committee learn from the recent legislation in Maryland and 
New York? 
Excerpt from the N. K. Law—1921: 
Section 11179: Apportionment of public school fund. The state 
superintendent of public schools shall annually, before August 15th, 
apportion the public school fund applied for the benefit of the public 
schools among the different counties. This apportionment shall be 
made as follows: The state superintendent shall apportion, among 
the various counties, fifty dollars for each teacher, each principal, 
and each supervisor actually employed for the entire term: Pro- 
vided, that any teacher employed for less than one-half of the day 
shall not be counted; any teacher employed for less than one-half 
of the term for which school is maintained in the district shall not 
be counted; for each teacher employed for more than one-half of the 
school term of the district and less than nine-tenths of the school 
term, he shall apportion only twenty-five dollars: Provided, also, 
that he shall apportion only twenty-five dollars for the teacher of 
any district in which the average attendance during the year preced- 
ing the apportionment has been less than fifteen pupils per day: 
Provided further, that he shall apportion one hundred dollars for 
each teacher whose salary is one thousand dollars or more per year: 
Provided that he shall apportion fifty dollars for each teacher of 
any district that employs only two teachers, one of whom is colored 
and one white: Provided that no teacher, principal, or supervisor, 
who is not paid by the school board from the public funds of the 
district shall be counted. After these teacher apportionments have 
been deducted the remainder of the state school fund to be appor- 
tioned shall be divided by the total number of days’ attendance of 
all the pupils of the public schools of the state and the quotient thus 
145
-P-A-G-E-162
  146 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
obtained shall be called a pupil daily apportionment. The amount 
apportioned to each district shall be determined by multiplying this 
pupil daily apportionment by the total number of days’ attendance 
of all pupils of each district: Provided, that the days’ attendance 
on legal holidays and on days when the school is dismissed by order 
of the board to permit teachers to attend teachers’ meetings shall be 
determined by counting as present each pupil who was present on 
the last day the school was in session before such intermission. The 
clerk of each school district shall make a report to the county clerk 
between June 15th and June 30th of each year, showing the number 
of teachers employed, the total number of days’ attendance of all 
pupils, the length of the school term, the average attendance, the 
number of days taught by each teacher, the salary of each teacher, 
and any other information that the state superintendent may 
require. The aforesaid report shall be sworn to before a notary 
public or the county clerk. The county clerk shall make a sum- 
mary of all these reports and forward to the state superintendent 
of public schools, on or before July 15th, a report showing the total 
number of teachers employed in the county and the total number 
of days’ attendance of all pupils in the county, the number of 
teachers employed for the full term, and the number for half 
terms, and the number whose salary is one thousand dollars or 
more per year, and such other information as the state superin- 
tendent may require. Any district clerk, county clerk, or teacher 
who shall knowingly furnish any false information in such reports, 
or neglect or refuse to make aforesaid report shall be deemed guilty 
of a misdemeanor and punishable by a fine not exceeding five hun- 
dred dollars or imprisonment in the county jail for a term not 
exceeding six months or by both such fine and imprisonment. 
Excerpt from the Maryland Law—1922: 
Article 133: All money appropriated, subsequent to the enact- 
ment of this section, by the General Assembly of the State of 
Maryland and the receipts from any State public school tax 
levied by the General Assembly, to aid in support of public 
schools, shall constitute what shall be known as the General 
State School Fund. The Comptroller shall charge against and 
pay as hereinbefore or hereinafter provided from the General State 
School Fund, the annual appropriation made by the General Assem- 
bly for the support of the State Department of Education, including 
the expenses of the State Board of Education, and the support and 
expenses of the office of the State Superintendent of Schools; the 
annual appropriation for the maintenance and support of the state

normal school at Towson, of the state normal school No. 2 at Frost- 
burg, and of the state normal school No. 3 at Bowie, the annual ap- 
propriation for retired teachers’ pensions; the annual appropriation 
for state aid to approved high schools; the annual appropriation for 
state aid to approved colored industrial schools; the annual appro- 
priation for part payment of the State of the salaries of county 
superintendents and of the Superintendent of Schools of Baltimore 
City, and of supervising teachers or helping teachers, in each of the 
several counties and the City of Baltimore; the annual appropria- 
tion for payment by the State of the entire salary of one attendance 
officer in each of the several counties and the City of Baltimore; the 
annual appropriation for the purchase of textbooks, material of 
instruction and school supplies; such special appropriations to be 
known as the Equalization Fund, as may, from time to time be made 
by Budget Bill or Supplementary Appropriation Bill, to the county 
boards of education of certain counties to enable them to pay the 
minimum salaries prescribed in this Article for county superin- 
tendents, supervising teachers and helping teachers, high school and 
elementary school teachers, and teachers in colored schools; pro- 
vided, that the board of county commissioners of each of the several 
counties sharing in the Equalization Fund shall levy and collect an 
annual tax for the schools of not less than sixty-seven (67) cents on 
each one hundred dollars ($100) of assessable property, exclusive of 
the amount levied for debt service and capital outlay for the schools; 
provided, further, that in any county, all funds which the county 
board of education may be authorized to expend for the schools, 
other than State appropriations, and exclusive of the amount au- 
thorized to be expended for debt service and capital outlay, may, for 
the purpose of the above proviso, be considered as levied by the 
board of county commissioners, irrespective of the source or sources 
from which such funds may be derived; and provided, further, that 
the county board of education in each of the several counties shar- 
ing in the Equalization Fund shall expend no less than twenty-four 
per centum (24%) of the total budget, not including debt service 
and capital outlay, for purposes other than teachers’ salaries. But 
no special appropriation to any county, except as heretofore in this 
section provided, or to any academy, or to any college or university 
may be paid from the General State School Fund. 
Article 188: After all deductions are made from the general state 
schools fund as provided for in section 188 of this article, the Comp- 
troller shall apportion on or before the last day of September the 
remainder of the general state school fund of each year to the several 
counties and the City of Baltimore, as follows: Two-thirds shall  
-P-A-G-E-164
  148 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
be apportioned on the basis of the population between the ages of 
six and fourteen years as given by the Federal Census of 1920, which 
shall be the basis until 1924, after which time by annual school 
census as provided in section 21-B, 25-M, and 75 of the article; and 
one-third shall be apportioned upon the basis of the aggregate days 
of school attendance during the preceding school year as certified by 
the State Superintendent of Schools; provided that the attendance 
of pupils in a state-aided high school shall not be counted in appor- 
tioning the general state school fund. 
Plan Used by Maryland State Department to Distribute 
Aid under Article 133: 
A. General Basis for Computation: 
1. Total budget for current expenses required to carry minimum 
requirements of 1922 School Law. 
2. Estimated total receipts from state and from county tax 
derived from 67 cent rate on each $100 of assessed valuation 
of real and personal property in county. 
3. Equalization Fund equals 1 minus 2. (See Md. School Laws, 
1922, Sec. 133, p. 97) 
B. Details of Computation: 
1. Total budget for current expenses required was obtained as 
follows: 
a. Actual annual pay roll for salaries of teachers and prin- 
cipals as of October, 1921. 
b. Deduction for number of teachers in excess of an allow- 
ance of one for each 40 children in average attendance in 
individual school over a period of years. (See Md. School 
Laws 1922, Sec. 47, p. 33.) 
c. Increase required to bring salaries to new 1922 minimum 
salary schedule * on basis of certification and experience of 
teachers. Any county paying more than new 1922 mini- 
mum schedule had reduction made accordingly. Pro- 
vision made for increased salaries for estimated raise in 
grade of certificate of teachers and for replacement of 
teachers with lower grade certificates by those with a 
higher grade. (See Md. School Laws, 1922, Sec. 60, 126, 
132A, 132B; pp. 45-48, 89-90, 93-96.) 
d. Total salary budget, estimated as a plus b plus c, was to 
be at least 76% of total current expense budget (basis for 
this was 1920-21 experience). 
  * Practically all of the counties sharing in the Equalization Fund were paying 
salaries lower than the new minimum salary schedules.

Excerpt from the New York Law—1925: 
Article 18. 
Section 490: When apportioned and how applied. The amount 
annually appropriated by the Legislature for the support of com- 
mon schools shall be apportioned by the Commissioner of Educa- 
tion on or before the twentieth day of January in each year as 
hereinafter provided; and all moneys so apportioned shall be ap- 
plied exclusively to the payment of teachers’ salaries. 
Section 491: Apportionment of moneys appropriated for the sup- 
port of common schools. After setting apart therefrom for a con- 
tingent fund not more than ten thousand dollars, the Commissioner 
of Education shall apportion the money appropriated for the sup- 
port of common schools: 
1. To each city and to each union school district which has a 
population of five thousand and which employs a superintendent 
of schools, eight hundred dollars. This shall be known as a super- 
vision quota. 
2. To each district having an assessed valuation of forty thous- 
sand dollars or less, two hundred dollars. 
3. To each district having an assessed valuation of forty 
thousand dollars or less, but exceeding twenty thousand dollars, one 
hundred and seventy-five dollars. 
4. To each district having an assessed valuation of sixty 
thousand dollars or less, but exceeding forty thousand dollars, and 
to each Indian reservation for each teacher employed therein for a 
period of one hundred and eighty days or more, one hundred fifty 
dollars (Subdivision 4, amended by L. 1917, ch. 74, in effect 
March 20, 1917.) 
5. To each of the orphan asylums which meet the conditions 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
  152 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
mentioned in article 35 of this chapter, one hundred and twenty- 
five dollars. 
6. To each of the remaining districts and to each of the cities 
in the State one hundred twenty-five dollars. The apportionment 
provided for by subdivisions 2, 8, 4, 5 and 6 shall be known as 
district quotas. 
7. To each such district, city and orphan asylum for each ad- 
ditional qualified teacher and his successors by whom the com- 
mon schools have been taught during the period of time required 
by law, one hundred dollars. The apportionment provided for by 
this subdivision shall be known as the teachers’ quota. 
8. To a school district or a city which has failed to maintain 
school for one hundred eighty days or which has employed an extra 
teacher for a shorter period than one hundred eighty days such part 
of a district or teacher’s quota as seems to him equitable when the 
reason for such failure is in his judgment sufficient to warrant such 
action; but in case such failure to maintain a school in such district 
or city for a period of one hundred eighty days was caused by the 
prevalence of an infectious or contagious disease in the community, 
the Commissioner may in his discretion apportion to such district 
or city full district and teachers’ quotas (Subdivision 8 amended 
by L. 1917, ch. 74, in effect March 20, 1917.) 
9. To each separate neighborhood such sum as in his opinion it 
is equitably entitled to receive upon the basis of distribution es- 
tablished by this article. 
10. All errors or omissions in the apportionment whether made 
by the Commissioner of Education or by the school Commissioner 
shall be corrected by the Commissioner of Education. Whenever a 
school district has been apportioned less money than that to which 
it is entitled the Commissioner of Education may, by an order 
under his hand, direct such moneys to be paid back into the hands 
of the county treasurer by him to be credited to the school fund, or 
he may deduct such amount from the next apportionment to be 
made to said district. 
11. The Commissioner of Education may also in his discretion 
excuse the default of a trustee or a board of education in employing 
a teacher not legally qualified, legalize the time so taught and 
authorize the payment of the salary of such teacher.

in districts having an assessed valuation of twenty thousand 
dollars or less, the sum of (three) six dollars for each entire

less than one hundred thousand dollars. 
4. The apportionments of additional teachers’ quotas provided 
for in this section or in section four hundred and ninety-one-b 
of this chapter are for the purpose of aiding city, union free and 
common school districts in paying the increased salaries of teachers 
as (herein) provided by chapter six hundred and eighty of the laws 
of nineteen hundred and twenty and the cost of school maintenance, 
and the sums so apportioned to such city, union free and common 
school districts shall be applied for such purpose and such sums 
shall not in any case be placed in the city treasury of any city to 
the credit of the general fund of such city for the reduction of 
taxation therein, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary 
contained in the charter of such city or in any act relating to such 
city or in any general, special or local act. 
Section 2. Article 18 of such chapter twenty-one of the 1s of 
nineteen hundred and nine, as so amended, is hereby amended by 
inserting therein a new section, to be known as section four hundred 
and ninety-one-b and to read as follows:— 
Section 491-b. Additional apportionments for certain districts. 1. 
In addition to all other quotas and apportionments of public school 
money provided for in this chapter, there shall be apportioned and 
paid to each city and union free school district or other district 
organized and established as provided by law, in each of which dis- 
tricts there shall be maintained a high school or academic depart- 
ment approved by the state education department, the sums to be 
determined by the Commissioner of Education as hereinafter pro- 
vided. Such additional quotas and apportionments shall also be 
apportioned and paid to districts not maintaining an academic de- 
partment or high school which employ five or more elementary 
teachers and provide adequately, with the approval of the Com- 
missioner of Education, for the academic instruction of pupils who 
have completed the work of the elementary grades. Such additional 
quotas shall be known as equalization quotas. The sums to be 
apportioned to each of such districts shall be determined as follows:
-P-A-G-E-171
  FINANCING THE SCHOOLS 155 
There shall be deducted from the total sum of twelve hundred 
dollars on account of each elementary school teacher plus the sum 
of sixteen hundred dollars on account of each high school teacher 
in the public schools of each such city and district, an amount 
equal to the total of all sums apportioned and paid out of public 
school moneys to each such city and school district for the year for 
which the apportionments authorized by this act are made, plus 
an amount equivalent to a dollar and fifty cents on each one 
thousand dollars of actual valuation of taxable property within 
such city or district. The balance remaining after such deduction, 
if any, shall be apportioned and paid to each such city or school 
district in the same manner and at the same time as are other ap- 
portionments of public moneys under this chapter. The actual 
valuation of taxable property shall be ascertained by taking the 
assessed valuation of such property as it appears upon the last 
assessment roll of the town or city in which such property is located, 
after revision as provided by law, and by applying thereto the ratio, 
as determined by the state tax commission, which such assessed 
valuation bears to the actual valuation of such property. 
2. The number of elementary and high school teachers which is 
made the basis of the distribution of the equalization quotas as 
herein provided shall be determined by the Commissioner of Edu- 
cation in the following manner: 
In a district having an average daily attendance of more than 
one hundred and thirty-five in grades one to eight, inclusive, one 
teacher shall be counted for each twenty-seven of such pupils in 
average daily attendance. In districts having an average daily 
attendance of one hundred and thirty-five or less in grades one to 
eight inclusive, two teachers shall be counted for the first forty 
of such pupils in average daily attendance, and one teacher for 
each thirty-two pupils in excess of forty. The pupils enrolled in 
special classes organized under Sections five hundred and seventy- 
eight and ten hundred and twenty of this chapter shall not be in- 
cluded in computing the average daily attendance, and the teachers 
employed to teach such special classes shall be included in the 
number of elementary teachers to be computed as herein provided. 
In a district having an average daily attendance in a high school 
or academic department of thirty-five or more, three high school 
teachers shall be counted for the first thirty-five or more, three high 
school teachers shall be counted for the first thirty-five of such 
pupils in average daily attendance, and one teacher for each ad- 
ditional twenty-two pupils in average daily attendance. In districts 
having an average daily attendance in a high school or academic

department of less than thirty-five, two teachers shall be counted 
for the first twenty of such pupils in average daily attendance, and 
one teacher for each additional fifteen pupils. 
If the number of elementary or. high school teachers employed is 
less than the number as above computed, and no adequate provision 
is made for the instruction of such pupils, the Commissioner of 
Education may in his discretion use the actual number of teachers 
employed, or any intermediate number between such actual num- 
ber and the number determined as above computed, in ascertaining 
the amount of state aid to be apportioned as provided in this sec- 
tion. The board of regents may, on and after August first, nine- 
teen hundred and twenty-seven, adopt a rule changing the ratios 
to be used in determining the number of elementary and high school 
teachers as a basis on which the amount of state aid is to be 
allotted under this section. The amount apportioned to each city 
or district under this section shall not be greater than the amount 
of the excess of the total expenditures for school purposes in such 
city or district above the aggregate of the amount which would re- 
sult from a tax of five mills on each dollar of actual valuation of the 
taxable property in such city or district and the public moneys ap- 
portioned to such city or district as provided by law.

2. In what fundamental ways is the N. K. plan surpassed 
by the Maryland plan? By the New York plan? 
3. How do the three laws compare in amount of discretion 
left to the state department? 
4, Which of the three methods of measuring educational 
need is most defensible? 
5. In applying the Maryland law, the number of teachers 
counted by a county in determining cost of carrying out the 
state requirements is not more than one to each 40 pupils in 
average daily attendance. How does this differ from the N. 
K. plan? The New York plan? 
6. Some teachers in Maryland may be paid according to law 
a salary less than half that of others. In determining the 
educational need of counties these salaries are used. In New 
York State much greater differences exist in salaries required 
by law, yet the New York law. does not consider these differ- 
ences in measuring educational need. All elementary teachers 
are considered at the same level—$1,200—and all high school 
teachers at $1,600. Which is the more defensible procedure? 
7. The minimum salaries established by Maryland law vary 
from $600 to $1,150 for elementary school teachers and from 
$1,150 to $1,550 for high school teachers. How does the mini-

count for the difference in the local contributions. 
9. The local contribution to the support of the $1,200-$1,600 
program in New York State is 1.5 mills, yet the bill requires

PROBLEM 18 
FINANCING SCHOOLS 
Problem: A financial crisis has developed in the public schools 
of Union City, a community of 28,000 people. A large deficit 
has been accumulated. The Board of Education has deter- 
mined that retrenchment is necessary. How can large savings 
be effected with least injury to the school service? 
The total true wealth for the city is 45 million dollars. The 
total true tax rate for all purposes is $1.60. The total tax 
rate for schools is 60 cents. The assessments are now on ap- 
proximately a 50 per cent basis. 
The school board believes the people of Union City want 
good schools. Acting on that belief the board several years ago 
adopted certain guiding principles as an educational program 
for the public schools of the city. It has not been possible thus 
far to make the entire program wholly effective, but much 
progress has been made in that direction. In the opinion of 
the members of the board these ten guiding principles consti- 
tute a minimum educational program for Union City: 
1. Professionally trained teachers in all the schools. 
2. Full-day sessions for all grades in all schools, for nine 
months a year. 
3. Properly lighted, heated, and ventilated classrooms. No 
basement rooms. 
. Maximum of 40 pupils per teacher in elementary schools. 
. Maximum of 30 pupils per teacher in the high school. 
. Sufficient instructional supplies—books, drawing mate- 
rials, pencils, paper, maps, charts, and so on—to make 
good teaching possible. 
. Enforcement of the Compulsory Attendance Law. 
. A junior high school for grades 7, 8 and 9. 
. Courses of study based on the proposition that it is the 
business of the schools to teach every pupil how to do 
better the desirable things he will eventually do anyway.

10. Enough expert supervision to make sure that the fore- 
going program is carried out effectively. 
The board is confident that the patrons of the schools would 
not be satisfied with a program that offered less in the way of 
educational service than this program offers. In fact there has 
been considerable demand for extension of school service— 
among other things a school nurse and special teachers for 
abnormal children. So far as the board knows there has never 
been a suggestion from any source that the public schools are 
attempting to do too much for the children of Union City. 
Being convinced that any reduction in the present educa- 
tional program will be unsatisfactory to the patrons of the 
schools and, what is far more important, unjust to the children 
of Union City, the board is exceedingly reluctant to admit 
that it will be impossible after this year to maintain the schools 
as they now are. 
Briefly told these are the facts: For five or six years the 
School District has been spending more than its income. The 
deficit which has been piling up steadily, now amounts to as 
much as a whole year’s income. At the close of this school 
year the District will have spent all of next year’s income. 
Next year the schools will have to operate on borrowed money. 
The District cannot borrow more than it can repay. 
The District has an income of about three hundred thousand 
dollars a year and current expenses of about four hundred 
twenty thousand dollars a year. The District must, therefore, 
reduce expenses by $120,000 a year or increase revenue by that 
amount. Thereisno alternative. The following budget shows 
the situation in more detail.

    PROBLEM 19 
PREDICTING THE CURRENT COSTS OF EDUCATION 
FOR A TEN-YEAR PERIOD 
Problem: The administrative staff of the schools of Denver, 
Colo., is engaged in the development of a school building pro- 
gram for that city. As a result of this survey it is planned to 
submit recommendations to the board of education for the 
financing of the program proposed. It is apparent, however, 
that there can be no adequate plan for the financing of a 
school system except as all costs are considered. The data 
which follow may be used as a basis for calculating costs dur- 
ing the years which lie immediately ahead. 
What techniques should be employed and what is the estim- 
ate of costs for each year of the next ten years? These are 
problems that confront the superintendent of schools. 
DATA UPON WHICH TO PREDICT SCHOOL COSTS IN DENVER 
In attacking this problem among the most important ele- 
ments to be considered are the following: 
1. A prediction of the number of pupils who will be enrolled 
in the school system for each succeeding year and their dis- 
tribution among the several divisions of the school system. 
2. On the basis of costs already known a forecast of costs 
for each of the several functions of school support: (a) gen- 
eral control; (b) instruction; (c) operation of the school 
plant; (d) maintenance of the school plant; (e) fixed charges; 
(f) auxiliary agencies; (g) debt service; (h) capital outlay. 
3. A forecast of the assessed valuation of property in Denver 
for the next ten years. 
4. The prediction of the probable tax rate to be required 
during this period of years.

for opportunity and evening schools so that such may be used in weighting the average 
daily attendance as predicted.

FINANCING THE SCHOOLS 171 
It will be noted in the tables given above that no distinction 
is made among salaries paid to teachers in different types of 
schools such as kindergarten, elementary, junior high and 
senior high schools. This is accounted for by the fact that 
Denver is operating upon a single salary schedule. It is un- 
doubtedly true that elementary teachers are to be found most 
commonly in the lower ranges of the salary scale due to the 
limited preparation and experience which they have had. It 
seems fair to assume that the single salary schedule will con- 
tinue to be used and that such distribution as is now 
found will correctly represent the case in the years which fol- 
low. It is possible under the single salary schedule that a con- 
siderable number of elementary school teachers will move up 
toward the maximum.

TO PREDICT THE FUTURE ASSESSED VALUATION OF DENVER 
In order to predict the assessed valuation of Denver for the 
period of the next ten years the estimated true valuation from 
1890 to 1924 is given. It is important to note that from 1902 
all the figures include the whole of Arapahoe County which 
was consolidated with the city of Denver that year making 
the county and city co-terminus.

  PROBLEM 20 
SCHOOL COSTS 
Problem: To determine the total cost of education in a city 
public school system. 
The city of Marlin, N. K., had a population in 1920 of 
21,000. The average daily attendance in the public schools in 
1923-24 was 4,219. During this year the Board of Education 
had a total expenditure of $698,258.48. Of this total ex- 
penditure, $27,461.25 went to the payment of interest on the 
indebtedness of $627,000 which was outstanding against the 
school plant. There were payments aggregating $59,183.99 
made for permanent improvements to the school plant and in 
paying off school bonds which came due during the year. 
There were 14 school buildings in the city. Their average 
age was 25 years. The “present value” of the school plant at 
the beginning of 1923-24 was divided as follows: Land, 
$374,834; buildings, $1,365,211; equipment, $187,550. Long 
term money was worth 41% per cent in this locality in 1923-24. 
Assignment 
1. What was the total cost of public education per pupil in 
average daily attendance in Marlin in 1923-24? 
2. What was the total expenditure per pupil in average daily 
attendance? 
3. What was the current expense per pupil in average daily 
attendance? 
4. What was the interest charge per pupil in average daily 
attendance? 
5. What was the cost of the depreciation of the school plant 
per pupil in average daily attendance? 
6. What per cent of the total cost required cash disburse- 
ments? 
7. How was the remainder of the total cost met?

PROBLEM 21 
FISCAL DEPENDENCE OF BOARDS OF EDUCATION 
  Problem: For the past two years you have been superin- 
tendent of schools in Allen City, a Great Lakes city of 32,000 
population. The city operates under a charter granted by the 
state legislature in 1889. 
Under this charter the Board of Education is required to 
submit an itemized budget of its estimated financial needs for 
the fiscal year beginning November first to the city Board of 
Finance before the first day of May preceding. At the same 
time, the Board of Finance receives the budgets of the eleven 
other departments of the municipal government. It is the 
duty of this board to consider the twelve budgets and to 
make detailed recommendations concerning each to the City 
Council by June 1. The council is empowered to adopt these 
budgets by a majority vote after making any changes it may 
desire either in the individual items or in the total amount 
of any budget. The mayor may veto the action of the council 
with respect to any budget; it requires a two-thirds vote of 
the council to pass a budget over his veto. 
The mayor has appointed you as one of the seven members 
of a commission which is to draft a new charter for Allen City. 
The state legislature is to be asked to grant this new charter 
when it next meets in regular session. 
Assignment 
1. What plan of control of the budget of the Board of Edu- 
cation will you recommend? 
2. What general theories of municipal and educational 
organization will you present in support of the plan you 
propose? 
8. If you consider the present plan unsatisfactory, what 
types of facts will you present as evidence to support your 
contentions?

4, Has fiscal dependence upon municipal control or fiscal 
independence of boards of education been associated with 
a. Sounder financial policies, 
b. Greater expenditures, 
c. More defensible distribution of expenditures, or 
d. More desirable educational returns 
in the two groups of cities using one or the other plan of 
fiscal control?

  PROBLEM 23 
NON-RESIDENT TUITION 
Problem: To ascertain tuition charges to be made for children 
who are non-resident in the school district. 
The city of Atkinson, N. K., 8,000 population, is a trading 
center for a large rural section. During recent years, it has 
also been developing as an industrial center, due to the activi- 
ties of the Chamber of Commerce, which has succeeded in 
having new factories located in the community. 
The high school building was built originally to house 
approximately 400 children. There are now 525 in attendance 
of whom 160 are non-resident children. There is much oppo- 
sition to the erection of a new high school building at the 
present time although the present building will not provide 
school accommodations beyond the present enrolment. 
In times past, the Board of Education felt that an annual 
fee of $50 for non-resident students would tend to bring 
more children to school and would also create further interest 
in the town as a trading center. A minority group on the 
Board of Education are now anxious to increase the non- 
resident charges to approximate the actual cost per student in 
the high school. For 1924-25, the cost per high school student 
in average daily attendance including non-residents was 
$110.24. The average daily attendance was 88 per cent of 
the total enrolment for that year. 
If the tuition charges are increased to the actual cost, the 
rural districts which have no high schools will refuse to pay, 
thus throwing the burden of payment upon the parents of 
these rural children. This will mean that many children will 
be prevented from attending high school.

  PROBLEM 24 E 
ESTABLISHING ECONOMIES IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
TEACHING PROGRAM 
Problem: For a number of years, in the city of Sanderson, 
N. K., the Board of Education has discussed at budget times 
the apparent excessive costs in the field of secondary educa- 
tion. Sanderson is a community of 100,000 people and has 
three senior high schools, the Hamilton, the Lafayette, and 
the Washington. The superintendent of schools became aware 
of the criticism being leveled at high school costs and at the 
first opportunity made an intensive analysis of the entire 
problem. He presented a report to the Board of Education 
which formed the basis for discussion in their first meeting 
in May, 1925. This report is presented below.

From: EE. W. Johnson, Superintendent 
Subject: Economies in Operating Expenses 
I. GENERAL STATEMENT 
It would be trite to say that schools might be administered with 
much less effort if one kept in view only desirable and adequate 
educational results and ignored the business aspects of the numerous 
policies and procedures which are necessary in the accomplishment 
of these results. While a satisfactory achievement of the former 
aim would require no small degree of insight into the technicalities 
of the profession, together with much energy and all of the necessary 
personal qualifications for success in the management of any large 
institution, the problem becomes increasingly intricate and interest- 
ing in proportion as one considers the factor of financial economy in 
its proper relation to educational outcomes. It is, therefore, the 
duty of the school superintendent to accept the responsibility for 
making continuously scientific studies of the various phases of 
school administration in order to effect the best adjustment of these 
two factors. Such an adjustment will mean the largest possible 
social benefit from the expenditure incurred.

    184 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
During the past two years, and more particularly since June 1921, 
I have been studying the whole question of our school programs as 
they have been developed during the past years with a view to 
establishing organization policies and operating methods that will 
effect financial economy and at the same time yield equal or in- 
creased educational values. As a result of this study, I wish to 
present for your information and consideration the following report, 
together with recommendations concerning certain general policies 
which I believe should be approved and adopted by the Board. 
II. ECONOMIES THROUGH REORGANIZATION 
A. How Effected 
The economies which I propose below may be effected through a 
skillful manipulation of school organization and school programs 
that will bring an equitable distribution of teaching responsibilities 
and at the same time insure equal or improved educational results 
among the pupils. 
B. High Schools 
1. Number of pupils per teacher—The table presented immedi- 
ately below covers an eight-year period beginning in 1917. In the 
first column is shown the number of teachers in the three high 
schools, in the second the number of students, and in the third the 
average number of pupils per teacher. The figures quoted are taken 
from reports as of October 15 in each year. The number of teachers 
equals the teaching personnel of the high schools minus the admin- 
istrative staff in the principal’s office which includes the principal, 
vice-principal, registrar, and stenographer.

It will be observed that there was a rather regular decrease in the 
number of pupils per teacher from 1917-18 to the school year of
-P-A-G-E-201
  
FINANCING THE SCHOOLS 185 
1923-24 inclusive, and that this school year, 1924-25, the average 
is equal to that of 1920-21 (23). The significance of this condition 
becomes somewhat more apparent when one determines the number 
of teachers who would have been on the high school staff in 1924-25 
if the average of 1917-18 had been maintained. In 1923-24, there 
were 4,303 students in the high schools. If the high school programs 
had been such as to maintain the 1917-18 average of 27 pupils per 
teacher, there would have been in our high schools in 1923-24, 159 
teachers instead of 208, which makes a difference of 42. In other 
words, looking at the situation solely from this point of view, it 
would have been possible to manage the high schools in 1923-24 with 
fewer teachers by 42 than were actually used if the 1917-18 distribu- 
tion of responsibilities among the teachers had been maintained. 
The organization policies underlying the high school programs in 
1923-24 were substantially those which had developed during the 
six preceding years. 
2. Reasons for the disproportional increase in teaching staff— 
Among the various reasons for the disproportional increase in the 
teaching staff, I am listing below a certain number which became 
effective during the period. 
a. Introduction of “home room” plan. The so-called “home 
room” plan was inaugurated in a rather thoroughgoing manner in 
the Washington and Lafayette High Schools. This plan involved 
the use of large study halls in which groups of pupils numbering 
from 80 or 40 to 200 were stationed during any part of the day when 
they were not engaged in regular classroom work. A teacher was 
in charge all of the time and was responsible for keeping many of 
the records of these students. This plan was in operation in the 
Lafayette High School until September, 1924. It had been aban- 
doned in the Washington High School previously. Through its 
abandonment at the Lafayette High School last September it was 
possible to take care of the additional number of students without 
increasing the teaching staff. It was expensive because teachers put 
in charge of these “home rooms” were receiving as much salary as 
any other teachers on the staff and also because they taught very 
few classes. I believe the “home room” teachers at the Lafayette 
High School taught an average of about two classes a day. We have 
substituted for this plan a program which involves the use of study 
halls as explained below. 
b. Assignment of regular teachers to study halls. It has been 
customary during certain years in all of the high schools, and 
especially since the abandonment of the “home room” plan which 
was excessively expensive, to assign regular teachers to study hall
-P-A-G-E-202
  
  186 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
duties. Here the teacher supervised the study of a number of 
students during one or two periods a day. In most instances this 
teacher was relieved of one period of regular classroom instruction. 
This plan is unduly expensive because it places at all times teachers 
whose abilities are worth more if used in other ways. This plan is 
in vogue in the Hamilton and Lafayette High Schools at the present 
time. If it were necessary to continue it, of course, it would be as 
efficient and more economical to place in charge of the study halls 
all of the time teachers who are qualified for the work but who at 
the same time receive much less salary than many of the regular 
teachers now assigned to this duty who are relieved of regular class- 
room instruction in order to take the responsibility. 
c. Permitting very small classes in certain third and fourth year 
subjects. An examination of the programs of the high schools dur- 
ing the past years will show that in certain subjects such as Spanish, 
French, Latin and Mathematics, the classes in the third and fourth 
years have been smaller than any program of economy can possibly 
justify. The classes have decreased in size because these are elective 
subjects and the beginning classes—that is, the first year classes in 
these subjects are usually not very large, but by the time the group 
reaches the third or fourth year of the study so many students have 
withdrawn that the classes have decreased in some instances to a 
very small number, perhaps eight or ten students. This can be 
remedied and in part is being taken care of this year by alternating 
the study of certain subjects by semesters or years. For example, 
Cicero is usually studied in the third year and Virgil in the fourth. 
Since there is no necessary sequence to the study of these transla- 
tions, the Latin students entering the junior year, let us say, this 
year will study Virgil with senior students. Next year, the Latin 
students entering the junior year will study Cicero with the senior 
students who this year as juniors have studied Virgil. In this way, 
we combine students classified in two different years of the course 
in the same class and subject and thus enlarge the group. This same 
plan will be used in other subjects. 
d. Duplication of teaching duties in certain departments. There 
have been times when teachers of some departments have given as- 
sistance to teachers of other departments with the same group of 
pupils. While this is not a very vital factor in determining costs, 
any such duplication should be eliminated. I think it has been 
quite usual for art teachers to give assistance to home economics 
teachers in certain problems of design. Obviously, the need here is 
to select teachers, if possible, who have the proper training in design 
or else so to organize the program as to interchange the time of these
-P-A-G-E-203
  FINANCING THE SCHOOLS 187 
teachers and keep it fully occupied with groups of proper size. Be- 
cause of the relatively small number of students studying one of 
these subjects at times, it may be necessary to develop programs 
which will permit the exchange of teachers between school buildings. 
e. Teachers of double-period subjects instruct too few students. 
There are several subjects in the school course which are usually 
called double-period subjects. This is because they require. very 
little or no preparation outside the class. These subjects are such 
as bookkeeping, manual training, home economics, mechanical draw- 
ing and art. It has been customary to assign teachers to three of 
these double-period classes during the day. For example, a teacher 
in home economics, art, or manual training, would be in charge of 
three classes each day which have usually averaged not more than 
18 or 20 students. This means that these teachers have instructed 
an average number of pupils per day or per week of about 18 or 20 
or a total number of different students equaling 54 or 60, whereas 
teachers of English, history, mathematics, etc., who have taught 
five single periods of work for which the pupils are expected to pre- 
pare outside and as a result of which these teachers have more out- 
side work to do themselves, have instructed an average of 
approximately 25 students during the day or week or a total of 
approximately 125. While it is not possible to make these two 
situations exactly parallel so far as the number of students is con- 
cerned, the disparity which has existed is too great and can be 
improved in two ways as follows: 
(1) Assign to the teachers of double-period subjects four 
double-periods each day instead of three, and 
(2) Slightly enlarge the size of some of these classes through 
a more skillful assignment of students electing these 
subjects. 
f. Lack of equitable distribution of pupils among teachers in gen- 
eral. In the absence of a clear definition of the distribution of the 
teaching assignment, sometimes called the “teaching load,” which 
would serve as a definite check upon the entire organization of the 
high school, vacancies caused through resignation have usually been 
filled and additional teachers employed to serve what was estimated 
as the probable increase in enrolment. This rather loose system 
has not been sufficiently exact to cause the most careful and scien- 
tific study of the entire problem of school organization involving as 
it does the various subjects offered, the size of classrooms, amount 
of equipment, election of subjects by students on the basis of their 
desires and aptitudes, and the combinations of abilities among 
teachers that will best meet this complex situation.

8. Regulations concerning high school teachers’ assignments.— 
Based upon all the facts available, we have developed what I believe 
to be a set of regulations that will secure the largest possible finan- 
cial economy of high school operation during the next school year 
within the limits of conditions favorable to satisfactory educational 
results. These regulations will also render as nearly uniform as 
possible not only with each high school but among the three high

  schools the distribution of teaching responsibilities. The regulations 
were developed in a series of conferences with the principals and as 
the result of discussion with all of the high school teachers in meet- 
ings conducted personally by the superintendent. 
a. The working day of a high school teacher exclusive of the 
luncheon period shall be eight 45-minute periods. During any 
of these periods teachers may be assigned to any instructional 
or non-instructional responsibilities. 
. Exclusive of the principal, vice-principal, girls’ adviser, 
registrar, librarian, stenographer and clerk, the average num- 
ber of pupils per teacher, based upon number belonging, shall 
equal at least twenty-eight (28) during the school year 1925-26. 
c. The student periods per week will be the basis for determining 
the number of students and classes assigned to a teacher. For 
example a teacher may be assigned 6 classes instead of 5 if 
this seems advisable, but the student periods per week will be 
the determining factor in the number in the classes. 
4. Application of the regulations concerning the high school 
teachers’ assignments to the three schools—The application of these 
regulations concerning high school teachers’ assignments to the three 
high schools is shown in Table 2. The calculations are made on 
the assumption that the students enrolled in the various subjects on 
February 10, 1925, will correspond fairly accurately to the probable 
number of students enrolled in the same subjects during the first 
semester of 1925-26. The figures show, therefore, in the second 
column under each school the number of teachers on the staff in 
April 1925 and in the third column the number of teachers that will 
be required under the new regulations. 
The figures in the summary indicate that if the enrolment in the 
high schools is approximately the same during the first semester of 
1925-26 as it was on February 10, 1925, it will be possible to operate 
the high schools with a staff of teachers reduced by 2714 as com- 
pared with the number on the staff in April, 1925. 
The application of the regulations as I have shown will result in 
a reduction of the high school staff by 2714 teachers. Several of the 
teachers in the high schools have already stated that for various 
reasons they do not desire positions in the Sanderson Schools next 
year. There are 91% of these. Added to these I am quite sure there 
will be a number of resignations within the next two or three months. 
Assuming that there will be 6 resignations and adding these to the 
914 who have already stated that they do not care to return, there 
will remain 12 teachers to be used in the upper grades of the ele- 
mentary schools. These teachers will be given the opportunity to o

accept positions in these grades which may be open if they desire to 
do so. Later perhaps during the next year or the following year as 
additional teachers are needed in the high schools, the teachers who 
take these positions in the upper grades can be returned to the high 
schools. 
It is obvious that in making the readjustments necessary with the 
reduced staff, great care must be exercised by the principals in re- 
taining teachers with such combinations of teaching abilities as will 
make possible the required maximum use of each teacher’s time. 
5. Financial saving in teachers’ salaries——The average salary of 
the high school teacher this year is approximately $1,875. A reduc- 
tion of the high school teaching staff, therefore, by 2714 teachers will 
result in a saving in high school operation of $50,562.50 during the 
school year of 1925-26 alone even though we use as a basis for this 
calculation the average salary of this school year and not the aver- 
age salary as it may be next school year. 
As shown above under Section 5, there will probably be 1514 of 
these 2714 teachers who will not return to the Sanderson Schools 
next year. Their average salary amounting to approximately 
$1,875 will mean an actual saving of $29,062.50. The 12 teachers 
who will probably remain to be transferred to the elementary 
schools will take the places of an equal number of teachers who 
could probably be employed to fill these vacancies at $1,500 each. 
This will mean a saving of $18,000. These two items combined, 
that is, $29,062.50 plus $18,000, equal $47,062.50, which will be the 
actual saving to the Sanderson School District through the applica- 
tion of the regulations concerning teachers’ assignments and the con- 
sequent transfer of certain teachers from the high schools to the 
elementary schools if the enrolment next year is not greatly in 
excess of the February 10, 1925, enrolment. Anticipating an in- 
crease during the second semester of next year which will make 
necessary the addition of six or eight teachers a conservative 
estimate of the final saving to the district from this reorganization 
policy may safely be placed at $42,000. 
Assignment 
1. What scientific evidence can you present showing that 
the number of pupils per teacher in high schools can be in- 
creased without injury to the educational program? 
2. Are there any advantages to the “home room” plan which 
have not been included in this report? Is there any evidence 
that these advantages outweigh the financial disadvantages 
indicated?

  192 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
3. What is the function of a study hall teacher? What pro- 
fessional preparation can a teacher make for study hall 
service? 
4, In what way can small classes of eight and ten students 
be justified in a high school program? 
5. What are the methods employed in preventing the in- 
clusion of small classes in the high school program? 
6. Comment upon the recommendation which suggests the 
exchange of teachers between school buildings. 
7. Discover from other sources whether teachers of double 
periods have, as a rule, a lighter teacher load. Is such a 
teacher load justifiable in bookkeeping, home economics or 
industrial arts? Is it justifiable in physics and chemistry? 
8. What studies have been made indicating what constitutes 
a reasonable teacher load? 
9. In what form should the facts of class enrolment and 
teacher load be available to make possible the changes recom- 
mended in this report? 
10. What is the practice in the United States concerning the 
working day of the high school teacher? What is the practice 
with reference to the length of periods and the number of 
periods? 
11. Would you recommend any change in the method of 
calculation of the teacher unit? 
12. In the third regulation, there is a variation in the num- 
ber of pupils per teaching period dependent upon the subject 
taught. Can you justify the variations as listed? 
13. Is the amount of money which the superintendent re- 
ports as saved a real saving or is there a possibility of this 
being a fictitious saving with a corresponding loss in the edu- 
cational returns? 
14, In making the adjustments for the teaching staff to con- 
summate the saving, does the superintendent violate any 
principles of personnel management? 
15. Comment upon the form and general character of this 
report. Is it typical of the kind of report that should be pre- 
sented to a board of education? 
16. What part should high school principals and the super- 
visors have in the preparation of such a report?

  PROBLEM 25 
BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION OF A CITY SCHOOL 
SYSTEM 
Problem: A detailed study of many school systems located in 
different parts of the United States shows a variety in prac- 
tice with respect to business administration. In some school 
systems the superintendent of schools is the “one chief execu- 
tive officer,” responsible to the board of education, to whom 
all other employees of the school system, including business 
executives, superintendents of buildings and others, are sub- 
ordinate. Other systems make provisions for two codrdinate 
executives, each responsible directly to the board of education 
with groups of employees responsible to each of the executives. 
In the case of disagreement between these officials the board 
of education acts as arbiter. 
Some state school codes make provision for more than one 
executive officer, that of Ohio being an instance in point. An 
influential educational administration journal with a national 
circulation has advocated the necessity for two executive offi- 
cers. The National Association of School Business Officials 
insists upon the complete divorce of the business from the 
educational department of a city school system. The student 
of educational administration needs to know the best type of 
organization for the administration of business affairs and the 
proper allocation of business activities among those officials 
of the Board of Education who are concerned with their 
administration. 
For convenience in the statement of facts city school systems 
may be classified into three divisions with reference to the 
types of organization for the administration of school business 
affairs, known respectively as the “unit,” the “dual,” and the 
“multiple” types. The “unit” type may be defined as that 
having one chief executive officer to whom all other employees 
197 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
  198 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
of the schools are definitely and specifically subordinate. The 
“dual” type is characterized by two absolutely independent 
executive officers each of whom has, as a rule, employees 
directly responsible to him, and each responsible only to the 
Board of Education. The “multiple” type is similar to the 
“dual” but is characterized by three, or more, executive officers 
absolutely independent of one another. 
The following excerpts from the Rules and Regulations of 
the Boards of Education of the cities indicated show these 
various types. 
1. THE “UNIT” TYPE 
The Rules and Regulations of the Detroit, Mich., Board of 
Education for 1924 provide: 
Sec. II. Superintendent 
The Superintendent of Schools shall be the executive officer of eu 
Board of Education. .. . 
He alone shall be directly responsible to the Board of Education 
for the efficient operation of all school functions of the Board of, 
Education. 
Sec. III. Business Manager 
The Business Manager shall be the Secretary of the Board and 
shall be directly responsible to, and under the direction of the 
Superintendent of Schools for the efficient construction, maintenance 
and operation of buildings, purchase, storage and distribution of 
supplies, and auditing and insuring of school property. — 
Sec. IV. Supervisor of Properties 
The Supervisor of Properties shall be directly responsible to the 
Business Manager of this Board for the maintenance, repair and 
alterations to school property. . . . 
Sec. V. Supervising Engineer 
The Supervising Engineer shall be directly responsible to the 
Business Manager of this Board for the maintenance and operation 
of the heating and ventilating plants and all mechanical and elec- 
trical equipment of the various schools, and for the cleaning of the 
various buildings. . . . 
Each executive officer of the Detroit schools is specifically 
charged with the efficient management of his department and 
can hire and discharge the employees of the department with 
whose oversight he is charged.
-P-A-G-E-215
BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION OF SCHOOLS 199 
The Rules and Regulations of the Akron, Ohio, Board of 
Education for 1924 provide: 
The Superintendent of Schools shall be the executive officer of the 
Board of Education and under its direction. . . . 
He shall be directly responsible to the Board of Education for 
the efficient operation of all school functions of the Board of 
Education. 
He shall have the sole power to nominate and to assign, transfer, 
promote and demote or suspend all assistant superintendents, 
supervisors, principals, teachers, and other employees of the Board 
of Education as hereinafter provided. .. . 
The Assistant Superintendents of Schools shall be directly respon- 
sible to the Superintendent of Schools. 
The First Assistant Superintendent shall have supervision of the 
Junior and Senior High School Grades and shall perform such other 
duties as shall be assigned to him from time to time by the Superin- 
tendent of Schools. 
The Second Assistant Superintendent of Schools shall be respon- 
‘sible for the efficient administration of the alteration, construction, 
repair, maintenance and operation of all buildings, and shall be 
custodian of all school property. . . . 
2. THE “DUAL” TYPE 
The Rules and Regulations of the Grand Rapids, Mich., 
Board of Education revised to 1924 have the following pro- 
vision: 
The affairs of the Board of Education shall be administered by 
two general departments known respectively as the educational de- 
partment and the business department. 
The Rules and Regulations of the Chicago Board of Educa- 
tion issued in 1922 provide: 
Chapter IV. Art. I “Composition of the.Education Department” 
The Superintendent of Schools, Assistant Superintendents, Dis- 
trict Superintendents, Supervisors, Board of Examiners, Special 
Teachers, Directors, Principals of Schools, and Teachers shall com- 
pose the Education Department. 
The Superintendent of Schools shall have general charge and con- 
trol, subject to the approval of the Board, of the Education Depart- 
ment and the employees therein, of the public schools.
-P-A-G-E-216
    200 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
Chapter V. Art. I “Business Department” 
The Business Manager shall have general charge and control, 
subject to the approval of the Board, of the Business Department 
and the employees therein. 
3. THE “MULTIPLE” TYPE 
The Rules and Regulations of the St. Joseph Board of Edu- 
cation contain the following very interesting regulation: 
The administration of the school affairs of the School District of 
the City of St. Joseph shall be divided into three departments; 
namely 1. Education; 2. Finance; 3. Maintenance; at the heads of 
which shall be respectively the Superintendent of Schools, the Secre- 
tary and Business Agent, and the Chief Engineer. (Adopted April, 
1916.) 
The Boston, Mass., Board of Education operates under the 
following regulations amended to 1924: 
Sec. 55. 1. 
The Superintendent shall be the executive officer of the Board in 
all matters relating to instruction and discipline in the schools. 
Sec. 90. 1. 
The Business Agent shall be the executive officer of the Board in 
charge of the accounts, receipt of income, preparation of pay rolls, 
purchase, storage and distribution of supplies, including printing, 
postage and the transportation of pupils. 
Sec. 97. 1. 
He shall keep a careful oversight of all expenditures and all costs, 
and shall call the attention of the Board to any expense which may 
seem to him unnecessary, wasteful, or in excess of proper require- 
ments. ... 
Sec. 118. 1. 
The School House Custodian shall be the executive officer of the 
Board in all matters relating to the care and custody of land and 
buildings used for school purposes. . . . 
Still other cases might be cited showing more than three in- 
dependent, codrdinate officers. The St. Louis city charter 
provides for five such officials. The cases cited above, how- 
ever, will be ample to show the methods of organization used 
by different communities in an endeavor to accomplish the 
same end—the education of children. 
The advocates of the “dual” and “multiple” types of control
-P-A-G-E-217
  BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION OF SCHOOLS 201 
contend that no one man can be sufficiently expert in the many 
phases of school administration to direct simultaneously the 
educational and the business activities of a great city school 
system. They hold, therefore, that a board of education must 
have at least two independent executives, each expert in his 
field, and each independent of the other. The advocates of the 
“anit” type contend, on the other hand, that there can be no 
administrative efficiency without a single executive head to 
whom all others are responsible. Since the business of the 
schools is to educate, it is argued that even business transac- 
tions must be subject to review by one who can judge of their 
effect on the educational program. 
The problem cannot be solved successfully without consider- 
ing fully the complicated nature of many of the business 
activities of a city Board of Education. It is true that no one 
man can cover the entire field in a large system; there must be 
“division of labor’ based on a clear conception of the work to 
be done. An analysis of activities listed in the Rules and 
Regulations of the Boards of many cities is added so that an 
allocation of these may be made among the officials of any 
organization set up. The classification is one of convenience 
only, and the items overlap in many instances.

  PROBLEM 26 
FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING 
Problem: In the summer of 1924, a new superintendent of 
schools was elected at Valleyburgh, N.S. He early desired to 
understand the financial status of the school system but found 
things considerably mixed. There was no evidence of the 
slightest dishonesty, but the books had not been kept so that 
he could do two things he had been accustomed to do else- 
where in his use of the N.E.A. uniform system of school ae- 
counting. These two things were to make cost comparisons 
within his system and between his system and other systems, 
and to make the reports requested by the U. S. Bureau of 
Education. 
He accordingly had to work with the facts available and to 
throw them into the correct forms. To do this, he had to decide 
how fine his classifications would be, and for this he had to 
consider the general school situation. The data he accumulated 
for this purpose are given below. The various exercises of this 
problem embody the steps he had to take. 
The object of this problem is to give the student an under- 
standing of the uniform system of school accounting approved 
by the National Education Association and the United States 
Bureau of Education, with a minimum of repetitious clerical 
work, 
It consists of three exercises or parts: 
Part I. Keeping the Voucher Register. 
“II. Distributing the Expenditures by Functions. 
“TIT. Keeping the Cash Book. 
Data on the general school situation at Valleyburgh ac- 
cumulated by superintendent are set forth on the following 
pages.

206 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
Population, 5,234 in 1924. 
The school plant consisted of four buildings, all adjoining: 
No. 1. A brick elementary school building housing 528 pupils 
of whom 60 first graders were on part time, and con- 
taining the home economics room, the art room and the 
assembly hall, all three of which were used by the 
whole school. 
No. 2. A frame residence remodeled to house 65 grade pupils, 
the nurse’s rooms and the offices of the superintendent 
and his secretary. 
No. 3. A frame residence recently remodeled to house 58 grade 
pupils. High School. A brick building housing 165 
senior high school students, 171 junior high school 
students, 121 sixth grade pupils and 15 pupils in the 
special or “opportunity” class, and containing the 
manual training quarters for the whole system. 
Each building has its own heating plant. A one hundred thousand 
dollar bond issue for a new elementary building had been voted in 
December, 1923. 
Textbooks were furnished by the district. 
The superintendent found the following salary schedule in 
the official papers of the previous year. (m=male):

There was no elementary principal, the superintentent doing what an ele- 
mentary principal would ordinarily have done. 
No. 9 gave one-fourth of his time to teaching and three-fourths of his time to 
the high school principalship. 
Nos. 3, 4 and 6 were found to have devoted about two-thirds of their time to 
the grades, and one-third to the high school. They did some teaching but it was 
impossible to find how much. 
Nos. 5 and 7 did nothing but teach, each devoting about two-thirds to the 
grades and one-third to the high school, notwithstanding they were called “super-

No. 8 served the whole school. 
All of the janitorial staff worked in all the buildings. The “Cleaners” 
worked but a few hours each day. In the books as previously kept, the fiscal 
year for school expenditures began on August 1 and the treasurer’s year on April 1. 
Both fiscal years were required by law.

  208 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
The problem in detail follows: 
PART I. KEEPING THE VOUCHER REGISTER 
Step 1. Mark and code for Ledger Entry, in the right 
hand column, according to the Case Handbook, the following. 
(For Ledger Entry Markings, see Case, pp. 10 ff. For Code 
suggestions, see pp. 8, 9, 20.) 
Notes: In actual systems, this marking and coding would be done 
either on the bills themselves or preferably on the Voucher Covers, 
see Handbook, pp. 2, 3. 
This exercise gives the practice in the preliminary step necessary 
if you keep your own books, or in the work you will have to do as a 
superintendent unless you have an unusually expert bookkeeper. 
The superintendent usually has to decide where many items are to 
be charged and the bookkeeper does the actual charging and keeping 
of the books.

212 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
  Step 3. Assemble the coded amounts from the preceding 
step, so that they may be entered on one line in the Voucher 
Register or in any of the other forms such as Form 8, Form 2, 
etc. Write out clearly on a sheet of paper just how you arrive 
at the amounts you will later put on the one line. 
Step 4. Enter on one line of the Voucher Register sheet 
the data from Step 3 and pin your sheet of explanations on 
the back. See explanations in Step 5 following. 
Step 5. Enter as many of the items from Part I, Step 1, 
as possible on your Voucher Register Sheet. After the first 
five of these items, pay no attention to the “Voucher Num- 
ber,” “Order,” and “Warrant” columns but use the other 
columns as necessary. 
Do not enter anything in the line marked “Appropriation.” 
This is intended to contain the amount appropriated in the 
budget for each item. By adding the expenditures, the re- 
mainder of the appropriation still available can be quickly 
determined. 
Notes:— 
The “Voucher” number refers to the numbering system for keep- 
ing track of all the facts relating to each transaction. The system 
calls for a voucher jacket which will hold the bill and all other 
documents concerning that particular transaction that must be filed 
in one place. These voucher jackets are folded so as to be filed 
vertically and are numbered consecutively on the outside for easy 
tracing. The inside of the voucher jacket contains a complete list 
of all code headings in the system so that all amounts covered by 
the transaction can be quickly distributed in accordance with the 
requirements of the system. After such a distribution in the voucher 
jackets, it is easy to copy off the items in the proper columns of the 
Voucher Register. 
The “Order” number refers to the numbering system for keeping 
track of orders for work or articles. Each order has its own number 
and is issued with varying numbers of carbon copies, one of which 
is kept in a central file in the school system. 
The “Warrant” number refers to the number of the warrant or 
official order of the Board for payment of the bill in question. Often 
many widely different items, possibly even all the items for one 
board session, may be included in one warrant. The warrants re- 
quire a numbering system of their own for tracing at any later time. 
After warrants are officially passed or signed, checks are issued to
-P-A-G-E-229
  
BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION OF SCHOOLS 213 
correspond. When several items occur in one warrant, each firm or 
person sending in a bill covered by that warrant, must have his 
separate check. Thus the check numbers do not correspond to the 
warrant numbers and the checks must have a separate system of 
their own. 
For the purposes of this exercise, the student needs to understand 
only the reasons for these four sets of numbering and to copy the 
correct numbers of but five items. Assigning numbers to the vouch- 
ers, orders, warrants and checks all the way through this exercise 
would not be worth the effort and time involved. 
Step 6. Add each column vertically. The total in the 
“Total” column should equal the sum of the totals in the 
columns to the right of it. 
To insure accuracy, all amounts on the same horizontal line 
may be added, or entered singly as the case may be, in the 
“Total” column. Then the vertical total of the “Total” 
column should equal the sum of the totals in the columns to 
the right of it. That is, the two sums obtained in different 
ways may be used to check each other. 
PART II. DISTRIBUTING THE EXPENDITURES BY FUNCTIONS 
(General Control, Instructional Service, etc.) 
Step 1. Enter in the proper places on Forms 2-9 inclusive, 
all the items entered in the Voucher Register. The easiest 
way will be to take them from the sheets where you coded 
them as the code marks will show which columns to use in 
Forms 2-9. 
Note that the “Code” column on these forms carries only 
the code designations in addition to the numbers for the forms 
and columns. Thus for an item which merely goes into Form 
2, Column 3, it is useless to put anything in the “code” 
column. That column would contain only the extra symbol 
necessary to show that the item was for high school, Building 
1, etc. 
Step 2. Add each column vertically. The total in the 
“Total” column should equal the sum of the totals in the 
columns to the left of it. 
Step 3. Compare the totals for Forms 2-5 with the corre- 
sponding totals in your Voucher Register. The corresponding 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  
  214 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
totals will be exactly the same if the work has been correctly 
done. 
PART III. KEEPING THE CASH BOOK 
Step 1. Draw up on large sheets, two forms like those for 
the Debit and Credit sides of the Cash Book, as given in the 
Case Handbook, page 1.

Deposited April 1, 1923, to April 1, 1924. 
Step 4. Enter the first six items from those listed on your 
Voucher Register Sheet. 
These are merely for practice and a clear understanding of 
the procedure. 
Step 6. Getting the Cash Balance. 
The superintendent finally, with the help of the Treasurer 
and Clerk of the Board, made up a cash balance for March 
31, 1924, in the following form: 
BANK BALANCE, MARCH 31, 1924

(Add) 
In making up the cash balance, he had the following data 
to use: 
The school system had $48,106.72 in cash in banks on Apr. 1, 1923. 
The cash in the First National Bank on March 31, 1924, was 
$146,735.54 and there were outstanding the following checks on 
this bank: 
1923, No. 9838 — $2,000.00 
1924, No. 210— 2,000.00 
473 — 45.00 
474 — 24.50 
476 — 5.00 
477 — 5.00 
On the same date the cash in the Second National Bank was 
$2,071.24 with no checks outstanding.

Directions to the student on Step 5: From the above data, 
make up the Bank Balance Statement, and the Cash Balance 
as of April 1, 1924, in the approved form. Note that the two 
sums of the Cash Balance must be the same, and that the 
Cash in Banks of the Cash Balance must be the same as the 
corresponding item in the Bank Balance statement above. 
  Assignment 
Mastery of accounting can result only where the student 
works through each step personally. Each student should 
acquire a set of accounting forms and work through each part 
of this problem. It may be desirable for students to form into 
committees of two or three, each committee submitting a final 
report. 
Does this problem allow for “advancements” or revolving 
fund?

  PROBLEM 27 
BUDGETARY PROCEDURE 
Problem: The budgetary procedure in Cary, N. T., has been 
criticized by members of the City Council. You have just 
been elected superintendent of schools. It is expected that 
you will reform the school administration in this as in other 
respects. 
Cary is a city of approximately 5,000 pupils, with a budget 
of $550,000, in which the school board is fiscally dependent 
although their charter provides that there be independence so 
long as the cost of public schools does not exceed $42 per capita 
on the basis of number enrolled. 
The business administration of schools is in the hands of 
the superintendent, who has two clerks. There is no system of 
annual and special requisitioning of textbooks, supplies and 
equipment worthy of the name. No cumulative budget record 
is maintained, no stock record either of textbooks or supplies, 
no textbook or supply distribution record, no principal’s an- 
nual textbook inventory nor principal’s supply inventory, no 
annual textbook summary and no annual supply summary. 
There is a card index of insurance policies carried on school 
buildings and contents filed by due dates on policies and cross- 
indexed by agents. A blotter or day book carries entries of all 
kinds of receipts which eventually are credited to the school 
account. On this blotter, in one month, items range from one 
of over $33,000 for state aid to $1.00 for the sale of honey, tui- 
tion for students at truant farms, sale of milk from the farm— 
amounting in total to over $34,000. This blotter or day book 
is the only record in the superintendent’s office of receipts, ex- 
cept the small receipt which the city treasurer gives in ac- 
knowledgment of the deposit of funds by the superintendent of 
schools. No adequate safeguards have been set up in the way 
of records in the superintendent’s office to insure to the city 
adequate accounting for either receipts or expenditures but 
217 
 
-P-A-G-E-234
    218 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
there is a distribution of expenditures’ ledger and a copy of last 
year’s budget in the minute book. Teachers’ contracts are also 
available, but there is little evidence available upon which to 
set up a budget which will insure the development of a plan 
of work and the control of that plan through the expenditures 
of the funds appropriated and revenues or receipts accruing to 
the system. 
The program of preparing the budget starts some time be- 
fore July 1, because on that date the Board of Education must 
submit to the Common Council the budget it has adopted. 
The routine includes a rough draft by the superintendent, con- 
ferences with the executive committee, the visiting committee 
and the teachers’ committee of the board. These completed, 
a final conference is held which includes the superintendent 
and the finance committee, after which the Board of Educa- 
tion, as a whole, adopts the budget officially. This document is 
passed on to the Common Council on July 1. At its leisure 
and convenience, the Common Council, together with the 
mayor and the city manager, give consideration to this docu- 
ment. Since it must be spread upon the tax books about the 
15th of August, the usual procedure is that the Common Coun- 
cil makes its cuts just prior to this date. Last year, they cut 
$16,000 from the total figure and returned the budget to the 
Board of Education. The usual dickering between the city 
and school officials results in the Board of Education accept- 
ing the $16,000 cut and redistributing the amounts which make 
up the curtailed budget. They pass the new budget and send 
it to the Common Council on or before August 15. The Com- 
mon Council acts on this final draft of the budget, and the city 
clerk, on or before September 1, certifies to the Board of Edu- 
cation a copy of the abbreviated budget indicating that the 
appropriation will be forthcoming. The following resolution 
of the Board of Education, dated July 10, 1923, shows the 
form in which the budget was submitted to the Common 
Council. 
Resolution passed July 10, 1923, by Commissioner R. S. 
Kane: 
Resolved, That the following items in detail of the expense and 
income of the Board of Education in its work for the next fiscal

  PROBLEM 28 
PAY ROLL PROCEDURE 
Problem: The procedure in handling pay rolls in your city 
was developed hy your predecessor. The city manager has 
been critical of this part of the school administration and sug- 
gests that it is indicative of the inefficiency of the school board 
and its executiv> officer. What is involved in adequate pay 
roll procedure? 
Although primarily an industrial center with diversified 
products, Arnolida is the outlet for a large and productive 
dairying section and one of the largest cheese markets of the 
East. The generous proportion of beautiful homes is indica- 
tive of the fact that the city has profited financially as a result 
of all these conditions. 
Arnolda is a sity of approximately 32,000 population and 
has adopted the sity manager type of government. The mayor 
and Common Council are elected by the people. The city 
manager, city teasurer and city auditor, together with the 
Board of Education, are appointed by the mayor. The super- 
intendent of schools is appointed by the Board of Education. 
The business af’airs of the Board of Education are handled 
by the superintendent of schools aided by two clerks, one of 
whom has been «lesignated as Clerk of the Board of Education 
in addition to her other duties. The teaching force consists 
of thirteen prircipals, forty-five high school teachers, one 
hundred forty-five elementary teachers and ten special teach- 
ers and supervisors. One man has charge of the attendance 
work. The jani:orial force consists of seventeen janitors and 
helpers, four matrons, and four mechanics who are 
listed as janitors’ helpers, although they are in reality repair 
men. The total amount paid for salaries is approximately 
$331,000 annual y. 
224
-P-A-G-E-241
  BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION OF SCHOOLS 225 
Teachers’ absences are recorded by the principals to the 
superintendent’s secretary by telephone on the days that the 
pay roll is to be set up. In the case of janitors, absences are 
reported by the head janitor either by telephone or in person. 
Substitute teachers are reported to the central office at the 
same time that teachers’ absences are reported. Unless a sub- 
stitute is engaged for a particular teacher, her absence is not 
reported. There are several ways in which the principal 
handles the situation if a teacher is ill. It may be that the 
principal herself will take charge of the class. Sometimes, 
special teachers in the building alternate with the principal in 
taking charge. Occasionally, rooms are dismissed and children 
sent to their homes. There seems to be resentment on the 
part of some teachers when a substitute is engaged to fill the 
place of a teacher absent for a whole or a portion of the day 
only. 
The pay roll for teachers is made up on blank paper and in 
duplicate. The pay roll for janitors is included with the teach- 
ers’ pay roll. In addition to this, there is a special form for 
the pay roll of janitors who belong to the city and state pension 
system. This form is made in duplicate, one of which is sent 
to the secretary of the Municipal City Service Commission; 
the other is sent to the state capitol and filed with the pension 
system. There is also a special pay roll for the repair men. 
These pay rolls are made up in the superintendent’s office and 
a treasury warrant sheet made in duplicate is signed by the 
superintendent of schools and the president of the Board of 
Education. On this treasury warrant sheet is entered the 
total amount of the pay roll. These several forms are then 
taken to the city auditor for his approval. One copy of the 
warrant sheet is filed with the city auditor and one copy with 
the city treasurer. The warrant checks to the several indi- 
viduals are made out in the superintendent’s office and accom- 
pany the pay rolls and treasury warrant sheets. These checks 
are signed by the auditor, city treasurer and the city manager, 
and in the order indicated. The city manager returns the 
checks to the auditor and thence to the office of the superin- 
tendent. Since the city does business with two separate 
banks, checks are made out for either bank “B” or bank “C.” 
The checks having been signed by the city treasurer, the
-P-A-G-E-242
  226 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
amounts are charged against the appropriation for salaries on 
the warrant register in the treasurer’s office. When the checks 
are returned to the superintendent’s office, they are entered 
on the ledger for distribution of expenditures. The amount of 
the treasury warrant sheet is entered in the voucher register. 
One copy of the pay roll (regular) is filed in the superintend- 
ent’s office. The other copy is filed with the city auditor. The 
janitor’s pay roll serves as a voucher jacket for pay rolls for 
schools. Pay roll vouchers are filed separate from other vouch- 
ers in the auditor’s office; cancelled checks are filed according 
to bank “B” or bank “C” and by number in the city treasurer’s 
office. 
Janitors’ checks are distributed by the superintendent of 
schools on the days of alternate weeks when all janitors come 
to the general store in the high school building for supplies. 
Teachers’ checks are distributed by the principals of the 
several buildings. 
Assignment 
1. Determine the principles underlying pay roll procedure. 
2. Set up an adequate system of records and reports for all 
salaried employees in the school system. 
8. Set up forms for adequate pay roll procedure.

  PROBLEM 29 
INSURING SCHOOL BUILDINGS 
Problem: According to the last census, Kenilworth, N. K., had 
a population of 30,000. 
As a result of a state law, recently passed, governing the 
insurance of school property against loss by fire, the Board of 
Education undertook to establish the “sound value” of its sev- 
eral buildings and contents. 
The superintendent was confronted with various problems. 
It became necessary: 
1. To determine the adequacy of the program as to the 
amount of insurance to be carried. 
2. To determine the type of clause under which to insure. 
This involves responsibility for losses as well as for econ- 
omy in expenditures. 
8. To determine the type and the financial standing of the 
companies with whom the insurance is to be placed. 
4. To determine the plan for distributing the business 
locally.

furniture, appurtenances’ . . . ‘apparatus’... . ‘library’... ‘in 
some company created under the laws of this state’... or 
‘authorized by law to transact business in this state’ .. . ‘and to 
comply with the conditions of the policy, and raise the sums 
paid for premiums by district tax.’” 
The Department of Education rules that: 
“Failure to insure school buildings on the part of the school 
board is a violation of the law, and the trustees are personally 
liable in case of loss.” 
Letter from Chief of Administration Division, State Depart- 
ment of Education, October 20, 1922: 
  “While there is no specific provision with respect to insurance 
contained in Sec. 868 which defines the powers and duties of the 
city board of education, this section authorizes and empowers a 
city board to perform any duty imposed upon boards of educa- 
tion or trustees of common schools. 
The board of education of the city school district is intrusted 
with the care, custody, control and safe-keeping of all school 
property or other property of the city used for educational, social, 
or recreational work and not specifically placed by law under the 
control of some other body or officer. It is, therefore, my opinion 
that the board of education in each city school district should see 
that the school property is insured and that such board may in- 
clude within its budget an item to cover the premiums.” 
Letter from Counsel Law Division, State Department of Educa- 
tion, December 29, 1922: 
“Whether it does or does not pay to insure is not a question for 
most districts to decide. All except cities must insure; but to what 
extent, and — is nee left to them. 
“Cities a ‘iat insure in Mutuals. 
“Appraisal firms, those skilled in the science of appraisal, find 
little business in the school field. 
“In cities of the third class, school authorities, together with 
insurance companies and appraisal firms, do the appraising in about 
50% of the cases. 
“This in the light of the second clause of the standard policy, in 
the light of all the writers on the subject, and in the light of uni- 
form business practice, is unsound and needs attention.
-P-A-G-E-245
  BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION OF SCHOOLS 229 
“The important element in arriving at valuation of contents is 
the taking of inventory. Fifty-seven and seven-tenths per cent of 
the districts answering the inquiry report appraisal with inventory ; 
28.7% with no inventory and 15.6% with some other method than 
those tabulated. 
“Tn the appraisal of contents, there is no local person more ca- 
pable than school authorities. 
“It is comparatively easy, though requiring time and care, for 
school authorities to take stock account. The records of expendi- 
tures for supplies and equipment give a basis for valuing contents. 
But even school authorities, with tangible evidence before them, 
may arrive at inaccurate figures. 
“|. . Values of fixed improvements often are included in neither 
value of building nor value of contents. 
“. , . Although for cities of the third class, . . . the tendencies 
are fairly consistent, showing that appraisals are made about 
equally under the three specified terms: namely, every year, every 
three years, and at the expiration of the policy. 
“Frequent appraisals (school buildings), if properly made, dis- 
cover hazards if they exist, and save dollars. 
“Methods of coverage:—Insured blanket as to coverage 
“Specifically on buildings 
“Specifically on contents 
“Blanket as to location.” 
Ratio of amount of insurance to sound value: 
“It should always be remembered that any departure from full 
insurance is an assumption of risk, and the question to be decided 
is whether the premium saved warrants the risk taken. The answer 
should be based on expert analysis of conditions and scientific study 
data.” Blanchard: “Municipal Fire Insurance in Great Britain 
and the United States,” National Municipal Review, Vol. V, No. 3. 
“These medians show that public school buildings and contents 
throughout New York State are insured to about 60% of sound 
value.” 
“One thing, I am sure, your insurance inquiry will reveal is that 
only a small per cent of insurance to value is usually carried. 
This is one of the factors in our loss experience.” Mgr. Fire Insur- 
ance Co. 
“The established basis for the correct writing of insurance is 80% 
to value. On this basis we are usually in a position to grant lower 
insurance rates than where small amount to value is carried. This 
means a saving in the cost of insurance and added protection in
-P-A-G-E-246
  230 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
case of severe loss. You can easily see that 40% or 50% insur- 
ance to value does not give the insurance company the same chance 
to make a little money as 80% or 90% insurance to value. Natu- 
rally, we are not in business for our health, and since experience 
shows that a very large percentage of schoolhouse fires result in 
heavy damage, low insurance to value gives us a total loss.” 
“The type of construction of buildings, except for fireproof 
buildings, has no bearing on the amount of insurance carried in 
relation to sound value.” 
“The Three-Fourths Value Clause—Company liable for amount 
not to exceed (34) three-fourths actual cash value of property.” 
“The Average Clause—synonymous with Co-insurance Clause in 
New York State.” After the 80% Co-insurance Clause, “The next 
greatest frequency is for third-class cities the 90% Co-insurance 
Clause.” 
“Tn third-class cities, no frame buildings are included under a Co- 
insurance Clause, but under a Full-value Clause.”

  The rules and regulations of the school board include the 
following: 
Any teacher who shall be absent more than five days on account 
of personal illness or death in the immediate family shall be entitled 
to half pay only for each day after the first five. For absence 
in excess of ten days during the year or for absence due to any 
cause other than personal illness or domestic affliction, a teacher 
shall be paid no salary unless otherwise ordered by the Committee. 
Immediate family is construed to include only a parent, wife, child, 
brother or sister. 
There is no reference in the rules and regulations to absences 
of any other members of the school organization.

  236 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
The state pension regulations which are in force affect teach- 
ers as follows: 
The board establishes percentage of teacher’s salary each year. 
This percentage must be not less than 3% or more than 7%. 
Minimum $35.00. Maximum $100.00. Only one rate has been 
established since organization, which is 5%. 
“Teachers” only are included. A local pension fund for 
janitors exacts a 2% of salary which is substituted by the 
Board of Education and thus paid into the fund. 
Assignment 
1. Make out the principal’s monthly report of the attend- 
ance of teachers at the Jackson School for the month of 
November. 
2. The report is duly transmitted to the central administra- 
tive office. Make the pay roll for this school. Payments are 
on a ten-monthg’ basis. 
3. Make the recapitulation of this pay roll for spreading 
on ledger of distribution of expenditures. 
4. Develop a pay roll calculator which will expedite calcu- 
lations and will include all operations. 
5. Discuss the functions of a “paymaster’ in school systems. 
6. Outline the most satisfactory plan for issuing the pay roll 
checks in this school system. 
7. Why is a “pay day calendar” a desirable administrative 
device? 
8. What should be the attitude of the administration to the 
final payment in the year? What problems arise for solution? 
9. Is the twelve-months’ payment plan superior to the ten- 
months’? Discuss the bi-weekly payment plan. 
10. In School System “X,” the deduction for absence rule 
is in effect. Over-payments are consequently made to indi- 
vidual teachers who make a refund at time of payment. Is 
this good business practice? If not, outline a plan to be fol- 
lowed which will eliminate refunds.

  PROBLEM 31 
ACCOUNTING FOR SCHOOL BONDED 
INDEBTEDNESS 
Problem: To set up an accounting system which will give at 
all times the pertinent facts concerning past school bond issues. 
In 1922, on having accepted appointment as superintendent 
of schools in the city of Rinston, N. K., you found public 
interest centering in the building of two new buildings, ie., a 
modern senior high school and a modern junior high school. 
The need for these new buildings was clearly evident to you 
in the initial survey of the buildings. After much searching, 
you found the school bonded indebtedness to be as shown in 
Table 1. The assessed valuations in Rinston total 62 millions. 
Assignment 
1. What form should these facts assume so that proper 
amounts may be included in the budget for the ensuing year? 
2. Set up the form of record which will give the essenial 
information before any further indebtedness can be incurred. 
8. What are the advantages of the sinking fund type of bond 
over the serial? 
4, What form should sinking fund accounting take? 
5. Is it possible to discover from Table 1 the amount which 
should have been included in the sinking fund at this time? 
6. Wherein lies the difference between serial notes and 
serial bonds? 
7. Has the purpose of issue in this city been a proper one 
for each of the bond issues listed in Table 1? 
8. What are the implications to be drawn from bond issues 
which cover a period of thirty years? 
9. What is the tendency with respect to the length of life 
of school bond issues in the United States?

PROBLEM 32 
HANDLING TEXTBOOKS AND SUPPLIES 
Problem: Criticize the present practice in the purchasing, 
storage and distribution of textbooks, supplies, and equipment 
in Owasso, N. K., and propose better methods of admin- 
istration. 
  Owasso, although primarily an industrial center with diver- 
sified products, is the outlet for a large and productive dairy- 
ing section and one of the largest cheese markets of the East. 
The generous proportion of beautiful homes is indicative of 
the fact that the city has profited financially as a result of all 
of these conditions. 
The authority for the present system of public schools is 
found in the general school law of the state and the charter for 
the city of Owasso. The responsibility for the organization 
and operation of the public schools is vested in the Board of 
Education, appointed at large by the mayor. The Board is, 
in fact, fiscally dependent. 
The organization of the business administration of the pub- 
lic schools centers in the office of the superintendent. With 
two clerks (one of whom is officially the clerk of the Board of 
Education), the superintendent discharges or directs all of the 
duties and activities of this department except those for which 
the city auditor and city treasurer are responsible. All of the 
routine of business administration is done in two rooms pro- 
vided for the use of the Board of Education by the city. The 
arrangement of the offices is the result of a combination of con- 
ditions such as inadequate lighting and limited space, showing 
that the building had not been planned for the expeditious 
routing of business through the offices. The present utilization 
of clerical assistance does not make available adequate records 
and reports in such form as to be of maximum value to the 
system and to the public. Moreover, the superintendent, in 
spite of the fact that he delegates much of this work, feels the 
241 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
  242 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
necessity for focusing most of his time and attention on the 
routine of this office. 
The system of storage of textbooks, supplies and equipment 
includes a small cupboard in each teacher’s room in which 
about one week’s supply of materials, textbooks and other in- 
structional equipment is usually kept; a small space for stor- 
age in the principal’s office for special and emergency mate- 
rials; and a space (in the basement usually) large enough for 
the storage of materials required for a term and the textbooks 
belonging to the particular building. In addition to these 
spaces, there is a central store room located in the high school 
building. A basement corridor in the same building is used 
for the storage of janitor’s supplies. 
The organization of the central store room is chaotic. There 
are no records kept to show what materials had been received 
in this room, except the check on the separate invoices from 
vendors made by the superintendent himself. No record is 
kept from year to year of textbooks, supplies and equipment, 
either educational or operational, issued to the individual 
schools. No tag or tag ledger system is in operation. 
The supply list is antiquated and inadequate. 
There is no adequate system for requisitioning textbooks, 
supplies and equipment. A “principal’s order blank” is pro- 
vided for ordering operation and emergency instructional 
supplies. 
While there is a list of officially adopted texts in the annual 
report, this list has been subjected to frequent unofficial re- 
vision especially in the supplementary reading line. 
There is no stock record, no distribution record for either 
textbooks, supplies or equipment, nor is there a principal’s 
annual inventory of either textbooks, supplies or equipment. 
There is no superintendent’s annual summary of textbooks, 
supplies or equipment. There is no standard textbook, supply 
or equipment quota. 
There is no janitor’s annual supply inventory; no annual 
supply summary. 
Checking of textbooks, supplies and equipment is done by 
the principals for the purpose of determining whether quan- 
tities of the various materials ordered have been received. No 
record is made in such form that it may be used in accurate
-P-A-G-E-259
  BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION OF SCHOOLS 243 
textbook, supplies and equipment accounting. Operation sup- 
plies are distributed with the same degree of carelessness and 
disregard for accurate determination of unit costs. 
The regular warrant or treasury warrant sheet, as it is called, 
is supplied from the office of the city auditor. The superin- 
tendent’s clerk makes out the warrant sheet, but the warrant 
checks covering the payment of the several vouchers are made 
out by the auditor’s office force. The warrant sheet is signed 
by the president of the Board of Education and the superin- 
tendent of schools. The warrant checks are signed by the city 
auditor, the city treasurer, and the city manager. One copy of 
the treasury warrant sheet is filed with the city auditor and 
the other is filed with the city treasurer. The amounts of the 
several warrant checks are charged against appropriation ac- 
counts in the treasurer’s office, where cancelled checks are filed. 
Voucher jackets and contents are filed in the auditor’s office. 
The forms employed and their actual utilization are shown 
below: 
Requisition 
This form is mimeographed in the office of the superintendent and 
contains blank space for the name of the school and a list of 
“Books and Supplies,” with instructions “Please order by number, 
not by dozen.” A blank space before each item is provided for 
inserting the quantity required. No date space is provided. The 
principal’s signature is not asked for on the form. The same items 
have been included in the list for several years requiring principals 
to add extra sheets in order that both texts and materials, now 
approved, may be requisitioned. 
From the requisitions sent to the superintendent’s office semi- 
annually, the clerks make up the list from which the textbooks 
and materials needed for all the schools are ordered semi-annually. 
This list may or may not include all the items requisitioned by the 
principals. It is submitted to or discussed with some or all of the 
members of the Visiting Committee, approved as is or cut and 
then approved. Then it goes to the Board for action on resolution 
presented by some member of the Visiting Committee that the 
superintendent be authorized to purchase. 
Purchase Order 
This form is printed, in triplicate, numbered, with space for date, 
space for firm name, space to enter name of school and address, 
space for listing articles, and space for signature of school officer. 
The following note appears on the bottom portion of the form.  
-P-A-G-E-260
244 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
  N. B—Be sure the Order Number appears on your invoice. All bills must 
be verified. A Notary may be found at this office. 
This form is issued in triplicate over the signature of either the 
superintendent or the head janitor. The original is sent to the 
vendor. This white copy the vendor retains as his authorization 
for delivery of materials. The pink copy of the Purchase Order 
(1st carbon) and the blue copy (2nd carbon) remain temporarily 
with the issuing officer. The pink copy is attached to the voucher 
jacket along with the Board of Education billing form and vendor’s 
invoice for purposes of audit, payment authorization, and filing. 
The blue copy is filed in the superintendent’s office. The head 
janitor brings the copies of Purchase Orders he has issued to the 
office of the superintendent at infrequent intervals. 
The Purchase Order is.a check used by the clerk on the invoices 
from vendors. This form is used primarily for local vendors. 
Purchase Order (Special Form) 
A special form-of Purchase Order for firms outside of Owasso, 
N. K., has space for date, firm name, means of transportation, 
space for list of merchandise, and below there is place for signature. 
This form is printed on white paper and padded, not specially ar- 
ranged for duplicating copies. 
The use of the special form for out-of-town firms is infrequent. 
The triplicate form in three separate colors seems to be the 
favorite for all purposes. 
Board of Education Billing Form 
The printed form has space for the date, the name of vendor, the 
list of articles, price, blank affidavit. 
This form is provided so that all bills may be “verified before a 
notary.” “Billing form” is supposed to be sent out with the 
Purchase Order. 
Delivery of Textbooks, Supplies, etc. 
Local firms deliver supplies in keeping with Purchase Order 
instructions at any one of the buildings—at the superintendent’s 
office, at the general store room in the high school, as the case may 
be. Freight shipments are taken care of by Samson’s (truckers), | 
freight charges paid by Samson and billed to the Board of Educa- 
tion along with the trucking. General supplies and textbooks are 
delivered at the general store room. Whatever checking there is, 
is done by the superintendent. In the distribution to the several 
buildings, the bulk of the supplies is ready for delivery before 
school opens and Samson is utilized late in August, and in January 
for the second term, for this purpose. Janitors are utilized each 
second week to distribute their supplies, except that the head 
janitor delivers with his Ford many things that janitors do not or
-P-A-G-E-261
BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION OF SCHOOLS 245 
cannot carry. Shortages in the lists for the opening of each term 
may be distributed by janitors at a later date. Shortages are 
checked on the principal’s semi-annual requisition by the principal 
of each building and later the superintendent’s office sends a note 
to the principal showing the shortage as the office knows it. 
The central store room has no organization for systematic check- 
ing nor inventory book or file. 
Delivery of supplies from local firms is not checked in such a 
way that any record gets to the superintendent’s office, except the 
weight bills for coal which janitors deliver to principals and the 
slips get to the superintendent’s office. 
Voucher Jacket 
Upon receipt of the invoice and “verified” billing form from the 
vendor, the clerk in the superintendent’s office attaches the invoice, 
purchase order and billing form to the voucher jacket. This is a 
printed form, with spaces for detailed expenditures distribution, 
date, name of firm, purchase order number, bank symbol, warrant 
check number. 
This form is prepared for the superintendent and by him pre- 
sented to some or all of the interested committee for their approval. 
Then the form goes to the Finance Committee for their approval. 
The form is then presented to the Board of Education in regular 
or special session along with other bills. On motion of the 
Finance Committee, a resolution is adopted authorizing the pay- 
ment of the total amount of the bills presented. 
The bills passed for payment are delivered to the auditor, who has 
warrant checks drawn covering each voucher jacket passed for 
payment by the Board of Education. 
Treasury Warrant 
With the bills passed for payment by the Board of Education, 
there goes a form called the “treasury warrant.” This form is 
printed, in duplicate, 16” x 20”, two colors (blue and white), carries 
space for treasury warrant number, sheet number, date, voucher 
numbers, payee, account to be charged to, nature of payment, fund, 
code number, amount, total and check number, while at the bottom 
of the sheet is the following: 
OWABSO NG Bae cites 'sd sivien:siiis ascents 192.. 
To the Treasurer of the City of Owasso: 
Pay to each of the persons named in the above warrant and in the 
pay rolls attached thereto the sums against their respective names 
amounting in the aggregate to .......... ee ee ee cee cece dollars 
and charge the same to the account indicated.

-P-A-G-E-262
246 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
This form is signed by the superintendent and the president of the 
Board. It serves as the authorization for the checks which, in the 
case of the payment for textbooks and supplies, are drawn in the 
auditor’s office. 
Warrant Check 
This form is printed in large sheets (perforated), contains space 
for date, name of bank “B” or “C,” number, voucher number, payee, 
account to be charged, amount, signatures of treasurer and man- 
ager. The warrant check together with the voucher jacket to which 
are attached verified billing form, purchase order, and invoice are 
passed to the city treasurer for his signature and separate listing. 
They are then charged against the school appropriation and the 
particular accounts thereunder. The voucher with inclosures and 
check are then passed to the city manager to be signed. He returns 
the voucher, etc., to the auditor who passes the same on to the 
superintendent’s office. The clerk mails the warrant check to the 
vendor. The check is then returned endorsed by vendor, cancelled 
by bank “B” or “C,” to the auditor. The check is filed by number 
and bank in the auditor’s office. The voucher jacket and attached 
invoice, “verified billing form,” and purchase order remain in the 
superintendent’s office until the amount represented in the voucher 
is distributed in the expenditures ledger and the voucher number 
and amount are listed in the voucher register. 
Irregularities 
Requisitions do not always pass through the superintendent’s 
office. The high school principal sometimes presents requisitions to 
a member of a special or standing committee who in turn presents 
the requisition to the Board; sometimes he appears before the Board 
with his requests. The regular routing may then be followed. The 
high school principal conducts a store in the high school, the profits 
from which have been used in part for the purchase, direct, of office 
supplies, equipment and sundry other things among which office 
furniture is not the least important. These items have not been 
purchased through the regular channels. The telephone and pro- 
gram clock system in the high school were purchased from the 
profits of this store. 
The head janitor makes purchases of some minor items, issuing 
purchase orders on the spot. Another plan is to consult the chair- 
man or some member of the Executive Committee and then issue 
a purchase order for the needed material. Sometimes this com- 
mitteeman presents the matter to the Board. Sometimes the head 
janitor presents a request to the superintendent and the Purchase
-P-A-G-E-263
  BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION OF SCHOOLS 247 
Order is issued with or without the consent of the Executive Com- 
mittee being secured. Irregularities in this division are quite 
frequent. Emergency needs may warrant the practice in some cases. 
Principal’s “Order Blank” 
Printed on blank paper the form contains space for date, school, 
materials needed and the signature of the principal. The form as 
used does not seem to have been made out in duplicate, nor a list 
of the requests kept in the principal’s office. It is used for both 
instructional and operation materials. It is sent to the superin- 
tendent’s office. 
Each second Tuesday, the superintendent issues janitor and other 
supplies from the general store room at the high school building to 
those janitors who appear. In case the amount to be taken to a 
building is greater than the janitor can carry, the head janitor 
delivers the excess with his Ford. The Board pays him $10.00 a 
month for this service.

  PROBLEM 33 
A HIGH SCHOOL STORE 
Problem: Because of any one or all of the reasons given below, 
the Genasco Board of Education was asked that the high 
school principal be permitted to conduct a store in the high 
school building for the sale of textbooks and supplies. The 
Board authorized the store. Were they justified in taking this 
action? 
The reasons assigned for opening the store were as follows: 
1. Desire of the school to provide commercial students with 
actual business situations, transactions, and experience as part 
of their training. 
2. Desire of the school to supply high school pupils with 
textbooks and supplies without delay. 
8. Delays on the part of the Board of Education in granting 
the requests of the superintendent for equipment to be used 
in the high school office. 
4. Delay of the superintendent in making, or reluctancy to 
make requests to the Board of Education for needed equip- 
ment and supplies for the high school. 
5. Desire of the high school principal to be independent of 
the central office. 
The minutes of the Board of Education for the year 1910 
indicate that the request of the high school principal was 
granted. The only condition specified called for an audit of 
the accounts of the store at least twice each year. 
Resolved, That the principal of the high school be permitted to 
conduct a store for the sale of textbooks and supplies in the corridor 
of the high school building; 
That the accounts of the store shall be audited at least once in six 
months by competent persons; 
That no charge be made for the use of the space required for the 
store, for heating and lighting the same. 
250
-P-A-G-E-267
  BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION OF SCHOOLS 251 
The Genasco High School has an enrolment of 1,098 for 
1923. The school day is divided into six fifty-minute-periods. 
Seven teachers are employed in the commercial work of the 
school. 
At the time this experiment was started, only one merchant 
in Genasco was handling textbooks. By negotiating a loan 
from one of the banks in the name of “Mr. High School Prin- 
cipal, Manager” he was able to buy the stock of textbooks 
from the local concern as weil as the good will in that par- 
ticular branch of the business. 
This supply of books was moved to the high school building 
and installed in a space about twenty-five or thirty by ten or 
fifteen feet in the first floor corridor. This space was originally 
a part of the general store room. 
The management of the store is indicated by the title of the 
separate bank account of “Mr. High School Principal, Man- 
ager.” The high school principal is the purchasing agent as 
well as the manager. He determines the policy of the business 
which is that the store be conducted so as to yield “about 
twenty-five per cent profit.” 
The purchasing is done by or under the direction of the 
manager. No special form is provided. The purchases are 
made on school stationery. A copy is kept on file in the prin- 
cipal’s office. The bulk of the buying is done in July and 
January. However, items are ordered intermittently. Ship- 
ments of both textbooks and supplies are made from publishers 
and supply houses direct to “Mr. High School Principal, Man: 
ager,” some as a result of written mail and some as a result 
of telephonic orders. 
Invoices for textbooks and supplies are received in the prin- 
cipal’s office and are paid by checks signed “Mr. High School 
Principal, Manager.” Receipted invoices are filed in the high 
school office files. Cancelled checks and bank statements of 
“Mr. High School Principal, Manager” are also filed in the 
same office. 
The ledger accounts of bills payable for the store are kept 
by the principal’s clerk who is an employee of the Board of 
Education. A cash book, and a register of daily sales showing 
the amounts placed in each of the four cash drawers and the
-P-A-G-E-268
  252 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
amount taken out at the close of the day, are also kept by the 
principal’s clerk. 
The special forms employed in the operation of the store 
are attached hereto. They include: (1) cash report; (2) 
insert for use in second-hand books; and (8) receipt or sales 
slip for second-hand books. 
The actual sales are usually made by students in the com- 
mercial department. Mr. Principal also makes sales at times. 
The assignment of students is made by the teacher in charge 
of the commercial department. Pupils are assigned for a 
certain period of the day during four weeks. They are re- 
warded for their work with extra credits on a scale of 0 to 20 
according to the degree of accuracy with which the individual 
handles her part of the work in the store. These credits may 
be used to increase the class rating in any subject to which 
the pupil may elect to apply them. 
The total sales in any one year according to Mr. High School 
Principal has reached almost $6,000, while the profits from the 
store have enabled him to “turn back into the school” $11,000. 
This sum is now represented in part by a clock system, a 
telephone system, a multigraph, a cardex system, an adding 
machine, a Monroe calculating machine, a Dick mimeograph, 
cash register with four drawers and the office furniture in the 
private office of the principal. 
One day’s sales in September amounted to “about $1,100” 
according to Mr. Principal. 
In striking contrast with the principal’s office, with almost 
every device for increasing the efficiency of his two clerks, is 
the office of the superintendent of schools equipped with type- 
writers and an adding machine. There is also a gelatine pad 
duplicator in the superintendent’s office. There is much more 
work to be done in the latter office. 
The supplies for the high school store are kept under lock 
in a part of the general store room which has been wired off 
for all school supplies for the city, the key to which the prin- 
cipal keeps in his charge. The books and supplies in the store 
itself are not systematically protected against pilfering during 
school hours or while the store is supposed to be open. 
The store does provide an adequate supply of the texts that 
are in use in the school. It also provides for the sale of second-

Special Forms 
The special forms employed in the operation of the store 
are shown on pages 253-254. 
The cash report, Form A, is a mimeographed blank showing 
for each drawer—‘“cash in till in a. m.,” “reading Pp. m.,” 
“total,” “paid out,” “net cash,” “distribution of cash,” (checks, 
silver, bills) ‘total,” “over,” and “short.” Below is a place for 
the signature of the manager or clerk who checks the day’s 
business through the cash register. 
In handling the sale of second-hand books, two blanks are 
employed, Form B and Form C. The “insert” is a printed form 
with a perforation running across the sheet about an inch and 
a quarter from the top. Above the perforation is space for the 
“owner’s name,” “price asked,” and “the date the book is 
entered for sale.” This portion of the insert is glued to the 
inside of the cover of the book. The portion of the sheet un- 
attached to the cover has space for the “owner’s name,” “title 
of the book,” “price asked,” and “date,” also the word “sold” 
in large type. Below “sold” is space for the “date of sale,” 
“name of person to whom sold,” “amount received,” “com- 
mission ...... »’ “net proceeds,” and “signature of the clerk 
making sale.” A line across the sheet so divides the insert 
that below is space to insert the “date” that the proceeds of 
the sale are turned over to the student selling the book. When
-P-A-G-E-272
256 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
his “signature” is attached, the sheet serves as a receipt for 
the store records. This is filed in the principal’s office. 
The “receipt used in the sale of second-hand books” is 
printed in duplicate, the original black, the duplicate in red. 
It contains space for “date,” “name of student selling,” “price 
asked,” “clerk who takes the book into the store.” One copy 
goes to the student offering the book for sale, while the other 
goes into the cash drawer. Later, the duplicate is filed for 
checking with the sale slip or for reference in tracing the 
book. 
When a clerk sells the book, she enters on the insert the 
date, the person to whom sold and the amount received. She 
places the slip and the cash in the cash drawer. These slips 
are filed until enough have accumulated to justify a “pay day.” 
A list of those whose books have been sold is prepared and 
these students are notified. As the students receive the money 
derived from the sale of their books, they sign their names at 
the bottom of the insert indicating that they have received 
the cash indicated above for the book listed. The clerk in 
the principal’s office files the receipted inserts. They are not 
used to tell the amount of business that is done in second- 
hand books. 
The time required for keeping the store ledger, the cash 
register record and the cash book would have to be estimated 
because no record is kept of the division of time spent in each 
of the separate fields of employment. In all, possibly two 
hours a day is a fair average for the store’s share of this clerk’s 
time. 
All of the school officials connected with the store seem to 
feel proud of the success with which the business is conducted.

of whether the store should exist or not?

PROBLEM 34 
SCHOOL PUBLICITY 
Problem: The city of High Plains, N. K., has a population of 
approximately 32,000. It has two evening papers—The Sun 
and The Banner—each of about 14,000 circulation. How can 
adequate publicity be secured in these journals? 
At a school board meeting, a member remarked that for- 
merly the public was keenly interested in school matters but 
that for some years he and other members had felt a growing 
public apathy toward school problems, which worried him. 
Other members and the superintendent at once said that the 
local papers did not give schools enough mention or discussion 
on major problems, and consequently public apathy was to be 
expected. To this, a newspaper man on the board replied that 
the papers were friendly enough to the schools and willing 
to publish all real school news if the school authorities would 
furnish the facts, but that the papers could not be expected to 
hunt up all the school news on their own time. He thought 
the superintendent ought to make special efforts to have the 
papers carry news and comment calculated to arouse greater 
interest and support for the schools. The superintendent said 
that this had not heretofore been considered part of his work. 
The member replied that it ought to be, in his judgment, and 
moreover he had heard something to the effect that in some 
cities a good deal was being done on school publicity and 
books had even been written on it. 
Another member remarked that he would like more informa- 
tion and accordingly, on his motion, the superintendent was 
directed to report several weeks later on the matter, covering 
at least these points: 
1. The essential facts about the school news that had ap- 
peared in both local papers for the last three years. 
2. A concise statement of what was being done in other 
cities on securing press codperation on school news. 
8. Specific recommendation for action in High Plains.

as follows.

SCHOOL PUBLICITY 261 
Interpretation of data—lIt will be noted that aside from 
news items of a miscellaneous character, “Buildings” consti- 
tute approximately 25% and “Finance” approximately 22% of 
all the news items. The “Budget,” “Salaries,” “Deficits” and 
“Dual Control” constitute almost 80% of all school finance 
items. The frequent mention of buildings during this period 
is due, of course, to the large building program undertaken 
at that time which involved the expenditure of almost half a 
million dollars. 
In other words, school buildings and school finance were the 
two topics most frequently discussed in the High Plains Sun 
from 1919 to 1924. 
In a very real way, the question of “dual control” made 
necessary the discussion of the items—“Budget”—“Deficit” 
and “Salaries.” To get the approval of the budget, the Board 
of Education was compelled to submit it to the council; to 
increase teachers’ salaries, the council had to be consulted; and 
to make up any deficit, the council must appropriate. 
The excerpts appended will serve to show the trend of think- 
ing on the part of the paper whose files were examined. 
Sun—February 17, 1919 
Increases which were promised to the teachers in the 
spring of 1918 and which amount to $14,601.52 have not 
been paid because the Board of Education has not received 
the money from the common council. A resolution, intro- 
duced by Commissioner ——, was passed requesting the 
common council to provide funds for the Board of Educa- 
tion to meet the expenditures for increased compensation 
to teachers. 
Sun—December 24, 1921 
The Mayor’s statement came after criticism from some 
of the commissioners over what they regarded as the ap- 
parent unwillingness of the Board of Education to co- 
operate in a reduction of expenses. 
Sun—November 18, 1919 
Action of the Board of Education at its regular meeting 
Monday night leaves the question of increased salaries for 
teachers during the coming school year squarely up to the 
common council. The Board adopted resolutions strongly 
favoring the increases and all that now remains to make 
the higher salaries a reality is an appropriation of $16,350 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
  262 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
by the common council. It was reported at the meeting of 
the Board that information had been received that the 
aldermen had been approached by the teachers and that 
the majority of the council favored the increases asked, 
which would assure them of having their petition granted. 
Sun—October 15, 1920 
Financial troubles beset the Board of Education at its 
meeting Monday evening. Commissioner ——, chairman of 
the Finance Committee, reported that with the money on 
hand and all that there were prospects of receiving, there 
would be barely enough to pay the salaries of the teachers 
until January Ist. 
New salary law blamed. 
Board decided to go before council and ask for additional 
money for schools. 
Sun—March 25, 1921 
A general movement has been started in High Plains in 
common with other cities, to bring about financial inde- 
pendence for the Board of Education. . . . Those in High 
Plains who favor the movement for financial independence 
hold that the Board should be responsible for its own 
appropriations and accounts. It is their contention that 
the schools cannot be administered efficiently without 
sufficient funds... . 
If the Board of Education were divorced from the city 
council, a separate tax levy would be made for school 
purposes. 
Sun—December 20, 1921 
The Finance Committee reported that it had sufficient 
funds to meet the payment of bills and accounts audited 
at the meeting together with the pay roll due December 
23rd and that it had not become necessary to call on the 
council for the $6,000 promised by the council for the pay- 
ment of the salary of extra teachers. 
Sun—October 2, 1920— (Headline) 
EDUCATION BOARD ASKS FOR FUNDS 
Sun—November 11, 1922 
SCHOOL BOARD TO CONTROL FINANCES 
For many years, there has been some tension between 
the city council and the Board of Education mainly over 
the schools’ budget. It is very seldom that some effort is 
not made to cut the appropriations. The powers of the
-P-A-G-E-279
  SCHOOL PUBLICITY 263 
Board are very clearly outlined and according to the law 
of 1917, any amount asked for must be granted, while the 
city charter restrictions are definitely removed. 
It means that the Board of Education may continue 
work without the handicap of lack of funds as in previous 
years. 
Sun—May 7, 1922 
. . . Were the bill to be passed and the people to vote in 
favor of the proposition when it was submitted to them, 
it would mean that control of the Board of Education 
would be lost to the council and would revert to the people. 
Personally, I doubt whether such action would be popular 
if effective here, for when the people did have the oppor- 
tunity to vote for members of the Board of Education, 
little interest was ever manifested in the election, unless 
there was at issue some particular point upon which the 
several candidates differed. 
The Banner.—There was no separate file of school clippings 
available at the office of the Daily Banner. The files of papers 
were available, however. The limited time precluded 
making a complete tabulation of school news. Two complete 
sets of the paper, extending over three months each, were 
carefully checked however, and a sampling of the other papers 
covering the period from 1920 to date were studied. 
From this examination, it appears that the same type of 
school news is reported by the Banner as by the Sun and in 
about the same proportion. 
The general attitude of the paper seemed to be good. No 
“cheap,” destructive accounts of educational happenings were 
encountered. 
Appended are a few quotations from the Banner pertinent 
to the study of the organization and administration of the 
schools. 
Daily Banner—December 20, 1921

The Board of Education and the City Council are in 
controversy over a sum of money which the Board of 
Education, at the end of the year of 1921, showed as a 
balance over other expenses and which the City Council 
took from them and placed in the general fund as desig- 
nated by the charter. . . . 
“As it stands at present, both the Council and the Board 
feel that they are right in the matter and neither appears 
to have given in a particle, the Council claiming the 
money and the Board demanding its return.”

PROBLEM 35 
PUBLICITY IN PREPARATION FOR BOND ISSUE 
Problem: The city of Sephos, N. W., has a population of 
60,000. Its Board of Education engages the services of a group 
of school planning experts to make a survey of school condi- 
tions. The survey report recommends the expenditure of ap- 
proximately $3,000,000. This city has never provided any- 
thing like this amount of money for public education. The 
situation calls for the development of an adequate program 
of publicity. 
OUTSTANDING ADULT AND CHILD POPULATION FACTS 
1. Sephos is predominantly a city of native-born Ameri- 
cans. 
2. While urban population in the United States has grown 
significantly during the last census decade, Sephos has re- 
mained practically at a standstill. 
3. Births exceed deaths in Sephos by a relatively small 
margin. 
4, The percentage of population 21 years of age and over 
is relatively high in Sephos as compared with other cities. 
The burden of public education is thus distributed among a 
larger number of adults than in many cities. 
5. The location and distribution of the industrial and com- 
mercial sections in the city are clearly determined by natural 
topography and because of the development of several freight- 
carrying transportation lines. 
6. The natural topography of the city assures permanent 
residential areas. The proposed intercommunicating parkway 
will hasten the residential growth in the eastern, northern and 
southern sections of the city. 
7. Approximately 12,500 children are seeking education in 
the public school system of the city. This represents approxi- 
265 
 
-P-A-G-E-282
  
266 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
mately 15.2% of the total population, a relatively low per- 
centage for cities of this size. 
8. The children of school age in Sephos, like those in other 
cities, have in recent years gone to school in larger numbers 
and are continuing their school careers into the high school 
to a degree that far surpasses the record of previous years. 
Conditions are, however, far from satisfactory. 
9. The most significant increase in school population during 
recent years has taken place in grades seven to twelve. 
10. Approximately one-half of the elementary children of 
Sephos are too old for their grades. 
11. Maladjustments in the classification of children exist in 
such proportions as to demand immediate attention. 
12. In each of three grades, differences of nine or more years 
exist between the youngest and the oldest child. 
13. Three out of every five children fail to make normal 
progress through the grades. 
14. More than half of the children are retarded one or more 
semesters and only one in every fifteen is able to gain time 
in his passage through school. 
15. Students in the high school make only slightly more 
regular progress than do children in the elementary schools. 
16. The age-progress conditions for colored children are in- 
ferior to those for white children. 
17. Only slight provision has been made for atypical chil- 
dren needing administrative planning for ungraded rooms, 
open-air rooms, special coaching rooms and for other cases 
which clearly fall outside of the regular progress through 
school. 
18. Basic factors contributing to the highly unsatisfactory 
school-progress conditions are the small building units in 
which a scientific and refined classification of children accord- 
ing to their needs and abilities is practically impossible. 
19. The junior-senior high school program of the future 
should draw its proportional quota of students from every 
section of the city. This implies an extension of high school 
facilities and the addition of the instructional offerings to the 
point where the social, educational, physical and vocational 
needs of children from all sections of the city are adequately 
met.
-P-A-G-E-283
SCHOOL PUBLICITY 267 
THE SCHOOL PLANT 
1. The school plant of Sephos has been developed on a 
scientific basis, keeping in mind both the ultimate plant and 
the immediate changes. 
2. The ultimate school plant for Sephos has been worked 
out on the basis of a K-6-3-3-2 organization. 
3. A modern school plant will have as few of each type 
of building as possible, consistent with desirable travel dis- 
tances and numbers sufficient to form an educationally 
effective and financially economical school. 
4, Travel distance standards for Sephos have been set in 
accordance with the best modern practice—one-half mile for 
elementary schools; one mile for junior high schools; and one 
and a half to two miles for senior high schools. Because of 
climatic conditions, two miles have been used for the senior 
high school rather than one and a half miles. 
5. The minimum size of school lots has also been set in 
accordance with modern standards as follows: five acres for 
elementary schools, eight acres for junior high schools and 
twelve acres for senior high schools. It should be borne in 
mind that these are minimums. 
6. Certain factors, such as transportation lines, parkway and 
boulevard development, industries, elevations, population 
trends, etc., have been carefully studied in locating school cen- 
ters in the ultimate plant. 
7. Economy has been kept in mind at all stages of the de- 
velopment of the plan. No good school building is arbitrarily 
thrown away merely to speed up the ultimate plan. 
8. Sephos has far too many buildings for the present school 
population and all of them are too small to get the best results 
educationally and to be operated most economically. 
9. By a careful process of eliminating totally unfit build- 
ings, permitting fair buildings to be worn out, securing ade- 
quate school sites while they can be secured at a low price, 
and by the erection of new and modern buildings at strategic 
locations, the city of Sephos can make great strides imme- 
diately toward a splendid modern school plant which will be 
attained by easy stages within a very few years and at a not 
unreasonable cost.
-P-A-G-E-284
  268 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
10. The new plant will provide for the needs of every sec- 
tion of the city as relates to elementary schools, junior high 
schools and senior high schools. 
11. The immediate program calls for the elimination of 
totally unfit buildings, combinations into larger units with 
correspondingly increased educational opportunities, the pur- 
chase of the most urgent new sites, the extension of certain 
present sites and buildings, and the erection of several new 
buildings in locations where the immediate need can be classed 
as urgent. 
12. The immediate program safeguards the ultimate pro- 
gram in every possible way. It substitutes a systematic plan 
for the lack of school planning. 
13. Both immediate and ultimate programs are based upon 
a most careful study of population trends as evidenced by 
registrations of voters, building permits, births and deaths and 
the resident location of present school population. 
14. In addition to the program for new sites, new buildings 
and extensions to present buildings, provision has been made 
so that unsafe and insanitary conditions in buildings that are 
to be retained may be eliminated. 
15. A program has been laid out for the colored schools 
which will immediately improve the three school plants. 
FINANCING THE PROGRAM 
1. The study of Sephos’ school finances is based on com- 
parisons made with 32 other American cities whose popula- 
tions in 1920 were between fifty and one hundred thousand. 
Receipts. 
2. Sephos last year received no school money through bor- 
rowing. The other 32 cities received 30% of their gross re- 
ceipts from short term loans and the selling of long term 
bond issues. 
3. Of the unborrowed receipts Sephos raised much of its 
funds through local taxation. In Sephos this percentage was 
87.5 and in the 32 cities it was 81.4. The percentages of 
Sephos’ receipts from the state and from the federal govern- 
ment are much lower than in the case of the group of cities 
with which comparison is made.
-P-A-G-E-285
  
SCHOOL PUBLICITY 269 
Expenditures 
4. Sephos’ total expenditure for school purposes per pupil 
in average daily attendance was $108 last year. Of the thirty 
cities compared with Sephos 70% expended a larger amount 
per pupil. 
5. Thirteen of these thirty cities expended more money per 
pupil for current expenses of their school systems. Sephos, 
with current expenses of $86.88 per pupil last year, occupied 
approximately the middle position among these cities. The 
range of these thirty cities was from $42.50 to $110.00 per 
pupil in average daily attendance. 
6. Sephos spent unusually small amounts per pupil for 
repairs, fixed charges, capital outlay, auxiliary agencies and 
educational control. 
7. The expenditure for business control, debt service, fuel 
and the wages of janitors was unusually high in Sephos. The 
high expenditure for debt service was the result of a heavy 
payment on the bonded indebtedness outstanding for school 
purposes. The high cost of operating the school plant was 
undoubtedly caused in large measure by the large number of 
small building units in the school system. 
8. Sephos’ position in per-pupil expenditures for instruc- 
tional service is third above the middle city among the thirty 
with which comparison is made. Twelve of these cities spent 
more per pupil. In Sephos 85% of the expenditure for instruc- 
tional service was devoted to the salary of teachers. The per- 
centage was the same for the whole group. 
9. Sephos has ample wealth and has sufficiently reduced its 
school bonded indebtedness so that the issue of $3,026,000 
of school bonds at this time can not be considered an excessive 
burden. 
10. Sephos has not kept pace with other cities of its class 
in its expenditures for new additions to the school plant. To 
attain a high educational rank among comparable cities, it is 
essential that the proposed bond issue be voted by the people 
of this city.

270 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION

PROBLEM 36 
CHARTS FOR EDUCATIONAL PUBLICITY 
Problem: To establish standards for graphic representation in 
the educational publicity of a school system. 
Superintendents, in their annual reports, have frequently 
utilized some form of graphic representation to portray im- 
portant facts. It is important that such graphic representa- 
tion point out facts in their true relation to one another. In 
utilizing charts and graphs for presenting facts to the general 
public, it should be borne in mind that their chief value lies 
in what they suggest at a glance. Clear distinctions should be 
made between charts and graphs for administrative use and 
those intended for the general public. Simplicity and clear 
accompanying explanations are essential characteristics of the 
latter class. : 
Dr. M. G. Neale, author of School Reports in American 
Cities, in his analysis of 103 annual school reports, found that 
35 contained charts, graphs or cartoons. Two hundred and 
eighty-two charts appeared in these 35 reports. The distribu- 
tion of these 282 was as follows:

PROBLEM 37 
THE LOCAL PRESS 
Problem: You are extremely anxious to secure publicity in the 
local press which will help to carry a bond election. The news- 
papers have not been helpful. Your publicity campaign must 
be developed in such manner as will win the support of all of 
the newspapers for the bond issue, if this is possible. 
Mirall, N. W., an industrial town of 65,000 population, has 
three daily papers,—the Globe, a Republican morning paper, 
conservative in tone; the Dispatch, a Democratic evening 
paper inclined to be considerably sensational; and the Times 
Review, an independent morning paper and radical. You, the 
new superintendent of schools, come into the situation to find 
that all three newspapers think of school news only in terms 
of the official acts of the Board of Education and quarrels aris- 
ing in the Board as to policies. You also find each of the 
three papers intensely jealous of the other two. The Globe 
and the Dispatch line up on opposite sides of every public 
question. 
The reporter on the Dispatch covering the school “beat” has 
recently berated you in your office with the charge that you 
favor the Globe reporter with tips on stories. He complains 
that since all board meetings are held at night the Globe in its 
morning edition gets the jump on the Dispatch coming out in 
the evening. 
The press of the city has printed no reports of the actual 
constructive work of the public schools. 
Your teachers are divided into two classes—one with a com- 
plete distrust and fear of the press and the other rashly giving 
their views on all questions of school policy to any reporter. 
You have just had placed on your desk an editorial from the 
front page of the Dispatch which reads as follows:

PROGRESS OR STAGNATION 
If the election were to be held tomorrow, the $350,000 bond issue 
asked for the erection of new school buildings in this city, would 
be defeated, three to one. 
If the bond issue is to carry there must be a tremendous shift 
in popular opinion before November 7th. 
The heavy opposition to the project has resulted, first, from a 
general concentration of all the natural prejudices of voters against 
propositions involving large expenditures and possibly higher taxes; 
and second, from the very strong reaction against the bungling 
methods invoked by the school authorities in attempting to develop 
so-called propaganda in favor of the idea. To this must be added 
the ever-present popular “feeling against the school board.” 
These are unpleasant facts but facts nevertheless. 
Still another strong factor in building up the opposition is the 
quite general belief that our schools should first make a greater 
success of the teaching of fundamentals, before attempting to 
broaden out to include a wide range of vocational work. There 
is a very general expression that the personnel both in the grades 
and in the high school has not been what it should have been, that 
the responsible authorities should first demonstrate their ability 
to organize and maintain more capable teaching staffs in our 
present schools for the fundamental studies, before asking for 
extensive new equipment and expansion. 
These expressions are not without foundation. In recent years, 
it must be admitted, the standing of the city’s schools has deterio- 
rated sadly. Some remarkably able new teachers have been de- 
veloped but no one can deny that the general personnel of the 
schools in the past few years would suffer greatly in comparison 
with the organization of previous periods. This condition in both 
the grades and the high school has been reflected, it is said, in the 
handicaps suffered by even the honor graduates from our schools. 
We believe that the present effort of the school authorities to use 
the teachers and pupils as agencies for propaganda in support of the 
bond issue is daily adding to the vote against the proposition. 
Parents resent this kind of thing. The practice of using the chil- 
dren in the schools as a means of promoting one side of any political 
or religious issue was long ago condemned as unfair. The fact that 
those now in charge of our schools have seen fit to attempt a revival 
of the practice is decidedly unfortunate for the new building 
project. The employees of the school district are the paid servants 
of all voters and while they have every right to exercise their 
 
-P-A-G-E-302
  286 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
personal voting privilege, they are not privileged, in their positions 
as instructors, to use their pupils for electioneering. 
The fact that children often misinterpret what they have been 
told makes the method dangerous to the cause it is supposed to 
help. This has already developed several incidents in the present 
campaign and alone is sufficient to condemn the practice. 
As for the “feeling against the school board.” Within the writer’s 
memory there never has been, and we doubt if there ever will be, a 
popular Board of Education. Whether or not the same is true in 
other cities, the fact remains that for two generations at least, in 
Mirall, the Board of Education has been regarded as a sort of close 
corporation, a star chamber organization, whose slogan was alleged 
to be “the public be damned.” 
We believe that in former years this conception of the School 
Board developed as a result of a lack of publicity in regard to their 
meetings and the discussions and action resulting therein. On the 
other hand there have been instances in which school politics were 
played furiously but in the case of the present Board and its build- 
ing project we believe that the school directors have been and are 
playing absolutely on the level. 
With the paying off of the last indebtedness against the school 
district it became possible to look forward to the erection of new 
buildings, the demand for which had been expressed for years. 
During the last two years the proposition has been generally dis- 
cussed, the Board has given adequate publicity to every move made 
toward a decision, they have outlined a program which appeared 
to meet with favor from the majority. Certainly the building pro- 
gram as decided upon seems to be practical and to ‘fit i in with all 
possible future development of the city. 
So much for the opposition. 
Unpopular though it may be, the “Dispatch” stands strongly in 
favor of the bond issue and the building program. 
We do not express confidence that it will be approved at this 
election by the voters. We hope and urge that it may be. 
To us it appears as an issue between progress on the one hand 
and stagnation on the other. 
On every. side we see other cities both larger and smaller than 
Mirall constantly modernizing and developing their schools along 
with their industrial and commercial development. We see a town 
of half the population of Mirall spending nearly twice the amount 
of this bond issue. 
Are we going to allow the old-fashioned ever- present fear of 
taxation to continue to prevent development of the city? .Can we 
afford to allow our municipal and school district development to
-P-A-G-E-303
  SCHOOL PUBLICITY 287 
remain dormant while private industry assumes new burdens in 
order to develop and progress? 
With the school district now free of indebtedness we believe that 
the Board of Education can successfully finance the project on the 
present tax rate, which is far below the maximum allowed by law. 
But we would still be in favor of progress if it were to require addi- 
tional taxation to go ahead. 
Why let the errors that have been made, the petty bungling that 
has occurred, defeat a major development for Mirall? Let us keep 
in mind the broader, the real issue. Let us build these new schools 
and then let us continue to demand a similar improvement in the 
management of our schools. 
The bond election is to be held three weeks from the day 
upon which the above editorial appears. 
Assignment 
1. Outline the publicity campaign which you hope to carry 
out during the next three weeks. 
2. What part in the preparation of publicity for the news- 
papers would you expect to have taken by supervisors, prin- 
cipals and teachers? 
3. What contributions from children, if any, would you hope 
to have appear in the newspapers? 
4, What special occasions would you arrange for the sake 
of having news stories that would carry support of the bond 
issue? How would you distribute these occasions so as to pro- 
vide stories for the afternoon as well as the morning paper? 
5. What provision would you make by way of preparing 
copy in advance of the speeches made at a luncheon of repre- 
sentatives of each of five luncheon clubs? 
6. What illustrative material would you prepare for the

PROBABILITY 
Problem: The reliability of the several statistical measures is 
determined by applying the mathematical laws of probability 
to the statistical data from which these several measures are 
derived. In this connection it is assumed that the individual 
measures arrange themselves in the normal curve of proba- 
bility, as it is called in mathematics. 
Charts 1 and 2 below each represent such normal curve. 
These charts are so designed that they may be used to deter- 
mine with sufficient accuracy certain facts relating to proba- 
bility and reliability without reference to the complicated 
statistical tables found in textbooks on the subject. They 
have the added advantage of presenting these facts in a graphic 
manner. Your problem is to acquire facility in the use of 
these charts.

  _ PROBLEM 30 
GROUP MEASURES 
Problem: When you have a collection of scores, one for each 
pupil in a class of thirty or forty, you find it hard to reach an 
estimate of the performance of the class until you determine 
some measure of the central tendency of the group. There are 
three commonly used averages, or measures of central ten- 
dency. You are faced by the necessity of knowing how to 
compute each measure, and of understanding just what each 
of the three measures means. 
The central tendency of a group of scores may be computed 
from the “raw” scores allowing each individual score to retain 
its identity, or it may be figured from grouped data. When 
the data are grouped, the individual scores lose their identity 
as a result of recording only the fact that there is a-certain 
number of scores within a given range. In other words, the 
whole range of individual measures is divided off into little 
pockets or pigeon-holes and one records only the number of 
individual measures falling in each pocket. i 
The three measures of central tendency commonly used in 
elementary statistics are the median, the arithmetic mean, and 
the mode. In the tabulation which follows, the scores of three 
classes of thirty pupils each in each of two traits are recorded. 
In the “pupil” columns numbers are used instead of names to 
designate the individuals. Assume that the scores for the first 
two classes—that is, the scores in Columns A, B, C and D—are 
quality or judgment scores, and that those for the third class, 
those in Columns E and F, are quantity or achievement scores.

PROBLEM 40 
SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES 
Problem: A study of certain functions of school expenditure in 
240 American cities of over 8,000 population gave the facts 
presented in the tabulation below. You are required to deter- 
mine whether the differences between the mean expenditure 
per pupil in average daily attendance in certain geographical 
and size groups of cities are differences which may have been 
caused by errors or inadequate sampling from the total groups 
of cities, or whether these differencés are real or significant 
differences too great to be accounted for by error or chance or 
inadequate sampling. 
The data presented on page 298 are the means and the stand- 
ard deviation of the expenditures per pupil in average daily 
attendance for General Control, for Teachers’ Salaries, and for 
Current Expenses in certain American cities for the year 1922- 
1923. In the last column of the table is recorded the number 
of cities in each group. There are 240 cities in all. Cities 
whose populations ranged between 8,000 and 29,999 are desig- 
nated as small cities; those between 30,000 and 99,999 as mid- 
dle cities, and those of a population of 100,000 or more as large 
cities. 
Assignment 
1. Which of the mean expenditures per pupil among the 
total group of large cities, of middle cities, and of small cities 
are significant differences? 
2. (a) What are the chances that the mean expenditure per 
pupil for teachers’ salaries in the Western cities of all sizes is 
really less than the corresponding mean for the Eastern cities? 
(b) Is the $5.00 difference between the teachers’ salaries

PROBLEM 41 
COMPARISON OF GROUPS 
Problem: When given detailed facts concerning the individ- 
uals in two different groups, as in two classes in a school, you 
are called upon repeatedly to compare the two groups by mak- 
ing an analysis of the data presented. When such a study 
shows you that there are differences between the groups, it is 
important to know whether they are chance differences or 
really significant differences not produced by chance or 
accident. 
When two groups are measured with respect to some trait, 
they may be compared in terms of different statistical meas- 
ures which express the facts concerning each group. One basis

of comparison is that of the size of the central tendency of 
each group, whether it be the means, the medians, or the 
modes. A more refined study of the central tendency may be 
made by determining how reliable those data are—that is, by 
determining the probability that the group with the smaller 
average may really have an average larger than that of the 
other group. It is also possible to compare the two groups by 
determining which one of them has its individual measures 
more widely scattered about the average. 
The data presented in the above tabulation are the school 
tax rates for two groups of cities. The data as presented 
are already grouped into steps of 10 cents each, ranging from 
20 cents up to and including $2.39 per $100 full valuation of 
taxable property.

PROBLEM 42 
MEASURE OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS 
Problem: According to Dr. McGaughy’s Fiscal Administration 
of City School Systems, page 35, a group of dependent cities 
was spending more, on the average, for teachers’ salaries in 
average daily attendance than was a corresponding group of 
independent cities. (These facts were for the school year 
1919-1920.) 
Three years later, in 1922-1923, the following cities spent 
the amounts recorded below for the item of teachers’ salaries. 
The cities are divided into Independent and Dependent 
groups and are also classified on the basis of their 1920 
population.

In 1924, the Board of Education and superintendent of 
schools agreed upon the desirability of having outside educa- 
tional authorities make a survey of all the activities of their 
school system. The arrangements have been completed, the 
survey has been made and the report is now in the hands of 
the superintendent of schools. ‘The superintendent is par- 
ticularly interested in the report on silent reading as he has 
been making a special study of this part of the curriculum. 
The survey staff presents a report in this field as follows: 
Three silent reading tests were used for the purpose of checking 
the silent reading situation in the Watson schools. This intensive 
survey of silent reading is justified because of the fundamental im- 
portance of silent reading as a tool subject. The Haggerty Reading 
Examination, Sigma I, was used in grades two and three, the Mon- 
roe Reading Test in grades three to twelve inclusive, and the Bur- 
gess Silent Reading Scale in grades three to eight inclusive. 
The Haggerty Reading examination, Sigma I, is composed of two 
tests. The first test consists of a series of direction exercises ar- 
ranged in ascending order of difficulty. The second part is a series 
of yes-no questions. The score earned is the number of exercises 
answered correctly in 30 minutes for the first test and the number 
of questions answered correctly less the number wrong, for the 
second. 
The Monroe Test consists of three separate tests, Test 1 for grades 
three, four and five, Test 2 for six, seven, and eight, and Test 3 for 
the high school grades. The tests measure silent reading compre- 
hension of a certain type in terms of the total values of direction 
exercises of specified values solved correctly in five minutes. Rate 
is measured by an arbitrary rate score based on each exercise. 
The Burgess Silent Reading Scale consists of a series of twenty 
exercises dealing with pictures. Each paragraph calls upon the 
306

  STATISTICAL METHODS APPLIED 307 
pupil to do some specified thing to each picture. The score is based 
on the number of such exercises marked correctly in five minutes. 
The Haggerty Reading Examination 
Table 1 is a frequency distribution showing the scores made on 
Test 1 of the Haggerty Test by pupils in the second and third grades 
of each of the two ward buildings. This table also shows the city- 
wide distribution of these scores by grades. The table is read as 
follows: One pupil in Jefferson second grade made a score of 3 on 
this test, five pupils in the Monroe second grade made scores of 
zero, eight pupils made scores of 1, etc.

Table 2, which is a summary table, is based directly upon Table 
1. This table shows the number of cases by grades, the grade 
medians compared with the standards, and the comparison of city- 
wide grade medians compared with other comparable data. This 
table reveals the wide differences in silent reading ability in the 
sections of the grades in the Jefferson and Monroe ward buildings. 
The median score for the ten pupils in the Jefferson second grade is  
-P-A-G-E-324
308 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
7.0, and the median score for the 35 pupils in the Monroe second 
grade is 2.2. When these medians are compared directly with end of 
year standards for this test, the differences in the level of silent 
reading ability in these two schools are made much more apparent. 
In general, the sections of the second and third grade found in the

Jefferson School lie much nearer the standard than do the sections 
found in the Monroe School. This is still more significant when it is 
recalled that the general mental level of the groups in the Jefferson 
School was quite consistently superior to the groups in the Monroe 
School. 
The city-wide second grade median for Watson is 3.7 and 138.5 in 
the third grade. When these medians are compared with other city 
medians, it is seen that the second grade assumes second place and 
the third grade assumes the best place. This difference between 
the median of the second and third grade is somewhat significant 
since the improvement from grade two to grade three is much more 
than the standard improvement. The standard growth from second 
grade to third grade is 4 points. The difference between the Watson 
second and third grade medians is 9.8 points. This is not neces- 
sarily to be interpreted as being favorable toward the Watson 
situation, since the median score of 13.5 for the third grade is still 
2.5 points below the standard for third grade. It should be inter- 
preted rather to mean a more unsatisfactory situation in the Watson 
second grade. This is brought about largely through the presence 
of a large number of very inferior readers in the second grade 
of the Jefferson School.

Burgess-Russell Sage Silent Reading Test 
The Burgess-Russell Sage Silent Reading Test gives an addi- 
tional opportunity for checking on the silent reading situation in the 
lower grades. Table 3 is a frequency table showing the distribution 
of pupils by number of exercises answered correctly. The table 
shows, for example, that one pupil in the Jefferson School third 
grade answered five exercises correctly, two pupils answered four 
exercises correctly, two pupils answered zero exercises correctly, 
etc. Contrasted with this, it is seen that 22 pupils in the Monroe 
School third grade solved zero exercises correctly. This table 
lends complete support to the findings presented in Table 1. The 
same outstanding differences in silent reading ability are exhibited 
between the grade sections in the two school buildings as were 
shown for general mental ability. Without exception, the section 
of the grade found in the Jefferson School is decidedly superior.

Table 4 is a summary table based on Table 3. This table shows 
the number of cases by grades, with median scores compared with 
the standard score and with the other city medians. This table 
is read as follows: the 21 third grade pupils in the Jefferson School 
made a median score of 2.25 exercises marked correctly. The 
median score for the Monroe School third grade is .82 exercises
-P-A-G-E-326
310 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
marked correctly, and the city median for third grade is 1.3. It 
must be concluded that the general level of silent reading ability 
as measured by this test is rather low. The situation is especially 
serious in the case of the larger sections of the grades found in the 
Monroe School.

The city-wide results for this test are summarized in the data 
presented in Table 5. This table shows the median number of 
paragraphs marked correctly for each city grade compared with the 
standard number of paragraphs established by the Russell Sage 
Foundation. The median score for the seventh and eighth grade 
obtained from a large number of papers from Wilson, N. B. are 
also presented for comparison. A clear indictment of the low level 
of silent reading ability in the elementary grades so far as this is 
revealed by the Burgess Test is presented in this table. The situa- 
tion is especially bad in grades three and five, being very largely 
brought about through the extremely low level of silent reading 
ability in these grades in the Monroe building.

tween 0 and 38. When these percentages are compared directly 
with the standard percentages and the. percentages obtained for 
the two other N. K. cities, there is a further indication of the low 
level of silent reading ability as revealed by this test.

These data show a slight reversal of previous findings in the sec- 
tions of grade four. The Monroe fourth grade median is slightly 
superior in this case to the Jefferson fourth grade median. The 
same superiority of the Jefferson first grade group is shown, how- 
ever. These comparisons are strictly on the basis of comprehen- 
sion scores. A minimum of emphasis is placed in this report on the 
Monroe Test rate score, since it is believed to be of very limited 
significance. 
The following table, Table 9, shows the per cent that each grade 
median is of the standard for the middle of the year.

This table shows that 100 per cent of each of the third grade 
sections in Watson scored less than 21 points on the test taken by 
them, etc. This table reveals a situation very similar to that 
presented in the foregoing tables. The Jefferson School sections of 
grades four, five and eight thus maintain a slight majority over 
the Monroe School. 
It is interesting to note that the seventh grade people evidently 
do not read as well as the sixth grade people on the same test, at 
least a larger proportion of the seventh grade pupils made compre- 
hension scores of 21 points or less. In general, it must be concluded 
that the silent reading situation as revealed by these three tests 
is such as to demand some immediate attention. The level of     
 
-P-A-G-E-330
  314 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
ability varies decidedly within the school system. Evidently, a 
majority of the pupils responsible for the low scores in the lower 
grades are found in the Monroe School. 
In view of the fact that the general results of the group mental 
tests indicate a considerable difference in general mental level, it 
is probably logical to expect considerable difference in actual 
achievement on the part of these pupils. It is not possible to evalu- 
ate accurately the extent to which the remaining factors, the training 
and experience of the teachers and the emphasis placed upon silent 
reading operate in bringing about these differences in actual accom- 
plishment. Unquestionably one factor tending to reveal the situa- 
tion in a favorable light toward the Jefferson School is the fact that 
it is in itself a smaller school. On the other hand, the teachers of 
the Monroe School are responsible for a single grade. The two 
teachers in the Jefferson School are obliged to work with sections 
of two grades. This undoubtedly is a handicap. 
The criticisms voiced herein regarding the silent reading situa- 
tion are not to be interpreted as being aimed directly at the teach- 
ing staff. This report is merely a statement of conditions. Criticism 
should follow only in case the present teaching staff does not 
succeed in removing certain of the bad conditions which exist now 
or at least succeed in securing a reasonable degree of improvement 
in the near future under proper direction. 
Unquestionably, one of the important factors limiting the develop- 
ment of silent reading ability in the grades is that of the relative 
emphasis which is placed upon these subjects by the teachers in 
charge. In connection with this survey, the teachers of the grades 
were asked to report an estimate of the proportion of time spent 
in oral and silent reading drill. The following table shows the 
percentage of time spent in silent reading by grade and by school: 
TABLE 11. PERCENTAGE OF TIME SPENT IN SILENT READING BY 
GRADE AND BY SCHOOL   
  
Jefferson . 
Monroe 
Lincoln .. 
     
  
It appears from this table and the foregoing data that the addi- 
tional emphasis which the Jefferson School is placing on silent 
reading has borne some fruit: This, of course, must be interpreted 
in the light of the relative mental levels of the two groups. As- 
suming a slightly superior group mentally in the fifth grade, one
-P-A-G-E-331
  STATISTICAL METHODS APPLIED 315 
has a right to expect a slightly greater return in the development 
of the specific ability resulting from a given amount of training. 
Whether the greater consistent superiority in silent reading achieve- 
ment on the part of the Jefferson pupils is the result of superior 
capacity or superior training is difficult to determine. The fact 
remains that their performance as measured by three silent reading 
tests places them in general slightly in the lead in ability to read 
silently. 
Assignment 
1. How would you, as superintendent of schools, expect to 
utilize this report? 
2. In what way could such a report be utilized for the pro- 
fessional advancement of teachers? 
3. What explanation should be made to the Board of Edu- 
cation concerning the wide variation between the Jefferson and 
Monroe schools? 
4, Are the tests used the most reliable tests? What other 
tests would have been available for this purpose? 
5. Is the contrast between the Jefferson and Monroe schools 
to be accounted for in the way explained by the survey staff? 
6. Indicate steps of the supervisory program that a super- 
intendent of schools might be expected to take after a report 
similar to this had been submitted.

SCHOOL BUILDING PROGRAM 
Problem: To plan a building program that will relieve present 
congestions, provide for a modern school plant, and at the 
same time not involve greater expenditure than one may rea- 
sonably hope to secure in the city described below. 
The board of education is elected at large at an annual 
meeting at which parents and taxpayers who are legal voters, 
vote. All financial questions are voted on by taxpayers only. 
The annual budget for current school support is voted at the 
annual meeting. All bond issues for buildings must be voted 
at the annual meeting or a special meeting called by the board 
for that purpose. 
The city has about 13,000 population and they are for the 
most part native born. The valuation for taxation is 
$15,000,000 which is $5,770 per pupil enrolled in school. The 
tax rate for schools is 8.8 mills. The valuation is about 75 
per cent of the actual value. The school budget for next year 
is $200,000. One-third of this amount comes from other than 
local taxes. The entire city tax is 27 mills. Sixty to seventy 
per cent of the people own their own homes. There are three 
parochial schools which enroll about 300 pupils. 
The city is about one and one-half miles by two miles. A 
small stream cuts off one-third of the residence portion. This 
section is accommodated by one school building. Two rail- 
roads cut across the city. The people believe in their schools 
and take pride in them, but are reluctant to build new build- 
ings. A bond issue for a new junior high school to cost 
$450,000 was voted down one year ago by 500 to 1300. At 
the same meeting it was proposed to reduce the budget by 
$5,000 just to show the board that they couldn’t have every- 
thing they asked for. The motion was voted down. Another 
319 
 
-P-A-G-E-336
    320 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
motion was passed adding $2,000 more than was asked for in 
the board’s recommendations. 
There is no school indebtedness and only $250,000 of out- 
standing bonds for civic improvements. 
The city is built up around the central portion. No school 
sites are available down town without wrecking eight or ten 
dwellings. The size of a site in the central section would 
necessarily be limited. The nearest vacant ground is three- 
fifths of a mile from the center of the business district. 
The schools are organized on the 6-3-3 plan with all pupils 
above the sixth grade attending the central plant. 
1. Central School is a three-story brick building, erected in 
1868. There are twenty classrooms and twenty small recita- 
tion rooms. One room on the third floor is double size and 
used for a study hall. Eleven classrooms are lighted from 
both sides and nine from one side, the latter having a window 
surface 15 per cent of the floor surface. The windows are 
located in the ends of these rooms. A gravity ventilating 
system has been provided by ducts leading from steam coils 
in the basement, there being a set of coils for the three rooms 
above. The system is very inadequate, and window ventila- 
tion is used at all times. Heating is by steam radiators. The 
rooms are large enough to accommodate sixty pupils and the 
ceilings are 16 feet high. 
A grade school of 360 pupils is located on the first floor. 
This school uses three portable buildings. The grades extend 
from the kindergarten to the sixth grade and include one room 
for overaged pupils. 
The junior high school is located on the second and third 
floors and enrolls 600 pupils. This school uses two portables, 
three basement compartments for manual training, and the 
gymnasium of the building on the adjoining lot, which accom- 
modates a senior high school of 500 pupils. 
The fire escapes from the third floor are inadequate and 
the danger is great. The building is held in great reverence 
by the retired taxpayers, many of whom went to school in it. 
2. High School Building. The high school building is con- 
structed of surfaced brick and is located on a lot joining the 
Central school. It was erected in 1907 and has nineteen class- 
rooms, four of which are in the basement. It is a two-story
-P-A-G-E-337
  BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT 321 
structure of Class C to Class D construction. The gymnasium 
is on the basement level and the ceiling height puts the study 
hall, which is just above, one-half story above the first floor. 
The study hall seats 300 pupils. The building was planned 
to accommodate 300 pupils. 
The senior high school is located in this building and con- 
sists of 500 pupils. One hundred more will be added in 
September. 
These two buildings care for 1,450 of the 2,600 pupils in the 
system, and have less than 10 square feet of playground space 
per pupil. 
8. Lincoln School. The Lincoln school is a brick building 
consisting of two parts—a two-room, one-story section, and a 
four-room, two-story section, very conveniently joined by a 
fire-proof hallway which furnishes suitable toilet facilities. 
The four-room section is the newer and has been in use for 
more than 60 years. 
All rooms have bi-lateral lighting of an inadequate amount. 
The heating plant is a three-battery furnace equipped with a 
motor driven fan. This furnace is intended to provide heat 
and ventilation, but it is not at all satisfactory. 
The school extends from the kindergarten to the sixth grade, 
and 350 pupils are in attendance. Two portables are used tc 
relieve the congestion. The lot furnishes about thirty feet of 
playground space per pupil. 
4. McKinley School. The McKinley school was erected 
more than sixty years ago, and is of brick construction. There 
are six rooms, two of which were added about thirty years ago. 
One portable is used with this building. Two rooms in the 
older part of the building are too small for more than 30 
pupils, although it is necessary for larger classes to use them. 
The toilets are in the basement and are very insanitary. 
A two-battery furnace with motor driven fan provides heat 
and ventilation. The grades extend from the kindergarten to 
the sixth, and include 280 pupils. 
5. Washington School. The Washington school is a four- 
room brick building of two stories and was erected more than 
sixty years ago. The rooms are too large for forty pupils but 
not large enough to divide, although it has been necessary to 
do so in one instance to take care of the children. Ventilation
-P-A-G-E-338
322 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
is almost entirely from windows. Heat is furnished by two 
hot air furnaces. Toilets are in the basement and hall and 
the cloakroom space is very inadequate. The school extends 
from the kindergarten to the fourth grade, the fifth and sixth 
grade children from this district being sent to Central. There 
are 175 children and the playground space is about twenty 
square feet per pupil. 
6. Garfield School. The Garfield school was built as a two- 
room building more than sixty years ago. Two rooms were 
added about twenty-five years ago. This is a one-story brick 
building with toilets in the basement. One portable is used 
with it. The two rooms of the older part are small and very 
poorly lighted. A two-battery furnace with a motor driven 
fan provides heat and ventilation. The school extends from 
the kindergarten to the fourth grade and includes 190 chil- 
dren. There is less than ten square feet of play space per 
pupil. 
7. Jefferson School. The Jefferson is a cheap brick structure 
built twenty years ago. It is a one-story building of four 
rooms, with a basement half way out of the ground. Two of 
these rooms have been finished and are now in use, making six 
in all. The lighting is bi-lateral and a two-battery furnace 
with a motor driven fan furnishes heat and ventilation. The 
grades are from the kindergarten to the sixth, and include 230 
pupils. The playground provides about sixty square feet per 
pupil. The toilets are in the basement.

The map of the city, inserted here, indicates the location of 
the school buildings now in use, the place of residence of the 
children attending elementary schools from the kindergarten 
through the sixth grade, and certain of the public buildings. 
There are indicated, as well, sites which have been proposed 
for the location of new school buildings. It will be observed 
that one of these sites is near the center of the city on a block 
of irregular shape. The improvements on this block are at the 
present time not very valuable. To the west of the block, 
near the center of the city, is an interior of a block in which it 
would be possible to secure two acres of land and to provide an 
entrance to this interior plot through the purchase of three 
dwelling houses worth approximately $10,000 each. South- 
west of the central portion of the city is a small site just north 
of the railroad where an acre of land could be had at a reason- 
able price. In the south central portion of the city is a large 
open space where it would be possible to secure from five to 
ten acres of land without great expense. In the northeast sec- 
tion are two proposed sites. In either case it would be possible 
to secure from one to three acres without any great expense 
for improvements now found in these blocks. 
In the northwest section of the city is a large open space in 
which it would be possible to secure from ten to twenty acres 
of land without buying improved property. The western sec- 
tion of the city has in recent years been developing fairly 
rapidly with a good type of residences. 
Assignment 
1. With all of the facts listed above in mind, and with full 
appreciation of the conservatism which has prevailed in the 
community, what building program would you advocate? 
2. Locate as nearly as you can the site of any new building, 
or buildings, which you think should be constructed. 
8. Propose the size of building and the schedule of accom- 
modations to be provided. 
4. Propose the development of the program for the period of 
the next fifteen years on the supposition that population will 
increase 30 per cent during this period. 
5. Propose the method of financing the program which you 
have prepared.

PROBLEM 45 
PREDICTING SCHOOL POPULATION 
Problem: What is the best method of estimating the number 
of pupils for which school accommodations must be provided 
during the years which lie ahead? 
One method applicable to the data presented in this problem 
may best be characterized as the multiple factor method. 
1. Basic Assumptions. Use of the multiple factor method assumes 
that: ; 
a. there are many quantitative factors more or less closely 
associated with increase in population. 
b. certain of these factors are peculiarly prophetic in that they 
are indices of sustained capacity for increase in population. 
c. a prediction based upon a larger number of factors or indices 
is more trustworthy than a prediction based upon any single 
index. 
d. in certain situations a prediction based upon multiple indices 
is better than a prediction based upon census population itself 
for the reason that: 
1.) census figures are separated by ten-year intervals. 
2.) census returns are not infrequently erroneous. 
3.) the records for many of the factors are motivated by more 
exacting demands than the recording of the census. 
4.) the census records in many instances do not cover a suf- 
ficient period to provide adequate observation points for 
prediction. 
e. the same factors that have operated over the interval used as 
the basis for prediction will continue to operate, and to the 
same degree, in the future. 
2. Limitations. The reliability of the prediction will be limited by: 
a. the number of factors upon which accurate data are pro- 
curable. 
b. the number of years for which such data may be had. 
c. the consistency of the data.

oe that may be used. Selection will depend upon available 
records and local conditions: 
U.S. Census population. 
. Public school enrolment, total. 
. Publie school enrolment, grades 1-8. 
. Water meter service connections. 
Gas meter service connections. 
. Telephone stations. 
Names in city directory.

. Dwellings, U. S. Census. 
. Application of Multiple Factor Method. 
a. Illustration. For purposes of illustrating the application of 
the method, two factors only are used and prediction is based 
on but five measures:

  b. Processes involved. The prediction based on census popula- 
tion (Column 1) is made after the census method of adding 
one-tenth of the gain in the previous decade (1910 to 1920) to 
each succeeding year from 1920 forward. 
The prediction in Column 2 based on the total public school 
enrolment is arrived at by the following steps: 
1. Determine the number of persons represented by each 
pupil enrolled in the public schools of Pasadena. From 
Table 1, the population for 1920 (45,354) was divided by 
the enrolment (9,521), the ratio being 4.76357525. Then 
to predict the population for 1921 on the basis of public 
school enrolment, the total enrolment (10,937) was 
multiplied by the above ratio, the result being 52,099 
(Table 1A). The same method was used for the other 
years for which data were available; in this case enrol- 
ment could not be carried beyond 1923. Each factor in 
turn is treated similarly. 
2. Increment of Increase. 
In Table 1A, the increase in population predicted from 
enrolment of 1921 over 1920 is 52,099 minus 45,354, or 
6,745 persons. This number (6,745) is the increment of 
increase for that year. For the next year, it is 6,236, and 
for the next, 3,754. 
3. Average Increment of Increase. 
The average increment of increase is the mean of the 
increments given above. In the case of enrolment, the 
mean is 5,577 which is the average annual increase in popu- 
lation predicted from the factor of public school enrolment. 
This average increment of increase is used to extend the 
prediction beyond 1923 by adding it (5,577) to the 1923 
 
-P-A-G-E-346
    328 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
total (62,084) for each year after 19238, that is, for 1930, the 
predicted population would be (7 times 5,577) plus 62,084 
equals 101,123. The same method is used for all the other 
factors and the predictions. 
Elimination of Absurd Predictions. 
In order to safeguard the final prediction figure against 
the influences of extreme cases, only those factors are used 
whose average increment of increase falls within one stand- 
ard deviation of the mean of the mean increments of in- 
crease of all factors projected.

SCHOOLHOUSE PLANNING 
Problem: The situation in Winslow, N. K., a city of 35,000 
population, with respect to the housing of school children 
needs to be reformed. If called in to advise the Board of 
Education, what recommendations would you make? 
The following conditions control the present situation:

2. The Board has no definite building program. 
New buildings are not started until a serious overcrowd- 
ing exists. 
3. There are no sites available for building purposes. 
4, 
5. Present buildings are not built (except the last two built Present sites are too small to permit expansion. 
recently) so that additions could be erected. 
. The school architect is not sufficiently in touch with 
school needs to produce plans for a first-class school build- 
ing as suggested by the Strayer-Engelhardt Standards. 
. The superintendent of schools is so poorly informed about 
the modern educational needs of schoolhousing that he 
cannot give proper counsel from time to time as the plans 
go forward. This means that he is unable to properly 
check, by objective standards, the plans before they go 
to the Board of Education for final approval. 
. No attempt has been made to standardize the materials 
used in construction, neither has there been any attempt 
to standardize the various unit spaces which occur in 
every well-ordered school building. 
The last complete building erected in Winslow is referred to 
in the minutes of the Board of Education as the model for 
future units to be erected as increases and replacements be- 
come necessary. This building is a 22-room structure with a 
large auditorium and stage type gymnasium. The gymnasium

is served by shower and dressing rooms to the rear. Taken as 
a whole, the type of construction and the materials used are 
far in advance of previous structures, and no doubt some 
credit is due to the present administration for taking some 
steps in advance. The purpose of this exposition is to show 
how the building as built actually compares with standards 
which have been well established, as shown by Table A 
following. 
Table A makes two distinct comparisons with the standards 
as formulated by the Committee on Schoolhouse Standards of 
the National Education Association. The first comparison as 
shown in Column B includes a large area of unexcavated base- 
ment. This is included because the footings for the entire 
system of supporting walls has been carried down to basement 
levels as though the intention had been to use this space for _ 
future classrooms. In order to be very generous with the 
administration, a second comparison has been made in Column 
C in which this accessory basement space has been omitted 
and a new base for percentage used. The table, as a whole, 
is self-explanatory. 
TABLE A 
Note: Column A shows the STANDARD TYPES as formulated by the N. E. A. Committee on Schoolhouse Planning. Column B shows the complete floor areas under the various 
headings, together with a column showing their percentage. Column C shows a new_ set 
of percentages figured on a new base omitting the area charged to accessory space which 
in this case is unexcavated basement.

  332 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
Assignment 
1. Are there any definite guiding principles for determining 
the relationship between the Board of Education and the su- 
perintendent of schools on the one hand and the school archi- 
tect on the other, so as to secure future educational efficiency 
in the completed structure? 
2. Should the architect be paid on a salary basis or on a per- 
centage of the contract price for each new building? 
8. If on a salary basis, what should be his duties? 
4, Who should maintain the blueprint file for the Board? 
5. Should the architect make changes in the blueprint rec- 
ords as a building is altered in the future? If so, be specific; 
should the shifting of some pipes or the moving of an electric 
circuit require a change in the drawings? 
6. If the architect is working on new plans on a percentage 
basis, just how many preliminary sketches can he be expected 
to make without an overtime charge? 
7. What fundamental information has the architect a right 
to demand of the superintendent before he starts sketching a 
new building? Should he know the exact building site before 
he begins? 
8. If the superintendent changes his mind a number of 
times, what are the rights of the architect in this case? 
9. In obtaining bids from contractors just prior to the “let- 
ting,” should the plans be issued from the architect’s or the 
superintendent’s office? Should the architect be allowed to 
sit in at the meeting of the Board at which the “letting” is 
made? 
10. During the time of construction, what method is best 
for obtaining proper and adequate supervision, architect’s 
superintendent or special inspector of the Board? 
11. If the Board inspector, then who shall be responsible for 
the “shop drawings’? Where does the architect’s responsi- 
bility cease? If the architect were on a salary basis, would 
there be any difference? 
12. If a survey of the school situation has been made and 
future buildings planned for certain districts, would it be wise 
to make preliminary sketches showing the building which 
would be suitable?
-P-A-G-E-351
  BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT 333 
13. Is it possible to standardize buildings so that one set of 
plans could serve for several structures and thus save archi- 
tectural expense? Can building materials and unit spaces be 
standardized to advantage? If so, why?

PROBLEM 47 
PLANNING A HIGH SCHOOL BUILDING 
Problem: The city of Tatesville has a population of 15,000 
people. It is situated in a southern state and is the county 
seat of Edward County with an area of 500 square miles. The 
total population of the county is 50,000 people. The city is 
located in the Piedmont section at the foot of the Blue Ridge 
Mountains. It is also situated on important railroad lines run- 
ning north and south and east and west. The city is a trading 
center, has a number of cotton mills and is developing rapidly 
along other manufacturing lines, notably in the making of 
furniture. : 
The community has long outgrown its high school building 
and has started proceedings for the development of a new high 
school. The Board has purchased a site of 15 acres which has 
been selected after a very careful study of population growths 
and possible future trends. Architects have been engaged, and 
the following plan has been presented to the superintendent of 
schools for his review and criticism. 
The enrolment and growth and number of teachers on the 
high school staff for the past five years are as follows:

PROBLEM 48 
THE UTILIZATION OF A HIGH SCHOOL BUILDING 
Problem: An appraisal of the utilization of a high school build- 
ing under these conditions: 
1. The administration claims to be badly crowded. 
2. The administration is admittedly running on the policies 
of deliberately keeping sections small and of having ex- 
tensive study hall facilities. 
3. School day six periods of 50 minutes gross each, day being 
by board rules from 8:45 to 12:15 and 1:45 to 3:15. 
4. Semi-annual promotions.

. Finishing off 28, 30. 
. The toilets in the basement are now being remodeled for 
shower rooms, the pupils heretofore having only the two show- 
ers in the physical director’s suites. 
In this connection the superintendent’s recommendations in 
his 1923 report are: 
NEO 
OR 
& 
DD 
The question which we have then is that of modernizing the 
present high school structure by increasing the size of the assembly 
hall by providing a gymnasium on the floor level with the stage and 
for furnishing vocational education. By purchasing the property 
on Academy Street in the rear of the present high school build- 
ing, all the above can be accomplished at a minimum cost. At the 
present time the first floor of the auditorium is located on the 
second floor of the building. If the above mentioned project should 
be carried out, the present first floor would become a first balcony 
and the first floor of the auditorium would be upon the first floor 
of the building. 
The new vocational high school would be constructed upon the 
street in rear, upon Academy Street and joined to the high school 
by corridors. The only rooms used in common would be the audi- 
torium and gymnasium. Classrooms would front on Academy 
Street and be extended back to meet the present high school. By 
ultimately obtaining all the land from the present westerly line of 
the high school extending through to Academy Street down to the 
corner of Jay Street with perhaps two or three plots of ground on 
Jay Street, the vocational school could be enlarged to meet almost 
indefinite requirements of the city. By obtaining at the present 
time the four properties in the rear of the high school, ample 
provision could be made to meet requirements for the present. 
The predominating advantage of this plan is that it would give 
the city a large assembly hall, centrally located, for the least cost. 
It would give both the present high school and the new vocational 
high school a modern gymnasium and would give the vocational 
high school a central location which, in my opinion, is vital to its 
success. By having the two high schools located together, voca- 
tional students desiring to take some portions of courses not pro- 
vided for vocational schools, could do so and conversely, students 
 
-P-A-G-E-360
  
342 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
taking regular high school courses could take vocational work if 
desired. 
The new structure would also provide facilities for continuation 
school and night school classes in trade and vocational subjects. 
The high school principal says that the building was orig- 
inally intended for 500 pupils and the special rooms were 
planned for that number. Various reports of the superintend- 
ent mention that the building was planned so additions could 
be made easily. The high school principal says that such ad- 
ditions have provided classrooms only so that there are now 
classroom provisions for 1,000 pupils but only the original 
special rooms for 500.

PROBLEM 49 
SCHOOL BUILDING PROGRAM 
Problem: You have accepted a position as superintendent of 
schools in Centralia, O., a city of about 50,000 population. 
You have had previous experience as a superintendent in deal- 
ing with school building problems and have had the advantage 
of some professional study in this field. 
You find on coming to Centralia that school building facili- 
ties have fallen far short of the need since the war period. The 
senior high school facilities are fairly satisfactory. There are 
1,000 junior high school pupils in the city with no real pro- 
visions in the way of plant. There are at least 3,000 ele- 
mentary school pupils in excess of the capacity of existing 
buildings. As the schools have actually been administered 
most recently, about 40 per cent of all elementary school pupils 
have been on half time. 
On inquiry and consultation of records to ascertain some- 
thing of past methods of meeting school building crises, you 
learn that (as regards architectural service) each of the fol- 
lowing policies has been employed at some time in the city: 
1. The supposedly best local architect was engaged. 
2. An architect was selected by competition. 
8. A high grade outside architect was selected on reputation. 
4. In the case of the most extensive enterprise, the local 
society of architects was retained and allowed to appor- 
tion the work among its members as it saw fit. 
5. A high grade outside architect was retained as consultant 
to codperate with a not-so-high-grade local architect. 
6. The school board kept a regular school architect in its 
employ; part of the time he merely prepared plans and 
the Board let contracts; part of the time the Board 
through its building department handled all phases of the 
work of construction and maintenance. 
Before attempting an attack on the new problem, you en- 
352
-P-A-G-E-371
  BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT 353 
deavor to compile a list of the different types of workers who 
have at one time or another been involved in determining 
school building construction in this city. In this list you find 
included: 
The State Legislature Heating engineer 
The State Department of Educa- Sanitary engineer 
tion Illuminating engineer 
The School Board Electrical engineer 
The Superintendent of Schools Surveyor ‘ 
The staff of the school system Landscape architect 
Principals Specialists in cost estimates 
An educational adviser from Contractor 
without Subcontractors 
A financial adviser Workmen 
A legal adviser Superintendents of construction 
An adviser on real estate Watchmen 
Architect Bonding company 
Architectural engineer Insurance company 
Specialist in interior decoration 
You are unable to secure full information as to past con- 
ditions of work and the way different plans have worked out, 
and in any case would not be willing to base your decisions 
exclusively on the local experience. But some of the criti- 
cisms and defects attaching to one or more of the past plans, 
which in the future you hope to avoid, are: 
Usually in the past, the educational requirements of the 
situation have been very poorly worked out; sometimes not 
at all. At present there are too many buildings; they are too 
small, too near together, and some are vastly overcrowded 
while a few have unnecessary space. 
Some of the architect selections have been unfortunate. 
Often there has appeared to be a lack of a well-defined 
organization of the work. 
It has not been clear where responsibility rested for all 
phases of the work. 
Some of the most important past work was done on the 
initiative of a “building committee’ of the Board, and the 
superintendent of the schools was scarcely consulted. 
The present Board has confidence in you and has given you 
to understand that the Board looks to you to formulate and 
suggest a general plan of attack on the whole problem. Ac-
-P-A-G-E-372
  
  354 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
cordingly, you are attempting to work out such a general plan 
and expect to include in it such matters as the following: 
A. 
B. 
ye An analytical list of all the different operations involved. This 
list includes such items as: 
Estimating pupil population 
Determination of the educational program 
Determining building units to be created 
Determining kinds of rooms to be included 
Determining layout of educational equipment 
Making plans of buildings 
Incorporating plans in general designs 
Structural design of buildings 
Determining materials to be used 
Planning the mechanical equipment 
Estimating costs 
Arranging contracts 
Selecting sites 
Purchasing materials 
Excavating and grading 
Foundation work 
Brick work 
Etc., etc. 
A determination as to what type of person ought to perform 
each type of work. Here you expect to rely on the principle: 
“Each type of work should be performed by the type of person 
best qualified to perform that work.” 
. A determination as to the general system of organization for the 
whole enterprise. Principle to be followed: “Any natural unit 
of skilled work or codrdinate group of technical activities no 
matter how many persons participate, should have its direc- 
tion concentrated in one expert or professional person with 
power of decision so far as regards the activities of those under 
him.” 
. Definite locating of all needed responsibilities. Principles: 
a. “It is essential that any person on whom responsibility is 
placed should be a person who is competent to carry that 
responsibility.” 
b. “Any person on whom responsibility is placed must have 
powers of kinds and amounts that make it possible for him 
to meet his responsibility fully.” 
. Adequate methods and means of enforcing responsibility. 
. An adequate scheme by which it will be possible for the com- 
munity to be satisfied that the services which it has a right to
-P-A-G-E-373
  
  BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT 355 
expect are being or have been satisfactorily performed; that is, 
a scheme for carrying out an inspecting, reviewing, or approving 
function. Principles: 
a. “The inspection or approval of any piece of work may 
legitimately be done by the person who plans it or assigns 
the work to be done, but not by the person who executes or 
performs it.” 
b. “Every skilled piece of work should have expert inspection 
by a specialist in that line; this applies more particularly to 
work done by a number of different persons; exception: such 
expert review may, if desired, be omitted if the professional 
standing of the performer is such that there would be no 
practical gain or advantage in having further expert inspec- 
tion, especially where only one person of this type is 
employed.” 
c. “Tn addition to expert inspection by a specialist in the same 
line, it is desirable to have a ‘general’ review by a competent 
person who is not a specialist in this line but who represents 
society.” 
Assignment 
1. Do you accept the principles given above under A to F? 
If not all, what substitutions do you suggest and what ad- 
ditions? 
2. a. Complete the list of “operations” under (A). 
b. Make a list of the types of persons who should perform 
the operations (B). 
. Chart an organization scheme (C). 
. State where responsibilities should be located (D). 
. By what devices should responsibility be assured (E)? 
. Formulate a scheme of details of inspection, review, or 
approval, by which the community may be satisfied 
that adequate services have been rendered (F). 
8. Make a summary regarding the proper relation of 
educators to the whole problem. What educators should per- 
form what functions, (a) actual operations, (b) expert review, 
(c) review in capacity of “generalist” representing society, not 
expert in the particular line, (d) other phases?

PROBLEM 50 
OPERATION OF THE SCHOOL PLANT 
Problem: How may a newly elected superintendent of schools 
hope to bring about improvement in the engineering and 
janitorial service of the school system? 
A review of school plant operation in the city of Jamestown, 
N. S., a city of 33,000 population, reveals the following 
conditions: 
1. The administration had no regular inspection of janitorial 
or engineering service. 
2. There were no objective standards set up for such a 
measurement. 
8. There were no definite courses of instruction for janitor- 
engineers, either for beginners or men in the service for a 
period of time. 
4. No records as to personality, age of service and economy 
and efficiency in operation were kept relating to the janitorial- 
engineering force. 
5. No wage scale had been developed to properly reward 
merit and seniority in service. 
Size of Present Plant 
Twelve elementary schools, one high school and one parental 
school comprise the present plant. The buildings range in size 
from four rooms to thirty-eight rooms, with an approximate 
total of 183 rooms. The following table covers the assign- 
ments of the employees by buildings, together with informa- 
tion as to the size of the job, character of the building (old or 
new) and other relating data. 
Present Organization 
The present organization consists of a head janitor on part- 
time and approximately one janitor (or matron) for each 
group of eight classrooms, as shown in the table which follows.

The head janitor reports directly to the superintendent of 
schools and acts for him in matters of detail. New janitors are 
hired with the approval of both parties only. The actual 
supervision of janitorial-engineering service is largely in the 
hands of each building principal. In so far as is determinable, 
there is no overlapping of authority. In many matters, jani- 
tors are allowed to formulate their own methods of perform- 
ance, so that even though the work is performed in a very 
haphazard fashion, there is little if any administrational fric- 
tion in getting the work done. The amount of time devoted 
to supervision by the head janitor is very small and can be 
only a matter of estimate. The major contact of the head 
janitor with his men is obtained in his capacity as foreman of 
the repair and maintenance service of the schools. Whenever 
repairs are being made in any building, the supervision thereof 
may require that a number of trips be made to that school and 
it is at such times that operational matters receive considera- 
tion. It should be said by way of information that the entire

janitorial-engineering force are listed as reserve repairmen and 
that the regular repairmen are held in reserve as substitute 
janitors. Hence, it can be seen that the work of maintenance 
is constantly the major consideration and that the newer build- 
ings not needing attention of this character naturally receive 
very little operational supervision. The workmanship of the 
janitor-engineers has never been reduced to a definite tech- 
nique and uniform results are therefore impossible at the pres- 
ent time. 
Qualifications and Selection of New Janitors 
The present state law requires a competitive examination of 
all applicants for this type of service. The names of the 
highest three on the current list of eligibles are certified to the 
prospective employer from which he must choose one. This 
law is not being enforced at the present time. The scheme, as 
used, is by personal application to the superintendent of 
schools and the head janitor. If approval is secured, the ap- 
plicant is sent to the local civil service headquarters for formal 
registration. The applicant is then ready for assignment to 
of the Board of Education, a number of rules relating to 
the building where he is given verbal instructions as to his 
duties by the head janitor and principal. In the annual report 
janitorial-engineering service are printed along with other 
regulations. In so far as could be ascertained, however, these 
rules are not in the hands of the employees and are not being 
observed in a number of cases. There are many rules relating 
to the necessary duties of building operation that do not ap- 
pear in the present set. The rules as now in force are not 
arranged by function to be performed but are confusingly ar- 
ranged so that it is necessary to hunt through a number of 
paragraphs to find the rule required. A copy of these rules is 
given below and is a rearrangement by function, with sub- 
divisions as follows: I—General Rules. II—Rules Relating 
to Cleaning. III—Rules Relating to Heating and Ventilat- 
ing. IV—Rules Relating to Caring for School Grounds. V— 
Rules Relating to Minor Repair Work. 
I. Genera Rues 
1. The janitors of the schools shall give their entire time to the work 
pertaining to the several buildings and grounds.

There shall be no exception to this rule, except that janitors may be 
absent from the school building at the direction or by the permission 
of the principal. 
Janitors shall be at all times ready to render personal assistance. 
They shall report to the principal at once any injury committed in or 
against the school building or fences by any person or persons.

BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT 361 
V. Routes Rexatine to Minor Repair Work 
1. The janitors shall make promptly such repairs as they are able to 
make, report to the superintendent of schools all other repairs needed. 
Wage and Pension System 
Length of Service: The present janitor personnel ranges in 
period of service from three months to twenty-seven years. 
The question of labor turn-over is not a serious problem, as 
may be seen by looking at the table on page 358. Only one 
person out of the force of twenty-one (5%) has had less than 
one year of experience. With one exception, all of the men 
receive a flat rate of $27.50 per week. No probationary period 
at a lower rate is required on the theory that the rate given is 
a@ minimum amount to meet the present cost of living in 
Jamestown. This is shown also by a study of the minute book 
—which states that the janitor force have appeared as a body 
to petition the Board of Education an@®the Common Council 
for wage increases. As far as is determinable, no dissatisfac- 
tion has arisen because of the equality in wages. 
Sick Leave and Vacations 
At the present time, there is no regulation which governs the 
rate of pay for janitors off duty. Each case is decided on its 
own merits and at the time it occurs. Consideration is given 
to the length of service, the standing of the individual (Note: 
no record except memory for this purpose) and the amount of 
leave previously given (Note: no record available, and not 
shown on pay roll). Leave in case of sickness has been allowed 
as high as eight weeks before deductions in pay were made. 
In addition to the above arrangements, an annual vacation of 
two weeks is granted to each janitor who has been in the serv- 
ice approximately one year or more. 
Pension System 
The state pension system applies in Jamestown, but its ac- 
ceptance is entirely optional with each employee. The law 
provides for laborers, mechanics and clerks who contribute a 
percentage of their salaries according to a definite salary-age 
basis. Benefits are derived by retirement at a minimum age of 
sixty years. Provision is also made for accidental disability, 
ordinary death and of accidental death.

PROBLEM 51 
COMPETITION FOR THE SELECTION OF AN 
ARCHITECT FOR A SCHOOL BUILDING 
Problem: The school committee of the town of Wessex, Conn., 
has found it necessary to erect a new school building on the 
Hartford Post Road and Sound Street. Because of many con- 
flicting local interests, the school committee has deemed it 
necessary to submit its building program to a competition for 
the selection of an architect. What should be included in the 
proposal for the competition submitted to architects? 
The superintendent of schools has set up the following state- 
ment of the building problem and the educational require- 
ments of the building: 
The Building Problem 
Only a portion of the building is to be erected at this time; 
namely, the classroom portions. It is to be designed, however, 
so that at a future date a separate assembly hall and separate 
gymnasium can be readily added, together with additional 
classrooms as may be required. 
The plans and sections should show the portions to be built 
at this time in cross hatching with the future assembly hall, 
gymnasium and classroom addition in outline. The elevations 
of the portion to be built shall be worked up in detail, while 
those portions to be erected some time in the future should be 
shown more or less in outline. 
In view of modern practices and the difficulty of deep ex- 
cavations in rock and possible water conditions, it is recom- 
mended that the area of the basement be-as small as possible 
or eliminated altogether. The building shall be of fireproof 
construction, preferably only two stories high and with a slop- 
ing roof. 
As to the treatment of the exterior design of the building, it 
should be remembered that the Town of Wessex is in New 
363 
 
-P-A-G-E-382
  364 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
England and the traditions of the town are of a colonial char- 
acter. This does not mean an elaborate and expensive ex- 
terior design, as it should be realized that this is a grade school 
building in a rural section and a simple building of good pro- 
portions and constructed of good materials is recommended. 
Inasmuch as the building must of necessity be built in sec- 
tions, careful consideration is to be given the portion to be 
built at this time, so that it will look as nearly like a completed 
structure as possible and at the same time have provisions so 
that future extensions can easily be made, and they in turn 
will have a pleasing appearance. 
Attention is also called to the fact that it is the desire of the 
School Building Committee that this school building be used 
not only by the pupils but by the citizens of the district which 
it serves. In other words, it is to serve a community purpose 
as well as an educational one. The assembly hall, gymnasium 
and kindergarten are the three principal rooms that will be 
used for community purposes, and they shall be made so that 
they can be used separately when desired and easily accessible 
from the outside with as little interference with the main part 
of the school as possible. 
Site 
The site of the building is located on Hartford Post Road 
and Sound Street, Town of Wessex, Conn. 
Educational Requirements of the Building 
The building is to be used as a grade school and will house 
eight (8) grades. It must be planned for the complete re- 
quirements as stated below. For the immediate building op- 
erations, or First Section, the following ten (10) items shall be 
included: 
1. 14 classrooms—accommodating 35 pupils at 18 sq. ft. each. 
Each classroom to have provision for the pupils’ clothing in a 
coat room or wardrobe. Two of these rooms to be separated 
by a folding partition, for use as a temporary assembly hall 
until the permanent one is built. 
2. 1 kindergarten room—approximately 1,000 sq. ft. m area, with 
its own toilet and coat rooms connecting thereto. Kindergarten 
to be located near an exit or to have a special exit of its own. 
3. 1 manual training room—approximate area of 1,000 sq. ft., to
-P-A-G-E-383
& o BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT 365 
accommodate 15 work benches and space for storage of lumber, 
and a small finishing room for the varnishing of finished pieces. 
Please note that the manual training work to be carried on in 
this room will be of the simplest character and no elaborate 
machinery or equipment is necessary. 
1 domestic science room—approximate area of 1,000 sq. ft., to 
accommodate 15 pupils. This domestic science room is to be 
a combined cooking and sewing room, and provision is to be 
made for proper furniture with which to teach the two subjects 
separately. One storage closet each for sewing and cooking 
supplies. 
. 1 principal’s office—with an outer clerk’s office and adjoining 
stock closet. Total area approximately 350 sq. ft. Provide 
toilet in connection with principal’s office. 
. 1 women teachers’ room—approximately 350 sq. ft. in area, with 
toilet connected. 
7. 1 medical inspection room—approximately 350 sq. ft. in area, 
with toilet accommodations and lavatory. 
8. 1 toilet room for girls and 1 toilet room for boys on each floor; 
also necessary drinking fountains properly distributed. 
. 1 store room on each floor for school supplies. 
10. 1 boiler room—the size, location and arrangement of boiler 
room, coal bunker, etc. shall be shown. Ample provision for an 
additional boiler for the future extension shall be made. 
The unit system of ventilation is preferred in so far as the class- 
rooms are concerned. 
co. The coal bunker is to be of sufficient size to hold one season’s 
al supply. It may be built all at one time, or arranged for exten- 
sion when the complete building is erected. 
The requirements for the future extension, or Second Sec- 
tion, are as follows: 
11 
12. . 1 assembly hall with sloping floor—accommodating approxi- 
mately 500 persons. This room may, or may not, have a 
gallery. Stage is to be suitable for use in community plays, etc. 
Moving picture booth to be provided. Fan room for ventilating 
assembly hall may be incorporated in First Section or Second 
Section as seems most desirable. 
1 gymnasium—with approximately 3,500 sq. ft. of floor surface. 
Only the simplest form of physical training will be carried on 
in this room, and there will be no need for locker rooms. Pro- 
vide two (2) shower and small dressing rooms for boys and for 
girls; also instructor’s room and apparatus storage room. 
Gymnasium will also serve as children’s play court when built.
-P-A-G-E-384
  366 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
18. Provide emergency toilet rooms for use of assembly hall and 
gymnasium, when same are used for community purposes. 
14. 12 more classrooms—accommodating 35 pupils each—will prob- 
ably be needed to make a complete school unit, and these are 
to be indicated in connection with the future extension. 
15. Toilet rooms for future extension may be provided in Second 
Section, or toilets in First Section may be made sufficiently large 
for entire building. 
Assignment 
1. In what items do you consider the statement of the 
educational requirements of the building inadequate? 
2. Wherein does the statement of educational requirements 
conflict with the best practice? 
3. Will this statement of requirements make possible a fair 
competition? If not, what other elements should be included 
to insure fairness and to make possible the selection of the 
architect on the basis of the best plan submitted? 
4. Compare this method of the selection of an architect with 
any other method which has come to your knowledge. 
5. Submit an estimate of the time required on the part of 
each architect in fulfilling the requirements outlined. 
6. Is the School Committee justified in permitting the ex- 
penditure of such time without recompense for service ren- 
dered?

PROBLEM 52 
THE HEATING AND VENTILATING OF SCHOOL 
BUILDINGS 
Problem: You have been elected superintendent of schools in 
the city of Maynard, Okla., a city of 25,000 people. As super- 
intendent of schools you are responsible for the school plant, 
both with respect to its operation and maintenance. You have 
under your immediate direction a superintendent of buildings 
and grounds who has had some engineering training and who 
is overwhelmingly committed to a split system of heating and 
ventilation involving forced ventilation. You have just read 
the report of the New York Ventilation Commission. Your 
board has heard of this report and has asked you to report to 
them on the possible improvement in the heating and ventilat- 
ing of the local school building. All of these buildings are 
equipped with the split system. 
Principals and teachers report the buildings as poorly 
heated. They are entirely dissatisfied with the provision now 
being made for the ventilation of the classrooms. Inspection 
reveals the fact that the temperature regulation by thermo- 
stats is exceedingly poor. 
It is also to be observed that the air being delivered to the 
classrooms is filled with dust and dirt. There are no air 
washers in the buildings. The measurement of the relative 
humidity of the air in the several buildings discloses conditions 
in which the humidity is found to be as low as twenty per cent. 
There appears to be very great variation in the volume of air 
being delivered to individual classrooms. In some cases un- 
pleasant odors are constantly present in the rooms. 
It appears that fuel consumption has been excessive. The 
fuel used up to the present time has been natural gas. There 
is no accounting which will enable you to compare the con- 
sumption of gas for each of the several heating plants. 
367
-P-A-G-E-386
  
  368 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
An inspection of the heating plant discloses the fact that 
there is little or no protection around the heating plants to 
interfere with the radiation of heat. In one case hot air is 
blown into the firing room, making it unbearably hot for the 
janitor. In no case had dampers been installed in the stacks. 
A record made at the top of one of these flues indicated a 
temperature of 400 degrees Fahrenheit. In the largest plant 
it was found that the boiler flues in the horizontal fire tube 
boilers were almost filled with soot. Radiator traps were prac- 
tically useless because of rust in the return water. The vacuum 
gauge showed no vacuum in most cases. 
Assignment 
What program of improvement in the heating and ventilat- 
ing of these buildings will you propose and what regulations 
will you ask that the Board of Education adopt?

PROBLEM 54 
PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND HEALTH SERVICE 
Pro blem: The three situations reported in this problem are 
presented from the standpoint of their organization, adminis- 
tration, staff and cost. The job is not analyzed; the service 
to be rendered is not stated. As students of administration, 
you will not, therefore, attempt to pass judgment upon the 
machinery without full knowledge of its functions. A com- 
prehensive bibliography is appended from which you will 
formulate in writing for discussion in class and subsequently 
to hand in, the following: 
1 
2. 
3. . Purpose or purposes of physical education—the ob- 
jectives. 
Purpose or purposes of health education programs. 
The relationship that exists between physical education 
and health education. 
. The range or scope of physical and health education that 
comes within the duties of the public school. 
. The relation of the school’s problem to the problem of 
the Board of Public Health. 
. Concrete data evidencing the magnitude and the impor- 
tance of the problems. 
. A list of the subjects of instruction, devices and agencies 
under the control or at the command of the public schools 
through which the purposes of physical education and 
health programs may be realized. 
In the light of the purposes, relationships and requirements 
you have thus formulated, criticize, evaluate and compare the 
organizations and administrations provided in the following 
three cities.

In addition to the regular activities, a series of health centers 
and day nurseries are operated in the waterfront and neighborhood 
junior high schools. These health centers conduct periodic baby 
clinics and afford an opportunity for girls studying household man- 
agement to actually care for children and learn the rules of hygiene 
and nutrition. The girls in these junior high schools actually care 
for the children, cook for them and learn how to develop their 
health habits scientifically. Day nurseries are handled in connec- 
tion with the junior kindergartens in certain schools. 
Each department has prepared special courses of study.

The city is divided into four districts; each salaried nurse in- 
spector directs the health program in the schools in her district and 
supervises the nurse assistants assigned to her. The nurse assistants, 
numbering from 15 to 30, are registered graduate nurses properly 
certified under the law, who are taking the course in Public Health 
Nursing at the University located in the city. The directors of the 
Department of Public Health at the University have appointments 
from the Board of Education as nurse inspectors, to serve without 
pay. The nurse assistants are not salaried. From 8.15 a.m. to 
11 a.m., the nurse assistants spend in school and general district 
work; in the afternoon, they have courses in theory in Public 
Health Nursing at the University.

Time Allotment 
The state law requires that twenty minutes per day be devoted 
to physical education in all grades up to and including the 8th, and 
120 minutes per week from the 9th to 12th. In the elementary 
schools of City B, grades 1 to 6 inclusive, a 20-minute period of 
instruction in physical activities is organized daily by each teacher 
for her own class. In the senior high school and in two junior high 
schools, pupils are assigned to physical education five 45-minute 
periods per week. In two junior high schools, pupils are scheduled 
only for three periods per week. 
Activities 
The vigorous natural play activities of child life are made the 
basis of the program. The program for the lower elementary 
grades includes singing games, tag games and stunts; for the upper 
elementary grades, the same and the simpler athletic games and 
events; and for the junior and senior high schools, stunts, athletic 
games and events, gymnastic dancing and folk and aesthetic danc- 
ing (for girls). 
Formal corrective exercises are adapted to meet the needs of chil- 
dren requiring correction, and formal drills are used during rainy 
weather when it is impossible to exercise out of doors. The correc-
-P-A-G-E-399
  
PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND HEALTH 381 
tive work is well organized in the high school, but is not done in a 
thorough way in the elementary and junior high schools. This is 
due to an insufficient staff of trained workers. 
Instruction in posture is given in connection with the formal 
work and as opportunities present themselves throughout the day. 
Posture tests are given occasionally by the class teachers and once 
each term by the supervisor of physical education in the elementary 
and junior high schools. 
Leadership 
Instruction in physical training activities in the elementary 
schools is a duty of the grade teachers, and in the junior and senior 
high schools of special teachers of physical education. The latter 
are employed with the understanding that they devote afternoons 
to the after-school athletic activities. The teaching personnel is as 
follows: 
Schools Enrolment Special Physical Education Teachers

Junior High School A 502 2 
Junior High School B 672 2 ag 
Junior High School C 1,063 2 “ —2half-time 
Junior High School D 886 3 G 
Playground Organization 
A highly organized after-school program for intra-mural competi- 
tion is conducted in the junior high and senior high schools. Ap- 
proximately 60 per cent of the pupils are involved in these after- 
school activities. Inter-school competition is conducted for boys in 
the junior and senior high schools, but is subordinated to the intra- 
mural program. Junior high school girls engage in a limited inter- 
school program. No inter-school contests for girls are organized 
in the high school. 
Fifteen of the 17 elementary school playgrounds are supervised 
after school hours by part-time supervisors, most of whom are 
college students. These playgrounds are conducted as community 
playgrounds, but on all of them an organized play-program is con- 
ducted for the children of the elementary grades. 
There are five municipal playgrounds in addition to the above 
which aim to supplement the work conducted by the public schools. 
This correlation is brought about by the appointment of one in- 
dividual who is director of physical education and superintendent 
of playgrounds. In the former capacity, he is employed by the 
Board of Education, and in the latter by the City Playground 
Commission.

    382 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
“Health” Teaching 
Hygiene is not taught as a formal subject, except in the high 
school as noted below. Hygiene is correlated with reading, science, 
home economics and physical education. Emphasis is placed upon 
the development of health habits. In the high school, one of the 
five physical education periods per week is devoted to instruction 
in hygiene, first aid, elementary physiology and anatomy. 
CITY C 
City C, with an average daily attendance of 10,171, reports 
the following organization for physical education and health. 
Department of Child Welfare 
1. Organization 
The work of the child welfare department is classed under the 
following main subdivisions: 
1. Enforcement of compulsory attendance laws. 
2. Administration of the school health program. 
8. Enforcement of the part-time school law and supervision of 
the part-time school. 
4. Issuing of all working permits for minors and vocational 
guidance and placement. 
5. Registration of minors. 
6. Prevention of delinquency. 
2. Division of School Health—Staff, Salary and Relationships

The City Health Department codperates very closely in the 
matter of nurses who go into the home and passes on all of the cases 
excluded from the schools. The County Health Department also 
codperates with the schools that are outside of the city limit. It is 
difficult to figure how much financial aid comes from this source, 
but the assistance is very materially worth while. The county dis- 
pensary renders service to all of the school children in the city

made to the family in accordance with its ability to pay. If free 
treatment is necessary, this is given on the recommendation of the 
Director of Child Welfare.

5. Distribution of Milk in Schools 
The distribution of milk to underweight children in the elementary 
schools is intrusted to a committee appointed by the superintendent. 
Operating through the Child Welfare Department, this committee 
has served each child in the elementary schools who was 10 per 
cent or more underweight and whose parents have granted consent, 
an individual half-pint bottle of milk in the middle of the forenoon 
and afternoon. They also purchase the noon lunch for the Open- 
Air School. Children who can do so pay the cost price of the milk 
received. However, no child is permitted to go without because of 
the lack of means. Through the aid of the Community Chest, milk 
is supplied to children whose parents are unable to pay. A sum- 
mary of the treasurer’s report for the year follows:

3. Physical Education—Teachers’ Meetings and Classes 
Three regular teachers’ meetings were held for each grade 
throughout the year. The work included: 
1. Postural training, grades 1 to 8. 
a. Work outlined and instructions to teachers. 
b. Revision of Posture Syllabus arranged and adopted 1917. 
2. Girls’ activities. Boys’ activities. 
38. Special corrective exercises. ~ . Physical Hducation—EHlementary Schools 
The women in the elementary schools each teach weekly sixty 
groups in ten schools respectively, together with the conducting 
of the volley ball and tennis series for girls. The men in the 
elementary schools teach twenty-one groups each week in ten 
schools and for five nights each week are assigned to work until 
5 o’clock conducting the series of leagues, including two baseball, 
two volley ball, two basketball, one handball and one tennis 
league and a track and field meet in which 450 participated. 
The program of the assistant director of physical education 
included: 
1. Regular program: 
a. Instruction in posture training to each class once through- 
out the year. 
b. Instruction and supervision—girls 5-8 grades—once a 
month. 
c. Instruction and supervision 1-4 grades. Hach class all 
large schools, once a month; small schools, bi-monthly. 
d. Instruction and supervision, John Muir and High School 
girls, two days a week. 
2. Special program: 
a. Direction of May activities. 
b. Supervision and instruction of each class, boys (Grades 5-8) 
excepted once a week, for four weeks, previous to May Day. 
c. Organization of Corrective Centers. Visits as frequent as 
possible for organization of work. 
8. Supervision of organized games and athletics in junior and 
senior high schools. 
4. Organization of corrective program and correlation of the ele- 
mentary junior and senior high divisions. 
This last phase of the physical education program of work which 
has been expanded to the elementary grades this year was most 
important, and was of inestimable value in taking care of the 
percentage of individuals who have growth handicaps which tem-

porarily prevent them from participating in regular activities, and 
if neglected, would be of permanent harm to the fullest physical 
development of these students. At the close of the school year upon 
re-examination of all the corrective cases, it was found that out of 
350 in the various corrective groups, 125 children had improved 
sufficiently to return to their regular physical education activities. 
The cards of the corrective cases in the elementary schools with the 
history of the case and the progress made were given to the cor- 
rective teachers at the junior and senior high schools and the 
necessary continued corrective procedure will be followed upon 
their entry into either of these schools. The interest in this phase 
of work was expressed in many ways. 
1. After the organization of these groups, requests came from 
the parents to place their children in special corrective groups. 
2. Children themselves brought other children who were badly in 
need of posture training to the special posture groups. 
8. Requests from teachers and principals to place additional 
children in the special posture groups. 
. Requests from parents to place children in nutrition classes. 
. Opposition from parents to removing children from nutrition 
classes who did not make sufficiently large gains to warrant 
their continuance in the nutrition classes. 
6. Written and verbal expressions of appreciation from parents 
and teachers for improvement in boys and girls in these groups. oe 
Badge Tests. Twelve hundred and fifty-seven boys and thirteen 
hundred girls completed the badge tests in the elementary grades. 
One thousand and eighty were awarded either a gold, silver or bronze 
badge, having made the required standard in four events. The 
object of this test is to measure the achievements of the pupils and 
improve them. They have more than the incentive of a badge to 
stimulate them to accomplish this work, for they appreciate the 
satisfaction of reaching higher standards in neuromuscular develop- 
ment. The values to them are the development of strength, speed, 
endurance and skill, and the training process involved regularity 
in practice, the exercise of patience and perseverance in reaching 
the goal.

PROBLEM 55 
THE ADMINISTRATION OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION 
Problem: In the city of Boardston, N. K., there is a population 
of 20,000 people. Up until the present time, the school au- 
thorities have made little progress in the development of the 
program of physical education. The Boardston Community 
Recreation Association has undertaken a program of physical 
education outside of the schools and has been fairly successful 
in giving opportunity for recreation and play to both adults 
and children. 
Mr. Thomas Gunther, superintendent of the Boardston 
schools, is in receipt of the following letter from the secretary 
of the Community Recreation Association. 
Mr. Thomas Gunther 
Superintendent of Schools 
Boardston, N. K. 
My pear Mr. GunTHER: 
In order that you may have the opportunity of considering this 
proposed plan for codperating with the School Board before we 
meet to discuss it, I am enclosing this outline of a tentative 
schedule together with the following suggestions: 
The Recreation Association will furnish a sufficient number of 
qualified supervisors to conduct physical education in those schools 
in which the School Board does not plan to place employed physical 
education directors. 
The Recreation Association will suggest that the School Board, 
instead of employing any additional physical education workers, 
make provision in its next budget for paying either a lump sum 
or a pro rata amount to the Recreation Association for the direc- 
tion and conduction of a physical education program in the public 
schools. 
Such a plan works very successfully in many cities, and has the 
strong economic appeal of eliminating duplication of overhead and 
of supplying better workers for less money. It would be to our 
mutual advantage, as we both would benefit from having one 
recreation system which employed the physical education workers 
393  
-P-A-G-E-412
  394 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
for the schools and used these same competent workers on the play- 
grounds in the afternoons and during the summer vacation. 
The cost to the School Board would not be more than half of 
what it would cost the School Board to direct and conduct a similar 
program. The Recreation Association would benefit in that it could 
employ better qualified workers on a full-time basis. And the 
children would benefit more from such a program because of the 
centralized control of the work and because they would receive 
training from more efficient workers. 
With more than 33 states now conducting a program of physical 
education, it will be but a comparatively short time until N. K. 
will take its place among the more progressive states. In fact, the 
state superintendent will, I have been given to understand, en- 
courage the introduction of physical education in the N. K. public 
schools this coming school-year. Boardston has already made a 
start in this worth-while work, and we now have the opportunity 
to place it upon a more efficient and effective basis. 
Physical education requires the services of specially trained and 
experienced directors. To be successful in any school, the program 
must have the loyal and active support of the principal and teachers. 
I shall be pleased to go into further detail concerning this schedule 
and the suggestions at your convenience. It is my intention to get 
away for a vacation by the end of this week, if possible. 
Sincerely yours 
Epwin C. BricHt 
Director Public Recreation. 
The following tentative program for physical education in 
the grade schools was submitted by Mr. Bright:

PROBLEM 56 
HEALTH SERVICE AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION 
Problem: Claremont, N. Z., is a city of 130,000 population. 
The average daily attendance in the public schools last year 
was approximately 22,000. Twelve thousand of these pupils 
were in the kindergarten and elementary schools, 4,500 in 
junior high school, and 2,600 in senior high school. The re- 
mainder of the pupils were in special schools such as vocational 
and continuation schools. It has a dependent board of educa- 
tion; that is, the municipal government of the city passes upon 
the annual budget of the board of education, appropriating 
for school purposes whatever amount of the local tax revenues 
it may see fit to devote to the schools. 
The health service for the public schools is organized on this 
same basis of close interrelation between the schools and the 
city government. As a result of this lack of centralization 
under a single authority, there is much duplication and wast- 
ing of energy in these two agencies which are concerned with 
the health of school children. 
As superintendent of schools in Claremont you feel that it 
is necessary to recommend a reorganization of the entire health 
_and physical education service for the school children of the 
city. 
The present organization of the health service in the public 
schools is shown in Chart 1. In this chart, the lines connecting 
agents with pupils or parents indicate that these officers come 
into direct contact with them. Physical education teachers, 
regular teachers and open-air classroom teachers have various 
duties concerning health conservation. As shown in the chart, 
the principal is the superior officer who directs and codrdinates 
their activities. On the other hand, dentists, school nurses, 
medical inspectors and special nurses are also in-touch with 
children directly. Their superior officer is nominally the health

physician who, as executive officer of the Board of Health in 
professional activities, is in charge of medical inspection of . 
school children. Single lines connecting him with these of- 
ficers indicate this relation. However, it is well known that 
for real control a superior officer must have power to remove

  for incompetency or insubordination and for the best loyalty 
should have the appointing power. Double lines show ap- 
pointing power to reside with the Board of Health, of which 
the health physician is but one of three. The dotted lines, 
showing removing power residing with the mayor with the 
approval of the Board of Aldermen, indicate that the control
-P-A-G-E-417
PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND HEALTH 399 
which either Board of Health or health physician has over 
nurses, physicians, or dentists, is actually no more than the 
power to draw up sets of rules and suggestions—but not to 
enforce either. 
School agents render aid to Health Department agents in 
various ways. The classroom files of the physical education 
teachers and of the classroom teachers are used by the Health 
Department agents and school principals and teachers render 
any possible service by making available whatever information 
they may have which is of value to these municipal agents. 
The following services are rendered to public school children 
by the agents of the Board of Health, as reported in a recent 
survey. 
1. Annual examination of school children in grades 1 to 9 
inclusive. This examination is often not given at all. For 
example, the 1922 Annual Report of the Health Department 
reports that 16,464 pupils were examined out of 27,996 in the 
public schools.’ No attempt is made to examine high school 
pupils. A survey of examination record cards held in class- 
room teachers’ files indicates that the record, when made, is 
almost without value. 
2. Vaccination of first grade or entering pupils. A special 
study should be made to determine whether the 1,001 vac- 
cinations in 1922 were adequate. 
3. Bi-weekly visits to schools by medical inspectors for 
diagnoses of pupils’ ailments. 
a. In 1922, 14 medical inspectors made 12,754 examinations 
and diagnoses, or an average of less than four examina- 
tions per scheduled school visit. The inadequacy of this 
record is best realized when comparisons and special in- 
vestigations are reported. A special study should be 
made to determine whether the statement of one prin- 
cipal that “the medical inspector did not come into my 
building until the last day of school” is representative. 
b. High schools receive no service from the Board of Health 
whatsoever. 
4. Dental service. Three dental dispensaries are located in 
1 Enrolment: Day Schools, 23,621; Evening Schools, 3,577; Continuation 
Schools, 798. 
 
-P-A-G-E-418
400 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
school buildings giving the following service between the hours 
of nine and twelve daily: 
a. Complete treatment, including instruction in dental hy- 
giene, for all second grade pupils whose parents are un- 
able to provide treatment or who prefer the school dentist 
to others. 
b. Complete treatment for all pupils in special classes, i.e., 
open-air schools. 
c. Emergency treatment for those with bad aches, swollen 
cheeks, etc. 
d. Talks and demonstrations in classrooms by assistants. 
This service, except (d), is provided only with the parents’ 
written consent. No service otherwise is given beyond the 
second grade, even though the medical inspector may report 
and record teeth as “poor” year after year on the physical 
examination record blank. This limitation of dental service 
indicates that the basic principles for the establishment of such 
a service are being ignored. 
5. School nurse service. Ten nurses give “full time” serv- 
ice, dividing their time among 28 schools. Each nurse visit 
each of her schools at least once each school day to report to 
the medical inspector or to examine and treat pupils sent to 
her by classroom teachers, and to visit homes of children need- 
ing treatment for the purpose of urging parents to take proper 
action, also helping those pecuniarily embarrassed to obtain 
financial aid. 
The school nurses provided by the city do highly com- 
mendable work, but they are too few in number to handle th 
situation adequately. In addition the Board of Health fails 
to provide any nurse service in some schools or visits to class- 
room for drills and instruction in personal hygiene. . In general 
the health service provided for the school children of Clare- 
mont is inadequate at almost every point. Annual examina- 
tions in many cases are not given at all and the records of such 
examinations are kept in such a way as to be almost useless. 
Oftentimes bi-weekly visits of the medical inspectors are ok 
made at all. No medical service is given beyond nurse servic 
and vaccination. Dental service is confined to the Taerotaes 
limits imaginable. The total cost of the health service pro: 
vided by the city Board of Health amounted to $1.50 per eee

in average daily attendance last year. Among twenty-five 
comparable cities there were only five which expended a larger 
amount per pupil.

    PROBLEM 57 
SCHOOL SEATING 
Problem: To establish the nature of a permanent continuing 
inventory for school seating, and to indicate how such an in- 
ventory should be used. |   After numerous complaints had been made from time to. 
time by various persons in the school organization, the super- 
intendent of schools at Burlton, N. K., decided that some ac- 
tion would be necessary to take better care of the school 
seating situation. 
Complaints of this kind were received from principals and 
teachers—that the desk size distribution did not fit the needs 
of children; from janitors—that certain types of desks were 
always getting out of order and requiring extra time for repair; 
from the building supervisor—that the frequency of demand 
for changing of seats involved too great a waste of time; from 
the purchasing agent—that the principal of a new building 
was dissatisfied with the furniture installation although his 
exact requisition had been followed. 
‘The superintendent felt that these complaints were of such 
importance that the matter should be brought before a meet- 
ing of teachers and principals. He also held conferences with 
the various officers whose work was involved. 
As a result of these meetings, a committee was appointed to 
study the problem and make a report of their findings and 
recommendations. The committee consisted of the assistant 
superintendent of schools as chairman, the principal of the 
high school, a principal of an elementary school and the build- 
ings and grounds supervisor. 
     
       
           
   
      
-P-A-G-E-421
  PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND HEALTH 403 
The committee reported as follows: 
A. FINDINGS 
1. Furniture has been ordered by estimating the number of seat- 
ings required for each grade and then choosing the sizes shown 
in the furniture catalogs of various manufacturers. This has 
resulted in an accumulation of certain sizes in excess of needs. 
2. Each building has been treated as a unit in the past and in 
most cases there are many extra seatings stored away in the 
basement and under the stairways. Most of this furniture is 
in good condition or can be made so by slight repairs. Of 
course, it is only natural that the best furniture in the building 
should be in service. 
3. There are too many types of furniture in use apparently to 
make possible superior equipment management. 
4. A visit to all of the school buildings revealed the fact that 
many children were improperly seated and that the posture of 
the pupils was very poor indeed. 
5. The repair and refinishing of furniture is all done in the 
summer time when the rush of other work makes it impossible 
to give proper inspection to the repairs done. The men used 
for this work being transients are not subject to training. 
6. It was found that in many cases new furniture, being delivered 
direct to the building, would have parts broken or tops 
scratched and that no notice was made so that damage claims 
could be collected from the railroad. 
Summary: From all the facts collected, it seems evident that 
nothing constructive has been accomplished in the past and that 
many changes will be necessary before a reasonable degree of 
efficiency can be accomplished. 
The recommendations of the committee follow below: 
B. RECOMMENDATIONS 
1. That the assistant superintendent of schools in charge of busi- 
ness affairs shall continue to act as the chairman of the com- 
mittee and the committee shall be subject to his call as 
required. 
2. That some means be worked out for knowing exactly how 
many seatings of a given style and size are now in the various 
buildings. That a scheme be worked out to keep this infor- 
mation continuously so that the superintendent of schools can 
obtain any information as to style, size and age of all school 
seatings directly from office records.
-P-A-G-E-422
404 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
3. That the teacher and child should both know what is correct 
as to proper posture and seating of pupils. There should be 
means available at all times for measurement of children. 
4. A standard should be set as to how often children should be 
measured. | 
. Someone should be placed in charge of measurement and 
adjustment of children and seatings. 
6. After the work of measurement and adjustment has been 
carried as far as is possible within any one building, it should 
then be possible for the principal of the building to call for 
aid from some central place so that exceptional cases can be 
taken care of and adjusted. | 
. A suitable schedule for the repair and refinishing of furniture 
should be developed so that the work can be spread over the 
entire year and done by regular employees subject to trainin; 
and discipline. No doubt better methods of refinishing can b' 
developed so as to cut the unit cost. 
. In order to facilitate the plan as a whole, it will be necessary 
to design a set of forms, minimum in number, to accomplish 
the continuous inventory. These forms will naturally include 
the purchase, distribution, repair, and refinishing of furniture. 
. That all possible speed be made to correct the outstanding in- 
efficiencies of the present scheme. or nq oo © 
Assignment 
  1. Measured as a percentage of the entire school plant, how 
important is the problem of school equipment? What does 
this mean in actual dollars in a school system in a city of 
10,000 people? 50,000 people? 100,000 people? 
2. In what respects are you in disagreement with the fol- 
lowing statement of executive responsibility? Explain. | 
“The chief executive officer should be responsible for develop- 
ing standard practice and procedures for— 
A. The budgeting of new equipment and the replacement of 
old equipment. 
B. The purchase of new equipment; the repair or disposi- 
tion of old unserviceable equipment. 
C. The receipt, delivery and storage of new equipment, old 
equipment awaiting repairs, and repaired equipment. 
D. The accounting of equipment, as to— 
a. Original costs by schools, department or kind of 
service rendered and unit costs in types of equipment.

b. Insurance and depreciation. 
c. Desirability, utility and ultimate cost. 
d. Its contribution in determining new standards. 
e. Responsibility and accountability as to defacement, 
destruction and loss. 
f. Labor and material costs in repair. 
g. A permanent inventory of all equipment, so organized 
as to be most convenient for periodical checking and 
budget-making. 
E. A systematic inspection of all equipment. 
a. A properly trained and organized staff for repair of 
equipment.” 
8. Is this an acceptable principle of equipment manage- 
ment? 
“Capital in the form of equipment should be as accurately and 
thoroughly accounted for as cash itself.” 
4, Comment on this requirement: 
“All equipment should be properly marked with a permanent 
and fixed label for ready inventory and convenience in record.” 
What form should this marking take? 
5. In the purchase of equipment, standard specifications 
should be established and should be continually in the process 
of further development. Outline a form which may be 
followed.

The teacher’s register of pupils belonging to her school shall con-

enumeration list at the opening of the school by the board of educa- 
tion, and such additions as may be made thereto during the term, 
and no child shall be counted as not belonging to the school unless 
upon investigation by the local attendance bureau or the proper 
school official, it shall be found that the child 
1. Is deceased. 
2. Has moved from the district. 
3. Is enrolled in another school. 
4. Is legally employed upon a General Employment Certificate or 
an Exemption Permit. 
5. Is 16 years of age or over and has withdrawn from school. 
6. Has been certified by the medical inspector as permanently in- 
capacitated and not a fit subject for education and training. 
7. Holds superintendent’s certificate showing the completion of 
the work of the elementary school, resides two miles or more 
from any high school and transportation is not provided. 
The directions for summarization and statistical interpreta- 
tion are as given below: 
To find aggregate number of days belonged, total column “days 
belonged during month.” 
To find aggregate number of days attended, total column “days 
attended during month.” 
To find the percentage of attendance during the month, annex 
two ciphers to the aggregate number of days attended during the 
month and divide by the aggregate number of days belonged. 
To find average daily attendance, divide aggregate days attended 
by the number of days school was in session. 
It will be noted that the state is working on the general prin- 
ciple that the percentage of attendance should measure the 
completeness with which school facilities of a district have 
been made available to every child of school age within the 
district. By school age is meant children who, according to 
law, are enumerated and are expected to attend; that is, in 
this case, the group between 6 and 16 years of age. This means 
that the school is held responsible for every child of school 
census within the compulsory age limit. The compulsory at- 
tendance age is from 8 to 16 years in this state. Children 
between 6 and 8 not under the compulsory attendance law 
must be reported as absent even though they do not attend. 
Under these regulations, a child is not dropped when he is
-P-A-G-E-429
  CENSUS AND ATTENDANCE 411 
absent from school unless it is for one of the several reasons 
enumerated above. If a child is sick and is absent three 
months, he is still an educable liability, his name is continued 
on the roll and he is marked “absent” during that period. 
Assignment 
1. Discuss the effect of this regulation upon the percentage 
of attendance for school systems. 
2. Indicate other common methods of estimating percentage 
of attendance. From the literature on school attendance, dis- 
cover the various measures of attendance which are commonly 
utilized. Show the need for a common definition of these 
measures, 
3. Can the Owasco method of reckoning attendance be con- 
sidered a fair measure of school administration within the 
state? 
4. What is implied in the way of organization before the 
commencement of school each year if the Owasco plan is 
utilized?

State School Law 
Sec. X: Required attendance upon instruction. Every child 
within the compulsory school ages as herein prescribed, in proper 
physical and mental condition to attend school, who resides in a 
city or school district having a population of four thousand five 
hundred or more and employing a superintendent of schools shall 
regularly attend upon instruction for the entire time during which 
the schools of such city or district are in session as follows: 
a. Each child between seven and fourteen years of age 
b. Each child between 14 and 16 years of age, not regularly 
employed... . 
Attendance Officer 
At the present time one attendance officer, well along in years, 
constitutes the attendance department. He holds this office as a 
promotion from a janitorship at an increase of salary to do the 
work of the attendance officer. All records are kept in a small 
“black” book which he carries with him at all times. The book 
apparently serves for one year, although the present book has seen 
longer service. At the end of the school year, the contents are laid 
away as a record of original entry. The attendance officer reports, 
however, that transcripts of these records are made from time to 
time at his home. These summaries are used in the makeup of the 
Superintendent’s Annual Report. No other records appear to be 
available. 
Methods Employed 
Whenever necessary, principals telephone the name and address 
of a truant to the superintendent’s office. A note regarding the 
case is placed on a vacant desk near the telephone and these notes 
are used as the assignment for the day by the attendance officer. 
The black book shows an average of 17 reported cases each day. 
From the superintendent’s annual report, it is evident that all cases 
are investigated with a rather high degree of adjustment between 
 
-P-A-G-E-434
  416 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
the cases reported and the officer’s ability to investigate. He 
endeavors and probably does visit every school once a week. In 
going about the city, he has the use of his own bicycle and auto- 
mobile but generally makes his rounds on foot. He shows by his 
attitude towards his work that he wants to serve well the school in 
his capacity as truant officer. For a week he stood outside one of 
the new schools at the opening of the morning session in order 
that his presence might serve as a deterrent to the habitually tardy 
pupils. 
Records and Reports 
His one general report made to the superintendent at the close 
of the year gives: 
. Cases reported by the superintendent 
. Cases investigated 
. Visits to schools 
. Truants arrested 
. Parents arrested 
. Number of parents fined 
  The source of all these records is uncertain. Memory plays a 
rather important role in their compilation. 
By a careful and close scrutiny of the “black” notebook, one 
might gather some slight details regarding the causes of absence. 
Oral reports to the principals, after a case has been investigated, 
are recalled when the same case appears on the truant list. The 
attendance department as such has no adequate system of records, 
the officer being confessedly unable to keep or supervise the keeping 
of records. All records at the present time are at the home of the 
attendance officer. 
Transfers of Pupils 
Pupils seeking transfers are told to report to the superintendent’s 
office for a transfer card calling for information as shown here.

CENSUS AND ATTENDANCE 417 
If the child does not get a card or appears at the school without 
one, the receiving school sends in a request for the card to the 
superintendent’s office. The card is then sent to the school by the 
janitor when he comes to the high school for the semi-monthly pay 
checks for the teachers of his school. There is no doubt an atten- 
dance loss by this method of transfers. A file of the duplicate trans- 
fers is kept in the superintendent’s office. No check, however, is 
made with the schools. When a child transfers to a parochial 
school, his census card is taken out of the general file and placed in 
the parochial census file. In case the child leaves the parochial 
school without transfer or working papers, he is lost from the 
general census. Transfers are reported by one school only. 
School Census 
Up to 1917, a school census was taken every second year. Since 
1917, when a “teacher taken” census was completed, a so-called 
continuous census has been in operation. The state law regarding 
school census is found in Article X, Section Y. 
“The board of education of each city of the second class and each 
city of the third class shall constitute a permanent census board in 
such city. Such board shall, under its regulations, cause a census 
of the children in the city to be taken and to be amended from day 
to day so that there shall be on file with such board a complete 
census giving facts and information required in the census provided 
for in Section 650 etc.” 
Once a month, teachers send in notes regarding: 
1. Changes of address 
2. Transfers from one school to another 
8. Number becoming fourteen years of age 
4. Number leaving school for employment 
5. Number leaving the city ; 
None of these reports are available since they are destroyed as 
soon as record has been made, if made at all. 
The census cannot be considered a continuous census in the 
accepted meaning of the term. No real check is made upon the 
school population even immediately after the official enumeration. 
Transfers to and from other cities are carelessly made, and many 
pupils in transferring from one school to another within the city 
must fall by the wayside. At one time the records of the Bureau 
of Vital Statistics were used to check the children becoming of 
school age. This is no longer done. Neighborhood interest is the 
source of a large part of the information by which trace is secured 
of new entries to the city or delinquent children.

PROBLEM 60 
BIRTH CERTIFICATION AS RELATED TO SCHOOL 
CENSUS 
Problem: The determination of the value of birth certifica- 
tion as a means of securing and maintaining an accurate and 
complete school census. 
Chapter 10 of the State Laws of 1915 
Sec. 108. Registration of Births—The birth of each and every 
child born in this state shall be registered within five days after 
the date of each birth, and there shall be filed with the registrar of 
the district in which the birth occurred a certificate of such birth 
which certificate shall be upon the form prescribed therefor by the 
state commissioner of health. In each case where a physician, 
midwife or person acting as midwife, was in attendance upon the 
birth, it shall be the duty of such physician, midwife or person 
acting as midwife, to file said certificate. In each case where there 
was no physician, midwife or person acting as midwife, in atten- 
dance upon the birth, it shall be the duty of the father or mother of 
the child, the householder or owner of the premises where the birth 
occurred, or the manager or superintendent of the public or private 
institution where the birth occurred, each in the order named, 
within five days after the date of such birth, to report to the local 
registrar the fact of such birth. In such case and in case the 
physician, midwife or person acting as midwife in attendance upon 
the birth is unable, by diligent inquiry, to obtain any item or items 
of information required in this article, it shall then be the duty 
of the registrar to secure from the person so reporting, or from any 
other person having the required knowledge, such information as 
will enable him to prepare the certificate of birth herein required, 
and it shall be the duty of the person reporting the birth or who 
may be interrogated in relation thereto to answer correctly and to 
the best of his knowledge all questions put to him by the registrar 
which may be calculated to elicit any information needed to make a 
complete record of the birth as contemplated by this article, and 
it shall be the duty of the informant as to any statement made in 
accordance herewith to verify such statement by his signature, when 
requested so to do by the local registrar.

Other rules affecting the filing of certificates are as follows: 
All births in the State of N. K. are to be registered on this 
blank. This includes not only all living births (children born alive) 
but also all stillbirths (children dead when born) provided that the 
latter (stillborn) need not be resistered unless advanced to the 
fifth (5th) month of uterogestation. Stillbirths must be registered 
as births, upon this blank, and also as deaths, upon the Standard 
Death Certificate, and a burial permit issued in the regular way. 
See extracts from the law. 
All birth certificates (including those of stillbirths) must be 
FILED with the Local Registrar of the town, village, or city in 
which the birth occurred within five (5) days thereafter. Note that 
the certificate must be filed; it may be mailed, at the risk of the 
sender, but to mail as late as the fifth day after birth does not com- 
ply with the law unless the certificate actually reaches the Local 
Registrar within five days from the date of birth.
-P-A-G-E-441
  CENSUS AND ATTENDANCE 423 
These certificates form the Legal Records which may be of great 
importance to the children born. It is essential that they be com- 
plete and correct when filed, because no alteration or erasures will 
be permitted after they become a part of the State Records. Hence 
Registrars are instructed to refuse certificates— 
(1) Omitting information required by law; 
(2) Not written throughout “legibly, in durable black ink” as 
the law expressly requires; 
(3) Mutilated, grossly soiled or defaced, inaccurate; 
(4) Containing any erasure, interlineation, correction, or altera- 
tion of anything printed or written upon the certificate. 
Note—If a mistake is made and observed before the certificate is 
accepted for registration, another blank may be filled out correctly 
and substituted for the erroneous certificate; but no certificate of 
birth or death after its acceptance for registration by the registrar, 
and no other record made in pursuance of this article, shall be 
altered or changed in any respect otherwise than by amendments 
properly dated, signed and witnessed. (See Sec. 276.) 
A blank (Form TR No. 22) will be supplied by the Local 
Registrar or State Department of Health for the legal correction of 
an erroneous birth record.

here. Entries are made by the local registrar and at the 
close of the year, December 31, are filed with those of preced- 
ing years. Mythical data are supplied. 
Assignment 
1. Are the records of birth certification used by school su- 
perintendents in securing and maintaining a continuing census 
of all children from birth to 21 years of age? 
2. In a normally growing American city, approximately 
what per cent of a city’s six-year-old group would be accounted 
for in the birth records of the six-year-old group? 
3. In case the birth records are made the major source of 
information in the construction of a census roll, what supple- 
menting agencies could be made—through legislative enact- 
ment—to account for and furnish information of— 
a. Children coming to town after birth? 
b. Withdrawals from the city not accounted for by the death 
certificates? 
c. Change of residence within the city? 
4. If the superintendent should take advantage of the in- 
formation made available by birth certification, when and how 
and where should he get the record of a birth? The following 
is suggestive of various answers: 
a. Go to the office of the local registrar annually or more 
often and there copy the records. 
b. Have the report of the births sent to the superintendent 
instead of the registrar. 
c. Require a duplicate of the original birth certificate to be 
sent to the superintendent at the time the certificate is 
filed with the registrar. 
d, Require by law that the registrar shall promptly, upon 
recording a birth, send a copy of the recorded facts to the 
superintendent. 
5. What other use could be made of the information re- 
ceived on the birth certificate than that use which is made of 
it in connection with the census? 
6. Would additional data be of advantage to a superin- 
tendent? 
7. If the answer to number 6 is “yes,”’ what should be the 
character of the additional data?

PROBLEM 61 
PROBLEMS IN NON-ATTENDANCE 
Problem: To ascertain the procedure to be followed in special 
types of non-attendance problems. 
CASE 1 
Russian families living in Northrup, a middlewestern state, 
have contracted with a sugar beet firm to furnish labor in the 
beet fields during the months of May to October. Parents 
withdraw or have their children stop school on the first of May. 
Pupils do no re-enter until the first of October. Children are 
not in attendance during the month of May or September of 
a nine-months school term causing considerable retardation. 
1. Should parents be compelled to keep their children in 
school the full term? 
2. Should special classes be organized for these pupils to 
make up the work missed? 
3. How would you determine the promotion of these pupils? 
CASE 2 
Mrs. Cropsey is a slovenly, irresponsible widow with five 
children in school. She is supported to a large degree by the 
city and charitable organizations. No one has been able to 
discover that she has any interest in the education of her chil- 
dren. Even after many weeks of intelligent and diligent effort 
on the part of the truant officer and school nurse, her children 
are absent from school for trivial reasons. 
1. Should her case be taken to court? In case a fine is im- 
posed, what is gained? 
2. Should the children be taken from her and put into an 
institution? 
3. What are other methods of handling this case?

-P-A-G-E-445
  CENSUS AND ATTENDANCE 427 
CASE 3 
During the canning season, a large Italian population is 
transferred to the village of Union Springs from a large metro- 
politan center. This is unskilled labor which is utilized in can- 
ning vegetables and fruit crops brought in from the farms of 
the immediate vicinity. 
Union Springs has a permanent population of about 5,000 
with a school population of 1,200. The town is largely resi- 
dential in nature, the population being from old line well-to-do 
families. The one factory is owned and operated by the State 
Canners’ Association much to the annoyance of the villagers 
who do not like its noise and odors. 
The imported Italians bring in their whole families for the 
canning season only and live in shacks on the property of the 
canning factory. The children of school age are out of school 
during the month of September and part of October. The 
villagers object to their being included in the village schools. 
These children are not even included in the school census of 
the village taken in the month of August. They lose at least 
six weeks of school. They may lose even more before they are 
rounded up by the attendance department of their home city 
on their return after the canning season. 
1. As superintendent of schools, what is your responsibility 
toward this floating child population first with respect to cen- 
sus and second with respect to their attendance at school? 
2. What system of reciprocity should you establish with the 
neighboring metropolis to assure their attendance after leav- 
ing your community? 
CASE 4 
A boy, fourteen years old and in the sixth grade, has fur- 
nished to his poverty-stricken home the chief means of sup- 
port during the past few months since the death of the father. 
The attendance officer finds it difficult to compel the atten- 
dance of the boy when, by so doing, the widowed mother would 
have to apply to public-relief agencies for help. 
1. What is the solution of this problem consistent with the 
policy of compulsory education? 
2. What regulations should govern the conditions of the chil- 
dren who may wisely be employed? 
 
-P-A-G-E-446
  
  428 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
3. What conditions shall determine whether or not the state 
shall pay parents for keeping their children in school between 
the ages of 10 and 14? 
CASE 5 
Four boys of a wealthy family are registered in school as 
follows: high school senior, high school sophomore, eighth- 
grade pupil and fifth-grade pupil. The boys are popular and 
in part so because of the spending money which they utilize. 
The family has grown wealthy rapidly and the parents have 
been successful in moving into the best social circles. 
The senior boy started to school last fall three weeks after 
the beginning of the term. During duck-hunting season, he 
was out frequently and gave illness as the reason. He dances 
and frequently does not attend school during the forenoon of 
the next day, giving the same reason for his absence. When 
called on the ’phone, his mother verifies the boy’s story of ill- 
ness. She is skillful in evading direct responsibility for the 
absence. To gain favor for the boys, she has their instructors 
in her home for dinner, takes them driving in the family car 
and sees that they are invited to special affairs. Last spring, 
about one month before the end of the year, the father gave 
the senior boy a Nobby Six Roadster as a graduating present. 
This resulted in further absence for this boy as well as for his 
sophomore brother. 
The high school principal had frequently warned the father 
and mother that the senior’s graduation was in serious danger. 
Near the close of the year, the father attempted to employ the 
instructors of the boy to tutor him at their home in the eve- 
nings, offering to pay them for their services. The boy failed. 
The younger boys are following the example of their older 
brother. 
1. What plan should be followed toward influencing these 
parents to secure better attendance for their boys? 
2. What attitude should the school have adopted toward the 
senior boy’s frequent absence? 
CASE 6 
A farmer having a large family of eight children found it 
necessary to take his oldest daughter out of school at the age 
of eleven to do the housework because of an invalid wife. The
-P-A-G-E-447
CENSUS AND ATTENDANCE 429 
daughter, now fourteen years of age, was in the fifth grade 
when taken out and has been out of school three years. The 
father has been unable financially to employ a person to do 
the housework or care for the little ones. 
The school law specifically states that all children between 
the age of eight and seventeen must attend school. A special 
permit may be obtained for farm work for only six weeks dur- 
ing the year. 
1. Should this father be forced to obey the law under these 
circumstances? 
2. Could a satisfactory method be worked out under these 
conditions so that the child could do home work? 
3. What attitude should a superintendent take in a situa- 
tion of this kind? 
CASE 7 
On an average of ten times a year, about 25 per cent of the 
children in a public elementary school are absent from school 
from one period in the morning to a full day, the excuse being 
the observation of a church holiday. The custom has been to 
require these children to make up all absence by remaining 
after school for the period of absence. The interference with 
the school program is such that it would be much better to 
start school on these days two periods late and extend it cor- 
respondingly in the afternoon. 
1. Can the children absent from school for church holidays 
be considered illegally absent? 
2. Is it desirable to close school on days that a large number 
of children consider as church holidays? 
83. How should the absence of one or two periods be checked 
on the attendance record? 
CASE 8 
The annual school census is taken in Siskville just prior to 
the opening of school. From this enumeration, the names are 
transferred to a continuing census record, thus permitting a 
check against all names as to attendance in school. However, 
it is very frequently found toward the end of the school year 
that there are children in town who have been there practically 
all year and who have not been in school. Siskville has no 
check against them because they move in after the census is 
 
-P-A-G-E-448
  430 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
made. The state system provides for the transfer of census 
cards of one school system to another when the child moves, 
but this method of reciprocity has broken down. 
1. What measures can be used to discover whether school 
children are in a district after the census has been made? 
2. Should a small community of 3,000 people maintain a 
permanent continuing census? 
3. What plans can be utilized for securing better reciprocity? 
CASE 9 
In an agricultural community, many boys are retained at 
home to aid in the farm work, especially in the fall of the year 
when threshing is in progress. Later the potato season affords 
work for young boys who can earn considerable money work- 
ing behind the digger, and they sacrifice much opportunity in 
school. Pupils may get a permit from the State’s Attorney if 
the parents make affidavit that it is necessary for the support 
of the household and many times children are given vacation 
from school under the guise of home support. 
1. How far should a school administrator go in checking up 
cases where he feels reasonably certain that children are not 
legitimately absent? 
2. What measures should be used other than pointing out 
the value of each day’s attendance in school? 
3. What provisions in school should be made for children 
who have stayed out and are behind in school work for reasons 
given above? 
CASE 10 
The community is about evenly divided along sectarian 
lines. About one-half of the grade children attend the public 
schools; the others attend parochial schools. 
A smaller community within the same school unit has been 
built up around an industrial enterprise situated “around the 
head of the lake” and at a distance of a mile from the nearest 
public or parochial school buildings. The children in this 
smaller community would ordinarily attend the parochial 
schools. Because of the distance and inability to transport 
during the heavy winter season, a public school has been con- 
structed to serve these children. It is at a rather convenient 
distance from the most outlying homes.
-P-A-G-E-449
  
CENSUS AND ATTENDANCE 431 
Attendance has been poor. The attendance officer has met 
with little success and receives little or no recognition on the 
part of the parents. The rector, who ordinarily codperates 
splendidly in matters of school attendance, dismisses the case 
with the thought that “you can’t educate that sort of folks. 
All they will ever be able to do is some form of manual labor.” 
Conscious of the lack of pressure which might be exerted from 
this source, the parents willingly accept the diagnosis. The 
most effective means has been the efforts of one member of 
the Board who employs a number of these parents in the in- 
dustrial plant. He, too, is about convinced that they are 
hardly worth the effort. 
Because of the sectarian problem, it would be almost im- 
possible to secure a conviction in the community courts. 
Neither the attendance officer nor the Board feels that such 
action would be advisable. 
1. What may the superintendent do to impress the Board, 
the attendance officer, the rector, with the need of regular 
attendance? 
2. What pressure, other than court action, can be brought to 
bear? 
3. What may be done to make these non-English speaking 
parents understand the desirability of sending their children 
to school? (Very few of the parents speak English.) 
4. How may the school work be so arranged and conducted 
as to make the work so attractive to the boys and girls that 
they insist on coming to school? 
5. What may be done to induce stronger teachers to teach 
in this school in spite of the seemingly low caliber of pupils 
with which to work as well as the severe transportation prob- 
lem from the main community to this school during the long, 
severe winters? 
CASE 11 
A boy nine years old is frequently absent and always brings 
an excuse from his parents stating that he was sick. The at- 
tendance officer cannot force a sick child to attend. The school 
nurse does not have the right to diagnose. The family phy- 
sician cannot find a real cause for frequent illness. 
1. Should a petition be filed against the parents and the 
court be allowed to decide? 
 
-P-A-G-E-450
  432 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
2. Should the parents’ excuse be accepted as sufficient? 
3. What provision can be made where there is no regular 
school physician? 
CASE 12 
Jake Schorr, a German-Russian boy eleven years old, lives 
with his parents in the outskirts of Duke, N. K. His parents 
sign contracts each year with the American Sugar Beet Co. to 
care for and harvest ten acres of beets. 
About April 15, his parents signed an affidavit that he was 
needed to help support the family. They presented this to the 
attendance officer and on the following day Jake withdrew 
from school to work in the beet fields. He will not enter school 
again until about November 1, after the beets are harvested. 
1. What special arrangements could the schools of Duke 
provide to prevent this absence? 
2. Is our compulsory attendance law adequate when it per- 
mits a child to miss school to help support the family? 
3. Who is to blame for the injustice done this boy and for 
his absence from school? 
CASE 13 
A city of 100,000, with 22 elementary schools, 7 junior high 
schools, 1 senior high school, 1 continuation school and 7 
parochial schools, has a chief attendance officer and three as- 
sistants. The attendance department has great difficulty in 
getting codperation from parochial schools on attendance prob- 
lems. Children are often transferred to public schools and do 
not report for several weeks. Parochial schools fail to send in 
admission and transfer lists for the census. 
1. Is the attendance force adequate? 
2. What plans for codperation between parochial and public 
schools should be developed? 
3. What part should the state department play in the 
development of this codperation? 
CASE 14 
During an epidemic of scarlet fever, one teacher reported a 
pupil absent on Monday morning. Investigation showed that 
the pupil had broken out with scarlet fever Sunday morning. 
Tuesday morning, six absences were reported. The attendance
-P-A-G-E-451
  
CENSUS AND ATTENDANCE 433 
officer reported that these pupils’ parents refused to send their 
children to school for fear of getting the disease. He refused 
. to take action. The health board directed that the school be 
kept open. 
1. What are the first steps the superintendent should take? 
2. Were the parents justified in keeping the children out of 
school? 
8. Would the superintendent be justified in excusing absence 
under these conditions? 
CASE 15 
Mr. Brown has just succeeded Mr. Black, a fatherly, easy- 
going old gentleman, as superintendent of schools in Black- 
stone, a town of 7,500 population. During the last three years, 
the attendance law has not been well enforced. Many of the 
teachers have tried in vain to improve the situation, but have 
not been supported in their endeavors either by the superin- 
tendent or by the truant officer. Reports by teachers of re- 
peated unlawful absence to the superintendent or truant 
officer go unnoticed. Children come in late at will in some 
schools. Truancy is very common, and parents, most of whom 
are Italians, keep their children out whenever there is work 
to be done in the gardens or tending younger children. The 
parents’ interest in and knowledge of schools is very meager. 
On inquiring into the situation, Mr. Brown finds almost a 
hostile attitude on the part of parents to his demands that 
children come to school regularly. The truant officer, whose 
remuneration is $100 per year and who is also chief of police 
of Blackstone, is unwilling to follow up cases because of the 
time required. No system exists for the reporting of absences 
by teachers, except a letter to the superintendent or to the 
truant officer. There are no telephones in any of the ten 
buildings. 
1. What steps would you take to correct this condition in 
the Blackstone schools? 
2. What system of reports and what procedure would you 
set up for dealing with cases of illegal absences? 
3. What changes would you suggest, if any, in the attend- 
ance department?

PROBLEM 62 
EXCLUSION FROM SCHOOL 
Problem: The state superintendent receives a complaint from 
a citizen that the latter’s children are excluded from school 
because of alleged scarlet fever which he declares they did not 
have. He requests readmission at once. What is the superin- 
tendent to do in the matter? 
The children were excluded by the local board of education 
during a scarlet fever epidemic. If they had the disease, the 
board under the law was clearly right in excluding them and 
in refusing to admit them until the house had been properly 
fumigated. 
The father claims the children did not have scarlet fever, 
refuses to fumigate, and demands that the state superintend- 
ent order the board to readmit his children at once. 
The evidence in the case shows that the children were sick, 
that private physicians said they had scarlet fever, that the 
local health officials said the disease was not scarlet fever, and 
that the State Health Department representative said it was 
scarlet fever. 
Assignment 
1. Write the state superintendent’s decision in this matter 
with a brief justification of essential points, in form to be used 
as a precedent in succeeding similar cases. 
2. What difference, if any, would there be in the decision, if 
the State Department of Health had said the case was not 
scarlet fever, the private physicians and local health officials 
pronouncing as before?

PROBLEM 63 
HIGH SCHOOL ATTENDANCE 
Problem: In a comprehensive high school with 1,000 pupils, in 
a city of 30,000, the arrangements for keeping contact between 
the school and the home is very meager. The school has 
almost no contact with the attendance department, and the 
follow-up system for non-attendance set up by the school has 
proved inadequate. Although at the beginning of each 
semester in the neighborhood of 100 pupils, other than 
graduates, fail to return, little attempt has been made to in- 
vestigate such cases. Only those children that had elected to 
* come to high school from the grades but had failed to appear 
were reported to the attendance department. 
During the course of the semester the responsibility for fol- 
lowing up non-attendance has been left with the fifteen session 
room teachers. They have failed almost universally to make 
contact with all children that dropped out of school. There 
has been a common acceptance of the position that a child that 
was not doing well anyway might as well be out of school. 
The compulsory attendance law to a large degree has been 
ignored. There has been a very definite attitude against hay- 
ing the attendance department bring stragglers into classes a 
month or six weeks or eight weeks after the beginning of the 
semester. The net result is that the school is serving only 
those that came to it and chose to stay. Due to negligence or 
indifference there has been continued violation of at least the 
letter of the attendance law, and every year there are literally 
scores of children that disappear from the school (mostly be- 
tween semesters) without causing any action on the part of 
the school. 
There are indications that this failure to make contact with 
the homes of children leaving school is reacting unfavorably on 
the public attitude toward the school. 
436
-P-A-G-E-455
CENSUS AND ATTENDANCE 437 
THE PROPOSED SOLUTION 
The principal of the school proposed the following solution 
to the superintendent: 
He proposed (1) that he use his own teachers to make im- 
mediate contact with the homes by use of telephones at the 
end of the first half day session of absence; that letters be sent 
on that same day to the homes not reached by telephone, ask- 
ing parents to telephone to the school at once. (2) That the 
names of those not reached by the end of the first week be 
turned over to the attendance department. (3) That the at- 
tendance department enforce the attendance law on those 
within school age. (4) That the attendance department make 
contact with those beyond school age, as a common friend of 
the home and the school. (5) That similar follow-up work be 
done throughout the year by the attendance department on all 
cases that the teachers failed to reach and that this be done 
regardless of the age of the pupil. He proposed that some ar- 
rangements be made for caring for the occasional straggler in 
such a manner that he would not be a burden on teachers, and 
would consider his work in school profitable. 
Assignment 
1. What training would be necessary for attendance officers 
to fit them for the work of carrying out the spirit of this pro- 
posal throughout the entire attendance service? 
2. Should the attendance department be used in connection 
with the high school? 
3. Should the compulsory attendance part of the proposal 
be carried out, but the follow-up of children beyond the com- 
pulsory age be left to some other agency? If so, how care 
for it? 
4, Should the idea of having the attendance department 
represent the school be adopted for all cases, but the com- 
pulsory attendance law be neglected? 
5. What steps would you propose for improving the attitude 
of the teachers toward receiving children brought to school 
some time after the beginning of the semester? 
6. What provisions would you make for such cases? 
7. If you would propose another plan for obtaining this
-P-A-G-E-456

service, how would it be related to the attendance department? 
How would it compare in cost? What reaction would it have 
on grade school attendance service?

PROBLEM 64 
AGE-GRADE AND PROGRESS STUDIES 
Problem: The new superintendent of schools in Clifton has 
been in this position for four months. He has taken steps to 
gather data that will bear upon the policies of the schools 
governing such matters as progress, and age of entrance. At 
this time he has age and progress facts on all the children en- 
rolled in the schools. He wishes to formulate a statement of 
the educatignal status of the community as a basis for recom- 
mendations to the board of education before the next year’s 
budget is completed. What statements can be supported by 
the data he now has available? What recommendations 
should be made with regard to changes in policy? 
Clifton is a suburban town. In 1910 it had a population 
of 3,395; in 1920, the population was 5,709; and at the present 
time, 1925, it has a population of approximately 9,000. 
With a few exceptions, it is distinctly a residential com- 
munity. The majority of the residents are engaged in pro- 
fessional or commercial pursuits or employed in great indus- 
trial companies in the near-by city. 
The political government is administered by a mayor and 
council. The schools are governed by a Board of Education 
elected by the people and fiscally independent. The school 
organization consists of a supervising principal (superintend- 
ent); high school principal; two elementary school non-teach- 
ing principals; special teachers of drawing, music, physical 
training, domestic science, manual training; thirteen high 
school teachers; eight 7th and 8th grade teachers; one super- 
numerary teacher; four teacher-clerks; two special class 
teachers; one part-time medical inspector; two full-time 
nurses; one part-time dentist; one part-time attendance of- 
ficer; four janitors. 
The following table will show the growth of enrolment for 
the past eleven years.

  444 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
The new superintendent has been in Clifton for four months. 
He has collected information as to the training of teachers as 
given in Table 1, as to the scores of buildings (Table 2) and 
has done considerable toward an analysis of the age-grade and 
progress data available in the records. From this work he has 
available the data in Tables 3 to 12. Table 3 gives data on the 
‘relation of age to grade in one of the two elementary schools 
(School No. 1). Tables 4 and 5 give similar data for the 
junior and senior high school grades. Table 6 gives age- 
progress data for School No. 1 and for the junior and senior 
high school grades. Tables 9 and 10 summarize a study of 
age of entrance in School No. 1. Tables 11 and 12 show the 
“repeating” and “skipping” history of the pupils of School 
No. 1. 
None of these studies has been completed for the other 
elementary school. Delay was caused by the fact that many 
of the records in this school were incomplete. The record 
sheet from each teacher in this school had just arrived in the 
superintendent’s office. They are reproduced herein.

  460 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
Assignment 
1. Formulate the report of the superintendent tg the Board 
of Education. Include in this report a presentation to the 
board for their acceptance of any changes in policy that are in- 
dicated as desirable. 
2. In comparing the age-grade tables you have developed 
with those in other cities what adjustment did you find neces- 
sary to make them comparable? Are two age-grade tables 
comparable if one has ages computed as of September 1 while 
the other has ages computed as of March 1, the former with 
enrolment as of September, the latter as of May? If in the 
last question both enrolments were as of December what would 
be the answer? Are two age-grade tables comparable if one is 
based on a system with annual promotions, the other on a 
system with semi-annual promotions? Are two age-grade 
tables comparable if there is a difference of normal age spans? 
If six years of age in one means 6 years 0 months to 6 years 6 
months, while in the other it means 5 years 9 months to 6 
years 3 months? Can any of the above that are not com- 
parable be made so? 
3. What does the age-grade study in itself contribute to the 
determination of educational status? 
4, What do the age-progress data add to this? the grade- 
progress data? 
5. How often should each of these types of studies be made? 
6. Can you find any evidence that children coming from 
other places are either penalized or especially favored when 
they come into this system? 
7. Are there any findings from these data that would have 
particular publicity value? Are there any that should be 
taken up with the teachers before being reported to the Board 
of Education? Are there any that should go to the teachers 
alone? 
8. If you were faced by the situation described in this prob- 
lem, what additional data would you hope to have available 
before another year had passed?

PROBLEM 65 
CLASSIFICATION OF PUPILS 
Problem: What principles should guide the superintendent of 
the Weston schools in improving the classification of pupils? 
As a result of a program of testing, the superintendent of 
schools of Weston has concluded that decided changes are 
needed in the classification of pupils in his schools. Among 
schools he finds as much as a year’s difference in achievement 
on the same grade level. Within the same school he finds in 
some instances only slight differences between the averages in 
successive half grades. In some classes nearly all of the chil- 
dren are working on a level at least a half grade ahead of their 
classification. : 
Table 1 gives the results of tests in several schools. Table 
2 gives the distribution of results on the achievement tests. 
It shows the distribution of scores representing normal achieve- 
ment according to grade levels.

  CLASSIFICATION AND PROGRESS 465 
Assignment 
1. Some of the important factors to be kept in mind in the 
classification of children are: 
a. The individual—changes for his betterment 
b. The individual as one of a group of individuals—changes 
for mutual betterment 
c. The school and society—changes and mutual progress. 
Extend this list to include other criteria that tend to classify 
the individual in a specific school situation. 
2. How does the problem of transfer of children from school 
to school in a city affect your judgment as to the proper classi- 
fication in any case? 
3. In what ways might the criteria for classifying children 
of the Martin School fifth grade differ from those that apply 
to the classification of children in the Bond School fifth grade? 
4. Indicate the significance each of the following concepts 
bears toward the classification of pupils: Intelligence quo- 
tient, educational quotient, achievement ratio, mental age, 
chronological age, social age, physical age, educational age, 
subject age. 
5. Set up the principles that should govern the treatment 
of exceptionally bright boys and girls. 
6. What principles should govern the classification of the 
least able children that are not classed as “mentally retarded”? 
7. Analyze each of the six profiles and indicate what educa- 
tional treatment should be given each boy or girl. 
8. How may these pupils be kept in the same grade and the 
same room and yet be served according to their educational 
needs? 
9. In the case of a large school with five sections to a grade 
will it be possible to adjust to individual differences by homo- 
geneous grouping?

PROBLEM 66 
EDUCATIONAL ACCOUNTING 
Problem: What data must the superintendent of schools of 
Adrianople, N. K., have in order to be confident at any time as 
to the educational status of the schools? How can he meet 
the criticism from the Board to the effect that the high school 
is becoming overcrowded because of too low standards in the 
elementary schools? 
Adrianople had a population of 90,425 in 1920 as shown by 
the federal census and is rapidly growing as an industrial cen- 
ter. In a period of ten years we find that the school popula- 
tion has grown from 9,124 to 13,142. The high school has 
increased from 645 to 1,570, causing the inauguration of a 
double session plan. The number of high school graduates has 
increased from 76 to 158. 
As a result of the rising expenditures for the schools the 
Board of Education is anxious to know just what the true situ- 
ation is regarding the school progress. One member of the 
Board has been a superintendent of schools and has asked the 
present superintendent to present the necessary data to show 
actual conditions and the plans he would suggest for meeting 
the situation. There is an opinion on the part of many mem- 
| bers of the Board of Education that the high school has been 
overcrowded because children are being pushed through the 
grades too rapidly and that the present double session plan 
could have been avoided. 
Another phase of the school conditions that has caused con- 
siderable discussion in the city is the large part-time popula- 
tion which is lining up the local newspapers against the Board 
of Education because of their failure to make adequate pro- 
visions for a full day for every child in school. 
The attitude of the press has become so annoying to one 
member of the Board of Education that he offered a resolution, 
467 
 
-P-A-G-E-486
  468 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
later passed unanimously, that the superintendent of schools 
in his monthly report shall no longer call this group “part- 
time” classes, but shall tabulate them in his report as children 
on “legal school day” in view of the state law that children 
who attend school four hours have met the compulsory school 
law requirements. He has also called the Board’s attention to 
the fact that many authorities believe that four hours is a long 
enough school day for children in the first, second, and third 
grades. As only three classes of the fourth grade are on part- 
time he has expressed the belief that there is no reason for the 
Board to have undue anxiety about the existing conditions. 
It is with this attitude on the part of the Board of Education 
and the community thoroughly aroused to the necessity of in- 
creased educational facilities that the superintendent begins 
the collection of data to analyze the status of the schools. 
Tables 1 to 4 inclusive give data as to the number and loca- 
tion of part-time classes, the relationship of grammar and 
elementary schools, the years in school of grammar school 
graduates, and the size of classes.

Table 5 shows the results in the state examinations for 1920 
and 1921. Table 6 shows similar data for the years 1916 to 
1920. Although these examinations are not given with the 
idea that they should determine promotions, they are used for 
that purpose in many of the schools. In many schools they 
are given a weighting of one-third toward the final mark. As 
these results are given by schools it is possible for the superin- 
tendent to analyze them so as to discover the centers where 
poor results are being attained in this measure of the educa- 
tional achievement.

Table 9 summarizes an age-grade study of the elementary 
schools. Table 10 presents the results of a study of the causes 
of non-promotion in the grades. Similar studies were made 
for the high school. In the freshman class, the enrolment of 
which was 693, there were 344 subject failures, or 19.6 per cent. 
Of this number 148 were over age, 114 were normal age and 43 
under age. In the second year class, numbering 492, there 
were 256 subject failures, or 18 per cent. Of this number 64 
were over age, 51 were normal age, and 43 under age. In the 
third and fourth year classes the corresponding percentages of 
failure were 16 and 10. In the third year class 40 per cent of 
these were over age and 15 per cent under age. In the senior 
class 58 per cent of those who failed were over age and but 10 
per cent under age.

Assignment 
1. What additional data would you collect before presenting 
an analysis of the existing conditions? Are the criticisms of 
the schools justified? 
2. What curriculum adjustments could be made to meet 
variations in the racial composition of the schools? 
3. From the data given in what grade or grades is the in- 
cidence of retardation and elimination? 
4. What evidence is there of a violation of the compulsory 
education law? 
5. Is there any evidence of satisfactory acceleration? 
6. What other causes than those mentioned should be in- 
vestigated in the non-promotion records? 
7. Why should the number of non-promotions in January 
exceed those of June? This condition holds true over a num- 
ber of years. 
8. Of what value is Table 10 in localizing the attendance 
problem? 
9. In what way could you use the data herein contained to 
secure an appropriation for summer schools? 
10. What information can be given to the health depart- 
ment for investigation and suggested remedial measures? 
 
-P-A-G-E-494
  476 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
11. Is there any evidence that the course of study is better 
adapted to boys than girls? 
12. Rank the schools in the order of their educational ex- 
cellence. 
13. How shall the superintendent of schools show the 
school’s responsibility for the overage child? 
14. In what manner can he present the money cost of repe- 
tition versus the money saving of acceleration, if at all. 
15. Does the large population of foreign born explain— 
a. Increased high school registration? 
b. Failures in any grade subjects? 
c. Age-progress? 
d. Late entrance? 
e. Elimination? 
16. Will it be possible for the superintendent to use this ma- 
terial in a way that will not draw unjust criticism upon an 
individual school and yet show the probable effects of part- 
time conditions upon the progress and ability of the eighth 
grade classes? 
17. What studies of educational status should be made at 
regular intervals to provide a basis for progressive educational 
policies and to protect the schools in ease of attack?

PROBLEM 67 
CLASSES FOR RETARDED PUPILS 
Problem: The state law requires the organization of special 
classes for retarded pupils. How should these classes be or- 
ganized? What modifications in the curriculum and in meth- 
ods of teaching should be developed? 
The General Education Law of the state of N. K. (Sec. 578 
School Laws of 1917) provides that a Board of Education must 
determine by May 1918 the number “of children in attendance 
on the public schools who are three years, or more, retarded in 
mental development.” In the event that there are ten or more, 
special classes are to be organized not to exceed fifteen each to 
provide instruction “adapted to the mental attainments of 
such children.” Otherwise the Board may contract for their 
training. Additional sections provide for an assistant mental 
diagnostician in the State Department and for aid in the 
amount of one-half the teacher’s salary provided that the 
teacher is properly qualified. 
Owasko is a city of approximately 30,000 arranged more or 
less symmetrically about a public square. The distance from 
the square to the school district boundary lines ranges from 
114 miles to 2 miles. 
An investigation showed three so-called special rooms main- 
tained by the Owasko School Board. One of these rooms, a 
special coaching room not coming within the scope of the law, 
was located in the Clifton Street School in the west part of 
the city. One of the others was located in the Templeton 
Street School, less than one-half mile from the Public Square, 
and the other in the Washington Street School, little more 
than one-fourth mile from the Square but in the opposite di- 
rection. These two rooms, designed specifically for mentally 
retarded pupils and coming clearly within the scope of the 
statute making provision for such children, enrolled 13 and 17 
pupils respectively. The detailed statement furnished con-

cerning each pupil showed in no case anything but a low grade 
moron or feeble-minded child enrolled. 
The pupils for these rooms are found and assigned in the fol- 
lowing manner: The room teacher calls the attention of her 
principal to children who appear to be badly retarded for their 
ages. These are in turn referred to the head nurse of the 
school system. This nurse arranges for the examination of 
these children so recommended at a mental clinic conducted 
once a month for the entire county. Miss Chadsey, a mental 
diagnostician of the State Department of Education, and Dr. 
Fields, of the West End Institution, a psychiatrist, conduct the 
examinations that are held. These two people diagnose the 
cases referred to them and recommend the type of treatment 
to be accorded the individual children. They also test from 
time to time the children already enrolled in the special classes. 
The school system also conducts, through its physical train- 
ing and health departments, a physical examination of ele- 
mentary school children. 
The following table shows the number of elementary school

Inasmuch as these rooms had but 30 pupils out of a total 
elementary school enrolment of 4,587, or less than 1 per cent, 
the investigator raised the question whether these rooms served 
all the pupils who should be so served. Furthermore, it was 
frankly admitted that in some instances protests of parents 
were so strong that it was impossible to assign pupils in need 
of that type of training to those special rooms. 
Both teachers had taken the special course for such teachers 
offered by the Union Training School. The equipment ap- 
peared to be that ordinarily used in such rooms. The writer 
was not altogether clear as to whether these rooms were 
located so as to serve adequately the school enrolment. 
It appeared that the head nurse was largely responsible for 
the administration of the classification of pupils in these 
rooms. She was also responsible for submitting the course of 
study followed by the teachers of these rooms to the State 
Department for approval. 
Assignment 
1. Prepare a brief on the curriculum and courses of study 
which should be developed for these classes. 
2. Is the method of locating children in need of this type of 
training adequate? If not, what machinery should be set up 
to make it possible to locate all children who should be assigned 
to such rooms? 
3. Are these rooms properly located for serving all the ele- 
mentary school enrolment assuming that two such centers 
will prove adequate?

REDUCING RETARDATION

Sparksburg take in order to reduce retardation to a minimum? 
least one half grade before reaching the fifth grade. The i i | 
Fifty-five per cent of the children in Sparksburg repeat at / 
superintendent has set out to reduce this retardation. Since / 
the abandonment of city-wide examinations several years ago / 
each school had been a law unto itself in respect to this im-/ 
portant problem. In most schools there was little or no super-/ 
vision by the principal with respect to promotions. A recent \ 
study of age-grade and progress conditions showed that there 
was great variation from school to school and within each 
school, as to the percentages of children failed. A few schools 
had introduced the plan of homogeneous grouping, but this 
had failed to reduce the percentages of failures. Special classes 
for the mentally retarded had been set up, but the number of 
children cared for in this fashion was so small that the effect 
on the percentage of failure was negligible. There had been 
some experimentation with special groups in the high school, 
but this had not affected the great variations in the failing 
practices of individual teachers outside of one or two depart- 
ments. 
Tn addition to the data on the age-grade and progress situa- 
and on promotions there are available reports on the ex- 
periments carried on in the high school and statements given 
by teachers in a general teachers’ meeting of the conditions 
that in their opinion should govern the failing of pupils in 
particular grades and subjects. 
On the following pages are given the reports of the experi- 
ments conducted in the high school, and some of the state- 
ments made by the teachers.

REPORTS OF EXPERIMENTATION IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
Special Classes for the Least Capable Repeaters in Second Semester 
Algebra and for the More Capable Repeaters in First Semester 
Algebra 
The original problem attempted in special classes in second 
semester algebra was that of dealing with students who failed in 
second semester algebra, because they had failed to master the 
first semester work in algebra. This has grown into a rather exten- 
sive study of border-line cases. At the end of the semester ending 
January 1923 and each succeeding semester teachers have been 
asked to report those students whom they graded as failing for this 
reason. These students have then been placed in special classes as 
nearly as possible. It was hoped by isolating such individuals to be 
able to review the first semester of the subject and then go on and 
complete the second semester in a satisfactory manner. 
Tables 1 and 2 give the data for two such classes in second semester 
algebra. Since a number of students failed to be placed in those

to compare the results from those students who were treated by
-P-A-G-E-501
  
CLASSIFICATION AND PROGRESS 483 
special class methods with those from the same type of students in 
regular classes. 
A comparison of the results of those students in regular classes 
with those in special classes for these two semesters give results 
markedly against the special classes. The differences are so great 
in both semesters that this conclusion is safe in spite of the fact 
that it necessitates an assumption that the special classes are on 
the average of the same ability as those that failed to be placed in 
special classes. 
Bearing of Special Class Results on Demotions and Mid-semester 
Failures in Second Semester Algebra 
This result may be considered as bearing not only upon the 
problem attempted, but also on the general attitude towards the 
failing students in beginning algebra. It is quite evident that 
strictly border-line cases can recover in their second semester of 
algebra in spite of the first semester’s work. Viewed with this idea 
in mind, it is not difficult to see why this may not easily prove 
true since there are really very few processes in the first semester 
of algebra which can not be mastered in a very short time. The 
student has already got a more or less hazy notion of these 
processes. Through the pressure of the second semester work he 
has evidently mastered most of these that are basic, while on the 
other hand his one semester in second semester algebra has given 
him a sort of outline basis for his work during his repeating semester 
in which he needs but to complete the mastery of the processes that 
were partly mastered the failing semester. It would seem then that 
he has a distinct advantage over the student with the same prob- 
lem in the first semester algebra who has spent the extra semester 
in training on comparatively simple processes, and then goes into the 
second semester algebra with no idea of the comparatively vast field 
which he must cover. It might be administratively advantageous 
to pass even a much lower group of people from first semester 
algebra with the idea in mind of giving two semesters of second 
semester algebra, if necessary. (See report on page 484.) 
As to the special class device of meeting this situation, we may 
say that in second semester algebra it has not been successful. 
Looking forward to the failure of this device, steps have been taken 
to make demotions in the middle of the second semester algebra 
so that the students who are failing in second semester algebra be- 
cause of failure to master first semester work could have the remain- 
ing part of this semester for getting a background of the work of 
the first semester. Such demotions were made at the middle of the 
semester ending June 1924, anticipating the abandonment of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-502
    484 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
special classes the next semester. However, should the conclusion 
given above be further borne out by additional data we would be 
justified in concluding that it would be more helpful for the student 
to continue his work in the second semester algebra than to be 
demoted, and that this new device would also be advisable. 
Further, if our explanation of the phenomenon as given in the 
preceding paragraph is tenable, the practice of making silent mem- 
bers in second semester algebra should not be followed. We may 
not expect this condition to hold so well where there is more 
sequence in the subject matter as in second semester geometry. 
Bearing of Special Class Results on Earlier Investigation of 
Border-line Cases 
Bearing on this same question of dealing with border-line cases 
it is interesting to recall that the two classes of beginning algebra 
repeaters that were formed the first semester of 1922-23, were 
divided into a better and poorer group. It was the purpose of this 
class to determine whether or not some students repeating first 
semester algebra might not be able to review first semester algebra 
and then take second semester algebra in the same semester. It did 
not take long to discover that this was impossible. It is now evident 
that the wrong method was used with this group. It would have 
been far more promising to start this class in second semester 
algebra immediately, reviewing only where the beginning algebra 
processes were actually needed. There might have been a different 
result if we had used this method. 
A Suggested Treatment of Sub-passing Students in First Semester 
Algebra—Hurdle Classes 
One could hardly advise, however, that such students be grouped 
together. It would seem to be far more advisable to place them in 
the regular second semester classes and then give them an extra 
period at the end of their program in a class, the purpose of which 
would be to take up those processes in beginning algebra, that were 
being used in the work of the second semester algebra; that is, the 
first subject that would be attacked by such groups would be 
factoring. The possibility of assignment to such a group would 
serve as an incentive for the student to do what is ordinarily classed 
as satisfactory work in beginning algebra. The cost element 
could be cut down to less than the normal cost, by elimination of 
these special groups at the end of a couple of months, by which 
time it is probable that all necessary processes could have been 
mastered. If there are grounds for the expectations of successes 
for such people after two semesters of second semester algebra, the
-P-A-G-E-503
  
CLASSIFICATION AND PROGRESS 485 
cost element would thus be materially reduced and the student held 
up to work more worthy of his mettle, throughout his course in 
first year algebra. 
At the present time we are dealing in this manner in an experi- 
mental way with failing students in beginning algebra who have 
not been recommended for the special class for failures or whose 
failure is not due largely to absence. To obtain the first experi- 
mental group the better half of all failing students in beginning 
algebra in June 1924 were chosen. Only 19 of these eventually 
reached the class. These 19 were assigned to second semester 
classes as they would have been had they passed. Then they were 
all assigned to the same first semester class. Also, they were re- 
moved from some other subject. The experimental class was then 
handled as suggested above. Of the 19 students three were trans- 
ferred back to regular beginning algebra, two withdrew from school 
and one was failed. Of the thirteen given credit in the first semester 
algebra, all but two (both had been absent considerably) made 
passing marks in the regular second semester classes; half of these 
made B’s or A’s. 
This group so exceeded the expectations that it was determined 
to go one step further. For the current semester all failing students 
who were not recommended for the special class for hopeless failure 
or who had not been absent a great deal of the time were included. 
This class started with 43. This time, however, they were not re- 
moved from any other subject. Also, they were not given assign- 
ments to prepare. Algebra hurdles were used in class." As soon 
as a student reached certain standards he was released from the 
special class. In every respect the data on these classes fortify 
the deductions drawn from the special classes in second semester 
algebra. They need to be carefully reckoned with both in the class- 
room procedure and in the shaping of administrative policy. 
Special Classes for Failures in Second Semester Geometry 
Data are available for two special classes in second semester 
geometry made up of students reported as failing because of lack 
of mastery of the work of the first semester. The available data 
are given in Tables 3 and 4, comparing those in special classes 
to those in regular classes. From an inspection of these tables it 
may be readily seen that the special class device in second semester 
geometry is much more valuable than in second semester algebra. 
Although the tendency seems to be toward better results from the 
special classes, it is not marked enough and the cases considered 
“3 Dalman, M. A. In Journal of Educational Research, Vol. I. 
 
-P-A-G-E-504
486 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
not great enough in number to be conclusive. It has been decided, 
therefore, to continue the use of this device until sufficient data 
have accumulated to serve as a basis for judgment.

Whether the alternative device suggested for second semester 
algebra would be more valuable than the special class device is a 
matter worthy of investigation, since it is quite evident that failure 
to understand beginning geometry is a greater detriment to success- 
ful second semester work in geometry than is the parallel case with 
algebra. 
JUDGMENT OF TEACHERS AS TO WHAT SHOULD CON- 
STITUTE REASONS FOR REPEATING 
1. Grade 2A 
In this grade, spelling, arithmetic and writing are begun. If a 
child is immature but has advanced in reading so that he was put 
in the second grade, he may not be able to understand arithmetic 
and he may not have grasped the number symbols or number sense.
-P-A-G-E-505
  CLASSIFICATION AND PROGRESS 487 
He may also lack proper codrdination of muscles and thus be unable 
to carry third grade work. 
If a child is too old for the grade, but no provision is made for 
special classes and he does not have a fairly good mastery of the 
subject, it would be justifiable to keep him and give him extra 
time. 
2. Grade 3B and 8A 
1. Failure to acquire habits of attention and concentration in the 
first two grades. 
2. Absence because of ill health. 
3. Not overage. 
4. Underweight and nervous. 
5. Lacks in physical codrdination. 
3. Grade 3 
1. Failure to master technique of: 
a. Reading. 
b. Arithmetic, as tables with multiplication, division, etc. 
c. Spelling. 
2. Failure to grasp the spirit of work which should be done. 
Child should not be asked to repeat because of: 
a. Lack of discipline. 
b. Absence for reasonable time. 
c. Under conditions where the child would benefit less by re- 
maining, due to discouragement, etc., than he would by 
regular promotion. J 
4. Grade 5 
1. Repeat when very inferior in mental age as determined by 
intelligence tests. 
2. Not fitting the grade socially. 
8. Not physically able to take on the added strain of the next 
year’s work. 
4. Very poor meeting of the achievements required by the grade 
standards has been made. 
' 5. Grade 6 
General inability to grasp the essentials of the major subjects 
of the sixth grade—arithmetic, geography, English, possibly be- 
cause of— 
1. Coming into grade unprepared from previous grade and find- 
ing the work uphill all along the line—possibly been pushed 
beyond capacity, or—
-P-A-G-E-506
488 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
2. Continued absence causing lack of continuity in the work, or— 
8. Lack of application on part of pupil—work not done day by 
day, or— 
4, Pupil too young—unable to grasp the logical thought which 
is developed in this grade in connection with these subjects, 
or— 
5. A pupil simply promoted because overage, if no other place 
to put him. 
6. Grade 7—Arithmetic 
A complete or very considerable lack in the understanding of 
the underlying principles of the business arithmetic which is now 
included for that grade, according to the recommendations of the 
“Committee on the Reorganization of Mathematics.” 
7. 9B—Algebra 
1. Objective test given to all the pupils in that subject show the 
child has not such a mastery as will allow him to proceed into 
second semester algebra even though put in a low I.Q. group. 
2. The tests show, when compared to I.Q., that child has not 
made reasonable achievement. 
8. 9th Grade—Home Economics 
1. Pupil who does not show grasp of main principles taken up 
during semester, and needs them. 
2. Pupil who is not able to apply the principles above mentioned 
and who, therefore, cannot do the more difficult processes, 
for instance, in clothing construction. 
3. Only such pupils who can benefit by a repetition of the work 
and show in other ways that they are able to benefit by the 
repetition. For example, pupils who in mental tests show 
sufficient ability. 
9. Commercial Algebra 
Repeat only if child has done absolutely nothing during the 
course. It is not necessary to keep a child back because he has 
failed in an examination. 
10. Hygiene in High School 
A child should not be required to repeat a semester of the course 
unless he did not get the fundamental attitude the first time. He 
would get this by acquiring certain subject matter and getting 
habits of study, perhaps; but chiefly by realizing the value of estab- 
lishing desirable health habits. Perhaps he should be given an ex- 
   
-P-A-G-E-507
     CLASSIFICATION AND PROGRESS 489 
amination to see if he had this fundamental attitude toward the 
subject, but the teacher should be able to tell a great deal from his 
observation of the student. 
Assignment 
1. What are the next steps the superintendent of schools 
should take toward reducing retardation? 
2. The statements made by teachers indicate how well they 
understand the problems involved. What bearing does this 
have upon the problem faced by the superintendent? 
3. What conclusion can you draw from the results of the 
experiments worked out in the high school? 
4. Propose general regulations for governing retardation. 
5. What assistance do these regulations give the kinder- 
garten teacher? the 1B teacher? the 6A teacher? the teacher 
of 9B algebra? the teacher of 9A algebra? the teacher of gen- 
eral science? the teacher of community civics? the teacher of 
American history? the teacher of commercial arithmetic? the 
teacher of solid geometry? 
6. What cases commonly considered failure cannot be cared 
for adequately by your regulations? 
7. What administrative devices are available as substitutes 
for repeating a grade or subject? 
8. In the light of the above, what are the next steps that 
should be taken by the superintendent of schools? What part 
will the board of education, the principals, the teachers and 
the supervisors have in your plan for reducing retardation to 
a minimum?

PROBLEM 69 
CLASSIFICATION OF PUPILS 
Problem: What results may we expect to secure from the 
homogeneous grouping of pupils? 
After five semesters’ experience with the homogeneous 
grouping of students in the first four semesters of high school 
mathematics in a cosmopolitan high school, the research bu- 
reau has assembled considerable data for testing the results 
obtained. These data are given in the fifteen tables repro- 
duced here. The methods used in differentiating students are 
indicated in the table headings. Except for the first semester 
of experimentation (in second semester algebra), the groups 
were obtained by shifting students reciting in the same hour 
in different sections of the same subject. This left undiffer- 
entiated those children reciting in hours when there was but 
one section. These undifferentiated classes provided the check 
groups indicated here as heterogeneous sections. Teachers 
were commonly given good as well as poor student groups. 
To balance the advantages to the teacher, the better sections 
were made larger, the normal sections were made average, and 
the poor sections small. For instance, if three sections were 
to be made of 90 students, they would be divided into groups 
of 35, 30, 25. 
The combination of tests and marks used was the best pos- 
sible combination of the particular measures used. In general, 
they gave as good an estimate on what the child would do dur- 
ing the semester as teachers can give six weeks after the be- 
ginning of the term. Due to the ease of shifting students from 
one’section to another, teachers were encouraged to change a 
child whenever it would seem to be to the child’s advantage. 
Teachers were supervised to see that they made such shiftings. 
The misplacement of a child could be corrected without any 
red tape whatsoever, the moment it was discovered.

CLASSIFICATION AND PROGRESS 491 
With but two or three exceptions, all 25 of the teachers in 
the department favored the plan as making work easier for 
them. Of the two or three that did not positively favor it, 
none claimed that the method was more difficult. Teachers 
were asked to keep on the lookout for undesirable effects on 
children and none were reported when they were asked to fill 
out an extensive questionnaire. 
There were no difficulties with parents. 
The course of study followed was the traditional one. The 
first two years were made up of first and second semester alge- 
bra and first and second semester geometry.

grouping.

1The term two-section, three-section, etc., refers to the number of types of classes formed, 
that is, the four four-section classes were four classes reciting at the same hour with the 
best students grouped in one class, and the next best in another class, the poor in another 
class and the poorest in another class. 
2 The three-section homogeneous groups here are not comparable to those in the preceding 
and succeeding semesters, since in this semester but two types of classes were made; i.e., one good class and two poorer classes of approximately equal ability. 8 Ratios of failure expressed as percentages of the mean of June 1919 and January 1920 ratios. 
Administrative differences make earlier data not comparable. 
4Set A and Set B are not comparable. Recitation period varies.

Differences not particularly significant. ‘The minimum test had for its purpose the testing of the mastery of fundamentals, Theoreti- cally, less attention being taken for the misfit, homogeneous classes should give more drill on sub- jects most needed by the group. This, it was believed, could be tested by a series of questions of puch brevity that quicker reaction brought about by more drill would tell on the number of ques- tions answered. The maximum test had for its purpose the testing of elements outside the minimum requirements of the course. Theoretically, the good student would have more opportunity to go beyond the minimum essentials if placed in a homogeneous class.

Assignment 
1. What statement can you make with regard to homogene- 
ous grouping after analyzing these data? 
2. Can you support your conclusions with the other findings 
in this field? Do they have any specific bearing on the prob- 
lem of classification in general? If so, what? 
3. What advantages claimed for homogeneous grouping can- 
not be established from these data? 
4. How would you improve the technique of measuring the 
results? 
5. On what basis would you recommend differentiation of 
children in the fifth grade? What results would you expect to 
obtain? 
6. What other types of homogeneous groupings might be 
set up in the first two semesters of high school algebra? (Or 
any other specific subject covering the two semesters of the 
freshman year—or, if you prefer, in any elementary grade?)

PROBLEM 70 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ORGANIZATION 
Problem: As a beginning in the reorganization of the educa- 
tional program in the schools of Millerstown, N. K., a city of 
90,000 population, the superintendent of schools has chosen 
three elementary schools for intensive study. Each of these 
schools represents a distinct educational problem. One of 
them is located in the best residence district and therefore 
serves children with unusual home advantages; another is in 
the foreign district of the city and serves children from homes 
in which English is not spoken. The third school is on the 
border of the foreign district and draws from foreign and 
American homes approximately equally. None of these schools 
has fewer than 1,000 pupils. The 6A grade is the highest 
grade. There is no kindergarten, but the schools that have 
foreign children give a year of pre-first grade work, the pur- 
pose of which is to teach English vocabulary. 
The following data have been collected for each of these 
schools: 
Map of the city showing location of schools 
Strayer-Engelhardt scores for buildings 
Floor plans 
Pictures of all children in class groups—with names 
Training and experience of teachers 
Age of each child 
Progress history of each child 
Height and weight of each child 
Disposition made of each child at the end of the semester 
June 1925 
Reasons for all variations from normal promotion in June 
1925 
Health facts on each child—whether he is ill often, whether 
he appears undernourished, whether he has poor teeth, de- 
fective vision or difficulties in speech.

Notes as to whether a child lacks in play activity, and 
whether he is among the best or poorest workers in his 
class. ; 
Attendance data 
Course of study 
Time allotments to subjects in present programs 
Position of the children in these schools relative to that of 
the children in all other schools in the city as indicated 
by the McCall Multi-Mental Test, the Woody-McCall 
Mixed Fundamentals in Arithmetic, and the Thorndike- 
McCall Reading Scale given in May 1925. 
The following test data are available for each child: 
Intelligence Tests 
McCall Multi-Mental for Grades 3B to 6A 
National for Grades 4A and 6A 
Pintner-Cunningham for Grades 1B to 2A 
Achievement Tests 
Stanford Achievement Test for Grades 4B to 6A 
Thorndike-McCall Understanding of Sentences for Grades 
8B and 3A 
Thorndike Word Knowledge for Grades 3B to 3A 
There are also notes from the teachers giving reasons why 
certain children may be expected to do poorly on the tests. 
The tests are all graded and charts showing the relative 
standing of the schools in grades 4A and 6A have been made. 
All of the data are filed in the office of the Director of Re- 
search. Age-grade and grade-progress tables have been made. 
This city has a supervising principal in each school. The 
other supervisory officers consist of the superintendent, the di- 
rector of research, the director of junior and senior high 
schools, the director of elementary schools, the director of con- 
tinuation schools, a supervisor of music and a supervisor of 
art. 
Assignment 
How would you go about the task of developing in these 
three schools the type of educational programs that could 
serve as a nucleus for the best possible educational program 
for the entire city? Outline your plan in detail, including per- 
sonnel used, and the specific uses to be made of the data.

PROBLEM 71 
THE REORGANIZATION OF A SMALL CITY 
SCHOOL SYSTEM 
Problem: The city of Sanford is under the necessity of in- 
creasing its school accommodations. It has been organized in 
a somewhat irregular manner due to the buildings which have 
been available. The school system began with a single build- 
ing near the center of the community. As the city grew an- 
other structure was built across the railroad track, dividing 
the city. Still further development demanded new accommo- 
dations and a relatively large building was built near the orig- 
inal central building and an eight-room building was con- 
structed on the opposite side of the tracks. The latest develop- 
ment, prior to the present overcrowding, took the form of 
building a modern elementary school building on the site of 
the second building constructed in the city. Some of the data. 
which are essential to the consideration of the problem are 
presented below:

These children are housed, as has been explained above, in 
four buildings. Building No. 1 takes care of classes from the 
kindergarten through the sixth grade. All of the lower grade 
children from that side of the railroad track are now attending 
school in building No. 1. The enrolment is 451. Building No. 
2 accommodates the first and second grade and one class for 
mentally backward. It is organized as a part of the new ele- 
mentary school above referred to. Building No. 3 enrols chil- 
dren from kindergarten through the fourth grade and has at 
present 312 children enrolled. Building No. 4 (the new ele- 
mentary school building) cares for children from kindergarten 
through the eighth grade and enrols 559 pupils. Building No. 
5 enrols children from the seventh to the twelfth grades, in- 
clusive, and has at present 426 pupils in attendance. This

  506 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
building is not a high school building, but has been adapted 
for high school purposes. It has one woodworking shop, and 
one combination cooking and sewing room. The laboratory 
facilities are inadequate. The combined auditorium-gym- 
nasium is on the top floor of a four-story building. The site 
is less than an acre. 
It is important in considering the reorganization program 
to know that building No. 1 is old and in many respects un- 
suited for school purposes. The day lighting is most inade- 
quate, the ratio of window area to floor area falling in some 
cases as low as ten per cent. 
The population is distributed over an area of approximately 
five square miles. The children attending both elementary 
and high schools are very evenly divided by the railroad which 
cuts through almost exactly through the center of the city. 
The overcrowding which will increase rapidly is about equally 
evident in both parts of the city. 
Assignment 
1. Assuming that there is sufficient wealth available to pro- 
vide adequate school accommodations without an unduly 
heavy tax rate being imposed upon the people, and assuming 
further that adequate sites can be had, well located with re- 
spect to the possible extension of all of the sites now held 
except building No. 1 and the building used as a high school, 
what plan of reorganization for the school system would you 
propose? 
2. It has been suggested that a high school be built on one 
side of the railroad and a junior high school on the other side 
of the railroad. What do you think of the wisdom of this 
proposal? 
8. It has also been suggested that the present high school 
plant be converted into a junior high school and that a new 
high school be erected. Would this be the best disposition to 
make of this situation? 
4. The board of education offices are now located in a busi- 
ness building within two blocks of building No. 1. The board 
is paying a rental of $75 a month for its offices. Do you think 
this fact ought to enter into your consideration in determining
-P-A-G-E-525
  LOCAL SCHOOL SYSTEMS 507 
the utilization of plant and the type of organization which you 
would seek to develop? 
5. Building No. 1 and the structure now housing the seventh 
and eighth grades and the high school are within one block of 
each other. In proposing the reorganization indicate in detail 
the number of classes of each grade that you would expect to 
house in each of the several school buildings; the type of 
special equipment which you would provide in any new build- 
ings to be erected; the considerations of economy that it would 
be necessary to keep in mind; your expectations with respect 
to any increase in efficiency due to reclassification of children.

PROBLEM 72 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ORGANIZATION 
Problem: What improvements can be made over the pro- 
gressive organization already established in the Emerson 
School? 
The Emerson School, a school with 2,400 pupils in grades 1 
to 6 and the kindergarten, varies from the traditional organiza- 
tion in the following ways: 
1. All children retarded two or more years are placed in 
special classes with a modified curriculum consisting of read- 
ing, arithmetic, and industrial arts. Since there are four such 
classes they are divided into three groups according to age and 
school development. The upper classes are divided as to sex. 
2. Remaining classes are grouped homogeneously according 
to ability. If there are five sections to a half grade, one group 
is left heterogeneous as a receiving class. Children coming 
into the school during the semester are put in this group and 
classified at the beginning of the next semester. 
3. The lowest group is given a modified curriculum, ad- 
justed to their needs. 
4, The upper groups are given additional subjects: French, 
music appreciation, freehand drawing, and extra time in an 
excellent library. 
5. In the lower grades these abler children are taught their 
regular work by the classroom teacher and then given the extra 
work on a departmentalized basis. 
6. In grades 5 and 6 there are six of the advanced sections 
(240) children that have their work in arithmetic, English, 
geography and history both departmentalized and individual- 
ized. Two rooms are set aside for English, two for arithmetic 
and one each for geography and history. A half day is given 
to this work. In the afternoon group-work departmentalized 
is carried on in drawing, physical training, music appreciation 
and dramatic arts; the girls have cooking and the boys con- 
508
-P-A-G-E-527
LOCAL SCHOOL SYSTEMS 509 
struction work also. They have access to an excellent library. 
Tn the individual work all children have the same number of 
assignments or contracts, but when the semester’s work is com- 
pleted before the end of the semester, additional work is given 
in the above subjects and additional free time given in the 
school library. Out of each 20 days’ work the child has 16 
work periods, three recitations and one test period. 
Assignment 
1. Compare the above organization as to adjustment to the 
needs of children with: 
a. The platoon school c. The Winnetka Plan 
b. The Dalton Plan d. The Cambridge Plan 
2. What changes would you recommend that would bring 
the school into closer adjustment to the needs of the children? 
8. A test of the achievement of the individual classes in- 
dicated a wider spread in achievement in these classes than in 
traditional classes. Does it have any bearing on question 1? 
4. A school of 1,200 pupils with annual promotions could 
have as good opportunities for classification as this school. 
Would a city with schools of 800 to 1,600 pupils be justified in 
abandoning semi-annual promotions for annual promotions? 
5. To what extent do you consider departmentalization of 
instruction permissible in each grade (1 to 12 inclusive)? In 
making your judgment consider the need—if any—for oppor- 
tunities for the project method and the socialized recitation. 
Consider also the possibilities of making practical substitutes 
for any loss incurred in having a number of teachers for each 
child rather than one only, losses possibly in educational and 
vocational guidance for instance. 
6. To what extent do you consider individualization of in- 
struction permissible in each of the grades? Consider here 
also the need—if any—for opportunities for the project 
method and the socialized recitation.

PROBLEM 73 
THE ORGANIZATION OF SCHOOLS 
Problem: To establish principles for the development of the 
educational organization in a small community. 
Lafayette Township is a residence and rural community, 
many of the inhabitants of which are engaged in agricultural 
pursuits. Because of the electric railroad transportation facili- 
ties, the township has become in part a suburban residential 
community for the adjoining large city. 
The population of the township has increased from 1,500 in 
1890 to 3,700 in 1920, the most rapid increase occurring during 
the decade 1900-1910. 
One thousand of the population live on farms, the median 
farm being 24 acres in size. Two thousand seven hundred live 
in small communities. 
There are five school buildings in the township, with enrol- 
ments as follows: 325 children; 185 children; 180 children; 
25 children and 20 children, or a total of 740. 
The Composition of Population 
The most recently made State Census shows that 80 per cent 
of the population of Lafayette Township is American born, 
the remainder being made up of English, Germans, Italians 
and Irish. According to the same census report, the census was 
divided into the following occupational groups: professional, 
66; commercial pursuits, 79; skilled laborers, 371; unskilled, 
413; farmers, 146, and all other occupations, 185. 
The Organization of Schools 
The schools of Lafayette Township are administered by a 
board of nine members, three of whom are chosen at each an- 
nual school meeting. Each member holds office for a term of 
three years. The clerical duties of the board are performed by 
a paid district clerk. The board has three standing committees 
510   
      
 
-P-A-G-E-529
  
LOCAL SCHOOL SYSTEMS 511 
which are appointed annually by the board. These commit- 
tees are—The Teachers; Buildings and Grounds; and Finance. 
The number of times that matters have been referred to and 
reported from these standing committees during the years 
1923-1924 is shown in Table 1.

The reports from the Committee on Finance are approxi- 
mately 50 per cent of the total number of reports made during 
this period. 
The members of the Board of Education have been very 
faithful in their attendance at board meetings, the average 
attendance for a ten-year period being 6.9 members, as shown 
in Table 2.

Types of Business Transacted by the Board 
In Table 3 will be found a summary of the work of the board 
during fourteen recent consecutive meetings. The types of 
 
-P-A-G-E-530
    512 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
business transacted have been divided into routine matters and 
those involving discussion of the formation or adoption of a 
school policy. Ninety-three per cent of the business transacted 
has been of a routine nature, apparently, in most cases, of the 
kind which should be left in the hands of a chief administrative 
officer. On the fourteen items involving educational policy, 
ten were proposed on the initiative of the board, one on the 
initiative of the supervising principal, two on the initiative of 
the county superintendent, and one on the initiative of the 
taxpayer.

Community Interest in Board Elections 
The average number of votes cast for the ten-year period at 
the election of school board members was 37. The average 
number cast at meetings where an annual budget was proposed 
was 38. The average number of votes cast when resolutions 
involving building projects were presented to the people for 
consideration was 66. At no district meeting, with the excep- 
tion of a special district meeting held in May, 1915, has any 
large number of voters appeared for the purpose of casting
-P-A-G-E-531

votes, thereby showing their interest in school matters. Table 
4 gives the distribution of votes cast for all public meetings 
since March, 1914. The total population of Lafayette Town- 
ship for 1920 has been shown to be 3,700.

The Office of the District Clerk 
The district clerk is the paid secretary of the Board of Ed- 
ucation. He may be elected from among the members of the 
Board, or may be from outside the Board. The clerk’s duties, 
as specified by law, are as follows:— 
He shall record in a suitable book all proceedings of the Board 
of Education, of the annual school meetings and of special school 
meetings. He shall pay out by orders on the custodian of the school 
moneys of the school district, and in the manner prescribed by all, 
all school moneys of the district. He shall keep a correct and 
detailed account of all the expenditures of school moneys in the 
district, and shall report to the Board at each regular meeting the 
amount for which warrants shall have been drawn since the date

514 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
of his last report, the accounts against which said warrants shall 
have been drawn, and the balance to the credit of each account. 
At each annual school meeting, he shall present his: record books 
and his accounts for public inspection, and shall make a statement 
of the financial condition of the district. He shall post notices of 
the annual and special meetings of the legal voters—and during 
the month of July in each year he shall present to the Board of 
Education a detailed report of the financial transactions of the 
Board during the preceding school year; and file a copy thereof 
with the County Superintendent of Schools . Incase any 
money shall be ordered to be raised by special tax, the district clerk 
shall make out and sign a certificate thereof, ——————,, that the 
same is correct ——, and deliver the same to the Board of 
Taxation of the county ——, and shall send a duplicate to 
the County Superintendent of Schools. For this service, the Board 
pays $500 a year. 
The Educational Officers 
There are three administrative officers appointed by the 
Board, a supervising principal, a medical inspector, and a 
truant officer, who are responsible to the Board and codérdinate 
in authority. The present supervising principal has authority 
primarily in the field of supervision of the twenty teachers on 
the staff. According to the minutes of the Board of Education, 
it is the custom of the supervising principal to make monthly 
reports to the Board. The following matters were reported by 
him in the last ten months—enrolment, average daily attend- 
ance, examination grades, overcrowded rooms and minor 
details.     
  
  
Medical Inspection and Enforcement of Attendance 
The Board employs a physician for the purpose of making 
medical inspections. The work has not been extended beyond 
that point. The truant officer works at the direction of the 
Board of Education. There is no nurse. Aggregate days of 
attendance is one source of state income but there is no per- 
manent school census nor any other adequate system of records 
and reports.

9. Is the school board warranted in engaging a full-time 
medical officer for this group of children? What are the proper 
activities for such an officer? 
10. What are the factors affecting consolidation which ought 
to be considered by the superintendent in any proposal which 
he makes in this field?

PROBLEM 74 
PLATOON SCHOOL 
Problem: An overcrowded elementary school in the foreign 
section of a southern city requires reorganization. Shall the 
platoon organization be used? If so, what additions must be 
made to the plant, what staff of teachers provided, and what 
is the most adequate program that can be developed? 
Nearly half of the pupils in the schools of the city of 
Knightsburg, 8. K., come from Latin-American homes. In 
most of these homes English is not spoken. In a large per- 
centage of cases both father and mother work in the factories. 
Only the meagerest adjustment has been made in the schools 
to meet any special needs of the children from these homes. 
The only adjustment of any importance is the provision of a 
year of pre-first grade work for the teaching of English. 
Upon facing this situation the new superintendent of schools 
called a meeting of supervisory officers and principals and put 
the situation before them. The result of the conference was 
the choice of the Washington School as a center for beginning 
a program of better adjustment. The Washington School has 
1,338 pupils, in grades one to six. Practically all of these 
pupils (99.5%) are Latin-American. 
Steps were immediately taken to bring together data bearing 
upon the problem of organization and classification. Age, 
progress, health, and mental and achievement test data were 
obtained. Comparison with other schools was made. Table 
1 summarizes the age-grade data; Table 2 the grade-progress 
information. Table 3 contrasts the Latin-American and Amer- 
ican children who are in the junior high schools. Table 4 gives 
the time allotments as the present programs provide. Table 5 
gives the achievement of the various grades in standard tests.

Before the above data were made available it was decided 
that the only possible way to bring a more enriched program to 
these children was by departmentalizing the additional activ- 
ities, at least until the teachers could be trained to teach the 
additional subjects. This position was fortified by the dis- 
closure from an analysis of the housing situation that it would

be desirable to care for 1,600 children in this school. The hous- 
ing investigation showed also that it would be undesirable to 
add more rooms in this location since the congestion would be 
relieved after a few years by the conversion of space now used 
for other purposes. 
With these two considerations dictating the use of a form 
of platoon school organization, the principal set about the task 
of building up a program. He developed two plans. Plan I 
is designed to care for forty sections (1,600 pupils) with the 
addition of four play courts only to the present plan. The 
plan does not properly care for certain classes according to 
his wishes, since certain classes (those in parentheses in Plan 
I) get an extra amount of either play or auditorium with cor- 
respondingly less in other activities. This plan requires 
twenty-three home room teachers and fourteen special 
teachers.

Plan IT is designed to care for these children in the way the 
principal thinks they should be cared for. It requires four 
extra rooms in addition to the play courts. It requires four 
additional special teachers. 
Table 9 (page 531) shows the allotment of time to special 
activities under the two plans.

  532 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
Assignment 
1. Criticize the utilization of plant under the two plans. 
2. The present length of school day can be retained, if 
thirty minute periods are used. Is there sufficient justifica- 
tion for lengthening the school day? 
8. Would it be advisable to provide a shorter school day for 
the lower grades? 
4. Would a different division of play activities and home 
room work be desirable? 
5. What changes in emphasis in the curriculum that has 
been set up would you suggest? 
6. Contrast the two plans with respect to (a) adjustment 
to the needs of these children, (b) the use of teachers. 
7. How would your equipment for the industrial arts, sci- 
ence and music rooms differ in Plan II from that in Plan I? 
8. The principal plans to have the teachers of the pre-first 
grade classes (six of them) follow their children throughout 
the day. This requires three more teachers than would other- 
wise be required. Is this justified? 
9. What are the possibilities for homogeneous grouping in 
Plan I? 
10. If children are grouped homogeneously to the degree 
possible, would you make adjustment in terms of time on a 
semester’s work? If so, how would you administer it in the 
home rooms? In the special activities? 
11. If children are grouped homogeneously to the degree 
possible, would you recommend that the curriculum be differ- 
entiated? If so, how would you bring it about? Would it 
affect the home rooms? The special rooms? 
12. In the light of test results, suggest the subjects and the 
time allotment in the home rooms for the best group in three, 
the average group and the middle group for three different 
grades. Would you expect this to be the same from year to 
year? If not, how would you correct it? Does it take care of 
the needs of all of the children? If not, how would you go 
about it to make further adjustment to the needs of pupils in 
either time or curriculum? 
13. Would you have all groups the same size, regardless of 
ability? 
 
-P-A-G-E-551
  
LOCAL SCHOOL SYSTEMS 533 
14. State in as great detail as possible the necessary steps 
for the principal to take to insure the best type of classification 
possible. Include the type of additional class organizations, 
and all adjustments of individual differences that are de- 
manded by the data available. 
15. Do these plans provide sufficiently for guidance? For 
the benefits of socialized work? For the benefits of the project 
method? If not, what adjustments will introduce the proper 
provision for these items? 
16. Upon what should promotions be based in this type of 
organization? 
17. Outline a system of records for this school? 
18. What steps should be taken to obtain the support of 
the teachers for the new type of organization? 
19. Submit a plan for the opening day of this school.

CONTINUATION SCHOOLS 
Problem: The continuation school work is just getting under 
way. What ideals should be’set up toward which the director 
of continuation classes may work? 
State Law of New York 
The State Law of New York reads, in part, as follows: * 
Part-time or continuation schools shall be established in cities 
. . population over 5,000. 
a. Boards in cities in which there are 20 or more minors above 14 
and below 18, not in regular attendance, shall establish part- 
time classes in which such minors shall receive instruction. 
d. Boards to begin to maintain part-time classes in September 
1920, and shall annually thereafter in September open addi- 
tional classes so that by the opening of the public school in 
September 1925, a sufficient number of schools shall have been 
established to afford instruction to minors required to attend. 
e. Each minor under 18, not attending school or who is lawfully 
employed, unless a high school graduate, shall attend. Attend- 
ance not less than four hours per week. School authorities 
may increase hours per week and decrease number of weeks, 
subject to approval of State Commissioner. Twenty hours 
attendance per week required of minors out of regular employ- 
ment. 
i. Firms employing minors between ages of 14 and 18 years shall 
permit attendance when part-time school is established. Upon 
termination of employment, employer shall return within three 
days the employment certificate of such minor by mail to the 
school. 
The Situation in Farm Center, New York 
Farm Center is a city with 30,000 inhabitants. The chief in- 
dustry is paper manufacture. 
There is a director of continuation schools who supervises 
this phase of the city’s educational work. He teaches eight 
hours a week and has the rest of the time free for directing

the continuation work. He began his work less than a year 
ago. 
Five teachers, in addition to the director, take part in the 
instruction of the continuation classes. They teach part-time 
in the regular day schools and part-time in the continuation 
school. Some of the classes are held in an elementary school 
and some in the high school. 
In keeping a record of continuation school attendance, the 
accompanying 3 x 5 card is used:

ATTENDANCE RECORD 
Subjects 
No data existed in summarized form concerning the make-up . 
of the continuation school group as concerns their age, school- 
ing, quality of school work, mentality, or present employment. 
The director estimated that 175 were enrolled as follows: 5 
per cent fourteen years old, 75 per cent fifteen, and 20 per cent 
sixteen. Some had had but fourth grade training, some had 
progressed as far as the second year in high school before 
enrolling. 
No program of coéperation with the managements of im- 
portant local industries has as yet been worked out. No plan

for assisting attendants in securing desirable employment has 
been formulated. 
The director spends some time in enforcing attendance of 
those enrolled—visiting homes, conferring with parents, etc. 
The attendance officer gives some help in this work, but not a 
great deal, due to other attendance demands. No adequate 
method of insuring that all eligibles are enrolled is in force. 
The content of the curriculum of the continuation groups 
appears to be principally vocational. 
Assignment 
1. What information would you ask the director of the con- 
tinuation school to collect? What codperation, if any, would 
you offer from other departments of the school system? 
2. How would you propose that the curriculum of this 
school be developed? What members of the staff would you 
appoint to such a committee? 
3. What methods would you employ to secure the codpera- 
tion of employers?

   PROBLEM 76 
CONTINUATION SCHOOLS 
Problem: To discover the need for a continuation school, the 
needed equipment of plant and to establish a satisfactory cur- 
riculum. As 
Mr. E. W. Brown is superintendent of schools in Ellsworth, 
N. K., a city of 25,000 population. The state has adopted a 
continuation school law which requires that all minors who are 
over fourteen and have completed the eighth grade and who 
are not in regular attendance at full time school must attend 
continuation school until they become eighteen years of age. 
The superintendent, assisted by members of the staff, has made 
a preliminary study of the continuation school problem as it 
exists in his city with the following result: : 
The Probable Enrolment 
There are about 500 boys and girls who would be required 
to attend. These are divided about evenly and are engaged in 
the following employments: 
          Boys Girls 
Papersmills-<.6%. 82 oi ones Knitting factories ....... 30

Available Building and Equipment 
There is available for the use of the continuation school a 
separate building with kitchen, sewing room, millinery, laun- 
dry, dining room and nursing room for the home economics 
department, typewriting room and bookkeeping room for the 
commercial department, and drafting room, print shop, ma- - 
chine shop, electrical shop and wood shop for the industrial 
department. In addition, there is a science room, assembly 
room, four classrooms and offices.

Federal and State Requirements 
The Smith-Hughes law recognizes three types of continua- 
tion school work. The first is trade extension which is the ex- 
tension of training of a group who are already engaged in some 
particular occupation. The second is trade preparatory. This 
is the special training of a group who have selected some trade 
and are preparing to enter it. The third is general con- 
tinuation. 
The federal board requires that fifty per cent of the school 
time be devoted to shop work for the trade extension and 
trade preparatory classes. The remainder of the day is pro- 
portioned between “related” and “academic” subjects. Home 
economics, commercial education and industrial education re- 
ceive federal aid. This applies to teachers’ salaries only and 
must be matched by state funds. The state has accepted the 
federal restrictions and appropriated funds to reimburse the 
local communities for fifty per cent of the amount spent for 
teachers’ salaries up to a maximum of $15,000. 
Division of Students into Case Groups 
The preliminary survey indicates that there will be great 
variation in the preparation, ability and interests of the 
students. They are to come from public, private and parochial 
schools. Some have but fifth grade education and others have 
had two or three years of high school. It is decided to classify 
them into case groups and for this purpose the following data 
are to be secured. 
a. 
b. Qe . Intelligence quotient. 
. Vocational interests, present employment, wages, ambi- 
. Abilities and aptitudes as determined by aptitude and 
‘association tests. 
. Student selection of courses from the list of the school

Organization of the Curriculum 
The staff have studied the organization of the curriculum 
and in order to have the instruction as flexible as possible, each 
subject is to be divided into short unit courses of ten lessons 
each. Programs are to be arranged according to the individual 
needs and choice of the pupils. Each student will select one 
major activity which will take half the day. Subjects needed 
to meet individual deficiencies will next be added to the pro- 
gram. The student may select the remainder of his program 
with the approval of his adviser. |

KINDERGARTEN EDUCATION 
‘ | 
Problem: Kensington, with a population of 20,000, is a city of 
the third class in a state which has the following permissive 
law for the establishment of kindergartens: 
Title 15, Article 9. Consolidated School Law 
Sec. 24. The school authorities of any union free or common 
school district, located in any county having less than one million 
inhabitants, may establish and maintain one or more free kinder- 
garten schools. The money for the support of such schools shall be 
raised in like manner as for the support of the other public schools 
of such district. No child under the age of four years shall be 
admitted to the schools, and the local school authorities are hereby 
empowered to fix the highest age limit of children who may attend. 
All teachers employed in these schools shall be licensed in accord- 
ance with rules and regulations established by the superintendent 
of public instruction, and shall each share in the distribution of 
district quotas. The attendance of children under the age of five 
years who may be enrolled in the schools shall be reported 
separately and shall be counted in the distribution of public money. 
You have been asked by the board of education to prepare a 
report on the kindergartens of this city. 
Soon after this law was put into effect, the superintendent of 
Kensington stated in his annual report that he hoped to be 
able to establish kindergartens as soon as crowded conditions 
in the elementary schools were relieved. He clearly stated the 
aims of kindergarten education to be, “the a : 
mental power through self-activity” and claimed that ‘ 
perience shows that kindergarten children outstrip in whicel 
advancement those without it.” 
In 1902, the first kindergarten was established with an age 
entrance of 5 to 6 years. Within two years four kindergartens 
were started and the age of entrance was lowered to include 
541
-P-A-G-E-560
542 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
four-year-old children. One reason for this was stated in this 
way, “So many children leave school at the age of 14 that the 
kindergarten gives them an added year of school life.” 
The course of study as outlined in 1904 remains today prac- 
tically the same. It is as follows: “At the end of the first 10 
weeks of each term, the teacher should decide the number of 
children to be admitted to the 1B grade at the end of the 
term and should give to this group advanced work in primary 
numbers, reading and writing. In number work, no figures 
need be used but pupils should gain a comprehension of num- 
bers up to six; be able to count by one to thirty, by twos to 
twenty and by threes to fifteen and to recognize quickly groups 
of objects by twos and threes to six. In reading, teach by the 
word method the first thirty pages of the Ward Primer. Pupils 
should be able to reproduce short stories and to recite short 
poems. They should be taught the days of the week and the 
months of the year; the seasons and the six primary colors. 
They should be able to recognize the common flowers and 
birds.” The superintendent does not seem to realize that such 
a curriculum is far from common practice in kindergartens 
today. 
The introduction of the school “arts” into the kindergarten 
curriculum seems to have been forced by public disapproval of 
the informal practice of kindergarten work. The superintend- 
ent mentions this in his 1906 report and defends informal in- 
struction on the grounds that it is best suited to the child’s age. 
He reiterates that kindergarten training assures more rapid 
progress through the grades. He fortifies his defense of kinder- 
gartens by forcing primary work into its curriculum, thus satis- 
fying the patrons that the children are not wasting time. In 
his 1909 report he comments on the value of engaging kinder- 
garten teachers who have had a primary training which 
enables them to carry their children into the school “arts” as 
soon as the children are able to do this work. 
The kindergarten teachers have followed the required course 
of study, but have supplemented it by adding larger materials, 
widening the experiences offered to the children and provid- 
ing a freer organization of time. These changes are all found 
in modern approved schools. The teachers have attended 
summer sessions at colleges and during the school year conduct 
 
-P-A-G-E-561
  LOCAL SCHOOL SYSTEMS 543 
a study group among themselves to discuss denies of current 
professional interest. They have no leader among the admin- 
istrators of the school system, and they have little or no codp- 
eration between themselves and the primary teachers. The 
kindergartners are on a lower scale of salaries than the other 
elementary teachers. In situations where there is but one 
teaching session, they spend the rest of the school day either 
assisting in primary grades, visiting in the children’s homes or 
doing clerical work for the principal. 
At the present time, children are admitted to the kinder- 
garten at the age of four. They are promoted to the first grade 
on the basis of chronological age, at five and a half years. Ac- 
cording to the normal age established by common practice in 
this country, there are 44 per cent of the children who are 
under age. Where there are two sessions of kindergarten a 
day, the elder children attend in the morning. The average 
daily attendance is small, averaging about fifteen children a 
session. The ratio of first grade children having had kinder- 
garten training is high, 73 out of every 100 first grade children 
having attended kindergarten. 
An effort has been made to test the assertion made by the 
superintendent that kindergarten training improves the 
pupils’ speed of progress and achievement in the school sub- 
jects. For 527 fifth grade pupils in this city, the following 
scores were found: National Intelligence, Thorndike-McCall 
Reading, Woody Fundamentals in Arithmetic, and the Stone 
Reasoning in Arithmetic. But a fraction of one per cent dif- 
ference in achievement between the two groups of pupils was 
discovered, the advantage leaning more toward the non-kin- 
dergarten trained child. As measured in years, the average 
progress varied but two months; these two months being to the 
advantage of the kindergarten child. To make the comparison 
more accurate, groups of pupils equal in number and equal in 
intelligence having kindergarten training and without such 
training were compared for rate of progress and degree of 
achievement. The results were practically the same as in the 
non-selected group. The kindergarten pupil, however, enter- 
ing the first grade at a month younger in age chronologically 
than the non-kindergarten trained pupil was six months 
younger chronologically in the fifth grade. No evidence of the
-P-A-G-E-562
     
    544 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
value of the primary subjects taught in the kindergarten is 
shown by this test. The advantage appears to be in the length 
of the school life. 
No cost items for salaries, equipment or supplies expended 
for kindergartens are provided in Kensington. There is, then, 
no possibility of comparing its cost per child in average daily 
attendance with that of its elementary children or with that 
listed from any other city or state. 
Modern scientific students of Child Welfare prophesy that 
nursery schools will become a part of the public schools of this 
country. Dr. Bird Baldwin in his Psychology of the Pre- 
School Child says: “It will not be long before the public 
school will recognize its duty toward the younger children, not 
to relieve the mothers of the care of this important period in 
education, but to help direct this care in the light of scientific 
analysis of the child and the methods of training.” 
Assignment 
1. Was the superintendent’s original aim sound? Has he 
adhered to it? 
2. Is the kindergarten an added year of school life at the 
lower end, taking the place of the ninth year removed from 
the elementary school? 
8. What principles of curriculum-making are common to 
the kindergarten and to all the elementary grades? Can they 
be applied here? 
4, What proper place in the kindergarten curriculum have 
history, civics, geography, reading, mathematics and science? 
5. What administrative adjustments would bring instant 
professional inspiration to the kindergartens and harmonize 
the kindergarten and primary work? 
6. What admittance age for kindergarten will best fit that 
now planned for the elementary school? What deviations 
from this age would certain localities require? Could these 
deviations be made? What effect upon first grade promotion 
should kindergartens produce? Can you vindicate Mr. Root’s 
assertion “that kindergartens reduce retardation, decrease lia- 
bility of failure and elimination and increase the school life of 
the child by four to five ‘months’? 
7. Has kindergarten education been discredited by the find-
-P-A-G-E-563
  LOCAL SCHOOL SYSTEMS 545 
ings of the tests of progress and achievement? Would not a 
unit within a year preceding kindergarten attendance, while 
the child is in the home, and a year succeeding kindergarten 
attendance give more scientific and accurate evidence of the 
growth effected through kindergarten attendance? 
8. What information regarding the cost of equipment, in- 
struction, and activities of the kindergarten should be avail- 
able in the superintendent’s office? 
9. Should the superintendent accept this prophecy as 
merely a vision or should he make himself acquainted with all 
available literature and experiments in the field of pre-school 
education? 
10. In the light of references listed, what program could be 
initiated to satisfy the superintendent’s assertion that the 
kindergarten is an element contributing to pupil achievement 
and progress; to assist the teachers in their effort to do pro- 
gressive work; and to educate and satisfy the patrons to ap- 
preciate that education takes place without formal, prescribed 
and traditional practice? |

For Case II, assume the same policy and attitude toward 
education as given for Case I, but scale the situation down to 
what you would consider would prevail in a typical city of 
100,000 population. 
CASE III 
As in Case II, make the same general assumption as in Case 
I, but formulate your organization upon the basis of a city of

   PROBLEM 79 
THE SUPERVISION OF INSTRUCTION 
Problem: You have been elected superintendent of schools in 
the city of Woodston. A preliminary survey of the situation 
during the first four months of your administration reveals 
the need for the development of a more adequate program of 
supervision. Among the facts that you have assembled are 
those which follow. 
A study of the work of the supervisory and administrative 
staff of the city of Woodston reveals the fact that the superin- 
tendent of schools has not been given the support which he 
should have. The cost of supervision and administration in 
Woodston as compared with thirteen other cities of approxi- 
mately the same size in the state in which it is located shows 
a very much smaller expenditure per pupil than is found in 
the other cities. 
The teachers in Woodston have been selected almost entirely 
from the immediate locality. They have had little or no 
experience elsewhere. They are not so well trained as those 
in similar cities in the state. You observe that they are per- 
sons of good ability who are interested in their work and eager 
to improve. The salaries paid are fair. The salary schedule 
in effect allows for advancement of teachers on the basis of 
experience only. Few teachers have attended summer school. 
Only three have had leave of absence during the past ten years 
for the sake of attending professional schools. The situation 
with respect to the classification and progress of children in 
the school system is indicated in the following tables.

The situation in regard to the course of study follows in 
some detail: 
The courses of study in use in the city emphasize the more formal 
elements in the curriculum. No provisions have been made for the 
adaptation of courses of study to the needs of special groups of 
children. Many children in the Woodston schools complete the 
period of compulsory education and leave school before they have 
reached the sixth grade. One-third of all of the children do not 
reach the eighth grade, and one-fourth do not reach the seventh 
grade.

The teaching staff of the Woodston schools will rank well in 
respect to personality and native ability. The individuals are loyal 
to the interests of the schools and energetic in their efforts to 
achieve results. There were abundant evidences of respect for 
those in charge of the schools, and of a friendly interest in asso- 
ciates. While there was a complete lack of “fault finding,” yet 
some teachers gave evidence of careful thought regarding possible 
improvements in the school. 
The school officials of Woodston have recognized that it may be 
helpful for one teacher to observe the work of another. The by- 
laws and regulations of the board provide that “teachers shall be 
allowed two half days in the school year for visiting grades similar 
to their own in some other school.” Principals are allowed two days 
for such visiting. Teachers who take advantage of this privilege 
are required to give full reports at a teachers’ meeting in their 
school. 
The school officials are required to deal with some serious prob- 
lems connected with instruction. Differences in ability of pupils, 
varying home conditions, and the individual characteristics of 
teachers are certain to make differences in the difficulties that exist 
in the various schools. In no other school, however, are the diffi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-576
  558 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
culties as pronounced as they are in the No. 3 school. Here a 
startling number of pupils are repeating their work. About 77 in 
each 100 pupils are thus behind their grades. The school is 
burdened by those who have failed and are now more than a year 
behind the grades where they should be. A very small proportion 
of the children who enter this school complete the grammar grades. 
The unsatisfactory conditions in the No. 3 school cannot be traced 
to a poorer staff than is found in other city schools. These teachers 
and the principal are no less energetic than those elsewhere. They 
are compelled, however, to deal with difficulties that are to a large 
extent peculiar to this school. Chief among these is the child who 
has difficulty with the language. It is safe to assume that none of 
these teachers nor the principal has had special training for this 
task. This again is not their fault. Even now there are very few 
places where such training could be obtained. The teachers and 
the principal are aware that trouble exists. 
City examinations made up by committees of teachers supple- 
ment the state examinations of the upper grades. These examina- 
tions are given in all grades above the third where the state ex- 
aminations are not given. Careful comparison of questions from 
these lists reveals striking similarity of material covered. Classroom 
practice reveals a tendency to push lower and lower into the grades 
those skills required to pass creditable examinations of later grades. 
In every school may be found lists of questions given in former 
examinations which have been kept on file for ten years or more. 
Frequently even near the beginning of the term these examinations 
lists are used as the assignment for lessons. Teachers admit and 
defend the regular use of them as often as once per week up to the 
last month or six weeks of the term, and during this period as 
often as three times per week. In this way the accumulated lists 
practically constitute the course of study above the third grade. 
Woodston uses the courses that have been distributed by the 
state. The extent to which an effective course of study must be a 
local matter is a debatable question. It is a fact, however, that the 
teachers in Woodston have found it undesirable to follow exactly 
some parts of the different state courses. As a result they have con- 
sidered and proposed changes and additions that have been accepted 
by the school officials. Such changes are included in a supple- 
mentary course of study published in the annual reports of the 
Woodston public schools. Except as the state courses, supple- 
mented by the local courses, are likely to lack a desirable unity, 
they compare favorably with most of the courses found in cities 
elsewhere.
-P-A-G-E-577
   SUPERVISION OF INSTRUCTION 559 
The courses of study, however, do not even in theory determine 
the character of education in Woodston. What shall be taught 
and the relative emphasis that each topic shall receive is generally 
controlled by the examinations that have been given in previous 
years. Teachers and other school officials were emphatic in their 
statements that these examinations rather than the courses of study 
determined what is taught and also the way in which teaching 
is done. 
The importance that is attached to examinations in Woodston has 
resulted in making the schools efficient machines for training chil- 
dren to pass these tests; but this emphasis means that both the 
state and the city courses of study are largely ignored in practice, 
and drill on examination questions takes their place. Moreover, 
the school authorities tend almost unconsciously to judge a teacher’s 
worth to the system on the basis of her ability to anticipate what 
questions the examiners will ask and to prepare her children for 
them, rather than on the basis of her ability to teach the subject 
matter included in the course of study. In every school one particu- 
lar teacher was mentioned as being one whose pupils always passed 
the examinations. By implication this person was a model for 
the staff. 
A situation similar to that which exists in the elementary schools 
is found in the high school. 
There are five curricula offered in the Woodston High School. 
Of these, two aim at college preparation, the college preparatory 
of the traditional classical type, and the mathematical, preparing 
for engineering schools. The “general course” is composed of 
courses mainly of the college preparatory type, requiring more 
science and history and less mathematics and foreign language. 
Graduates of this curriculum also enter college. The “teachers 
course” requires four years of English, two of mathematics, three 
and a half years of history and civics, three years of science, a year 
and a half of drawing and design, and three years of music. This 
is the only curriculum of which music forms a part. The graduates 
of this course enter normal schools and the Woodston Training 
School. There are two other curricula having vocational aims. The 
commercial is designed to train bookkeepers and stenographers. 
The “course in home making” represents a weak attempt to meet 
the needs of girls, in which the administration of the school ap- 
parently has little interest. 
Table 7 shows the percentages of the total number of pupils at 
present taking each subject. Parallel columns afford comparison 
with New York State, two adjacent states, New Jersey and Massa- 
chusetts, and with the country as a whole.

   There is no evidence of any underlying principles or careful 
planning in the curricula of the Woodston High School. They 
represent in the main the traditional subject matter, arranged in 
the conventional groups common to the schools of a quarter of a 
century ago. Ancient history is required in three of the curricula in 
spite of the fact that this is optional in most schools. General 
science, which is pursued by more high school pupils than any other 
two science courses combined, is not taught at all in this school. 
The mathematics courses show no effect of the modern changes in
-P-A-G-E-579
  SUPERVISION OF INSTRUCTION 561 
the organization and presentation of subject matter. There is no 
shop work whatever, and only an inconsiderable number take 
courses in drawing and design. The music courses are entirely 
theoretical. No sound of music is heard in the school, even in the 
assembly. The entire enrolment in cooking and sewing, the only 
courses in the field of household arts, is twenty. 
The curriculum pays very little attention to health. There is no 
instruction offered in hygiene and sanitation, except as this may be 
incidentally included in chemistry, physics and biology. The facili- 
ties for physical training greatly limit the possibilities in this field. 
The treatment of physical defects, easily discoverable and capable 
of remedy in youth, is not undertaken. Participation in athletic 
sports is confined to a relatively small number and is aimed less at 
physical development than to the staging of thrilling contests. The 
teacher of physical training has little to do with the football team 
which is in charge of a coach who is not a member of the school 
staff and whose aim is naturally to secure a winning team. 
A study of the percentages of failure in different subjects was 
made for the four years 1920-1924, omitting two semesters in which 
the data were not complete. These percentages are based on the 
number remaining up to the nineteenth week of each semester. A 
very considerable number had left school or had dropped the subject 
before that date. There is no way of knowing what percentage of 
these would have failed had they continued the subject to the end, 
but experience warrants the conclusion that a very large propor- 
tion would have failed. Table 8 gives the percentages of failure 
and of withdrawal from school or class during the past year. For 
purposes of comparison, the results of a study of 6,141 pupils in 
eight high schools in New York and New Jersey are included in 
the table.

PROBLEM 80 
SUPERVISION OF INSTRUCTION 
Problem: What proposals should be made to principals and 
other supervisory officers for their guidance in that part of the 
supervisory activities which involves the visitation of teachers 
and the criticisms of their methods of instruction? 
One reason for the failure of principals and other super- 
visory officers to render efficient service is found in the lack 
of any definite program of activity. The superintendent of 
schools, either in his own person or through an assistant, has 
the obligation to analyze the several types of activity in which 
supervisors should be engaged, and to seek to develop pro- 
cedures adapted to the individual members of the supervisory 
corps, and to the teachers who are at work in the school system. 
Where supervisory principals are employed they should be 
regarded as the chief supervisory officers of the school system. 
All other supervisors should work through them. 
The function of supervision is the improvement of teaching. 
The only satisfactory measure that we have of improvement 
in teaching is found in improvement in learning on the part 
of pupils. 
Supervision as it has to do with the criticism of instruction, 
involving the visitation of teachers at work in the classroom, 
may be thought of as divided into three parts: (1) the actual 
observation of teaching; (2) the supervisor’s diagnosis and 
evaluation of the job being done; (3) the measures decided 
upon for the improvement of the work being done, or for the 
stimulation of the teacher to undertake a type of work not 
observed. 
Principals and other supervisors vary greatly in the tech- 
nique which they employ in each of these fields. Some prin- 
cipals enter the classroom as unobtrusively as possible and 
teachers understand that there is to be no interruption to the 
work which is going on at the time. The principal takes a 
563
-P-A-G-E-582
  564 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
position at the side or rear of the room. His attitude so far as 
it is indicated by facial expression is one of interest in the 
work that is going on. 
Another type of observer always says “Good Morning, Miss 
B.” and not infrequently “Good Morning, Children” and ex- 
pects a similar greeting from teacher and pupils. The theory 
actuating this type of activity proposes that there is a social 
value in this sort of contact between supervisor and teachers 
and children. The principal may even propose that it is im- 
portant to be seated at the front of the room where everything 
that happens comes under his immediate attention. 
Some principals propose that the notes which they take 
while in the room should be left with the teacher. 
Still another type of observation quite commonly found is 
of the very brief sort in which the principal enters the room 
for from two to five minutes, makes no notes, does not speak 
to teacher or pupils and leaves the room to go on to complete 
an inspection of the work going on in every room in the 
building. 
The observations thus far discussed assume that the prin- 
cipal was making his observations as time was available and 
without any very definite scheme for following up any par- 
ticular job or aspect of the work being done. Observations 
may be conducted in which the principal seeks to follow a sub- 
ject until entirely acquainted with the methods employed by 
the individual teacher and until possibly he has completed a 
survey of that part of the teaching for the whole building. 
Any adequate observation of this type would seem to suggest 
the need of observing during the whole recitation period in 
each of the several rooms of the building. 
The observer may desire primarily to study some problem 
of classroom management, of method which is more peculiar 
to any given subject—for example, the moral training that is 
being given in the schools, the degree to which the socialized 
recitation is employed, the acceptance of the project method 
by teachers, the housekeeping in so far as it is under the con- 
trol of teachers, to what degree methods of study are being 
taught, and the like. One who is keen to observe in these 
fields may find illustrations in relatively short visits to classes. 
The second aspect of the observer’s work has to do with 
the diagnosis of the situation as he observes it. It is assumed
-P-A-G-E-583
  
. 
SUPERVISION OF INSTRUCTION 565 
that the principal is thoroughly grounded in the philosophy of 
education, the psychology of teaching, and that he has suf- 
ficient knowledge of the subject matter of the elementary 
school to pass intelligently upon the work which is being done. 
Supervisors quite commonly divide themselves into three 
classes with respect to their handling of the situation from the 
standpoint of evaluating the work observed. There are those 
who respond personally. They tell teachers that their work is 
being well done, or they indicate in some manner a degree of 
disapproval. Other principals take the trouble to point out 
the particular aspect of the work which seems to them to need 
correction and propose the remedies which they believe will 
operate to produce more satisfactory results. They sometimes 
are careful to call attention to teachers, to sources of informa- 
tion, and to discussion that will show the relationship of their 
recommendations to fundamental principles, or even to re- 
searches which have been carried on. This second type of 
observer is apt to find it necessary to have an interview with 
the teacher outside of regular class hours, rather than to at- 
tempt to give the criticism on the occasion of the visit. 
A few principals postpone any discussion of the work which 
they have observed for a day or more and spend considerable 
time in their own work upon the problem presented for their 
consideration. They may even be charged with approving 
methods of work in one classroom which are quite different 
from those they advocate with other teachers. They are even 
charged sometimes with having no common standard which 
they apply in their judging of the work of the teachers under 
their supervision. 
Some principals spend their time almost wholly with the 
weakest teachers in their corps. Those who are doing satis- 
factory work are left to their own devices. It seems possible 
that this may result in less effective work by very competent 
teachers than would be secured under stimulating supervision. 
One who has had experience in the field recognizes the fact, 
of course, that it is very much more difficult to propose experi- 
ments to be undertaken or variations in procedure to be fol- 
lowed by the most competent members of his staff. This does 
not, however, seem to relieve one of the responsibility of super- 
vising competent teachers.

PROBLEM 81 
SELECTION OF TEXTBOOKS 
Problem: How should textbooks be selected? 
In the Eighty-Seventh Annual Report of the Superintend- 
ent of Schools, Cincinnati, 1916, the following procedure for 
selecting textbooks was proposed: 
The slogan “Children First” should be the principal guide in the 
selecting of all books. The Ohio code provides that textbooks must 
be adopted between February 1st and August 1st, 1916, for a five 
year period. The Cincinnati board approved a plan to have repre- 
sentative committees of teachers and principals appointed by the 
superintendent who should carefully consider the course of study 
and the textbooks now in use as well as all others published in the 
same subjects and make recommendations to the superintendent 
not later than May Ist. The superintendent shall then carefully 
consider the reports and report to the board not later than July 1st, 
and in his report he shall state whether the books were recom- 
mended by the committees and reasons for any disagreement 
between his report and that of the committees. He shall not recom- 
mend any book which has not been considered by the committee. 
The board shall make the formal adoption but no book shall be 
adopted which has not been considered by both the superintendent 
and the teachers. 
Two executive committees of seven members each, six elementary 
principals and one member of the Teachers College, were appointed 
to have general executive direction of the subject; one committee 
on basal texts and one on supplementary education. The city was 
divided into three sections and the grades into three groups, 1 to 3, 
4 to 5, and 6 to 8. From each group in each section committees of 
five were appointed in the different subjects, thus making nine 
committees in each subject. This resulted in a careful study of 
each subject by forty-five teachers of that subject. All publishers 
of recognized standing were informed of the plan of procedure and 
were invited to submit samples for the consideration of the 
committees.

  PROBLEM 82 
CURRICULUM REVISION 
Problem: You have just been elected superintendent of 
schools in a city of 50,000 population. The schools for fifteen 
years have been under an unprogressive superintendent and the 
teachers have had little professional stimulation. The course 
of study has had practically no revision for ten years. It con- 
sists largely of page citations of work to be covered by each 
grade in textbooks, many of which are now out of date. In 
response to the invitation of the Department of Superintend- 
ence, you enrol your city in the Codperative Plan for Curricu- 
lum Revision. How would you proceed so that this school 
system might eventually have a modern course of study? 
Assignment 
1. What are some of the major questions of educational 
philosophy involved in curriculum revision? 
2. State definitely some of the outcomes that should come 
from a program of curriculum revision. 
3. Chart and describe the plan of organization for curricu- 
lum revision you would expect to bring about. 
4. What are some of the major problems confronting those 
responsible for the drafting of courses of study in the various 
elementary school subjects? 
5. Describe some of the methods that have been used in 
working toward a scientific solution of some of these problems. 
6. What criteria would you use in judging the merits of a 
specific course of study?

PROBLEM 83 
JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULA 
Problem: Huntstown has three intermediate schools—grades 
7 to 9—offering the traditional curriculum. What curricula 
must be introduced if these schools are to be of the highest 
service to the community? 
Huntstown, S. K., is a rapidly growing industrial city of 
100,000 population. It has 23 elementary schools, three junior 
high schools and a senior high school. Until recently the board 
of education assumed the greater part of the responsibility for 
the administration of the school program. Last fall a new 
superintendent was employed; also three directors were added 
to the supervisory staff—a director of research, a director of 
elementary schools and a director of high schools. 
It was at once evident to the new superintendent that the 
schools were not adjusted to the educational needs of the city. 
The schools in the foreign sections were filled with overage 
pupils. Some of these schools had 95 per cent of the children 
overage for their grades. He found only the slightest varia- 
tion from the traditional schools to meet the needs of these 
children. Also, the enrolment in junior and senior high schools 
was small. The junior high schools were junior high schools 
in name only. The senior high school was of the traditional 
type. 
The first step taken by the superintendent was the formula- 
tion of a curriculum revision committee made up of the three 
. directors and a half-dozen principals. Also, he asked the di- 
rector of research to obtain any statistical data that would be 
helpful in guiding this committee. 
Near the end of the first year the subcommittee working 
on junior high schools presented its outline of curricula for 
the junior high school.

SUGGESTED CURRICULA FOR JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS 
HUNTSTOWN, 8S. K. JUNE 1925 
The six-hour day to be divided into five sixty-minute (clear) 
periods for supervised study and recitation. The remainder of the 
six-hour day, about 30 minutes, to be used for auditorium, home 
room organization, extra-curricular activities, etc.; this would mean 
25 periods per week for each pupil.

With this, the director of research submitted the data given 
in Tables 1 to 7. 
Tables 1 to 3 are age-grade tables of junior and senior 
high schools. Children from the non-English speaking homes 
and those from American homes are represented in separate 
tables. This division of children according to nationality 
promised to be of particular interest since English is the 
native tongue of only approximately a half of the population 
of Huntstown. 
Supplementary to these tables, the elementary age-grade 
studies showed that as many as 16 per cent of the children in 
the elementary schools in the foreign section had attained the 
ages normal for junior and senior high school pupils, whereas 
the corresponding figure in the best American residence section 
was barely 2 per cent. 
Table 4 gives the time allotments to subjects in the ele- 
mentary schools. 
Table 5 gives the courses pursued in the junior high grades. 
Table 6 gives certain test results obtained in the May tests 
of the 6A Grade. Certain test results are also given for junior 
high school pupils. 
Table 7 gives detailed test results in the 6A classes in a 
foreign community school and a school in the best residence 
section, as shown above.

   PROBLEM 84 
THE REVISION OF THE CURRICULUM 
Problem: The curriculum revision work of the Hartsdale pub- 
lic schools was begun in the early part of the school year 
1924-25. The work was a part of a general reorganization 
movement outlined by the new superintendent of schools and 
was generally considered as one of the most outstanding needs 
of the system. A comprehensive outline of the revision pro- 
gram is herewith presented. The work involved the codpera- 
tion of all teachers and supervisors and required on their part 
professional loyalty and devotion to the highest degree. Is 
this system of curriculum revision a practical one which can 
be utilized in other situations? 
Scope of the Work Outlined 
Since the junior high school building program indicated the 
second semester of the school year 1925-26 as the specific time 
when a junior high school curriculum must be presented in suitable 
form for introducing programs of work in these new schools, that 
date was tentatively selected as a time when there should be courses 
of study ready to try out in the new schools. The program as 
decided upon, however, included a revision of the curriculum for 
elementary and senior as well as junior schools. In other words, it 
was decided that there should be a complete revision of the 
curriculum from the kindergarten through the eleventh grade, and 
such changes made wherever changes were necessary as seemed 
advisable. 
It was felt that to the extent that all members of the school 
organization participated in the making of the course of study, the 
teaching staff would as a whole be able to understand, interpret 
and operate it when completed. Therefore, all teachers, including 
supernumeraries and substitutes, were invited to become members 
of one or more committees and to work under the leadership of a 
chairman of that particular group. At first, many of the teachers 
felt that they had little to contribute of value in such an under-

586 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
taking, but gradually as they took up the work, they became more 
and more convinced that each one could do something in the work 
as outlined. 
It was also the opinion of the administration that any organiza- 
tion of workers comprising as many different elements, types and 
degrees of training, experience and varied interests as were repre- 
sented by the teaching staff of the Hartsdale schools would require 
constant codrdination, guidance and stimulation by leaders in the 
different fields of activity. Consequently, there was an attempt 
to place each group under the leadership of some member of the 
staff competent to furnish the necessary guidance and stimulation 
desired. 
It was also recognized that all resources available must be utilized 
to the full, as for example: (a) the ripe experience of the teachers 
themselves in the various subjects and with various types of chil- 
dren; (b) the information of experts in the various fields of subject- 
matter; (c) the information of experts in the various fields of 
science; (d) the results of research investigation and experimenta- 
tion in subject-matter, the learning process, classroom methods, or 
administrative procedure. Those resources were made available to 
the committees as rapidly as possible. 
An understanding acceptable to all was that no change should be 
made in any unit of work in the course of study unless the com- 
mittees in charge were convinced that they could provide some- 
thing superior to that which was taken out. 
The following principles were also accepted for the promotion 
of the work: 
(a) All changes made in the course of study must be justified 
from the standpoint of scientific principles established and accepted 
by modern research as fundamental. 
(b) The course of study as finally accepted must always be con- 
sidered as tentative and subject to modification and change accord- 
to the needs of the city as developed. 
(c) The course of study as written for each subject shall be deter- 
mined by general and specific objectives outlined in advance. 
(d) After the completion of the course of study, it shall be 
checked by experts in each field. 
The Organization 
With these fundamental agreements, the following organization 
was effected. Four types of committees were established: 
1. Subject-matter committees 
2. Administrative committees
-P-A-G-E-605
CURRICULA AND COURSES OF STUDY 587 
3. Research committees 
4. Reviewing committees 
The subject-matter and administrative committees had similar 
organizations in that each was composed of a number of subcom- 
mittees. The subcommittees on subject-matter covered the field of 
English, related arts, foreign language, mathematics, physical educa- 
tion, science and social studies. Each of these subcommittees made 
further subdivisions of committee work, as for example—the sub- 
committee on English had four groups working on reading, writing, 
language, grammar, phonics, composition, literature, spelling and 
English for foreigners. 
The subcommittees on administrative problems were 22 in 
number and covered the following fields: credits and entrance 
requirements; time distribution; supervised study; tests and meas- 
urements; extra-curricular activities; textbook evaluation; promo- 
tion standards; library; retardation and elimination; marking sys- 
tems; equipment; visual education; health work; outcomes; objec- 
tives; teacher qualifications; teacher ratings; curriculum organiza- 
tion; socialization of the curriculum; forms and records; program of 
studies; and terminology. 
The executive committee, composed of 17 members serving under 
the chairmanship of the superintendent of schools, was at the head 
of this organization. This executive committee was composed of 
representatives from each of the seven fields of subject-matter; 
three representatives from junior and senior high schools; four 
representatives from the kindergarten, primary and intermediate 
grades; and one representative each from the special schools, eve- 
ning schools and research department. The duties of this executive 
committee were to formulate the policies, determine the sequence 
of work, afford leadership to the subcommittee and finally pass 
on the work prepared. 
Upon the subcommittees on subject matter devolved the work of 
the preparation of the course of study under the direction and 
leadership of the executive committee. The subcommittees on ad- 
ministration were responsible for the policies relating to the adminis- 
tration of the course of study. To assist the subcommittees in their 
work, research committees on subject-matter and on administration 
were created. 
In the field of subject-matter, the following research committees 
functioned: bibliography; investigations in methods of teaching the 
subject; investigations in subject-matter of the curriculum; specific 
outcomes; projects; correlation with other subjects; objectives; and 
equipment.
-P-A-G-E-606
588 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
In the field of administration, research committees were estab- 
lished to produce results in the following fields: credits and entrance 
requirements; time distribution; supervised study; tests and meas- 
urements; extra-curricular activities; textbook evaluation; pro- 
motion standards; library; retardation and elimination; marking 
systems; equipment; visual education; health work; outcomes; 
objectives; teacher qualifications; teacher ratings; curriculum 
organization; socialization of the curriculum; forms and records; 
program of studies; and terminology. 
In addition to this organization of committees whose function 
was to write the course of study and determine the curriculum, there 
were three reviewing committees whose sole function was to review 
the work done. The first of these was a committee composed of 
supervisors, each of whom was privileged to criticize the work from 
the standpoint of an expert in a limited field of instruction. The 
second was a committee on psychology, the individual members of 
which were to carefully study each unit of work, appraising it from 
the standpoint of the psychologist to see that nothing had crept 
into the course of study that was incompatible with the best 
psychological theory. The third reviewing group was the lay com- 
mittee composed of citizens of Hartsdale whose criticism and sug- 
gestions would be considered valuable in representing to the curricu- 
lum makers what Hartsdale would want for the children of 
Hartsdale. 
The responsibility of the chairmen of the committees was out- 
lined as follows: 
1. Chairmen should be sure that they understand what the execu- 
tive committee expects as a result of each unit of work. They 
should explain and illustrate the problems in sufficient detail so that 
every teacher thoroughly understands what is to be done and how 
to proceed. 
2. The chairmen should feel responsible for the attendance at 
committee meetings and in case of repeated absence should get in 
communication with that member of the committee and find out 
what the trouble is. 
3. The chairmen should feel responsible for keeping accurate ac- 
count of the attendance so that at the end of the year an attendance 
report can be made. 
4. In no instance should a chairman call off a meeting without 
informing each member of the committee to that effect and with- 
out also informing the general chairman in charge of the work. 
5. The chairmen should feel responsible for making each meeting 
of the committee interesting and worth while.
-P-A-G-E-607
  CURRICULA AND COURSES OF STUDY 589 
6. Chairmen should as much as possible take care of the affairs 
of their respective members so that the general chairmen may work 
through the subchairmen. 
The First Unit of Work 
The first unit of work was the selection of the general objectives 
of education. About six weeks was spent by all teachers in this 
study and a bulletin containing the first report of the committee 
set forth the consensus of opinion that the cardinal principles of 
education, as adopted by the National Education Association, 
represented the opinion of the teachers of Hartsdale in this respect. 
The Second Unit of Work 
After submitting the report on the first unit of work, the executive 
committee reported as follows with respect to the next unit to be 
undertaken. 
The general objectives accepted tentatively by the executive com- 
mittee are: health, command of fundamental processes; worthy 
home membership; vocation; citizenship; worthy use of leisure; 
ethical character. 
These must now be specifically stated in terms of activities and 
ideals. For example, “health” has been accepted as a major objec- 
tive of education. However, to say merely that “health” is an 
objective of education without defining it in terms of specific ac- 
tivities and ideals is to do only what has been done for generations 
and does not outline school procedure in sufficient detail to make a 
basis for curriculum construction. How to analyze “health” into 
its component activities and the ideals that control these activities 
will give us this needed basis. To illustrate the foregoing statement, 
we might in our analysis accept Bobbitt’s list of abilities: “the 
ability to take proper precautions against the spread of disease,” 
etc. Or we might use Charters’ method of job analysis. It is pro- 
posed to use the latter. 
A. Method of Procedure: While it has been the tendency of the 
past to base the course of study only on the material constituting 
the fields of systematized knowledge, it is generally felt now that 
this basis is too limited to provide a proper curriculum for the 
following reasons: 
1. The organized fields of knowledge are constantly changing as 
one generation of sciences gives place to the next, so that the 
old organization does not now fit the needs of education. 
2. Modern psychology has proved that the application of knowl- 
edge is more difficult than the acquisition of knowledge and 
therefore the application must be included.  
-P-A-G-E-608
  590 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
3. Modern psychology has proved and advanced practice has 
demonstrated that when knowledge is divorced from the con- 
sciousness of usefulness, it is extremely difficult to motivate. 
4, Students of education are convinced that for youth to properly 
master the problems of youth or to be properly equipped to 
master the problems of adulthood, they must be given instruc- 
tion in the current, unorganized social problems of the day. 
Therefore: The basis of the curriculum must be those activities 
that are found in the activities involved in the everyday life of the 
men and women and children of the present time. 
To arrive at this basis, it is suggested that we first construct a 
list composed of all the activities involved in everyday life of men, 
women and children. Second, that we determine what the ideals 
are that control these activities. Third, that we eliminate from those 
two lists by a step-by-step process (a) all undesirable activities 
and ideals and (b) all activities or ideals that do not need to be 
taught or directed. 
The next step in the process will be to rearrange these lists 
so those activities that are of intrinsic value to the child will stand 
at the head of the list. 
After this, separate lists may be made containing the specific 
activities with their controlling ideals that are of particular 
significance to the different growth stages of the children of Harts- 
dale including as many as may be covered in the time allotted for 
the work. 
B. The Unit of Work Outlined for the Next Three Weeks: A 
committee from the executive committee has outlined 54 topics 
which it is thought will include practically all the normal activities 
of the men, women and children of Hartsdale, except of course the 
strictly vocational pursuits. 
The list is submitted below. Committee assignments have been 
made for each list. Additions to or modifications of this list are 
asked by the committee from any teacher or group of teachers.

By “activity” is meant any mental, physical or emotional re- 
action to stimuli. The stimulus may be a physical object, as for 
example—a ball for which one reaches, or it may be a physical 
situation as an automobile to be driven; it may be a mental situa- 
tion as the determination why the nominative case should be used; 
or it may be an emotional situation as the appreciation of a fine 
picture. 
Bobbitt divides activities into eight groups: observational activi- 
ties; activities involved in the performance of functions; activities 
involved in looking at pictures; the reading activity; activities in- 
volved in intensifying, prolonging and repeating experiences; prob- 
lem-solving activities; and generalizing activities. This grouping 
may not be all-inclusive but it is certainly suggestive. 
It is proposed to submit one of these “fields” to each committee 
of teachers asking them that they proceed as follows: 
Each teacher should list all of the activities that she can think 
of that fall within her field. These activities should be concisely, 
clearly stated and should be quite detailed. The method of analysis 
suggested is that of “job-analysis,” an example of which is quoted 
from Charters: 1 
“Another example of the analysis of a simple job is that of the 
position of application clerk in a department store, which is given 
as follows:

“7, Makes notes of references on blanks and hands to credit chief, 
who passes on them. 
“8, Enters, name, address and number of applications in index. 
“9. Answers requests from other firms for references.” 
In the above list are shown nine duties which the application clerk 
has to perform, and clearly the course of study needed to train such 
a clerk will deal with the nine topics. It should teach him to meet 
people who desire to open accounts, how to ask them for informa- 
tion with which to fill out blanks, how to write form letters, how to 
get information over the telephone, etc. When the student has been 
taught each of these topics according to ideals which would neces- 
sarily be included, all the theory needed by him has been presented. 
For this work, it will be necessary for you to use introspection 
or interviewing, or in some cases it may be possible actually to 
perform the activities involved and get your record from this. The 
idea is to make the list of activities as nearly complete as possible. 
Each teacher should ignore the work done in her particular field by 
other members of the committee as the duplication will be an in- 
teresting study in itself. In the same way, if an activity is repre- 
sented in many fields, it should be listed under each in order that 
we can determine just what this application is, and thus the rela- 
tive importance of different activities. 
It is suggested that each teacher carry with her a notebook in 
which she can record an activity as soon as thought of. This method 
will be found easier than sitting down and trying to think it out. 
After the list is completed, it should be transferred to the slips 
of paper provided for that purpose which may be found in the 
principal’s office, and these should be handed to the chairman of 
your committee. 
There should be only one item on each slip so that the material 
may be easily compiled. 
The Third Unit of Work 
The third unit of work was a study made of waste in education 
by an evaluation of eighteen principles that were suggested as 
fundamental in elimination of waste in education. These principles 
are included in Bulletin B 13. The reaction of the teachers to these 
eighteen principles is attached. 
 
-P-A-G-E-612
594. PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
Buitetin B13 
GENERAL PRINCIPLES TO BE USED AS GUIDES IN CURRICULUM 
MAKING 
There is waste in education—waste in effort and waste in time on the part 
ly the greater share of the blame for this waste may be of the child. Probal 
laid at the door of the curriculum. Let us stud: 
guiding principles and endeavor to remedy it for the situation in the light of 
artsdale. 
  
Waste of Effort and Time on the 
Part of the Child is Prevalent 
in Practice Because: Economy Demands That: 
  
1. Individual 
Differences The curriculum does not 
take into consideration the 
individual differences of chil- 
dren that are the result of 
nationality, home life, geo- 
graphical environment, spe- 
cial abilities or disabilities, 
tradition, different educa- 
tional or vocational des- 
tinies. A flexible curriculum should 
be constructed for Hartsdale 
that will allow for individual 
differences of children, 
whether those consist of dif- 
ferences in abilities, needs or 
destinies. 
  
2. Utilization of 
Instincts and 
Impulses The curriculum materials do 
not utilize to the fullest ex- 
tent the inherited possibili- 
ties of the learning processes, 
rooted in the instinctive and 
impulsive activities and at- 
titudes of children and 
youth.   Educational materials should 
be given in the form of ac- 
tivities or experiences of the 
individual and these activi- 
ties should properly utilize 
the developing, inherent in- 
stincts of the child. 
  
3. Intrinsic Value 
of Subject- 
matter There is included in the cur- 
riculum much material that 
has found its place there and 
held its place there by force 
of tradition, but which has 
no other justification and 
which fills no present-day 
social need of the child. There should be a positive 
justification for all material 
that finds a place in the 
course of study. This posi- 
tive justification should be 
baced upon an_ increased 
ability on the part of the in- 
dividual to grow and should 
be measured in terms of be- 
havior. Material must have 
intrinsic value.   
4. Minimum 
Essentials 
  Practice so far has been de- 
manding that all individuals 
should be given the oppor- 
tunity of receiving a com- 
mon body of knowledge, 
while at the same time ig- 
noring the inherent process 
by which knowledge is 
acquired. The minimum essentials 
which modern educational 
theory asks for should be 
stated in terms of the fixing 
of ideals and attitudes, judg- 
ments and sympathies, as 
WELL as a definable body of 
facts. Minimum essentials, 
however,~ in these various 
fields can be acquired not by 
uniformity of materials and 
pee for all children but 
y a choice of subject-matter 
and methods which will bear 
the same relation to each 
child’s experience although

  Waste of Effort and Time on the

Economy Demands That:

Essentials 
(continued) differing in facts. This al- 
lows every child the oppor- 
tunity of acquiring these 
minimum essentials through 
the medium of hisown experi- 
ence and the same relation- 
ship is preserved although 
the medium differs. 
  
5. Psychological 
Arrangement of 
Subject-matter Most courses of study pre- 
sent a strict adherence to 
the logical arrangement of 
subject-matter. The mate- 
rial is presented from the 
adult standpoint in logical 
sequence. A presentation 
of material to the child as 
organized in the textbook 
requires logical presentation 
and makes it necessary that 
the child proceed from syn- 
thesis to analysis which is 
not the way a child learns. A psychological arrangement 
of material which will allow a 
child ro propucs a synthetic 
process is in strict harmony 
with the learning process. 
The psychological arrange- 
ment of materials is con- 
cerned with sensing the spe- 
cial aptitudes of children in 
order to secure the situation 
that will best further their 
development. 
  
6. Objective 
Standards Many courses of study fail 
to set up objective stand- 
ards of attainment and thus 
resent no criteria of excel- 
lence as a basis for promot- 
ing and grading children. Objective standards should 
be set up for different types 
of material, different units of 
work, different ability groups 
of children at their various 
stages of growth to be used 
as a basis for promotion and 
grading and marking of 
pupils.   
7.. Habit 
Formation There is frequently found to 
be a lack of proper tech- 
nique in habit formation 
and a lack of discrimination 
as to types of materials that 
should be reduced to the 
automatic plane.   There should be a careful 
analysis of each unit of work 
and all materials of the course 
of study with a view to deter- 
mining which facts of infor- 
mation and which educative 
processes should be resolved 
to the automatic plane. After 
this a proper technique 
should be established for 
making automatic the items 
selected.   
8. Diagnosis 
  A lack of expert diagnosis of 
individual difficulties at the 
time that the difficulties are 
occurring results in repeti- 
tion of wrong responses un- 
til such responses are re- 
duced to the automatic 
plane. Expert diagnosis should be 
made of group and individual 
difficulties and remedial 
measures should be provided 
for the use of teachers. These 
remedial measures should be 
applied in the early stages of 
the difficulty to prevent the 
formation of wrong habits.

596 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL 
  ADMINISTRATION 
  
Waste of Effort and Time on the 
Part of the Child is Prevalent 
in Practice Because: Economy Demands That: 
  
9. Administrative 
Machinery Administrative machinery 
is frequently too inflexible 
to carry out a flexible cur- 
riculum program. Guiding principles in educa- 
tional administration as well 
as educational method and 
subject-matter are necessary. 
The so-called “educational 
machinery” must cease to be 
machinery and become a 
better conceived school or- 
ganism that is capable of 
such administratively flexi- 
ble adjustments that it may 
respond easily and quickly to 
the requirements of the new 
social curriculum program. 
This means that the new ad-' 
ministrative program calls 
for buildings so constructed 
that a social curriculum pro- 
gram is possible; that there 
be flexibility in administra- 
tion; and that administrative 
machinery be thought of as 
a means to an end, as an aid 
to the realization of educa- 
tional values rather than as 
the values themselves. 
  
10. Knowledge as 
an Expressive 
Process Over-emphasis of technique 
tends to destroy expression, 
originality, and initiative in 
the individual. Teachers and administrators 
should get a modern concep- 
tion of the psychology of the 
educative processes. They 
should realize that they are 
EXPRESSIVE PROCESSES. 
Knowledge is a real process 
and a real method of expres- 
sion and hence all school ex- 
ercises such as reciting, study- 
ing, student activities, labo- 
ratory technique, auditorium 
performances, shop training, 
projects, socialized class 
meetings—all should have as 
their basis social values. 
  
11. Objectives 
  There is a lack of proper 
and accomplishable objec- 
tives which may be used to 
define units of work and 
produce continuity and co- 
ordination in the school 
program. 
  Specific objectives should be 
set up for each unit of sub- 
ject matter, for each type of 
work, for each activity to be 
used as controls in the ac- 
complishment of the work. 
These objectives should be so 
stated that they may be re- 
alized by the group of chil- 
dren in the time that is set 
aside for that purpose. These

CURRICULA AND COURSES OF STUDY   
597 
  
Waste of Effort and Time on the Part of the Child is Prevalent 
in Practice Because: Economy Demands That: 
  
11. Objectives 
(continued) objectives should be realized 
either in terms of actual ac- 
complishment or in terms of 
progress towards the goal. 
  
12. Homogeneous 
Grouping of 
hildren Group instruction is un- 
profitable for large sro 
of children of various abili- 
ties. There should be a homogen- 
eous grouping of children 
which will allow profitable 
group teaching for the major 
portion of school work. 
  
13. Elimination of 
Deferred 
Values Knowledge objectives have 
been set up that are foreign 
to the experience of the 
children. eferred values 
usually carry little moti- 
vating power. All materials of instruction 
should be of maximum good 
to the extent that they are 
pursued. It has been shown 
that economic necessity is 
not as strong a factor in elim- 
ination from school as is 
doubt as to the value of the 
work offered or lack of in- 
terest or success therein. 
Therefore, it is important 
that the work not only be 
adapted to the needs and 
capacities of each pupil but 
also that it should be so pre- 
sented as to convince him 
and his parents that it is of 
real value to him. To do 
this, it is important that each 
subject should be organized 
so that the first year of work 
will be of value to those who 
go no farther and at the same 
time offer a good foundation 
for work of the subsequent 
years. The question should 
be asked, “Is this the best 
material possible for these 
pupils if they were to leave 
school next week?” 
  
14. The Use of 
Educational 
Research 
  For the last few years psy- 
chology and research have 
been working to develop the 
best methods and the best 
material to be used in the 
educative process. The 
field is only partly covered 
so far but educational prac- 
tice is not utilizing the find- 
ings of psychology and re- 
search to the fullest extent. 
  There are many problems in- 
volved in the making of the 
curriculum that should (1) 
be solved by methods of re- 
search and (2) be solved by 
utilizing research study al- 
ready made. For example: 
1. The effect of visual aid 
upon the efficiency of in- 
struction. 
2. The relative values of dif- 
ferent methods of instruction 
in various fields.

  3. The effects of fatigue upon 
the child. 
4. The books best adapted 
for the use of foreigners. 
5. The relative merits of in- 
struction by the departmen- 
talized plan as compared 
with the one-teacher plan. 
6. The effect of size of class 
upon the efficiency of in- 
struction. 
7. The “reading age’’ neces- 
sary for the satisfactory use 
of each state text. 
8. The mental age at which 
the study of numbers may 
most economically be intro- 
duced. 
9. The relative value of sep- 
arating the subjects of in- 
struction in the primary 
grades as compared to the 
method of ignoring the arti- 
ficial boundaries between sub- 
jects which in daily life are 
not thusartificially separated. 
10. The proper and most 
economical method of de- 
creasing vocalization in read- 
ing, ete. 
  
15. Formal 
Discipline 
and Transfer 
of Training Tradition dictates the in- 
clusion of material in the 
course of study because of 
disciplinary values. Modern psychology teaches 
us that subject-matter should 
be selected and arranged in 
accordance with the two 
outstanding principles: (1) 
General transfer is not auto- 
matic and inevitable; (2) 
There is no general desirable 
discipline value from what is 
merely difficult or distasteful. 
There should be a positive 
justification for all materials 
of the curriculum. 
  
16. Retardation The lack of adaptation of 
the curriculum to the needs 
and therefore the interests 
and to the capabilities of the 
child results in retardation 
and in many cases in elim- 
ination. The curriculum should be so 
constructed that it exempli- 
fies the principle that nvERY 
CHILD HAS A RIGHT TO SUC- 
CEED. 
  
17. Educational 
Guidance   There is much “muddling” 
on the part of children in The curriculum should be so 
constructed that the inter-

Guidance 
(continued) the selection of their work 
due to the lack of knowl- 
edge as to their individual 
capacities, tastes and apti- 
tudes. ests, aptitudes, and capaci- 
ties of pupils may be ex- 
plored by means of worth- 
while material which will en- 
able them later to select defi- 
nite lines of work and pursue 
them with pleasure and profit. 
  
18. Social Basis 
of the 
Curriculum 
  Materials of the curriculum 
frequently represent knowl- 
edge divorced from the con- 
sciousness of usefulness. 
  Modern psychology has 
proved and advanced prac- 
tice has demonstrated that 
for youth to proper! mina 
the problems of youth or tobe 
properly equipped to master 
the problems of adulthood, 
he must be given instruction 
IN THE CURRENT, UNORGAN- 
IZED SOCIAL PROBLEMS OF 
THE pay. Therefore, the 
basis of the curriculum should 
be those activities that are 
found to be the activities in- 
volved in the everyday life of 
the men, women and children 
of the present time. In other 
words, the first duty of the 
school is to teach the chil- 
dren to do better the desir- 
able things they would do 
anyway. The second duty 
of the school is to reveal to 
children higher activities and 
to make these desires and 
then to help children to rea- 
lize these desires. 
  
The foregoing eighteen principles were considered by the execu- 
tive committee as fundamental in curriculum building. It was 
urged that the teachers study each principle carefully until it was 
thoroughly understood. After this, the application of the principle 
should be tested out in various fields. For instance, a teacher should 
consider the application of each principle to the field of work as- 
signed to her committee. For example, the members of the com- 
mittee on literature should carefully test the application of each 
principle to the study of literature and see what the result would 
be if it were to be put into effect. The committee on supervised 
study should likewise make the application to the subject of super- 
vised study, etc., for each committee. After the principles have 
been tested in the field for which the different teachers are re-
-P-A-G-E-618
  600 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
sponsible, then its application might be tested in other fields in 
which the individual happens to be interested. Each principle is 
far-reaching in its effect upon the entire curriculum and should be 
tested in as many fields as possible. 
Indicate in the space to the left your reaction to these principles. 
If the list of principles does not seem adequate, or if items are in- 
cluded that seem superfluous, please indicate this. 
The Fourth Unit of Work 
The fourth unit of work was a study and a tentative report on 
the specific objectives for each subject of the curriculum. 
Assignment 
1. Is the work in curriculum revision, as outlined, a legiti- 
mate task to assign classroom teachers? 
2. What part should a state play in the development of this 
curriculum? 
3. Is the program, as outlined, too ambitious to run concur- 
rent with the regular work of the classroom? 
4. What are the cardinal principles of education as adopted 
by the National Education Association? 
5. Wherein lies the value of the time spent on the first unit 
of work? 
6. Could not the problem of curriculum revision be solved 
by a smaller committee of expert workers rather than through 
the agency of the complex organization which has been set up? 
7. What part of the school day should be set aside for work 
of this kind? 
8. Should the chairman be relieved of other school respon- 
sibilities, having assumed the chairmanship of a curriculum 
committee? 
9. What advantages accrue from the organization of the 
work as outlined? 
10. What particular gain can be expected from the second 
unit of work? Is this not the task of a state organization 
rather than of individual teachers? 
11. Are the 54 normal activities as outlined through the 
executive committee mutually exclusive? To what degree are 
they valuable in the further work of curriculum development?
-P-A-G-E-619
  CURRICULA AND COURSES OF STUDY 601 
12. Contrast Charters’ method of selection of activities 
through job analysis and Bobbitt’s eightfold division of 
activities. 
13. Are the 18 principles, as outlined in the third unit of 
work, all-inclusive? 
14. To what degree is this type of curriculum work being 
done in the United States? What has resulted from the time 
spent by the teaching staff on this type of work? 
15. Can the Board of Education be justified in employing 
teachers whose time for a whole or a large part of the year may 
be set aside for curriculum development? 
16. What percentage of the budget for instructional service 
should a Board spend upon safeguarding the curriculum? 
17. Is the curriculum problem of a small city school system, 
5,000 to 10,000, similar to that of a large school system of from 
100,000 to 200,000? Explain.

PROBLEM 85 
RELIGIOUS EDUCATION IN RELATION TO PUBLIC 
SCHOOLS 
Problem: There has been considerable agitation in the small 
city in which you are superintendent of schools with respect to 
the desirability of developing religious education under the 
auspices of the board of education. It has been pointed out 
that public school systems in a great many communities have 
codperated in this type of work. Your board of education has 
asked you to investigate and to recommend the action which 
they should take. 
The city in which you are working is situated in an agri- 
cultural community in the eastern part of Nebraska. It is a 
typical American community with little foreign or colored 
population. The city has churches representing twelve differ- 
ent denominations. Not more than 50 per cent of the popula- 
tion attend church and less than half of the children are 
regularly enrolled in Sunday School. Interdenominational 
rivalry is very keen. 
There are those in each sect that constantly promote the 
idea that the motives of other sects are wrong and that they 
cannot be trusted. A superficial review of the situation in- 
dicates that the morality of the community is about that which 
one would find in small cities throughout the country. Certain 
well-meaning citizens are convinced that the young people of 
the community are very much less moral than were the young 
people of their own generation. They charge what they think 
is a prevailing moral laxity to the failure of the public schools 
to give training in morals. The more militant of the church 
group are insisting that instruction be given centering on the 
reading of the Bible and that a definite period be set aside 
every day for this work. 
There are others in the community who recognize the diffi- 
culty involved in giving religious education as a part of the 
work of the public school. They point out the variation in 
603
-P-A-G-E-622
604 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
interpretation among the several denominations and the right 
of each to have its children receive only such religious instruc- 
tion as it considers desirable. 
A considerable part of the agitation has centered around a 
test which has been given in the schools to determine the 
degree to which children are familiar with the Bible. Among 
the questions which were included in this test as given to high 
school pupils are the following:

3. Who was the man that endured many trials and hardships 
and has been regarded as a man of great endurance? 
. Who was the first king of the Israelites? 
. When God became so displeased with the wickedness of the 
people that he would destroy them, who saved them from 
entire extinction? 
. Who was Jacob’s father? 
. Who said, “Entreat me not to leave thee and to return from 
following after thee for whither thou goest, I will go, and 
where thou lodgest I will lodge, thy people shall be my people 
and thy God my God”? 
8. Who said, “Am I my brother’s keeper?”

0. Who received money for a very unworthy act and afterward Who first carried the teachings of Christianity to the Gentiles? 
felt so badly about it that he took his own life? 
Who wrote most of the books of the New Testament? 
Indicate whether in the Old or New Testament: 
Chronicles. 
Corinthians. 
Philippians. 
Ecclesiastes. 
Hebrews. 
Leviticus. 
Name the judge who was responsible for the death of Christ. 
Who was the beloved apostle? 
What book in the New Testament gives the story of the 
doings of the apostles? 
Some of the high school pupils were unable to answer a 
single question correctly and the average for the whole group 
was seven correct answers. It has been pointed out that one 
cannot read English literature understandingly without a con- 
 
-P-A-G-E-623
   CURRICULA AND COURSES OF STUDY 605 
siderable knowledge of the Bible. The statutes of the State 
of Nebraska forbid sectarian instruction in the public schools. 
It is argued that this precludes the possibility of giving a 
course of instruction on the Bible even though it is non-secta- 
rian in character. 
Assignment 
Among the methods which have been proposed for the solu- 
tion of the problem are the following: 
1. That Bible instruction be offered in the upper grades of the 
elementary school and in the high school, and that it be made 
elective and credit given to.those who pass examinations at 
the end of the course. 
2. That a room be set apart in each of four school buildings 
centrally located which may be used by the different denomina- 
tions, children to be excused to attend the instruction given by 
a representative of the church of their parents’ choice. It is 
proposed that credit be given for work undertaken. 
3. That courses in religious education be given in the representa- 
tive church buildings; that the schools dismiss the children 
early on one afternoon a week and be responsible for their 
attendance at the church of their parents’ choice. Credit to be 
given for work done. 
Which, if any, of these proposals would you advocate for the 
Board of Education? 
Give in detail a plan for the development of public opinion 
with respect to the solution of this problem.

PROBLEM 86 
THE COURSE IN HOME ECONOMICS IN AN 
INDUSTRIAL COMMUNITY 
Problem: The city of Janesville is a recently developed indus- 
trial community of 20,000 population. The high school enrols 
750, four hundred of whom are girls. Up to the present time 
the course in home economics so-called has consisted of two 
years’ work in cooking and two years in sewing. There is very 
great dissatisfaction with these courses. They are unpopular 
with the girls in the school. You are asking the teachers en- 
gaged in this field, the high school principal, and teachers from 
certain other related subjects to consider the problem of the 
revision of the curriculum in home economics. 
It is important for the consideration of the group to know 
that 50 per cent of the girls who enter high school leave before 
the end of the sophomore year. They go to work in the fac- 
tories, stores and offices primarily. Of those who remain in 
school to the end approximately 20 per cent go to college, 40 
per cent go into the better paid commercial positions, and 40 
per cent remain at home or are married within a period of five 
years. 
A very vigorous women’s club in the city has asked that the 
offering in the high school be greatly extended. They propose 
that courses in home nursing, in millinery, in household dec- 
oration and in design be added. 
Separate courses in these fields do not seem to you to be 
justified on account of the small number of pupils who might 
reasonably be expected to enrol in any one of them. There 
are other considerations which you will present to the 
committee. 
Assignment 
1. Should a high school course in home economics in the 
community of the sort described consist primarily of special- 
606 
 
-P-A-G-E-625
  CURRICULA AND COURSES OF STUDY 607 
ized courses or in a general introductory course in the field of 
home economics? 
2. What part in such a course would thrift have as applied 
to the choice of clothing and food, the determination of indi- 
vidual and family budgets? 
3. Is it possible to include in such an introductory course 
problems of sanitation and hygiene, both from the standpoint 
of one’s person, the home in which one lives, and the com- 
munity? 
4. How much emphasis should be placed upon the prepara- 
tion of food as compared with the time given to the study of 
menus and the consideration of more common principles of 
dietetics? 
5. How much time should be given to the development of 
skill in sewing as compared with the emphasis placed upon the 
selection of clothing in terms of line, design, and color suitable 
for the person wearing it, durability and the like?

  PROBLEM 87 
“SPECIAL WEEKS” 
Problem: To determine the attitude to be adopted by the 
school toward the observation of “special weeks.” 
The superintendent of schools of Harrison, N. K., has re- 
ceived the following communication from the mayor of the city. 
April 10, 1925 
PROCLAMATION 
“Be Kind to Animals Week” 
Advance in civilization manifests itself in increasing con- 
sideration for the rights and feelings of all living creatures. 
There is a marked tendency towards the elimination of cruelty. 
Much has been accomplished. The effort for further achieve- 
ment should be heartily encouraged. Accordingly, as mayor of 
Harrison, I consider it my duty to call your attention to the 
annual observance of “Be Kind to Animals Week” from April 
13th to April 19th, inclusive. It ends with Humane Sunday, 
April 19th. It is hoped that the day may be fittingly re- 
membered here, and that during the entire week the residents 
of the city, especially children, will give thought to the loyalty, 
devotion and valuable services of our four-footed friends, 
particularly the dog, the horse, and the cat. 
The codperation of the pulpit, the press, the radio, and the 
schools is earnestly requested. It is emphatically urged that 
you devote part of the time of that school week to the teaching 
of children in accord with the spirit of this proclamation. 
Wit11am P. Armstrone, Mayor, 
City of Harrison, N. K. . 
This is one of many proclamations or requests that have 
come to the superintendent during this same year for the 
observation of special weeks. In each case it has been sug- 
gested that a special period be set aside in the schools for the 
instruction of children in the special fields. Among these 
special week notices have been those concerned with fire pre- 
vention, the American forest, good health, music, safety first, 
608 
 
-P-A-G-E-627
CURRICULA AND COURSES OF STUDY 609 
thrift and the like. The superintendent has issued bulletins 
from time to time advocating the program as set forth in the 
proclamation and asking the teachers to codperate. Much 
opposition has arisen among the teachers to these breaks in 
the regular teaching program. The importance of the office 
from which the proclamations come makes the superintendent 
reluctant to pass them by without giving them official notice. 
Assignment 
1. To what degree has the curriculum in the elementary 
school been decided by groups interested in the special phase 
of human activity? 
2. Take the laws of your own state and discover, where pos- 
sible, definite curriculum requirements which have been the 
outcome of campaigns or propaganda. 
8. What effect will constant interruption of the regular in- 
struction have upon the attitudes of teachers and children 
toward an established curriculum? 
4. A frequent criticism of school work is the failure to stress 
the three “R’s” and the tendency to include fads and fancies in 
the curriculum. What bearing has this topic on this problem? 
5. Is it possible that those responsible for “special week” 
proclamations have lost faith in the traditional curriculum? 
Do these proclamations indicate a desire to make the subject- 
matter of the curriculum conform to the life needs of children? 
6. Study the time allotments for the elementary school 
curriculum. Is there any evidence to prove that the time 
allotment can be reduced in any subject? 
7. Should the superintendent of schools be safeguarded 
against the “special week” by a rule of the Board of Educa- 
tion? If you think so, write the appropriate rule.

   PROBLEM 88 
PLACE OF MUSIC IN THE CURRICULA 
Cass I 
Problem: What should be the course of study in music for 
rural schools in order to prepare children for junior and senior 
high school work in a neighboring city? 
In Adams Township a majority of the boys and girls com- 
plete their work in the rural schools at the end of the sixth 
year and go to the neighboring city for their junior and senior 
high school work. The schools in this city have music as a 
required course in the junior high school and the first year in 
the senior high schools. The pupils from the rural schools find 
it difficult to do satisfactory work in these classes because of 
their lack of preparation. The parents of these pupils are 
anxious that the rural schools should give them sufficient 
preparation for the music courses offered in the city schools. 
Assignment 
1. What steps should be taken by the county superintendent 
of schools in the development of a course of study and in the 
teaching and supervision of music? 
2. How should this course of study be developed, and what 
provision should be made for the teaching of music in rural 
schools? : 
Cass IT 
Problem: Music in the junior high school curriculum. 
The City of Adelon, N. K., has just established two junior 
high schools. A supervisor of music proposes that music be 
offered as one of the major subjects in the junior high school 
610          
-P-A-G-E-629
  CURRICULA AND COURSES OF STUDY 611 
program with at least ninety minutes per week of music re- 
quired of all pupils and with electives offered to those who 
desire to specialize in this field. 
Members of the board of education and many teachers in 
the school system are inclined to consider music as of sec- 
ondary importance. They would make music elective and 
provide only chorus work as required of all pupils. You as 
superintendent of schools are inclined to favor the point of 
view advanced by the supervisor of music. What would you 
do about it? 
Assignment 
Draft a report on the place of music in the junior high school 
curriculum for presentation to the board of education. 
Case III 
Problem: The organization of a school orchestra. 
In your community the only music that has been given in 
the schools consists in sight singing and in theory related to 
this type of school music. A number of interested parents and 
the women’s club of your community have proposed the teach- 
ing of instrumental music in the schools. 
Some members of the community have been very much im- 
pressed with the school orchestras and school bands which 
have been organized in near-by cities. You believe that it will 
be to the advantage of the pupils in your school to undertake 
work in this field. 
Assignment 
1. What arguments will you place before your board of 
education that will lead them to favor the development of 
instrumental music in your school system? 
2. What steps will you take to provide musical instruments 
for children whose parents cannot well afford to buy them? 
3. Do you consider it possible to develop a school band 
without having those who secure membership in it receive 
private lessons?

THE SUPERINTENDENT’S ANNUAL REPORT 
Problem: What should be the form and the content of the an- 
nual report of the superintendent of schools? 
The superintendent of schools of Oldsworth, N. K., has pre- 
pared an annual report for the years 1912 to 1923, inclusive. 
The city of Oldsworth, N. K., has a population of 30,000. It 
is situated in the center of a prosperous farming country. The 
city is a trading center and has also seen considerable develop- 
ment as an industrial community. It is a city which has at- 
tracted a considerable number of retired farmers and business 
men for residence. The wealth per capita is high as compared 
with other cities of its class in the state. The industries are 
sufficiently varied to have attracted an equal proportion of 
skilled and unskilled workers. 
The school organization in 1924 was as follows:

  FARM SCHOOL 
(Purcoasep Novemser 1, 1912) 
«._, the policy should be to make the Farm School an elementary 
school of ‘agriculture. 
. . a school of this character is absolutely essential in the 
enforcement of the com ulsory education law. . 
“Tt should be the policy of the school to plant some fruit trees each 
year and to increase the size of the dairy.” 
. . . Tecommend that such an additional teacher (graduate, of 
recognized agricultural college) be employed for the coming year.’ 
“., . for the proper carrying out of such a plan we really need 
more land as noted above.” 
States that electric lighting and addition to building is needed. 
- recommend that a reading room be provided . . . and 
question of enlarging of school be given careful consideration.” 
Recommends additional fire protection and better water supply 
be provided for the farm school. 
. . that the much needed improvements at the Farm School 
be provided. re. 
Recommends a number of improvements for Farm School requested 
by State Board of Charities. 
HEALTH AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION 
“School nurse . . . and trust that it will be possible to make this 
one, of the regular features of the work of the schools.” 
. . an inspection (dental) shduld be made of all schools at 
the begining of each term.” 
“We have made . . . a beginning along the right lines . . 
continued attention should accomplish much for the welfare of the 
children. (Referring to medical inspection.) 
Recommends that greater attention be paid to dental work. 
Points out “need of a more systematic plan”’ for dental work. 
Recommends $1,000 for provision of dental assistant. (Dentist 
gave services up to this time.) 
. . means for medical treatment of children whose parents are

PROBLEM 91 
REPORTING TO A BOARD OF EDUCATION 
Problem: In the city of Three Rivers, N. K., the Board of Ed- 
ucation consists of nine members, seven of whom have recently 
been replaced by new members because of resignations and 
recent spring elections to office. The superintendent is con- 
fronted with the problem of giving the Board of Education 
adequate information concerning the work which has been 
done in the schools. The school board meetings have become 
extremely long, sometimes running past the midnight hour. 
Much time is taken in discussing details of problems which 
the superintendent thought might be presented to the Board 
in other ways. He has recently developed a system of report- 
ing to the Board of Education, preparatory to each regular 
meeting of the Board. This report, of which the following is a 
sample, is mailed to each member two or three days before 
each meeting.

I am pleased to hand you herewith the following report prepara- 
tory to your meeting next Monday evening, October 27, 1924. 
B. C. Brown, Superintendent. 
Opening of School 
School opened on schedule time with a full faculty with the 
exception of the nurse. No time was lost in getting started. Every- 
body seems to be happy and to have taken hold with a will. Every- 
thing was running smoothly the first day. Special credit is due Mr. 
Bye for the manner in which the high school got under way for the 
year’s work. 
The superintendent spent a very profitable summer at the Eastern 
University where he pursued the major course for city superin- 
tendents. He came back with new enthusiasm and with new and 
additional ideas and knowledge which he hopes will redound to the 
increased efficiency and usefulness of our schools. He hereby

acknowledges with hearty thanks the action of the Board which 
made it possible for him to attend. 
Attendance 
The table below sets forth our enrolment at the end of the first 
week as well as similar data for the preceding three years. Though 
no check has as yet been made on the absence in the grades, a 
relatively large number has as yet evidently not enrolled. A canvass 
is being made this week, however, to gather up the stragglers and 
to discover who have moved away. In the grades, you will notice 
there are fifty-two less while in high school there are fifty-two more 
pupils than we had at the corresponding time last year making the

education.

The table below compares teachers’ salaries for the last five 
years, including this year’s pay roll without substitutes: 
Year Salaries Enrolment 
1920-1921 $75,111.06 1,540 
1921-1922 70,044.95 1,585 
1922-1923 70,228.30 1,660 
1923-1924 64,481.81 1,532 
1924-1925 67,012.50 . 
Sick Leave and Visiting Day 
Again, I would like to recommend that the Board continue its 
commendable and progressive practise of allowing teachers ten 
days’ sick leave with pay and one visiting day. Table XIII of my 
last year’s annual report gives a complete account of teacher 
absence for 1923-1924. 
Tuition 
High School. Except for pupils living outside the state, of whom 
so far we have one, and for pupils living in high school districts 
in the state, of whom we have none, so far as I have thus far been 
able to discover, the state reimburses our district for each non- 
resident to the extent of $7.00 a month or major fraction thereof. 
For the past year, we are entitled to $8,344.00 for tuition. Does 
the Board wish to charge tuition for such pupils as are not paid 
for by the state? 
Grades. The Board has not been charging tuition for non- 
resident grade pupils the past several years. The principal reasons, 
as I have understood them, are, first, the fact that they have not 
been so numerous as to congest our grades (Last year there were 
seventeen) ; second, most of the non-residents are poor and can ill
-P-A-G-E-649
     RECORDS AND REPORTS 631 
afford to pay a personal tuition; third, they are a part of the com- 
munity while here, they buy or earn their bread and keep from 
residents; and, finally, any school district can better afford to 
educate children than to allow them to go uneducated. I see no 
reason why the number of non-residents should vary to any material 
extent. 
Grade Texts 
In accordance with the instructions of the Board or its committee 
to buy texts in arithmetic, history and geography for the grades, I 
wish to present for formal approval the following specific texts 
which have been purchased: 
Horn’s Learn to Study Readers (Supplementary)...... Ginn 
Stone-Millis Arithmetic Series (Revised).............. Sanborn 
Halleck’s History of Our Country (for 8th grade)...... American 
J. Russell Smith Human Geography, Book I, Parts I & II 
A BF eos cach ces Cah eka kG ees Macmillan 
Intermediate Music (for fifth grade)................. Ginn 
Further immediate needs are: 
1. Additional readers to replace worn-out and out-of-date books 
now in use (all grades) 
2. One hundred B & McF Sec. Book in Geography to replace 1914 
edition of the same text (seventh grade) 
3. B & McF Geog. Sec. Bk., Part I, to replace worn-out and 1914 
edition of the same text (sixth grade) 
4. A complete new set (130-140) histories for sixth grade to re- 
place the worn-out Woodburn-Moran, Introduction to Ameri- 
can History ’ 
5. A geography text (130-140) for third grade 
6. Miscellaneous texts to replace worn-out copies of books in use 
7. A certain sum of money, say $50, set aside out of the text- 
book allowance for approved standardized tests. 
To date grade texts have been purchased to the amount of $309.46 
exclusive of music books which have not yet arrived. The total 
for the year ought not to exceed $1,000 as set forth in the budget. 
At the same time, this amount ought to be spent. 
Religious Instruction 
Formal approval by the Board, in accordance with the law, 
ought to be made of the request of the local churches to excuse 
children for the purposes of religious instruction for a period not 
to exceed three hours a week.

632 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
N.K.E.LA. 
The N. K. Educational Association has voted to hold its conven- 
tion in Three Rivers on December 6th, 7th and 8th. Will the Board 
authorize the superintendent to make such adjustment of the school 
program as will best fit in with the convention program? 
Rent of School Land 
The Board is hereby reminded of making definite disposition of 
Mr. Mason’s application to rent school land south of the city for 
~ the year 1925. 
The 1924 School Census 
In view of Miss Dow’s absence during the summer, the census 
has not yet been taken. It should be completed by November Ist. 
I should like to recommend the initiation of the modern so-called 
“Permanent Continuing Census.”’ The cost would be very nominal, 
and after once established would be a really usable instrument, and 
something which the present document certainly is not! Help 
will be needed regardless of the system of forms used. 
Home Economics 
Because of the unusually large high school enrolment and the 
consequent congestion of the home economics department, it is 
recommended that the room in School No. 1, formerly used for the 
kindergarten, be fitted up for the seventh grade girls in sewing. It 
would involve the purchase of some kind of a sewing machine. A 
second-hand one would do. 
The Manton Service System 
Shall we authorize the Manton Service System to send an in- 
spector to go over our system again this fall? 
Annual Report 
The Superintendent’s Annual Report for 1923-1924 will be given 
out Monday evening. 
Transportation 
Mr. Kelley’s contract and bond ought to be taken care of. 
A Renewed Request (with due apology) 
In view of the fact that the senior funds have been used up and 
are not available for the proposed purchase of filing cabinets for the 
library and for the commercial department, I wish to mention again 
the great need for them. The one requested for the commercial 
department would serve the double purpose, first, of giving the
-P-A-G-E-651
  RECORDS AND REPORTS 633 
students experience in filing, and second, of filing the great number 
of papers that daily accumulate in this department. The file in the 
library would be for the purpose of filing and making accessible and 
usable all manner of pamphlets, articles, clippings, ete. 
The 1924-1925 Budget 
If possible, the budget which is submitted in my annual report 
ought to be gone over carefully and finally approved and adopted. 
Probably a special meeting would be the best way to take care of it. 
A Detailed Analysis of State Aid (See my last Annual Report, 
Tables XXII and XXX) 
By special request, I herewith wish to analyze briefly the system 
of state aid by which our school district is benefited: 
I. Income from permanent school fund, distributed semi- 
annually on apportionment basis (see my Annual Report for 
1923-1924, Table III—B-C) and amounting to about $6.00 
or $6.50 per apportionment pupil annually. Last year we 
received for the previous year $10,250.50. 
II. The state one mill tax distributed as above. (Last year 
our share was $1,693.20.) 
III. Special aids from sums appropriated by the legislature: 
1. To assist in establishing minimum standards: 
a. For each graded elementary school, $300. (We qualify 
for $300 for each of Schools Nos. 2, 4 and 5, or a total 
of $900.) 
b. For each four year high school, $1,000, for which we 
also qualify. 
2. To equalize educational opportunity: 
a. For transportation in consolidated districts. (Last 
year we received $679 for the previous year and we 
we are entitled this year to $696 for last year.) 
. For tuition for non-resident high school pupils in the 
sum of $7.00 a month. (Last year we received 
$7,406.00 for the previous year and this year we are 
entitled to $8,344 for last year.) 
For library aid, half of money spent for this purpose 
up to $40 for each building. (Last year we received 
$166.50 for the previous year and we are entitled this 
year to $195.28 for last year.) 
3. To assist school districts with high tax levy (Supple- 
mental Aid): When a 20 mill levy does not raise $40 per 
apportionment pupil, the state will pay an amount which, o 2°
-P-A-G-E-652
ee Caesar ae 
634 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
together with the proceeds from a 20 mill levy, will give 
each district the equivalent of $40 for each such child. 
To illustrate: Last year, our assessed valuation was 
$1,759,806. A twenty mill levy would therefore raise 
$35,196.12. Since we had 1,459 apportionment pupils 
(See Table III—B-C) this sum would raise for each 
child $35,196.12 divided by 1,459 or approximately $24.12. 
The sum to be made up by way of supplemental aid for 
each child, therefore, would be the difference between 
$40 and $24.12 or approximately $15.88. The total 
supplemental aid would be 1,459 & $15.88, or $23,168.92. 
A shorter, easier, and more exact way of figuring—for it 
would avoid the fraction of the cent—would be 
1,459 children @ $40...... $58,360.00 
20 mill levy on $1,759,806.. 35,196.12 
To be made up by state.... $23,163.88 
However, the law provides for pro rating in case of 
deficit. Last year, we received for the previous year 
$14,392.68 which was 53% of the full amount due. Fifty 
per cent of the amount due us this year for last year 
would be $11,581.94. 
To stimulate educational progress: 
a. For general industrial training $500 which we have 
received and for which we are continuing to qualify. 
b. For home economics $500 for which we continue to 
qualify. 
c. For commercial training $500 for which we continue 
to qualify. 
(Under heading “4” above, I again wish to recommend 
the establishment at the earliest possible date of an 
opportunity room or opportunity rooms for slow chil- 
dren for which state aid is allowed in the sum of $100 
per pupil per year.) 
To aid teacher training departments: (Briefly) 
a. Full salary of teachers in accordance with schedule 
(This year Miss Langworthy $1900 and Miss Bailor 
$1700). 
b. Textbooks, up to $50 for two-teacher department. 
c. Library and magazines, up to $70 including a maximum 
of $15 for magazines for two-teacher department. 
d. Furniture and equipment, up to $100 for two-teacher 
department. 
e. Construction and industrial materials, up to $80 for 
two-teacher department.   
= o
-P-A-G-E-653
RECORDS AND REPORTS 635 
f. Transportation: 
a. For railroad fare and not to exceed $15 for hotel 
for each training teacher to annual conference. 
b. For approved work in rural schools and for visiting 
other department, up to $50 for each of two 
teachers. 
c. For special conferences called by inspector, expenses. 
d. For pupils visiting rural schools for observation, up 
to $60 for two-teacher department. 
Note: Rules and regulations govern each of the above items. The 
most satisfactory disposition for the Board to make would be to 
authorize the superintendent, after consultation, and with the 
advice of the head of the teacher training department, to make suit- 
able expenditures within the limits of state reimbursement.

        PROBLEM 92 
MARKING SYSTEM FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS 
AND FORM OF REPORT TO BE MADE 
TO PARENTS 
Problem: Six months ago you were elected superintendent of 
schools in Westmar, N. K. Among the problems which have 
developed during this first year of your administration is that 
of a system of marking pupils and the form of report to be 
sent to parents. 
The issue of the marking system has arisen in relation to 
standardized tests which you have had given in grades four 
to eight, inclusive. In the light of the intelligence quotients 
derived and the scores in the several tests given you have 
brought about a reclassification of pupils in each of the five 
elementary schools. This new classification seeks to place 
children, in so far as it is possible, in homogeneous groups. In 
each of the buildings you have been able to organize three 
classes in each grade. 
The teachers have been very much concerned about the type 
of mark to be given. Under the former system of classification 
they reported grades on the basis of 100 per cent for the pupil 
doing the best work and all of the marks below 70 were con- 
sidered failures. The teachers now suggest that in the lower 
group they have relatively few children who deserve a passing 
mark, if they adhere to their old standards. They raise the 
question of the validity of a mark in one section of the class 
that represents something entirely different from the same 
mark in another section of the same grade. 
Some of the more thoughtful teachers are inquiring con- 
cerning the desirability of giving marks other than those 
which measure achievement in the school subjects. They have 
suggested that children be marked for good citizenship, for the 
industry which they show in their work, in the degree of lead- 
ership which they have developed in the group, and the like. 
638
-P-A-G-E-657
  RECORDS AND REPORTS 639 
Parents have been very much aroused because of the tend- 
ency by both teachers and pupils to characterize the lower 
groups in a fashion that indicates the inferiority of the chil- 
dren so placed. 
Among some of the proposals that have been made are the 
following: 
1. Marks should be given in terms of the variation of the in- 
dividual’s achievement from the central tendency of the group of 
which he is a member. 
2. A mark of “A” or of 90 per cent should mean the same in all 
sections, that is, the mark should record accurately the achievement 
of the individual in the particular work reported upon. 
3. Two marks should be given—one designating the place in the 
group to which the individual is entitled by his achievement, and 
another that would indicate the section of the whole group to which 
he belonged. 
Assignment 
How would you meet this situation? 
Propose the type of conference which you would undertake 
with principals and teachers with respect to marking. 
Prepare the discussion on marking which you would have 
mimeographed and placed in the hands of each member of the 
group in preparation for the conference which you plan to 
hold.

PROBLEM 93 
INTERSCHOLASTIC ATHLETICS 
Problem: Interscholastic athletics, especially football and bas- 
ketball, have come to occupy a most important place in the 
life of high school students in your city. The development of 
winning teams under a competent coach has led to great in- 
terest on the part of the people of the small city, 5,000 popula- 
tion, in which you are superintendent of schools. The football 
team has won a state championship, the basketball team a 
so-called national championship. The high school is becom- 
ing completely demoralized because of the attention to ath- 
letics to the exclusion of every other type of activity. 
The problem proposed above has developed gradually during 
the period of the past five years. Seven years ago a new high 
school building was constructed with a large gymnasium con- 
taining space enough for a basketball court and seats in the 
gallery and on the floor for 1,000, and an athletic field on the 
grounds was provided with bleachers to accommodate 2,500. 
The coach engaged has proved most successful in winning 
games. He is the most popular man in town. He receives as 
a stated salary from the Board of Education as much as the 
high school principal and only $500 less than the superintend- 
ent of schools. It is well established that he receives by way 
of private gifts an amount that makes his income considerably 
larger than that received by the superintendent of schools. 
The influence of the coach on the boys of the high school has 
not been good. He has taught them to win at any price. Be- 
cause of the success of the teams that he has coached many 
boys remain in high school who do most inferior work. Social 
pressure is brought to bear on teachers to give them a passing 
mark so that they may qualify for the team. Many of these 
athletes are 19 to 21 years of age. 
As superintendent you feel responsible for the condition 
which has risen and hope to correct it. Your Board is divided. 
Two of the five members have sons who are stars on the foot- 
ball team. Two other members feel that much worth-while

advertising and not a little business has been brought to the 
town by virtue of the successful teams that have been turned 
out. All members of the Board fear to antagonize the public. 
Assignment 
1. Prepare a statement of the principles which should gov- 
ern in the development of a program of physical education 
including the place of interscholastic athletics. Prepare your 
statement in such form as you think appropriate to present to 
the Board of Education for their consideration. 
2. What program would you present to the Board of Educa- 
tion for their action seeking to modify the present situation? 
3. Prepare newspaper abstract of speech which you plan to 
give to the most important men’s luncheon group in the city 
with respect to needed reforms in athletics in the high school.

PROBLEM 94 
FINANCING ATHLETICS IN A SCHOOL SYSTEM 
Problem: To ascertain the financial responsibility of the 
Board of Education in the development of the athletic pro- 
gram. 
1. The high school of Macden, N. K., for a period of years, 
had experienced difficulties in financing its athletic program. 
At the end of the year 1923-1924, the superintendent, the high 
school principal and the athletic director signed a note for $250 
for money with which to meet the obligations of the High 
School Athletic Association. This money was returned at the 
end of the football season. 
Question: Was this a proper responsibility for these officers 
to assume? 
2. The athletic director of the high school at Kilroy, N. K., 
a city of 35,000 people, was the principal selling-agent for ad- 
missions to all athletic contests. At the middle of the school 
year of 1924-25, the superintendent asked for an audit of the 
accounts in the hands of the director. The director took the 
request as a reflection upon his honesty and integrity. The 
student body, with which he was popular, took a similar at- 
titude and the matter was heatedly discussed by all students 
The result, after three days of suspense, was the assertion by 
the director that he would resign. Eighty per cent of the 
student body declared a strike and walked out of school. 
Question: Did the superintendent of schools overstep his 
authority in this field of finance? 
3. In the fall of 1925, the Athletic Association of the 
Gwynns Falls High School was without funds. The principal, 
after advising with the superintendent and members of his 
faculty, decided to ask each pupil to pay a membership fee of 
645
-P-A-G-E-664
  646 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
fifty cents twice each year. The payment of the fee was not 
compulsory but the matter was put in such a way that nearly 
all pupils paid, including the children of the seventh and 
eighth grades who occupied a part of the building. 
Question: Are there implications in this form of compul- 
sion which might result disastrously if carried further? 
4. In the town of Saltsburg, N. K., the girls of the high 
school wished to organize a girls’ basketball team. There were 
no funds available for equipment, so they petitioned the su- 
perintendent of schools to allow them, upon a certain desig- 
nated evening, to sell, in the gymnasium, pies, cakes, candy, 
sandwiches and the like. He acceded to their request and 
upon the evening designated, the money for equipment was 
raised. The high school girls furnished the entertainment to 
attract the public to the sale, furnished everything sold and 
conducted the sale. A woman member of the high school 
faculty became coach and manager of the team. Difficulties 
arose concerning the use of the fund. 
Question: Whose is the major responsibility? 
5. Basketball is the most important branch of athletics in 
the Jefferson High School. Both boys’ and girls’ teams are 
organized and represent the school in interscholastic contests. 
The boys’ team has been extremely successful over a period of 
years and the athletic association has accumulated a fund of 
$4,000 from the games played in the high school gymnasium. 
No charge has been made by the Board of Education for 
lighting, heating and maintenance of the gymnasium. 
Question: What should be done ultimately with the funds 
which accumulate from this source? Who should have con- 
trol of these funds? 
6. A city of 7,000 has a high school enrolment of approxi- 
mately 550 pupils. The city superintendent has been in his 
position for 14 years and has continued the management of 
athletics which he began when the community and school were 
smaller. The particular service rendered by the superintend-
-P-A-G-E-665
EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 647 
ent has been that of handling the sale of tickets for athletic 
games and contests and acting as athletic manager. It has 
been the policy of the superintendent to make athletics pay 
its way without any money from the tax budget. At the 
end of each season the athletic account usually showed all 
debts paid and a balance on hand of about $300. 
The superintendent had boys help him in the sale of tickets, 
but he had complete charge of all receipts, tickets, ete. There 
was no pretense at checking money or tickets. The superin- 
tendent made a financial statement following each game where 
money was received, which showed the amount received, the 
amount paid out, and the gain or loss entailed. These state- 
ments were occasionally posted on the bulletin board at school 
and at rare intervals got into the city paper. At the end of 
each school year, a more or less detailed statement of the 
athletic account was published. 
Question: What principles of administration were violated 
by this superintendent? 
7. A committee of 25 citizens of Versailles, a city of 4,000 
population, pledged themselves each year to pay any out- 
standing indebtedness at the end of the football season. From 
time to time, the members of this committee have been re- 
quired to pay from $15 to $20 each to make up the deficit. 
In return they have participated in the selection of the coach, 
in the determination of the schedule and even in the naming 
of players much to the embarrassment of the high school prin- 
cipal and the superintendent of schools. During the past 
season, this group became incensed because of the enforcement 
of the scholarship rule in the case of an exceptional football 
player and have withdrawn their support. 
Question: As superintendent of schools, what program 
would you expect to follow henceforth with respect to high 
school football management? 
8. The Manton High School boys, in order to raise money 
to support their athletic teams, opened a lunch store with the 
permission of the principal of the school. Sandwiches, candy,
-P-A-G-E-666
  648 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
etc., were sold to the students of the school during the morning 
and noon lunch periods. All profits of the store were placed 
in an athletic fund to be used to purchase athletic supplies for 
the whole school. The store was operated and managed by 
three of the high school boys working under the jurisdiction of 
the principal and paid for their services at the rate of 25 cents 
per hour. The principal paid little attention to the store, 
turning its management over almost entirely to the boys. 
Things seemed to move along splendidly until a mother com- 
plained to the Board of Education that—(1) the food sold 
was unfit to eat; (2) that the principal did not exercise proper 
supervision over the store; and (3) that the finances of the 
store were not properly handled. 
Question: What is your responsibility as a superintendent 
of schools in a situation like this? 
9. In Avondale, a city of 35,000, the high school football 
program has been strongly supported by the citizens. As 
much as $5,000 has been taken in as receipts from one single 
football game. A large football field was purchased recently 
by the Board of Education and prepared for play and equipped 
with stands and locker rooms out of a part of a bond issue re- 
cently voted by the people. The high school principal, as 
treasurer of the athletic funds, disperses this money at his own 
discretion and according to the desires of the athletic coach. 
The high school principal and the coach have taken the atti- 
tude that the money secured out of these athletic contests 
should be spent in maintaining the interest of the boys in ath- 
letics. Hence, hundreds of dollars have been lavished on the 
members of teams to pay for banquets and for athletic cloth- 
ing. The clothing is donated to the students and consists of 
sweaters, blankets, hats, raincoats and the like. The superin- 
tendent of schools has vigorously opposed such expenditure of 
money and has maintained that the money should go to defray 
the additional expenses incurred by the Board of Education in 
providing a coach and maintaining the field. 
Question: What is the principle involved in the control of 
this fund?

PROBLEM 95 
AUXILIARY SCHOOL FUNDS * 
Problem: In many school systems funds not provided for by 
law, such as student activity funds, school savings, class funds, 
and lunch room funds, are accumulated in the school system. 
What provision should be made for their administration? 
Case No. 1 
A city of 60,000 with a business manager responsible directly 
to the Board of Education. Schools organized on 6-3-3 plan 
with appropriate grades of shop, industrial, vocational and 
household arts work on each of the three levels in all schools 
in the city. The purchase and sale to students of working 
materials and supplies such as lumber, metal, cloth and the 
like in small quantities resulted in an embarrassing number of 
transactions to be passed upon by the Board when such trans- 
actions were carried out in the usual manner of purchase and 
sale by the Board. 
The business manager set up a “revolving fund” out of 
school moneys (not authorized under the law) and carried on 
such purchase and sale without annoyance to the Board. The 
amount of this revolving fund varied from time to time reach- 
ing in some instances as much as $40,000. The funds accounts 
were not audited, the state law not legalizing the expenditure 
of school funds by the Board of Education for audit purposes. 
Through a series of suspected forgeries in connection with 
the purchase of school sites, the business manager was charged 
by a group of citizens with irregularities in his accounts. The 
Board of Education in response to popular demand promised a 
thorough audit but were confronted with the legal restriction 
that they could not pay for such an audit. The office of the 
district attorney was appealed to and an audit was instituted 
* Auxiliary school funds are here defined as funds not provided for by law, 
such as student activity funds, school savings, class funds, revolving funds, etc. 
650

EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 651 
under his directions. The audit revealed two $5,000 forgeries 
and in addition numerous and considerable irregularities in 
the account of the “revolving fund.” 
The business manager is in jail pending trial on forgery and 
embezzlement with admitted certainty of conviction. His 
personal assets were attached by the authorities but in all are 
far short of the deficits in the accounts of the Board of Educa- 
tion. He was not under bond. 
Assignment 
1. In view of the fact that the business manager was respon- 
sible directly to the Board of Education, what attitude would 
you, as superintendent of schools, have taken toward this 
affair? (a) Before any irregularity was suspected? (b) After 
charges of irregularity were sustained by the audit of accounts? 
2. Is it likely that such a situation would have arisen if the 
business manager had been responsible to the superintendent 
of schools? 
3. Would you, as superintendent of schools, sanction the use 
of a “revolving fund” for purposes such as above described? 
If so, under what conditions? If not, how would you provide 
for the handling of such accounts? 
4. Should a business manager be required to give bond for 
the safe-keeping of all funds handled by him? If so, by whom 
paid? 
5. Will you, as a superintendent of schools, allow yourself 
to be caught in the back-wash of a situation of this kind? Just 
what precautions will you take to safeguard yourself and the 
school system? 
Cass No. 2 
A city of 300,000 population, with a progressive school sys- 
tem. During the war, practically all of the individual schools 
in the city had raised funds through “paper drives,” plays, 
school games and the like and had invested those funds in 
Liberty Bonds. The money having been raised by the com- 
bined efforts of the pupils in the schools, the bonds were re- 
garded as belonging to the particular school in which they 
were bought. It was understood that the proceeds of the bonds 
would be used to purchase for the school such things as could 
   
-P-A-G-E-670
652 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
not be purchased legally from public funds or such things as 
they wanted that the Board of Education could not afford to 
approve. 
In buildings where a school vault was provided, the bonds 
were placed in the vault for safe-keeping. In certain of the 
other schools, the bonds were placed in a safety deposit box in 
a bank. The Board of Education sent out a notice to all of 
the schools to the effect that they would provide safe-keeping 
of the bonds for all schools desiring to avail themselves of it. 
A number of schools sent their bonds in to the central office 
where a record was made with the clerk of the Board and the 
bonds deposited in the vault. 
In the course of the two or three years immediately follow- 
ing the war, some of the schools sold their bonds and bought 
various articles for their school equipment, such as pianos, 
band instruments, uniforms, victrolas and the like, in most 
cases, the transactions being carried on, checks signed, deposits 
made and the like by the officers of the student body. 
In the meantime, a school building bond campaign was 
launched in the city and a rather heavy publicity program was 
undertaken with a consequent financial obligation running into 
several thousands of dollars. After such obligations had been 
assumed, the District Attorney ruled that publicity bills could 
not be paid out of school funds. 
These bills had to be met. Various means of raising the 
money were proposed; among them the suggestion that since 
the schools had in their possession Liberty Bonds, the ultimate 
purpose of which was to purchase certain needed equipment 
for the school, it would be entirely proper and lawful for the 
several schools to contribute their bonds toward the payment 
of the publicity deficit providing the Board of Education would 
in turn approve warrants for desired equipment in each school 
to the amount of their contribution in bonds. The proposition 
was discussed in a conference of school principals with school 
officials. It was agreed that while such a procedure might be 
within the law, the ethics in the case were doubtful. The 
proposal was dropped and the deficits on the publicity account 
made up by private subscription. 
Three years later, and less than a week before a school board 
election at which a minority of the Board and an anti-admin-
-P-A-G-E-671
  
EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 653 
istrative group in the city calculated to gain control of the 
Board, charges were publicly made by the minority members 
of the Board that the superintendent of schools had been a 
party to and responsible for the “misapplication of money be- 
longing to the little children of the city.” The charge had its 
origin in the suggested disposition of the Liberty Bonds. 
The superintendent demanded an immediate public hear- 
ing. The majority of the Board agreed to an immediate 
hearing, the minority urged delay. The hearing was set for 
the day next following the day on which the charges were 
made. Both sides were represented by legal counsel and for 
three days a hearing equivalent to a public trial for embezzle- 
ment was directed at the superintendent. 
The hearing resulting in a complete vindication of the su- 
perintendent was brought to a conclusion on the day before 
the Board election, with the result that the popular vote on 
the following day was an overwhelming expression of con- 
fidence in the superintendent and the majority of the Board 
of Education. Had the minority members of the Board with- 
held their charges two days or even one day, there is little 
doubt but what the control of the Board would have been 
reversed and the administration overturned. 
Assignment 
1. To what degree should the Board of Education of a city, 
through its executive head, exercise control over auxiliary 
funds in the several schools; re: methods of raising? means of 
safe-keeping? methods and authorization of expenditure? 
2. Lay out a practical plan of administrative control over 
auxiliary funds that, in your judgment, will protect the school 
system against such potential hazards as above described, and 
at the same time not restrict the activities of the individual 
schools to such a point as to destroy a desirable degree of in- 
itiative. This plan should be complete from the regulations 
to be incorporated in the rules and regulations of the Board 
of Education to the steps in administrative procedure through 
which every transaction should go.

  PROBLEM 96 
EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
Problem: As superintendent of schools in the city of Atwood, 
you have discovered many defects in the nature and manage- 
ment of the high school student activity program. After care- 
ful study, you have decided upon the appointment of a student 
activities committee whose task it shall be to survey the local 
program and make a series of recommendations for improve- 
ment. The committee is composed of five representative 
faculty members and the principal of the high school ex 
officio. What will you do with the report which follows? 
Faculty-Student Activities Committee 
This committee shall have general control and supervision of all 
clubs, classes, and similar student activities, subject only to the 
approval of the principal. All student clubs, societies, and organiza- 
tions in the school shall be approved and chartered by this com- 
mittee, and their constitutions and by-laws be submitted to it for 
approval before becoming effective. 
This committee shall also cause to be formulated and put into 
effect a school policy or plan for the handling and auditing of the 
financial affairs of all organizations coming under its control, in 
order that a wise check may be placed upon expenditures, and a 
proper accounting made. 
This committee shall consist of the principal as chairman, two 
women teachers, and two men teachers. Members shall be ap- 
pointed by the principal to serve at his discretion, and shall not be 
advisers of any student organization, or members of the Student 
Council Faculty Committee. 
Faculty Sponsors 
All students clubs and organizations of whatever kind shall have 
one official faculty sponsor appointed by the principal to serve at 
his discretion, acting under the general direction of the Faculty 
Student Activities Committee. The duties of these sponsors shall 
be similar to those outlined for Faculty Adviser of Student Council. 
654
-P-A-G-E-673
   EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
Equal Distribution of the Teacher’s Load 
A point system shall be worked out and used so that the re- 
sponsibilities assigned to various teachers will be equalized. By 
this system, a class taught every day in the week might be weighted 
as worth 5 points, one taught three days, 3 points, etc. Regular 
after-school coaching 4% point per hour per day, regular class 
sponsorship 14 point per day, etc. Thus by giving a value to all 
regular and extra-school activities, the administration may equalize 
the assigned burden upon all teachers. More extra-school work 
will mean less regular schedule work, and vice versa. 655 
Home Rooms 
The home room period shall be extended as suggested under the 
heading “Time Schedule.” The home room should be made a 
potent, live factor in the conduct of the school. Each home room 
teacher should become a school mother or father to the pupils in 
that room, giving them individual help and personal study. Home 
conditions; pupil mental, moral, and physical characteristics; voca- 
tional aptitudes and needs; educational guidance; everything that 
concerns the welfare of the individual, should be studied and looked 
after. There is no opportunity a high school has which is bigger 
than this; no field more worthy of sincere, earnest effort. The 
example, friendship, and advice of a worthy teacher usually far 
outlast any other impression the pupil carries into life with him. 
In order to accomplish this work, the home room groups must 
be made as small as possible. To this end, every teacher in the 
school should be assigned to home room duty, including those in 
physical education and the laboratory and commercial subjects. A 
share in the home room responsibilities will be an excellent thing 
for these teachers who have never participated. They will gain a 
broader appreciation of the schools as a whole, while bringing to 
it a point of view which is very much needed. Where it is neces- 
sary to seat 60 pupils in a room, two teachers should be assigned, 
each to have her own group of 30 for individual attention and ad- 
vising. These two should alternate in conducting the general 
exercises, such as the reading of the Bible and the notices. 
Home room teachers should retain their groups intact from 
semester to semester over a reasonable period of time, subject to 
individual changes because of incompatibility. 
An effective home room organization will result in a much more 
effective school. It will tend to lessen the elimination of dis- 
couraged pupils, and to hearten the work of those remaining.        
-P-A-G-E-674
  656 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
Time Schedule 
That the present time program be rearranged to provide for a six- 
period day, with 14 minutes in the home room at the beginning 
of the day. The third period in the day to be a study-consultation 
period for all pupils and teachers. 
Such a program will operate somewhat as follows, and has the 
advantage of providing a longer home room period with an oppor- 
tunity for the teacher to know her pupils better, and an intermediate 
period for study-consultatién at a time when the pupils will be the 
most likely to use it. It does not change the net amount of time in 
school, the length of the recitations, or the hours on duty for the 
teachers, but gains the needed time for an adequate home room 
period by dispensing with the useless, repeated passing back to the 
home rooms during the day. Teachers record the attendance in 
each recitation anyway, pupils can readily return to the home 
rooms for needed books during the regular between-periods inter- 
vals of 3 minutes, and it is just as easy for the office to find a pupil 
in a recitation room as in a home room. Moreover, the health of 
the child, particularly that of girls, dictates as little stair-climbing 
as possible.

Debating and Dramatics 
These subjects shall be a part of the regular school program, time 
to be assigned to them upon the regular schedule, the same as to 
English or mathematics. They shall be taught by teachers having 
specific training and experience for them, rather than by those 
whose primary interests lie along other lines. Such teachers shall 
then be assisted in times of need by other members of the faculty 
who are interested in debating or dramatics as avocations. 
English Classes and “The Alpha” 
There shall be a special committee of the faculty appointed to 
consider the question of better correlation in the matter of con- 
tributions between work in the English classes and “The Alpha.”

Mathematics Club 
Requirements for membership in this Club shall call for the 
completion of two years of high school work in mathematics 
previous to admission, regardless of scholastic standing, with the 
exception—that any pupil having less than two years of work shall 
be eligible upon the written recommendation of a member of the 
faculty of the mathematics department. 
Student Council 
The present Student Council is not directly representative of the 
school as a whole, and does not function in student self-government 
as it should. As now constituted, it is somewhat of a cabinet of 
class officers presided over by the principal of the school, and 
utilized in a more or less perfunctory way. It should be reorganized 
to be truly representative of the general student body, and the 
various minor clubs and groups. It should be invested with 
sufficient authority and prestige to become a real factor in self- 
government. To accomplish this requires the delegation of re- 
sponsibility without the yielding of faculty control. 
In the form of organization herewith suggested, comprehensive 
student representation is obtained by direct election of a certain 
proportion of the Student Council members; responsibility is pro- 
moted by permitting the Council to elect its own officers and con- 
duct its own meetings; while faculty control is retained by mak- 
ing it necessary for all recommendations passed by the Council to 
be approved by the Student Council Faculty Committee. 
Purposes or THE Srupent Councin 
The purposes of the Student Council shall be:—(a) To make such recom- 
mendations to the Faculty Committee as it believes to be for the good of 
the student body as a whole. (b) To assist the principal and faculty in build- 
ing up a maximum of responsible student participation in the government 
and activities of the school. (c) To stand for democracy, fair-play, and 
courtesy among the students, and to promote the welfare of the school above 
the selfish interests of individuals. 
Form or ORGANIZATION 
Membership 
The membership shall consist of two officers from each class—the president 
and secretary, one representative each from the “Alpha,” the Debating 
Society, the R. O. T. C., the Dramatic Club, the Boys’ Glee Clubs, the Girls’ 
Glee Clubs, the Band and Orchestra combined, and one boy and one girl 
from the Athletic Council making a total of 25; and, in addition, 10 
members to be elected at large from the school, not more than 6 of whom 
shall be juniors or seniors. Grand total of Student Council membership, 35.

  658 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
Eligibility 
Members of the Student Council shall be passing in 12 points of their 
school work, this ruling to apply to the quarterly ranking period (10 weeks) 
preceding election. 
Certification 
All nominations for election to the Student Council shall be approved by 
the Faculty Student Council Committee before elections are held. The 
nominations shall be made by a written petition for each candidate nominated, 
each petition to carry the signatures of not less than 25 students in good 
standing. i 
Officers 
The officers of the Student Council shall consist of a President, Vice 
President, Secretary, and Treasurer, to be elected by the Council. They 
shall be elected from one school year, vacancies to be filled by the Council 
at the time of their occurrence. The President and Vice President shall be 
members of the classes 5 to 8 inclusive, i.e., juniors or seniors. 
Faculty Adviser 
There shall be a Faculty Student Council Adviser appointed by the prin- 
cipal to serve at his discretion. This adviser shall be the official sponsor for 
the Student Council, to whom the members may go for consultation and 
advice. He shall seek to promote the efficiency and well-being of the Coun- 
cil, suggest to them desirable activities and attitudes, and strive to make 
them feel their responsibilities and opportunities for service. This, however, 
he shall do through the medium of the officers or members, not by direct 
appeal or dictation. His task is to work with and through the students in 
sympathetic codperation with their organization, realizing that they need the 
experience of working out their own problems. To this end he must avoid 
making them feel that he is a censor, spy, or critic, and should display due 
moderation in attending or participating in meetings. He should, however, 
always be within call while meetings are being held. 
Student Council Faculty Committee 
There shall be a Student Council Faculty Committee of five members con- 
sisting of the principal, as chairman, two men teachers, and two women 
teachers. These four teachers shall be chosen by the faculty, two for two 
years and two for one year at the first election, thereafter two to be chosen 
annually to serve for two years. The Faculty Student Council Adviser shall 
not be a member of this Committee. 
This Committee shall function in an advisory and regulatory capacity for 
such matters concerning the Student Council as the Faculty Student Council 
Adviser or the principal feel should come to their attention. The Committee 
may, in turn, refer to the entire faculty matters which it deems of sufficient 
importance. 
The Student Council shall have the privilege of appeal to this committee 
for consultation and advice. 
All recommendations passed by the Student Council shall be submitted 
to this Committee for approval before becoming effective.

EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 659 
Home Room Representatives 
For purposes of keeping the student body in touch with the action of the 
Student Council, to enable the Council to poll the sentiment of the students, 
and to provide the necessary machinery for elections, each home room in the 
school shall elect by ballot one student member, and one alternate, to act as 
their representative. 
These home room representatives shall meet upon call of the Student 
Council, and shall advise and codperate with them. They shall not, however, 
have the right to vote or to formally participate in the Council meetings, 
nor shall they be present save by specific invitation. 
Upon these home room representatives rests the very important duty of 
disseminating and interpreting to the school as a whole the actions of the 
Council, as well as that of determining and transmitting to the Council the 
sentiments of the rooms which they represent. 
A Few Possible Activities of the Student Council 
Regulating traffic through the corridors. 
Programming dates for student parties. 
Supervising selection of cheer leaders, and promoting cheering sections at 
games. 
Suggesting lunch room regulations. 
Sponsoring auditorium programs. 
Regulating student conduct at dances and other social affairs. 
Putting on all school parties and celebrations. 
Welcoming the freshmen. 
Providing guides during Education Week. 
Creating student sentiment concerning care of the building, disposal of 
waste paper, use of paper towels, etc. 
Social Functions 
So far as possible, all student social affairs, as well as club or 
society activities, shall be held during daylight hours. 
Hours for Social Functions 
Student social functions ought to be strictly held to a closing 
hour not later than ten or ten-thirty p.m. The age and physical 
needs of adolescence, as well as the moral hazards involved, argue 
for this. There is no valid reason why pupils should not begin 
their parties and dances at seven o’clock instead of eight-fifteen or 
nine. High school students are not obliged to rush home after 
working until six o’clock, prepare supper and dress before going 
out for the evening, as some adults are. They have plenty of 
leisure and may well begin their functions at an earlier hour, if they 
desire more time. 
The habit of late hours which puts young girls on the street near 
or after midnight, when car service has been discontinued, is danger-. 
ous and should not be countenanced. There is also a certain moral 
hazard in having the building open at such hours.
-P-A-G-E-678
  
660 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
Attendance at Social Functions 
Attendance at all student social functions shall be limited to 
undergraduate students, their parents, and the faculty. 
All student social functions, including banquets and dances, shall 
be held in the high school building, unless specific exception has 
been made in each instance by vote of the faculty confirming a 
formal recommendation previously passed by both the principal 
and the Faculty Student Activities Committee. 
All student activities shall be open to visitation by any member 
of the faculty or administration at any time. 
Afternoon Parties 
The school shall seek to encourage and provide legitimate social 
activities for the entire student body. Building up the proper kind 
of social relationships will obviate much of the necessity for odious 
restrictions. As one element of such a program, it is recommended 
that afternoon parties for the two lower classes be held on Friday 
or Saturday afternoons. 
Faculty Chaperons, Patrons, etc. 
Certain faculty members, not less than two in addition to the 
regular faculty sponsor for the organization, shall be invited to 
chaperon all parties, picnics, dances, banquets, special cars, and 
other similar affairs. For this purpose, the faculty shall be divided 
by the principal into chaperon groups for each month of the school 
year, and the officers of the student groups shall, in consultation 
with their faculty sponsor, select chaperons from the certified group 
for that month, giving them at least five days’ notice. Faculty 
members so chosen, during their months will be expected to serve 
unless excused by the principal. 
Faculty sponsors should see that student officers are properly 
instructed as to getting the invited chaperons to and from the 
party, and, in the event of a dance, providing them with partners. 
Conduct at Dances 
The problem of student conduct at dances may be considered 
under two headings, namely, instruction as to proper conduct, and 
securing proper conduct. Careful attention to the former will 
obviate much of the trouble with the latter. 
(a) Instruction as to Proper Conduct 
Boys and girls of the adolescent age are extremely self-con- 
scious. They do not usually wish to do anything which makes
-P-A-G-E-679
  EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 661 
them conspicuous. For that reason, they resent the publicity 
of being reprimanded on the dance floor, and their resentment 
often takes the form of stubborn opposition to suggestion. 
The boys in their physical education classes, and the girls in 
theirs, should be given quiet, sensible talks by teachers of 
appealing personality concerning the reasons for being careful 
as to the postures assumed in dancing. This should be fol- 
lowed by demonstrations and practice in the correct postures, 
together with methods for preventing one’s partner from tak- 
ing undue liberties. It would even be possible, perhaps desir- 
able, to bring the boys’ and the girls’ gymnasium classes to- 
gether for final instruction and practice. 
(b) Securing Proper Conduct 
Having made fairly sure, through proper instruction, that all 
the students understand what the proper posture should be, the 
problem of enforcement is essentially one for the students 
themselves. The student officers of the organization having 
the dance in charge should be obliged to— 
(1) previous to the authorization of the dance, submit a 
definite plan for effective supervision. 
(2) be personally responsible for the administering of this plan 
during the dance. 
Invited chaperons and patrons should not be expected to go out 
on the floor to speak to couples. They should call one of the stu- 
dent officers and instruct him to do the needed policing. The same 
method should be followed by teachers or other school officials, for 
until the student assumes the responsibility, supervision of any kind 
will never become really effective. 
Organizations should be given to understand that a failure to live 
up to the school regulations concerning dancing will mean the 
abrogation of the privilege for the particular organization offending. 
A general failure on the part of the dancers at any particular 
dance to observe the regulations should be cause for an abrupt 
stopping of the orchestra and a warning against continued offence. 
If the warning is not heeded, then the school officials in charge 
should promptly close the dance for the evening. It is not likely 
that such extreme measures would be needed after due instruction 
and preparation had been given, but, in any event, one such closing 
would doubtless be sufficient. 
This matter of the supervision of dances should be put under the 
general control of the Student Council for impartial enforcement 
upon all organizations.
-P-A-G-E-680
662 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
Policing of Corridors at Evening Functions 
Each organization planning a social function, entertainment, or 
event to occur in the evening, shall, before authorization is granted 
for its holding, submit to the designated representatives of the Stu- 
dent Council, satisfactory arrangements for the policing of the 
corridors. 
Evaluation of Extra-Curricular Activities 
All of the extra-curricular activities of the school, including such 
things as class office holding, literary editorships, reporting, athletics, 
etc., shall be evaluated on a point system by a special committee 
of the faculty appointed by the principal for the purpose. This 
point system shall be somewhat after the following manner: 
    
  President of any organization ............. 3 points 
HGitOMAINDa CNet eet keine Beto ioe 
Assistant Editor ee cae RnaS 
Reporter Alpha ......... Re ae 
Girls’ Athletic Team een 
Basketballs cosa eee ener ee ea be Bie ses 
Students should then be restricted in their affiliations by regula- 
tions somewhat similar to the following (copied from another high 
school) : 
At any one time a student: 
(1) may belong to 2 five-point organizations, with the privilege 
of selecting other organizations to the extent of 2 points, total 
12 points. 
(2) may belong to 1 five-point organization, with the privilege 
of selecting other organizations to the extent of five points, total 
10 points. 
(3) may distribute his membership among organizations which 
count one, two, three, or four points, as he chooses, provided total 
does not exceed 8 points. 
Such restrictions will provide a fairer distribution of responsibili- 
ties, and tend toward better health and scholarship. 
Assignment 
1. Is the point weighting for equalizing the teacher load 
satisfactory? How could it be improved? What scientific 
procedure might be followed in the development of such a 
point system? 
2. Does the assignment of all regular and special room
-P-A-G-E-681
      EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 663 
teachers to home room duty make for better distribution of 
the teaching load? Better administration? Show difficulties 
arising in administration. Does the work of the special teacher 
present any obstacles to the adoption of this program? Be 
specific. 
3. What is superior practice with respect to time schedules? 
Are these recommendations in conformity? What is the ad- 
vantage of the study-consultation period? 
4, Why include “debating and dramatics” as part of the 
regular school program and not other student activities? 
5. What are the defects of the proposed student council 
plan? 
6. What difficulties are encountered in the enforcement of 
closing hours for student social functions? Has the school the 
right to limit attendance at student social functions as has 
been done? 
7. Does a high school teacher’s contract for teaching involve 
service as a chaperon? 
8. Would it not be better to eliminate all dancing than to 
involve the administration in the enforcement of the regula- 
tions set up herein? 
9. What past tendencies have forced a restricted participa- 
tion in activities on the part of individual students? 
10. Would you, as superintendent, criticize the general 
nature of this report? Are you willing to submit it to the 
principal for enforcement? Write the letter of transmittal to 
the principal of the high school. 
11. What part should the Board of Education play in the 
review, criticism or acceptance of this report? 
12. Should the superintendent appoint the committee de- 
scribed or the high school principal? 
13. How would the particular part played by the superin- 
terident and principal vary in different situations?

The Northumberland Annual Magazine Drive 
The minutes of the Northumberland School Board show 
that permission has been granted to the agent of the “National 
Citizen” Co., the publishers of a weekly magazine, to develop 
a codperative sales enterprise with the high school children. 
The agent has accepted the privileges granted by the Board 
and for a period of years has conducted a successful magazine 
drive. 
The annual drive begins with a 40-minute discussion by the 
agent on successful salesmanship before the assembled student 
body of 250 high school children. The students, with this talk 
as a basis, then participate in a subscription “drive” with the 
understanding that the Athletic Association, or some other 
school enterprise, will receive one-half of all subscription 
money. Individual prizes are awarded to students securing as 
many as ten or twenty-five subscriptions. As a rule, no more 
than two or three class periods are taken up with this “drive,” 
the proceeds being about $100 each year. This means that 
approximately 250 subscriptions are secured for the company.

Teaching History Through the Agency of the Local Moving 
Picture Theater 
In Highview, a village of 6,000 population, one of the chap- 
ters in the development of the story of the United States is 
presented each month at the local moving picture theater. 
Each production is of a very high order, having been developed 
under the auspices of a near-by university. The superintend- 
ent is impressed with the benefit to be derived from these 
pictures. Accordingly, he has permitted the theater manager 
to distribute tickets each month among the students of the 
schools. With one of these tickets and 10 cents, admission is 
gained to a single performance. The minutes of the Board of 
Education indicate that no advertising shall be done in the 
school buildings. 
Assignment 
1. Has the administration established a precedent which 
may cause embarrassment in connection with similar appeals? 
2. Were the school authorities entitled to a commission on 
the admission fee because of the advertising? 
3. Has the superintendent exceeded his authority and

Selling Tickets for the Parent-Teacher Association 
In the city of Westville, 12,000 population, an active Parent- 
Teacher Association was organized four years ago with a mem- 
bership of 300 to 400 members which has continued its interest 
in and activity for all schools of the city. As one means of 
raising funds for the various activities in interest of the 
schools, the Association resorted to various schemes, such as 
producing local talent plays, participating in the profits of 
some motion picture of educational merit put on by one of the 
local theaters, and by bringing to the community some dra- 
matic or musical organization. For all these, the Association 
would use the school organization for advance sale of tickets, 
offering cash prizes both to individuals and to grades reporting 
the highest amounts in cash from ticket sales. Results were 
highly satisfactory from the standpoint of the treasury of the 
Association, but the people of the community, particularly 
merchants and other business men, began to express the feel- 
ing that the schools were being used too much as a ticket- 
selling organization. 
Assignment 
1. How far should the superintendent allow such practice 
to go? 
2. How could the School Board help in the solution of this 
problem? 
8. Does the selling of these tickets become a legitimate 
activity for the children because of the connection of the 
Parent-Teacher Association with the school?

contest has come from the Garfield Watch Manufacturing Co. 
which has offered an annual prize of a Garfield watch for the 
best essay on the life of Garfield written by any member of 
the senior class. The only stipulation imposed by the com- 
pany furnishing the prize is that the award should be made 
during the annual commencement program. There is no 
financial cost to the school in furthering this contest and con- 
siderable interest has been aroused in the life of Garfield. 
Assignment 
1. Should similar awards be accepted from other commercial 
concerns to stimulate activity on the part of pupils? 
2. What are the interests of the company which are being 
advanced through this enterprise? 
3. What interests of the school are furthered?

Membership in National Philanthropic Organization 
Kendall is a town of approximately 2,500, located in the 
heart of a mining district. This fact is attested by fine munic- 
ipal buildings, well-lighted, paved streets, municipal water and 
heat, and school buildings as fine as can be found anywhere. 
In rather startling contrast to public buildings are the homes 
of the miners, who receive very average wages. The popula- 
tion is largely foreign, and the families are large. 
Because of the interests of a banker in the national move- 
ment for securing membership, great stress was laid upon the 
establishment of a Junior Red Cross Organization in each 
schoolroom. Rivalry was intense to secure a 100% member- 
ship in each room. Although the membership fee was not 
large, many children found it difficult to obtain the fee. Even 
after being strongly urged to join, many pupils were unable 
in any way to obtain membership fees. A program was 
planned to raise money to purchase membership for pupils 
who were themselves unable to do so.

PROBLEM 98 
HIGH SCHOOL FRATERNITIES 
Problem: To eliminate from the group activities of the 
students of a high school with an enrolment of 1,200 the un- 
wholesome influences arising through the activities of four 
fraternities made up largely of high school boys. 
Four so-called Greek-letter fraternities, made up supposedly 
of high school students, of young men about town and of high 
school alumni, exist actively in a city of 35,000. While the 
state law prohibits the organization of high school fraternities, 
the courts have ruled that there is nothing in the law to keep 
a high school student from joining a fraternity that is made up 
in part by members who are not high school pupils. Under 
protection of this ruling of the courts, the four fraternities 
mentioned have taken in members from grades nine to twelve 
until a large percentage of their membership consists of high 
school students. 
Each fraternity has its own club rooms, located in the cen- 
ter of the city, that provide a convenient place for loitering 
and group meetings. 
It is the general sentiment of teachers and school authorities 
that the fraternities are not only a menace to the proper social 
organization of the high school, but also to the best interests 
of the boys who belong. Nothing in the whole social program 
of the fraternities is conducive to good student habits and in 
too many cases boys are led to emulate social habits of young 
men not only much older, but not infrequently of the type 
whose habits ought not be copied. 
These fraternities have existed so many years that school 
authorities are compelled to fight well established traditions in 
opposing them. The oldest fraternity in the group was orig- 
inally installed through the activity of a popular high school 
670
-P-A-G-E-689
    EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 671 
principal. A good many middle-aged business men in the city 
claim membership in some one of the four fraternities. In 
this connection it should be stated that there is some evidence 
suggesting that the organizations once functioned on a much 
higher plane. 
Similar fraternities exist in near-by cities, exchanging fra- 
ternal privileges much the same as do college fraternities. 
School authorities have not only been concerned about poor 
scholarship on the part of fraternity members, but they have 
also been compelled to meet attempts on the part of one 
fraternity or another to domineer athletics, class and other 
school activities. 
The fraternities feel that they are strong enough to strike 
back against any attempt to discipline their members. Older 
boys, no longer in school, have on repeated occasions in the 
last eight or ten years broken into the high school building 
under cover of darkness and engaged in retaliatory depreda- 
tions. Newspapers have been wont to refer to these “boyish 
pranks” in a way that encourages further indulgence in them, 
and increases the task of school authorities. The community, 
in general, accepts the whole program as if it were supposed 
to be a necessary concomitant of “high school spirit.” An oc- 
casional parent, who sees his boy fail as a result of the fra- 
ternity influence, takes exception to this point of view. 
Assignment 
1. What course should be pursued by school authorities in 
an effort to clean up the situation? 
2. What program would you present to your board of ed- 
ucation, seeking to eliminate the unfortunate influence of these 
organizations? 
3. How would you present the case to the high school 
teachers, some of whom are inclined to favor the continuance 
of the fraternities? 
4. Prepare the statement that you will ask the high school 
paper to print as a report of a discussion of the problem which 
you plan to present to the high school assembly. 
5. Draft a letter which you will send to the parents of those 
boys who are members of the fraternities.

PROBLEM 99 
ACCOUNTING FOR EXTRA-CURRICULAR 
ACTIVITIES IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
Problem: Jonesburg, Kandiana, high school has three hundred 
students with the usual student organizations, such as class, 
athletics (girls and boys separate), glee club, school paper, 
school annual, and the like. Each organization for years has 
had its treasurer, elected by the pupils chiefly for personal 
popularity. There has been no check on his handling of funds 
except by a very perfunctory teacher sponsor appointed by the 
principal. The treasurer of an organization merely received 
money and reported the amounts spent and on hand. There 
is dissatisfaction with the situation which calls for prompt 
reform. 
After several years on this basis, rumors of misused funds 
reached the principal. An investigation disclosed such things 
as these: One student treasurer had spent $25.00 of this fund, 
for which he could not account. As his mother was barely able 
to keep him in school, the loss could not be made up then. 
Another treasurer spent $8.00 of his fund on his personal 
pleasure, but his father made it up for him. The parents 
naturally blamed the school principal. All concerned agreed 
that the accounting employed gave the students no valuable 
experience, but instead tended to encourage dishonest habits. 
The principal finally made a rule that all treasurers should 
promptly deposit all receipts with him and he would issue 
checks for legitimate bills against the various funds. He 
banked all receipts in his own name and put down all amounts 
for each fund in a little notebook kept in his desk. His check 
book stubs showed for what each check was issued and he 
planned to use these stubs in determining how much money 
was left to the credit of each fund. 
When he went away for his summer vacation, he deposited 
673 
 
-P-A-G-E-692
674 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
to his personal account some $400 belonging to various student 
organizations, which had nothing to show that they possessed 
the sums deposited with him. Because of his previous censure 
of student treasurers, he was bitterly censured by these treas- 
’ urers and their relatives for questionable handling of accounts. 
Only fear of libel suits prevented open attacks on him. 
Assignment 
1. Outline a complete system of financial accounting for all 
these extra-curricular activities which would avoid the diffi- 
culties into which the students and principal fell. 
2. For each form advocated by you, indicate the wording 
and ruling so that, upon an hour’s notice, you could whip it 
into printer’s copy. 
3. Show that your system: (a) Would insure honesty on the 
part of all concerned. (b) Would give students valuable busi- 
ness training and a knowledge of business ethics. (c) Would 
not require unnecessary hack work by either principal or 
students. 
4. Indicate what differences in the system you would make 
for a high school of one thousand students or more.

PROBLEM 100 
OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE IN HIGH SCHOOL 
ATHLETICS 
Problem: Smithville, Kandiana, 5,000 population, located in 
an excellent farming country, has some industries and is in 
many respects a progressive community. It is as proud of its 
schools as of any other institution or business in the com- 
munity. 
Basketball is the chief form of high school athletics in 
Kandiana, which has a very strong state high school athletic 
association with the usual local, regional and state champion- 
ship competitions. There is danger that the discipline of the 
school will be seriously impaired by the popularity of this 
sport. 
Smithville naturally desired a winning basketball team for 
its high school, even dreamed of a state champion team. One 
year when the season was about a third over and there seemed 
good material for a championship team, outsiders induced the 
Board of Education and the superintendent to secure a special 
coach. The schools needed another teacher and could pay 
about $2,100 a year. But instead of getting this other teacher, 
the old physical education man and coach was transferred to 
teaching regular classes. In his stead a new man was brought 
in for physical education, coaching and the one class (English 
in this case) required by the regulations of the state athletic 
association. This new coach would not come for the regular 
$2,100 a year rate, so the business men of the city raised a 
purse of $1,200 for him on the side. Since he had twice won 
state championships with high school teams elsewhere, he was 
obviously employed mainly for his coaching ability. 
The basketball season under this coach was highly success- 
ful. The business men and outsiders of the community won 
much money on one particular game which they had insisted 
675
-P-A-G-E-694
  676 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
on scheduling for the middle of the week so as not to interfere 
with Saturday business. They were so elated with success in 
this game that they incited the high school students to a 
special celebration. Thus urged on, nearly all the students, 
led by the most popular high school boys, left school despite 
all efforts of the principal, held a parade and general celebra- 
tion down town and did not return to school until afternoon. 
Assignment 
1. What could the superintendent and high school principal 
have done to avoid the difficulties of which such an outbreak 
is a symptom? 
2. After the outbreak actually happened, what could they 
do to prevent a recurrence of such troubles? 
3. What is a sane positive program for high school athletics 
in its relations to physical education? 
4. What is a sane positive program for high school athletics 
in its relation to other extra-curricular activities?

PROBLEM 101 
THE RELATION OF HOME AND SCHOOL 
Problem: May we fairly require teachers to visit the home of 
each pupil at least once during the school term when they are 
not excused from regular duties to do such visitation? 
A town of thirty thousand has corps of about one hundred 
and forty teachers, of whom eighty are in the elementary 
schools, and the remainder are in the high school. The system 
is organized on the 6-6 plan with a special center for retarded 
pupils above the age of thirteen. 
There are seven elementary schools, which draw their pupils 
from certain well defined districts. One central high school 
serves the community as does also the special class center. In 
addition, classes for gifted children are maintained in three of 
the elementary schools. Classes in the elementary schools 
average between thirty and thirty-five; in the high school, 
about twenty-five. 
Teachers in the special classes, including the classes for 
gifted children, are paid $200 more annually than the teachers 
in regular grades. The elementary school day begins at 8:30 
and ends at 4:00. The high school day begins at 8:10 and 
ends at 4:30, the teacher’s load being adjusted to meet the 
requirements of the North Central Association. 
Assignment 
1. Shall teachers be required to visit the homes of all chil- 
dren enrolled in their classes, or only in case of pupils who are 
failing? 
2. Under what circumstances, if any, should the principal 
be required to visit the homes of children enrolled in his 
school? 
3. Shall teachers be excused from a part of the day’s work 
until they have completed their home visits? 
677 
 
-P-A-G-E-696
  678 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
4. Shall one or two teachers from each school be selected, 
or one or two teachers from each field of subject matter in the 
high school as representatives of their groups to do such vis- 
itation, excusing them from a part of their regular duties while 
so engaged? 
5. Shall visiting teachers be employed? If you believe this 
to be the best solution of the problem, prepare a brief support- 
ing your contention for your guidance in presenting the matter 
to the Board of Education and in the preparation of an article 
for the local press.

PROBLEM 102 
ABATING A NUISANCE 
Problem: Near the high school in any city is a store estab- 
lished primarily to cater to the students of the school. It sells 
candy, soda, light refreshments, tobacco, and the like, and is a 
loafing place for high school students. In the eyes of the 
high school principal and teachers it is a nuisance. It un- 
doubtedly gives rise to a continuous series of difficult and 
annoying problems in high school discipline. 
The store is situated so that it cannot be seen directly 
from the high school principal’s office. Consequently, boys can 
go there during school hours. In fact, several of them can go 
there during school hours without being seen by him. Fairly 
often several will meet at the store, each having left a different 
class on pretext of going to the toilet. They will meet at the 
store, smoke a cigarette, loaf for ten or fifteen minutes and 
then return to laboratory or study hall. They do not leave 
regular recitations often. 
Many boys and some girls do much loafing around the store 
before and after school hours, especially at noon. There is a 
great deal of cigarette smoking and frequently gambling, par- 
ticularly with dice. 
The physical education teachers say that the smoking and 
loafing are seriously undermining their attempts at physical 
training. The domestic science department teachers say that 
the eating at irregular hours of so much trash and sweets is 
undoing almost wholly the work in sound dietaries which they 
are endeavoring to give the students. 
The proprietor has been remonstrated with, but says that 
he does not permit gambling, maintains that it does not go on 
in his place, but says that, if he drives the boys out on the 
sidewalk, he cannot prevent their shooting dice there, and 
should not be held responsible for their doing it.

PROBLEM 103 
SELECTION OF NEW MEMBERS OF THE TEACHING 
STAFF 
Problem: To determine the policy to be pursued by a superin- 
tendent of schools in the selection of new members of the 
teaching staff. 
The Board of Education of Wilson, N. K., has for many 
years been taking a very active part in the selection of new 
teachers as vacancies have occurred. It has been the practice 
for the members of the teachers’ committee to invite personal 
application from candidates seeking positions. These can- 
didates have also been interviewed by the superintendent of 
schools and have filled out the teachers’ application form 
(page 684) thus giving the essential family, preparation and 
experience data, together with the names of references. 
The candidates have also been permitted to submit to mem- 
bers of the Board or to the superintendent letters of recom- 
mendation which they have received from officials in other 
teaching relationships. 
The superintendent of schools has completed the record of 
the candidate by submitting the reference blank (page 685) 
to individuals whom the candidates have named as references. 
Occasionally the superintendent of schools has visited can- 
didates who were teaching in neighboring cities and has made 
a record of such visitations. 
It has been the practice for the teachers’ committee to hold 
its annual meeting the first week in May at which time the 
accumulated materials, as outlined above, formed the basis 
for the work of the members in deciding upon the new appoint- 
ments. The superintendent has found at these meetings that 
much other information concerning local candidates has been 
confided to the members of the Board, such information in-

cluding church affiliations, family relationships and political 
alignments. 
Each year the committee has begun its work in connection 
with its first vacancy by seeking the opinion of the superin- 
tendent of schools concerning the candidates, debating the 
merits of the candidates and finally deciding the issue by com- 
mittee vote. The superintendent has found himself at a great

PROBLEM 104 
THE TRAINING, EXPERIENCE AND TENURE OF 
TEACHERS IN A CITY SCHOOL SYSTEM 
TOWSEN, N. K. 
Problem: During recent years, the success of a candidate’s ap- 
plication for a teaching position in Towsen has been deter- 
mined in the first instance by residence in Towsen itself. All 
candidates living in Towsen or in the immediate vicinity, if 
eligible under the state law, were first selected. When this list 
of local eligibles was exhausted, other candidates were con- 
sidered. The selection is primarily the duty of the superin- 
tendent of schools who recommends candidates to the Board 
of Education for election. Local pressure from parents of 
candidates and from the press has played a part in producing 
the situation. The superintendent has been anxious to present 
to his Board an analysis of the staff showing what results have 
followed from this method of selection. The Director of Re- 
search has prepared the following statistical analysis. What 
are the recommendations growing out of this analysis which a 
superintendent might present to his Board of Education? 
The analysis of the Teaching Staff by the Director of Re- 
search was as follows: 
The home addresses and birthplaces of the teaching staff of 1924- 
25 are shown in Table 1. 
The extent of preparation of this same teaching staff is shown in 
Table 2. 
In 1920, it was found that among all the women elementary school 
teachers in 359 cities in the United States,’ 68.8 per cent had two 
years training above high school or better. In 1922-23, 79 per cent 
of 1,027 city school systems reported normal graduation was re- 
quired for election to elementary teaching positions. Ninety-three 
per cent of cities of 30,000 to 100,000 population in the United 
States had such a requirement.?

In 1920, it was found that among all high school teachers in 359 
cities in United States,! 66.1 per cent had had four years of college 
preparation or better. 
The requirement of college graduation for candidates for ordinary 
teaching positions in high school has become almost universal. 
In 1923, 95 per cent of cities of 30,000 to 100,000 population in the 
United States ? had such a requirement in the employment of new 
teachers. 
Normal school graduation or better is rapidly becoming a uni- 
versal requirement of candidates for positions in city elementary 
schools.

    690 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
From Table 3, it will be seen that 59 elementary school teachers 
were prepared in the local training school or training class and 46 
in the state normal school which is most conveniently located with 
reference to Towsen. The teachers trained in all other institutions 
number only 40. 
It should be observed that a two-year course in the local training 
school named cannot be comparable in value to a two-year 
course in a large state normal school because the facilities of the 
local training school are necessarily extremely limited; this training 
school has never had a faculty of more than one or two instructors.

Table 4 shows that 15 of the high school teachers were educated 
at College A, Home State, 5 at College B, Home State and 4 at 
College C, Home State, these constituting a majority of the whole 
corps. The remaining 20 were educated in nine colleges, two normal 
schools, two high schools and the local training school. 
This review of the institutions in which teachers were prepared 
confirms the findings as to geographical origin in which it was seen 
that teachers were drawn very largely from a restricted area.

Professional Progress of Teachers as Measured by Summer Study 
One of the best measures of professional progress on the part of 
teachers is the extent to which they have availed themselves of 
opportunities for study in the summer sessions of our universities

and normal schools. From one to two hundred thousand teachers 
on an average are now believed to be attending summer sessions 
every summer in the United States, or more than one teacher in 
every five. 
Experience in the School Systems 
The experience of Towsen teachers in other school systems is 
shown in Table 6. Nearly half the elementary school teachers and 
one-third the high school teachers have had no experience in any 
other school system except that of Towsen. In the case of ele- 
mentary teachers who have had other experience, a great many 
merely taught in rural schools before coming into the Towsen 
schools. Only 19 per cent of the elementary teachers have had as 
many as five years of experience outside of Towsen.

Relation of Salaries to Training 
From an examination of Table 7, it will be seen that the median 
elementary salary is also the maximum. The maximum salary has 
been reached by more than half of all the elementary teachers, in 
fact by 70 per cent of them. From direct inspection, it is evident 
that the amount of training is not exerting any marked influence on 
the attainment of a maximum salary. Of the 95 teachers who are 
drawing a maximum, 45 per cent have a training represented by 
normal school graduation or better, now generally accepted as the 
standard requirement for all candidates for elementary teaching 
positions; but 55 per cent of the teachers drawing a maximum 
salary have training inferior to that represented by normal school 
graduation. One-third of all teachers drawing a maximum salary 
have training no greater than that of one year beyond high school, 
and about one-twelfth of them have no training beyond high school.
-P-A-G-E-711
  
PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 693 
While only 45 per cent of the teachers who draw a maximum salary 
have training to the extent of normal school graduation or better, 
among the teachers who do not receive a maximum salary, 57 per 
cent have this amount of training.

In the high school, as shown in Table 8, the relationship between 
salary and training is not quite so clear. However, if one considers 
the maximum salary for those who are not department heads, viz.: 
$2,000, it is seen that this salary is drawn by nine teachers who meet 
the requirement of four years’ preparation beyond high school 
graduation, while eight teachers drawing this salary fall short of

PROBLEM 105 
RATING TEACHERS 
Problem: Shall the promotion and dismissal of teachers be 
determined by the rating given to them by the superintendent 
of schools? 
| 
The Facts | 
The vexing educational situation has arisen in Eagle Grove 
—a community of 8,000 population—in which the patrons of 
the school, the School Board, the superintendent, and the fac- 
ulty are in bitter disagreement over the retention and promo- 
tion of certain members of the teaching staff; and a proposed 
dismissal of three grade teachers, of good social standing, on 
the grounds of inefficiency. 
The dissension among the patrons and the factional disputes 
of the community pivot in the belief that the superintendent 
of schools has not only discriminated unjustly, but acted in- 
discreetly in recommending the advancement of younger 
teachers in preference to older members of the staff. 
The superintendent of schools, however, feels that by virtue 
of his successful experience in the selection and assignment of 
teachers, he has acted wisely in his recommendations. He be- 
lieves that he has personally rated the teachers justly, and only 
after due observation of their teaching, careful consideration 
of their results, and complete knowledge of their effort at pro- 
fessional improvement. 
The faculty, as a group, believe that a more just and 
equitable method than the personal judgment of the superin- 
tendent can be reached in the transfer and rating of teachers; 
and feel that the best interests of the school demand a more 
effective method. Accordingly they have adopted a policy 
which appears to them to provide a “measurable basis” for 
adjustment among their ranks, and have proceeded to “ad- 
696
-P-A-G-E-715
PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 697 
vise” the superintendent in this regard. Their policy in sub- 
stance embodies these points: 
Common consent. 
. Rating of teaching rather than teachers. 
. Several judgments rather than one. 
. Separate rating entirely independent from salary schedule 
consideration. 
5. Planned and executed primarily with reference to the improve- 
ment of teaching. 
6. The utilization of every available means and method. 
Awe 
The members of the School Board are divided in their reac- 
tion to the situation with the result that the superintendent’s 
respect, confidence and support with the Board are in jeopardy. 
Assignment 
1. What constitutes a just and equitable method? 
2. What method will be most effective for the best interests 
of the Eagle Grove schools? 
3. Is it feasible to combine subjective with objective 
analysis? 
4. Can desirable teaching qualities be determined quanti- 
tatively? 
5. What is the best way of reducing chance in appointment 
to a minimum? 
6. Is “result” in the pupils the best measurable basis? 
7. Is the self-rating by teachers a good working scheme in 
this given situation? 
8. What relative emphasis should be given to rating the 
teacher, study of teaching, gauging results, and effort at pro- 
fessional improvement? 
Types and Methods of Approach 
Typical methods of estimating and recognizing merit of 
teachers: 
1. Unanalyzed judgment. 
2. Analyzed judgment—comparison of persons in army; Rugg’s 
adaptation—at least three ratings by those specially prepared 
necessary to give useful results,
-P-A-G-E-716
698 PROBLEMS IN as ae ADMINISTRATION 
8. Standards—qualitative application; e.g. McMurry’s provision 
for motive, consideration of values, attention to organization, 
opportunity for initiative, and use of knowledge. 
4. Scales—made up of sample lessons graded as to merit in the 
type of teaching represented; e.g. Courtis’s Research Scales 
(partially completed). | 
5. Score cards and check lists: 
Types—weighted or unweighted; for single visits or general 
estimates. 
Items commonly included; personal and social qualities, 
academic and professional preparation, teaching ability, and 
professional spirit. 
Methods of weighting. 
Methods of scoring. 
Degree of objectivity obtained. 
Dangers involved in the use of score cards. 
Connor’s attempt to avoid these dangers. 
6. Standard tests: | 
As measure of teachers’ ability and indication of probable 
success; of teachers’ examinations. 
As measures of pupils’ ability and achievements; of teachers’ 
judgments.

PROBLEM 106 
MAKING A SALARY SCHEDULE 
Problem: The Board of Education of the city of Arundel 
(20,000 population) has never adopted a salary schedule for 
teachers. A committee of teachers was once appointed by 
the former superintendent to work out and to present to the 
Board a salary schedule, but the old home teachers with long 
experience and little training disagreed with the young teach- 
ers with training as to the relative weight which these two 
factors should have in determining salaries of teachers. The 
committee failed to agree. It was dismissed without a report 
to the Board. The situation demands action by the Board. 
What will be your recommendations? 
The former superintendent employed teachers at whatever 
salary would enable him to secure their services. The market 
price and the individual price were paid. Some came high at 
critical times of the year, and others were employed at very 
high salaries or very low salaries according to the demand 
which they made or the influence which they could bring to 
bear upon the superintendent of schools. 
A committee of the teachers, three years ago, with the aid 
of the various civic clubs, the labor unions, and the city 
politicians, succeeded in securing an increase in salaries. 
When this increase was given, something could have been done 
very easily to have established a schedule, but instead a 25 
per cent flat increase was given all teachers. This flat increase 
just served to increase the discrepancy which already existed 
between the salaries of those who had been employed at or 
were drawing high salaries, and those more unfortunate teach- 
ers who had entered the system at a very low figure or had 
never appeared before the Board or pushed their case hard 
enough to get a raise. | 
It is discouraging, demoralizing, and irritating to those well 
trained teachers, and to those teachers of long experience and 
700 
 
-P-A-G-E-719
  PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 701 
fair training to be receiving salaries far below other teachers 
teaching right beside them in the same building, who are get- 
ting in many cases $200 and $300 more per year and who may 
have both less experience and less training, or less experience 
and the same training, or the same experience and less training. 
These discrepancies are known for the most part by the 
various teachers, and many complaints have been lodged for a 
fair consideration of various individual cases on the part of 
those who are the hardest hit by this inequality. The Board 
of Education has announced that it will allow $15,000 in the 
next annual budget to take care of the present inequalities in 
salaries. The solution of the question by provision of a salary 
schedule based upon training and experience has, however, not 
been reached. 
Twenty-five hundred dollars ($2,500) has been distributed 
over a period of two years to wipe out some of the widest 
discrepancies. It was found upon investigation that by tak- 
ing the average salary of the beginners with five years of 
training above high school and no experience, an average 
salary of $1,000 had been paid, and that the average of the 
highest paid experienced teachers in this group was $1,400. 
Therefore a tentative salary scale was made for this group of 
teachers beginning with a minimum of $1,000 and reaching a 
maximum of $1,400 after twenty years of experience, which 
facts represented the tendency in practice. 
It was found in the same manner that the average salary for 
those of six years’ training started with a minimum of $1,080 
and advanced to a maximum of $1,450 after fifteen years of 
experience. Teachers with seven years of training had begun 
at an average of $1,200, and had advanced to a maximum 
average of $1,500, over a period of twelve years. Teachers 
with eight years of training had been employed, for the 
women, at an average beginning salary of $1,320, and had 
advanced to an average maximum of $1,600 after ten years of 
experience. Men with eight years of training had begun at an 
average of $1,600 and advanced to $2,000 over a period of ten 
years, but few had over three years of continuous service in 
this city. 
A table composed of four columns for training, and forty 
lines across these training columns for experience was then
-P-A-G-E-720
NET 
702 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
made. In the upper left-hand corner of each square thus 
made, was placed the index salary in red for that particular 
amount of training and experience. 
Then the salary of each teacher was placed in its proper 
square, and the deviation computed either plus or minus. The 
total of all the significant minus deviations was then entered. 
This chart was placed before the Board. The members were 
very much surprised. This was their first knowledge of what 
they were paying teachers, and the general consensus of opin- 
ion was that these minus deviations should be adjusted within 
a few years. Accordingly over a period of the past two years, 
although no funds had been raised for that particular purpose, 
$2,500 has been applied to this purpose in the following man- 
ner: Those with the largest minus deviations were given the 
larger amounts in proportion to the amount of the funds dis- 
tributed. $7,000 would still be required to wipe out all minus 
deviations from the averages established. 
The principals and the president of the local teachers’ as- 
sociation have been shown the results of the investigation and 
have been informed as to the nature of the increases given. 
The information has been received favorably by the teachers. 
The demand for a committee investigation into the reason why 
some teachers received increases and others did not stopped. 
The president of the teachers’ association happened to be one 
of those who would not get an increase because she had already 
been enjoying a salary above the average for those having the 
same training and experience. 
The facts as they now exist in regard to the salary situation 
after two years of adjustment are shown in Table 1. 
The present range of salaries of elementary teachers in the 
first six grades is $1,000 to $1,500. The median salary is 
$1,255. The median length of experience is nine years. Table 
2 gives evidence of considerable correlation between length 
of experience and size of salary. A wide scatter of ages is 
noted, and the gap which exists to a certain extent between 
the younger group and the older group of home teachers for 
the most part is very sparsely filled in, which shows the lack 
of holding power of the salary situation as now administered. 
The mode is six years of training beyond the high school, 
the median is 6.4 years. Sixty-nine per cent of the elementary

teachers have six or more years of training beyond the high 
school. There is evidence of considerable correlation between 
salary and the amount of training above the high school. The 
correlation would be quite high were only five of the very old

high salaries not considered. These data show that 69 per

The median length of experience for women junior and 
senior high school teachers is 12.5 years. No correlation what- 
ever is in evidence between length of experience and salary. 
A very desirable age variation is shown in Table 3. 
The median salary is $1,541. The range in salaries paid to 
members of this group is very narrow—$1,300 to less than 
$1,700, with two scattering exceptions. It would appear that 
the maximum is not sufficiently high to permit of the proper 
variation, and adequate salaries. 
Table 4 shows that the median amount of training is 8.2 
years; 63% have eight or more years of training beyond the 
elementary school. This does not represent a satisfactory 
condition in amount of training, because practically 90% 
should have eight or more years of training. The vocational

with six or seven years. Only a slight relation is seen to exist 
between salary and length of training. There is a slight rela- 
tion, but the number of cases is too small to permit of any 
positive statement. 
The median length of experience of men teachers in the 
junior and senior high schools is 6.5 years. The median salary

is $1,929. The median salary may be considered satisfactory, 
but the upper limit of the range, $2,200, is not sufficient. A 
very high correlation is in evidence, however, between length 
of experience and salary. 
No relationship whatever is indicated between salary and 
length of training. This may be accounted for by the number 
of vocational and commercial teachers included among the 
men teachers in proportion to their numbers. These men have 
less training than the academic teachers in colleges and normal 
schools, but make up for the difference by practical training 
in the industries and business. 
The median length of preparation is 8.4 years. Sixty-nine 
per cent have eight years or more of training beyond the ele- 
mentary school. This condition is very satisfactory because 
thirty-nine per cent of the men teachers are vocational teach- 
ers, a much more satisfactory condition of training than exists 
among the women junior and senior high school teachers. 
Assignment 
1. Since the city is now engaged in a building program, and 
since the tax levy is already above the third quartile of twenty 
other cities of its size in the same district, would it be advis- 
able to maintain the minimum salaries as discovered by the 
investigation? 
2. Will it be possible and is it desirable to place the men and 
women on the same schedule as regards training and 
experience?
-P-A-G-E-725
PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 707 
3. Should the time which it takes teachers of six years train- 
ing beyond the elementary school to reach their maximums be’ 
reduced? 
4. Should the maxima for the men and women in the eight 
years of training group be increased? 
5. Will you recommend that the single salary schedule be 
adopted, that is, that equal training and experience draw equal 
salaries without regard to the grade or year in which teachers 
are employed? 
6. What increments of increase will you propose where the 
new maxima. are provided?

PROBLEM 107 
TEACHERS’ ABSENCES 
Problem: For how many days and under what conditions 
should teachers be allowed pay for days which they are absent 
from school? 
In Liverpool, a city of 9,000 population, the teaching staff 
have asked the superintendent to recommend changes in the 
form of teachers’ contract of which the following is a copy. 
The teachers object particularly to the clause indicating the 
provision made for payment in case of personal illness. 
THIS AGREEMENT executed in duplicate this 
day of ——_———__—, A.D., 19—by and between: 
——_————party of the first part, and the Board of Education of 
the Independent School District of the City of Liverpool of the 
county of Adams and State of N. K., party of the second part, 
WITNESSETH: That the party of the first part, for and in con- 
sideration of the payment of the sum of $-————————, to be 
paid at the time and in the manner hereinafter set forth as the 
consideration for the performance of this entire contract, contracts 
and agrees to teach in the —---_—_—__ department of the said 
Independent School District for the full period of thirty-eight (38) 
weeks beginning —-————_ 19—,, and ending —--___—_ 19 
with such vacation intervals as shall be determined upon and 
directed by the said party of the second part; said payments to be 
made in warrants of the said second party, drawn on its treasury, 
received and accepted at the face value thereof, as follows: 
One-twelfth of the entire sum to be paid at the end of each 
calendar month, payable the first day of the following month. 
It is further agreed and understood that in case party of the 
first part is released from this contract or is dismissed before the 
close of school for the aforesaid school year, there shall be due and 
payable to said party of the first part salary in proportion as num- 
ber of days taught bears to number of days in the school year. 
It is further agreed and understood that if said party of the first 
part is absent from duty on account of personal illness or death in 
708
-P-A-G-E-727
  
PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 709 
the family, said party of the first part shall be allowed five (5) 
days’ absence each semester without the loss of pay. 
It is further agreed that in case the first party shall sign a con- 
tract before August Ist, of said year, for the year succeeding the 
term of this contract and shall refuse to comply therewith without 
thirty days’ notice before the 1st of September of said year, the 
August salary hereunder shall not be payable. 
Party of the first part further agrees to enforce and conform to 
all laws, rules and regulations governing said school district, a copy 
of which laws, rules and regulations is on file with the clerk of said 
district and are hereby made part of this contract. 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, party of the first 
part has hereunto set-————_hand and the said 
party of the second part has caused the same to be 
executed by its President and Clerk the day and 
year first above written. 
  
Teacher President of the Board of Education 
Vacation Address 
Clerk of the Board of Education 
The superintendent, on investigation, finds the practice in 
American cities with reference to payment for absence on ac- 
count of sickness to be as shown in Table 1. He also finds a 
great variation in the percentages of the salary deducted when 
deductions are made. Among these deductions for each day’s 
absence was 1/20th of the monthly salary; 1/30th of the 
monthly salary; amount paid the substitute; 1/365 of the 
annual salary; and 1/200th of the annual salary. The amounts 
deducted varied also with the method of payment, namely 
whether made on a ten-months or twelve-months basis. 
On further investigation of studies made on the physical 
efficiency of teachers, it was found that— 
“Such teaching factors as size of classes, type of school, teaching 
in foreign or in congested sections, age, experience, salary, years 
of education, and the like, which have ordinarily been associated 
with physical strain, bear no significant relation to the number of 
days of sick leave taken each year.” *

Assignment 
1. Is the provision which the teachers oppose objectionable 
to you? Ifso, on what grounds? What would you substitute? 
2. Is this form of teachers’ contract satisfactory in other 
respects? 
3. What attitude should a school board take toward pro- 
fessional teachers with reference to deductions from salary? 
4, Has it been your experience that similar treatment with 
reference to deductions is accorded to—(@) superintendent and 
teachers, (b) special teachers and regular teachers, (c) teachers 
and janitors, (d) teachers and nurses, (e) teachers and atten- 
dance staff, (f) teachers and principals? 
5. If a deduction is to be made, what safeguards should be 
arranged for fair and unbiased application of the rule? 
6. Does experience show that certification of illness by the 
family physician is less desirable than by the school physician? 
7. The above contract recognizes only two acceptable 
reasons for absence, i.e., personal illness and death in family. 
Comment on such other reasons as—(a) illness of a member 
of the family, (6) days of visiting schools, (c) attending ed- 
ucational conventions, (d) attending funeral of intimate 
friend, (e) acting as representative of local civic club at annual 
convention, (f) attending marriage of sister, (g) marriage of a 
male teacher. 
8. What advantages accrue from a “cumulative plan” al- 
lowing teacher to take all allowed days of absence at one time 
at end of a five-year period if not taken before that time? 
9. Does group health insurance provide a satisfactory 
method of solving this problem? Who should pay the pre- 
miums? Why? 
10. What percentage of the budget for instructional service 
should be normally set aside for “substitute teacher service”? 
11. What is the practice in private schools, normal schools 
and universities with respect to deduction in case of absence?

PROBLEM 108 
TEACHERS’ PENSIONS 
Problem: A state pension or retirement system has been in 
effect in a state (California) for a number of years. It pro- 
vides that each teacher in return for an annual contribution 
of $12 shall be entitled to retirement with a pension of $500 
after thirty years of service, at least fifteen of which shall have 
been in the state. A bill is introduced in the state legislature 
raising the teachers’ contributions to $24 a year and the re- 
tirement allowance to $750. The governor of the state de- 
nounces the bill, says that the state retirement system is 
“bankrupt” and that the whole “pensioning” idea is wrong and 
that the law should be completely wiped from the books. 
What issues are raised by this situation, and what facts are 
needed as a basis for intelligent decisions? 
Some Facts 
Twenty-two states have state-wide teacher retirement laws 
in effect. Hight other states have state laws affecting the 
teachers in the larger cities. 
In a number of the states not included in the two groups 
above, local retirement systems are in effect. 
Fourteen representative state teacher retirement systems 
reported for the fiscal year as follows: Income of retirement 
funds, $14,643,943.99; expenditures from retirement funds, 
$3,713,682.00. 
The National Education Association and most of the state 
education associations are committed to a policy of supporting 
the establishment of teacher retirement systems. 
Assignment 
1. Should the establishment of insurance and old age pen- 
sion systems be matters of private or public concern, or both? 
715
-P-A-G-E-734
  716 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
2. Is there any reason why the state should be more con- 
cerned with the establishment of retirement systems for teach- 
ers than for other groups? 
3. What are some of the larger controversial issues that arise 
in connection with the establishment of teacher retirement 
systems? 
4. When may a state be said to have a financially sound 
retirement system? (Is the California retirement system 
“sound”? The New York State System?) 
5. What are some of the lessons that may be drawn from 
the past experience of teacher retirement systems?

PROBLEM 109 
RELATION OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS 
TO THE HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 
Problem: The city of Lawson has a population of 60,000 peo- 
ple with large industrial plants and a foreign-born popula- 
tion, making up about 63 per cent of the total city population. 
A census, the first school census in twenty years, shows that a 
large number of children are out of school without working 
papers and no accurate registration of the school population 
has been available for many years. 
For two or three years, the school authorities have been 
developing a vocational school for boys and girls. Although 
an appropriation of $10,000 had been requested by the Board 
of Education, the city authorities allowed but $5,000. 
With the $5,000 obtained from the city and a like amount 
from the state department, and generous contributions of ma- 
chines and tools by local industrial concerns, an old school 
building condemned for school purposes by the state depart- 
ment was fully equipped by the pupils for a vocational school. 
It was also used for the continuation school pupils after an 
early dismissal of the vocational school classes. 
By a continuous publicity campaign, the people became 
more deeply interested in that school than any other school 
in the city. The overcrowded high school was relieved of a 
large number of boys whose mentality would not justify their 
being admitted to the traditional high school courses. No 
industrial arts was being offered in the high school for such 
students. 
A commercial and industrial survey of the city had been 
made with the codperation of the state department and the 
curriculum contents carefully adjusted to community needs. 
Machine shop, woodworking, printing, electrical and auto re- 
pair shops were put in operation. The school enrolment grew 
to 230 boys. 
The members of the graduating class were quickly absorbed

Figures showing comparative costs of the vocational school 
with those of other cities of the state and other schools in the 
same community show that the cost is the lowest per-capita 
cost for vocational school within the state but high as com- 
pared with the per-capita cost of high school and elementary 
school education within the city. 
In September, 1921, a junior high school program was in- 
stituted in the city and adequate shop facilities were included 
in the building plans. At this juncture, the whole personnel 
of the Board of Education was changed by the appointment 
by the mayor of three new members to check the so-called 
extravagant results of the type of vocational education pro- 
gram and to prevent the inclusion of industrial arts depart- 
ments in the new building program. 
The new members immediately attacked the vocational 
school on the basis of the undesirability of power machines, 
claiming that: 
1. The Board of Education would be liable for personal injuries 
to pupils using circular saws and planers. 
2. The school should not train boys to be mere adjuncts to 
machines. 
3. The per-capita cost is too high. (About $165.00 per pupil.) 
4. The number of boys accommodated in class is too small. 
(20-80.)
-P-A-G-E-737
PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 719 
5. The products of the school do not justify the expenditures 
made. 
6. The boys should be taught hand work but not allowed to use 
power machines. 
In order to further strengthen their case against the policy 
of the superintendent and the former Board of Education, the 
high school principal was requested by the new board members 
to write out his ideas regarding the increased costs of education 
in the city and to offer suggestions to reduce the present cost. 
The analysis as presented to a committee of the Board of 
Education unbeknown to the superintendent follows: 
Facts Concerning Increased Costs of Schools 
I, Average annual cost of schooling per pupil in the United States 
has increased from $16.67 in 1900 to about $70.00 in 1921. 
1. Enrolment between 1911 and 1921 increased 43%. Popula- 
tion increased only 30%. (19 cities.) 
a. Increased cost largely due to increased enrolment. 
II. Large increase in enrolment is in upper grammar grades and 
high schools. 
1. A study of 19 cities. 
III. Public demands high school training for all important positions. 
1. During the war, school enrolment fell owing to high wages 
for unskilled workers. 
2. At present time a child without at least a high school educa- 
tion is in the ditch-digging class. 
3. Public must either pay bills to a reasonable extent or lower 
standards and employ uneducated workers at better salaries. 
IV. Children are not leaving school at the end of the 6th grade nor 
at the end of the 8th grade and a much larger per cent is 
finishing the high school. 
Reducing Excessive School Costs 
I. Less expensive buildings must be constructed. For example, 
Roosevelt Elementary School constructed at an expense of 
about $150,000.00. 
a. Less exterior decoration and more equipment on the inside. 
II. Centralize Supply Department in Lawson. 
1. An estimate of the yearly savings by such construction 
shows that approximately $20,000 could be saved. 
2. Such a department is more business-like and more easily 
checked up.
-P-A-G-E-738
  720 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
III. Should not employ skilled painters, masons, plumbers, etc., at 
exorbitant wages to do the work of common janitors. 
1. Absurd to send for plumber to tighten joint in leaky pipes, 
the painter to paint a door, etc. 
IV. Require pupils sixteen years of age or over to show 80% 
achievement or make way for those who will. 
1. High schools are carrying too much dead wood. 
2. The theory that all children can pursue and complete a 
high school course breaks down. From 15% to 30% of 
high school registration is doing unsatisfactory work. 
V. Elimination of the expensive (so-called) vocational educa- 
tion. 
1. Vocational education is the most expensive. 
2. Is it worth the added cost? 
3. Can our educators point to any real advantages accruing 
from it? 
4. Can it be defined? 
VI. Eliminate very early pupils who are mentally unfitted to 
progress normally through schools. 
1. From 2% to 4% of our school children are unable to do 
normal work. 
2. Elimination of those means more room for normal chil- 
dren and fewer expensive courses of study. 
3. Burden of feeble-minded and atypical children should be 
borne by parents. 
VII. Twelve-months school year. 
1. Saves time of pupil. 
2. Provides 20% increased use of school buildings. 
VIII. Lengthen school day. 
1. Require six teaching-periods of 45-50 minutes each of all 
high school teachers. 
a. Reduce number of repeaters. 
b. Increase quality of work. 
c. Save teachers. 
(1) At present time in Lawson, one extra period per 
teacher would mean 80 extra classes per day. This 
is equivalent to the work of sixteen teachers at 
present. 
(2) Relieve high school teachers of clerical work and 
add one period to schedule. This would cost two 
extra-whole-time clerks ($2,000-$3,000) and would 
save 16 teachers or $30,000 per year. 
(3) This would only be possible with a lengthened 
school day consisting of eight periods of 45 minutes

each, with 4 minutes per period allowed for the 
passing of classes. This requires a single session 
organization. 
A member of the committee of the Board of Education 
brought the report to the superintendent of schools and asked 
him what he thought of it. 
Assignment 
1. What should the superintendent of schools think about 
it? 
2. How should he take the matter up with the high school 
principal who has been considered loyal and friendly? 
3. How can the superintendent defend his program without 
involving the friendly board member in an unfortunate 
manner? 
4, How can the superintendent check the harm done by the 
silent dissemination of these views? 
5. Should the superintendent make these “suggestions” pub- 
lic and openly attack their educational value? 
6. Suspecting that they are being used to create ill will be- 
tween the superintendent and principal, what attitude should 
he take? 
7. Under what circumstances is a high school principal 
justified in making such recommendations without consulting 
the superintendent?

PROBLEM 110 
ASSIGNMENT OF KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS 
Problem: The superintendent of schools in a large city has 
found it necessary to retrench in every way possible in order 
to be able to provide sufficient school facilities for the chil- 
dren of his community. In his scrutiny of costs during the 
past five years he is struck with the relatively high cost of 
kindergarten education. He has asked his supervisor of kin- 
dergartens and primary grades and certain representative 
principals to prepare for his consideration recommendations 
which will make possible savings in this part of the school 
system. Acting upon their recommendations he has presented 
to the Board of Education a plan for the reassignment of kin- 
dergarten teachers. The situation developed as is indicated 
below. 
Snowden is a southern city of over 250,000 population. 
There were in the city 65 elementary public schools for white 
children, 49 of which included kindergarten classes which held 
half-day sessions (9 A.M. to 12 m.). Teachers of these classes 
were subject to assignment of work by their respective build- 
ing principals in the afternoon hours (1 p.m. to 3 p.m.). In 
few cases are children compelled to walk more than ten blocks 
to reach school from their homes. Children of four (3 yr. 10 
mo. minimum) to six were admitted to kindergarten classes. 
The administration (supervisory department especially) 
found that kindergarten classes opening the session with 
80 children (three teachers) enrolled, would at the end of the 
first quarter have an average attendance of forty to fifty and 
by the end of the first term as few as thirty in average atten- 
dance. Weather conditions, epidemics of measles, mumps, 
etc., were given by way of explanation for poor attendance. It 
was also learned through questionnaires that few kindergarten 
teachers were regularly occupied in the afternoon to three 
722 
 
-P-A-G-E-741
  PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 723 
o’clock, the closing hour. These teachers used the afternoon 
in preparation for the kindergarten classes the next day. 
There were cases of flat refusal by these teachers to comply 
with the request to do work clearly within the province of the 
principal to ask. 
The administration, already embarrassed financially, sought 
to retrench here by removing one teacher, sometimes two 
teachers, from the three-teacher kindergartens; and one from 
the two-teacher groups. A further adjustment was made by 
having one teacher meet a small class in one school in the 
morning, 9-11:30, and another small group in a neighboring 
school in the afternoon, 1 to 3 o’clock. 
A storm of indignation burst over the heads of the admin- 
istrators in which for a time the newspapers espoused the 
cause of the kindergarten teachers who represented among 
their ranks some of the first families of the state and who had 
strong political pull. 
The School Board (five in number) had just received two 
new members, filling two vacancies of members whose terms 
had expired. One of these at a stormy session had been made 
president a few weeks after he began his service upon the 
Board. One, a good business man, seemed to believe it his 
duty to champion the cause of any one who complained of the 
administration. A third member, a woman, was appealed to 
upon the basis of her interest in children. 
After prolonged debate held at many meetings, lasting over 
a period of months, the Board voted to accept the recommen- 
dations of the superintendent of schools. No teacher was dis- 
missed, but the surplus among the kindergarten teachers were 
placed in grade positions for which their normal school train- 
ing and subsequent extension work had qualified them. Out 
of eighty kindergarten teachers formerly used as such 49 re- 
mained in the kindergarten work. Reports as to the work of 
the others in the grades are most gratifying. 
The administration saved something over $45,000. It is now 
proposed that the two-school kindergarten teacher, teaching 
in one kindergarten in the morning and in another in the after- 
noon, has been found most satisfactory in this city. If this is 
instituted throughout the city a further saving of some $10,000 
to $20,000 will be effected.
-P-A-G-E-742
  724 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
One crisis has been successfully passed at no small cost to 
the administration. Other difficult problems are pressing hard 
for solution. A second storm must break, if the question of 
the assignment of kindergarten teachers is again raised. 
Assignment 
With the circumstances as they are given above would you 
propose the further saving which can be asked by requiring 
all kindergarten teachers to teach two sessions daily and two 
separate groups of children? 
Is there any reason to be found in the kindergarten program 
which justifies the proposal that kindergarten teachers should 
have school time assigned for the preparation of the next day’s 
work? 
What differentiation, if any, would you make in the assign- 
ment of kindergarten and first grade teachers? 
What is the current practice throughout the United States 
with respect to the assignment of kindergarten teachers?

PROBLEM 111 
THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 
Problem: To discover the position which an elementary school 
principal should hold in the administration of a public school 
system. 
Riverton, N. K., is a city of 30,000 people, with a school 
population of 6,500. The school system consists of a high 
school of 1,000 pupils and twelve elementary schools. The 
elementary schools have the following number of teachers, 
including the principals:

  The school system includes a Board of Education of nine 
members, organized with a president and seven standing com- 
mittees as follows: Executive, finance, teachers, visiting, 
school examinations, farm school, and building. 
The school staff includes a superintendent who has his office 
in the City Hall, two clerks, music supervisor, drawing super- 
visor, physical training director with an assistant, two school 
nurses, an attendance officer, a night school staff, and a con- 
tinuation school director. Each building has a janitor who 
works under the direction of a head janitor who has no definite 
office. The supervisors, school nurses, and attendance officer 
make their headquarters in the outer office of the superin- 
tendent. No special desks are provided for them. ‘ 
Seven of the elementary schools are organized with depart- 
mental teachers in the sixth, seventh and eighth grades. Five 
schools include only the first six grades. 
Each principal has an office with a desk. The office is 
located in most instances on the second floor. In the case of a 
725 
 
-P-A-G-E-744
  726 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
comparatively new building, the office is on the second floor at 
the rear of the auditorium stage. No principal has a clerk. 
No office has a typewriter or mimeograph. A small duplicator 
is provided. No filing devices are provided. The telephone is 
connected with the central of the city system. 
Every principal is expected to do some teaching. One prin- 
cipal prefers to spend two hours a day out of school as visit- 
ing teacher or assistant attendance officer. Another prefers to 
help pupils individually. One principal, with twelve teachers, 
spends four periods (half day) in teaching. One principal, 
with seven teachers, has six periods of teaching and two periods 
of supervised study so that she does not have time for 
visiting. 
Five of the principals have flourishing parent-teacher as- 
sociations. No other form of community organization is at- 
tempted. 
Teacher meetings are held as needed, averaging one a month. 
These meetings are devoted largely to routine matters. At 
times, methods of teaching are discussed, such as reading and 
penmanship. One principal attempts to get his teachers to 
meet by grades with the teachers of the other schools. 
The principals have no voice in the selection of teachers. If 
a principal protests strongly enough, she may be able to keep 
a teacher known to her as undesirable from being assigned to 
her building. A principal may determine the number of hours 
of teaching for any teacher and may reassign a teacher, with 
the approval of the superintendent, if she thinks the teacher is 
unfitted for the grade to which she was originally appointed. 
A principal gives the superintendent once a year an estimate 
of the worth of the teachers in her building. A rank of “poor” 
does not mean that the teacher in question will necessarily be 
dismissed at the end of the year. A rank of “good” may mean 
that the superintendent will visit the teacher in question and 
later confer with the principal concerning the retention of the 
teacher. The principals seem to be well satisfied with their 
teachers. 
Twice a year each principal receives from the superintendent 
a form for requisition of supplies. Considerable choice is 
given, as to kind of pen, ruling of paper, size of paper, type of 
kindergarten material,. etc. Additional supplies may be
-P-A-G-E-745
PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 727 
obtained by order of the superintendent and approval of the 
chairman of the visiting committee, provided the allotment of 
the school for supplies has not been exceeded. No principal 
has a contingent fund allowed by the Board of Education. 
Principals are able to supply their schools in emergencies from 
funds collected through parent-teacher associations or from 
entertainments. No accounting is made of these funds. The 
principals seem well satisfied with the quantity and quality of 
the supplies. 
Principals may select books from a list sent out by the su- 
perintendent, or may request the purchase of other books, if 
they keep within the amount allowed the school. Such free- 
dom exists that it is difficult to maintain a uniform list of 
textbooks throughout the system. The principals agreed to 
use a certain speller but not all principals have complied with 
this agreement. The principals express satisfaction in the 
adoption of a basic reader after an investigation lasting for 
four years. 
The principals have no authority to order repairs of build- 
ings. They await the repair of leaky roofs or defective plumb- 
ing at the convenience and discretion of the head janitor. 
The principals feel at liberty to supplement the printed 
course of study. The state course of study is followed to a 
large extent. No principal has supplied her teachers with 
mimeographed outlines. A few teachers still use a commercial 
arithmetic outline prepared by a committee of principals and 
teachers several years ago. Similarly an old outline in 
language work exists here and there in the schools. No con- 
sistent attempt is being made to develop a local course of 
study. Several principals feel the need of a codrdinating 
force, such as an assistant superintendent or grade supervisor, 
for this purpose. 
Principals have authority to classify and promote pupils. 
One principal feels handicapped in the attitude of the super- 
intendent which discourages special promotions. Pupils living 
outside the boundaries of the school must obtain transfer cards 
from the superintendent before admission. One principal ac- 
cepts pupils who live within the school boundaries, another 
requires a transfer card in any case. No principal seems able 
to recall an instance in which the Visiting Committee had
-P-A-G-E-746

exercised the power given to it by the rules to direct the pro- 
motion of pupils.

PROBLEM 112 
TEACHER TENURE 
Problem: Do you believe that the tenure of teachers should 
be established by law? If so, what should be the provision of 
the statute? 
The superintendent of schools of the city of Attica has been 
acting as a member of a committee of the State Teachers’ As- 
sociation appointed for the purpose of developing a state law 
for teacher tenure. The committee has met from time to time 
and the result of these meetings based upon the work of the 
committee and its advisers is the following bill which it is 
proposed shall be presented to the Senate and House of 
Representatives. 
AN ACT 
To amend sections one thousand one hundred and five 
and one thousand one hundred and seven of the act ap- 
proved the nineteenth day of June, one thousand nine hun- 
dred and fourteen, (P. L. 218), entitled “An act to estab- 
lish a public school system in the State of N. K., together 
with the provisions by which it shall be administered, and 
prescribing penalties for the violation thereof; providing 
revenue to establish and maintain the same, and the method 
of collecting such revenue; and repealing all laws, general, 
special or local, or any parts thereof, that are or may be 
inconsistent therewith:” providing for the employment and 
dismissal of teachers, principals, supervisors, directors of 
special subjects, and supervising principals. 
Section 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Repre- 
sentatives of the State of N. K. in General Assembly met and it is 
hereby enacted by the authority of the same: That section one thou- 
sand one hundred and five of the act approved the nineteenth day 
of June, one thousand nine hundred and fourteen, (P. L. 218), en- 
titled “An act to establish a public school system in the State of 
N. K., together with the provisions by which it shall be admin- 
734
-P-A-G-E-753
   PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 735 
istered, and prescribing penalties for the violation thereof; providing 
revenue to establish and maintain the same, and the method of 
collecting such revenues and repealing all laws, general, special or 
local, or any parts thereof, that are or may be inconsistent there- 
with,” is hereby amended to read as follows: 
Section 1105. (Teachers of merit and experience, who held 
State certificates which exempt their holders from further examina- 
tion, may be elected for any length of time not exceeding three 
years.) 
(1) The word “teacher,” as used in this section, means any per- 
son holding a standard certificate or the equivalent employed in the 
public school system of this State as a duly qualified teacher, 
principal, supervisor, director of a special subject, or supervising 
principal. 
(2) Any such teacher employed by any board of school directors 
for services during the school year of 1925-26, or any school year 
thereafter, shall serve for one year on probation, and such period 
of probation may be extended to three years by the board of school 
directors upon the written recommendation of the county or district 
superintendent; but no teacher shall be elected for more than three 
consecutive years as a teacher on probation, provided that teachers 
who have been granted indefinite tenure under existing regulations 
in any school district of the State shall be considered as satisfying 
the probationary requirements of this act. 
(3) Any teacher who during the period of probation, as herein- 
before provided, rendered satisfactory services shall be reémployed 
by the board of school directors for the school term immediately 
following such period of probation, for an indefinite term under a 
continuing contract, which may be terminated only in the manner 
hereinafter provided in clause (4a) or clause (4b) of this section 
or in section 1107 of said act as amended by this act. 
(4a) Any teacher serving for an indefinite term under a con- 
tinuing contract, whose work at any time is judged to be unsatis- 
factory, may, upon the written recommendation of the district or 
county superintendent, be placed, by a majority vote of the whole 
board of directors, on a one-year probationary tenure at the end 
of any one-half year period of a school year; and the contract of 
any such teacher, who has so served on probation for one year, and 
whose work continues unsatisfactory, may be cancelled by the 
majority vote of the whole board, but only after such a teacher has 
‘been served with a thirty days’ written notice of the charges made 
against her or him and has been given an opportunity to be heard. 
Only such directors as have heard the entire evidence shall be eli- 
gible to vote on the question of dismissal. No evidence shall be  
-P-A-G-E-754
  736 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
heard by the board at any time unless notice has been served upon 
such teacher of the time and place of such hearing, and an opportu- 
nity afforded such teacher to be present at such hearing. 
(4b) The contract of any teacher serving for an indefinite term 
under a continuing contract may also be cancelled, and such teacher 
be dismissed without placing him or her on a probationary period, 
where written charges of unsatisfactory work, supported or unsup- 
ported, by the recommendation of the county or district superin- 
tendent, are made against such teacher; but no such contract shall 
be cancelled, or teacher be dismissed, except by a two-thirds vote of 
the whole board, and only after such teacher has been served with 
a thirty days’ written notice of the charges made against him or 
her and has been given an opportunity to be heard. Only such 
school members as have heard the entire evidence shall be eligible 
to vote upon the question of dismissal. No evidence shall be heard 
by the board at any time unless notice has been served upon such 
teacher of the time and place of such hearing and an opportunity 
afforded to such teacher to be present at such hearing. 
(5) Nothing in this section shall interfere with or prevent any 
board of school directors from assigning, transferring or reassigning 
a teacher from one department or grade to another department or 
grade, unless such transfer, assignment or reassignment results 
in a reduction of the teacher’s salary, in which case the teacher shall 
be entitled to a full and fair hearing after proper notice. Only the 
directors who heard all the evidence in the case shall vote on the 
question of assigning, transferring, or reassigning a teacher in cases 
involving a reduction of salary. 
(6) Nothing in this section shall be construed as interfering with 
the retirement of teachers from service as provided in the Public 
School Employees Retirement Law. 
Section 2. That section one thousand one hundred and seven of 
said act is hereby amended to read as follows: 
Section 1107. Any principal or teacher employed in any school 
district may be dismissed, at any time, by the board of school 
directors, on account of immorality, (incompetency), intemperance, 
cruelty, negligence, or for the violation of any of the provisions of 
this act: (Provided, That before any principal or teacher is dis- 
missed he shall be given an opportunity to be heard, after reason- 
able notice in writing of the charges made against him,) but no 
such teacher shall be dismissed except by a majority vote of the 
whole board, and only after he or she has been served with a thirty 
days’ written notice of the charges made against him or her, and 
has been given an opportunity to be heard. Only such school 
members as have heard the entire evidence shall be eligible to vote
-P-A-G-E-755
PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 737 
on the question of dismissal. No evidence shall be heard by the 
board at any time unless notice has been served upon such teacher 
of the time and place of such hearing, and an opportunity afforded 
to such teacher to be present at such hearing. 
On receiving copies of the Bill, the superintendent presented 
a copy to the legal counsellor of his local Board of Education. 
The counsellor rendered legal advice as follows: 
Superintendent of Schools 
Attica, N. K. 
My pear SUPERINTENDENT: 
I have your letter of the 19th inst., enclosing proposed Teachers’ 
Tenure Bill. 
The propriety of such a law must primarily and necessarily hang 
on the question—how will it affect the children? Will it tend to 
raise, maintain or lower the amount of knowledge acquired by the 
pupils? 
The harm resulting from the retention of an incompetent teacher, 
even during the thirty days, which, under the Bill, must elapse be- 
tween charges and trial, is simply incalculable and absolutely 
irremediable. 
The principle “Safety First” should be strictly applied. The 
interest of the child overwhelms any, and every other interest. 
Every doubt should be resolved in his favor. 
From the viewpoint of this School Board, the Bill is—ist: un- 
necessary; 2nd: impracticable; 3rd: impossible. 
As to the first proposition, it is needless to say that our teachers 
have no cause of complaint. In my position as legal adviser of the 
Board since its organization, I have not heard, or heard of, a single 
complaint of injustice to a teacher. It is axiomatic that such a 
statute is justified only when there is “an evil to be remedied.” 
As to impracticability, the Board of Education is composed of 
seven directors; all men of affairs who freely contribute their time 
and energies in the cause of education. The Bill would so increase 
the burden of duty that it is hard to conceive that an able man 
would accept appointment. 
Further, when a teaching staff in any city approaches one thou- 
sand or more, a serious problem develops. 
It might well be that ten, twenty or thirty cases might arise within 
a short period and the disposition thereof might well take the 
entire time of the Board for two or three months. During that 
time, the Board would be a Court—not an Executive organization. 
If there were “an evil” to be remedied, this particular objection
-P-A-G-E-756
  738 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
would be weakened. If, and when, the evil of unjust dismissal of 
teachers arises, a remedy may be readily found and applied. 
As to impossibility—the imperative provision that a hearing be 
had in all cases, involves a trial and the reception of all evidence 
offered. This might, and almost certainly would, mean a trial 
extending over many days—or many weeks. 
In view of the requirement that “only the Board members who 
heard all the evidence in the case” may vote and that four affirma- 
tive votes are required, not less than six of the seven directors would 
have to be continuously present and hear every word of the testi- 
mony. Even a margin of two would not, in a protracted hearing, 
avoid the danger of a mistrial. 
The vice of the Bill may well be illustrated by a hypothetical 
case—A teacher’s work becomes unsatisfactory to the Superin- 
tendent; a charge is preferred and evidence of the Principal and 
Superintendent taken. The teacher then has the right to call every 
one of her pupils and their parents, guardians and near relations to 
testify as to their non-expert opinion. In his several classes, a 
teacher may have over a hundred pupils—they may all be called 
and interrogated. These pupils may have two hundred parents, 
guardians and near relations—they may all be called and inter- 
rogated. The Board may not refuse to hear even one of them. 
Yours very truly, 
Joun Doz, 
Attorney to Board of Education 
Assignment 
1. Is the tenure act as it has been developed by the commit- 
tee in this state a proper one for the state to adopt? 
2. In what way does this tenure act conflict with present 
tenure practices in such states as New Jersey, California and 
the city of Washington, D. C.? 
3. Indicate the effect which tenure has upon administrative 
practice with respect to the selection of teachers. 
4. How has tenure operated to influence the selection and 
probationary period of teachers in states where teacher tenure 
has already been enacted into law? 
5. What should be the attitude of the superintendent of 
schools in the light of the legal advice which has been given 
him by the local attorney? 
6. Draft a law providing for tenure in such form as to in-

  PROBLEM 113 
PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 
Problem: A bulletin issued by the Board of Education of 
Liverpool, N. K., carries information for teachers and for ap- 
plicants for new positions. Among other items are the fol- 
lowing covering uniform procedure on certification, election 
and assignment, classification, leave of absence and salary pay- 
ments. The superintendent of schools finds it necessary to 
revise these statements for the revision of this bulletin as many 
perplexing problems have arisen in the interpretation of the 
rules as they have appeared. 
Certification 
No person may begin teaching in the public schools until the 
proper certificate has been placed on file with the superintendent 
of schools. 
Election and Assignment 
Applicants for nomination to positions in the Liverpool Public 
Schools should secure and file the blanks used in receiving applica- 
tions. After this step has been completed, personal interviews 
should be held with the various supervisors who may be concerned 
with the applicant’s ability, with the principals who may have 
need for the applicant’s services, with the research department, and 
with the superintendent. Information as to how to reach the 
various persons who should be interviewed may be had at the In- 
formation Bureau of the Board of Education. 
All new teachers whose services are found desirable are recom- 
mended by the superintendent of schools to the Board of Education 
for appointment at scheduled salaries subject to assignment by the 
superintendent of schools. Credit for equivalent experience else- 
where is always allowed. 
After a regular appointment has once been secured, all members 
of the teaching staff are automatically reélected from year to year 
unless otherwise notified before the tenth day of June. Continu- 
ance in service does not, however, carry with it a guarantee of con- 
tinuance in the same position from year to year. Transfers and 
740 
 
-P-A-G-E-759
  PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 741 
reassignments must be made according to the judgment of those 
responsible. 
Classification 
Teachers are classified as permanent, probationary, or substitute. 
A permanent teacher is one who has been successfully employed 
by the district for two consecutive years at the time of classifica- 
tion. A probationary teacher is one who has not yet become a 
permanent teacher. 
A substitute teacher is a teacher who has been employed to teach 
from day to day for less than a school year to fill a position of a 
regularly employed teacher absent from service. 
Leave of Absence 
The Board’s policy in the matter of granting leaves of absences 
on account of ill health or to minister to the teacher’s professional 
improvement is conservatively liberal. No teacher may withdraw 
from service during the year either by resignation or upon leave of 
absence except permission is granted by the Board of Education 
following a written request by the teacher to the Board. Any 
teacher on leave must notify the Board of Education at least sixty 
days before the expiration of his leave as to whether he intends to 
return to active service at the expiration of the leave. Unless such 
notice is received by the Board of Education, it is considered that 
the person is not returning to service and that official relations are 
dissolved. Except in case of illness, a leave of absence will be 
granted to permanent teachers only. 
Salaries 
Salaries are paid according to the schedule adopted annually by 
the Board of Education. Salaries are paid in twelve equal install- 
ments, payable on the first day of each calendar month, except that 
teachers now in the schools are not paid the first or second salary 
installments until actual teaching has begun. 
Assignment 
1. Wherein lies the value of the rule on certification? 
2. How has your past administrative policy with reference 
to the selection of teachers varied from the plan followed 
here? Has this plan such outstanding merit that you would 
recommend it for extensive adoption? 
8. Develop what you consider to be a satisfactory applica- 
tion form.
-P-A-G-E-760
  742 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
4. Outline the nature and content of a personal interview 
between: (a) A third-grade teacher and the superintendent. 
(b) An elementary principal and the superintendent. (c) A 
physical education director and the superintendent. (d) An 
elementary supervisor and a fourth-grade teacher. 
5. After a candidate has been interviewed by three or four 
members of the staff, what plan of securing a group rating 
should be followed? 
6. Outline the advantages accruing from automatic vs. 
annual reélection. 
7. From the standpoint of the profession, is life tenure to 
be preferred to that outlined in these regulations? What are 
the advantages and disadvantages of life tenure? 
8. Would it be desirable to include in these regulations the 
frequently found condition that “no teachers will be engaged 
except as they present evidence of two years’ successful 
experience”? 
9. Is the “conservatively liberal” policy with respect to leave 
of absence sufficiently definite to prevent misunderstanding? 
What has been the practice in other cities? 
10. What is gained through payment of teachers on a 
twelve-months’ basis? Does this tend toward too much pater- 
nalism on the part of the administration? Have you any 
defense for the bi-monthly payment plan?

TEACHER TENURE 
Problem: How shall the teacher’s tenure of office be made less 
precarious, and our schools be assured of the continuous serv- 
ice of good teachers for a series of years? * 
I. Teacher Turnover in the United States: 
A. Amount in elementary and secondary schools as revealed by 
a nation-wide survey in 1924: 
1. In 1922-1923 the state turnover, ie., the number of 
teachers required to fill positions vacated by teachers 
leaving the profession in each state, totaled 110,560 or 
16 per cent of the entire teaching profession. It ranged 
from 4 per cent in Florida to 47 per cent in Wyoming. 
2. Median tenure in the public schools of the United States 
is 4 years; the median tenure in rural schools is 2 years. 
3. The tenure of superintendents of schools in the United 
States is 3 years. 
B. Political Dismissals: 
1. There are flagrant examples of where schools suffer from 
politics and gross favoritism. 
II. Tenure Laws and Regulations: 
"A. State Teacher Tenure Laws: 
These eleven states have enacted teacher tenure laws: 
California, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, New York, Oregon 
and Wisconsin. 
B. Local Tenure Regulations: 
In 1924, local tenure regulations were in effect in one or 
more cities or towns in twenty-two different states.

over a year, and with all the uncertainties of an annual election 
constantly facing them ”? 
4, Will the enactment of tenure laws result in lowered teach-

PROBLEM 115 
PARTICIPATION OF TEACHERS IN THE ADMINISTRA- 
TION OF SCHOOLS 
Problem: At the request of the teachers of the schools of 
Academia, N. K., a teachers’ council has been organized. This 
council is made up of (1) the teachers in each school building 
who meet for conference on the problems occurring in that 
unit of the school system, (2) of representatives of the work- 
ers in each general group in the school system, such as kinder- 
gartners, primary teachers, intermediate teachers, junior and 
senior high school teachers and supervisors. In the case of 
each school group the principal of the building has been in- 
structed to present matters concerning the revision of courses 
of study, the development of new methods of teaching, major 
problems of discipline, the relation of the school to the com- 
munity, the issues that center around extra-curricular activi- 
ties, the assignment of teachers to special work, and the like, 
to the school building council. 
There has been an assumption on the part of teachers that 
where a majority voted in favor of a particular policy their 
recommendation would be carried to the superintendent of 
schools and through him to the Board of Education for action. 
Your high school principal has found difficulty in meeting the 
expectation of his teachers in this regard. 
The high school in question has a faculty of fifteen teachers. 
They range in experience from a very capable teacher of 
mathematics of thirty years of experience to two young women 
who are having their first year of teaching experience. The 
principal has had ten years of experience in this field of work 
and has demonstrated his ability to handle a high school. He 
is particularly strong in his work with boys. The principal 
believes in the organization of his faculty for participation in 
745 
 
-P-A-G-E-764
746 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
the work of determining the policy which shall prevail in the 
school. 
The case which is causing difficulty and which has raised 
the issue which the principal of the high school has presented 
to you and upon which he asks for a ruling from the Board 
of Education is one involving three boys who have violated the 
regulation against smoking in the school building. The school 
has had much difficulty in enforcing this regulation and the 
whole faculty are agreed as to the importance of continuing 
the regulation in effect. 
There is no doubt as to the guilt of the boys. They have 
been called in and given a chance to answer questions and 
have been frank in their statement of the case. A discussion 
has been held by the faculty on the question of their suspen- 
sion from school. The proposal to suspend them, advocated 
most vigorously by one of the men of the faculty, has been 
carried by a small majority. 
The principal believes that a different procedure would be 
more likely to prove helpful to the boys and would not harm 
the morale of the school. In the discussion in the faculty 
meeting he strongly advocated that the boys be denied certain 
privileges which they valued highly, rather than that they be 
excluded from the school. He now thinks that the welfare 
of the boys is more important than the preservation of the 
principle, “majority rule,” in the faculty of the high school. 
Assignment 
1. How would you meet the situation which the high school 
principal has presented? 
2. How should a teachers’ council be organized? 
3. What powers should the council, or any division of it, 
have in matters of administration? Should a council ever 
have anything more than advisory power? 
4. Should the representatives of teachers’ councils appear 
before boards of education, or should their recommendations 
always be submitted by the superintendent of schools? 
5. Would you favor the enactment of a law by the state 
legislature requiring boards of education to recognize teachers’ 
councils and to set aside stated meetings during the year at 
which they could be heard?

6. How would you hope to have the teachers’ council, or 
any division of it, utilize expert opinion when initiating or 
recommending policies for the school system?

PROBLEM 116 
ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
Problem: There are scores of situations confronting the super- 
intendent of schools which involve ethical considerations. The 
question is not one of some special technique employed, but 
rather of the code of conduct which should cover the action 
of a professional worker. A number of such cases are listed 
below. 
1. As superintendent of schools in City “X,” you have 
served two years of a second four-year contract, salary $4,000. 
City “Y” offering larger professional opportunities, indefinite 
tenure and a salary of $6,000 invites you to the superintend- 
ency. City “X” declines to release you. What would you do? 
2. The Board of Education of City “F” has dismissed the 
superintendent of schools, a highly respected professionally 
minded man, for reasons which they refuse to make public. 
The Board of Education invites you to fill the position. What 
would be your answer? 
8. Your Board of Education insists upon the dismissal of five 
teachers that you have recommended for reélection for rea- 
sons that, in your judgment, are unwarranted. What would 
you do? 
4. You are occupying a desirable superintendency in City 
“A.” You have heard it rumored at the Superintendents’ 
Convention that Superintendent Jones of City “B” was uncer- 
tain of reélection. You would prefer the superintendency of 
City “B” to that of City “A.” What would you do? 
5. Mr. Brown has been assistant superintendent in City “R” 
for ten years. He was a strong candidate for the superin- 
tendency when you were elected. You are told by your sup- 
porters that he will attempt to undermine your administration. 
What attitude will you take in handling this situation?

PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 749 
6. Mr. Hall, the principal of your high school, with your 
approval has been asked to resign because of general incom- 
petency. He is a man forty years old with large family re- 
sponsibilities—two children in college, an invalid wife and 
two children in the home. His resources are limited to his 
salary. He has applied for the principalship of a high school 
in a neighboring state, used your name as a reference and 
his election depends upon your letter. Write the letter. 
7. Your election to a large superintendency is conditioned 
upon the support of a certain textbook publishing company 
that has been the recipient of large patronage in that par- 
ticular city for many years. A representative of the company 
confers with you regarding the situation offering the support 
of the company. What would you tell him? 
8. As superintendent of schools, you have come into pos- 
session of strong circumstantial evidence that the president of 
your board, who is your strongest supporter, is in collusion 
with contractors and supply houses receiving personal gain 
through the patronage he is able to deliver. What would 
you do? 
9. You are superintendent of schools in Phoenix. At Christ- 
mas time you receive by express a package containing a hand- 
some traveling bag. In it you find a card of a man who, 
through years of professional association, has become a close 
personal friend. He is the official representative of a promi- 
nent book company. What would you do with the travel- 
ing bag? : 
10. You are on the staff of a school of education. A map 
publishing company approaches you offering to finance you in 
a research to the extent of $5,000 upon the relative value of 
the several kinds of school maps now on the market. What 
would your answer be? 
11. You are asked by a teachers’ agency to report vacancies 
in your school system. This agency hopes that you will 
employ teachers recommended by them. They receive a fee 
from every teacher that you employ amounting to five per cent 
of the teacher’s salary. In the letter asking for your codpera- 
tion the blank shown (page 750) was enclosed. Would you 
patronzie this agency? If so, why? If not, why not?

12. The principal of an elementary school in your city has 
been unjustly accused of unprofessional conduct. You are 
confident from the evidence which you have been able to 
secure that he is not guilty. The public has been aroused to 
demand the dismissal of this man from his position. The 
members of the Board are inclined to accede to this clamor 
even though they are not convinced of his guilt. A part of 
the evidence did not appear when the matter was before the 
Board for consideration. What would your response be to such 
a demand? 
13. In the community in which you are working there have 
developed very bitter hostilities between two important social 
groups. The one that has a majority of the members of the 
Board of Education affiliated with it insists that you become 
an active member. What would your response be to such a 
demand? 
14. The most influential member of your Board of Educa- 
tion asks that you appoint to a position in the high school a 
teacher in whose welfare he has a personal interest. This 
teacher has the qualifications required by law and by the rules 
of the Board of Education. He is not, however, in your judg- 
ment as good a teacher as is another applicant who has no 
local affiliations. Which teacher would you recommend for 
appointment and how would you present the matter to your 
Board of Education? 
The Hippocratic Oath Administered to Physicians 
I will adopt that system of regimen which, according to my 
ability and judgment, I consider for the benefit of my patients,
-P-A-G-E-769
  PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 751 
and will protect them from everything noxious and injurious. With 
purity and with holiness I will pass my life and practice my art. 
. . . Into whatever houses I enter I will go into them for the benefit 
of the sick, keeping myself aloof from every voluntary act of in- 
justice and corruption and lust. Whatever in the course of my 
professional practice, or outside of it, I see or hear which ought 
not to be spread abroad, I will not divulge, as reckoning that all 
such should be kept secret. If I continue to observe this oath and 
keep it inviolate, may it be mine to enjoy life and the practice of 
the Art respected among all men for ever. But should I violate 
this oath and forswear myself, may the reverse be my lot.” 
Code of Professional Ethics for Utah Teachers 
1. Teaching is a profession that merits the utmost loyalty—I will 
undertake my work whole-heartedly and enthusiastically as a busi- 
ness worthy of the best efforts of the most capable—a commend- 
able life work in itself, not a temporary makeshift. I will make no 
apologies for my profession, nor will I disgrace it by seeking a 
position for which I am not scholastically and professionally 
prepared. 
2. In teaching, above all professions, growth is essential to life: 
stagnation is death—I will keep abreast of social progress—in touch 
with the advancement of vital human interests. I will employ 
every available means of growing professionally; reading the 
best books and magazines, attendance at teachers’ institutes and 
conventions, and affiliation with professional educational organiza- 
tions—local, state, and national. 
3. In any profession service is more important than material 
reward—As a teacher I will endeavor at all times to render the 
highest quality of service I am able to give, regardless of the com- 
pensation I may receive. 
4. Codperation is essential to progress—I will cultivate in the 
highest degree a spirit of helpfulness and professional courtesy to- 
ward the whole educational staff—fellow teachers and administra- 
tors. I will do nothing to undermine an associate’s influence for 
good or to hinder his professional growth. I will not apply for a 
position that is not vacant, or by any other means seek to displace 
a fellow member of the profession; nor will I lower the standards 
of the profession or of a district by underbidding the salary 
schedule. 
5. A teacher should possess an appropriate personality—Schools 
exist for the children; the teacher who is a pessimist, a grouch, or a 
eynic has no legitimate place in the schoolroom. Believing in the
-P-A-G-E-770
752 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
possibilities for good in developing humanity, but also not blind to 
the pitfalls of evil, my attitude toward children will be sympathetic, 
but not irrational; kind, but not coddling; and permeated withal, 
with a saving sense of humor. 
6. A teacher should be absolutely dependable—I will respect the 
terms and the spirit of every contract I enter into, whether verbal 
or written. I will never fail to meet every daily appointment or 
other obligation, except for unavoidable causes. In such cases I will 
promptly notify the proper authorities. 
7. A teacher should be truly patriotic—As a good citizen I will 
participate in the activities of the community, especially in those 
activities that have to do with the protection and betterment of the 
immature. I believe in my country and its ideals of equality of 
opportunity and liberty under law. I believe also in humanity and 
will seek always to promote justice and good will. 
8. A teacher should be both reverent and tolerant—I will have 
reverence for all that is good. I will respect as sacred the right of 
each individual to his own faith and worship. This is also my own 
right, but I will not seek to impose my religious faith or form of 
worship upon the pupils. 
Code of Ethics for Michigan Teachers 
1. A teacher should actively affiliate with professional organiza- 
tions of teachers and should become acquainted with the proceed- 
ings of the state associations. (The principal professional organiza- 
tions for classroom teachers are the National Education Associa- 
tion, the Michigan State Teachers’ Association, the Schoolmasters’ 
Club, and certain county and local organizations. School authori-, 
ties should encourage active participation in certain of these or- 
ganizations by all teachers.) 
2. A clear understanding of the law of contracts is incumbent 
upon a teacher. Since a teacher should scrupulously keep whatever 
agreement is made, he should refuse to sign a contract unjust and 
humiliating in form. (A teacher should ask such questions as: 
a. Does the contract provide sufficient salary as indicated in 
Article 3? 
b. What provision is made for terminating this contract? Is this 
provision fair to both teacher and board of education? 
c. Does the contract cover the essential items as defined by the 
superintendent of public instruction? (See School Law, re- 
vision of 1919, p. 281.) 
3. It is unprofessional for a teacher to sign a yearly contract to 
teach for a wage that is not sufficient to cover living expenses for 
twelve months. (According to the resolutions of the Michigan
-P-A-G-E-771
  PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 753 
State Teachers’ Association in Grand Rapids, 1920, the minimum 
salary for any teacher should be sufficient to cover living expenses 
for twelve months, plus three hundred dollars for savings. To 
determine living expenses for twelve months, the cost of board, 
room, laundry, and street-car fare, in the community where the 
teacher is employed, should be taken as representing fifty-two and 
one-half per cent of the total living expenses for the year.) 
4. It is unprofessional for a teacher to resign unless his contract 
provides for release on giving of proper notice. 
5. It is unprofessional for a teacher to underbid knowingly a rival 
in order to secure a position. It is expected that a teacher will verify 
a rumor of a vacancy before filing an application. In a graded 
school, application should be filed with the superintendent. 
6. It is unprofessional for a teacher to tutor pupils of his own 
classes for remuneration except by special permission of the school 
authorities. 
7. It is unprofessional for a teacher to absent himself from school 
or to call in or allow the use of a substitute except for serious illness 
or for other grave reasons. 
8. It is unprofessional for a teacher to measure his duties and 
responsibilities to the pupils, or to the school or to the community, 
in terms of financial rewards. 
9. Since teachers are rightly regarded as examples to pupils, a 
teacher should so conduct himself that no just reproach may be 
brought against him. Where liberty of conscience is not concerned, 
a teacher should stand ready to make personal sacrifice, because of 
the prejudices of a community, 
10. It is unprofessional for a superintendent or other school 
official to offer a position to a teacher under contract without first 
determining the willingness of the teacher’s employer to grant a 
release. ju lis Mlahiliaisiaeodare inh — iho lo! 
11. It is unprofessional for a dsuperintendent to refuse to aid a 
successful teacher to secure worthy promotion within his own or 
another school system. (It is the opinion of the Committee on 
Professional Ethics that the surest way to attract and retain 
superior men and women in the teaching profession, is for superin- 
tendents to aid such teachers in the securing of worthy promotions 
within their own or another school system.) 
12. It is unprofessional for teachers to criticise co-laborers or 
predecessors in the presence of pupils or patrons. Such procedure 
tends to injure the school and to weaken the confidence in which 
the work of teachers is held by the public. 
13. Teachers should be ready at all times to assist one another 
by giving information, counsel and advice and by such services and
-P-A-G-E-772
  754 PROBLEMS IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION 
acts as teachers can perform without detriment to themselves or 
their work. Such reasonable service should be regarded as a pro- 
fessional duty for which remuneration beyond actual expenses 
should not be accepted. 
The Lawyer’s Duty in Its Last Analysis 
From Canons of Professional Ethics adopted by the American Bar Associa- 
tion at its Thirty-first Annual Meeting at Seattle, Washington, on August 
27, 1908. Reports of American Bar Association Vol XLIX 1924. 
“No client, corporate or individual, however powerful, nor any 
cause, civil or political, however important, is entitled to receive nor 
should any lawyer render any service or advice involving disloyalty 
to the law whose ministers we are, or disrespect of the judicial office, 
which we are bound to uphold, or corruption of any person or per- 
sons exercising a public office or private trust, or deception or 
betrayal of the public. When rendering any such improper service 
or advice, the lawyer invites and merits stern and just condemna- 
tion. Correspondingly, he advances the honor of his profession and 
the best interests of his client when he renders service or gives advice 
tending to impress upon the client and his undertaking exact com- 
pliance with the strictest principles of moral law. He must also 
observe and advise his client to observe the statute law, though 
until a statute shall have been construed and interpreted by compe- 
tent adjudication, he is free and is entitled to advise as to its 
validity and as to what he conscientiously believes to be its just 
meaning and extent. But above all a lawyer will find his highest 
honor in a deserved reputation for fidelity to private trust and to 
public duty, as an honest man and as a patriotic and loyal citizen. 
Oath of Admission. “The general principles which should ever 
control the lawyer in the practice of his profession are clearly set 
forth in the following Oath of Admission to the Bar, formulated 
upon that in use in the State of Washington, and which conforms in 
its main outlines to the “duties” of lawyers as defined by statutory 
enactments in that and many other States of the Union—duties 
which they are sworn on admission to obey and for the wilful viola- 
tion of which disbarment is provided: 
“I DO SOLEMNLY SWEAR: 
I will support the Constitution of the United States and the Con- 
stitution of the State of ————————— 
I will maintain the respect due to Courts of Justice and Judicial 
officers; 
I will not counsel or maintain any suit or proceeding which shall 
 
-P-A-G-E-773
  PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 155 
appear to me to be unjust, nor any defense except such as I believe 
to be honestly debatable under the law of the land; 
I will employ for the purpose of maintaining the causes confided 
to me such means only as are consistent with truth and honor, and 
will never seek to mislead the Judge or jury by any artifice or false 
statement of fact or law; 
I will maintain the confidence and preserve inviolate the secrets 
of my client, and will accept no compensation in connection with 
his business except from or with his knowledge and approval; 
I will abstain from all offensive personality, and advance no fact 
prejudicial to the honor or reputation of a party or witness, unless 
required by the justice of the cause with which I am charged; 
I will never reject, from any consideration personal to myself, the 
cause of the defenseless or oppressed, or delay any man’s cause for 
lucre or malice. So HELP ME GOD. 
“We commend this form of oath for adoption by the proper 
authorities in all the States and Territories.” 
Assignment 
Prepare a brief embodying the principles which you consider 
should be included in a code of ethics for a superintendent of 
schools.

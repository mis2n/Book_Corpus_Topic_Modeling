PREFACE 
The Song Games in this book, as in the one preceding, have been sug- 
gested by the folksong airs upon which most of the music is based. Although 
definite suggestions accompany some of the songs, a free interpretation is in 
every case recommended. / 
I am very much indebted to Mr. F. H. Bisset for his great kindness in 
arranging the accompaniments.

Come guess where we’re going; 
We are marching, we are marching, 
We are off to the woods.

We hear the birds singing;

To the birds in the woods.

Under trees in the woods.

In the stream in the woods.

Wild flowers in the woods.

So softly, and sweetly;

Our song in the woods.

Our lunch in the woods.

LISTENING IN THE WOODS

So tired out and weary; 
We are sleeping, we are sleeping 
Like the babes in the wood.

To march away homewards; 
We are ready, we are ready, 
Goodbye to the woods. 
DIRECTIONS 
_ This song suggests the possibilities of a picnic in the woods, and affords opportunity for individual 
interpretation of the same action. Should there be a desire on the part of the children to sustain any 
action, the tune may be played over again on the piano, or hummed by the children, before proceeding to 
the next verse. :

HANDY ANDY, JACK A DANDY “3 
  GOOD DAY! 
1 Handy Andy, Jack a Dandy, 
Started for the fair; 
Marched along the road so gaily, 
With his head in air. 
To the people on the way 
He bowed and said “Good day.” 
Handy Andy, Jack a Dandy, 
Brave and bright and gay. bs Handy Andy, Jack a Dandy, 
Spent his pennies at the fair; 
Bought some “fairings” to take home 
To those who were not there. 
He heard the farmers tell 
How to buy and how to sell, 
Handy Andy, Jack a Dandy, 
Knew the market well. BUYING A FAIRING DANCING ON THE GREEN 
3 Handy Andy, Jack a Dandy, 
On the fair day might be seen 
With the other lads and lasses 
Dancing on the green. 
They raised a merry shout 
As they turned themselves about, 
Handy Andy, Jack a Dandy, 
“Dancing in and out. 
Handy Andy, Jack a Dandy; 
Left the fair at close of day; 
With his friends he sauntered homewards 
Chatting on’ the way. 
A finer lad than he ~ 
You never yet did see, 
Handy Andy, Jack a Dandy, 
He’s the boy for me! 
DIRECTIONS 
The personality of Handy Andy, Jack a Dandy, will appeal to the children as typical of a boy scout, al- 
ways happy and ready to be helpful, and trig and smart enough to be “dandy.”” Country children know all 
about the business of the fair and the fun of the fair; town children can imagine it. 
All the boys may be Handy Andys marching round in a ring. A group of girls may stand in the centre 
of the ring watching them, and ready to respond as they salute, purchase, or dance as the song suggests.

The “merry bound” of the last line may be accompanied by a clap of the hands.

DIRECTIONS | 
Any number of children form a ring, in 
little groups of three. Two clasp hands, form- 
inga swing. The third child stands in front of 
the swing, grasping the two wrists nearest him, 
ready to keep time as the swing moves forward 
and backwards for two bars of music. At the 
third bar all the singers step under the swing 
they have been using, and go forward in the 
same direction, to the next swing, catching it as 
    Sees aret| Repeat these two bars as often 
as necessary. 
  THE SWING IS READY 
it comes back on the second beat, and holding on for another bar before going forward to the next swing. 
This changing goes on until the last bar is reached when all the swingers remain slowly “dying” with the 
swing, repeating the word “dying” more and more slowly and softly, as the swing gradually comes to a stand- 
still. Next time, the swinger changes places with one of the stationary players. Again a change is made 
when the game is played a third time, so that every child may have his turn of swinging.

DIRECTIONS 
f Tn the first verse, the boys are the teachers, and emphasize the unwelcome instruction with a pointed 
orefinger. 
The girls reply by singing the remainder of the verse with gestures of remonstrance, which become quite 
pathetic at the last “‘dearie me!” 
In the second verse, the girls are the teachers, and the boys protest. 
In the third verse, they sing together, with an appreciation of the fun of make believe in the first two 
verses.

1 The little streamlet runs along, 
And as it runs, it sings a song, 
A happy, never ending song, 
It murmurs on its way. 
It tells of bridges, boats, and banks, 
Of little children playing pranks; 
‘Of trees and flowers that give it thanks; 
It murmurs on its way. 
2 The fishes through its waters glide; 
It’s sometimes narrow, sometimes wide; 
It has a bank on either side, 
It murmurs all the way. 
  It tells of mountains high and steep, 
Of shallow pools, and places deep, 
Of secrets that its shadows keep; 
It murmurs all the way. 
3 The streamlet never sleeps in bed, 
It’s very wide awake instead; 
It loves the moonbeams overhead, 
It murmurs all the way. 
It sometimes rushes very fast, 
It sometimes wanders slowly past, 
It means to reach the sea at last;

They wind in and out, passing under bridges (two children with clasped hands held up), sometimes 
flowing quickly down a hill, sometimes moving slowly along, according as the leader sets the pace. The 
suggestions in the song are such as commend themselves to the interest of little children in connection with 
the life story of a river. The song, as a whole, is intended for older children than those who would take part 
in the game. For them, a repetition of the first four lines, sung to the whole of the tune, would be sufficient.

We have crowned our Queen of the May; 
Set up the Maypole down on the green, — 
Deck it out to honor the Queen; 
Dancing around the Maypole high, 
Who is so gay as you and I? 
DIRECTIONS 
Once a year, on Mayday, some kind of 
decorated Maypole should be in evidence 
in playground or in classroom, and in keep- 
ing with the old-time spirit of merriment 
every little child should have his chance of 
holding a ribbon, and capering round the THE MAYPOLE 
pole as best he can. The older children, 
in their turn, may accomplish something more ambitious in the way of a Maypole dance. Each class may 
* choose its own queen by voting, and it is well to spring the ballot upon the children unexpectedly, so that they 
may have no opportunity for consultation with each other. The younger children, who cannot write, may 
whisper the name to the teacher and so may have their chosen queen, too. °

One, two, or three fairies stand up, and begin walking away from fairyland with slow steps, and’ sad 
looks. They walk to the farthest corner of the room while the fairies sing “ trudging down. ’ 
One, two, or three fairies stand up, talk together, run over to the “trudge-aways,” talk persuasively to 
them, take them by the hand and dance back with them to fairyland, while the fairies sing “ dancing up,” 
keeping time by clapping hands to express their pleasure. 
All stand and sing first verse again, dancing as before.

THE BABES IN THE WOOD 
  BABES IN THE WOOD 
The words here used are those of the traditional folksong which tells in rhyme a favourite old story. 
x My dears, you must know 
A long time ago 
That two little children 
Whose names I don’t know, 
Were stolen away one fine summer day, 
And lost in the woods as I’ve heard people say. 
Cuorus 
Poor babes in the wood, 
Poor babes in the wood, 
Oh, have you not heard of the babes in the wood! 
2 And when it was night, 
So sad was their plight; 
The sun it went down, 
And the moon gave no light. — 
They sobbed and they sighed and they bitterly cried, 
These two little babes, they lay down and died. Corus 
3 And when they were dead, 
The robins so red 
Brought beautiful leaves 
And all over them spread. : 
And all the day long, the branches among, 
They flew and they fluttered, and this was their song. CHorus

Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, a welcome to spring. Chitp, chirp, chirp, chirp, a welcome to spring. 
Birdies are singing from morning till night, Birdies are building a nest in a tree, 
Filling the air with a sound of delight. Making the cosiest home you could see; 
Birdies are happy, and busy, and bright, Soon will come baby birds, one, two, and three, 
Children are glad when the birds are in sight. Sing, little birdies, sing sweetly to me. 
3 Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, we hear the birds sing, 
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, a welcome to spring. 
Birdies are resting for night time is nigh, 
The moon and the stars keep a watch in the sky. 
Sleep, little birdies, on tree top so high, 
Hush-a-bye, hush-a-bye, hush-a-bye, bye. 
DIRECTIONS 
This spring song suggests a Nature game in which little children can impersonate the birds as they fly 
about, and sing, and build, and rest. .

qEN: MOD RF REbot EvENING AFTERNOON 
The time has now come for us all to part, 
Good afternoon we say; 
We run away home with a happy heart 
To meet another day. 
The daylight has faded to darkness deep, 
a Good night to one and all; 
May each of us rest in a quiet sleep 
Until the morning call.

Although of recent development, the idea 
of the junior high school as a distinct entity, 
as a new institution set apart in aims and 
methods from both grammar school and high 
school, is old enough to have demonstrated 
its value. But the junior high school move- 
ment in its inception was a scattered one; 
the peculiar problems that have arisen in 
connection with it have been met diversely ; 
and there has been considerable variance 
in aims and methods. As the movement 
grows, it becomes increasingly important 
to determine just what are the distinctive 
aims and methods of the junior high school, 
and what should be its program, its courses, 
and its equipment. To give a comprehensive 
view of this latest characteristic development 
in the organization of our public schools is 
the aim of Junior High School Education. 
The volume shows what has been done in 
reorganizing schools throughout the country ; 
indicates the trend of the junior high school 
movement; presents curricula of different 
schools for comparison; and supplies ma- 
terial and suggestions that may be made the 
basis of constructive work

Ve yx/ PREFACE 
IFTEEN years ago, while he was a student working 
under Professor Paul H. Hanus of Harvard University, 
the author of this book became acquainted with the theory 
of the junior high school. From the beginning it appealed 
to him greatly. It seemed to him to be based upon sound 
psychology, sound pedagogy, and sound common sense. 
As an American educator, he has ever since been an advocate 
of the junior high school plan. He has watched it grow in 
favor among teachers, school administrators, and members 
of the general public. He has noted the changes that have 
taken place in it during the past decade and a half and, while 
studying the practical treatment it has received in the pub- 
lic schools, he has endeavored to do some constructive think- 
ing on the subject of the plan himself. He is convinced, as 
a result of his observations, that the junior high school has 
come into the American educational system to stay. 
As an agency for fostering democracy and a way of giving 
boys and girls a keener interest in their school work and a 
better preparation for post-school life, the author believes 
that the junior high school plan should be still further de- 
veloped and its use extended. He believes its development 
should be guided and not left wholly to chance, and he has 
prepared this book in the hope that he may be able to in- 
dicate the application of certain pedagogical principles to 
the new plan and to present them in a plain and straight- 
forward fashion to all those who have the cause of American 
education at heart. He is well aware that his is not the first 
book to occupy the field, nor can he hope that it will prove 
the most conclusive. He has endeavored to add his con- 
tribution to the good work of others rather than need- 
lessly to duplicate their conclusions. Although he has made 
rather free use of data gathered by others and has availed

himself of permission to quote from printed authorities and 
to utilize particular accounts of the work now being carried 
on in various junior high schools of America, he has also 
drawn somewhat heavily upon his own resources, es- 
pecially upon the facts he obtained in the course of many 
visits paid to junior high schools in various parts of the coun- 
try, and upon his collection of printed courses of study, 
syllabi, and special circulars pertaining to particular schools. 
In this connection it may be said that in the effort to obtain 
data upon which to base his presentation of the junior high 
school plan in operation, the author applied to nearly every 
- board of education in the United States that was reported to 
have adopted the new arrangement and to have junior high 
schools with unique and interesting features under its con- 
trol. The result of these inquiries was very disappointing. 
Replies were received from nearly all of the authorities ad- 
dressed, but the majority of them either had no unique school 
features to describe or else had no data at hand that would 
serve to illustrate the matter. There were, however, a few 
notable exceptions. Los Angeles, St. Louis, Detroit, Buffalo, 
and Rochester forwarded material of great interest and value, 
and important aid was furnished by Grand Rapids, Kalama- 
zoo, Columbus, Berkeley, and Duluth. Among the smaller 
cities, Adrian, Menominee, Bellevue, and Monmouth af- 
forded the greatest help. To the school authorities of these 
various cities, the author wishes to express his gratitude. 
His thanks are due also to the State Departments of Public 
Instruction of Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, 
and California. The pages of the School Review, and es- 
pecially the articles concerning the junior high school written 
by the editor, R. L. Lyman, have been an inspiration to 
him, and he has likewise derived great encouragement from 
the publications of the Committee on the Reorganization of 
Education, edited by Clarence D. Kingsley.

  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL 
EDUCATION 
CHAPTER ONE 
Wuat THE Junior HicH Scuoot Is 
LTHOUGH the term Junior High School has been in 
use for more than a dozen years, there is evidence to 
show that confusion exists in the minds of many school 
administrators and educational theorists as to just what a 
junior high school is. The North Central Association of 
Colleges and Secondary Schools ' has probably done more to 
define the term than any other agency in the United States. 
For the past twenty-five years this Association has been at 
work clarifying the issues, establishing the principles, and de- 
termining the policies that pertain to the secondary schools 
of America. The junior high school is one of the subjects 
with which the Association has dealt at length, and, this be- 
ing so, we can hardly do better than to take its formulations 
in regard to the matter as a starting point for this chapter. 
In 1918 the North Central Association unanimously ap- 
proved the following declaration of principle: Resotven, 
That the term Junior High School, as used by this Association, 
shall be understood to apply only to schools including the ninth 
grade combined with the eighth grade, or with the eighth and 
seventh grades, in an organization distinct from the grades above 
and the grades below.? 
In formulating the above resolution, the Association tenta- 
tively defined a junior high school, so far as external organi- 
zation is concerned. It did not attempt to deal with the 
1 For a brief account of this organization, see an article entitled “The 
North Central Association,”’ School Review, Vol. 29, June, 1921. At present 
the Association covers the territory of nineteen Middle Western states, and 
includes in its membership about two hundred institutions of higher learn- 
ing and about fifteen hundred secondary schools.

  program of studies, buildings, and other vital topics. Nor 
did it aim to establish a fixed convention in regard to the 
school’s external form. It merely tried to make a finding 
that would serve as a definition for the time being. 
In order to obtain data to guide it in making a more com- 
prehensive and detailed finding, the Association, that same 
year, made an investigation concerning the junior high schools 
in North Central Association territory. A questionnaire 
was addressed to the accredited secondary schools of the 
Association. Replies were received from all (1165 in num- 
ber). Two hundred and ninety-three schools reported that 
they had taken steps in the reorganization of their systems 
and had done so according to the junior and senior high 
school plan. The following are summaries of those reports :!

These figures show that, even as late as 1918, a consider- 
able number of school authorities were far from agreeing as 
to what constitutes a junior high school. If the North 
Central Association’s resolution be taken as a criterion, only 
97 of the 293 schools claiming to be junior high schools were
-P-A-G-E-15
  WHAT THE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL IS 5 
truly such schools. Thisis less than one third of the number 
making the claim, and only a little over 8 per cent of the en- 
tire number canvassed. 
Confusion is also apparent when matters of organization 
and administration are considered. Of the 293 schools that 
claimed to have adopted the reform, only 16 per cent plus 
had segregated their junior high school pupils in a separate 
building,—to many educators, an absolutely indispensable 
part of the plan. Provision for some form of vocational 
guidance, for supervised study, and for some individual 
choice of subjects on the part of the pupil have also long 
been considered cardinal principles of the junior high school 
method; and yet only 52 per cent plus of the 293 schools 
in question allowed pupils a chance to choose subjects, 
only 46 per cent plus afforded pupils vocational guidance, 
and only 59 per cent claimed to have made provision 
for the supervision of study. Indeed, the only unity of 
practice among these schools is found in departmental 
organization, promotion by subject, and the introduction 
of certain forms of manual and household arts and of draw- 
ing and music; and all of these are modifications that 
had been ‘made in many school systems before the junior 
high school plan, as such, was known. Yet these changes 
and a change of name constituted the only reorganization 
that had taken place in many of the schools under consider- 
ation. 
The confusion indicated is by no means confined to the 
territory covered by the North Central Association. Briggs, 
in investigations covering the entire United States, found 
the same confusion everywhere.! 
It can scarcely be doubted that most, if not all, of the 
authorities claiming to have junior high schools have in re- 
cent years made notable changes in their school organization 
1 Junior High School, page 58.
-P-A-G-E-16
  6 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
and administration — particularly in the organization and 
administration of the seventh and eighth grades. But, in 
many of the schools, the changes have certainly not gone far 
enough to warrant giving to the modified unit a new rank and 
anew name. As the writer of the North Central Associa- 
tion report expresses it: 
Precisely what constitutes a junior high school (or anything that 
closely approximates it in fact) is a difficult question to answer. . . . 
Evidence is strong that, almost in scores of cases, the alleged reform 
school plan has consisted primarily of an altered name. Possibly 
the departmental organization of subject matter and teaching, 
possibly promotion by subject, and possibly one or two other de- 
sirable, but inconspicuous and not vital, changes have been made; 
but there is little to show that such schools have modified the pur- 
poses, the program of studies, the spirit, the methods, or the internal 
administration of the older type of school. . . . In short, it seems 
certain that altogether too many school systems are deceiving them- 
selves with names, are mistaking the husk for the kernel.* 
What, then, is a true junior high school? Many defini- 
tions have been formulated. None, perhaps, is wholly 
satisfactory. The following are among the best that have 
come under the author’s observation. Dr. Charles H. Johns- 
ton says: 
The junior high school is the name we have come to associate 
with new ideas of promotion, new methods of preventing elimination, 
new devices for moving selected groups through subject matter at 
different rates, higher compulsory school age, new and thorough 
analysis of pupil populations, enriched courses, varied . . . curricu- 
lum offerings, scientifically directed study practice, new schools 
for all sorts of educational guidance, new psychological charac- 
terizations in approaching the paramount school problem of in- 
dividual differences, new school year, new school day, new kind of 
class exercise, new kind of laboratory and library equipment and 
utilization, and new kinds of ultimate community service.’

  WHAT THE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL IS 7 
Obviously, Dr. Johnston is here describing a vision and not a 
reality. 
The North Central Association Commission on Sec- 
ondary Schools said, under date of March, 1919: 
A junior high school is a school in which the seventh, eighth, 
and ninth grades are segregated in a building (or portion of a build- 
ing) by themselves, possess an organization and administration of 
their own that is distinct from the grades above and the grades 
below, and are taught by a separate corps of teachers. Such schools, 
to fall within the classification of junior high schools, must likewise 
be characterized by the following : 
1. A program of studies decidedly greater in scope and richness 
of content than that of the traditional elementary school. 
Some pupil choice of studies, elected under supervision. 
Departmental teaching. 
Promotion by subject. 
Provision for testing out individual aptitudes in academic, 
prevocational, and vocational work. 
Some recognition of the peculiar needs of the retarded pupil 
of adolescent age, as well as special consideration of the super- 
normal. 
7. Some recognition of the plan of supervised study.! Pe» > 
In the course of an article published in the Educational 
Review in 1919, T. W. Gosling remarked : 
The purpose of the junior high school is to offer a program of 
studies which shall be suited to the varying needs of boys and girls 
in their early adolescence; to take into account the individual 
differences among boys and girls; to assist boys and girls to develop 
right attitudes toward life and its problems; to assist them in dis- 
covering and developing their natural aptitudes; to guide them 
carefully by a wise discipline through the trying time when they are 
passing from the period of control imposed by others to the period 
of self-control; to take into account their budding idealism and their 
emerging religious concepts; to give them opportunities for express- 
ing their social instincts in helpful and inspiring service; to correct 
physical defects and to build up habits of clean and healthy living;

to acquaint boys and girls in an elementary way with the social, the 
economic, and the political problems which they must soon face in 
the world outside of school; to inculcate in them both by theory 
and by practice the principles of good citizenship; to induce as 
many as possible to go on with their education in higher schools; 
and to give to those who must take up at once the toil for daily 
bread a good start by way of special, though elementary, vocational 
training. In brief, the purpose of the junior high school is to be a 
friend of the adolescent boy and girl by giving them a full, rich, and 
joyous life, — full and rich and joyous in the present and for that 
very reason full and rich and joyous in the days and the years to 
follow.? 
In the opinion of the present writer the junior high school 
may be defined as a school unit developed in the United 
States within recent years and designed to furnish to all 
pupils, between the ages of twelve and fifteen years approxi- 
mately, (1) continued common education on high elementary 
levels, and (2) the beginnings of a differentiated or secondary 
education adapted to each pupil’s individual needs. By 
providing a program of studies extensive in scope and by 
making use of methods of instruction and training that are 
grounded in the contemporary interests and concrete ex- 
periences of boys and girls of the early adolescent period, 
the new school seeks to mediate between strictly elementary 
school work and methods and the more specialized contents 
and processes of the senior high school and of the workaday 
world. To this end the new educational unit endeavors to 
organize its activities so as to retain a larger proportion of 
pupils in the school for a longer period than has been cus- 
tomary in the past; to give to them an appreciative notion 
of the world and its work in all of its diversified forms and in 
respect to its larger human relationships; to assist them to 
explore their own capacities, interests, and aptitudes, and

Review, Vol. 57, pages 377 et seg., May, 1919.

to choose, at least tentatively, a course of procedure that 
gives promise of yielding for them the greatest amount of 
happiness and, for society, the greatest and most effective 
service; and, finally, to furnish them such a training as will 
function ultimately in the career of their choice. To accom- 
plish this program, the new unit most frequently makes use 
of grades seven, eight, and nine in the school system. 
THE NAME OF THE NEW SCHOOL 
The use of the name Junior High School is by no means 
uniform. In certain places, names hallowed by tradition 
and possessing a particular significance to the community 
have been applied to schools that embody every feature of 
the reform and that are, in reality, junior high schools. Fran- 
cis E. Willard School, Roosevelt School, J. W. Smith School, 
are examples of names that have a particular social signifi- 
cance. Other names that have been used to indicate a re- 
organization on the junior high school plan are Departmental 
School, Grammar School, Sub-High School, and Higher Pri- 
mary School. 
In the Western and Middle Western states, where the new 
school first gained popular recognition and where historical 
precedent holds less firmly, the expression Junior High School 
has been generally adopted. In the East, where for genera- 
tions the terms Intermediate Grades and Grammar Grades 
have been employed to designate divisions of the elementary 
school, the name Intermediate School is more commonly 
found. In many instances, too, the name Junior High 
School seems to be preferred if the school includes three 
grades — the seventh, eighth, and ninth; while the name 
Intermediate School is more likely to be chosen if the reor- 
ganization involves nothing above the eighth grade. 
It is doubtful if any single name will ever be generally 
adopted for schools operating under the junior high school plan.

  10 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
In some quarters the trend seems to be toward the name 
Intermediate School. Detroit and Buffalo have recently 
adopted this name, and Boston also employs it. At Jackson, 
Michigan, a town of sixty thousand inhabitants, two new 
buildings of ultra-modern design and equipment have re- 
cently been erected at an approximate cost of $300,000 each, 
and the words ‘‘ Intermediate School’’ have been conspicu- 
ously inscribed upon their facades. Saginaw, Michigan, has 
likewise chosen this term for its newschools. The advocates 
of this name say that to give the new school the title 
Junior High School is to suggest that its prime function is 
to prepare pupils for a senior high school; that the term 
invites the officials of the senior high school to dominate 
the work and spirit of the new school; that it causes young 
pupils to have too marked a sense of social and intellectual 
superiority, and that it encourages them to copy the ways of 
older pupils; and, finally, that the name hampers the re- 
cruiting of desirable teachers for the seventh, eighth, and 
ninth grades, by making them conscious of an implied in- 
feriority of position. Moreover, the friends of the name 
Intermediate School declare that this name best suits the 
school because it is truly intermediate in character, stand- 
ing as it does midway between the elementary school and 
the senior high school. 
On the other hand, thename Junior High School is strongly 
entrenched and widely advertised. It appears in the litera- 
ture of the reform and has the advantage of a certain novelty. 
St. Louis, Rochester, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Duluth, Grand 
Rapids, all the towns of California, and scores of other places 
abide by the name Junior High School. A. P. Jones, 
writing in the School Review, advocates the use of the name 
in the following words: 
It hardly seems fair to emphasize in the name itself a pur- 
pose that is incidental at best and erroneous for a considerable
-P-A-G-E-21

number of pupils. The name Junior High School is better chiefly 
because it itself appeals to the young adolescent more strongly than 
does the term Intermediate School. It is an end in itself; it sounds 
better to the boy and girl; it lends itself better to the formation 
of athletic teams, literary societies, and other school activities; it 
is easier to develop a feeling of pride and responsibility in a junior 
high school than in an intermediate school. In a word, it fulfills 
in itself better the purpose of the organization — that of meeting 
individual needs.* 
This opinion, so well considered and so admirably expressed, 
represents substantially the views of the present writer. 
THE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL NOT A PART OF THE SIX-YEAR 
HIGH SCHOOL 
The practice of designating the lower half of a complete six- 
year high school as a junior high school adds to the confusion 
of terminology. Strictly speaking, a six-year high school 
does not include a junior high school. The six-year school 
is an integer by itself, although it may be subdivided in such 
a manner as to warrant the use of the expressions Junior 
Division and Senior Division. When a single building is 
employed to house all six grades and a single corps of teachers 
gives instruction and a single staff of supervisors takes charge 
of the administration, it is a misnomer to style any portion 
of the school a Junior High School or an Intermediate School. 
Ex-Superintendent C. P. Cary of Wisconsin says in regard 
to this question : 
The six-year high school is an- excellent institution, but it is not 
entitled to call its first three grades a junior high school unless they 
are a distinctive organization with characteristic program of studies, 
methods of teaching, and methods of discipline. The reason for 
this disqualification arises from the fact that the six-year high school 
1 School Review, page 115, February, 1918.
-P-A-G-E-22
  12 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
almost surely will do little more than to carry down into the seventh 
and eighth grades the practices which have been associated with the 
senior high school.! 
No doubt a six-year organization, without subdivisions, is 
best for many communities. Wherever the entire enrollment 
in the six upper grades includes fewer than five hundred pupils, 
it seems unwise to seek to organize the school in two separate 
units. Something, to be sure, may be lost by not doing so; 
something, on the other hand, is certainly gained by not 
doing so. With an average of fewer than one hundred 
pupils to a grade, little opportunity can exist for providing, 
economically, any considerable amount of elective work in 
the curriculum ; or for grouping pupils into sections in 
accordance with their special abilities; or for furnishing the 
school with simple equipment for carrying on laboratory, 
shop, and office work; or for utilizing the auditorium, gym- 
nasium, and playgrounds in an effective manner; or for 
developing the types of discipline, school spirit, and interest 
in collateral activities that are most desirable. Hence the 
conclusion seems to follow that the six-year high school is 
the best type of organization for small cities and towns and 
for rural communities that have consolidated schools.- 
On the other hand, opinion seems to hold that it is‘a 
serious mistake for the larger cities and towns to reorganize 
their school systems on the basis of the six-six plan. In 
these larger places there are sufficient numbers of pupils who 
can be brought to a common center to make the organization 
of separate and distinct junior high schools defensible. 
Where such is the case, evidence is not wanting to show the 
wisdom of this organization.

WHAT THE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL IS 13 
CONCLUSION 
Finally —to sum up the answer to the question, What is 
a junior high school? —it may be said that a junior high 
school is a school that comprehends the following factors : 
(1) A separate organization of the seventh, eighth, and 
ninth grades, or of at least two of these grades. 
(2) A separate building in which to house these grades. 
(3) A separate staff of teachers and supervisory officers to 
administer the work of these grades. 
(4) A program of studies differing greatly from the course 
of study to be found in the like-numbered grades of the 
traditional school in America. 
(5) A partial or complete departmental organization of 
subject matter and teaching. 
(6) The organization of a limited number of curricula, each 
containing groups of constant and of variable courses. 
(7) A definite, effective plan of educational and vocational 
guidance, definitely and effectively administered. 
(8) Certain elective studies, to be chosen by pupils under 
guidance. 
(9) Socialized recitation periods. 
(10) Supervised study periods. 
(11) Promotion by subject. 
(12) Methods of instruction differing notably from the 
—_ employed in the grades above and the grades 
elow 
(13) The organization and administration of student ac- 
tivities in accordance with the needs and interests of 
adolescent pupils, regardless of the practices premgneg 
in the grades above or below. 
(14) The organization of the school year, the school week, 
the school day, and the school hour in such a manner 
as to produce a school discipline, a school spirit, and a
-P-A-G-E-24

school accomplishment that find justification in and 
through the principles of psychology, physiology, so- 
ciology, and pedagogy, regardless of the bias of tra- 
dition, the demands of particularized life callings, and 
the requirements of the senior high school and colleges. 
(15) The admission of pupils to the school on the basis of 
what is best for each individual, without undue regard 
to the conventional school work he has mastered. .

tastes, and purposes in the organization and conduct 
of class work.

CHAPTER TWO 
HistoricAL DEVELOPMENT 
HE junior high school movement is the result of an 
older and a much more comprehensive educational 
movement. Viewed in this way, it may be traced far back 
into the past. Comenius (1592-1670) and Rousseau (1712- 
1778) both advocated reforms that embodied elements which 
find support in the reorganization plans of the present day 
— Comenius, on the side of external forms; Rousseau, on 
the side of internal practices and spirit. 
To Comenius may perhaps be attributed the first formu- 
lation of a plan of school organization based upon the six- 
year unit. His plan comprised : 
(1) The Infant School (“School of the Mother’s Knee”), 
including the years one to six. 
(2) The Vernacular School (for pupils with a limited 
school career before them), including the years seven 
to twelve. 
(3) The Chiconeales (for pupils preparing for the Uni- 
versity), including the years thirteen to eighteen. 
(4) The University (affording opportunities for liberal 
culture), including the years nineteen to twenty- 
four. 
(5) The College of Light (providing facilities for scientific 
investigation and professional training), including 
the years twenty-five to thirty. 
The influence of Rousseau on modern education centers 
in his demand for the development of individuality and nat- 
uralness in pupils; the recognition of individual differences 
in capacities, tastes, and achievements among them; the 
appeal to interest rather than to fear in giving instruction ; 
and stress upon subject matter relating to real life rather 
than upon a formal treatment of more or less abstract ma- 
terial.

  16 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
In 1821 the Boston English Classical School was es- 
tablished upon principles that agree with some of those that 
underlie the junior high school of today. This Boston school 
provided a three-year course designed for boys who had com- 
pleted a five-, six-, or seven-year elementary course and were 
desirous of fitting themselves, not to enter college, but to 
take their places in the business world at about the age of 
fifteen or sixteen years. The age of admission to the school 
was fixed at twelve years. Thus the Boston school rested, 
as does the junior high school, upon an elementary school 
course of less than eight years, and offered a three-year course 
covering the period from twelve to fifteen years of age. Like 
the junior high school, it was complete in and of itself, and 
found its justification in the needs of the local community. 
BEGINNINGS OF CHANGE IN THE HIGH SCHOOL SYSTEM 
Near the close of the nineteenth century, the reform 
movement began its rapid swing forward. The exact date 
for marking its rise has not infrequently been set for the 
year 1888, when President Eliot of Harvard, in an address 
delivered before the Department of Superintendence of the 
National Education Association, sketched a plan of reform 
that was extensive in scope and specific in its reeommenda- 
tions. President Eliot’s chief concern was for the college 
student, and he approached the topic of educational reorgani- 
zation with the interest of the collegian first in his mind. 
Particularly did he plead for such reforms as would shorten 
the periods of academic and professional study and permit a 
college graduate to enter one or two years earlier upon his 
active career. Among the specific reforms which he advo- 
cated were: the elimination of many topics from the tra- 
ditional curriculum and the curtailment of others; the short- 
ening of the long vacation periods; the lengthening of the
-P-A-G-E-27
  
  HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT i? 
school day; the better training of teachers; and the reor- 
ganization of the administration and methods of the school. 
Report of the Committee of Ten (1893) 
Dr. Eliot’s criticisms and recommendations excited much 
discussion, and in July, 1892, the National Education Asso- 
ciation appointed the now famous Committee of Ten. This 
Committee had authority to arrange “‘a conference of the 
school and college teachers of each principal subject which 
enters into the programs of secondary schools in the United 
States and into the requirements for admission to college.” ! 
The Committee of Ten made its report in 1893, and its 
declarations have exerted a profound influence upon all 
later educational reforms in the United States. In partic- 
ular, they have had a marked influence upon the junior 
high school. 
Certain conclusions of the Committee of Ten are especially 
pertinent to the theme of this book. Among these are the 
following :” 
(1) It is feasible and desirable that all of the principal subjects 
(except Greek) which are offered in the secondary schools should be 
begun in the grades before the high school.* 
(2) In organizing and teaching these subjects no differentiation 
should be made in content or method for any class of pupils, but 
each “‘should be taught in the same way and to the same extent — 
no matter what the probable destination of the pupil may be or at 
what point his education is to cease.” 
(3) “For the purposes of general education, one study is as good 
as another,” and “the choice of subjects in secondary schools is a 
matter of comparative indifference.” 
1 Report of the Committee of Ten, page 3. 
2 Ibid., pages 14, 17, 45, 51, 56, 57. 
’The subjects mentioned included Latin, Modern Foreign Language, 
English, Mathematics, Physical Science, Natural History, Geography, 
and the Social Sciences (History, Civil Government, and Political Economy).
-P-A-G-E-28
  18 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
(4) “It is impossible to make a satisfactory secondary school 
program, limited to four years and founded on the present elementary 
school subjects and methods. In the opinion of the Committee, 
several subjects now reserved for the high school, such as algebra, 
geometry, natural science, and foreign languages, should be begun 
earlier than now, and therefore within the schools classified as ele- 
mentary; or, as an alternative, the secondary school period should 
be made to begin two years earlier than at present, leaving six years 
instead of eight for the elementary school period.” 
(5) “The secondary schools of the United States, as a whole, do 
not exist for the purpose of preparing boys and girls for colleges. 
Their main function is to prepare for the duties of life that small 
proportion of all the children in the country who show themselves 
able to profit by an education prolonged to the eighteenth year, and 
whose parents are able to support them while they remain so long in 
school.” 
Taken as a whole, the report of the Committee of Ten 
may be regarded as a forward-looking report. It lent its 
approval to remedial suggestions which later became vital 
factors in the organization of the junior high school. Thus, 
it subscribed to the principle of an enriched program of stud- 
ies for secondary schools; the reduction of the elementary 
school to six years and the extension of the secondary school 
to six years; the recognition of individual interests and am- 
bitions among pupils; the assignment of adequate, though 
not uniform, class-time allotments for the various subjects 
of study; and the adoption of departmental teaching below 
the ninth grade. 
Report of the Committee of Fifteen (1895) 
The second notable committee to consider reforms was the 
Committee of Fifteen. This Committee, appointed by the 
Department of Superintendence in 1893, reported in 1895. 
Only one section of the report bears directly upon topics  
-P-A-G-E-29
  
  HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT 19 
centering in the junior high school. This is the one entitled 
“The Correlation of Studies in Elementary Education.” 
In some respects the Committee of Fifteen was less liberal 
than the Committee of Ten. While it favored adding manual 
arts for boys and household arts for girls to the elementary 
school curriculum, it opposed the organization of the so- 
called practical courses for pupils whose school careers were 
likely to terminate with the elementary school. Again, 
this Committee, revoking the judgment of the Committee 
of Ten, went on record as not in favor of reducing the time 
allotment of the elementary school from eight years to six. 
However, it did recommend “that in the seventh and eighth 
years a modified form of algebra be introduced in place of 
advanced arithmetic, and that in the eighth year English 
grammar yield place to Latin.” It also favored depart- 
mental teaching in the seventh and eighth grades, and a more 
flexible plan for promotion throughout all the grades.! 
The Report of the Committee of Fifteen is somewhat 
ponderous in its discussions and never had the practical 
influence of the report of the Committee of Ten. Never- 
theless, the combined influence of these two reports led 
to a more or less general adoption of the principles of 
departmental organization of teaching and of promotion of 
pupils by subjects in the seventh and eighth grades consider- 
ably before the junior high school, as such, was conceived. 
Report of the Committee on College Entrance 
Requirements (1899) 
The Committee on College Entrance Requirements was 
the next committee to take up the task of reform. This 
Committee, appointed by the Department of Secondary 
Education of the National Education Association in 1895, 
followed a slightly different avenue of approach and made 
1 Report of the Committee of Fifteen, pages 15, 87, 95, 97.
-P-A-G-E-30
    20 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
its final report in 1899. So far as its findings bear upon the 
question of the external reorganization of the grades, this 
Committee went counter to the recommendations of the 
Committee of Fifteen and agreed with the Committee of 
Ten. It stated, “In our opinion, it is important that the 
last two grades that now precede the high school course 
should be incorporated in it.””! All instruction in these two 
grades, however, was, wherever practicable, to be under the 
supervision of the high school teacher. 
There is nothing in this report that forecasts a junior high 
school organized as a separate unit and having a distinct 
function of its own. What it foreshadows is a longer pe- 
riod of time in which to provide a secondary school training 
of the traditional sort; that is, a six-year high school with 
its counterpart, a six-year elementary school. 
DEVELOPMENT FROM 1890 To 1910 
But meanwhile forces tending to bring about modifica- 
tion in secondary education in European countries were con- 
spicuously at work, and these gave support to the reform 
movement in America. In Germany, the quarrel between 
the advocates of the gymnasial training and that offered by 
the Realschulen led to the calling of a notable school confer- 
ence in 1890, the outcome of which was favorable to the pro- 
gressive party. During the same period, France was going 
through a similar struggle for reform. There, the Latinists 
and the scientists, the conservatives and the liberals, the 
formalists and the modernists, sought each their own ad- 
vantage. The result was that a sweepingly liberal reform 
was carried through, and administrative changes resembling 
those being advocated by the progressives in America were 
adopted. 
1 Report of the Committee on College Entrance Requirements, page 23.
-P-A-G-E-31
  eee HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT 21 
The American progressives desired a genuine reform in 
aims, content, methods, and spirit. President William R. 
Harper, of the University of Chicago; President Nicholas 
Murray Butler, of Columbia University; Professor Paul H. 
Hanus, of Harvard University; Professor John Dewey, of 
the University of Chicago; and several of the leading super- 
intendents and principals of schools, endorsed this policy. 
These men, imbued with a true missionary spirit, pushed the 
reform program forward on every appropriate occasion. 
The result was that the decade from 1900 to 1910 became a 
notable one in the annals of American education. During 
this period several new committees were appointed to in- 
vestigate and to report. Among these were: 
(1) The Commission of Twenty-one appointed under 
the direction of the annual conference of the Uni- 
versity of Chicago in 1903, President Harper being 
chairman. 
(2) The Committee on the Cultural Element and Econ- 
omy of Time in Education, appointed by the 
National Council of Education in 1907, President 
Baker of the University of Colorado being chairman. 
(3) The Committee on the Advisability of the Six-Six 
Plan, appointed by the Department of Secondary 
Education in 1905, Dr. E. W. Lyttle, State Inspector 
for High Schools in New York, being chairman. 
One and all of these committees subscribed to the principle 
of elimination from the course of study of many worn-out 
and unpractical subjects; a better articulation of the work 
offered in the several years; and a complete reorganization 
of the form of the public school system on the basis of a 
Six-six arrangement of grades. The Committee reports 
were presented from time to time as late as 1911. In none 
of them, however, does it appear that the idea of subdividing 
the six-year high school into two wholly differentiated parts 
entered into the deliberations of the committees or found
-P-A-G-E-32
22 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
expression in their formulations. It was the six-year high 
school that was advocated. 
Nevertheless, the modified six-six plan was quietly develop- 
ing. As early as 1896, the seventh and eighth grades of 
the public schools in Richmond, Indiana, had been housed 
in a separate building, centrally located, and the adminis- 
tration of the school had made use of the departmental plan 
of instruction, promotion by subject, and the awarding of 
credits for work satisfactorily performed. The program of 
studies was also divided into three distinctive curricula. 
In Kalamazoo, Michigan, the practice of segregating the 
entire eighth grade of the city in one building was begun 
before 1890; and in 1902 the ninth grade was combined 
with the eighth in what was styled a “departmental school.” 
In 1904 the city schools of Muskegon, Michigan, were or- 
ganized on the following plan: the first six grades in munici- 
pal ward buildings; the seventh grades of the entire city 
in a departmental school; the eighth and ninth grades in 
the high school annex; and the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth 
grades in the high school proper. Nor were attempts lack- 
ing considerably before 1910 to differentiate the work in the 
unified six-year high schools in order to meet the require- 
ments of particular types of students. For the most part, 
the differentiations took the form of two distinct curricula 
— the one preparatory to college, the other preparatory to 
life. Such expressly advertised curricula were inaugurated 
at Chicago in 1894, and at Providence and Saginaw in 1898. 
The charge of “class distinctions”? was soon heard, however, 
public dissatisfaction developed, and the reform was aban- 
doned in all three places. 
y DEVELOPMENT FROM 1910 TO THE PRESENT 
In the third decade of the systematic reform movement, the 
junior high school, in name and in fact, definitely emerged
-P-A-G-E-33
  
  HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT 23 
into public view and public favor. Beginning with 1910, or 
a little earlier, emphasis shifted from the clear-cut six-six plan 
to a plan of reform within the reform. This was variously ex- 
pressed as a six-three-three arrangement; a six-two-four ar- 
rangement; a six-one-five arrangement; a six-two-two-two 
arrangement; a six-one-two-three arrangement; a six-five 
arrangement; and several other groupings of time periods. 
Cities and towns seemed to vie with each other in the rapid- 
ity of their reforms and the novelty of their changes. In 
part, the reorganizations are to be explained by the necessity 
for providing suddenly for the increased numbers of pupils 
who early in the twentieth century crowded into the second- 
ary schools; in part, by the influence of the scientific move- 
ment in education, with its stress upon experimentation; in 
part, by the influence of the recommendations previously 
made by the reform committees; in part, by the weight of 
newly formulated principles of psychology, pedagogy, and 
sociology ; and, in part, by the necessity of providing a dem- 
ocratic education for all the children of a democratic nation, 
in accordance with the wishes and demands of that nation’s 
voters and taxpayers. 
From 1910 to the present day, committees of national 
importance have continued to deliberate upon the reform 
of secondary education and to make formal reports and rec- 
ommendations. One of the first was the Committee of Nine. 
This Committee was appointed by the Department of Sec- 
ondary Education of the National Education Association in 
1910 and made its report on “What the High School 
Should Accomplish,” in 1911.1 This Committee made the 
following declarations : 
(1) It is the duty of the tax-supported high school to give to every 
student instruction carefully designed to return to society intelligent, 
able-bodied, and progressive citizens. 
1 National Education Association, Proceedings, 1911, pages 599 et seq.
-P-A-G-E-34
24 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
(2) The high school period is the testing time, the time for trying 
out different powers, the time for forming life purposes. Conse- 
quently, the opportunity should be provided for the student to test 
his capacity in a fairly large number of relatively diverse kinds of 
work. 
(3) In the high school the boy (or girl) may very properly make a 
start along the line of his chosen vocation, but a final choice should 
not be forced upon him at the beginning of that career. 
(4) Only when the liberal and the vocational elements of training 
are blended “does the liberal receive its social significance and 
importance. . .. In other words, the boy who pursues both the 
liberal and vocational sees the relation of his work to the work of 
others and to the welfare of society, whereas the liberal without the 
vocational leaves him a mere spectator in the theater of life, and the 
boxes of this theater are already overcrowded.” 
(5) Mechanical arts, agriculture, or household science should be 
recognized as rational elements in the education of all boys and girls, 
and especially of those who have not as yet chosen their vocation. 
By means of exclusively bookish curricula false ideals of culture are 
developed. A chasm is created between the producers of material 
wealth and the distributors and consumers thereof. 
(6) The high school should in a real sense reflect the major in- 
dustries of the community which supports it. 
(7) Our traditional ideals of preparation for higher institutions 
are particularly incongruous with the actual needs and future respon- 
sibilities of girls. It would seem that such high-school work as is 
carefully designed to develop capacity for, and interest in, the proper 
management and conduct of a home should be regarded as of im- 
portance at least equal to that of any other work. 
While the Report makes no mention of a junior high school 
but speaks always of “the high school,’ it must be remem- 
bered that the ‘Department of Secondary Education which 
appointed the Committee had, two years earlier (1909), 
approved the plan of a six-year high school. Hence the 
recommendations of the Committee of Nine relate as truly 
to the seventh and eighth grades as they do to the grades
-P-A-G-E-35
HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT 25 
above, and these recommendations establish principles upon 
which the curriculum of the junior high school is, in part, 
builded. 
In 1911, shortly after the Committee of Nine presented 
its report, the Commission on the Reorganization of Second- 
ary Education was organized to carry forward the reform 
program. This Commission, headed by Clarence D. Kings- 
ley, State Supervisor of High Schools for Massachusetts, is 
patterned after the organization of the Committee of Ten. 
Sixteen sub-committees dealing with particular aspects of 
the reform question constitute the large working force which 
concerns itself with details. The chairmen of these sixteen 
committees, together with ten members selected at large, 
constitute a reviewing committee whose function is to edit 
and approve the reports of the various sub-committees.! 
The commission on the Reorganization of Secondary Educa- 
tion has been at work since 1912, and has approved and pub- 
lished fifteen reports.? In its bulletin, “Cardinal Principles 
of Secondary Education”’ (1918), the organization of the

plan is recommended. Several of its special reports likewise 
take cognizance of this plan. 
Several other committees, more or less local in character, 
have likewise dealt with the problem of reorganization dur- 
ing the past eleven years, and these have generally adopted 
principles of a similar nature to those held by the Commit- 
tee of Nine. 
In the meantime, junior high schools have developed apace. 
Just which city may claim the honor of establishing the first 
one is not clear. Richmond, Indiana, had a separate organi- 
zation for the seventh and eighth grades as early as 1896, 
and the Richmond school administration had adopted sev- 
eral of the features which are now generally regarded as essen- 
tials of a junior high school. Possibly many other cities 
and towns had somewhat modified their school organiza- 
tions as early as Richmond. But it is not until about the 
years 1909 and 1910 that any well-planned, conscious effort 
to organize schools on a clear-cut six-three-three basis ap- 
pears to have been made anywhere in America. In 1909, 
Berkeley, California, reorganized its schools on this plan. 
Grand Rapids, Michigan, opened its first junior high school 
in 1911. Los Angeles took the step in 1911. New York 
adopted the six-two-four arrangement as a state-wide plan 
in 1910, styling the reorganized seventh and eighth grades, 
the “intermediate school.’’ Columbus, Evansville, and sev- 
eral other cities reorganized their systems at about the same 
time. Taking the figures up to and including the year 1917, 
Briggs found that 272 towns claimed junior high schools, 
established as follows: !

Davis, reporting on the investigation made by the North 
Central Association in 1918, found 293 cities in North Cen- 
tral territory which claimed junior high schools. Accord- 
ing to his report, these schools had been established thus: ! 
Before 1916 . . . . . 160, or 54.61 per cent of all 
In 1916 . . . . . 61, or 20.82 per cent of all 
In 1917 . . . . . 1%, or 24.57 per cent of all 
Rorem, in making his compilation from studies covering 
the same period, gives the entire number of junior high 
schools in the United States as 354;? while the United 
States Bureau of Education states the number as 557 for 
the year 1917-1918,' and, referring to the situation in 1923, 
says: 
* Today junior high schools are numbered by the hundreds. Five 
hundred and seventy-five cities having a population of 2500 and 
over report such schools. If all cities having such schools had re- 
ported, there would without doubt be several hundred more to

add to this list. Just how many there are in places of less than 
2500 population is not known, but there are at least several hun- 
dred. 
Whatever be the exact figures, it is certain that since 1918 
junior high schools have developed at a rapid rate. 
SUMMARY 
Thus, by way of summary, up to the present time the re- 
form movement which has produced the junior high school 
has passed through three periods of development and may be 
viewed from three standpoints. 
(A) Regarding Purposes 
(1) From 1890 to 1900, the aim was to shorten the period 
of training for the college student who is preparing to enter 
professional life. 
(2) From 1900 to 1910, the aim was to hold more pupils 
of all types in the upper grades of the elementary school and 
in the high school, and particularly to make vocational 
provision for those who intended to go to work. 
(3) From 1910 to the present time, the aim has been to 
discover the individual characteristics of pupils and to pro- 
vide a more adequate education for each particular child in 
whatever grade of the school he may happen to be. 
During the first period, the movement was guided and in- 
fluenced largely by university administrators; in the second 
period, by public school authorities; in the third period, by 
professional students of pedagogy. 
(B) Regarding Methods 
(1) From 1890 to 1900, the movement consisted of de- 
structive criticism of the old order and vague reachings for 
something better to take its place.

(2) From 1900 to 1910, the movement was characterized 
by the formulation of positive educational theories and of 
plans for putting them into operation. 
(3) From 1910 to the present time, the movement has 
concerned itself with the practical application of theories, 
the analysis of processes, and the modification of adminis- 
tration in accordance with the results obtained. In other 
words, the method of school experimentation was adopted. 
(C) Regarding Content 
(1) From 1890 to 1900, interest and discussion centered 
in topics relating to the external forms of school reorganiza- 
tion. 
(2) From 1900 to 1910, interest and discussion centered 
in topics relating to the internal administration of the school 
and the individual requirements of the pupils. 
(3) From 1910 to the present time, interest and discus- 
sion have centered in the subject matter, the methods of 
teaching, and the spirit behind the work.

CHAPTER THREE 
ADOLESCENT CHARACTERISTICS AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS 
HE junior high school has been developed in order to 
serve better the real interests and needs of the Amer- 
ican youth. It is pertinent therefore to review briefly the 
conspicuous characteristics of boys and girls of the early 
adolescent age and to inquire what implications these 
characteristics have for the pedagogical reformer. 
OLD ASSUMPTIONS AS TO ADOLESCENCE 
The older notion respecting adolescence was that puberty, 
the most fundamental element that enters into the problem, 
was of nearly uniform occurrence among youths of both sexes 
wherever like racial and geographical factors operated; that 
it occurred, for the most part, at about the time a youth was 
fourteen or fifteen years of age; and that it called for no 
special consideration so far as the organization and the 
administration of schools was concerned. Pubertal rites 
and ceremonies had, to be sure, been peculiar and conspicuous 
practices among many peoples from earliest times, but their 
use rested upon superstitious beliefs that had no special 
validity or significance for modern peoples. Whatever 
initiation or guidance was needed for a boy or girl entering 
upon the adolescent stage of development, it was thought, 
could be readily given, as of old, in a brief period of time and 
without any special preparation being made for doing so. 
NEWER VIEWS AND DEDUCTIONS 
Extensive studies recently made in respect to adolescence 
reach conclusions that are considerably at variance with the 
older notions. According to these studies, pubescence is 
not the nearly uniform thing it was formerly thought to be, 
30
-P-A-G-E-41
      
ADOLESCENT CHARACTERISTICS 31 
but is a very uncertain event in the lives of youths. Its 
- appearance varies, in point of time, with many factors — 
race, environment, climate, occupation, health, and possibly 
other elements. Its range is from nine years or earlier to 
eighteen years or later, with the mode for girls being about 
the age of twelve or thirteen and for boys one year older. 
While physiologists and psychologists are not wholly in 
accord as to the beginnings of sex influences in character 
development; nor as to the extent and suddenness of the 
mental, emotional, and volitional changes wrought in 
individuals when they make their visible appearance, never- 
theless, as Koos phrases it, “there are few who will take 
exception to the statement that there is a pulse of sex interest 
near the time of (the) appearance . . . of the external signs 
of puberty . . . [although] there can be little doubt that 
such measurements as have been made of the traits of child- 
hood indicate no large sudden spurts in mental abilities com- 
parable with those found in the realm of the physiological.” } 
Perhaps for the purposes of this book the most significant 
conclusion from the recent studies is that puberty, with all 
its concomitant effects upon the intellectual, emotional, and 
volitional nature of the youth, begins, on an average, nearly 
two years earlier than was formerly generally supposed; thus, 
if the three years from twelve to fifteen be considered as a 
unit, the majority of youths will have reached sex maturity 
- within that transition period.’ 
GENERAL CONDITIONS OF ADOLESCENCE 
While the changes that are wrought in the nature of 
youths during or about the period mentioned defy exact 
classification, and while, during this time, each boy and girl

-P-A-G-E-42
32 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
is sut generis and conforms, in some respects, to no type 
that can be mentioned, nevertheless certain general con- 
ditions distinguish the period. For the sake of convenience 
these may be grouped under four headings: (1) physical, 
(2) intellectual, (3) emotional, and (4) volitional. 
(1) Phased. Conditions / 
On the physical side the approach and appearance of 
pubescence are accompanied by notable changes in bodily 
structure, form, and function. Generally speaking, the 
period is one of remarkable growth in height and weight, 
in the development of the vital organs, and in the shape 
and structure of the bones and muscles. The blood pressure 
and the blood circulation increase enormously. Not in- 
frequently there are palpitations of the heart, fainting 
spells, headache, and green sickness. The larynx enlarges 
and gives rise to a completely altered quality of voice. The 
appetite is fickle and sleep is unsound. And, as Professor 
Whipple puts it, “It is tempting, and doubtless justifiable, 
to suppose that the central nervous system likewise matures 
unevenly.”’! 
Concomitant with the appearance and development of 
these bodily changes usually occur conspicuous modifications 
of physical traits. There is a bodily restlessness that seeks 
satisfaction in movement and activity. There is a super- 
abundance of physical energy, following the expenditure of 
which frequently come periods of pronounced fatigue and 
dull listlessness, with rapid recovery after short periods of 
rest. There are growing pains caused by the uneven develop- 
ment of bones and tendons. There is an incodrdination of 
muscles, resulting in extreme awkwardness. There is a 
change in the pitch and quality of the voice. There are 
1 Whipple, G. M., “Psychology and Hygiene of Adolescence,”’ in Monroe’s 
Principles of Secondary Education, page 253.
-P-A-G-E-43
  ADOLESCENT CHARACTERISTICS 33 
intensifications of the sensory powers. There are sudorific 
effusions that frequently are mortifying. And fundamental 
to all of these, there is a sex consciousness and a sex interest 
that colors every emotion, thought, and action, and reveals 
itself, in particular, in a novel attraction for members of the 
opposite sex, in likes and dislikes based upon trivial details 
of personality, in a tendency to coyness, bashfulness, or 
bravado in the presence of idealized members of the opposite 
sex, and in the development of the various stages of sex 
love. 
(2) Intellectual Conditions 
On the intellectual side likewise the approach and develop- 
ment of pubescence are characterized by conspicuous changes. 
There is a redirection of sense perceptions and a new interest 
in particular odors, flavors, sights, and sounds. There is a 
vividness of imagery, particularly in matters relating to sex. 
There is an enlarged power of analysis and of reasoning in a 
truly logical manner. There is a tendency to disputatious- 
ness and to the expression of critical judgments respecting 
a multiplicity of subjects heretofore little considered. There 
is an interest in mysticism and forms of thought and ex- 
pression regarded as being unknown to most other individu- 
als. There is a desire, often amounting almost to a craze, 
for reading books dealing with adventure, love, and action. 
There is a keen interest in linguistics and a fondness for 
acquiring new and unusual words and of making use of them 
in casual conversation. There is a curiosity about self, and 
life, and eternal verities that is doubtless never matched at 
other periods of existence. There is a self-consciousness and 
a tendency to introspection that results, often, in super- 
sensitiveness, morbidness, and secretiveness. ‘There is an 
altruistic and idealistic interest in others and in life which is 
rare in the earlier or later years. There is a fondness for
-P-A-G-E-44
34 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
new relationships, — with persons, things, and forces. And 
there is, mingled with all the idealistic elements that reveal 
themselves, a strong attachment for the practical and Lee 
factors that operate in human affairs. 
(3) Emotional Conditions 
On the emotional side, the approach and appearance of 
pubescence evidence themselves by deep stirrings of the sub- 
jective nature, the feelings, when aroused, fairly choking the 
individual who seeks to repress them and fairly exhausting 
the one who unrestrainedly gives way to their surgings. The 
manifestations of these emotional workings are likely to show 
themselves in moodiness, unresponsiveness, morbidness, 
hysteria, laughter, giggling, singing, shouting, dancing, 
bodily contortions, and numerous other ways. Indeed, the 
whole gamut of the forms of expression is run. When 
in the emotional whirl, the individual is likely to be affected 
by an intense admiration for heroes and a pride in the heroic; 
by bursts of generosity amounting to extreme self-sacrifice ; 
by a personal desire for renown, honor, and fame; by an eager 
desire to reform every and all situations and persons who 
fail to measure up to the standard set by his critical, though 
immature, judgment; by a display of sympathy for the 
weak and unfortunate; by an aroused religious sentiment 
and a spirit of questioning about deity, the universe, and the 
problems of life and death; by an interest in art and esthetic 
expression; by interest in the spectacular and in dramatic 
representations; and by wishing, wishing, continually wish- 
ing for the unrealized, and possibly the unrealizable, satis- 
factions of the human spirit. 
(4) Volitional Conditions 
On the side of the volitional, the approach and appearance 
of pubescence are marked by the rise, or accentuation, of 
 
-P-A-G-E-45
  ADOLESCENT CHARACTERISTICS 35 
such instincts as the following: gregariousness, venture- 
someness, exploration, migration, organization, codperation, 
and domination. As in respect to most other adolescent 
characteristics, these are not the sole possession of youths of 
this stage of development. Whipple states the situation 
well when he says: 
We do not need to assume that these instinctive responses to 
the situations of daily life are seen only during or after puberty, 
or that they are manifested in the same way by all adolescents, 
or that no other causes conspire to elicit them than the biological 
upheaval of puberty. The essential thing is that these types of 
feeling and behavior are normally intensified as the body assumes 
preparedness for the functions of racial perpetuation. Compared 
with the relatively self-centered life of the child, the life of the 
adolescent is shot through with consciousness of self as related to 
other persons. His outlook is hetero-centric, not ego-centric. His 
behavior has constantly a social reference. He considers himself 
in relation to others.! 
So it is that on the social or volitional side, adolescents 
seek to attain their satisfactions and ends through associa- 
tions with fellow beings; through the exchange of human 
sympathies; through giving and receiving expressions of 
personal and social approval; through journeys and trips 
of exploration and adventure into realms of knowledge and 
activity hitherto unfamiliar; through utilizing the powers 
of organization to form more or less permanent associations 
and more or less stable institutions; through exercising the 
power of leadership and of codperation in order to attain the 
ends conceived to be desirable; through mounting to desired 
heights of ambition by the sheer exercise of will and the power 
of dominance. And yet, through every undertaking and 
scheme projected by the adolescent, runs the idea of good 
form, of adherence to the rules of the game as established by 
the group recognized as possessing the authority, and of a 
1In Monroe’s Principles of Secondary Education, pages 272-273.
-P-A-G-E-46
36 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
more or less literal adherence to convention when the con- 
vention has been imposed. 
RAPID DEVELOPMENT THE CHARACTERISTIC 
OF THE ADOLESCENT PERIOD 
In general, therefore, “adolescence is a period of marked 
and significant developmental growth —a growth of body 
and mind.” ! It varies notably in its time of appearance 
among youths but, for the most part, occurs somewhere 
between the age of twelve and fifteen. It ushers in a period 
of life replete with potentialities of many types. It is a 
period of great promise as well as one of much disquietude. 
It marks a rebirth of the individual, a flowering of nature, 
a seedtime of destiny. In the language of the poet, it is the 
time when youths are “standing with reluctant feet where 
the brook and river meet.”’ Rousseau says with respect to 
it: “We are born twice: once to exist and again to live; 
once as regards the individual and again as a sociws and as 
regards the race.”” The Scriptural admonition, “Ye must 
be born again,” could aptly be applied to it, for surely one 
is very literally, at this time, born anew. 
On its disquieting side, the period is one fraught with 
many hidden dangers. It isa time when the human organism 
is torn by conflicting forces; when racial instincts of untold 
power contend for mastery; when sex urgings rage and call 
for satisfactions; and when, as the Germans have it, the 
individual is tossed upon a sea of “storm and stress.” It is, 
moreover, the traditional seedtime for wild oats; the period 
when “the call of the wild” finds ready responses; the time 
when personal satisfactions are sought without accepting 
the responsibilities that rightly inhere in them; and the 
- traditional time for the removal of parental and school contro]

and the induction of the youth into the circle of enlarged 
personal freedom. 
The adolescent period is, therefore, a stage of development 
in which individual differences among youths are marked and 
multitudinous. Changes and readaptations are the very 
essences of their lives. As Crampton, speaking of the period, 
says: 
New mental abilities appear, while others disappear; the type 
of play changes; new companions are sought; new likings, tend- 
encies, enthusiasms, and emotions make up the whole of life. 
Old landmarks of life fade and new ones are eagerly sought... . 
The pubertal change leaves the child a wholly different being — 
different mentally, physically, morally, and ethically from the 
children in the state just left behind. 
The fundamental problem which lies before would-be 
reformers of secondary education — particularly of that 
part upon which the junior high school is focusing its atten- 
tion — is to determine, as clearly as possible, what the adoles- 
cent changes are; what their relationship to each other may 
be; what capacities, interests, and powers peculiar to adoles- 
cents and near-adolescents exist; and what methods of 
organization and administration of schools will produce the 
most valuable results for them. The previous sketch 
indicates what some of the most important of the adolescent 
characteristics are. Recent studies seem to indicate clearly 
that there is a close positive correlation between scholarship 
and adolescence,? and that wisdom dictates the segregation 
of adolescent children from the younger children in school, 
inasmuch as “the approach to the subject matter [is] differ- 
ent for the immature and the mature.”

  40 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
WHAT THE SCHOOL MUST GIVE TO THE ADOLESCENT PUPIL 
The practical school reforms which the analysis of adoles- 
cent characteristics seems to suggest as desirable will be 
discussed in detail in succeeding chapters. However, a brief 
consideration of some of these implications is appropriate 
here. Among the suggestions are: 
(1) Attention to the structure, arrangement, sanitation, and 
equipment of the building. As yet no particularized standard- 
ized form of a junior high school building has been devised. 
Such may never be desirable. In planning for junior high 
school pupils, however, the motto might very wisely be: 
“The best is none too good.” To dedicate to their use a 
structure abandoned for high school purposes because of 
its inconveniences, insanitation, and general antiqueness is to 
defeat the very ends for which a junior high school should be 
established. Attractive physical surroundings have an 
especially strong influence on pre-adolescent and adolescent 
youths. Such a building should possess all the features 
necessary to carry out a program of work suited to the needs 
of adolescents. What a program of this kind is to include 
will be considered in detail in a later portion of this book. 
Both building and program of studies are, however, but 
means to an end, — namely, that the educational objectives 
may be realized. The building, therefore, should not be 
erected on general architectural designs and the program of 
work be adapted to it, but rather the aims and purposes of 
the school as an institution should first determine what is 
to be taught, and this in turn should determine the form and 
character of the school plant. 
(2) Attention to instruction and training in matters of 
health. Personal and social hygiene, including instruction 
in sex functions and sex abuses, should be a subject of deep 
concern for all persons dealing with adolescents. Not only
-P-A-G-E-51
  FS eg ee RO RRS, eres ee 
ADOLESCENT CHARACTERISTICS 41 
should information regarding the best ways to preserve health 
be given young people, but they should likewise be so dis- 
ciplined in the practices which insure health that the infor- 
mation will function in life habits. To this end, provision 
for systematic training in physical education, gymnastics, 
and recreation should be made in every junior high school. 
This ideal, in turn, calls for adequate provision for play- 
_ grounds, athletic fields, gymnasiums, swimming pools, rest 
rooms, physical examination rooms, and doubtless other 
health agencies, together with a whole staff of health officials, 
including physical directors, supervisors of recreational 
activities, medical and dental inspectors, school nurses, and, 
possibly, other persons. 
(3) Provision for satisfying the migratory instinct. Among 
the agencies that can properly be employed to accomplish this 
end are: the school excursion; school field trips; hikes; 
and trips for the athletic teams, the debating teams, the 
musical clubs, and other school organizations. Conducted 
under proper chaperonage, with appropriate preliminary 
instruction and guidance and exacting subsequent reports, 
summarizings, and testings, few activities yield greater 
educational and moral values than these. 
(4) Provision against overstrain and overfatigue. Under 
this heading fall such. practical topics as those relating to 
the length of the class period, the school day, the school 
week, and the school year; the number and length of inter- 
mission periods within the school day; vacation periods; 
out-of-school study requirements; and similar matters. 
While no scientifically determined rules have yet been 
formulated to cover these items, current opinions of en- 
lightened educators seem to suggest the wisdom of the fol- 
lowing standards :
-P-A-G-E-52
  42 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
Class periods of from thirty-five to sixty minutes. 
A school day of five, six, seven, or possibly eight hours, 
divided into five, six, seven, eight or more class periods. 
A school week that shall include the occasional utilization 
of Saturday for excursions, hikes, games, and other forms 
of applied work and habit-forming recreation. 
A school year that makes provision for the proper use 
of a portion of the pupil’s time during the summer months. 
Similarly, enlightened opinion approves the policy of 
having short intermissions between class periods, with at 
least one longer rest period after each two or three periods, 
and only a limited amount of prescribed out-of-school study. 
(5) Sex segregation. The entire question of sex segregation 
in the various divisions of the school system is still so com- 
pletely engulfed in a sea of controversy that little more can 
be done here than to call attention to the importance of the 
problem and to mention possible modes of treatment. 
Simplest of all the solutions is, of course, to make no effort 
at sex segregation whatever. A second procedure is to 
segregate pupils in session rooms but not in class work. 
A third mode reverses the practice just mentioned and 
segregates pupils in class work but not in session rooms. A 
fourth plan provides for segregation within limited specified 
fields of study, but not in others; as, for illustration in 
science, practical arts work, and agriculture, but not in 
history, English, and language. A fifth scheme involves 
a separate building, organization, and staff for both boys and 
girls throughout the entire period of the junior high school. 
Much experimenting still needs to be done before positive 
recommendations can be made, and it is very probable that 
even then the conclusions will favor practices that shall 
differ with differing situations. 
(6) Teaching characterized by much enthusiasm and human 
—i.e., social — interest. No doubt all truly good teaching 
is the result, to a large degree, of a winning personality in
-P-A-G-E-53
    
  ADOLESCENT CHARACTERISTICS 43 
the teacher. Nor can it be denied that the human element 
and the human appeal are dominant factors in the teaching 
success of most individuals in all types of schools. Nowhere, 
however, do these two qualities — enthusiasm and the power 
to arouse human interest through appeals to the humanly 
interesting — play so important a part as in the instruction 
of adolescent boys and girls. As Koos putsit: “The dawn 
of social consciousness which accompanies the arrival of 
sex maturity is so much a matter of almost universal obser- 
vation as to leave little doubt in the minds of many thought- 
ful persons of its establishment as a fact.” ! 
And again, ‘““Whatever may be the complex of causes that 
are urging the quickening of the social consciousness, there 
can be little doubt of its existence in the early adolescent and 
there can be little question that it is accelerated by the ex- 
tensive physiological changes of some of which mention has 
been made.””! 
Whipple states the thought thus: “In the second, or 
pubertal and post-pubertal period, i.e., in the secondary school, 
instruction should take on a more personal and subjective 
tone and be presented with a strong ethical and social 
emphasis.” ? 
(7) Attention to the art of studying. Few pupils in school 
know how to study effectively. They need to be instructed 
in a manner more satisfactory than is generally done at the 
present time. In order to accomplish this purpose many 
forms of so-called supervised study have recently been 
advocated and practiced in various grades of the school. 
In some instances these efforts seem to yield gratifying 
results; in others the work is largely nominal and formal. 
Possibly continued experimenting will some time yield

-P-A-G-E-54
    AA JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
conclusions that can be formulated into rules of universal 
application. Such a time has not, however, yet arrived. 
The problem of correct supervised study seems to be how 
to assist pupils sufficiently and yet not too much in preparing 
their school work. Previous to the time when the junior 
high school period is reached, continued systematic study 
in a formal way is rare — and doubtless must be so. After 
the junior high school period is passed, pupils should, for the 
most part, be independent in their study. Only when en- 
tirely new divisions. of the subject matter are to be taken 
up and new modes of attack are to be required in dealing 
with them should there, seemingly, be any need for specific 
detailed direction of study in the senior high school years. 
In the junior high school, however, the character of the 
work, the maturity of the pupils, the purpose of the organiza- 
tion, and several other considerations all suggest the need 
for a carefully formulated and executed plan of study super- 
vision. Administrators must needs evaluate the merits of 
the several schemes that are being tested, and choose from 
among them. The single warning to be given is this: 
Adopt only a plan that is truly workable under the conditions | 
that necessarily must be imposed in the given school system.! 
(8) Provision for meeting the needs of accelerants and 
retardants. ‘The most conspicuous fact of adolescence is 
that of individual differences. To seek, therefore, to have 
any group of pupils — or indeed any two pupils — proceed 
at precisely the same rate of advancement, cover the same 
amount of work in precisely the same way, and attain results 
that are precisely alike is to ignore completely the lessons of 
psychology. A program of studies that is extensive in 
scope, some choice of subjects by pupils, and the employment 
of classroom methods that vary with the nature of the work 
1 For a rather extensive treatment of the subject, the reader is referred to 
Hall-Quest’s Supervised Study.
-P-A-G-E-55
  ADOLESCENT CHARACTERISTICS 45 
being taught, are practices that have originated in the 
facts of human unlikeness. These provisions, however, do 
not suffice. A more discriminating and complete recognition 
of the principle of individual differences is needed. At least 
three additional modes of meeting the problem are possible. 
These are: 
(a) By classifying pupils in the several sections of a given 
school course on the basis of their intelligence quotients 
and achievements. 
(b) By varying greatly the extent and nature of the school 
assignments made for the several pupils in the several 
class sections. 
(c) By promoting pupils by subjects at such times as 
their attainments warrant. 
Under the operation of the first scheme, pupils should be 
given one or more of the standardized intelligence tests; 
be judged by the teaching staff on a basis of actual attain- 
ments exhibited in a given subject; and be segregated into 
accelerated sections, normal sections, and retarded sections. 
In the interest of social welfare, it is doubtless best that no 
flaming advertisement of the proposed segregation be made. 
Neither should studied efforts at secrecy be tolerated. The 
principle of seeking to secure the greatest good to the greatest 
number justifies the procedure. 
On the other hand, the use of terms that tend to suggest 
invidious distinctions should be avoided. Careless reference 
to the “bonehead”’ section or to the “‘section of geniuses”’ 
should be avoided. Designating the several sections by 
letters or numbers and making the paths leading from one 
section to the others always open to all pupils upon equal 
terms, will do much to allay unfriendly criticism. Moreover, 
no suitable occasion should be allowed to pass for impressing 
on pupils and patrons alike the necessary and essential 
validity of the principle that the recognition of superior
-P-A-G-E-56
  46 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
  ability and the selection, for specialized services, of those 
individuals possessed of superior specialized abilities, is of 
the very essence of democracy. 
Assigning school work to individuals on the basis of their 
ability to accomplish results and permitting each pupil to 
advance as rapidly as his attainments warrant, or as slowly 
as his capacities necessitate, are likewise practices wholly 
in accord with the ideas of true democracy. Moreover, 
pupil advancement should be made in respect to each subject 
pursued and not by grouping all subjects together and 
making promotion depend on standard attainments in each 
and every one of the branches. It is a truism to say that 
individuals exhibit different degrees of interest and of progress 
in different subjects. There is no valid reason for insisting 
that none shall proceed in the work in which he is really 
efficient at no faster rate than he is compelled to proceed 
in the subjects in which he is less efficient. 
(9) Stimulating the emotions through dramatics, motion 
pictures, pageantry, and other forms of visual appeal. That 
the interest of boys and girls in undertakings of these kinds 
is strong is attested by the numbers who daily flock to the 
public amusement places where exhibits of the sort are 
presented. Whether the effects are good or bad depends, 
to a large degree, upon the character of the thing produced. 
The instinct that impels young people to suffuse their souls 
with the impressions derived from theatricals is a wholesome 
instinct. It arises from a desire to understand human char- 
acter the better, to know what problems and conditions 
confront fellow mortals, how they meet them, and what the 
effects upon them are. Dramatic representations are there- 
fore intensely socializing and humanizing in their influences. 
Moreover, just as a refinement in the intellectual nature 
takes place when new and larger intellectual experiences are 
had, so there occurs a development of the emotional nature
-P-A-G-E-57
ADOLESCENT CHARACTERISTICS 47 
from the crude, coarse, and vulgar into the artistic and 
sesthetic when new and enriched emotional experiences are 
had. The time to foster this development is when the 
instinct for esthetic culture is strong —a condition that 
characterizes youth. 
(10) Auditorium exercises. Oral readings, talks, lectures, 
impersonations, and other forms of personal appeal, force- 
fully and sympathetically made in connection with the 
auditorium or assembly exercises, leave lasting emotional 
effects upon young people. Perhaps at no time during 
the school day is so great an opportunity furnished to teachers 
for establishing lofty ideals of personal and social achieve- 
ment as is furnished by such exercises as these. No school 
can afford to omit or neglect them. They must, however, 
be vital to pupils’ interests and experiences. No mere 
“‘preachings” that deal with abstract principles, abstractly 
presented, are likely to do much good. On the other hand, 
they are apt to congeal the very fountains of idealism and 
to leave the child callous to the true appeals of the spirit. 
(11) Opportunity to express individuality through various 
forms of fine and applied art. Art is distinctively the product 
of the emotions. It is the result of an effort to realize 
more or less immediately an ideal that has taken shape in the 
mind and has had its vital elements deeply colored by the 
sentiments. To seek to actualize an ideal is to clarify it. 
Hence, for an individual to devise a plan of procedure 
involving an ideal and then to execute the plan is to enrich 
the emotional nature and to strengthen its powers. To 
sketch a pattern in the draughting room and to execute it in 
wood or iron in the manual training shops; to work out a 
recipe by formula in the school pantry and to test it in the 
school kitchen; to visualize a design in the art room and to 
produce it in colors in the studio; to acquire an auditory 
impression of a melody from the graphophone and to trans-
-P-A-G-E-58
48 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
pose it into a new selection on the piano or violin — these 
surely are accomplishments that are, to a high degree, 
educative. They likewise are forms of training that make 
a permanent appeal to the peculiar interests and needs of 
many types of adolescents. 
(12) Opportunity to satisfy religious yearnings. The 
public schools may not, probably, furnish direct instruction 
in conventionalized religion. If, however, religion is defined 
as Daniel Webster defined it, as “The tie that connects man 
with his Creator and holds him to His throne,” then religion 
is an attribute universal to mankind, and cannot be ignored. 
Youths of the adolescent stage of development are peculiarly 
sensitive to religious suggestions and influences. Their 
curiosity regarding life processes and cosmic forces is an 
expression of their search for God and for an understanding 
of the “tie”’ that connects man with him. For them, in an 
especial way, “life, exempt from public haunts, finds tongues 
in trees, books in running brooks, sermons in stones, and 
good [may it not be said, God ?] in everything.” 
It follows, therefore, that abundant opportunities should 
be afforded youths at this period of their development to 
satisfy this aroused religious interest as fully as possible by 
means of contacts with nature and the universe; by means 
of accounts respecting the religious aspirations and customs 
of the human race in its struggle to make adjustments to 
nature and the invisible powers; and by means of personal 
investigations into the realms of the mysteries in accordance 
with the peculiar bent and needs of each. These consider- 
ations give justification for the study of object lessons; nat- 
ural history; elementary science in all its varied forms; 
history and literature relating to religious experiences; art; 
music; and such other subjects as can be made to reveal 
immutable principles and disclose man’s recurring relation- 
ships to the forces of the universe.
-P-A-G-E-59
  ADOLESCENT CHARACTERISTICS 49 
(13) Opportunities for esthetic culture of a personal kind. 
With the beginning of adolescence comes frequently a pro- 
nounced sensitiveness to form, arrangement, and color in 
material things. Peculiarly noticeable are the ssthetic 
responses to the stimuli of sex. The animal instinct which 
seeks to display such personal charms as may be possessed 
is strong. Pride in-one’s physical strength and develop- 
ment; pride in one’s clothing and personal appearance; 
pride in one’s skill in combat and competitive sports — these 
are some of the forms which the newly aroused instinct takes 
on. Correlatively, admiration of physical perfection in 
others, sensitiveness to the styles and manners of associates, 
a shrinking from contact with the ugly and coarse in nature 
and among mankind, all find due expression. Here, then, 
is a most favorable time for inculcating a spirit of reverence 
for the human body; giving a knowledge of sex hygiene; 
establishing a repugnance for the obscene, vulgar, and filthy 
in one’s person and one’s surroundings; inciting a pride in 
seeking to express self in accordance with the principles of 
good form and good morals; encouraging chivalry and gal- 
lantry in the treatment of weaker associates. 
(14) Utilization of the social recitation. The primary 
purpose of a class meeting in school is not to afford the teacher 
opportunity to test the knowledge of pupils. It is to expand 
and clarify ideas already established, add new related ideas, 
interpret facts, integrate details into a consistent complex, 
formulate valid and workable principles of thought and 
action based on the accepted data, apply laws to specific 
problems, and give pupils practice in thinking, feeling, and 
acting in typical social situations. As schools are too often 
conducted at present, the aims just enumerated are not 
realized. The class period is chiefly a drill period or a testing 
period, in which the teacher assumes the leading réle and in 
which the teacher’s ways and methods dominate. The
-P-A-G-E-60
50 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
pupils themselves receive little encouragement to initiate 
processes or to develop them in accordance with their 
own interests, powers, and experiences. 
In place of the set formal recitation, the class exercise 
can much more profitably take on the character of a group 
conversation. Why, indeed, should our school practices 
differ so notably from the procedure of -home, business, and 
society? If conversation is the means employed in these 
associations in order to gain and impart a large portion of 
the information desired and needed, why is not the practice 
desirable in the schoolroom ? 
(15) Segregation of pupils into homogeneous groups. This 
principle is repeatedly suggested by the study of adolescent 
characteristics and perhaps is the most fundamental of all 
for any truly organized junior high school. The old maxim, 
“Birds of a feather flock together,” is observable in all 
activities of youth. The common element binds the groups 
together — common interests, attainments, stages of develop- 
ment. It is unnatural for boys and girls to be attached 
intimately to groups composed of much older or much 
younger boys and girls. The feeling of kind is especially 
strong at the pre-pubescent and pubescent stages. Then 
the “gang” instinct expresses itself in a conspicuous manner. 
Clubs, societies, and associations founded on the mutual 
likes and dislikes of their members are numerous. Fre- 
quently the chronological ages of the individuals composing 
the organizations differ considerably, but rarely is there any 
great discrepancy in psychological ages. The more mature 
individuals, as well as the less mature, neither desire member- 
ship in the association nor are wanted by the homogeneous 
group. Such individuals find greater satisfactions in asso- 
ciations of their own. 
Accepting these facts as guides, the idea immediately 
obtrudes that a three-year unit for school organization is
-P-A-G-E-61
ADOLESCENT CHARACTERISTICS 51 
better than a six-year unit; that admission to any given unit 
of school work should not rest solely upon the psychological 
or the physiological age of the pupil, but upon a consideration 
of the facts of both these factors; and that ample provision 
should be made for youths to exercise extensively the gang 
instinct. Applied specifically to the junior high school, 
this principle suggests the need for admitting pupils who are 
physiologically mature but who, perchance, are psychologi- 
cally retarded; for segregating pupils into home rooms in 
which the constituency is determined by likeness of interests 
and attainments; for encouraging the boy and girl scout 
organizations; for developing school clubs and societies of 
various types; for introducing at least a modicum of self- 
determination and self-government in the school disciplinary 
agencies; and for making proper provision for accelerants 
and retardants in arranging and administering class sections. 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
CHAPTER FOUR 
Four Aims oF THE REFORM 
HE reform movement that has led to the establish- 
ment of the junior high school has aimed above all 
things: first, to humanize the education of adolescents; 
second, to economize school time; third, to prevent unnec- 
essary withdrawals; and fourth, to further the cause of 
democracy in education. 
FIRST AIM: TO HUMANIZE THE EDUCATION OF ADOLESCENTS 
The period from twelve to fifteen years of age is a period of 
pronounced idealism. Aspirations relating to life careers, 
life pleasures, life responsibilities are stirring; plans are be- 
ing formed; habits are becoming established. Of all the 
periods of school life, this is the one when attention to the 
refinements of the emotional nature can be made to yield 
the best results and will guarantee the most lasting bene- 
fits. There are various means by which such results and 
benefits may be secured. 
(1) Excursions into new fields of human interest. Adoles- 
cents are notoriously fickle in their interests. They like- 
wise are excessively curious about new things and are eager 
to explore them. In order to call forth their interest chil- 
dren should be given abundant opportunities for becoming 
acquainted with special fields of knowledge and with various 
trades and skills. To do this demands not only that pupils 
shall be given freedom to choose subjects for study, but also 
that no important field of human interest shall be left un- 
known to them while they are making their selections. If 
education consists of building expert knowledge and skill 
upon foundations of general knowledge and skill, then, truly, 
no more fitting time appears for deepening and strength- 
52
-P-A-G-E-63
  FOUR AIMS OF THE REFORM o3 
ening these foundations than during the inquiring age of 
adolescence. 
(2) Introductory courses. Not only should each impor- 
tant branch of knowledge find a place in the junior high school, 
but the approach to each new field of thought should be by 
way of general introductory courses. Psychology has es- 
tablished the law that the mind first takes note of the more 
. conspicuous factors of any given complex, and subsequently 
lays hold of the more refined elements. It follows, then, 
that the first consideration given to unfamiliar subject mat- 
ter should be general in its nature. Outlooks and overviews 
are what should be sought, not mastery of specialized and 
limited portions of the subject. The large and fundamental 
aspects of a subject should be studied, touched upon lightly, 
and passed over with no attempt at completeness of pres- 
entation. The plea for this ideal is in no wise a defense of 
inaccuracy and vagueness. It is a plea for learning a few 
fundamental things well, and postponing specialized courses 
to a later period in the school course. This principle justi- 
fies courses like Introductory Science, General Mathematics, 
World History, and try-out work in connection with indus- 
trial, commercial, and household subjects, in place of the 
more particularized courses not infrequently to be found in 
schools. 
(3) A system of guidance. With all his tendencies toward 
individualism and his efforts to discover his own elements 
of strength and weakness through independent choices and 
procedures, the adolescent is a being who needs the advice 
and guidance of sympathetic teachers. Only broad-minded, 
tactful, forceful teachers, who have lived lives filled with 
rich experiences, who can win the complete confidence and 
respect of pupils, and who are possessed of a peculiar love for 
boys and girls, can hope to make much of a success in a 
junior high school. wd
-P-A-G-E-64
  o4 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
(4) Use of concrete material in teaching. The employment 
of the inductive method of approach in presenting unfamiliar 
subjects, and the use of many concrete illustrations in order 
to explain the facts and principles involved, are nowhere 
more important than in junior high school. From the 
known facts to the unknown ones; from the immediately 
interesting to the more remotely valuable; from the specific 
thing to the general concept; from the manifestation of the 
law to the abstract formulation thereof ;— these are but a 
few of the pedagogical maxims which have been repeatedly 
advocated but all too commonly neglected. What is needed 
in the junior high school is not the unmodified use of the 
methods of the elementary school, with its emphasis largely 
upon memory work and formal processes of technique; nor 
is it the adoption of the university custom of stressing scien- 
tific and philosophical relationships and the establishment 
of wholly independent judgments; rather is it the skillful 
employment of such interrelating data as can be educed from 
the experiences of the pupils, developed by means of class 
discussions and textbook contributions, and formulated in 
general concepts. Such considerations make desirable the 
organization of instruction on a departmental basis, since the 
quasi-specialist can alone be expected to have such a com- 
mand of subject matter as will enable him to correlate and 
to interpret it so as to make it appear vital to adolescents. 
(5) Projects of actuality. Adolescent boys and girls are 
particularly concerned with projects and the problems that 
arise in connection with them. They care little for the logi- 
cal organization of studies. School material is of much 
greater interest and is the better comprehended when it is 
employed by pupils to help in gaining an end formulated and 
clearly understood by themselves. The junior high school 
age is distinctively the age in which the desire to propose 
and execute projects is strong. School administrators
-P-A-G-E-65
  FOUR AIMS OF THE REFORM 55 
should, therefore, utilize to the fullest possible degree this 
powerful natural stimulus, and should furnish material upon 
which it may express itself in connection with the regular 
work of the school. 
(6) Personal influence. In the traditional elementary 
school, adolescent boys and girls, just coming into their 
social inheritances in a conscious way, have been unwisely 
limited in their social contacts with adults. One teacher 
has usually dominated their lives during an entire school 
year. Except as teachers of special subjects have visited 
the classrooms and as supervisors have briefly appeared, 
pupils have had the impress of no adult influence, save one, 
from morning to night, week in and week out. This con- 
dition is regrettable. However forceful the personality of 
the teacher may be, a single influence working upon the im- 
pressionistic years of youths is weakening. Particularly 
. unfortunate is the absence of the masculine influence. 
Adolescents admire physical vigor, moral courage, resource- 
fulness, strong mentality, and altruistic sentiments. More- 
over, the masculine element in the world grips their imagina- 
tion with power. As the schools are organized at present, 
too little of the masculine influence is exerted upon them. 
Rarely is a man of any type found teaching in the seventh 
and eighth grades of the traditional schools. More rarely 
is a vigorous, forceful, aggressive man found there. The 
feminine influence, with all its many excellent qualities, can- 
not make up the deficiencies inherent in a situation of this 
kind. What, therefore, is demanded is a balanced staff of 
men and women, all possessed of the essential qualities of 
personality which make so vital an appeal to adolescent 
boys and girls. 
No doubt all truly good teaching is the result, to a large — 
degree, of a winning personality in the teacher. Nor can it” 
be denied that the human element and the human appeal are
-P-A-G-E-66
  56 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
dominant factors in the teaching success of most individuals 
in all types of schools. Nowhere, however, do these two 
qualities — enthusiasm and the power to arouse human in- 
terest through appeals to the humanly interesting — play 
so important a part as in the instruction of adolescent boys 
and girls. As Emerson said, the only way to arouse human 
interests and enthusiasms among pupils is to exhibit human 
traits and enthusiasm in oneself. Hence it follows that if 
these qualities are to characterize the work of the school, 
they must first be inspired by the teacher. No one, there- 
fore, should be permitted to teach in the junior high school 
who has not an abundance of physical energy and enthu- 
siasm, and is not possessed of the ability to make the class- 
room work vital and interesting. This ideal doubtless de- 
mands that the so-called socialized recitation shall be the 
accepted mode of class procedure, and that free discussion 
by pupils shall be constantly encouraged. 
(7) A program of studies of ample scope. The traditional 
program, with its stress upon formal studies, many of which 
have previously occupied the attention of the pupils, does not 
meet the demands of twentieth-century educational ideals. 
If pupils of diverse interests are to be encouraged to continue 
in school, then subject matter that makes an appeal to their 
several needs and interests must be provided. This can 
only be accomplished by a program of studies enriched far 
beyond the narrow confines of the old-type curriculum. 
(8) Practice in well-doing. If the ultimate purpose of 
education is to develop moral character among men, and if 
moral character consists essentially of acts performed rather 
than of the ideas and sentiments which give rise to them; 
then, truly, making provision for practice in well-doing is one 
of the chief functions of a school. Adolescents or adults 
may be possessed of the loftiest ideals and an abundance of 
information and yet fall short of utilizing either group of
-P-A-G-E-67
FOUR AIMS OF THE REFORM 57 
forces in an effective way. Knowledge and exercise are 
but means to ends; the ends are ability to play one’s part 
in the world, and ability to play it well. In other words, 
the ends to be sought in education are culture and character. 
To secure these ends, practice in transforming knowledge 
into power must be obtained. One of the striking facts re- 
vealed by psychology in recent years is that the transforma- 
tion of knowledge into power and the transfer of power to 
unnumbered new fields of interest do not take place automati- 
cally. Unless the process has been suggested by another and 
the pupil has actually made use of the suggestion, there is 
no guarantee that the transformation and transfer will ever 
occur. ‘As the twig is bent, the tree’s inclined.”’ Nor is 
the twig bent by mere suggestion or word of command. Only 
as action — repeated action — follows the dictum, does a 
habit eventuate. 
Hence it follows that if full account is to be taken of the 
adolescent instinct to act in practical ways, provision must 
be made for action. To this end, various forms of student 
self-governing agencies, codperative ventures, pre-voca- 
tional skills, citizenship activities, recreational practices, and 
undertakings that tend to bring out in pupils qualities of 
leadership and initiative (and likewise of submissiveness to 
established law and authority) should be afforded boys and 
girls whenever experience shows they can profit by them. 
Particularly important are these considerations for pupils 
of the junior high school age; in part because the native 
instincts run so strongly in these directions during this age, 
and in part because many pupils will have no future oppor- 
tunity for securing it. 
(9) Instruction based upon pupils’ experiences. In child- 
hood, the implanting of empirical facts must necessarily 
constitute the bulk of the instructional work of the school. 
In post-adolescence, the logical structure of the subject sug-
-P-A-G-E-68
58 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
gests the method to be followed. But, in the transition stage, 
neither the presentation of facts as isolated facts nor the de- 
velopment of a subject purely in a rationalistic manner can 
yield the best results. The experiences of boys and girls 
are necessarily limited. Their logical faculties are, except 
in rare instances, incapable of making sustained and 
involved analyses. The method to be employed with ado- 
lescents consists, therefore, of a combination of the em- 
pirical and the logical procedures. Appeals made to the 
immediately interesting, because the immediately interest- 
ing is related directly to concrete experience, are most 
effective in their results. The search among pupils’ experi- 
ences for foundations upon which to build; the selection 
of old-new material from the more mature and tested 
accumulations of the adult world; and the arrangement 
and adaptation of this material to fit the pupils’ needs — 
these are the peculiar tasks of the junior high school teacher. 
Correlation of facts with facts, ideas with ideas, experiences 
with experiences; translation of facts into faculties, ideas into 
ideals, powers into habits — these are the methods which 
operate in successful school work everywhere, but which 
have a particular function in the junior high school. 
SECOND AIM: TO ECONOMIZE SCHOOL TIME 
This motive, as has been shown, was notably strong at 
the outset of the reorganization movement. In the last 
few years, however, the idea has been submerged, if not 
wholly abandoned. It is a question whether the best in- 
terests of society and of boys and girls can be secured by re- 
ducing the period of liberalizing education. It is possible 
that greater benefits may be secured by enriching the pro- 
gram of studies and intensifying the training of pupils through- 
out the usual number of scholastic years. 
That the original notion of economy of time has not been
-P-A-G-E-69
  FOUR AIMS OF THE REFORM 59 
entirely sidetracked is shown by the introduction of the 
following resolution, presented by Director George N. 
Carmen of the Lewis Institute, Chicago, during the session of 
the North Central Association in March, 1922: ‘‘Resotvep, 
That it is the sense of this Conference that the normal period of 
secondary and college education shall include the time between 
the ages of twelve and twenty.” 1 As explained by Mr. Car- 
men, the resolution contemplated the completion of the 
junior and senior high school courses and the four years’ 
college course in a period of eight years, thus cutting two 
years from the time that is now ordinarily required to obtain 
a bachelor’s degree. The resolution failed of passage by a 
two to one vote. 
It is evident from this vote that the idea of economy in 
point of time still has its champions. In this connection, 
the following words, spoken by Dean Henry W. Holmes of 
the Graduate School of Education of Harvard University, 
are very interesting: 
I maintain that we ought not to consider rapid advancement 
the only possibility. To do so argues poverty of resources and 
ingenuity. Are we incapable of developing projects for the gifted ? 
. Because children are gifted shall we give them the old 
meager fare and ask them to eat it the faster? ‘‘ The hungry 
sheep look up and are not fed.” Better rapid advancement than 
dull hours such as many of us remember; but surely we can devise 
something better than either.? 
THIRD AIM: TO PREVENT UNNECESSARY WITHDRAWALS 
It is clear, first, that enormous losses of pupils from the 
schools take place particularly in grades seven and eight; 
second, that of those who finish the eighth grade only about 
one half to two thirds enter the high school; and, third, that 
1 Proceedings of the North Central Association, Part I, page 59, 1922. 
2 From an address before the National Society for the Study of Education, 
at Chicago, February, 1922.
-P-A-G-E-70
  60 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
of those who enter the high school only about 35 per cent to 
40 per cent remain longer than two years. 
It is this enormous school loss during the period of early 
adolescence that the junior high school has set out to reduce. 
That many causes operate to bring about the conditions 
mentioned, no one can doubt. The more common causes 
alleged to be responsible for the conditions may be analyzed 
(a) with reference to the situation in the seventh and eighth 
grades, (b) with reference to the situation in the ninth and 
tenth grades, and (c) with reference to the general situation 
found in all four grades. 
(A) Causes of Eliminations in the Seventh and Eighth Grades 
(1) Too little adaptation of the work to the needs of individual 
pupils. This topic will be discussed at greater length in 
another connection. Suffice it here to point out that rarely 
(and until very recently, indeed, only in the larger and most 
progressive systems) has any distinct provision been made, 
in these grades, for individuals of differing capacities, tastes, 
interests, and purposes. Precisely the same subjects were 
pursued by all, with precisely the same methods of teaching, 
and with precisely the same standards of promotion. The 
pupil whose racial inheritance of culture was slight received 
the same treatment as did the one whose racial inheritance 
of culture was great; the “practical-minded” or “motor- 
minded”’ individual was taken through the same course of 
training as was the one for whom more formal studies had 
an interest; the boy or girl with an alert intellect was held 
to the same course and to the same rate of progress as was 
the boy or girl of slow comprehension and slow mental 
processes. 
(2) Too little correlation of school work with out-of-school 
interests and experiences. This is an indictment that can
-P-A-G-E-71
  FOUR AIMS OF THE REFORM 61 
still be made against the teaching in all types of schools. 
If its effects are worse upon the pupils of the seventh and 
eighth grades than upon those in other divisions, this is due, 
doubtless, to the peculiar susceptibility of the pupils of those 
grades to the deadening effects of the formal and bookish 
type of teaching. Such methods are peculiarly reprehen- 
sible when employed with adolescent boys and girls. 
That the work of the seventh and eighth grades has in the 
past been largely of the formal type is evident when the sub- 
jects and the manner in which they were formerly taught 
are considered : 
(a) Reading — with stress on pronunciation, enunciation, 
and bodily posture. 
(b) Literature — limited to the study of a few books and 
these, for the most part, selected by scholarly adults because 
of their literary merit rather than because of their power to 
interest pupils and to help them to acquire a love of reading. 
(c) Grammar— consisting primarily of the memorizing of 
technical rules and the unmotivated application of these to 
isolated sentences and paragraphs. 
(d) Expression—chiefly written, and concerned with 
topics remote from the immediate experiences of the pupils. 
(e) Penmanship—not for the sake of conveying ideas, 
but to imitate a set model. 
(f) Spelling — not infrequently dealing with words rarely 
used in the everyday activities of the pupils. 
(g) Arithmetic—consisting of formal processes carried out 
in problems that are seldom found in social relationships. 
(h) History —confined to a consideration of events con- 
nected with our own land, and these largely of a political 
and governmental character. 
(7) Geography —an account of political divisions, with 
little attention to the physical, economic, and social elements 
related thereto. 
(j) Physiology — consisting of a study of the parts of the 
body, with slight attention to functions. 
(k) Science — conspicuous by its entire absence. 
(1) Practical Arts—if present at all, taught as exercises
-P-A-G-E-72
62 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
and with little relation to the practical experiences to which 
they relate. 
(m) Drawing —as a formal exercise. 
(n) Music—only rarely seeking to give pupils a real 
appreciation of musical forms and musical works. 
(0) Physical training— unmotivated exercises of gym- 
nastic types. | 
(p) Assembly exercises— listless reading and tedious talk. 
Is it any wonder that large numbers of pupils withdraw 
from school? Under the old régime, hungry souls were often 
starved, and unawakened souls remained asleep because the 
quickening forces were too feeble to arouse them. 
(3) Too little recognition of pupils’ sense of personality. 
It is sufficient here to note the failure of many school au- 
thorities to provide a school discipline for the seventh and 
eighth grades that differs at all from that employed for chil- 
dren of the lower grades; to provide adequate opportunities 
for social development among the pupils; or to give any 
recognition to their instinctive desire to initiate new under- 
takings and to participate in codperative works. 
The above mentioned causes are not the only ones operat- 
ing to bring about withdrawals in the grades mentioned, but 
they are notable ones. 
(B) Causes of Eliminations in the Ninth and Tenth Grades 
(1) Too abrupt a change in school work and in the demands 
made upon pupils. The location of the school building often 
encourages elimination. The transfer to a high school 
building located, it may be, one, two, or three miles from 
home affords an argument to an indifferent or lazy pupil for 
not attending school beyond the eighth grade. 
The change in subjects of study bewilders some children. 
In the elementary school, a pupil pursues a daily program 
that includes a dozen or more classified subjects of study.
-P-A-G-E-73
  FOUR AIMS OF THE REFORM - 63 
In the high school, he is expected to pursue subjects which 
are, for the most part, wholly strange to him. Unless the 
new subjects are presented in a very interesting and sym- 
pathetic manner, pupils are apt to become discouraged and 
to leave school altogether. 
Methods of recitation in the high school are new to the pupil. 
In the typical elementary school, recitation periods extend 
from ten to thirty minutes; in the high school they are gen- 
erally from forty to sixty minutes in length. In the elemen- 
tary school, a knowledge of isolated facts and forms often 
suffices; in the high school, stress is laid on relationships. 
In the elementary school, the question and answer method 
dominates; in the high school, the topical recitation is the 
ideal. 
Modes of study likewise differ. In the elementary school, 
short lesson assignments prevail; study is carried on within 
the school building, often under the direct supervision of the 
teacher; and little supplementary reading is exacted. In 
the high school, assignments are longer; little opportunity 
for study under supervision is provided; considerable col- 
lateral work is prescribed; and preparation of a portion of 
the tasks outside the school building is required. 
The discipline of the high school is a test in which many 
children fail. In the elementary school, pupils are largely 
governed by fixed rules. In the high school, a large degree 
of personal freedom and responsibility is granted. 
(2) Unsuitability of the typical ninth-grade course for many 
types of pupils. Notable changes have been made in the 
ninth-grade offerings in many schools during the last few 
years. Nevertheless,in most of the small schools, and in 
altogether too many of the larger ones, the curricular offer- 
ings are limited, and little personal choice of subjects is per- 
mitted to the pupil. No manual or household arts, no agri- 
culture, no commercial work, no design, no physical training
-P-A-G-E-74
  64 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
is to be found in the ninth grade in hundreds of schools. 
Moreover, the organization and administration of the work 
that is offered are remote in their appeals, formal in their 
methods, and ineffective in their results. Pupils finding little 
material that relates to the concrete experiences of their lives 
and seeing little practical value in the courses offered, often 
become discouraged, then indifferent, and finally withdraw 
altogether. 
FOURTH AIM: TO FURTHER THE CAUSE OF DEMOCRACY 
IN EDUCATION 
Professor C. H. Judd states the case thus: “The Junior 
High School has grown up in democratic America as the last 
chapter in the history of the struggle against the medizval 
system.” ! What this medizeval system was may best be 
understood by recalling the ideas which dominated a large 
part of European thought and practice previous to the 
World War. Medizeval society held to the belief in the 
divine ordination of certain individuals to be privileged char- 
acters in the world of affairs, and the condemnation of other 
individuals to positions of subjection. As a corollary of 
this belief, the claim was advanced that only the one class 
was entitled to a liberalizing education or could profit there- 
from. The other class was supposed to be happier and 
more serviceable to the world when kept in nearly total 
ignorance. 
This belief began to give way under the influence of the 
Protestant Reformation. Straightway the privileged classes 
formed a new line of defense by inaugurating a system of 
education that made provision for two types of schools — 
the one to furnish an elementary education for the masses; 
the other to furnish secondary and higher education for the 
14 Democratic School System, page 78.
-P-A-G-E-75
  FOUR AIMS OF THE REFORM 65 
classes. The one aimed to develop implicit faith in the es- 
tablished order of things, to inculcate respect for authority, 
to secure loyalty and obedience to the State and the Church, 
and to give training in menial occupations. The other aimed 
to give a liberal culture, a sense of personal superiority, and 
a training for the higher offices of State, Church, and the larger 
affairs of the world. The one was designed for the children 
of the common people, — i.e., the artisans, the peasants, the 
poor, and the socially submerged; the other was designed for 
the children of the aristocratic governing classes. This 
medieval system of schools, somewhat disguised, has existed 
in one form or another from the Middle Ages down to the 
present time. But gradually, the forces of privilege have 
given way, and the principles of democracy, involving as 
they do the idea of equal opportunities for all persons, with- 
out respect to conditions of birth, have taken precedence. 
The junior high school marks, as Professor Judd has stated, 
‘the last chapter in the history of the struggle.”
-P-A-G-E-76
  CHAPTER FIVE 
Way THE Srx-THREE-THREE PLAN Is RecomMMENDED 
N the previous chapters, some of the principles under- 
lying the demand for reform in the elementary and 
secondary schools of America have been presented, and cer- 
tain tentative and more or less general conclusions have been 
drawn. Inthe present chapter some of the specific arguments 
that favor the establishment of the junior high school are 
set forth. 
OBJECTIONS TO THE EIGHT-FOUR PLAN 
Obviously, whether or not eight years are longer than 
necessary for the work of the elementary school depends upon 
the nature and extent of the task which that school is expected 
to accomplish. No adequate formulation of the aims of 
elementary education has ever been made. In general, the 
idea seems to prevail that the purpose of the elementary 
school is not so much inculcation of knowledge as the estab- 
lishment of attitudes and processes of learning. As Dewey 
states it: 
The aim of the elementary school . . . should not be knowledge, 
but to organize the instincts and impulses of children into working 
interests and tools. The stress should be on methods, not results. 
Not that we do not want results, but that we get better results when 
we transfer the emphasis of attention to the problem of mental 
attitude and operation. We need to develop a certain active in- 
terest in truth and its allies, a certain disposition of inquiry, together 
with the command of the tools that make it effective, and to organize 
certain modes of activity in observation, construction, expression, 
and reflection. Six years ought to be enough to accomplish this 
task.!

  THE SIX-THREE-THREE PLAN 67 
For Hanus, the elementary school, besides guarding and 
promoting a child’s normal physical health, should aim: 
. . . to nourish the mind of the child through the course of study, 
which should comprise an orderly presentation of the whole field 
of knowledge in its elements, and to provide an opportunity for the 
exercise of all his powers — mental, moral, esthetic, manual or 
constructive — through good instruction and wise discipline.* 
Formerly, when the school year consisted of three, four, or 
five months in the winter season, when attendance during 
that short period was irregular, when teachers were inade- 
quately prepared, textbooks scarce and ill-adapted to pupils’ 
needs, supervision almost wholly wanting, and agencies for 
fortuitous education limited and weak, eight or more years 
devoted to the acquisition of even the rudiments of an edu- 
cation were none too long and the attainments none too 
gratifying. | 
Under conditions existing in most sections of the United 
States, with the school year extending over eight, nine, or 
ten months, with compulsory attendance laws in effect in 
every state, with improved texts, improved equipment, im- 
proved methods of teaching and of supervision, and with 
libraries, newspapers, magazines, lectures, motion pictures, 
and opportunities for social intercourse afforded in scores of 
ways unknown to earlier generations, there would seem to 
be little justification for devoting so many as eight years to 
elementary education. Mr. O. C. Schwiering is authority 
for the following significant statement: 
Application of the standard tests, such as Courtis’s Arithmetic, 
Kelley’s Silent Reading, and Gray’s Oral Reading tests, goes to 
show that little progress is made in the mechanical mastery of the 
common branches in the last two grades (of the eight-year elementary 
school) .? 
1 Educational Aims and Educational Values, page 17. 
2 Wyoming School Journal, page 222, 1919. 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
68 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
Mr. Schwiering then asks the pertinent question : 
If proficiency is attainable at the end of the sixth year in these 
common branches, why should we continue to emphasize them as 
. the main studies in the last two years? Why should we not strive 
for this proficiency at the end of the sixth grade and add prevoca- 
tional and secondary subjects to the curriculum of these two years? 
The investigations of other educators bear out Mr. Schwier- 
ing’s assertions and lend added weight to his queries. 
The elementary school is America’s common school — the 
school in which common facts, common ideas, common pro- 
cesses are presented in a common manner to all pupils. The 
expected outcome is a common body of ideals, common in- 
terests, common attitudes, common habits, common likes 
and dislikes, among all youthful citizens. The aim here is 
primarily to build on common foundations and to integrate 
individuality into a common national type of citizen. If the 
task can be adequately performed in six years, it is folly to 
consume more time and to encroach upon the rights of in- 
dividualism as sought in a differentiated type of training. 
A mass of evidence goes to prove that an elementary course 
of six years is adequate. If a period longer than six years 
is being employed by school administrators, one of three con- 
clusions must follow: (1) the elementary school is being 
made to bear burdens and undertake forms of instruction 
that rightfully do not belong to it; or, (2) the organization 
and administration of the work provided are imperfect, if 
not wholly out of harmony with twentieth century educational 
principles; or, (3) the standards of attainment are too high 
for practical realization. 
Whether or not four years are sufficient in which to give 
an adequate secondary school training depends on the aims 
and standards established. Secondary schools with two- 
year courses are not unknown, while, on the other hand, 
nine years have for generations been the recognized length
-P-A-G-E-79
  
THE SIX-THREE-THREE PLAN 69 
of the course of study pertaining to certain types of second- 
ary schools in European countries. Formerly, the American 
secondary school, even the public secondary school, was es- 
sentially a select school, serving primarily members of the 
privileged classes in society and being directed, if not dom- 
inated, by college and university ideals and interests. That 
condition no longer prevails. 
Under the older régime, when a fixed and narrow aim was 
established for the secondary schools, when the teaching 
material was limited in quantity, and when results were 
measured in formal terms, four years served fairly well to 
accomplish the task imposed on the secondary schools. In 
the present era, with teaching material multiplied many 
fold, with specific objectives increased from one or two to 
a half dozen or more, with the avowed purpose of the school 
changing from the task of developing revealed talents to 
that of promoting the “discovery”’ as well as the “develop- 
ment” of each pupil’s “dominant interests and powers,” 
with a refinement of ideals and an elevation of standards, 
four years are proving an inadequate period in which to 
perform the task laid upon the high schools. Either the 
demands on the secondary schools must be reduced or the 
time allotted to them for carrying on their work must be in- 
creased. As the first of these plans is not feasible, the con- 
clusion follows that the period of time must be increased. 
The democratic principle of equality of opportunity for 
all is largely responsible for the movement to establish a 
six-year period of secondary education. But the ideal of 
equality of opportunity in education is rapidly coming to 
mean not a like training for all, but a training appropriate to 
each pupil’s interests, needs, and capacities. Today, the 
ideal high school is a school of liberal culture, where the task 
is first to discover in pupils their real interests and powers; 
second, to nourish their spiritual life by guiding them into
-P-A-G-E-80
70 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
an elementary knowledge of the facts, truths, and laws of 
relation in a wide range of subjects; and third, to train them 
to interpret facts, to apply truths, and to perceive the laws 
of relation in a manner that will enable them to solve the 
problems of life. 
REVISED THEORY OF MENTAL DISCIPLINE 
The belief that exercising the mind produces increased 
mental power has long been held by philosophers and edu- 
cators. That the process whereby this increased mentality 
is secured is a simple and determinative one is not so convinc- 
ingly established. It is unnecessary here to enter into an 
account of the controversy respecting the dogma of formal 
discipline or to enumerate the arguments. The main tenets 
of the older and the newer schools of thought may, however, 
be briefly indicated. 
(1) The older conception 
(a) The chief value in education consists not in the ac- 
quisition of knowledge but in the process of acquiring it. 
(b) A few studies are as valuable as many in furnishing 
an education. 
(c) Formal studies, lending themselves to more compact 
forms of organization and lacking the weaknesses connected 
with masses of concrete and distracting details, constitute 
more desirable material for education than content studies. 
(dq) Training is general, and intellectual power acquired 
in connection with one set of material is transferable with 
little loss and is usable in connection with entirely new and 
unrelated sets of material. 
(2) The new conception 
(a) Knowledge and intellectual power are.inseparable, 
the former being an essential medium by means of which the 
latter develops and expresses itself. 
(b) Mental discipline is essentially specific in character 
and hence assumes many forms.
-P-A-G-E-81
  THE SIX-THREE-THREE PLAN 71 
(c) Many and varied studies furnish more usable data for 
the mind than can a few formal ones. 
(d) Transfer of power is secured only under ascertainable 
limitations, depending upon the likeness of elements and 
processes involved. 
(e) It is uneconomical to seek first to fashion the mind and 
then later to furnish it, since, by a judicious selection of sub- 
ject matter and of methods, useful knowledge and function- 
ing powers may be secured simultaneously. 
Thus it appears that the dogma of formal discipline is 
neither wholly proved nor disproved. It is, however, now 
less generally accepted as a guide for school administration 
than formerly. Out of the discussions regarding it has come, 
as Briggs says: 
. a general disbelief in the old faith that power developed in 
one field automatically and inevitably is exercised in all other fields. 
The faith that “discipline” of the mind or spirit is secured 
by work that is distasteful also finds few defenders today.! 
Necessarily, therefore, a rejection, even in part, of the 
doctrine of formal training carries with it a demand for a 
reorganization of the subject matter and methods of school 
work, and particularly for less attention to merely formal 
studies. 
CHANGED CONCEPTION OF CULTURE 
The culture of the mind and of the personality has for ages 
past been the declared purpose of collegiate education and 
of the upper stages of secondary and elementary school 
training. 
Three views of culture can be outlined. 
(1) The original idea. This view implied a knowledge and 
a training that enabled a person to comprehend the interests, 
activities, and possibilities of the society of his own time and 
to participate effectively in the undertakings of his col- 
1 Briggs, T. H., The Junior High School, page 10.
-P-A-G-E-82
  72 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
leagues. The process whereby this culture was attained con- 
sisted chiefly of a linguistic, literary, and historical study of 
the ancient peoples whose lives and achievements were re- 
garded as having approached nearest the ideals of perfec- 
tion. Having drunk from the very sources of idealism and 
having become intoxicated with the spirit of progress and 
altruism, each new disciple tried to employ his learning and 
skill in reshaping the ideas, ideals, and practices of his own 
time and community. The good citizen was one who, a 
scholar himself, participated in an active and scholarly way 
in the public activities of his generation. 
(2) Decadence. In decadence, the means of culture be- 
came the ends themselves. The ideal became not knowl- 
edge and power acquired for the sake of aiding in the improve- 
ment of society, but a critical knowledge of ancient language 
and literature without reference to their bearings on contem- 
porary problems and institutions. The good citizen thus 
was one who stood aloof from the active affairs of common 
men and prided himself on a culture that others did not 
possess. 
(3) The contemporaneous idea. In our own day, the origi- 
nal idea of culture has been restored and elaborated. To 
be liberally educated is to be at once possessed of a certain 
knowledge, to have a certain amount of training, and to 
possess a desire to interest oneself in all worthy undertak- 
ings that relate to the time and community in which one 
lives and to participate effectively in the solution of the prob- 
lems incident to them. ‘To this end, no contributing source 
of knowledge or power is left unexplored or unemployed 
as a means of equipping the individual for his tasks. 
Perhaps the famous characterization of a liberal education 
given by Huxley approaches nearest to the modern concep- 
tion of what is meant by culture in its contemporaneous 
sense :
-P-A-G-E-83
  THE SIX-THREE-THREE PLAN 13 
That man, I think, has had a liberal education who has been so 
trained in youth that his body is the ready servant of his will, and 
does with ease and pleasure all the work that, as a mechanism, it is 
capable of; whose intellect is a clear, cold, logic engine, with all its 
parts of equal strength and in smooth working order, ready, like a 
steam engine, to be turned to any kind of work, and spin the gos- 
samers as well as forge the anchors of the mind; whose mind is 
stored with a knowledge of the great and fundamental truths of 
nature, and of the laws of her operations; one who, no stunted 
ascetic, is full of life and fire, but whose passions are trained to come to 
heel by a vigorous will, the servant of a tender conscience; who 
has learned to love all beauty, whether of nature or art, to hate all 
vileness, and to respect others as himself. Such an one, and no 
other, I conceive has had a liberal education, for he is, as completely 
as man can be, in harmony with nature.! 
More recently Frederick M. Davenport has expressed the 
present idea, in relation to the work of the upper grades of 
the elementary school and of the junior high school : 
How to make the first six years of elementary education more 
effective in time and knowledge and inspiration; how to hold the 
boys and girls of fourteen in school a little longer until they learn 
what it is to be Americans and what working niche in the world 
they are best fitted to fill— that is the problem. Reading, writing, 
figuring, and spelling, of course, in a more effective practical way ; 
and physical training beyond the dream of Athens. But something 
also about the stars, and birds, and trees, and real things of many 
sorts in science and literature and language and art and music; 
and the history of institutions and the economic and social happenings 
of common men. But, of the old discipline, only that is to be re- 
tained which will freely and fully energize the mind for service in the 
present age and give it practical vision and enthusiasm and power.? 
PRACTICES IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES 
The form of school organization in other lands is decidedly 
different from that in America. The United States is the 
1 Huxley, T., “‘A Liberal Education,” in Lay Sermons and Addresses, 
pages 34, 35. ; 
2 Davenport, F. M., “Revolutionary Tendencies in the School Systems 
of the United States,” in The Outlook, pages 59 et seq., 1917.
-P-A-G-E-84
  74 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
only country in the world that has the eight-four organiza- 
tion. Still, as Briggs says: “It does not follow, however, 
that it is bad for our Republic with its peculiar democratic 
ideals and economic conditions.” ! 
A detailed account of the school systems of foreign coun- 
tries would be inappropriate here. Nevertheless, a considera- 
tion of the recent efforts of certain foreign school adminis- 
trators to render more effective the training of boys and girls 
from twelve to fifteen years of age is very instructive. These 
efforts have, for the most part, taken place within the last 
two decades. 
The political and educational philosophy which dominates 
life in Europe and Asia differs from that which prevails in 
America. Social arrangements are more definite and fixed 
than with us. Notonly is society stratified, but every instru- 
ment of government has, with rare exceptions, operated to 
perpetuate class distinctions, rather than to obliterate them. 
The result is that two — sometimes three — distinct kinds of 
schools exist in many foreign states: (1) the common elemen- 
tary school for the children of the masses whose destiny in life 
is to occupy positions more or less servile; (2) secondary 
schools open only to children of the superior social and offi- 
cial classes and administered in such a manner as to exclude 
individuals who do not belong to those classes; and (3) a 
hybrid type of school designed for the children of the so- 
called middle classes. Thus, under the European school 
system, there is, with rare exceptions, no common school 
for all individuals to attend from early childhood to the age 
of sixteen or eighteen. Instead of America’s single-trunk 
system, foreign countries employ a system which differentiates 
instruction within separate schools; not, as with us, by means 
of distinct curricula and courses, within a common school. 
Nevertheless, since the World War the educational trend 
1 The Junior High School, page 5.
-P-A-G-E-85
    
THE SIX-THREE-THREE PLAN 75 
in Western Europe has been toward a more democratic con- 
ception of social life, and hence educational leaders have 
sought in various ways to embody this idea in their school 
systems. As yet, these efforts can scarcely be regarded as 
having attained permanent results; but they give promise 
of many notable changes. The foreign school situation may 
be set forth briefly. 
(A) England 
(1) A common elementary school of seven (or eight) 
standards or years. 
(2) Intermediate schools of two main types, namely : 
(a) Higher elementary schools of three years. 
(b) Central schools of three years. 
(3) Secondary schools of many types and varied duration. 
(4) Technical schools. 
(5) Universities. 
The following sentences taken from Sandiford’s Compara- 
tive Education give a suggestion of the aims and work of the 
intermediate schools : 
The Higher Elementary Schools in England are designed for those 
pupils who can continue their education beyond the minimum pro- 
vided in the elementary schools but who have no desire to enter the 
university preparatory secondary schools. ‘These schools seek to 
give a higher elementary education to pupils from twelve to fifteen 
years of age — the age of the junior high school pupils in America. 
The curriculum consists of modern foreign language, science, 
elementary mathematics, English language and literature, history 
and geography, and “special instruction bearing on the future 
occupations of the scholars, whether boys or girls.” 4 
The Central Schools likewise take pupils of the ages twelve 
to fifteen and seek to offer them a more elastic curriculum 
adapted to local industrial needs. To quote Sandiford once 
more : 
1 Sandiford, P., Comparative Education, pages 220-221.
-P-A-G-E-86
76 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
The curricula of the Central Schools have a commercial or in- 
dustrial bias, or both. . . . In the commercial course, the branches 
studied include a foreign language, . . . science, including laboratory 
work, drawing, handicraft for boys, housecraft for girls, shorthand, 
bookkeeping, typewriting, English, history, geography, mathematics, 
singing, and physical exercises. In general, the pupils are not 
specifically trained to be clerks or stenographers . . . but under- 
lying principles are taught which have wide application in commerce 
and transportation. ‘The content of the subjects is modified to suit 
the probable vocations of the pupils, and the practical side of the 
studies, especially in mathematics, drawing, and the foreign language, 
is emphasized. 
The industrial course is less well defined and much experimenting 
is taking place. . . . Vocational skill is not aimed at, but the 
development of industrial intelligence is kept to the fore. The 
curricula vary. In general, it may be said that practical work in 
science, drawing, clay-modelling, woodwork, and metal work forms 
the basis for boys, and in science, domestic economy, drawing, and 
needlework for girls. ‘The modern language usually finds no place. 
History, geography, and other general subjects are the same as in 
the commercial courses, but are usually approached from a different 
angle. The history and organization of industries and the influence 
of inventions, for example, invariably form part of the history course.! 
Speaking of the Fisher Act of 1918, Dr. James F. Hosic 
writes as follows: 
The effect of the bill is clearly to develop a new sense of the 
importance of a national system of education which shall equalize 
the opportunities for all children by providing first-rate facilities 
everywhere, with differentiation of courses as the period of actual 
employment approaches. England is at last providing the single, 
unified school organization which the ideals of the Protestant 
Revolt and democratic movement of the Renaissance called for. 
In the provision for day continuation schools with compulsory 
attendance to sixteen and the supervision and inspection of all 
schools, private and parochial, as well as public or “‘ board” schools, 
she is in advance of America.?

(B) France 
(1) Primary school, six years in length. 
(2) Higher primary school, one, two, or three years in 
length. 
(3) Secondary schools : 
(a) For boys, with school course of seven years. 
(b) For girls, with school course of five years. 
(4) Technical schools: 
(a) Primary technical schools, articulating with the 
common primary school. 
(b) Middle technical schools, open to boys between 
the ages of fifteen and seventeen. 
(ec) High technical schools, affording instruction of 
a collegiate grade. 
(5) Universities. 
Of the types of schools mentioned, four concern them- 
selves with pupils of the ages twelve to fifteen, and hence 
these schools have particular interest for the junior high 
school administrator in America. These four schools are: 
the higher primary, the secondary for boys, the secondary 
for girls, and the primary technical. 
The higher primary school is designed so that 
. children who are not required immediately to earn money 
may carry further their general education and a certain amount of 
hand and eye training. ... The first year’s course is the same for 
all pupils. With the second year, specialization begins, and there 
are four courses to choose from: general (i.e., literary, the course 
taken by candidates for the teaching profession); commercial; 
industrial; and agricultural. ... To all schools certain subjects 
are common, such as morals, handwriting, history, civics, physics 
and chemistry, gymnastics, and singing. In the girls’ school, there 
are fewer hours given to mathematics, the theoretical work in agri- 
culture is omitted, manual training is replaced by sewing, dress- 
making, and domestic economy, while hygiene, common law, and 
political economy are treated from a woman’s standpoint.!

Admission to the French secondary schools usually occurs 
at the age of ten. The boys’ school is seven years in length; 
the girls’ five. In the boys’ schools, the program of studies 
includes: Greek, Latin, modern foreign language, mathe- 
matics, history and geography, science, ethics, civil govern- 
ment and law, drawing, writing, and philosophy. In the 
girls’ schools, the program is entirely modern, no Latin or 
Greek being offered. One modern foreign language is, how- 
ever, prescribed for all, and a second modern language is 
optional during the last four years. Except for specialists, 
mathematics is limited to arithmetic and plane geometry. 
In the primary technical schools, the aim is to prepare pu- 
pils directly for vocations while at the same time giving 
a limited general education as a basis for citizenship and 
for understanding the problems of the trade. Training is 
adapted to local needs, the girls being educated primarily 
for the home or for flower making or dressmaking. 
But France, too, is contemplating a greater democratiza- 
tion of her schools. Speaking of the movement, Dr. Hosic 
says: 
Most ambitious is the program of Les Compagnons. This 
society, founded during the war by university men on leave from 
the trenches, is carrying on an active campaign for the complete 
reorganization of the French Université. First of all they wish to 
make it possible for all the children of all the people to pass on to 
the higher schools, no matter what school they have attended 
up to the age of twelve. This means the practical unification 
of the system. The distinction between primary and secondary 
education as the French use the term would disappear. In the 
second place, the society would decentralize and insure to each 
school unit and region more freedom to adapt instruction to the 
needs of the students and particularly to the facilities which a 
given region affords, as agriculture, mining, and manufacturing. 
In general, education would become less formal, bookish, and 
abstract, and more practical and vital.t

THE SIX-THREE-THREE PLAN 79 
(C) Germany 
(1) Folk or elementary school of eight years, designed 
for children of the laboring classes. 
(2) Intermediate school of nine years, designed for chil- 
dren of the intermediate classes. 
(3) Secondary school of six or nine years, designed for 
children of the superior social classes : 
(a) For boys. 
(6b) For girls. 
(4) Vocation schools. 
(5) Universities.! 
Here the types of schools that afford most suggestions for 
junior high school enthusiasts are the intermediate schools 
(Mittelschulen) and the secondary schools, particularly in 
the work of the first three, four, or five years. As in other 
parts of Europe, the three common types of schools — ele- 
mentary, intermediate, and secondary —run parallel to 
each other. A pupil rarely attends more than one type of 
school after he has reached the age of nine, the choice of 
types to be determined early in his childhood. 
The intermediate school in Germany corresponds to the 
higher primary school of France and England. It seeks to 
furnish a more intensive study than that afforded by the ele- 
mentary schools, particularly in respect to foreign language, 
history, and science, and aims to prepare boys and girls for 
the new demands of industry and commerce. The program 
of studies includes German, religion, history and geography, 
arithmetic and bookkeeping, nature study, writing, drawing, 
singing, physical training, and one foreign language. 
Secondary education is entered upon in Germany when 
the pupil is about nine years of age. Religion, ancient and 
modern language, history and geography, mathematics,

-P-A-G-E-90
  80 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
science, writing, drawing, singing, and gymnastics consti- 
tute the curriculum for all. Few classes meet daily, though 
some meet more than five times per week. 
For the girls, the Prussian secondary school, newly organ- 
ized in 1908, provides a ten-year course beginning at the age 
of six. Up to thirteen years of age, the course is uniform 
for all, but is designed to be “ethical and esthetic rather 
than intellectual.” Modern foreign language, but not an- 
cient language, is, however, included in the course from the 
beginning of the fourth year, when girls are about the age 
of nine.! . 
Speaking of the present trend in German education, the 
editor of School Life writes as follows: 
The national constitution of the 11th of August, 1919, contains 
under the fourth section, “Education and the School,” not less 
than nine comprehensive paragraphs in which appears thé establish- 
ment of a definite forward movement as compared to the conditions 
of 1914, since they remove all domination, including the despotism 
of the Standesschule (the denominational school), and the Lernschule 
(the bookish school of the traditional type). The unconditioned 
establishment of the Hinheitsschule (the unity school), the Weltlichen 
Schule (the secular-instruction school), and the Arbeitsschule (the 
motivated or creative school) does not necessarily follow, to be 
sure. In the main, the constitution makes promises only; but 
one can not easily disturb this foundation, even if the structure, 
proud and beautiful, does not arise immediately.” 
1The ordinary elementary school (Volksschule) of eight years likewise 
includes the period of our seventh and eighth grades. As such, it offers 
no particular suggestions for our junior high school. Supplementing the 
work of the elementary school, however, stands the continuation school 
(Fortbildungsschule), a part-time school, covering a period of two, three, or 
four years. The first year of this school would normally coincide with one 
of the years of our junior high school period. In so far as the junior high 
school has for its objectives trade education for youths approximately fifteen 
years of age, the German continuation school offers some help. Otherwise 
it contributes little to the problems of this school.

(1) Acommon elementary school of five or six years. 
(2) A group of intermediate schools consisting of : 
(a) A higher primary school of two or three years, 
designed for pupils not expecting to continue their 
education further. 
(6) A middle school of three or four years, designed 
for those pupils who expect to enter the second-

(6) Gymnasium, of three or more years, leading to 
the university. 
(4) Vocational schools. 
(5) University. 
While conspicuous differences exist in the organization of 
the schools in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, the points 
of likeness are sufficiently prominent to warrant grouping 
these countries together.

of the Scandinavian countries are found the usual formal 
branches of study, together with some or all of the following : 
religion ; geometry ; practical mathematics, including every- 
day arithmetic, applied geometry, and bookkeeping; sci- 
ence, including biology, physiology, physics, and chemistry ; 
two foreign languages (English and German) ; nature study ; 
hygiene and sanitation; history of modern times, particu- 
larly of the Scandinavian countries and their governments; 
geography, especially of the home country and including the 
topography, soil, climate, resources, and industries; writing, 
directed toward practical forms; drawing, directed toward 
practical ends; sloyd and manual training; swimming;

A careful analysis of the various foreign school systems 
mentioned reveals the following significant practices or tend- 
encies, namely : 
(1) 
(2) 
(3) 
(4) 
(5) 
(6) To terminate the common school at the end of six 
years. 
To provide some kind of transitional school for the 
three years, twelve to fifteen. 
To make the work of the transitional school realistic 
and vital to the pupils pursuing it. 
To have for the transitional school several coérdinate 
aims, namely : 
(a) To give to pupils cenoetunttss to test their apti- 
tudes and make self-discoveries. 
(b) To give to pupils overviews in many fields of 
knowledge. 
(c) To provide a practical moral and civic training 
for all pupils. 
(d) To lay prevocational foundations for those who 
expect to enter industry and trade, and to fur- 
nish them with a modicum of vocational train- 
ing. 
(e) To make an easier transition for pupils going 
into university preparatory schools. 
(f) a7 provide a more appropriate education for 
girls. 
To use a variety of names to designate the various 
types of transitional schools; namely, Higher Pri- 
mary School, Lower Secondary School, Introductory 
Secondary School, Intermediate School, Middle 
School, Lower Middle School, Modern School, Real 
School. 
To provide much flexibility in the administration of 
schools throughout the entire system. 
(7) To provide for pupils to begin secondary school sub- 
(8) 
(9) jects as early as eight, nine, or ten years of age. 
To provide special types of work for retarded pupils 
and those with short school careers before them. 
To provide for transferring pupils to advanced sec- 
ondary schools at the age of fifteen or sixteen.
-P-A-G-E-94

the same time decidedly enriches, the curriculum of 
the elementary school, and includes such subjects as:

try, bookkeeping, and accounting. 
Nature study and natural history. 
Introductory science with laboratory work, 
and courses in biology, physiology, physics, 
and chemistry. 
Geography, as it relates to the topography, 
soil, climate, resources, industries, and trade 
of people, particularly in the home land. 
Writing, directed to practical ends. 
Drawing, related to practical forms. 
Singing, centering about folk-songs and national 
anthems and designed to give a usable appre- 
ciation of music. 
Personal and public hygiene and sanitation. 
Gymnastics, related to practical ends and 
physical enjoyment. 
Practical arts appropriate to the locality and to 
the pupils undertaking them. 
Vocational arts suited to the needs of the time, 
the place, and the pupils. 
To organize the program of studies into a few cur- 
ricula, usually Literary, Commercial, Industrial, and 
Agricultural. 
) To segregate pupils on a basis of sex. 
To require from twenty-eight to thirty-two class 
periods per pupil per week. 
To ignore the uniform five-period scheiiuis of classes 
per week.
-P-A-G-E-95
THE SIX-THREE-THREE PLAN 85 
(15) To provide a sixty-minute class period, with much 
class study and little home study. 
(16) To provide a longer school day and school year than 
is customary in America. 
(17) To provide more men teachers for pupils of all stages 
of development than is generally the case in America. 
(18) To seek to give a rounded education to each pupil in 
whatever type or grade of school he may be found. 
In short, foreign countries proceed on the principle of hav- 
ing distinct types of schools for distinct types of pupils of the 
adolescent age. America has so far proceeded on the theory 
that it is wiser and more democratic to provide flexibility 
of administration within common types of schools than to 
risk the danger of fostering class distinctions by providing 
separate schools for separate classes. 
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSIDERATIONS 
Certain practical considerations lend their support to the 
reformed program, and likewise enter into the question of 
the reform of the schools on the six-three-three basis. Among 
the more common administrative considerations that give 
support to the junior high school plan of organization four 
may be stated. 
(1) Centralization and grouping of grades. The group- 
ing of the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades of a school sys- 
tem, or of a large geographical division of a school system, 
enables administrators to make use of certain desirable 
practices. In the separate ward or grammar schools, the 
pupil enrollment is not always sufficiently large to justify 
the employment of departmental organization; promotion 
by subject; an enriched program of studies; shop, labora- 
tory, and recreational activities; election of subjects; and 
supervised study. The junior high school provides for this 
particular contingency. Even in small systems, where the 
enrollment is light, the grouping of the three grades— seventh,
-P-A-G-E-96
  86 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
eighth, and ninth — is likely to result in a school sufficiently 
large to justify the practices mentioned. 
(2) Full-time teachers of special subjects. Instead of 
having a teacher of manual arts, domestic arts, music, fine 
arts, or other subjects traveling from school to school and 
spending but a part of a day in each, the junior high 
school plan places all of a teacher’s work in one building. 
This concentration renders it unnecessary for teachers to 
make trips from one center to another during the hours of the 
regular school day. 
(3) The employment of common shops, laboratories, gym- 
nasiums, and playgrounds by both senior and junior high 
schools. In small towns, building the junior high school in 
close proximity to the senior high school permits placing 
the shops, laboratories, gymnasium, swimming pool, audi- 
torium, school gardens, museums, conservatories, and other 
rooms and materials of special kinds between the two build- 
ings and thus makes them easily accessible to the pupils 
of both the junior and the senior high schools. Thus each 
group of students may have facilities and equipment which 
might easily be too expensive for either school to purchase 
at its own expense. Obviously, however, considerations of 
the above kind should govern only where the combined 
groups are relatively small. To attempt a scheme of this 
sort in larger cities and towns would defeat the very ends 
for which the segregated junior and senior high schools are 
maintained. 
(4) Relief from overcrowding. A junior high school, by 
taking the pupils of the ninth grade out of the senior school, 
often relieves congestion and obviates the building of a new 
and expensive four-year high school building. When this 
saving of expense can be effected without prejudice to the 
work of the school, it is certainly to be reeommended. The 
junior high school being simpler in all its ways than the 
 
-P-A-G-E-97
THE SIX-THREE-THREE PLAN 87 
senior high school, the expense for the building and equipment 
is usually less than the amount required for the great senior 
high schools of the present day. On the other hand, the right 
kind of junior high school building will cost more than a 
typical ward school. Neither is it good pedagogy to give 
to boys and girls, at a time when they are very sensitive to 
environment, buildings that are no longer serviceable for 
other groups of pupils. It will be true economy in the long 
run to abandon buildings that do not conform to sanitary, 
sesthetic, and economic standards rather than to patch, 
make over, or add to outgrown structures. 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
  CHAPTER SIX 
Wuat tHe New Scuoot SHoutp AccoMPLISH 
CHOOL organization and administration are but means 
to ends, never ends in themselves. Unless a reorgani- 
zation of the school system on the basis of the six-three-three 
plan can produce results superior to those of the tradi- 
tional school, there is no excuse or justification for urging 
a reform. It is therefore pertinent to ask: What does 
the junior high school seek to accomplish and what are its 
chances of success ? | 
What any school should accomplish will depend, of course, 
upon the philosophy of life held by the controllers of the 
system and the end they have in view. Now, life objec- 
tives or philosophies consist of ideals which have their origin 
in the concrete experiences of men and which are elabo- 
rated by the aspirations and the workings of the human spirit. 
The forms in which these ideals shape themselves are those 
copied from known patterns, modified by the operations of 
the constructive imagination. The kinds and influences of 
these life ideals have, doubtless, been almost infinite in num- 
ber, but a certain few have stamped themselves on the rec- 
ords of history in conspicuous ways. Among the more 
notable are these : 
(1) Happiness. Personal satisfaction secured through 
rational action. The Aristotelian doctrine of the “golden 
mean” best expresses it. 
(2) Pleasure. This is the ideal of personal gratification 
at all costs. Its modern motto might be, “‘Each for himself 
and the devil take the hindmost.”’ 
(3) Duty. This ideal has found followers in all ages. 
The Stoics pursued it to the point of death and pain. Their 
motto might be paraphrased, “Act justly, though the 
heavens fall,”’ or, “Be guided by principle in all matters.” 
88
-P-A-G-E-99
WHAT THE NEW SCHOOL SHOULD ACCOMPLISH 89 
(4) Discipline. This ideal is akin to that of the Stoics, 
but, to a greater degree than with the Stoics, its advocates 
justified their beliefs by the authority of divine law as in- 
terpreted by religion. 
(5) Culture. The philosophy which conceives culture 
to be the end and aim of life interprets it to mean the ac- 
quisition of a literary knowledge of a conventionalized type; 
the development of linguistic power; and a refinement of 
manner that conduces to gentleness, tolerance, and cour- 
tesy. 
(6) Self-realization. This expression is generally used 
to signify the development of individuality through the 
stimulation of inherited instincts and impulses, that is, free- 
dom to live one’s life unhampered by laws and social limi- 
tations. 
(7) Social welfare. In its extreme form, this idea regards 
the State as completely dominant over individuals. In the 
more commonly accepted form, however, the nation con- 
ceives the purpose of human existence to be human develop- 
ment and racial betterment, and holds that this end is best 
accomplished when each individual is developed in accord- 
ance with the potentialities of his own nature — provided only 
that these potentialities be not malignant and destructive of 
the fundamental principles of morality. 
Clearly, no single one of these life ideals can be regarded 
as the one accepted for the guidance of life in America today. 
The dominant philosophical ideal in America is probably a 
composite ideal made up of various factors. Democracy is 
the word that best sums up this ideal, and therefore democ- 
racy may be regarded as the goal of our civilization. Democ- 
racy implies a willing association of individuals in a social 
whole, and therefore holds both the ideal of self-realization 
and the ideal of social welfare. 
With this in mind, the Committee on the Reorganization 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
  90 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
of Secondary Education, in its formulation of the cardinal 
principles proposed for guidance in refashioning the schools, 
declares : 
Education in the United States should be guided by a clear con- 
ception of the meaning of democracy. It is the ideal of democracy 
that the individual and society may find fulfillment, each in the 
other. Democracy sanctions neither the exploitation of the in- 
dividual by society, nor the disregard of the interests of society by the 
individual. More explicitly, the purpose of democracy is so to 
organize society that each member may develop his personality 
primarily through the activities designed for the well-being of his 
fellow members and of society as awhole. ... Consequently, 
education in a democracy, both within and without the school, should 
develop in each individual the knowledge, interests, ideals, habits, 
and powers whereby he will find his place and use that place to shape 
both himself and society toward ever nobler ends. 
Continuing, the Committee on the Reorganization of Sec- 
ondary Education lays down seven “main objectives of edu- 
cation,”’ as follows: 
(1) Health. (2) Command of fundamental processes. (3) Worthy 
home-membership. (4) Vocation. (5) Citizenship. (6) Worthy 
use of leisure time. (7) Ethical character.? 
The Committee, after emphatically endorsing the six-three- 
three plan of school organization, then proceeds to sketch 
the nature of the work that should be demanded in the six 
upper grades in order that the given objectives mentioned 
may be realized : 
(1) Health. Health needs cannot be neglected during the period 
of secondary education without serious danger to the individual and 
the race. The secondary school should, therefore, provide health 
instruction, inculcate health habits, organize an effective program 
of physical activities, regard health needs in planning work and

-P-A-G-E-101
    WHAT THE NEW SCHOOL SHOULD ACCOMPLISH 91 
play, and codperate with home and community in safeguarding and 
promoting health interest. 
(2) Command of fundamental processes. Much of theenergy of the 
elementary school is properly devoted to teaching certain funda- 
mental processes, such as reading, writing, arithmetical compu- 
tations and the elements of oral and written expression. The facility 
that a child of twelve or fourteen may acquire in the use of these 
tools is not sufficient for the needs of modern life. Thisis particularly 
true of the mother tongue. Proficiency in many of these processes 
may be increased more effectively by their application to new material 
than by the formal reviews commonly employed in grades seven to 
eight. 
(3) Worthy home-membership. Worthy home-membership as an 
objective calls for the development of those qualities that make the 
individual a worthy member of a family, both contributing to and 
deriving benefit from that membership. 
This objective applies to both boys and girls. The social studies 
should deal with the home as a fundamental social institution and 
clarify its relation to the wider interests outside. Literature should 
interpret and idealize the human elements that go to make the home. 
Music and art should result in more beautiful homes and in greater 
joy therein. The coeducational school with a faculty of men and 
women should, in its organization and its activities, exemplify 
wholesome relations between boys and girls and men and women. 
(4) Vocation. Vocational education should equip the individual 
to secure a livelihood for himself and those dependent on him, to 
serve society well through his vocation, to maintain the right re- 
lationships toward his fellow workers and society, and, as far as 
possible, to find in that vocation his own best development. 
This ideal demands that the pupil explore his own capacities and 
aptitudes, and make a survey of the world’s work, to the end that he 
may select his vocation wisely. Hence, an effective program of 
vocational guidance in the secondary school is essential. 
Vocational education should aim to develop an appreciation of 
the significance of the vocation to the community, and a clear con- 
ception of right relations between the members of the chosen voca- 
tion, between different vocational groups, between employer and 
employee, and between producer and consumer. These aspects of 
vocational education, heretofore neglected, demand emphatic 
attention.

(5) Civic responsibility. Civic education should develop in the 
individual those qualities whereby he will act well his part as a 
member of neighborhood, town or city, State, and Nation, and give 
him a basis for understanding international problems. 
For such citizenship, the following are essential: a many-sided 
interest in the welfare of the communities to which one belongs; 
loyalty to ideals of civic righteousness; practical knowledge of social 
agencies and institutions; good judgment as to means and methods 
that will promote one social end without defeating others; and, as 
putting all these into effect, habits of cordial codperation in social 
undertakings. 
(6) Worthy use of leisure. Education should equip the individual 
to secure from his leisure the re-creation of body, mind, and spirit, 
and the enrichment and enlargement of his personality. 
This objective calls for the ability to utilize the common means of 
enjoyment, such as music, art, literature, drama, and social inter- 
course, together with the fostering in each individual of one or more 
special avocational interests. 
(7) Ethical character. In a democratic society, ethical character 
becomes paramount among the objectives of the school. Among 
the means for developing ethical character may be mentioned the 
wise selection of content and methods of instruction in all subjects 
of study, the social contacts of pupils with one another and with their 
teachers, the opportunities afforded by the organization and ad- 
ministration of the school for the development on the part of pupils 
of the sense of personal responsibility and initiative, and, above all, 
the spirit of service and the principles of true democracy which should 
permeate the entire school — principal, teachers, and pupils. 
The Committee likewise declared the immediate aims of 
the school to be: knowledge, powers, interests, ideals, and 
habits. 
These proximate aims of the school are, with slight modi- 
fications, illustrated by the table on pages 92 and 93.! 
Snedden states the objectives of the school — particularly 
of the school that takes charge of boys and girls in the early 
1 Course of Study and Manual of Instruction, Book Four, of Kalamazoo, 
Michigan, 1921.
-P-A-G-E-105
  WHAT THE NEW SCHOOL SHOULD ACCOMPLISH 95 
stages of adolescent development — to be, in his opinion, 
as follows: ! 
In the light of present experience, it seems highly desirable to 
classify the objectives of the education that is adapted to children 
of from twelve to fourteen years of age into at least two groups, 
according to the presence or absence in each study or phase of study 
of certain fundamental characteristics. A few concrete cases will 
make this clear. 
In teaching spelling (for example), the outcome expected on the 
part of the pupil is a certain quite definite and easily recognized 
ability to do, to execute, to express in action, and the learning process 
cannot be terminated economically until this end is achieved. On 
the other hand, the learning achieved in hearing a recital or witness- 
ing a dramatic performance (and we are agreed that some form of 
learning is thus achieved) can be subjected to no profitable test of 
expression, of doing. We expect absorption, assimilation, growth, 
as results, but the final outcome is so remote from the original 
stimulus that we do not, ordinarily, seek to trace connections. 
For the sake of convenient classification, let us call the first type 
of learning the alpha type, and the second the beta type. Let us 
repeat that the conspicuous result expected in the case of the alpha 
type is ability to do, to express in action, while the most tangible 
result expected in the case of the beta type is appreciation or, in one 
sense of the word, interest. 
In the seventh and eighth grades, it is probably in accordance with 
sound pedagogy so to teach arithmetic, penmanship, composition, 
spelling, and, presumably, grammar that these subjects should prop- 
erly fall in the alpha class. On the other hand, literature, science, and 
civics are, or doubtless ought to be, so taught as properly to belong 
to the beta class. 
History, geography, music, art, and practical arts seem to be 
composite. It is manifestly important, for example, that certain 
phases of history and geography should be so definitely taught that 
the resulting fixed knowledge becomes as available and inerrant as 
should be knowledge of the multiplication table. But it is intoler- 
able that all geography and history as organized for children from 
1Snedden, David, “‘Flexibility of Courses for Youths Twelve to Four- 
teen,” Educational Administration and Supervision, Vol. 2, pages 219 ée 
seq., April, 1916.
-P-A-G-E-106
96 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
twelve to fourteen years of age should be so taught. Most of the 
supplemental material used, and indeed much of the contents of the 
textbooks in current use, also, should be read, talked over, and the 
resulting impressions assimilated, but no fixed and instantly usable 
knowledge need be expected in these cases. Hence the proper 
organization of these subjects should involve a conscious and definite 
differentiation between alpha and beta portions of the teaching units 
or phases. 
Snedden also thinks music and art are composite and hence 
should be taught so as to yield both alpha and beta types of 
values. 
Briggs expresses the aim of the junior high school thus: 
Clearly an intermediate period of education, beginning one or 
two years before the law releases any pupil from study . . . [should] 
attempt at least five things : first, to continue, in so far as it may seem 
wise and possible, and in a gradually dimimishing degree, common 
integrating education; second, to ascertain and reasonably to 
satisfy pupils’ important immediate and assured future needs; 
third, to explore by means of material in itself worth-while, the 
interests, aptitudes, and capacities of pupils; fourth, to reveal to 
them, by material otherwise justifiable, the possibilities in the major 
fields of learning; and, fifth, to start each pupil on the career 
which, as a result of the exploratory courses, he, his parents, and the 
school are convinced is most likely to be of profit to him and to the 
State. 
Briggs further elaborates his ideas respecting these five- 
fold objectives as follows : 
It is probable that even in the best schools there will remain 
after the sixth grade many details which, because of the generous 
conception as to what all citizens should know or because of the 
immaturity of pupils, have not been taught. ‘These, when presented 
in the seventh, eighth, or even more advanced grades, continue the 
integrating effect of education and also result in the desirable 
gradual change toward complete differentiation. It is quite possible 
that the amount of this common integrating education should be 
determined by the holding power of the school.
-P-A-G-E-107
  WHAT THE NEW SCHOOL SHOULD ACCOMPLISH 97 
Continuing, he says, respecting the first specific objective : 
It must not be thought that this first purpose of the school is 
achieved only by the ordinary curricular matter, such as mathematics, 
civics, or English; toward it contributions are made also by extra- 
curricular activities, such as school assemblies, clubs, and pupil 
organizations for participation in the government of the school . . . 
and in addition by association in the school of children having different 
origins and aims, but making and sharing in a common atmosphere 
with its traditions of prejudices and ideals.? 
Surely few would deny that this first great aim is a valid 
one. Despite individual differences in interests, capacities, 
and powers, human nature is fundamentally uniform. There 
certainly can be no truly satisfactory democratic society un- 
less the various members composing it possess common ideals, 
common interests, common attitudes, common conventions, 
common stocks of knowledge, and common ways of procedure. 
As Bagley pointed out some years ago, it is doubtful if, with the 
great diversity of racial inheritances that enter into the com- 
plex of American society, six years of elementary training are 
sufficient for the purpose of integrating all forces into a 
body politic of the most desirable kind. A part of the 
effort and of the organization of the junior high school must 
assuredly be directed to a supplementation of the integrating 
processes begun in the lower grades. Perhaps, too, as Briggs 
says, the extent to which this earlier aim shall be continued 
shall be determined by “the holding powers of the school.” 
Surely, if education is the potent and beneficent force Ameri- 
can laymen and educators believe it to be, none can secure 
too great an amount, provided only it be of the right sort 
and adapted to individual needs. Therefore, as soon as it 
becomes evident that the common, formal instruction of an 
elementary type is no longer proving valuable to certain 
pupils and that their withdrawal from school is impending, 
1 The Junior High School, pages 162-163.
-P-A-G-E-108
98 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
the common integrating treatment should be differentiated. 
The change should not be made abruptly. Here, as else- 
where, a judicious mingling of the old and the new will prove 
wisest. Nevertheless, it is better to hold a pupil in school 
by means of a schedule of work that is wholly individualistic 
in character than not to retain him in school at all. The prob- 
lem, therefore, becomes one largely of personal adjustment. 
Briggs’s second objective, namely, “to ascertain and rea- 
sonably to satisfy pupils’ important immediate and assured 
future needs,” likewise is well established in reason and com- 
mon sense. Schools should not be guided in their practices 
solely by considerations of expediency. The commercial- 
ized vocational school of the day is likely to overstress the 
importance of immediate results; the school of past ages 
was accustomed to lay too great an emphasis upon future 
returns. The public school — particularly the junior high 
school — must judiciously combine the present and the future 
welfare of pupils in its plan. What is important for one 
pupil, however, may not be equally important for another. 
Moreover, the “assured future needs of pupils may be 
discovered only after a careful and continued study of 
local conditions, the intentions of pupils, and the histories of 
older people who have developed in similar surroundings.” ! 
Indeed, even this study will not enable one to form unequivo- 
cal deductions. The variable factors that operate in life 
are too numerous to warrant positive assertions respecting 
any problems in which they occur. The wise man analyzes 
the conditions as fully as circumstances will permit, arrives 
at a judgment, proceeds to act in the light of the facts, and 
then, as the philosopher Royce advised, “has no regrets.” 
Such must be the procedure of school authorities. None 
' may positively declare what is the one best plan of action for. 
any pupil. In action, by means of a thoroughly worked-out 
1 Op. ctt., page 164.
-P-A-G-E-109
WHAT THE NEW SCHOOL SHOULD ACCOMPLISH 99 
system of life and school guidance, sympathetically admin- 
istered by individuals who have had the advantage of ex- 
perience and special training, the best plan for each pupil will 
appear. Such a system of guidance should make use of 
standardized intelligence tests, physical and medical reports, 
school memoranda of former teachers, the advice of parents, 
social surveys, governmental and firm reports respecting 
various industries, trades, and professions, and the judgments 
of specialists in the several fields of activity. 
Among the means that should be used to give pupils 
clearer views of what the world has to offer are the courses 
of study, assembly or auditorium talks, home-room dis- 
cussions, books, magazines, motion pictures, stereopticon 
views, wall pictures, charts, maps, graphs, exhibits, junior 
chambers of commerce, school visits to places where various 
industries are in operation, school excursions to public in- 
stitutions, public works, and public monuments, and the 
constant correlation of school instruction with out-of-school 
practices. 
Of all the functions of the junior high school, that which 
seeks to aid pupils in discovering their own capacities and 
limitations, interests and distastes, powers and weaknesses, 
is, in the judgment of the writer, the most important.! It 
is this function, above all others, that justifies the reorgan- 
ization of schools on a new basis. Not that the traditional 
organization does not, to a certain degree, effect this purpose ; 
but, at best, its attainments are less than is desirable. To 
segregate adolescent pupils in a school by themselves; to 
surround them with influences that elicit their natural re- 
sponses; to afford them opportunities to browse in many 
fields of recorded endeavor; to permit them to try their 
strength in many different ways; to enable them to compete 
with other boys and girls of their own age; to permit them to 
1 This is Briggs’s third objective.
-P-A-G-E-110
    100 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
initiate, organize, and administer projects ; to employ methods 
of teaching that challenge their best efforts in thought and 
action; to stimulate and to develop their best instincts by 
encouraging self-expression, and by furnishing opportunities 
to see life as it is and to live it in school as ultimately it must 
be lived out of school — this is the work of the junior high 
school. To be sure, in making this exploration of pupils’ 
personality and individuality, the material used to accom- 
plish the end should have a positive value ; but if, as the Com- 
mittee on the Reorganization of Secondary Education de- 
clares, ““The purpose of democracy is so to organize society 
that each member may develop his personality primarily 
through activities designed for the well-being of his fellow 
members and of society as a whole,” ! then the exploratory 
material suitable for one pupil may be equally suitable for 
all — the single warning being that every pupil should be 
given access to the general try-out courses and activities 
offered to others. 
Obviously, this kind of professional care demands that a 
program of studies of wide range be offered in the school; 
that many introductory and try-out courses of short duration 
be provided ;? that the administration of the school be such 
that pupils not only shall have opportunity to test them- 
selves in many fields of work but shall be encouraged and 
required to do so; that many practical opportunities for 
doing, as well as learning, be furnished; and that use be 
made as fully as possible of supplementary, collateral, and 
quasi-educational agencies. 
The fifth objective enumerated by Briggs, namely, “to 
start each pupil on the career which, as a result of the explora- 
tory courses, he, his parents, and the school are convinced is 
1 “Cardinal Principles of Secondary Education,” Bulletin No. 35, page 9, 
1918. 
2 Briggs’s fourth objective.
-P-A-G-E-111
  WHAT THE NEW SCHOOL SHOULD ACCOMPLISH 101 
most likely to be of profit to him and to the State,” is essen- 
tially valid, provided the process is not begun at too early a 
date. The length of time needed to give an exploratory edu- 
cation no doubt varies with different individuals and with 
different school systems. It must not be forgotten, however, 
that the fundamental purpose of the junior high school is 
liberal culture on an elemental plane. The junior high school 
is to the individuals of the early adolescent stage of develop- 
ment what the college of literature, science, and the arts is 
to the prospective student of law or medicine. Both schools 
lay foundations of a general character and relate but inci- 
dentally to special vocations. 
Koos, in The Junior High School, shows what the functions 
of this type of school are thought to be by representative 
school administrators and educational leaders. His for- 
mulation supplements the deductions just given. He be- 
lieves in realizing a democratic school system by means of 
the following practices : 4 
(1) Retention of pupils; economizing the time of pupils; 
recognition of differences between pupils; the explora- 
tion of subject matter for the sake of guidance of 
pupils ; and vocational education. 
(2) Recognizing the nature of the child. 
(3) Providing conditions for better teaching. 
(4) Securing better scholarship. 
(5) Improving the disciplinary situation and socializing 
opportunities. 
(6) Effecting financial economy. 
(7) Relieving the building situation. 
(8 Continuing the influence of the home. 
(9) Hastening reforms in grades above and below. 
(10) Normalizing size of classes. 
(11) Relieving teachers. 
Inglis gives the main objectives of secondary education 
as (1) the social-civic; (2) the economic-vocational; and 
1 Op. cit., page 18.
-P-A-G-E-112
  102 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
(3) the individualistic-vocational. To realize these objectives, 
he states that the school should exercise the following six 
functions : ' 
The integrating function. The adjustive function. 
The differentiating function. The propedeutic function. 
The selective function. The diagnostic function. 
For Inglis, each of these functions should operate in the 
junior high school as well as in the senior high school. The 
integrating function should tend to foster social solidarity ; 
the differentiating function should aid in developing person- 
ality; the selective function should sift out the more fit 
from the less fit; the adjustive function should empower in- 
dividuals to relate themselves to the “‘everchanging demands 
of dynamic society”; the propzdeutic function should 
prepare the pupil to continue his studies into their more ad- 
vanced stages; and finally, the diagnostic function should 
help the pupil to discover his own elements of strength and 
weakness and to plan his life career accordingly. 
SUMMARY 
Thus, it may be said by way of summary that the junior 
high school should endeavor: 
(1) To check the withdrawal of pupils from the seventh, 
eighth, and ninth grades by providing school work that 
is both more interesting and educationally more valuable 
than that furnished by the traditional school; and by 
organizing and administering this work through methods 
that are more in keeping with the natures of adolescent 
pupils than are the methods commonly employed in the 
traditional elementary schools and senior high schools. 
(2) To encourage and assist pupils to discover their own 
permanent interests, their own reaches and limits of 
capacities, and their own best modes of self-expression,

> 
and then to assist them to choose life careers in which, 9 
(so far as enlightened human judgment is able to forecast) 
they can be most happy and contented and at the same 
time most socially effective and serviceable. 
(3) To remove, or at least to minimize, the personal and 
social dangers which inhere in the instincts, of adoles- 
cence, and to convert raw potentialities into habits 
that make for good citizenship, workmanship, sports- 
manship. 
(4) To shorten the period of training for some few individuals 
who have before them a long course of systematic school- 
ing, by permitting them to begin their differentiated edu- 
cation at an earlier age than has been customary in the 
past. 
(5) To provide a truly realistic education for all youths 
between the ages of twelve and sixteen, and, while adapt- 
ing this training to individual needs and interests, so 
to administer it that each shall ¢ome to possess at least 
an appreciative knowledge of all the major activities of 
humanity and shall develop a tolerance and a sympathy 
for individuals outside his own social group. 
(6) To interweave pre-vocational instruction and _ liberal 
culture so artfully that each shall have the effect of clari- 
fying, deepening, and making truly significant and effec- 
tive the elements of learning contributed by the other.

  CHAPTER SEVEN 
Tue PrRoGRAM OF STUDIES 
HE chief determinative factor of the character of a 
school is its program of studies. But in planning a 
program of studies certain preliminary considerations need 
to be taken into account and certain foundational principles 
need to be established. These have to do with the offer- 
ings; the time allotment of the various courses; the places 
assigned to the several courses in the schedules; the election 
of courses by pupils; the determination of curricula; and 
similar topics. 
THE CONTENT OF THE COURSE OF STUDY 
Superintendent E. H. Drake of Kalamazoo, Michigan, 
says : 
The question of what should enter into a course of study is ever a 
puzzling one to those who have to do with the planning or organiza- 
tion of such a thing. If we accept the now general view that the 
school is an institution which not only prepares for life but is life, 
we have very wide limits and the curriculum becomes very inclusive. 
But if we accept another theory that the curriculum is the embodi- 
ment of race experience to be made over in so far as possible into 
present-day life experience, perhaps the matter is simplified some- 
what. The subjects of study then become but phases of life about 
us—a thing that teachers and superintendents too often fail to take 
into consideration, and thus lay the foundation of many mistakes. 
These phases of life or subjects of study constitute largely the life 
of the school. ~The school is the institution which~takes the child” 
at an early age and for a number of years in connection with other 
institutions and influences, broadens his experiences, strengthens his 
powers, his capacities, and seeks to advance him toward the goal set 
up as the purpose of his education. In this process it should make | 
him better able to adjust himself to his environmént and make it 
minister to his physical, intellectual, moral, and zsthetic nature. 
One point, therefore, that should not be overlooked.is that the schools 
AS
-P-A-G-E-115
  THE PROGRAM OF STUDIES 105 
should be organized and conducted to give the child the greatest 
possible command over the things that are round about him. In 
this connection it should be said that it is but fair that he ask to be 
given some insight into vocations, some guidance and some training 
toward a vocation.! 
James M. Glass, in formulating a plan for the guidance of 
school officers in Pennsylvania (1922), presents his views as 
follows : 
The junior high school program of studies should be a resultant 
of several forces. It should be made up, in part, of a continuation 
of the elementary school curriculum, but a review of these courses, 
j.e., a new view through articulation of elementary and secondary 
courses; in part, a preview of secondary school courses of study, but 
a rearrangement of such courses in their “simpler aspects, deferring 
the refinements” to later senior high school grades; in part, a pre- 
vocational content from the industrial and commercial fields; and, 
finally, a liberal amount of social science materials and social and 
civic activities to the end of giving to the early adolescent a “‘self- 
conscious social adjustment.” This transitional unit of the public 
school system must preserve its contacts and become a composite 
product of the forces which precede and follow it. 
It is, therefore, the difficult mission of the junior high school to 
continue a program of studies carried through the six years of the 
elementary school, modify and enlarge this program for the realiza- 
tion of its own purposes, and in turn prepare for advanced types of 
curricula in the senior high school. It is plain that this can be done 
only through successive periods in the transitional process. Briefly, 
these periods are four in number. 
A. Adjustment. Low Seventh. 
A period of adjustment for the very young and immature adoles- 
cent of twelve years of age. He must be adjusted to a new 
school organization, and to a new type of school administration. 
It would seem wise, therefore, to subject him during the first 
semester to as little change as possible in his program of studies. 
Such change as is advisable should be restricted to the inevitable 
modifications in the courses of study which are consequent to 
1 Course of Study and Manual of Instruction for the Public Schools of 
Kalamazoo, Michigan, Book 4, 1921.
-P-A-G-E-116
  106 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
enlarged school facilities and departmentalization. There should 
be no change in the program of studies occasioned by the in- 
troduction of electives. In fact, the tabulated report of the 
questionnaire shows over a 50 per cent vote in favor of postpon- 
ing electives to the eighth year. Present practice gives little sup- 
port to any seventh year elective. 
. Exploration and Preview (apperceptive basis of secondary 
courses). High Seventh and Low Eighth. 
There should be a period of exploration, when there is a preview 
of the specialized secondary school courses which distinguish 
one high school curriculum from another, and when prevoca- 
tiona] try-out is provided for drop-outs. This first general 
view of secondary school subject matter is restricted to the 
“‘simpler aspects” of the whole subject field prior to any at- 
tempt to cross-section it into its parts. This general introduc- 
tory course offers opportunity for exploration of aptitude for the 
whole subject field and for a preview of apperceptive basis for 
the cross-sections of the subject. Properly, therefore, junior 
high school courses are designated as general mathematics, 
general science, world history and general social science, pre- 
vocational courses, junior business training, etc. 
Provisional Choice of Electives. High Eighth. 
Following the period of exploration and preview there should be 
a period of provisional choice of electives. During this period 
facility of cross-over between electives should be promoted by 
every administrative device possible, to the end of guaranteeing 
that evidence of unfitness for an elective will be followed by 
effecting a change of electives. In case this period of provisional 
choice does not extend beyond one semester, there would be 
justification for postponing promotion requirements in electives 
during this semester. 
D. Stimulation. Ninth Year. 
Finally, in the accomplishment of the purpose of the junior high 
school to serve as a transitional stage in the public school system, 
there must be a period of stimulation to facilitate transition to 
the senior high school. The ninth year of the junior high school 
is primarily for the purpose of making desirable in the estima-

THE PROGRAM OF STUDIES 107 
tion of each pupil advancement into the next higher type of 
school. The ninth year carries on the program selected after 
the experiment of the two previous grades. This stimulation is 
largely by the agency of the particular electives chosen during 
the periods of exploration and provisional choice.1 
The following statement appeared in an article by W. C. 
Bagley and C. H. Judd: 
The first principle, then, which we reach in our consideration is 
the principle that all organization within the schools should be 
judged as appropriate to the American system of education just in 
the degree in which it makes for continuous and uninterrupted 
opportunity for every pupil. 
The second general principle is closely related to the first. Within 
each school unit there has been and is appearing in still larger 
measure an enrichment of the course of study and of the opportunity 
offered to the pupil. 
The enriched program must have one characteristic above all 
others. It must be appropriate to a democracy. Here we come to 
a point in the discussion where it is easy to fall into disagreements. 
The world is still experimenting with democracy. We are striving 
to develop a democracy in our other social institutions, as, for 
example, in our industries. How difficult it is to reach a generally 
acceptable definition of democracy appears if we study industries 
and industrial legislation and note the many shades of divergent 
opinion and conflicting practices. 
Out of the uncertainties which surround this part of our discus- 
sion we may expect fairly universal assent to three general state- 
ments. First, the future must see greater emphasis than has the 
past on studies of community life and community needs. And the 
term “‘community”’ must not be narrowly defined. The course of 
study must be enriched to include intensive study of our nation and 
its meaning to our citizenship and to the world. Secondly, the 
future must see the enriched course providing a broad, sure founda- 
tion for the practical life of the individual. Again, there must be 
no narrow limitation of the individual, no training for a single type 
of life. This is not a plea for narrow trade training; it is rather an 
assertion that there must be a vigorous effort toward the develop- 
ment of a comprehensive view of industry, so that the individual

-P-A-G-E-118
108 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
may choose his career after a broad view of democratic opportunity. 
Thirdly, the enrichment of the course must aim consciously at the 
destruction of those provincialisms and class prejudices which have 
worked in the history of nations in the past, counter to the interests 
of democracy. Ignorance of other tasks than one’s own breeds 
lack of sympathy and results in the separation of group from 
group. Intelligence regarding others brings with it sympathy and 
codperation. 
Each of the three points outlined in the last paragraph invites 
one to compose a chapter on educational possibilities. This is not 
the appropriate place for a full discussion of these matters. In 
order to avoid ambiguity two negative statements must be made. 
First, a course of study is not broad or enriched in the sense in 
which the term “enrichment” is used in this article if it is a limited 
course preparing for a trade. Nor is the fact lost to view that there 
is a legitimate demand in the experiences of many boys and girls 
for a trade training. It is, however, contended, with unlimited 
emphasis on the needs of a democracy, that whenever trade training 
is given it should be accompanied just as far as possible by broaden- 
ing, sympathy-cultivating instruction. To give early a limited 
occupational training will tend (1) to set up class distinctions, and 
(2) to deprive large numbers of children of the broad basis of general 
and liberal training, which is essential to successful democracy. 
Every effort to reorganize the work of the upper grades should start 
from the fundamental principle that effective democracy implies the 
highest possible level of trained and informed intelligence in all of 
the members of the democratic group. 
Secondly, there are certain forms of enlargement of the course 
of study which defeat rather than promote the ends of education. 
Thus if more subjects are introduced into the course than can be 
assimilated by the pupils, there will follow a distraction which will be 
quite as disastrous as any limitation that could be put on the course. 
Pupils will fail to learn the lesson of concentration of attention; 
thoroughness and mastery will have no meaning for them; they will 
carry away a confused general idea of the materials they study, and 
they will fall into a type of superficial thinking which is one of the 
perils of the modern course of study. 
Not only so, but there is danger in the enlargement of the course 
of study that subjects will be introduced which are in form far be- 
yond the maturity of the pupils. The old-fashioned course of study
-P-A-G-E-119
  THE PROGRAM OF STUDIES 109 
undoubtedly made the mistake of assuming too little capacity on the 
part of the pupils. The new and more ambitious programs are some- 
times reckless in the introduction of advanced courses. If, for 
example, algebra and geometry are to be brought down into the 
elementary grades, they must be modified in their content and in 
their mode of presentation as compared with the same subjects when 
taught in the high school. ‘There is no surer way to fail in the seventh 
and eighth grades than to carry back without change a high-school 
course in algebra and attempt to administer it in a formal way to 
immature pupils. ‘These examples should serve as warnings against 
an irrational and ill-considered enlargement of the course of study. 
Here is expert opinion that is difficult to oppose. “Con- 
tinuous and uninterrupted opportunity for every pupil” 
and “an enrichment of the course of study ’’ — these, surely, 
are matters to which all enthusiasts of the reform program 
can subscribe. 
It has long been evident that if the junior high school is 
to justify the expectations of educational reformers and 
serve the ends established for it, the program of studies must 
not be narrow and formal. Neither may the school justify 
itself with an array of subjects differing slightly from those 
found in the traditional elementary school. A veritable 
wealth of offerings of varied types must be furnished. In- 
deed, to the degree that an enriched and suitable program 
of studies is provided, to that degree will the school approx- 
imate the true ideal of a junior high school. 
Nevertheless, no single program of studies can be formu- 
latedthat-will meet_all conditions. Programs of studies 
£ must always grow out of local as well as national and univer- 
/ sal needs. It is as absurd to draft a program of studies 
for schools in general as it is to prescribe a given medicine for 
diseases in general. Each school district has special prob- 
lems, interests, and limitations which must be taken into 
account.

  110 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
Hence it follows that the first step in drafting a program of 
studies for a given community is to conduct a thorough com- 
munity survey. Such a survey should reveal the number of 
the inhabitants, the economic resources, and the cultural 
interests of the community; the school census, school en- 
rollment, and school attendance; the existing program of 
studies, the percentages of school losses, school retarda- 
tions, school accelerations, and school graduates. It should 
likewise afford information concerning the customary post- 
school occupations of the young people, the articulate re- 
quests for school changes, the status of the school as judged 
by standardizing agencies, and other data. From these 
facts should be determined in as scientific a manner as pos- 
sible what goals the pupils are likely to set for themselves 
after leaving school; what subjects of study will contribute 
to their practical and cultural interests; how these studies 
should be organized and presented in order to yield the best 
results; and the ability of the community to finance the pro- 
gram thus suggested. Not that only such subjects as local 
considerations suggest should be included in a program. 
Quite the contrary. Besides local and personal interests, ° 
there are national and general interests which should be 
considered. 
Hence the program of studies ought to be built on a quad- 
rilateral foundation : 
(1) The individual interests of the pupils. 
(2) The community needs and resources. 
(3) The national purposes and objectives. 
(4) The welfare of society in general. 
ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAM 
Another problem relating to the program of studies is 
that concerning the intensity and continuity of the subjects
-P-A-G-E-121
THE PROGRAM OF STUDIES 111 
that are admitted to the program. Shall, for example, Latin, 
if provided at all, be offered for a single year, or for two or 
three years? Shall it be so organized as to require a meeting 
of teacher and pupils every day, or at less frequent intervals ? 
These questions attach themselves inseparably to others: 
thus, for example, the length of the class period, the mode of 
utilizing the class period, and the number of days in the school 
year. For obviously it is conceivable, at least, that three 
class periods of sixty minutes each per week extending over 
two hundred days may yield vastly more effective results 
than five class periods of forty minutes each extending over 
a period of only one hundred and eighty days. 
The socialized recitation is, in the light of the best evi- 
dence at hand, the most desirable type of recitation period 
for the junior high school. The socialized recitation rests 
on the belief that the class hour should be utilized, not pri- 
marily for the sake of testing pupils and thereby making 
the work depend upon memory alone, but for the purpose of 
developing thought, clarifying concepts, deepening inter- 
ests, giving practice in expression, and making permanent 
and usable the impressions that have been formed. In other 
words, instead of seeking almost exclusively to discover what 
pupils know or do not know about a lesson, a teacher, during 
the class period, should interpret facts, clarify ideas, illus- 
trate principles, refine sentiments, and train pupils to apply 
knowledge to the solution of real problems and to the enrich- 
ment of personal experiences. Work of this kind is accom- 
plished, not through the inactivity of pupils, but by means 
of their participation. Thus it appears that the socialized 
recitation is little or nothing more than a study period in 
which, under the guidance of the teacher, topics are de- 
veloped largely through the give and take of ideas contrib- 
uted by the pupils themselves. 
The conversational, developmental type of class exercise
-P-A-G-E-122
    112 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
is, as stated before, suitable for adolescent boys and girls, 
provided only that the teacher have the proper qualities of 
leadership. When this method is followed, classroom reci- 
tation hours tend to lose for pupils their formal aspects. 
The physical and mental strain frequently caused by the in- 
flexibility of the method used in traditional recitation pe- 
riods is diminished. School becomes play rather than work, 
for the end seems to the pupil to be in the activity itself 
rather than in a remote objective. The fatigue point is not 
so quickly reached and the class exercise can readily be ex- 
tended to fifty or fifty-five minutes without endangering the 
health of the pupils or losing their interest. Moreover, 
with the class period constituting the chief working period 
for pupils, little home study is required or desired. Thus a 
longer school day is justified. 
All things considered, there seems to be warrant for advo- 
cating for typical school communities a program of studies 
of ample scope, with courses distributed over the three years 
of the junior high school period in accordance with the needs 
and resources of the community; with class periods of ap- 
proximately one hour in length; with the number of weekly 
class meetings varying with the importance of the subject 
and the rules of pedagogy; with full use of the socialized 
recitation as an agency for teaching; with a longer school 
day ; and with small demand on the pupils for home study. 
CURRICULA 
In addition to the problem of scope or range of subject 
matter, of the continuity with which the courses are organ- 
ized within the several fields of interest, and of the number 
of weekly recitation periods, three other fundamental prob- 
lems exist in respect to the teaching materials that consti- 
tute the program of studies. These are: 
(1) The number and types of curricula to be provided, or
-P-A-G-E-123
  
THE PROGRAM OF STUDIES 113 
  the modes of arranging courses so that they shall tend to 
prepare pupils for fairly definite goals or careers in more ad- 
vanced schools or in life. 
(2) The determination of the constant and the variable 
factors that enter into the several curricula. 
(3) The flexibility of administration of courses and cur- 
ricula whereby immature choices may later be revised without 
injustice, if circumstances make revision desirable. 
Reference has already been made to the number and kinds 
of physical, intellectual, emotional, and practical differences 
that exist among individuals. One of the chief functions 
— if not the chiefest function — of the junior high school is 
to discover these differences and to administer the school 
work so as to develop personality to its highest practical de- 
gree in each individual. Such a conclusion obviously de- 
mands that more than a single curriculum shall be provided 
in the schools. How many and what curricula shall be of- 
fered is a debatable question. Judging from the experiences 
of many administrators, four or five curricula are ample. 
More than this number tend to confuse the pupil; fewer than 
this number take individual differences too little into ac- 
count. The curricula that should without fail be provided 
are: (1) the college preparatory; (2) general; (3) com- 
mercial; (4) industrial; and (5) household arts. In addi- 
tion, it may prove desirable for certain cities, or for particu- 
lar schools in certain cities, to provide one or more specific 
trade curricula for pupils who will never enter the senior 
high school but who will soon enter — possibly before com- 
pleting the junior high school course—upon the business of 
wage-earning. 
Moreover, the number and kind of curricula will not in- 
frequently vary in the different schools of the same city. 
Whenever schools are located in sections of the city charac- 
terized by interests separate and distinct from those of other
-P-A-G-E-124
  114 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
sections of the city, differentiating curricula should be provided. 
It is, for example, conceivable that in one district the inter- 
est of the inhabitants is primarily literary and cultural; in 
a second section, commercial; in a third section, industrial ; 
and, in other districts, specifically vocational. Within each 
of these districts, therefore, the curricula should conform 
closely to the paramount needs. 
J. H. Newlon, former Superintendent of Schools in Lincoln, 
Nebraska, using that city as an example, expresses the idea 
thus: 
I doubt very much whether it will be possible to maintain the 
same kind of junior high school, as regards curricula, in all parts of 
our cities. I can illustrate by the city of Lincoln, Nebraska. In 
Lincoln, at the present time, there are three junior high and pre- 
vocational school centers. Of these three, the Hayward school 
center is located in the German and Russian district, the Bancroft 
center is located in an industrial part of the city, while the McKinley 
center is located in the old high school building in the central part 
of the city, and is easily accessible to the entire population. It is 
perfectly natural and proper, therefore, that industrial and com- 
mercial curriculums should be emphasized in the Hayward and 
Bancroft schools while, in the McKinley School, these curricula 
should be paralleled by a liberal arts curriculum for an accelerated 
group of students who are destined for the college preparatory 
courses in the high school and after high school for the colleges, 
and eventually for leadership in the business, professional and 
social life of the community. 
Often .a specialized junior high school meeting the needs of a 
particular community will popularize itself in that community and 
justify the junior high school idea in the eyes of the entire city. 
Statistics show that the Hayward and Bancroft schools in Lincoln, 
with their commercial and practical arts curriculums, are holding 
more students in the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades, and are 
sending more students to high school than formerly. The way 
must be kept open, of course, in all schools for entrance to the senior 
high school, but a wise superintendent and board will adapt the 
junior high school, as far as possible, to local conditions.!

-P-A-G-E-125
  THE PROGRAM OF STUDIES 115 
An important decision relates to the constant and variable 
elements in the several curricula. Surely, if the junior high 
school is to continue the integrating influences of education 
started in the elementary school, a considerable portion of 
the curricular offerings will be uniform prescriptions for all 
normal children, irrespective of the future. On the other 
hand, the interests of individuality require that not all work 
shall be common. What subjects, therefore, to prescribe 
for all; what to permit as alternative selections; and what 
to leave to election, are unsettled questions. Seemingly, 
little or no differentiation should be permitted in the seventh 
grade; some should be allowed in the eighth grade; and con- 
siderable should be permitted in the ninth grade. 
For pupils greatly retarded in the school work and for 
those for whom the more formal studies in the school have 
little interest, individual curricula should be arranged. Cer- 
tainly, the junior high school is no place for a Procrustean 
administration of work — particularly when it affects the 
ungradable pupil. 
Finally, the administration of the several curricula must 
not be so conducted as to prevent absolutely all revision of 
curricular choices when once made; nor allowed to operate 
in such a way as to penalize an individual unnecessarily 
when permission to make changes is granted. The junior 
high school being, primarily, a testing place, opportunity 
must be allowed for explorations. Such explorations must 
include prevocational and, sometimes, vocational work, as 
well as the more general literary, scientific, and artistic 
studies. Whenever a pupil, notwithstanding an honest effort 
carried on for a reasonable period of time, has shown his 
utter incapacity or distaste for a self-selected subject of 
study, he should be permitted to discontinue his study of 
that subject and allowed to begin again in a new field. Nor 
is “‘a reasonable period of time”’ to be taken to mean the
-P-A-G-E-126
116 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
completion of a fixed amount of work. Six weeks may be 
ample time in which to test a pupil’s powers; indeed, in some 
cases a shorter period may suffice. 
When transferences from one curriculum to another, or 
from one course to another, are allowed, due credit for work 
successfully pursued under the one schedule should be ac- 
corded in the new one. There surely is little justification 
for requiring two years’ work in any given subject before 
it shall be treated as worthy of recorded credit. A single 
semester in a foreign language or mathematics or any other 
subject should yield educational value. Therefore, while 
transference from one curriculum to another ought not to 
be permitted for trivial reasons, it ought not to be forbidden 
entirely. When such change of course is allowed, the school 
credits that have been earned should be accepted at face 
value, provided they are such as contribute to the ends sought 
in the second curriculum. 
In planning curricula, it seems reasonable to assume that 
introductory, general courses shall precede courses of a more 
specialized character. And yet, until the junior high school 
idea was advanced, few schools organized their work on that 
basis. Relatively few do so even today either in the junior 
high school or in the traditional four-year high school. The 
reform plan suggests that a course dealing with the elements 
of science in general be given before any special courses in 
physics, chemistry, or biology are taken up; likewise that a 
general survey of elementary algebra and simple geometry 
be had before ‘ac a courses are pursued; and that a 
course concerning itself with various aspects of manual arts 
be taken before work in forging, printing, or carpentry is 
pursued intensively. The principle is valid in respect to all, 
or nearly all, branches of learning provided for in the school.!   
1Many colleges and universities are following this plan today. For 
example, introductory courses or general courses touching the larger aspects 
of the entire field of thought are commonly, found in economics, sociology, 
 
-P-A-G-E-127
  THE PROGRAM OF STUDIES EV? 
From the foregoing considerations it is obvious that before 
any program of studies can be intelligently formulated for 
the junior high school the following questions must be asked : 
~ (1) What subjects, if any, which are at present found in 
the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades should be uprooted en- 
tirely and abandoned ? 
(2) What subjects, if any, which are at present found in 
the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades should be transplanted 
to other divisions of the school system ? 
(3) What subjects, if any, which are at present found 
in the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades should be retained ? 
(4) What subjects, if any, which are at present generally 
found in grades other than the seventh, eighth, and ninth 
should be transposed and included in the junior high school 
grades ? 
(5) What new material which at present is found, if at 
all, only rarely in any school curriculum should be generally 
introduced into the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades? 
Possibly no subject that has traditionally found a place in 
the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades is so worthless as to 
warrant its being condemned and eliminated entirely from 
all school programs, but in particular school systems certain 
subjects may deserve that fate. 
That certain subjects found in the seventh, eighth, and 
ninth grades may very wisely be transplanted to other di- 
visions of the system seems to be the opinion of many stu- 
dents ef.education. Specifically speaking, it is very ques- 
tionable whether English grammar treated as a separate 
course in the eighth grade, ancient history in the ninth grade, 
and physical geography as a specialized subject in the ninth 
grade, should not be transferred to the upper grades of the 
philosophy, psychology, literature, history, science, and most other subjects. 
The idea, too, rests on sound principles of psychology. It is hardly con- 
ceivable that the same principles do not apply equally well in the junior 
high school. 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
118 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
secondary school. Certainly, this seems to be a wise pro- 
cedure, unless, being retained where they are, they are given 
a thorough overhauling and reorganization. English gram- 
mar is one of the most abstract subjects in the curriculum. 
It is an appropriate study for advanced students who have 
specialized in language; it is not appropriate for beginners. 
Not, of course, that grammatical forms shall not be taught 
in the junior high school; but such grammar as is taught 
should be very elementary. Students of language are con- 
vinced that, unless grammar is very carefully taught, it 
aids little in developing habits of correct speech. So much, 
and only so much grammar should be given boys and girls of 
junior high school age as they can apply in their daily com- 
mon use of English. The place for a comprehensive study of 
grammar is elsewhere. 
Likewise, it certainly is probable that ancient history, 
as generally taught, may best be deferred to the senior high 
school. ‘Theevents described are so remote; the treatment of 
the topics is so discouragingly detailed; the stress is so often 
upon political, constitutional, and military topics; and the 
articulation of the course, taken as a unit, is frequently 
so loosely made with present-day interests of boys and girls, 
that the subject makes little or no appeal to large numbers 
of pupils. Moreover, the ninth grade is a grade so critical 
in school life that the work offered in it should be preémi- 
nently appealing to pupils’ interests and should operate to 
develop in them a genuine love of historical reading and study. 
Ancient history rarely has this effect. 
The fault with physical geography as a ninth grade study 
is not, probably, due so much to its content as to its 
organization and treatment. Geography is essentially an 
outdoors study. That is, its value and interest depend to a 
large degree upon the concreteness of the material used. 
Textbooks, charts, and even laboratories do not furnish this
-P-A-G-E-129
  THE PROGRAM OF STUDIES 119 
element. The open fields, the running streams, the earth 
formations of many kinds, alone can give the concepts that 
are real and permanent. Nor are these likely to be devel- 
oped unless an approach has already been made to the spe- 
cial field by means of earlier general and introductory courses 
in science. 
Continued experimentation may show us that other sub- 
jects traditionally found in the seventh, eighth, and ninth 
grades ought to be removed from those grades. If this 
prove to be the fact, let none hesitate to apply the remedy. 
Programs of study should not be rigid formulations. They 
are means to ends. When the means do not contribute to 
the ends established, they should be abandoned and others 
substituted for them. 
Investigations and reports made in recent years tend to 
prove conclusively that many of the subjects traditionally 
found in the seventh and eighth grades can be rigorously 
pruned of much dead and useless material. The Fourteenth 
and Sixteenth Yearbooks of the National Society for the 
Study of Education treat this problem in detail. It is need- 
less to repeat the findings and recommendations of this So- 
ciety here. It is sufficient to state that, in the judgment of 
the Committees, each of the common school subjects can be 
reduced in content and can be organized in a manner that 
will permit the saving of much time in school work. 
A practical consideration of pupils’ needs suggests that the 
following subjects be transferred from the senior high school 
to the junior high school. 
(1) Foreign language, including Latin, German French, 
and Spanish. 
(2) Elementary algebra and geometry. 
(3) Civies. 
(4) Commercial branches of various kinds. 
1 Published by Public School Publishing Company, Bloomington, Illinois.
-P-A-G-E-130
  120 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
(5) Mechanical drawing and design. 
(6) Fine arts. 
(7) Prevocational or general industrial courses of several 
kinds. 
(8) Agricultural, horticultural, and floricultural courses. 
It is a well-accepted pedagogical principle that the time to 
begin a foreign language is in the earlier years of life, before 
marked self-consciousness has become an inhibitory factor 
in expression and before sensitiveness to the misuses of the 
conventional forms of speech is acute. Moreover, in order 
that foreign language study shall yield the maximum of 
value, it needs to be pursued, at least by those who have a 
long literary career before them, for a maximum period of 
years. Beginning the study in the seventh or eighth grade 
permits both of these conditions to be met. 
Similarly, mathematicians have advocated for years that 
the more elementary and fundamental portions of algebra 
and geometry can most advantageously be pursued by pupils 
in the earlier years of school life and before the more difficult 
portions of arithmetic are undertaken. Teachers and ad- 
ministrators have many times discovered the fact that pupils 
inapt and dull in dealing with relatively complicated arith- 
metical processes and problems have entered with eagerness 
upon the study of algebra and geometry and have shown 
unexpected ability in pursuing these subjects. Furthermore, 
scientific experiments in education seem to justify the plan 
of presenting a course in unified mathematics to pupils in 
the early stages of the secondary schools, rather than a dis- 
severed array of courses, each one dealing with a single 
phase of mathematical material. 
If ever a course in civics can find justification in the school 
program, it ought to find that justification before the ranks 
of pupils have been decimated by eliminations. Granted 
that much of the civil government heretofore taught in the
-P-A-G-E-131
  
  THE PROGRAM OF STUDIES 121 
senior year of the high school has been ineffectual in develop- 
ing real qualities of citizenship, there is no excuse for per- 
mitting it to remain in that state. Neither can there 
be any defense for neglecting to provide an introductory 
course, appropriate in content, to be taken before the 
time when the compulsory education laws release their hold 
upon pupils. 
Fine arts, drawing, and the various general introductory 
courses in industry, commerce, and other occupations need 
little argument to justify their claims to recognition in a 
school, the chief ideal of which is to enable pupils to explore 
the realm of human activities and interests. 
In seeking to apportion to the junior high school subjects 
heretofore allotted to the upper grades of the four-year high 
school, considerable caution is needed. As Inglis states it: 
One of the gravest dangers to be faced in the reorganization of the 
program of studies is that “high school” subjects be “‘ pushed down” 
into the lower grades. Nowhere is the “‘word-jingle” fallacy more 
common than in the matter of subjects of study. One of the most 
important considerations involved in the reorganization of education 
is found in the reclassification of material in the various fields of 
knowledge and training that go under the general and loose terms 
“English,” “history,” “science,” etc. It is high time that we 
realized that specific content and teaching method determine to a 
considerable degree the subject. ‘The worst error we can make is to 
*‘push down”’ into the seventh and eighth grades “high school”’ 
subjects.) 
In the following chapters, the aims, range of content, modes 
of organization, and methods of administration of the sub- 
ject matter to be found in the several major fields of junior 
high school study are discussed. The treatment is neither 
exhaustive nor thoroughly scientific, but it may offer sug- 
gestions that will be of assistance to administrators.

  122 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
In outlining courses for the junior high school, the funda- 
mental principle of the whole reform movement must not 
be lost to view. This is, to take account of individual dif- 
ferences among pupils and to afford each pupil a preliminary 
survey of every field of knowledge he is expected to enter, 
by making all first courses exploratory courses. The pro- 
spectus recently issued by the Pennsylvania State Depart- 
ment of Public Instruction deals with this question in the 
following manner : 
Every exploratory course must fulfill a twofold purpose: first, to 
help some pupils to explore their aptitude for the course, and second, 
to give all pupils an actual educational return. There is a similar 
dual nature in all the objectives of the junior high school by reason 
of the fact that there are two practically exclusive groups of pupils — 
first, those who will continue into senior high school and, secondly, 
those who will drop out during or at the end of the junior high school 
period. For the former each exploratory course becomes the basis 
of choice of electives, and for the latter each exploratory course 
must contain a content of genuine educational value. For the drop- 
outs, therefore, every general course must preserve life contacts. 
Each course must become a unit course of definite educational value 
in each year of its development. As the Commission on the Re- 
organization of Secondary Education states it, — “Each subject 
should be so organized that the first year of work will be of definite 
value to those who go no further; and this principle should be 
applied to the work of each year.” ... Each junior high school 
general course of study, therefore, should establish itself as an 
identity, a self-contained unit, with definite continuity below and 
above and with a definite educational value independent of any 
course above. 
That the majority of administrators who have had ex- 
perience in planning general introductory courses in the 
junior high schools are favorably disposed towards such 
courses is evidenced by the replies recently returned to a 
questionnaire sent out by a Commission appointed by the 
National Council of Education. The Commission asked:

  THE PROGRAM OF STUDIES 123 
(A) Should you consider a background of experience with high 
school subjects in their simpler aspects (general mathe- 
matics, general science, prevocational courses, junior business 
training, etc.) desirable for junior high school pupils before 
the initial choice of elective is permitted ? 
(B) Following a period of exploration and preview of high school 
and equivalent subject matter, should you favor a brief 
period of testing the initial choice of electives, i.e., should 
there be provisional choice of electives? 
Sixty-four replies to these questions were received, the 
individual judgments being recorded thus: ! 
Yes No Unanswered 
Question A 84.5% 14.0% 1.5% 
Question B 73.5% 14.0% 12.5% 
Among analysts of the curriculum, none, perhaps, ranks 
higher in America than Professor Franklin Bobbitt, of the 
University of Chicago. In his treatise, The Curriculum, 
Bobbitt declares : 
There are two levels of educational experience, both of which 
are essential to the fullness of growth, efficiency of action, and 
completeness of character. Both are good, both are necessary; one 
precedes the other. One is experienced on the play-level; the other 
is experienced on the work-level. ... Impelled only by curiosity and 
the play motive, following the leadings of interest, children and youth 
should, it appears, wander through every important field of human 
knowledge and human experience. . . . There is not to be too much 
teaching. What the children need and crave is experience. The 
school’s main task is to supply opportunities that are so varied and 
attractive that . .. pupils will want to plunge in and enjoy the 
opportunities that are placed before them. 
All of these preliminary studies or experiences, whether geo- 
graphical, historical, literary, or scientific, like children’s play in 
general, need to be rich in details, full of human color, infinitely 
varied, touched lightly and then left behind, taken up as prompted 
by interest not by logic, superficial, repetitious, and loosely or- 
ganized. There is need of movement, irregularity, caprice, variety,

and incessant interplay of all the factors that compose the human 
spirit. For such are the ways of childhood, — and even of youth 
and adulthood in the hours of their freedom.! 
With these ideas to guide the general trend of thought, 
let us turn specifically to a consideration of the content, ar- 
rangement, and methods involved in each of the several sub- 
jects of the curriculum.

CHAPTER EIGHT 
PuysicaAL TRAINING AND HEALTH ! 
HE Committee on the Reorganization of Secondary 
Education has very properly assigned an important 
place to health instruction and physical training.’ Society 
at large, seemingly, is willing to approve the decision. Cer- 
tainly, no question is today receiving greater attention at 
the hands of organized reformers and social welfare workers 
than is this. The physician, the psychologist, the sociolo- 
gist, the judge of the juvenile court, the wardens of penal in- 
stitutions, the settlement worker, the religious missionary, 
and many others who deal with crime, poverty, and disease 
are in full accord respecting the influence of physical health on 
mental ability and moral character. Scientific studies re- 
cently made show conclusively that intelligence, social in- 
terest, and moral integrity depend to a large extent upon the 
health and physical vigor of the individual. Physical vigor 
leads to a pride in personal achievement; an interest in so- 
cial affairs; and the aspiration for, and attainment of, moral 
courage, mental force, and integrity. 
Bobbitt, in The Curriculum, expresses the idea thus: 
It makes a large difference whether the level of vitality is main- 
tained at fifty per cent of potential, or at one hundred per cent. 
The vocational demand for efficiency, when reduced to specifics, is a 
demand for forcefulness, for accuracy, for speed, for endurance, and 
for consistency or uniformity of work. And these are all fruits of a 
1 Throughout each of the succeeding chapters relating to particular 
subjects of study in the curriculum, the author has quoted extensively 
from school bulletins. He has done this deliberately, believing, first, that 
it is the more profitable to consider authoritative formulations and 
real working outlines; and second, that it would be presumptuous for 
him to speak dogmatically on all the several departments of work offered 
in a typical curriculum. 
_ *“Cardinal Principles of Secondary Education,” pages 3, 10, 11.

full vitality. ... The devitalized individual is nervous, inco- 
ordinate, uncertain in his movements and inhibitions. The range of 
his mental life is narrowed. He does not see so many things at one 
time, and his failure to observe all of the things related to his work 
involves him in mistakes and accidents. ... The physical condi- 
tion of an individual or of a nation is intimately related to the moral 
and civic character. ... For the man of very low vitality [pos- 
sesses] little power to hold many things in mind at once that are 
needed for seeing complex social relations. As a consequence, he 
is morally incapacitated. He misses the road, largely because he 
cannot see where it lies. He falls back upon the guidance of in- 
stinct, passion, and other crude impulsions.! 
Very naturally, therefore, society looks to the schools to 
produce the able-bodied, vigorous citizen; and the schools 
are beginning to accept society’s implied command and to 
obey it. 
PRESENT-DAY PROGRAMS IN PHYSICAL EDUCATION 
Until recently — and to an unjustifiable degree the con- 
dition is true even today — whatever effort was made by 
the schools directly to bring about better physical develop- 
ment centered in formal gymnastics and still more formal 
courses in physiology. These efforts were often unsuccess- 
ful. Neither health knowledge, health ideals, health inter- 
est, nor health habits resulted from them. The objectives 
being sought today call for a different method and one that 
provides for the following : 
1. Definite periods each day or week for physical educa- 
tion, including gymnasial instruction, folk dancing, 
free play, and games. 
Physical directors for both boys and girls. 
Boy and Girl Scout organizations. 
Corrective physical exercises. 
. Interclass and interschool athletics. 
. School physicians, nurses, and dentists. > Or

and posters to inculcate ideals and to stimulate re- 
sponses to health interests. 
14. An annual school health and play festival whereby the 
lessons of the school may be indirectly carried to par- 
ents and patrons, and ideals of health and bodily de- 
velopment may, through the exhibition of prowess 
and vigor among pupils, be disseminated among mem- 
bers of society at large. pet 7

(2) RELAXATION DRILLS (Eight minutes per day) 
All teachers will give at least four two-minute relaxation drills 
daily, one at the middle of each of the four class periods. The purpose 
of these drills is to ventilate rooms; to refresh pupils and teachers ; 
to develop quick, accurate, and orderly response to command; 
and to promote good posture. 
A series of graded exercises has been printed on cards for the 
seventh and eighth grades respectively, and a series of exercises 
suitable for ninth year students is available in stencil form. Teachers 
are requested to give to the grades only those exercises especially 
prepared for them. 
(3) TALKS ON HYGIENE (Twenty minutes per week) 
This instruction is to be given by the teachers in the science 
department and includes personal, school, and community hygiene. 
Particular emphasis is to be placed upon the formation of good health 
habits. In other words, teachers are requested to devise plans whereby 
they may know with some degree of certainty whether their 
instruction is made through the Student Organization of the junior 
high school for carrying on the work done in the elementary schools 
under the Rochester Health Club plan. 
The teaching of the principles of personal hygiene, as these prin- 
ciples relate to the daily life of the students, most naturally and 
logically lies within the province of the instructors of physical edu- 
cation. Plans are now being formulated whereby this instruction Nervous disorders LPP

The students may satisfy the recreational requirement by joining 
any one of the recreation clubs which meets the approval of the 
Director of Physical Education. 
(5) GYMNASTIC DRILLS (Sixty minutes per week) 
All students shall receive at least two half-hour periods of gym- 
nastic drill instruction each week under the direction of trained 
physical education instructors. This instruction shall be given as 
follows:

The following outline is taken from the Los jitek Cali- 
fornia, course of study, for 1916-1917. 
PHYSICAL EDUCATION (Girls) 
The purpose of this department is to determine the physical needs 
of each girl and provide such instructions, both theoretical and 
practical, as will result in her highest physical efficiency. This 
work continues throughout the Intermediate and High School course. 
In its theoretical course, this department codperates with the 
science and home economics departments in the study of hygienic 
living and the fundamental laws of health. It is designed to con- 
tribute valuable data to the formation of ideals of right living that 
will guide the student in the social and civic life of the community. 
The practical course is progressive and is planned to train the 
girl physically in activities which will best give her self-control and 
self-direction and lead her to the full realization of health and happi- 
ness. Because of the immense importance of the transitional period 
from childhood into early adolescence, special care is exercised in 
selecting the activities of these grades. 
Girls who, for any reason, cannot take the regular work are given 
special and corrective work according to their individual needs.

PHYSICAL EDUCATION (Boys) 
It is the aim of this department to provide such instruction and 
facilities as are necessary to enable all the pupils in the City Inter- 
mediate and High Schools to engage in those physical activities that 
are known to be of value in developing organic vigor, neuro-muscular 
strength and skill, codrdination, good posture, and certain desirable 
traits of character, such as courage, confidence, sound judgment, and 
will power; the physical possibilities, limitations, and control of the 
human body. 
A special effort is made to develop the habit of outdoor exercise, 
and to create and maintain an active interest in those athletic games 
that are sources of organic vigor, of vitality, of physical and mental 
efficiency. 
Particular care is exercised in selecting and adapting the activities 
to the various periods of adolescent life. 
Practical Course 
The practical course of two periods per week is required by all 
students through the Intermediate and High Schools. Any student, 
who, for any physical reason, is unable to take the regular work, is 
given corrective work suited to his individual needs.

INSTRUCTION REGARDING SEX 
A special subject of health education is the matter of in- 
struction in regard to sex. There are only three ways of 
dealing with this delicate subject: the first is to deny it a 
place in the school at all; the second is to deal with it di- 
rectly through courses specifically planned and administered ; 
and the third is the incidental, natural treatment of the sub- 
ject as occasion arises in connection with the regular work 
of the school. Educational theory today supports either a 
combination of the second and third of these plans, or else, 
where circumstances make it more desirable, the last one only. 
The United States Public Health Service, as well as many 
of the State Health Departments, is doing remarkably effective 
work in stimulating schools and parents to action and in 
spreading valuable information. The following excerpts 
from the United States Public Health Service Bulletin, 
-The Problem of Sex Education in Schools, are helpful. 
WHAT ALL TEACHERS MAY DO 
Certainly not all teachers are fitted to engage in direct sex teach- 
ing. This task is for a few teachers only and in a few subjects only. 
These few teachers must meet many requirements. They must 
have an accurate and scientific knowledge of the facts to be imparted 
and a thorough understanding of the pedagogy or method of treat- 
ment. There are other personal requirements also. Such teachers
-P-A-G-E-143
    PHYSICAL TRAINING AND HEALTH 133 
must have a wholesome attitude towards sex. They must not be 
soured or pessimistic through personal misfortunes, nor can they be 
trusted if they have their main interest in the abnormal, pathological 
aspects of sex, or exhibit a conspicuous emotional excitement in 
discussing it. A teacher with a flippant attitude or with doubtful 
personal probity is impossible. Some people have become very much 
absorbed in the newer psychopathology of sex life and without adequate 
background in theory or experience entertain quite radical views as 
to the psychological dangers of repressing sex feelings. Such persons 
would not make proper teachers. An ever-present danger is that 
teachers with missionary zeal will introduce the subject in their classes 
without proper textbooks or without getting counsel from experts 
in the field. Authorization from the school principal should be 
obtained. 
On the other hand, some teachers are successfully giving instruc- 
tion in sex, and there are many others who have the latent ability to 
do this highly important work, but are unable to do so because at 
present they do not know how. What they need is'instruction in 
subject matter and in methods. 
There are teachers who do not desire to teach sex hygiene in the 
classroom, but often feel the impulse to give help to individual, needy 
pupils with whom they come into close contact. This is an oppor- 
tunity not to be avoided. A teacher in such a situation should first 
get in touch with the parents. If there is no help in this 
direction, the teacher may be able either, himself, to help the pupil 
or else to put him in touch with the proper adviser. School nurses 
and physicians, if they are fitted by temperament for consultation, 
may often be called upon. Rarely, however, should a teacher or an 
adviser seek to give information to one of the opposite sex. 
Although the most important facts concerning the hygiene of 
sex can be given in a single talk or interview with a boy or girl at the 
age of thirteen or fourteen, the subject as a whole is much broader. 
It includes the whole process of reproduction and nurture of children, 
the meaning of marriage, prostitution, venereal diseases, illegiti- 
macy, and the hygiene of sound recreation. These cannot be taught 
at one time or place. They must be given at appropriate periods 
from early childhood to mature manhood and womanhood. And 
to be thorough, this education must be accomplished through the 
codperation of the homes, the churches, the schools, the press, clubs, 
and societies.
-P-A-G-E-144
  184 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
SEX INSTRUCTION IN THE CURRICULUM 
In planning to include sex education in the school curriculum, 
it should be realized that sex in life is not isolated as an experience 
or as a group of facts. It winds through many kinds of experiences 
at different ages and is a part of many kinds of facts. Few branches 
of knowledge or feeling do not touch sex problems. Few subjects 
can be taught properly with the sex aspects left out. An examination 
of the curriculum shows that society has had an official censor 
deleting sex from all classroom work under the orders of a now out- 
worn prudery. We find sex left out of all subjects, no matter how 
much the omission weakens or even falsifies them. In nature study, 
we begin with the baby animal and end with the death, giving no 
account of the renewal process; in anatomy, while three bodily 
cavities are named, the organs in only two are fully enumerated; 
in contagious diseases, venereal diseases are omitted; in theselections 
from literature, the sex motives are suppressed ; in history and civics, 
their significance is ignored. 
To introduce sex instruction, then, is not to add subjects but 
merely to lift the taboo from certain kinds of knowledge which form 
organic parts of courses in nature study, physical education, biology, 
physiology, and community civics or sociology. Sex knowledge is 
by this means given its normal place and can often be conveyed to 
pupils in their classes without the slightest consciousness on their 
part that what they are receiving is sex information. It can, more- 
over, be put into courses at the times in the pupil’s life when the 
knowledge is most needed, anticipating temptation by the instruction 
necessary for protection. 
There is still much experimenting to be done in particular courses. 
Enough has been accomplished by experts in biology, physiology, 
hygiene, and household arts during the last few years, however, to 
furnish teachers with precedents, methods, and material. 
Fuller information respecting the devices for teaching sex 
education can be obtained by addressing the United States 
Health Service, Washington, D.C. Among other agencies 
for accomplishing the task is the motion picture. The gov- 
ernment health service can furnish valuable information 
concerning the films of this kind that are available and suit-

  CHAPTER NINE 
ENGLISH 
Ww are the true aims of English teaching in the 
schools, particularly in the junior high school? Con- 
cisely put, they are: 
(1) To develop among pupils the power of clear, forceful, 
facile, and pleasing expression of thought, in both oral 
and written form. 
(2) To stimulate the taste for good literature and to give 
skill fairly to interpret it when read. 
(3) To give a knowledge of the worthy masterpieces of 
literature, both ancient and recent, and the power to 
discriminate wisely among the mass of current writ- 
ings of our own day. 
(4) To inculcate ideals of life sanctioned by the best 
present-day standards. 
A more detailed statement is given in a report of the Com- 
mittee on the Reorganization of Secondary Education as 
follows : 
The particular results to be sought in the teaching of English may 
be somewhat specifically indicated as follows : 
I. In general, the immediate aim of secondary English is twofold : 
(a) To give the pupil command of the art of expression in 
speech and in writing. 
(b) To teach him to read thoughtfully and with appreciation, 
to form in him a taste for good reading, and to teach him 
how to find books that are worth while. 
These two aims are fundamental; they must be kept in mind 
in planning the whole course and applied in the teaching of 
every term. 
II. Expression in speech includes : 
(a) Ability to answer clearly, briefly, and exactly a question 
on which one has the necessary information.

Ability to collect and organize material for oral dis- 
course. 
Ability to present with dignity and effectiveness to a 
class, club, or other group material already organized. 
Ability to join in a conversation or an informal dis- 
cussion, contributing one’s share of information or 
opinion, without wandering from the point and without 
discourtesy to others. 
Ability (for those who have or hope to develop qualities 
of leadership) to address an audience or conduct a public 
meeting, after suitable preparation and practice, with 
proper dignity and formality, but without stiffness or 
embarrassment. 
Ability to read aloud in such a way as to convey to the 
hearers the writer’s thought and spirit and to interest 
them in the matter presented. 
III. Expression in writing includes: 
(a) 
(0) 
(c) 
(d) 
(e) Ability to write a courteous letter according to the forms 
in general use, and of the degree of formality or in- 
formality appropriate to the occasion. 
Ability to compose on the first draft a clear and readable 
paragraph or series of paragraphs on familiar subject 
matter, with due observance of unity and order and with 
some specific detail. 
Ability to analyze and present in outline form the gist 
of a lecture or piece of literature, and to write an ex- 
pansion of such an outline. 
Ability, with due time for study and preparation, to 
plan and work out a clear, well-ordered, and interesting 
report of some length upon one’s special interests — 
literary, scientific, commercial, or what not. 
Ability (for those who have literary tastes or ambitions) 
to write a short story or other bit of imaginative com- 
position with some vigor and personality of style and in 
proper form to be submitted for publication, and to 
arrange suitable stories in form for dramatic presenta- 
tion. 
IV. Knowledge of books and power to read them thoughtfully and 
with appreciation includes :
-P-A-G-E-148

(e) 
  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
Ability to find pleasure in reading books by good authors, 
both standard and contemporary, with an increasing 
knowledge of such books and increasing ability to 
distinguish what is really good from what is trivial 
and weak. 
Knowledge of a few of the greatest authors, their lives, 
their chief works, and the reasons for their importance 
in their own age and in ours. 
Understanding of the leading features in structure and 
style of the main literary types, such as novels, dramas, 
essays, lyric poems. 
Skill in the following three methods of reading, and 
knowledge of when to use each: 
(1) Cursory reading, to cover a great deal of ground, 
getting quickly at essentials. 
(2) Careful reading, to master the book, with exact 
- understanding of its meaning and implications. 
(8) Consultation, to trace quickly and accurately a 
particular fact by means of indexes, guides, and 
reference books. 
The habit of weighing, line by line, passages of especial 
significance, while other parts of the book may be read 
but once. 
The power to enter imaginatively into the thought of an 
author, interpreting his meaning in the light of one’s 
own experience, and to show, perhaps by selecting pas- 
sages and reading them aloud, that the book is a source 
of intellectual enjoyment. 
V. The kinds of skill enumerated above are taught for three funda- 
(c) mental reasons : 
(a) Cultural. To open to the student new and higher forms 
of pleasure. 
(b) Vocational. To fit the student for the highest success 
in his chosen calling. 
Social and ethical. To present to the student noble 
ideals, aid in the formation of his character, and make 
him more efficient and actively interested in his rela- 
tions with and his service to others in the community and 
in the nation.!

CURRENT TEACHING OF ENGLISH 
In connection with the Grand Rapids School Survey,! 
the present writer had occasion to express his opinion in re- 
gard to the current teaching of English in the junior high 
school, an opinion that he has seen little reason to change. 
The paragraphs that follow, therefore, are practically a 
restatement of the ideas expressed in the report of the 
Survey. 
Most leaders of thought dealing with the teaching of the 
vernacular language and literature agree that detailed and 
exhaustive courses in formal English grammar — particu- 
larly during the early years of school life — are a waste of 
much precious time for teachers and pupils alike. Such 
courses are discouraging and distasteful requirements for 
many types of youths, and to a large degree they fail in ef- 
fecting the ends for which they are designed and presented. 
It is doubtful if formal grammar serves as the best means for 
developing the ideals that are sought in the work of English, 
particularly when taught as an isolated subject considerably 
apart from its concrete connection with daily human expres- 
sion and current readings. As presented by many teachers, 
it is treated as an end in itself, not as a means to a more note- 
worthy end. The true way to acquire habits of correct oral 
and written speech and the power to analyze the thought of 
literary selections is by speaking, writing, and analyzing re- 
peatedly, under the stress of current needs or real motives, 
not in a formal, abstract manner under circumstances that 
are artificial and forced. In like manner, the way to develop 
a refined taste and a true appreciation of literature is by the 
repeated study of works of literary merit, following always, 
however, the universally accepted pedagogical law of pro- 
ceeding slowly and gradually from the child’s immediate

interests to the interests of more mature life, and providing 
constantly for variety of form and subject matter in the 
studies that are presented. 
Although in the junior high school work these ideals and 
maxims are acknowledged in theory, they are not always 
put into operation in practices so fully as seems desirable. 
Throughout the seventh and eighth grades, formal English 
grammar is frequently prescribed for every pupil, except per- 
chance for the few whose linguistic attainments have been 
sufficiently satisfactory to permit them to be enrolled in 
courses in Latin. Even then, however, fifty per cent of the 
time allotment is expected to be used for work in English 
grammar. 
Much of the teaching of grammar in our schools is good, 
and pupil responses not infrequently are highly creditable. 
Nevertheless, for many students, it is evident that the sub- 
ject is of little interest and of doubtful profit. Much of the 
reading in our schools is truly a study of literature for its 
content value, but in as many instances the aim seems to be 
to secure form and fluency only — and even this is not al- 
ways well done. Moreover, there is little freedom accorded 
the teacher in the selection of the material to be studied. 
A great deal of the material contained in textbooks is un- 
attractive to many students. Some of America’s magazines 
of today, a few of the worth-while contemporary books of 
adventure, fiction, biography, history, and description, and 
some of the excellently arranged supplementary school readers 
certainly ought to be allowed a place in any English course. 
Educational theorists have for some time asserted that six 
years devoted to the formal aspects of reading, writing, and 
spelling are sufficient to give to all normal children the fun- 
damentals of those arts, and that whatever additional train- 
ing is provided should be secured incidentally in connection 
with the teaching of content studies. Why any junior high
-P-A-G-E-151
ENGLISH 141 
school, in view of these established theories, should continue 
to adhere strictly to traditional practices is not clear. With 
much stress upon the formal aspect of English, there surely 
is a lack of time available for the content side. Moreover, 
the question persistently arises: Are ten periods (or even 
seven or eight periods) a week devoted to English in all its 
phases the best possible distribution of time for all types of 
mind, or even for the majority of pupils in the junior high 
school? May not the policy of allowing certain pupils of 
keen language interests to substitute Latin, French, Spanish, 
or German for formal English grammar be a wise policy to 
adopt for other types of pupils; that is, for those who do not 
profit greatly by any formal language study? May not, in 
concrete, a course in business English, shop English, conver- 
sational English, magazine English, or one embodying ele- 
ments from all such fields, be fittingly employed more freely 
than at present? 
Undeniably, his own language and literature are pre- 
eminently important for every one of us. Hence some type 
of course in English should be pursued by every pupil in 
every grade in the junior high school. But it is seriously 
questioned whether much of what is offered or prescribed in 
English in most of the junior high schools of the country is 
well chosen. What a large number of pupils will find most 
valuable is a course in which literary selections are largely 
taken from current writings dealing with science, nature, 
industry, travel, biography, history, current events, and social 
questions, and from current fiction. Such a course would 
base the expressional work, both oral and written, upon the 
impressions gained through the study of the selections and 
through the everyday experiences of life. True develop- 
ment in language power comes from having something to say 
and a motive for saying it forcefully, fittingly, and under- 
standingly. 2

METHODS SUGGESTED 
Perhaps no more suggestive article relating to the teach- 
ing of English in the Junior High School has lately appeared 
than the one by Professor Walter Barnes, in the School Review 
for September, 1919. In it, Barnes presents ten statements 
accompanied by fifteen suggestions bearing upon the subject 
of English. The suggestions, somewhat paraphrased and 
condensed, follow : 
(1) The individual reading method should now supplant the class 
method. Instead of all pupils reading the same poem or essay, each 
child should be given an opportunity to choose themes and forms 
and types of literature to suit his taste. The recitation hour should 
be devoted to discussions of books read, interchange of opinion, 
discovery of canons of taste and of literary art, correction of false 
impressions, and occasional reading aloud of passages that are worth 
reading aloud. 
(2) In composition work, each pupil should select his own themes 
and forms . . . the teacher seeing to it that no form of expression 
that is absolutely indispensable to the average citizen in a democracy 
is utterly ignored. | 
(3) In literature and composition, the pupil should be given oppor- 
tunities of testing himself out, of tacking and sailing hither and yon. 
He should be encouraged to range widely, to read this author for a 
time, then forsake him; he may be expected to hate the things he 
formerly loved and to love the things he formerly hated. He should 
not be required to “‘study” one author for a semester or spend two 
- months in intensive reading of one book; he should not be asked to 
tell stories or write explanations for a long stretch of time. 
(4) Projects of diverse kinds should now be features of the Eng- 
lish work. Library societies may be organized and school papers 
published. ‘The socialized recitation is the natural means of con- 
ducting both literature and language work. 
(5) A goodly portion of the reading in the junior high school 
should be biography and history and legend. 
(6) The teacher should provide an audience for all expression. 
Written work should be read aloud to the class, read by a 
committee, passed around among members of the class, displayed
-P-A-G-E-153
  ENGLISH - 148 
on the wall, printed in the school paper, or in some other way given 
publicity. 
(7) The teacher should use this period to enlarge and enrich the 
pupil’s stock of words. 
(8) In their reading, the children of the junior high school age 
should be encouraged to run at large over the enchanted region of 
Munchausen, Barrie, Macdonald, Ingelow, Craik, Baum, and 
Stockton, and deal with such stories as Tanglewood Tales, The Wonder 
Book, The Ancient Mariner, Tales from Shakespeare, and similar 
writings. 
(9) In their theme work, the children should be allowed to give 
expression to the romantic and fanciful ideas that well up within 
them. ‘Trips to the moon, fanciful autobiographies, fairy tales, 
dream stories, make-believe travels, all are natural to this period 
of childhood. 
(10) Close analysis of style and worship of standards of elegance, 
purity and prettiness of diction are out of place... . Itis content 
that counts; the boys want reading with substance. 
(11) The natural language of children on this plane of their de- 
velopment is colloquial, idiomatic, free and easy, rough and ready. 
Ideals of correctness and propriety should be advanced with pru- 
dence, tact, and common sense. : 
(12) Functional grammar can now be justified . . . though heavy 
courses in the traditional technical grammar are entirely out of 
place here. 
(13) Some of the reading should be from current magazines. 
(14) Here particularly children must be allowed to speak and 
write of their native interests and experiences. 
(15) The utmost care must be taken in criticizing language and 
composition work. . .. The good teacher will make the atmos- 
phere of the English class wholesome and inspiring and will teach 
through success, not failure.* 
A list of books suitable for Junior High School stu- 
dents is given in Appendix B, page 426, and a short list 
of stories of adventure will be found in Appendix C (page 
435).

COURSES OF STUDY IN ENGLISH 
The West Virginia Course of Study 
In the Course of Study for the Junior and Senior High 
Schools of West Virginia, issued in 1921, many helpful ideas 
respecting the teaching of English are to be found. Certain 
excerpts and adaptations from that Report follow : 
English includes two groups of subjects: the Reading-Literature 
group and the Language-Composition group. These are so different 
in content and in the mental activities involved that they should be 
kept almost separate and, if possible, taught by different teachers. 
The first group is related to the attainment of culture, of szesthetic 
pleasure, of a rich, round character; it should prepare one for profit- 
able use of his leisure. ‘The second group is related to the achieve- 
ment of efficiency, to utility; it should prepare for practical success 
in life. ‘The two should not be taught by the same methods nor aim 
at the same results, nor should the content of either one be carried 
over to the other. Subjects drawn from literature are the dullest 
and most uninteresting themes for speaking and writing ; attempting 
to enlarge pupils’ vocabulary by words met in literature interferes 
with satisfactory methods of teaching literature and produces very 
meager practical results. Conversely, composition should not be 
used for the purpose of increasing appreciation of literature or for 
any other cultural purpose; it should be used for the directly prac- 
tical purposes of teaching pupils to organize and express thoughts. 
Grammar, Rhetoric, Spelling, the Lives of Authors, and the 
History of Literature should be considered not as valuable in and of 
themselves but valuable in proportion as they assist in the realiza- 
tion of the two major aims of the English course: to give power, 
skill, taste, and enjoyment in reading, and to give fluency, effective- 
ness, force, and correctness in speaking and writing. 
One of the foundation principles of the work in Literature is that 
the student should read much, a great deal more than is provided in 
the average high school at present. An objection urged often — 
and justly — against the traditional work in Literature in the high 
school is that there is too much close and detailed study of master- 
pieces, too much verbal and linguistic analysis, too much formal and 
critical study. Often a class spends two or three weeks on Milton’s 
DL’ Allegro or Longfellow’s Miles Standish, analyzing and dissecting
-P-A-G-E-155
  
ENGLISH 145 
  until the students are so bored they never want to hear of Milton or 
Longfellow again. 
Throughout this course necessity for rapid reading is implied. 
The course is laid down in the belief that the emotion and the thought 
can be extracted in a half or a fourth of the time that has usually 
been spent on a selection. But to do this requires emphasis on the 
essentials and elimination of the non-essentials. It requires careful 
planning on the teacher’s part and joy and animation in the class 
discussion. It requires much outside reading at the rate of one book 
amonth. Above all it requires a new point of view in the teacher : 
the belief that Literature exists to give intelligent pleasure, to arouse 
strong, pure emotions, to lead to knowledge and wisdom; not to 
communicate facts, not to discipline the mind, not to satisfy tradi- 
tional and conventional notions about “knowing the classics through 
and through.” It has been amply demonstrated again and again 
that rapid reading is most likely to be good reading. The toilsome 
pace to which we hold children down frustrates the essential pur- 
pose of reading. 
Throughout the junior and senior high schools the individual 
reading method should be employed for at least one fourth the 
time that is devoted to the work in Literature. In this method each 
child reads a book that he selects for himself from a list approved by 
the teacher. (The teacher should be so liberal in her tastes that she 
will approve any wholesome book not on the list.) The child should 
be trained to read rapidly, to determine almost as he starts the book 
what is the nature and the theme of the book, to analyze the charac- 
ters, to anticipate the events in the plot and to perceive the bearing 
of each incident on the course of the story — in short, to handle 
the book deftly, skillfully, getting that enjoyment out of it that an 
intelligent mature reader gets from books. The recitation periods 
should be devoted to informal oral reports and discussions, each pupil 
telling what book he is reading or has lately read, how he enjoyed it 
and why, what are the chief sources of interest, etc., while the teacher 
should correct false impressions, point out that which the pupil may 
have overlooked, assist in interpreting and understanding. Reading 
done in this way is invaluable in preparing children for the kind of 
reading they will engage in after they leave school. 
By means of plentiful reading of newspapers and magazines in 
class and of outside reading of current fiction, essays, and poetry, 
the students are made acquainted with the best of modern writing.
-P-A-G-E-156
146 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
  It is not claimed that all or most of this is great Literature; that has 
been provided, too, in full measure in other details of the course. 
It is claimed merely that most men and women who read at all read 
modern books and periodicals, that there is a natural and sound 
reason for this, and that the high school course in English should 
try to give the students power of discrimination between the best 
and the poorest, should try to set up standards of judgment, should 
train in taste. 
It may be truly said that any high school course in Literature 
that does not create a taste for reading and train to reading habits 
in its students has failed in one of its chief functions. If a high 
school graduate does not like to read, it is a reflection on the high 
school. 
The Report, too, makes the following pertinent observa- 
tions respecting the handling of books and instruction 
therein : 
Many graduates of the junior high school are weak in one very 
important respect: they are unable to handle books effectively and 
economically. Instruction and training in the use of books should 
be given in connection with every subject, but upon the English 
teacher falls the main responsibility. For this reason two recitation 
periods out of the twenty apportioned to English are used specifically 
for the definite, systematic teaching and training in the use of books. 
Among the topics to be emphasized are: opening a new book, taking 
care of books, the preface and introduction, table of contents, chapter 
divisions, sub-heads, figures, letters, etc., inserted as guides to the 
thought, cross-references, footnotes, pictures, diagrams, maps, 
supplements, bibliographies, indexes; scanning a book to get a 
general idea of its contents and nature. Practice is to be given in the 
rapid reading of chapters and sections and the summarizing of the 
contents, and in finding topic sentences in paragraphs, etc. 
This work includes also the use of dictionaries, encyclopedias, and 
reference books and practice in rapidity and accuracy in looking up 
points. Newspapers and magazines should be analyzed, to deter- 
’ mine the nature and material, the important features, etc. 
Taking up more specifically the question of composition 
and other aspects of the expressional work, the Report says:
-P-A-G-E-157
  
  ENGLISH 147 
The Composition work of this course is based on the principle that 
the Oral and Written Composition work in school should prepare the 
students for the kind of speaking and writing they will be called upon 
to do in life . . . it is not at all the function of the high school 
course in Composition to train authors, orators, journalists. It is the 
primary function of the high school course in Composition to train in 
organizing thought and expressing ideas by those means and in those 
forms that the average man and woman use. ... The speaking 
of the average man and woman is conversation, stories, exposition, 
and argument. The high school course in Composition, therefore, 
should provide thorough training in these forms. The writing of 
formal descriptions, book reviews, type short-stories . . . should 
. be almost eliminated. 
At least half the time available for Composition work 
should be devoted to training in speech. 
Training in speech includes definite, consistent training in what 
is called Oral Composition. This is the telling of stories, the com- 
posing and speaking of expositions, the delivering of arguments, the 
giving of informal book reviews. The securing and organizing of 
material should be carried on for Oral Composition in much the same 
manner as it is for Written Composition ; but the composition should 
be spoken instead of written. Criticism of Oral Compositions should 
emphasize not so much the language used and the manner of delivery, 
as the arranging of material, the qualities of unity, coherence, em- 
phasis, etc. 
The qualities most desirable in the writing and speech of high 
school students are: clearness, unity, and coherence of thought and 
arrangement; and force, expressiveness, picturesqueness, natural- 
ness, and ease of language. 
The compositions of many high school students are poorly con- 
structed and couched in stilted, laborious “literary” English. 
Standards of elegance and propriety have been lifted up; ease, 
lightness, and the use of colloquial, idiomatic language have been 
frowned down. In consequence the students have not expressed 
themselves with animation and spontaneity, with humor and in the 
vernacular. They have not “let themselves go”; they have re- 
pressed the-tendency to reveal their thoughts by free, forceful 
speech. 
To attain clearness, unity, and coherence of thought and arrange- 
ment the student must be trained in organizing his thoughts; to sift
-P-A-G-E-158
148 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
his material, to seize upon essentials and subordinate non-essentials, 
to arrange the material in the logical and effective order, to paragraph 
thoughtfully, to mark the path of thought by guide-words. This 
means training in making outlines, in thinking entirely through a 
subject, in going to the heart of the matter and going to the bottom 
of it. The teacher should spend much more time than is usually 
spent in guiding the students in “laying out” their subjects, in con- 
structing simple outlines, in making the subjects clear to themselves 
before trying to make it clear to others. This is essentially train- 
ing in thought. 
To attain the desirable qualities of language the student must be 
in the proper attitude toward his work. The subject must be one 
in which he is interested, one over which he has some mastery so 
that he can feel at ease with it. Furthermore, he must not be ham- 
pered by the fear of severe criticism to follow. He must be encouraged 
to express himself freely, naturally, picturesquely — with exaggera- 
tion sometimes and with humor sometimes, with effective slang and 
colloquialism. Finally, he should have, whenever possible, a com-’ 
pelling motive for composition. 
Continuing the discussion with especial reference to spell- 
ing and grammar, the Report says: 
The English course as here outlined does not suggest any specific 
periods for spelling. ‘That does not mean, however, that spelling is 
not to be taught. . . . The best way to teach spelling is through the 
written work of the students. The teacher and student should keep 
a list of words misspelled in the writing, and at least once a month a 
period should be given up to spelling drills on the common and diffi- 
cult words misspelled during the month. 
Grammar can be best taught in connection with Literature and 
Composition work. Often a student fails to get the meaning from a 
sentence he is reading because he does not perceive the grammatical 
construction of certain words; this is the time to teach that gram- 
matical construction. Often a student makes a grammatical blunder 
in his speech or writing; this is the time to teach that grammatical 
fact. ... This is the best kind of grammar teaching, since it 
comes at the moment when the student sees the value and the appli- 
cation of the grammatical fact or principle. 
It is desirable, however, to take one period every two weeks for 
definite, systematic instruction in English grammar.
-P-A-G-E-159
ENGLISH 149 
It may be set down as a general principle that no detail of grammar 
should be taught that does not have direct relation to the students’ 
reading, speaking, and writing. Grammar should not be taught for 
mental discipline. Grammar should not be taught to prepare for 
foreign language. Grammar should not be taught as a science. 
Grammar should be taught only as a practical aid in the art of lan- 
guage expression. 
Finally, the Report concludes its discussion of English 
with the following general admonitions respecting adminis- 
tration : 
There are, of course, essential differences in the nature and the 
interests of junior high and senior high school students; naturally, 
therefore, the English work in the two sections of the high school 
should be different. In the junior high school, the course in English, 
both in Literature and in Composition and Language, should be 
extensive — that is, should offer the children a wide variety in 
authors and types and styles of reading material, and no less wide a 
variety in the themes, types, and kinds of composition work. In 
the senior high school the English course should be comparatively 
intensive; the children may be expected to confine themselves a 
little more straitly, to study one author or type for a longer period 
and somewhat more closely. The junior high school should give the 
pupils opportunities to try themselves out in every way, the senior high 
school should offer opportunities to specialize more in their favorite 
kinds of work. But these differences should not be magnified; the 
course in both sections of the school should be flexible and should 
give every child the chance to discover his talents and develop them, 
to work extensively and intensively. 
- The present writer finds himself in accord with the ideas 
voiced in the quotations from this Report. | 
The Rochester Course of Study in English 
It is a fairly easy task to criticize existing practices and, 
also, to set up modified goals of attainment. It is a more dif- 
ficult matter to organize the actual school practices and to 
get the aims realized. It is worth while to inquire how the
-P-A-G-E-160
  150 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
work is being undertaken. The following excerpts from the 
Course of Study for Junior High Schools, Rochester, New 
York, 1919, show how one city is meeting the problem: 
Aim of the Work in Composition 
The aim of the junior high school course of study in Composition 
is to provide a program that will train the students to talk distinctly 
and in an interesting, convincing manner: that will develop a sen- 
tence sense which will enable them to express themselves clearly and 
definitely, whether in speech or in writing; and that will give them 
the ability to write pleasing, concise, effective English unmarred by 
misspelled words or the common ungrammatical expressions. 
Correct Speech 
While the reason for the correct form will play an important 
part in helping certain types of students to speak and to write cor- 
rectly and will prove a valuable aid when they are in doubt about a 
particular expression, nothing but the most careful drill in the use of 
the forms that we attempt to teach will result in forming the correct 
habits of speaking and of writing which we seek to inculcate. 
Teaching a given lesson merely points the way for the correct 
expression of particular ideas. Careful and constant drill is neces- 
sary to fix the correct form in the mind of the student. By means of 
a sufficient number of exercises, the student must have ample 
practice in the matter of correct choice between two or more forms 
of expression to give him confidence in his ability to choose and to 
use the correct form. In our work in English, it is knowledge re- 
duced to practice that counts. 
That form of drill which to the greatest degree enlists the interest 
of the child will produce the most satisfactory results. . En- 
courage students to invent games in accordance with the needs of the 
particular class and to add their own suggestions to games outlined 
by the teacher. 
Begin the correct speech campaign as soon as the students enter 
the junior high school, by correcting and tabulating the common 
errors of the members of each class. In observing and recording the 
errors of his fellow students, each member of the class is developing a 
sensitiveness to correct speech that is absolutely necessary, if any 
real progress is to be made. The topics under ‘‘Correct Speech” 
outlined for each grade have been arranged with reference to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
  ENGLISH 151 
grammar taught during the term. The outline merely indicates the 
points that have been assigned for particular emphasis, provided 
the students need correction along the lines suggested. The kind 
and amount of work done in each class must always be determined 
by the particular needs of the class. 
Oral English 
At least one half of the work should be oral in both the seventh 
and eighth grades. It should be remembered, however, that it is not 
mere talking but talking to some purpose that counts. There should 
be a definite relation between the oral and the written work. Good, 
clear enunciation and correct pronunciation are prime essentials. 
We should not fail to continue emphasis on the importance of pro- 
nouncing all the syllables in each word and sounding final consonants, 
even though the task is difficult and discouraging. Strive to make 
the students realize that, by mastering correct English, they are not 
only making definite progress toward success in any line of work that 
they may elect, but that the right word in the right place has a 
distinct value in all their school work. 
Dictation 
Dictation exercises, if rightly used, will prove a valuable aid in 
fixing habits of using the technicalities of written language correctly. 
This work also affords a means of testing the power of the students to 
apply in written work what they are supposed to have learned about 
capitals, punctuation, abbreviations, etc. 
In this type of work it is possible for the students to give their 
entire attention to matters of form, as the content is dictated by the 
teacher. Teachers should, of course, keep in mind the fact that 
dictation exercises are largely mechanical and are given for the pur- 
pose of testing or fixing facts already taught. They are not teaching 
exercises. 
Grammar 
The junior high school course recognizes the value of systematized 
knowledge obtained through the study of formal grammar. This 
knowledge, however, is not to be counted of primary importance in 
itself and, therefore, must be considered in relation to the present 
language needs of students. .. . Sets of sentences are not to be 
devised merely for the sake of exemplifying principles of grammar,
-P-A-G-E-162
  152 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
but these principles are to be utilized wherever they add essentially 
in securing clearness or correctness of expression, either oral or 
written.! 
The following constitute a partial list of subjects for oral 
or written work for all grades of the junior high school in 
Rochester : ' 
I. IMAGINATIVE STORIES 
In taking up this type of work, the teacher should be very careful 
not to permit the students to select subjects that will tend to lead 
them beyond the realm of their own experiences and thus make their 
stories unreal rather than sincere expressions of their own ideas.

Why All Students Should Have Some 
Hand Work 
In teaching literature, the following paragraphs and outlines 
taken from published Courses of Study are helpful : 
I. Extensive Rather than Intensive Work for Seventh and Eighth 
Grades. 
The present plan for the work in literature for the seventh and 
eighth grades is based on the idea that pupils in these grades should 
read a number of stories and get the one or two big ideas that the 
author intended to convey. Expressing it in the words of Professor 
Thomas H. Briggs of Columbia University, ‘‘We are now standing
-P-A-G-E-164
154 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
for one thought out of fifty masterpieces rather than fifty thoughts . 
out of one masterpiece.” Under the former plan, the children were 
quite apt to miss the one big idea in spending too much time over 
details. Under the present plan, these details are provided for in 
other phases of the work in English; or are left for later years of the 
course, when the students have attained greater maturity and have 
accumulated a larger background for the more intensive study of 
literature. 
II. Literature Selected Must Appeal to the Child. 
Children are bound to read. It is therefore our duty to ascertain 
and to consider their present interest, thus helping them to do better 
what they are bound to do, for in this way we may be able to show 
them other and greater possibilities. The child is sure to be most 
interested in that selection of literature in which he sees the largest 
relation to himself or to which he is most able to relate himself. 
The pupil’s desire for more literature by the same author or of the 
same type is good evidence that this particular kind of literature is 
producing a satisfactory emotional response and that he is, at least, 
getting something of what the author intended him to get. 
Ill. The Short Story. 
The short story lends itself well to supplementary reading, as it 
appeals to the child who likes to hear stories, to read stories, and to 
tell stories. For the literature work in junior high school, the stories 
must be most carefully selected because the students are passing 
through that period of adolescence when everything read leaves its 
mark. Ifthe stories stimulate desirable enthusiasms, reinforce good 
motives, and give a delightful first-hand acquaintance with the 
writings of authors of recognized merit, they will play an important 
part in shaping the student’s reading throughout future years. Eager 
and appreciative reading of stories of this type will result in the 
formation of the invaluable habit of turning to good books for com- 
panionship in leisure hours. Short stories that are direct, forceful, 
and appealing also furnish an excellent foundation for the more 
intensive study of literature later on. 
IV. Silent Reading. 
Oral reading, important as it may be, will never play as large a 
part in the life of the ordinary individual as silent reading. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
  
    
ENGLISH 155 
_ future information and consequent effectiveness of our students will 
depend largely upon what and how they read. It is, therefore, the 
duty of the school not only to create a taste for good reading, but 
also to train the students so that they will get the largest possible 
results from their silent reading when no one is present to offer sug- 
gestion or to aid in the interpretation. Under this plan, far less 
emphasis is placed on word drill, pronunciation exercises, and oral 
expression as a part of the reading, because this work is left to be 
taken up at some other time according to instructions given in the 
regular outline in English. In their silent reading, students should 
be trained to depend more largely upon the context for the meaning 
of words and should be taught to interpret the dictionary definition 
in the light of the sentence or paragraph in which the unfamiliar 
word is found. 
V. Discussion of the Story. 
Through discussion following the silent reading, the teacher has 
an opportunity to stimulate the imaginative and emotional faculties 
of the students and thus help them really to live with the characters 
in the story so that they think and feel with them. In this way, 
students may also be led to sense the author’s point of view, to appre- 
ciate his descriptions, to realize something of what it means to be 
able to use just the right words to express thought. ‘They should 
be encouraged to select favorite passages, to give general impres- 
sions, to discuss the different characters, and to tell personal expe- 
riences like those related in the story. If they are to do this, they 
must enjoy the story, not merely tolerate it. 
VI. Suggestive Questions Help to Stimulate the Discussion of a 
Story. 
1. Questions of the teacher. 
What part of the story interested you most? Why? 
Have you found any character that you would like to 
have for your friend? Why? 
What characters do you dislike? Why? 
Did you find any surprises in the story ? 
Did the story end as you expected? If not, why? 
How does this story compare with the one we read last ? 
Is there anything in this story that reminds you of any 
other story you have read or of any experience you 
have ever had?
-P-A-G-E-166
    156 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
2. Questions of the students. 
One of the most helpful ways of getting students to take a vital 
part in the discussion of the story is to allow them to question each 
ther. rience RECOMMENDATIONS 
That the practices enumerated in the foregoing pages 
are in general harmony with the best formulated thought of 
the day may perhaps be substantiated by comparing them 
with the recommendations made to the North Central Asso- 
ciation of Colleges and Secondary Schools, by its Com- 
mittee on English, in March, 1922. That part of the re- 
port which relates directly to the junior high school follows. 
A. COMPOSITION Grade VII 
The materials for composition in Grade VII should be derived 
from the children’s play; their work in school and out; their direct 
observations of processes, scenes, objects, and occupations; the 
books they read; and their imagination. The nature and spirit 
of written work most appropriate for this grade may be found in 
informal letter-writing which draws its content from the sources 
named earlier in this paragraph. Formal compositions and themes 
assigned as such should be discouraged. 
B. MINIMUM ESSENTIALS 
To secure correctness there must be secured a mastery of at least 
enough of the technique of language to include subject and predicate, 
object, predicate noun and adjective, recognition of the parts of 
speech by function, inflection of nouns and personal pronouns for 
number and case, the idea of tense, and clauses and phrases as groups. 
The results should be sentence-sense, larger vocabulary, increased 
power of observation, organization, and expression. 
To secure correctness there must be attained a mastery of certain 
fundamentals in the technique of language. In Grade VII, there 
should be investigation of the language habits of all pupils so that 
instruction may begin at the proper level. The aim should be to 
master these topics: recognition of the parts of speech by function ; 
subject and predicate, object, predicate noun and adjective; inflec- 
tion of nouns and personal pronouns for number and case; the idea

  158 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
of tense; clause and phrases as groups of words with the functions 
of single words; and necessary punctuation. Words used in all 
school subjects must be spelled correctly. 
C. READING | 
For the general reading in this and the following grades, there 
should be provided a wide range of books, papers, and magazines 
dealing with wholesome living, worthy home membership, vocations, 
citizenship, the worthy use of leisure, and right conduct. Poetry, 
fiction, science, art, ethics, civics, sociology, history, biography, and 
travel should be included, both new and classic. For class work in 
Grade VII, some of the shorter poems of Longfellow and Whittier ; 
Miles Standish; Evangeline; The Great Stone Face; Rip Van 
Winkle; The Legend of Sleepy Hollow; Treasure Island; The Gold 
Bug; Stories of King Arthur; and The Jungle Books are of about 
the right grade of difficulty. 
D. INDIVIDUAL NEEDS 
In line with the foregoing paragraphs, in Grades VII, VIII, and IX 
there must be recognition of the wide range of differences in language 
attainment found in any group of pupils. By the use of objective 
measurenients, weaknesses and proficiencies may be discovered, 
the needs of individuals diagnosed, and suitable materials of instruc- 
tion determined. Instruction in language control must increasingly 
turn away from uniform class procedure toward differentiation and 
adaptation to individual needs. 
A. COMPOSITION Grade VIII 
In addition to the composition materials suggested for Grade VII, 
it is advisable in Grade VIII, to use civic questions, imaginary 
journeys, admirable characters in life or books, questions of school 
life, trips. These may be treated in expositions, narratives, de- 
scriptions, conversations, discussions, letters. Particular attention 
should be given, in this and all subsequent grades, to the art of 
making well-organized, fluent, and correct recitations and reports in 
other subjects. Progress should be made in the planning of themes, 
the manipulation of sentences, spelling, and punctuation. 
B. GRAMMAR 
The study of grammar in Grade VIII should add a mastery of the 
essential elements of the sentence (subject, predicate, modifiers, 
connectives), of clauses as parts of compound and complex sen-
-P-A-G-E-169
  ENGLISH 159. 13d 
tences, of common and proper nouns, of classes of pronouns, of tHe’ 
person, number, and voice of verbs, of the classification and compari- 
son of adjectives and adverbs, of the choice of prepositions, of 
conjunctions as codrdinating and subordinating. 
C. READING 
As material for class work in literature in Grade VIII, some of the 
short poems of Holmes, Lanier, Riley, and Field; Snowbound; 
The Lay of the Last Minstrel; Horatius; The Tales of a Wayside Inn; 
Norse Myths; Cooper’s novels; Kidnapped; Captains Courageous ; 
Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm; A Midsummer Night's Dream; The 
Tempest; Franklin’s Autobiography; and Warner’s In the Wilder- 
ness offer a reasonable range. 
A. COMPOSITION Grade IX 
Particular vocations and current events may be added in Grade 
IX to the composition materials. The most available means of 
attaining clearness, force, and interest in composition should be pre- 
sented informally; the chief features of explanation and narrative 
should be learned inductively; much drill should be devoted to 
social and business letters, spelling, word structure, and punctuation. 
At the end of Grade IX, a pupil should be able to avoid any ordinary 
error in grammar, to improve expression by varying grammatical 
structure, and to write good social and business letters. 
B. GRAMMAR 
Such grammar should be taught as is necessary for use or to supple- 
ment previous deficiencies. 
C. READING 
Among the poems suitable for Grade IX are Hervé Riel, The 
Courtin’, The Lady of the Lake, To a Skylark, The Concord Hymn, 
On First Looking into Chapman’s Homer, My Captain, To Helen. 
Poe’s Purloined Letter, Hawthorne’s Ambitious Guest, O. Henry’s 
Chaparral Prince, Davis’s Gallegher, and Hale’s Man Without a 
Country are the kind of stories recommended for this grade. Ivan- 
hoe, Quentin Durward, and Kim are desirable novels; Julius Cesar 
is the best play; Irving’s Christmas Sketches are useful; and Palmer’s 
Odyssey and Bryant’s Iliad (in part), with related myths, are well- 
nigh indispensable.!

  CHAPTER TEN 
FoREIGN LANGUAGES 
HAT foreign languages constitute subjects of study 
worthy of inclusion in most types of secondary schools 
is, doubtless, a statement that few educated men would 
challenge. That these studies merit the emphasis which 
has been placed upon them during the past three hundred 
years, or that they are absolutely essential to the effective 
intellectual and moral training of all types of pupils, is a be- 
lief that is today being questioned, if not completely denied, 
by many. 
The reasons for the criticisms directed against much of 
the language work in the schools are: (1) inability on the 
part of many individuals who have studied foreign languages 
to make effective use of them; (2) the reversal of the dogma 
of formal discipline, which for so long a time served as an 
argument for the study of languages; and (3) the growing 
belief that true culture consists of large stores of information 
relating to contemporary life and of specific disciplines con- 
nected with current affairs, rather than of a training cen- 
tered almost entirely in experiences remote from the direct 
concerns of the world today. 
These criticisms in no way seek to deny the enormous 
values which the study of the past has for the present. Each 
generation stands, so to speak, upon the shoulders of the ear- 
lier one. Life is an evolution. Doubtless all that is good 
and beneficent in the past is exerting its influence upon the 
world today. To appreciate fully the significance of many 
of the current social, economic, and political activities and 
practices, it is necessary for an individual to trace them to 
their origin. However, the conviction is strong in many edu- 
cators that the tracing process is not necessarily to be car- 
160
-P-A-G-E-171
  
FOREIGN LANGUAGES 161 
ried on in various languages. The best of the past can be 
learned by means of translations and treatises prepared by 
professional scholars. 
Nevertheless, foreign-language study, for certain pupils, 
yields positive values of such a nature that they may not be 
ignored. The subject is firmly established in the curriculum, 
and rightly so. The pertinent questions relating to it are, 
therefore, those pertaining to the particular language or lan- 
guages to be provided, the aims to be sought through study, 
the selection of the content material, the place accorded to 
the subject in the organization of courses, and the methods 
to be employed in its teaching. 
In seeking to answer these questions, let it not be forgotten 
that the fundamental aims and purposes of the junior high 
school are first, to discover the individual and his world to 
the pupil himself; and second, so to guide and direct him in 
his choice of school work, life vocation, and conduct that he 
may realize, as completely as possible, the personality which 
is potentially his, and may, through the realization and ex- 
pression of his personality, accept his share of responsibility 
and make a definite contribution to the world’s happiness. 
Hence, merely as an agency for testing pupils’ capacities, 
interests, and tastes, foreign-language study in the junior 
high school finds ample justification. For pupils who can 
profit from an extended course in languages, the opportunity 
to begin linguistic study in the seventh or eighth grade is 
both a personal right and a social advantage. Besides, it 
is a well-accepted pedagogical principle that the most appro- 
priate time in which to begin to study a foreign language is 
in the earlier years of life. 
THE NEED FOR A GENERAL INTRODUCTORY COURSE 
Just which language shall be used as a try-out language is 
not easy to determine. There is much to be said in favor of
-P-A-G-E-172
  162 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
offering a general course of foreign languages in the seventh 
and eighth grades. Few pupils know whether it would be 
wisest for them to study Latin or German or French or Span- 
ish. A one-semester course respecting the territory, people, 
civilization, language, literature, and history of Rome, Ger- 
many, France, and Spain would have much merit. This 
does not, of course, mean that in a five months’ course, five 
weeks should be devoted to the study of each one of four lan- 
guages. What is advocated is a course about foreign lan- 
guages and the peoples who speak them rather than a course 
an several foreign languages. Such a course would teach 
facts concerning the geography, history, literature, beliefs, 
customs, and institutions of foreign nations as they appear 
in relation to the languages in question. The work should, 
for the most part, be conducted in English, with incidental 
use of foreign terms and expressions by way of illustration, 
and extensive use should be made of maps, pictures, charts, 
lantern slides, and blackboards. The aim of such a course 
would be to enable pupils to know the form of various lan- 
guages; the purpose and significance of foreign-language 
study in general; and what advantages each particular 
language possesses over other languages as a subject study. 
Furthermore, a course of this type might be expected to 
yield an appreciation of the culture and civilization of for- 
eign peoples — the chief, though often unrealized, end of 
more extensive foreign-language courses in senior high schools 
and colleges. 
A course of this kind is confessedly open to the criticism 
that it is not primarily a course in foreign language, but con- 
sists of historico-sociological material. That criticism, how- 
ever, holds true in regard to a large portion of the material 
which enters into nearly every course in foreign-language 
study in schools and colleges. The distinctive merit of a 
general course is its frank acknowledgment of emphasis
-P-A-G-E-173
  FOREIGN LANGUAGES 163 
upon content values rather than form values. The object 
of the course would, therefore, be realized, if pupils who pur- 
sued it were guided fittingly in electing formal courses in 
language study later in their school years. Moreover, to 
make a course of this kind at all profitable, it would be nec- 
essary to have the services of a highly cultivated teacher. 
The idea is not altogether a new one. It has its prototype 
in certain “‘appreciation courses’ to be found in several 
schools of the United States. It is advanced here, not as 
a recommendation, but as a plan for a promising experiment. 
The measurable results of its operation would either justify 
its retention or warrant its abandonment. 
In full accordance with the suggestions made by the author 
of this book for an introductory course in foreign language 
in the junior high school are the views of Dr. J. K. Van Den- 
burg, of the Speyer School, New York City. In The Junior 
High School Idea, Dr. Van Denburg shows how unsatisfactory 
have been the experiments at the Speyer School in respect 
to language instruction and asks if the first and most im- 
portant task is not that of “establishing an intellectual and 
emotional predisposition to like the work.’ He continues: ! 
If we accept this basis temporarily for our junior high school 
work, the first six months of any language study may well be spent 
upon a daily study of the people who speak the language, their 
home country, its history, and its geography. Its government, 
past and present, will be considered, though not too formally. 
Especially will its national heroes and heroines receive attention, 
as will its legends, myths, and superstitions. . .. All this pre- 
cedes any formal study of the language itself. .. . In our junior 
high schools the study of the language as a language will follow 
several months of this gradual social introduction.! 
The idea of an introductory course in foreign language has 
already taken firm root in some school systems of the United 
1 Op. cit., pages 151-152.
-P-A-G-E-174
  164 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
States. The following circular letter issued by the school 
authorities of Youngstown, Ohio, in 1921, shows what has 
been undertaken in that city: 
General Language Course 
The first course which the foreign language department offers 
is the General Language Course in the first semester of the 7th 
grade in the Junior High School. The fundamental principle 
which rules in the organization of the Junior High School courses is 
that “‘the course shall continue the integrating effect of education 
and also result in desirable gradual change into complete differen- 
tiation.”” This principle will be dominant in the organization of the 
General Language Course. It will be required of all pupils, and 
will confine itself to the fundamentals of language (not necessarily 
foreign language). However, in the work done in the course, for- 
eign languages as well as the vernacular will furnish materials, and 
this will enable the instructor to lead the pupil gradually toward 
succeeding differentiating courses in foreign language. 
Another guiding principle in Junior High School curriculum 
making is that the courses must be practical in themselves, acquaint 
pupils with possibilities of higher education, and make future elec- 
tion more intelligent. 
Therefore, we expect, first of all, that the course will be practically 
and immediately valuable in content. Foreign language courses 
particularly have been accused of doing much work at the beginning 
which is valuable only on condition that work be continued two or 
more years thereafter. This criticism is largely just. This first 
semester of work will be, therefore, complete, and valuable in itself. 
The pupil will build upon and continue his previous language work, 
working with some of the materials and methods of foreign language 
instruction. The work must be non-technical and the results 
immediately applicable. 
In this way, we expect that the General Language Course will 
codperate with the other early courses of the Junior High School 
in the work of discovering the varying aptitudes, capacities, and 
needs of the adolescent, making it possible for the student and his . 
adviser to decide intelligently as to the advisability of his entering 
differentiated foreign language courses which follow the General 
Language Course. For the organization and specific outcome of
-P-A-G-E-175
  
FOREIGN LANGUAGES 165 
this course, we shall quote from the Outline: “This course is 
designed to give to the students a general elementary idea of lan- 
guage as such, through the medium of comparison between the Eng- 
lish and foreign language, chiefly Latin. It is required of all 
students and will lead equally well to future work, in either English 
or foreign languages. ‘The course will be conducted largely as a 
laboratory course, with materials furnished by the teacher and 
pupils. The aims of this course specifically are: (1) to study the 
origin, growth, and influence of language in human history; how 
man began to use language, how he improved this tool, and how 
this wonderful tool in turn proved to be the greatest of all human 
forces in elevating man to his present position in the world; (2) to 
study words, their history, their prefixes and suffixes, etc.; (3) to 
develop a feeling for the significance of phrase, clause, and sentence 
structure, in the expression of thought; (4) to study such funda- 
mentals of grammar and syntax as will prove valuable tools for 
future language work, whether English or foreign, not by formal 
grammar study, but by experiment; (5) to discover such students 
as have capacity for advanced language study and to encourage 
them to continue this preparatory course by the study of foreign 
languages.” 
The outline then gives in greater detail suggestions of 
materials and methods used. Some of these are as follows: 
(a) Development of spoken language from grunt and growl of 
the first cave men to the highly developed modern languages. 
(6) Development of civilization from the most primitive family 
group to highly organized community life — emphasis 
constantly being directed toward the necessary development 
of language along with that of civilization. 
(c) Development of written language from earliest picture 
writing, hieroglyphics, cuneiform, Phoenician, Greek, Roman, 
to English, with a comparison with German, Hebrew, etc. 
(d) Spread of Roman control as it affected language. Greek 
colonies. 
(e) History of England with relation to language. 
(f) Sheets in hands of pupils containing : 
(1) Words with an interesting history. 
(2) Words adopted from various languages but considered 
English words.
-P-A-G-E-176
  166 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
(3) Words in common use from several languages compared ; 
e.g., father in Latin, Greek, Anglo-Saxon, French, 
Spanish, German, English. 
(4) Latin and French expressions in everyday life. 
(5) Latin mottoes and conversational French expressions. 
(6) Elementary Latin: simple sentence, short easy dia- 
logues. 
(g) English sentences and selections from good authors for the 
study of parts of speech and sentence structure. 
(hk) Most common Greek, Latin, Anglo-Saxon prefixes and 
suffixes. 
(7) Systematic dictionary study for parts of speech, substituting 
dictionary meaning in sentences, preferred pronunciation, 
derivation, synonyms, etc. 
Whether or not a general course in foreign-language study 
is introduced, it seems the part of wisdom to insist that for- 
eign-language study shall not be pursued by a pupil in lieu 
of the courses in English provided in the several grades of 
the school. Such a general course should be wholly supple- 
mentary to the English courses. The try-out or introduc- 
tory course about language might very properly be prescribed 
for all pupils. Beyond that one course, the work should be 
wholly elective. Moreover, there is little justification for 
holding to the rule that no credit will be given for language 
study unless two full years are devoted to it. A single- 
semester course, if properly organized and taught, should 
yield credit values for all pupils. To hold to a standard 
that demands two complete years’ work if the subject be 
elected at all, tends to discourage the cautious student from 
undertaking it and to encourage the inapt student to con- 
tinue his unprofitable efforts for the sake of insuring the 
little credit he has already conditionally earned. Persist- 
ence and perseverance are assuredly qualities that need to 
be cultivated in the schools. But there is no great educa- 
tional value in continued and continuing defeat. “Nothing
-P-A-G-E-177
  
  FOREIGN LANGUAGES 167 
succeeds like success”’ is a maxim made venerable by age; 
but the opposite statement is equally true, “Nothing fails 
like failure.’”” Educators need to appreciate this fact and, 
while not making the irregular transition from course to 
course an easy transition, they should be careful not to 
penalize too heavily the child who, for valid reasons, desires 
to make the change. 
THE PLACE OF LATIN IN THE FOREIGN-LANGUAGE COURSE 
Of the various special languages under consideration for 
the junior high school, Latin has, by all odds, the best claim 
to recognition. The reasons for this assertion are: 
(1) Latin is the mother of many of the modern European 
languages, and a knowledge of Latin helps pupils later 
to acquire these languages. 
(2) A large percentage of English words are derived from 
Latin, so that a knowledge of Latin contributes much 
to the comprehension and mastery of English. 
(3) Whatever values of formal discipline inhere in any 
language may be found in Latin, and to a greater 
extent than in most other languages. 
(4) Latin is prescribed for admission to many colleges, 
and in many colleges is accepted as satisfying the 
language requirement. 
(5) Latin is prescribed for admission to many profes- 
sional schools, such as those of medicine, dentistry, 
pharmacy, law, and theology. 
(6) Latin is prescribed by many state certificating boards 
which have to determine the educational and pro- 
fessional qualifications of candidates for licenses to 
practice various professions, among which are the 
pharmaceutical, dental, and medical professions. 
Professor J. B. Edmonson, Inspector of High Schools for 
the University of Michigan, in speaking particularly of the 
small high school (and the thought applies equally well to
-P-A-G-E-178
    168 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
the small junior high school) supports the primacy of Latin 
thus: 
I am glad to report that Latin is given a favorable place in the 
program of studies in the typical Michigan high school. The num- 
ber of students electing Latin is relatively large and is increasing in 
many of our schools. The talk, therefore, in some quarters that 
Latin is on the decline is not well founded when reference is made to 
the present conditions in Michigan high schools. 
I am especially interested in the place of Latin in the program of 
studies in the small high school. It is my opinion that Latin is the 
best foreign language for the small school to offer when the limita- 
tions on the program of studies are such as to force a choice. I base 
this opinion on the following facts: I find that Latin satisfies more 
of the occupational needs represented in the student body of the 
typical high school than does any other foreign language. For the 
student planning to enter college, the Latin satisfies the usual 
entrance requirement in the languages. For the student intending 
to specialize in English or a modern language, a knowledge of Latin 
is imperative. For the student expecting to enter the ministry, 
law, medicine, dentistry, or pharmacy, a certain minimum of Latin 
is usually a definite requirement. 
I very frequently tell boards of education that are interested in 
organizing a so-called practical program of studies that they must 
certainly give Latin a place because of its large prevocational or 
preprofessional value, and I have yet to find a board that has 
refused to admit the truth of this claim. 
I advise the choice of Latin in the small school for the further 
reason that well-trained teachers are easier to secure for Latin than 
for the other languages, and, in the end, the teacher is of more 
importance than the content of the course. I might also add that 
the unsolved problems for the small school of aim, method, and 
content are not so perplexing in Latin as in certain other studies.* 
AIMS AND METHODS IN THE TEACHING OF LATIN 
In stating the aims of Latin teaching, the Committee on 
Ancient Languages in Bulletin No. 41, 1913, declared : 
The following are some of the aims which seem worth while: 
to enrich the English vocabulary, both by the addition of new 
1“Tatin in Michigan High Schools,” Moderator Topics, page 83, 1920.
-P-A-G-E-179
  
FOREIGN LANGUAGES 169 
words and, particularly, by a more perfect mastery and clear 
understanding of many of the words already in use; to develop an 
appreciation of word, phrase, and clause relations; to teach clear- 
ness and accuracy of expression, both oral and written; to develop 
habits of industry and application; to make the pupil an intelligent 
critic of his own oral and written speech and that of others; to lay 
a good foundation for the study of English and of other modern 
languages; to read some of the great Latin masterpieces; to give 
a wider view of life through familiarity with a great civilization 
remote from the present, both in place and time, “‘in the cool, calm 
air of noncontemporaneous events.” ! 
Similarly, in giving advice respecting the choice of subject 
matter to be studied, the Committee says: 
The subjects for reading should be short and varied. Let us 
imitate our confréres of the modern languages, who do not make 
their pupils read dry military and political histories the second 
year or any other year, but offer bright, entertaining, and varied 
selections, which, while not too difficult, entertain and at the same 
time instruct. To students in the modern languages, grammar is 
the drudgery which is relieved by the reading of appropriate texts. 
To students of Latin the grammar is no less difficult, but the selec- 
tions for reading are so much harder than the grammar that the 
situation found in the modern languages is reversed. 
The text read, beginning with the simplest and easiest Latin, 
should, so far as possible, have an interesting and rich content. 
The fables and myths in the early period of study should be so 
selected that they would not only provide excellent training in 
reading Latin, but furnish as well a fund of legendary and mytho- 
logical lore which would be of great value in the understanding and 
appreciation of English literature. If properly taught, the interest 
in the reading matter would be so great and the relation of the 
grammatical work to that reading matter would be so direct and 
clear that an adequate motive for mastering the necessary techni- 
calities of grammar would be supplied. 
In this connection, the following extract from a letter ad- 
dressed to the author by Principal P. W. L. Cox, describing

the manner in which Latin is taught at the Ben Blewett 
Junior High School, St. Louis, Missouri, is of great interest : 
Our aim is to teach pupils to read Latin; i.e., to translate Latin 
into idiomatic English. 
With this aim always before us, we eliminate much of the formal 
grammar usually taught in the first year. We attempt as far as 
possible to teach all grammatical relations as they function in the 
reading. We reverse the order usually laid out in first-year books, 
of (1) forms, (2) model sentences, (3) rules, (4) exercises; and give 
(1) sentences, (2) forms, (3) rules. No model sentences are neces- 
sary. We teach no English-Latin sentences, because attention to 
these detracts from the accomplishment of our aim. 
Our actual procedure is as follows : 
For lack of suitable material we are compelled to use our first 
year text, Smith’s Latin Lessons, for about ten weeks, supplementing 
with stories in the Appendix and material printed in our school press. 
This takes us to page 40. We are now ready to study Latin as we 
believe it should be studied; i.e., from connected prose, graded to 
the ability of first-year pupils. For this we use Fabule Faciles. 
From this point, all our teaching is inductive. The pupils keep 
notebooks in which they record from dictation their vocabularies, 
classified, their rules of syntax, and their daily assignments. 
It is obvious that only a few words are chosen for intensive study 
in comparison with the large number used in reading. But these 
few form a nucleus for all drill on forms. We read many forms long 
before they are memorized. For example, the pupils translated 
fourth declension nouns before they could recite the declension. 
For rapid vocabulary work, we have all our words written on 
cardboard (about 3’’ & 8’’). On one side is the Latin word, 
on the other the English. These we use in reviews. 
We relate Latin to English use in every possible way. We have 
three wall charts made by the pupils: (1) Everyday Latin Ex- 
pressions, (2) A Lawyer’s Use of Latin, (3) Latin Mottoes on 
State Seals. The material was collected by the pupils. This adds 
interest in Latin as a vital subject. Other devices for vitalizing 
Latin are singing America in Latin; short dramatizations; and 
conversations. We make a great deal of English derivatives, 
especially in the beginning. Time spent on this is time gained. 
Every little while, we spend one whole lesson on such work. 
We make frequent use even in eighth grade classes of Harper’s
-P-A-G-E-181
  
FOREIGN LANGUAGES 171 
Latin Dictionary and Dictionary of Classical Antiquities. The 
latter we use to look up topics occurring in the reading, such as 
Delphic Oracle, Roman marriages, Vesta, etc. These are assigned 
to individual pupils for short reports to the class. This work is 
purely voluntary. 
There is a well-supported belief on the part of many classi- 
cal students and practical educators that any attempt to 
transplant the traditional beginning course in Latin into 
the junior high school is doomed to failure. Junior high 
school pupils are capable of learning Latin, but the greater 
number of those who can be persuaded to elect it require 
some other incentive than that of preparation for additional 
Latin or for college admission. 
Among the classicists who hold this belief is Dr. Mason 
D. Gray, Head of the Classical Department of the East 
High School, Rochester, N. Y. Dr. Gray has written sey- 
eral useful books relating to the subject. In his Introduc- 
tory Lessons in Latin and English, Part One, he states his 
position thus : 
In constructing a Latin course for the junior high school, our aim 
has not been to push the traditional high school course in Latin 
into the lower grades and thus merely to begin the study of Latin 
along traditional lines one year earlier. The new unfettered 
junior high school organization has created an exceptional opportu- 
nity, of which the utmost advantage has been taken, for reorganizing 
the course in beginring Latin on a distinctly socialized basis with 
the definite and determining object of making every element of the 
Latin course perform the largest possible direct service to the 
pupil... . 
In determining exactly what the legitimate goal of Latin in the 
junior high school is, the author has been guided by four cardinal 
principles. 
(1) In the first place, these introductory lessons are based upon 
the principle that Latin is not an end in itself, but a means to 
specific, definable, and attainable ends, involving direct service 
to the pupils who are studying it. By “Latin as an end in itself,”
-P-A-G-E-182
  172 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
I refer to that view which conceives the primary purpose of the 
study of Latin to be the acquisition and retention of the language 
as a language, for the sake of those remoter ends which are con- 
tingent upon such knowledge, such as the power to read and ap- 
preciate Latin literature. While this may be a legitimate goal for a 
very small percentage of those now studying Latin, it cannot be 
accepted as a primary justification for maintaining Latin in its 
present position as an essential element in the curriculum of our 
democratic secondary schools. If this is true, then — conversely — 
the legitimate ends of Latin study are those which can be realized 
part passu with progress in the subject and which continue to 
function after any capacity to read Latin has been lost. That the 
great majority (probably ninety-nine per cent) of the half-million 
pupils now studying Latin in our secondary schools will never learn 
to read Latin in any real sense of the term is an obvious fact too 
patent to require demonstration, and one that has supplied the 
enemies of the classics with the greater part of their ammunition. 
(2) The second cardinal principle is that whatever are deter- 
mined upon as the specific aims of Latin — practical, disciplinary, 
and cultural — should become forthwith the determining factors in 
the selection of material and the choice of methods, two problems 
that in Latin are not automatic in their action, but depend for their 
realization upon the conscious adaptation of the means to the ends 
desired. In this respect, comparatively little progress has been 
made. Our teaching of Latin today is, generally speaking, hardly 
less completely an expression of the traditional ideal of Latin as 
an end in itself than it was before that ideal was challenged. It is, 
in fact, a curious anomaly that, with the general recognition among 
secondary school teachers that the aims of Latin should be restated 
in terms of modern life with strict intellectual honesty, there has, 
nevertheless, been persistently associated an unshaken confidence 
that, somehow or other, whatever are stated as the aims of Latin 
are automatically secured through its study. . . . 
(3) The third controlling principle is that the work of any term 
should be determined, not by the needs of those who will continue 
the subject through the following year, but by the needs of those 
who will not go beyond the work of that term, a group that in many 
classes comprises approximately fifty per cent of the pupils. The 
present situation is precisely the reverse of this, and is the tangible 
expression of the college pressure which, however illegitimate it has 
 
-P-A-G-E-183
  
FOREIGN LANGUAGES 173 
come to be regarded theoretically, is still practically the dominant 
and controlling force in the teaching of secondary Latin. We 
believe that the course in Latin should be so organized that, while 
its cumulative capacity is fully recognized and maintained unim- 
paired, nevertheless, a week, a month, a term, or a year of Latin 
shall yield results in proportion to the time spent. 
(4) It follows that there should be in the mind of every teacher 
an explicit consciousness of the values inherent in Latin and that, 
so far as the developing powers of the pupils permit, they should also 
be made conscious of those values and of the relation of their specific 
tasks to the realization of those values. The pupils’ conception of 
the value of Latin should begin the first day on a concrete basis and 
should be gradually developed until it corresponds to the conception 
in the mind of the teacher. 
Again, Dr. Gray in his The Study of Words and Their 
Uses speaks thus: 
It is a curious anomaly that the writers of our textbooks appear 
to believe that the mere fact that Latin is the basis of English, as 
stated in their prefaces, will automatically insure the pupil’s using 
his Latin to interpret his English. They labor under no such de- 
lusion in presenting any other phase of the work. The pupil is 
confronted on every page with exact material to be mastered in 
vocabulary, syntax, and inflections. The teacher is not left to 
evolve these facts haphazard on the spur of the moment, nor is 
the pupil left to do something or nothing as he chooses. And yet 
in the more difficult problem of teaching the pupil to apply these 
facts elsewhere than in Latin, we make both of these mistakes. 
Material just as definite and just as scientifically selected as in 
inflection should be at the immediate disposal of the teacher, and 
the textbook should provide the pupil with material on which to 
work, just as definite as is the Latin vocabulary itself. 
The importance of a word in first-year work should be determined 
not solely by the frequency of its occurrence in Cesar, Cicero, and 
Vergil, which but a small percentage of the first-year pupils will 
read, but equally, if not more, by its occurrence in contemporary 
biology, algebra, and English. The scientific basis for such a 
selection is at present lacking. For amid all the doctors’ theses 
that cumber the shelves of classical libraries and amid all the 
specialized lexica that cover wall upon wall, there is available no
-P-A-G-E-184
  174. JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
  work that attempts to perform the eminently practical task of 
determining either what Latin words are most important for 
interpreting the language of modern life, literature, and science or 
what English words would, when their derivation was known, 
furnish the key to the largest and most important group of English 
words. Until these two problems have been solved, any work such 
as the present must be wholly tentative. 
Six of the faults connected with most Latin teaching of 
today are set forth by another classicist, Edwin L. Miller, 
Principal of the Northern High School, Detroit, Michigan. 
He says: 
(1) It is dull. 
(2) Teachers assume it has an impregnable place in the curricu- 
lum and hence do not sell it to their pupils. 
(3) Teachers assume that there is some mysterious virtue in 
making it so dry and distasteful that half their pupils drop the 
subject in disgust as soon as they have a chance. 
(4) The subject matter selected is not the fittest. 
(5) The writing of Latin prose is a fetish to the teachers and a 
- nightmare to the children. 
(6) Too much time is spent in teaching the quantity of vowels. 
Mr. Miller then raises the question of the material to be 
selected for study and says: 
Why cannot Latin teachers imitate English teachers, form a 
National Council of Teachers of Latin, hold a yearly convention, 
and find fit matter for their pupils to read? Is it because there is 
no fit matter? Is it because Latin teachers cannot translate any 
Latin except what they have studied in the teachers’ courses in 
college? Why insist that we must read only Latin of the Augustan 
age? ... One of the most engaging aspects of Latin study, the 
home life of the Romans, is now almost entirely neglected. Their 
ideals and observations are strangely modern. ... Probably 
no subject contains more of the real metal of citizenship than 
Latin. Yet itis a mine practically unworked. From Livy, Tacitus, 
Cicero, Pliny, Horace, Vergil, and the Latin Vulgate can be dug a 
1Qp. cit., pages 3 and 4.
-P-A-G-E-185
  FOREIGN LANGUAGES 175 
mass of social and political wisdom that is a great deal more up to 
date than most of the stuff... printed... in the Sunday 
papers... . Why not read Tacitus’s account of the Christians, 
Seneca’s prophecy of the discovery of America, the Animula Vagula 
Blandula, the Dies Ire, one or two scenes from Plautus and Terence, 
one or two poems of Catullus, several of Horace’s odes, the Gaudea- 
mus Igitur, and Professor Gayley’s Gloria Victoria ??} 
Why not, indeed? 
MODERN FOREIGN LANGUAGES 
As already stated, many practical and pedagogical consid- 
erations suggest that if but one foreign language is offered in 
the junior high school, that language may most profitably be 
Latin. If a modern foreign-language is offered, French (or 
possibly German) seems to be the most desirable one to in- 
clude. The two languages — Latin and the modern lan- 
guage — ought surely not to be begun by pupils simulta- 
neously. Nevertheless, it must not be forgotten that much 
of the value of foreign-language study is cumulative in its 
effect. That is, the longer it is studied effectively, the greater 
will be the proportionate returns to the individual. But 
when once a fair appreciative knowledge of any language is 
acquired, it is questionable whether it is worth while to pur- 
sue it further, wnless the individual proceeds sufficiently far 
in his studies to give him a real command of the subject. 
This command may be a reading, a speaking, a writing 
command, or it may be threefold. In view of the generally 
unsatisfactory results obtained when all three objectives are 
sought, it seems to be the part of wisdom to concentrate 
effort upon a reading command of the modern languages, 
and not strive to attain to a speaking or writing command. 
But in order to obtain any command of a language more

Topics, pages 572 et seq., 1920.
-P-A-G-E-186
176 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
than two years’ work is necessary, and beginning the mod- 
ern language in the seventh or eighth grade is one way of 
making prolonged study possible. 
The ideal which makes a reading knowledge of the modern 
foreign languages the primary goal in no wise denies the 
validity of the direct method. Sufficient data have not 
yet been collected to warrant a positive conclusion as to the 
worth of that method in giving a reading command of for- 
eign words. The common impression among many stu- 
dents is, however, that it does contribute greatly to the 
reading ability. 
The essential features of the direct method of foreign-lan- 
guage instruction are thus set forth in Bulletin No. 3, 19183, 
the United States Bureau of Education : 
The method, as its name indicates, plans to teach the foreign 
language by imitation, without much intervention on the part of the 
mother tongue. However, it also makes use of the analytical and 
synthetic methods to a great degree, in that the reading matter is 
thoroughly analyzed into its parts and construed, later to be recon- 
structed in original paraphrases. The direct method makes use of 
all that is valuable in the other methods, and thus may be con- 
sidered an eclectic method which is eminently adapted to our modern 
education with its varied demands. The tenets of the method, as 
they stand out both in theory and practice in the schools of Ger- 
many, are as follows, although, as stated above, not all German 
teachers have embraced the new method, nor do even all of the pro- 
gressives introduce the strict phonetic drill : 
(1) Phonetic drill is given in the elementary stages of the instruc- 
tion. 
(2) The foreign language is the medium of instruction. 
(3) Reading forms the center of instruction, but there are well- 
planned conversation lessons at each hour. 
(4) Grammar is taught inductively, in part or entirety. 
(5) The teaching of composition is limited to “free composition,” 
i.e., original writing on a set theme, or on the reading lesson, etc. 
(6) Translation into the mother tongue is limited to a mini- 
mum.

(8) Realien are used extensively. C 
CONCLUSION 
In conclusion, it can be said with a great deal of positive- 
ness (1) that foreign-language study has proved effective 
when offered in the seventh and eighth grades, provided the 
material and the teaching methods have been adapted to 
the capacities and interests of the pupils; (2) that some kind 
of general or introductory course seems to offer advantages 
as a first course in foreign-language study; and (3) that, of 
the specialized language courses, the course in Latin appears 
to have the first claim to recognition in the junior high 
school.

  CHAPTER ELEVEN 
Tue Sociat STUDIES 
HAT the social studies should become the core of the 
junior and senior high school curricula is an opinion 
that is being voiced by many educators, and put into prac- 
tice by many school administrators. Nor are justifications 
for the opinion difficult to find. More*and more the school 
is being recognized as a great national agency for the social- 
ization of individuals. To be socialized implies an adap- 
tation and adjustment of the individual to the group, a sur- 
render of a portion of one’s independence in order that each 
may profit the more by the combining of resources and pow- 
ers delegated to a common authority. To be socialized, 
therefore, is to. be humanized, to be possessed of group con- 
sciousness, and to exercise magnanimity toward all one’s 
associates and in all,one’s relationships. 
Now, from the earliest Gays, a study of man and his ac- 
tivities has always been held to .conttibute‘ to this end. 
Hence the subjects of history, literature, language, and phi- 
losophy have been given a prominent place 1 in every humanis- 
ticeurriculum. ‘But, so far as the secondary schools are con- 
cerned, the foremost rank among all of these studies has, 
in recent years, been occupiéd by nieerr: 
* TEACHING oF HISTORY AS THE FOREMOST SOCIAL STUDY 
There is pondé veason to think that in the amount, the 
“2 kimd, yand-the 4rrangement of the work, the teaching of 
history has*not been organized tothe best advantage. Cer- 
tain it is that/ the social results obtained have not been en- 
tirely satisfactory.. Neither has historical interest among 
boys and girls been so keen as might be wished. 
In part, the faults which are responsible for these defi-

“ 
ciencies are three: (1) the lack of any systematic instruction 
in history other than American in the elementary school; 
(2) the encyclopedic nature of the history work offered in the 
seventh and eighth grades; (3) the difficulties incident to 
the course in ancient history in the ninth grade. 
In regard to the third point, it may be said that boys 
and girls of twelve and fourteen years of age have so shallow 
a literary, social, and political background that only rarely 
is it possible to arouse in them a vital interest in ancient 
history. "The events described are so remote in point of 
time, the treatment of the topics is frequently so needlessly 
detailed and formal, and the articulation of ideas with pres- 
ent-day affairs is often so loosely made, that the work be- 
comes little more than a jumble of words. What is needed 
is a simpler and more concrete approach to the various spe- 
cialized courses in history than the one that is commonly of- 
fered at present. Moreover, at its best, history is a dead 
subject ; ; it deals with events that happened long ago; it 
is usually written in the past tense. Young students, how- 
ever, are chiefly concerned with the present and the immediate 
future. They are looking forward, and not back. They do 
not interpret life by means of ancient historical events but 
read its meaning largely in the circumstances of the peer 
day. 
This does not mean that history may not be made to ap- 
pear alive and real to children and young people,.nor that, 
pupils who are wisely instructed may not be intensely inter- 
ested in the events of the past. Evidence in support of this 
contention is everywhere to be found. Children-tike  noth- 
ing better than a good story well told — and a story is ysu- 
ally written in the past tense. Moreover, sinee all the hu- 
man institutions of the present strike their roots more or less 
deeply into the past, a clear comprehension of the signifi- 
cance, organization, purpose, and operation of these institu-
-P-A-G-E-190
180 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
tions can be obtained only by a study of the forces of which 
they are the resultants. Therefore, whoever believes in 
the theory of social evolution must accord an important 
place in our system of education to the study of history. 
DESIRABILITY OF A NEW COURSE IN CITIZENSHIP 
But the training for effective citizenship cannot stop with 
the acquisition of a fund of historical information, nor with 
a mere interest in the past. Citizenship is called upon to 
deal with social situations as they exist today and as they 
will arise tomorrow. Hence, courses in history must be 
supplemented by courses of study dealing with current 
events, current social theories, current social problems, and 
current human relationships of many sorts. Nor will it 
suffice to allow these matters to remain merely interesting 
bits of knowledge for pupils. The knowledge must be made 
to operate in the lives of the boys and girls more or less 
immediately and to establish in them desirable social atti- 
tudes. In other words, the inculcated historical and social 
impressions must be transformed into guiding principles of 
conduct. 
To attain to these ends, a new division of social science 
ought, it would seem, to be added to the curriculum. This 
new course should deal systematically with current social 
questions and practices. It should contain elements of 
geography, civics, sociology, economics, political science, 
vocational activities, avocational interests, current events, and 
other matters of human interest. Let the course be called 
Citizenship, Sociology, Social Science, or whatever name seems 
most appropriate ; but let it be provided as a separate course, 
related to the courses in history, yet not a dependent part of 
them, and coédrdinate with all other departmental divisions of 
the program of studies. Just as, in colleges and universities, 
the courses in political science, sociology, economics, and

geography, because of their expansion and refinements, have 
been set off from the courses in history, so it would seem 
that the time has arrived for like procedure in the secondary 
schools. 
Thus, the work that has commonly been designated social 
sciences in the high school might be arranged with appro- 
priate additions in two parallel types of courses. 
That a course of this kind seems on the way to formation 
is indicated in the report of J. M. Glass, Director of Junior 
High Schools in the State of Pennsylvania. He says: 
In time, the term, “general social science,” will be used as exten- 
sively as are today the terms “general science” and “general mathe- 
matics.”” The exploratory and preview values of this course will be 
coextensive with the whole junior high school period. Such a 
course will provide an apperceptive basis for advanced courses in the 
cross-sections of world history, economics, political science, and 
sociology. The discovery of interest and capacity is as probable 
in the field of social science as in the field of natural science. Further- 
more, the discovery and stimulation of interest and capacity for 
social science are vital to the fields of public and social service.! 
Numerous approximations to the spirit of the plan out- 
lined above have already been made in many secondary 
schools, if indeed the form itself, in its essential character- 
istics, has not been approved and adopted. The primary 
element in the social sciences is the time element, an element 
which, in the very nature of the case, can only with diffi- 
culty be comprehended by immature persons. It follows, 
therefore, that the values derivable from a study of the so- 
cial sciences are cumulative values and that the work should 
extend over a relatively long period of time. It is for this 
reason that definite attention to humanistic questions should 
be given to pupils from the earliest grades in the school. 
Doubtless little systematic textbook study can be expected 
1 Circular, Pennsylvania, 1922.
-P-A-G-E-193
  THE SOCIAL STUDIES 183 
before the end of the sixth grade, but during the first six 
years much incidental social knowledge can be imparted. 
Beginning with the junior high school, this knowledge should 
be extended and utilized in a way that will serve definitely 
in interpreting life in a complex democracy. To this end, 
it seems wise that during the first half of the sev- 
enth grade the course in history should deal with the lives 
of world-renowned heroes and heroines. It is probably true 
that biographical studies as an agency for revealing the great 
revolutionizing, social forces that have been operating in 
world history since its beginning must necessarily be deferred 
to a somewhat later period. At twelve or thirteen years 
of age, however, pupils have reached the stage when they 
are intensely interested in human beings not only as human 
beings, but also as authors and interpreters of social pro- 
cesses. Here, then, is a time in which historical studies cen- 
tering upon notable men and women can have a strong in- 
fluence. Moreover, unless pupils of this age are given an 
opportunity to become acquainted with the more significant 
human movements of the entire past, many of them, because 
of withdrawal from school, will never learn of these move- 
ments in any systematic way. Within the course, biographi- 
cal studies like the following, correlated with their social 
events, might well be included: Khufu, Nebuchadnezzar, 
Solomon, Cyrus the Great, Xerxes, Confucius, Lycurgus, 
Pericles and the Golden Age of Greece, Cincinnatus, Hanni- 
bal, Pompey, Julius Cesar, Augustus Cesar, Alaric, St. Ben- 
edict, Mohammed, Charles the Great, Alfred the Great, 
William the Conqueror, Robert Bruce, Joan of Arc, Fred- 
erick Barbarossa, Peter the Hermit, Lorenzo dei Medici, 
Marco Polo, Martin Luther, Queen Elizabeth, Philip II of 
Spain, William the Silent, Mary, Queen of Scots, Gustavus 
Adolphus, Cromwell, Marie Antoinette, Napoleon, and 
Bismarck.
-P-A-G-E-194
    184 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
The importance of the study of, history in a civilization 
like ours and the disfavor in which the subject is at pres- 
ent held by many pupils in the schools give warrant for a 
certain amount of experimentation in the teaching of this 
subject. Wherever courses similar to the one advocated 
here have been provided many favorable results have 
been obtained, as witness, for example, the work in Berkeley, 
California. 
That an elementary but systematic study of the European 
influences which affected colonial history in America is de- 
sirable before taking up the more detailed story of the de- 
velopment of the United States seems substantiated both 
by reason and by the experience of practical educators. 
Undoubtedly, too, the prolongation of the elementary course 
in United States history throughout the entire eighth grade 
has its justifications. The work, however, should not be 
too formalized and it should not be left uncorrelated with 
either geography or the current interests of today. 
As Professor James Harvey Robinson has recently said 
in a public lecture, history serves its chief function as an 
extension of the memory, enabling one to bring to bear upon 
a contemporary situation much interpretative knowledge. 
- Hence the facts of history ought to be selected with refer- 
ence to their probable service in assisting pupils to under- 
stand better the institutional and social world of today and 
tomorrow. 
INDICATIONS OF THE DEMAND FOR TRAINING IN 
CITIZENSHIP 
How general is the public demand that the schools shall 
provide more direct and specific training for citizenship can 
be judged from the discussions that are occurring on all 
sides. 
The National Association of High School Principals, through
-P-A-G-E-195
  
THE SOCIAL STUDIES 185 
the report of its Committee on Social Studies, made in 
February, 1920, gave its unanimous approval to the following 
principles : 
More time should be devoted than is now the case to social studies 
other than history. In accomplishing this, social studies should be 
brought into competition not alone with history. It should be the 
explicit understanding that the importance of social studies is to 
be magnified at the expense of English, mathematics, languages, and 
even the natural sciences. . . . In order to detach the time factor 
from all other problems it should, we believe, be asserted that social 
studies, including economic, social, and civic topics drawn from pres- 
ent-day life, should be given a place in every student’s curriculum 
in every year in the junior and senior high schools. 
Of similar tenor is the following, taken from the Second 
Annual Report of the Committee of the American Socio- 
logical Society on the Teaching of Sociology in Elemen- 
tary and High Schools: 
This concept, usual in the minds of teachers [i.e., the nature of the 
ninth-grade Community Civics course] is much too narrow. Un- 
fortunately the social institution that all but monopolizes their 
attention is the government. ‘True, they are not content to study 
its mere forms, as they were some years ago. They do give some 
attention to the everyday interests of life with which the government 
concerns itself. But what they teach is still civics, nevertheless — 
not general social science. ‘Teachers, as a rule, do not yet perceive 
that government is only one in the sisterhood of social institutions, 
and not the most important at that; that a “socius” is more than a 
citizen, having many other social interests, activities, and relations 
besides the civic. 
From your committee’s extensive correspondence with sociologists 
it is quite as clear that they have a much broader concept of what 
should be taught in the ninth grade. It is the consensus of their 
opinions that this still too narrow “community civics” should now be 
definitely abandoned in favor of general social science. The adop- 
tion of this name is itself desirable for several reasons, but chiefly 
to suggest to the rising generation that there is a real science of

society. The course should definitely include sociology, economics, 
civics, and ethics, although it goes without saying that for peda- 
gogical reasons the material should be elementary, concrete, and 
descriptive, and that the four subjects should be “‘fused,”’ after the 
analogy of general science and unified mathematics as they are now 
taught in the ninth grade of most progressive schools. 
The sociology in this course should be chiefly a local study of the 
fundamental social groups and institutions; namely, the family, 
the play group, the neighborhood associations, the school, the church, 
recreation, etc. In the field of economics, it should make the pupil 
familiar with the chief vocations, industries, and industrial institu- 
tions of his immediate environment. In the field of civics, it should 
acquaint him with the local civic machinery and teach him how to 
use it. But while the point of departure in all these fields should be 
the local environment, the study should not stop there, but should be 
supplemented with a nation-wide description of social, economic, and 
political phenomena, with the relations of local phenomena thereto. 
And while the study should be chiefly concrete, it should not fail to 
proceed from the concrete to the abstract in so far as general principles 
can be assimilated by early adolescents. And throughout the whole 
the ethical import of sociological, economic, and civic relations should 
be incidentally but insistently suggested. The course should de- 
velop the concept of codperation, and reveal the raison d’étre for the 
essential ideals and virtues of life, while the most approved pedago- 
gical devices should be used for motivating and emotionalizing the 
same.! 
Likewise the geographers have joined in the common cry 
for reform. At a recent meeting of the Central Association 
of Teachers of Science and Mathematics, the Committee on 
Earth Sciences (Geography) reported, in part, as follows: 
Pupils of the first-year high school are in a trying stage of their 
lives. They are neither children nor adults. They love romance 
and adventure. Their imaginations can be put to work on real 
people in real situations in a way that will give them quite as much 
pleasure as thrilling tales of adventure that are pure fiction. These 
children are more interested in people than in anything else. They 
delight in hearing about strange folk who live a long way off. In

imagination they reconstruct and vivify the picture described in the 
printed page. Geography, so treated, quite as much as. history, 
broadens their outlook on life, keeps them from being too provincial, 
too snobbish, too ungenerous to people who are different and, to 
their manner of thinking, therefore inferior. If it could be brought 
home to them that they and their friends, if put under exactly the 
same circumstances, would act much as these curious foreign people 
do, they, a few years hence, might bring a better understanding to 
our problem of the assimilation of alien people.! 
That geography as a socializing subject has had its values 
inexcusably ignored by most of our schools can scarcely be 
denied by any one who takes the trouble to analyze the facts. 
This mistake must not be perpetuated. Professor R. H. 
Whitbeck of the University of Wisconsin has summarized 
the importance in this wise: 
In the training of citizens for a democracy, there are four lines of 
study that go hand in hand in making broad-minded citizens — eco- 
nomics, history, political science, and geography. I am not speaking 
of physical geography or of commercial geography alone. I am 
thinking of geography in its broad sense, but particularly of politico- 
economic geography, the kind of geography that makes men well 
informed about the nations of the world, which makes them intelli- 
gent about other peoples, about their aptitudes, their forms of gov- 
ernment, their social institutions, their national likes and dislikes, 
their military and moral strength, their reserves of coal, iron, copper, 
and petroleum, the character of their transportation systems. I can- 
not escape the conviction that education which does this for our 
young men and women is one kind of education that our nation in 
this age demands. It is training for citizenship in the broadest sense 
of the word, not only for performing the duties of a citizen at home, 
but for guiding safely the nation in its international relations. . . . 
There is no man or woman who participates actively in the affairs of 
the community who would not value a thoroughgoing knowledge of 
geography of his own country and of other countries. It forms a 
background for intelligent action, it enables people to read more in- 
telligently, to converse and to write and to think more intelligently.?

188 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
More recently, 1922, the Association of Collegiate Schools 
of Business has proposed a program of social studies for the 
junior high school and has formulated its principles as fol- 
lows: 
(1) The organization of social studies in the public schools should 
be in terms of the purpose of introducing those studies. 
Their purpose is that of giving our youth an awareness of what 
it means to live together in organized society, an appreciation 
of how we do live together, and an understanding of the con- 
ditions precedent to living together well, to the end that our 
youth may develop those ideals, abilities, and tendencies to 
act which are essential to effective participation in our society. 
(2) This Commission believes that the social studies should be the 
backbone of secondary education, with which all other studies 
and school activities should be closely articulated. 
(3) The social studies should be directed toward an understanding 
of the physiology rather than pathology of social living. 
(4) Any program of social studies that hopes to be successful must 
be drawn with consideration for vocational needs (and)... 
with recognition of the great losses of our student constituency 
in certain years. 
(5) Social studies should be presented in the junior high school 
without too much regard for traditional claims or customary 
practices. 
(6) An effective program of social studies will be organized in 
terms of the psychology of learning. 
Accordingly the program suggested passes (1) from a seventh- 
grade discussion of types of social organization and some condition- 
ing factors of the types, (2) through an eighth-grade survey of the 
development and practices of our modern social organization, (3) to 
a ninth-grade discussion of principles of social organization.! 
The Commission then outlines its proposed course for the 
junior high school as follows : 
SEVENTH GRADE 
(1) Geographic bases of (physical environment with relation to) 
United States development. 
1 Social Studies in Secondary Schools, pages 49-52.
-P-A-G-E-199
  
  
  THE SOCIAL STUDIES 189 
(2) Social science survey (types of social organization). 
(a) Simple industry and simple society. 
(b) The transforming effects of scientific knowledge. 
(3) Other studies, correlated so far as may be practicable with the 
social study material. 
EIGHTH GRADE 
(1) The opening of the world to the use of man. 
(2) Vocational survey, the individual’s place in our social organiza- 
tion (presented in functional terms so that it may contribute to 
an understanding of our type of social organization). 
(3) Other studies, correlated so far as may be practicable with 
the social study material. 
NINTH GRADE 
(1) The history of the United States (presented with “ citizenship 
material ” occupying the center of attention). 
(2) Principles of social organization (economic, political, social). 
(3) Other studies, correlated so far as may be practicable with the 
social study material. 
(4) A general survey of business administration, elective.! 
Respecting the faulty organization of the material ac- 
tually offered in the schools, Dr. H. O. Rugg, with whom the 
present writer heartily agrees, says: 
Are the reading materials of history, civics, and geography full 
enough in historical background so that children can live over the 
experiences which are demanded for a real understanding of the 
important features of present life? . . . A careful analysis of our 
textbooks leaves no room for doubt as to the answer to our in- 
quiry. Textbooks do not furnish enough detail to give students a 
real depth of feeling and comprehension for the matters under con- 
sideration. . . . Social science textbooks are veritable encyclopedias. 
. . . They are reference books. They devote half a page to this 
and ten lines to that. . . . What is needed in place of the brief and 
isolated paragraphs we now give children to read is a wealth of 
anecdote, narration, and description about a few worth-while matters.?

  190 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
How some of the schools are meeting their problems in 
respect to the social sciences and citizenship may be seen 
from the following quotations taken from recent courses of 
study. 
The authorities in Berkeley, California, express them- 
selves thus: 
In the previous grades, the method of teaching is designed prima- 
rily to cultivate a love for history and to foster the habit of reading. 
Stories of great men and great deeds arouse the child’s ambition and 
help to create ideals. The method of teaching in the seventh, 
eighth, and ninth grades should aim to strengthen this interest, 
build upon it, and use it to train the pupil to a more systematic pur- 
suit of knowledge. He should learn how to study, that is, to read 
intelligently and to form conclusions — to formulate ideas, not 
merely to memorize words. He should learn to solve simple 
problems and so form the habit of meeting social and _ political 
problems fairly, and of analyzing them, as every citizen should be 
able to do. 
A well-kept notebook may be made to contribute much toward 
establishing habits of neatness, order, and straight thinking. Since 
clear thinking depends largely on ability to visualize, the teacher 
should encourage the use of every available means, such as outlines, 
maps, diagrams, models, pictures, dramatization, etc. In this 
formative period, much can be done also to establish habits of accu- 
racy and thoroughness. 
The fundamental purpose in these grades is not so much to impart 
information as to cultivate high ideals, to develop right habits of 
thought and of study, to inculcate a sense of civic responsibility, and 
to furnish a perspective from which the pupil may see the history of 
his own nation as merely a part of the history of the human race. 
Nevertheless, certain important facts that are necessary to this 
perspective, as well as the fundamental facts of American History, 
should be learned thoroughly.! 
Belleville, Illinois, gives advice to its teachers in this wise : 
In geography, the best results can be obtained only when the 
child realizes that what he is working on is of use to him. The boy 
will be interested in geography and will work hard to master it when

THE SOCIAL STUDIES 191 
he feels that it helps him daily to understand things. Be sure to 
bring up daily and to locate on maps the places that are mentioned 
in the newspapers of the previous day. This habit once formed will 
amply repay the children for the effort expended. ‘They will thereby 
easily learn the location of many places in two years, and it will 
also aid greatly in vitalizing the work. 
Much of the history found in our textbooks never functions in 
the lives of our citizens. There are entirely too many unimportant 
events briefly and disconnectedly outlined. What we need is to em- 
phasize the important events, making them big and rich in content 
and connected up with American life of today, so that they will 
function in good citizenship. This is the history that will interest 
the pupil and consequently remain with him to aid him as voter 
and citizen to reach the right conclusions on the many questions of 
politics and government that are constantly confronting him. 
In discussing battles in the wars we have engaged in, it matters 
little when or where the engagements occurred, or who the generals 
were, or how many men were engaged. Throw the emphasis on the 
spirit or state of mind or the cause for which they were fighting, and 
finally on the effects of the battle on the troops, on the home people, 
and on our antagonists. 
The primary aim of this course (community civics) is to arouse in 
the pupils of the school an interest in, and a knowledge of, the duties 
they and all the rest of us owe our city, state, and nation. The ac- 
complishment of this high ideal will require genuine patriotic and 
community-loving spirit on the part of the teacher, and a wise han- 
dling of the pupils and the material. If we can get the children to 
feel that they can be of vital use in the betterment of the community 
and the welfare of the state and nation, we have struck a respon- 
sive chord in them which will greatly aid in our task. Here are a 
few ways in which they can be of great aid: 
By obeying the law in regard to non-molestation of property; by 
respecting the sacredness of the rights of others; by holding city 
ordinances inviolable; by keeping clean morally, physically, and 
spiritually; by enjoying life, but avoiding cruelty and over-in- 
dulgence; by attending school regularly; by agitating and taking 
part in all community work that is for its good or that of our country. 
The schoolroom work can be greatly enriched and made interesting 
by class, group, and individual visitation and inquiry at the various 
city, county, and state offices; such as that of Health, Water, City

Engineering, Garbage, Street, Overseer of the Poor, Market and 
Weightmaster, Superintendent of Highways, County Superintendent 
of Schools, Public Library, Fire, Police, County Clerk, City Clerk, 
Treasurers, Mayor, Sheriff, State’s Attorney, Recorder of Deeds, 
Custodian of the St. Clair County Historical Museum, and all of the 
courts, from the lowest to the highest ; also the Board of Supervisors, 
the different civic clubs, and public-spirited citizens. 
The result of these visits and investigations can be further vitalized 
by organizing the class for the time being into a city council, electric 
light company, a hospital board, or any other organization to suit 
the needs of the studies just previously made. 
Interest is further aroused by taking up in class daily, for 5 or 
10 minutes, the current events pertaining to public welfare, not only 
of our own community, but that of the State and of the nation.! 
At the Ben Blewett Junior High School, St. Louis, Mis- 
souri, social study is, to quote Professor R. L. Lyman, 
. . . the primary subject required continuously throughout the 
entire course for five periods a week. Moreover, art, music, and 
certain other allotment subjects, even English itself, the only other 
continuous five-hour subject, are in Blewett considered as directly 
contributing to the social training which is thus prominent in the 
curriculum and is in marked evidence in all of the social activities of 
the school. A visitor is struck by the frequency with which there 
appear in many classrooms discussions of group obligations, demo- 
cratic duties, and social responsibilities of the school life itself. 
Social studies in the seventh grade correlate history and geography 
and consist of four series of ten projects each, one project weekly per 
quarter, under four major problems: (1) First quarter : the origin of 
American History as found in the civilization around the Mediter- 
ranean before 1500 a.p. . . . (2) Second quarter: struggle for free- 
dom and empire from 1492 to 1620. . . . (8) Third quarter: world 
affairs between 1620 and 1763 as influenced by the desire for political 
and economic freedom, for wealth and economic independence, and 
for commercial and political empire. (4) Fourth quarter: the war 
of American independence, its causes and beginnings, its relation 
to the sea power of England, and its importance as one of the great 
events of history.

  THE SOCIAL STUDIES 193 
Social science in the eighth grade proceeds purely upon the topical 
basis in American history as a story and interpretation of our democ- 
racy, quite openly discarding chronological sequence, ... The 
ninth grade organizes its community civics in the first half year on 
the basis of Dunn’s Community Infe, and its second half-year course 
in the vocations on the background of Gowan and Wheatly’s 
Occupations.* 
How Massachusetts is proceeding in the subject of citi- 
zenship is revealed in the following account given by F. M. 
Davenport : 
Both boys and girls in Massachusetts are beginning to be guided 
toward a broader and more useful community citizenship. At 
Chatham in groups together they hunt and destroy the larvee of the 
brown-tailed moth. At Dorchester the teacher, as judge of a circuit 
court, conducts his pupils through all the naturalization proceedings, 
and when the time of the final oath of citizenship comes they stand 
up and take it together while the teacher-judge reads from Hale’s 
Man Without a Country or from President Wilson’s speech to the 
new Americans in Philadelphia. Dorchester is through with teach- 
ing citizenship from a textbook and of having it written back to the 
instructor. Government is objectified. When the senior class elects 
its officers, it is done in a regulation polling-booth under the system 
of the preferential ballot. . . . 
In Massachusetts some of the most successful teachers are trying 
to make the school-city a model for the municipality. The pupils 
under such instructors elect their own mayor and common council 
at the time when the city’s mayor and common council are elected. 
They follow with ordinance and discussion the policies and activities 
of the city government. There are very few important factors of 
the real city’s life with which these community experimenters do not 
become in a measure practically acquainted. ‘There goes fifty cents 
of my money,” said one boy to another as the fire-engine swept by 
the window. It is the serious, practical side of the duty of citizenship 
which is brought home to them. And when the time is ripe for it, 
these native New England scions and the offspring of the foreign 
stock together take the young Athenian’s oath :

“We will never bring disgrace to this our city by any act of dis- 
honesty or cowardice or ever desert our suffering comrades in the 
ranks. We will fight unceasingly to quicken a public sense of civic 
duty. We will revere and obey the city’s laws, and do our best to 
incite a like respect and reverence in those about us who are prone 
to annul them or set them at naught. ‘Thus in all these ways we will 
transmit this our city, not only not less, but greater, better, and more 
beautiful than it was transmitted to us.”’!

CHAPTER TWELVE 
MATHEMATICS 
UST what place mathematics is to hold in the stand- 
ardized junior high school is a question of surmise. 
Just what form it will assume is a matter of still greater spec- 
ulation. Notwithstanding the attacks of enemies, the sub- 
ject has as yet held a rather firm hold, and is doubtless des- 
tined so to do for all time to come. As Professor David 
Eugene Smith says: 
It is related positively to almost every branch of human activity, 
whether chiefly mental or chiefly manual, and, even considered on 
the lowest educational level, it is bound to maintain a position of 
importance. With arithmetic intimately related to every com- 
mercial and industrial interest; with the algebraic formula in every 
type of industrial manual, even in books in domestic science; with 
geometric forms and measurements required in every walk in life; 
and with the slide rule in the pockets of thousands of artisans, 
mathematics will hold its place without any regard to the mental 
discipline which it was recently the fashion to proclaim as forever 
laid to rest.! 
“Now,” continues Professor Smith, “if mathematics is 
to be taught in grades seven, eight, and nine, what shall be 
its nature ?”’ 
Answering his own query, Professor Smith says: 
In the first place, it seems certain that a goodly amount of 
arithmetic must always be offered. ... Since intuitional and 
constructive geometry is more concrete than algebra, it seems 
evident that this should find place in grade seven, with such algebraic 
formulas as are needed in its study. Since an elementary type of 
algebra is today necessary even in ordinary reading, this may 
properly be emphasized in grade eight, and since the door of real 
mathematical thinking should be open to every boy and girl... 
the work of grade nine may properly include a half year of formal

algebra followed by a half year of formal geometry, or else a whole 
year of algebra as at present. 
Professor Smith further believes that the bases of arith- 
metic in the seventh grade should be “occupational rather 
than logical’ and should progressively consider the arith- 
metic of the home, the store, the farm, industry, the bank, 
and soon. The geometry of the seventh grade should con- 
sist of “intuitive geometry of shape (including construc- 
tions), of size, and of position.” In the eighth grade, alge- 
bra, geometry, and arithmetic should support and interpret 
each other. 
In greater detail, the National Committee on Mathemati- 
cal Requirements, in its preliminary report (1919), expressed 
similar conclusions. It said, in part: 
Stated by topics rather than years, the mathematics of the junior 
high school may properly be expected to include the following : 
(A) Arithmetic 
(a) The fundamental operations 
(6) Tables of weights and measures in general practical use 
(c) Emphasis on simple fractions: 3, 4, 2, ¢, $, 4, } 
(d) Facility and accuracy in the four fundamental operations 
(e) Very simple short cuts in multiplication and division 
(f) Percentage 
(g) Line, bar, and circle graphs 
(hk) Arithmetic of the home: household accounts, thrift, 
simple bookkeeping, methods of sending money, parcel 
post 
Arithmetic of the community: property and _ personal 
insurance 
Arithmetic of banking: savings accounts, checking 
accounts, foreign money 
(B) Intuitive Geometry 
(a) The direct measurement of distances and angles by means 
of a linear scale and protractor

attempt to limit the number of fundamental assumptions, the sole 
purpose being to show to the pupil what ‘‘ demonstration’ means.!

The Committee then offered the five plans given below as 
suggestive of the ways in which the work might be distrib- 
uted, but recommended none as superior to the others. 
Plan A 
First year: Applications of arithmetic, particularly in such lines 
as relate to the home, to industry, to thrift, and to the various 
school subjects; intuitive geometry 
Second year: Algebra; applied arithmetic, particularly in 
such lines as relate to the commercial, industrial, and social 
needs of our country 
Third year: Algebra, trigonometry, demonstrative geometry 
By this plan the demonstrative geometry is introduced in 
the third year and arithmetic is practically completed in the 
second year. 
Plan B 
First year: Applied arithmetic (as in Plan A); intuitive 
geometry 
Second year: Algebra, intuitive geometry, trigonometry 
Third year: Applied arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry, 
demonstrative geometry 
By this plan trigonometry is taken up in two years, and the 
arithmetic is transferred from the second year to the third 
year. 
Plan C 
First year: Applied arithmetic (as in Plan A); intuitive 
geometry; algebra 
Second year: Algebra; intuitive geometry 
Third year: Trigonometry; demonstrative geometry; applied 
arithmetic 
By this plan algebra is confined chiefly to the first two years. 
Plan D 
First year: Applied arithmetic (as in Plan A); intuitive 
geometry 
Second year: Intuitive geometry; algebra 
Third year: Algebra; trigonometry; applied arithmetic 
By this plan demonstrative geometry is omitted entirely.
-P-A-G-E-209
  
  MATHEMATICS 199 
Plan E 
First year: Intuitive geometry; simple formulas; elementary 
principles of statistics; arithmetic (as in Plan A) 
Second year: Intuitive geometry; algebra 
Third year: Intuitive geometry; numerical trigonometry; 
arithmetic 
By this plan the work of the first two and one half years may 
be described as general mathematics, while the last half 
year would be devoted to the special civic and economic fea- 
tures of business practice. 
That undue stress has been placed, in the past, upon 
arithmetic in the seventh and eighth grades is today rarely 
denied by even the most enthusiastic defenders of mathe- 
matics as a school subject. That the simpler processes 
of algebra and the less complex portions of geometry can 
readily be comprehended by the typical boy or girl of the 
seventh and eighth grades is a contention which experiment 
is everywhere proving valid. That, on the other hand, the 
more formal aspects of algebra should constitute a prescribed 
course for all pupils in the ninth grade is, to a large extent, 
being denied by practical educators. Hence a revised plan 
of mathematical “instruction is almost everywhere being 
sought to take the place of the traditional course of arith- 
metic in the seventh and eighth grades. 
For some time now, leaders among mathematicians have 
been advocating a course in general or introductory mathe- 
matics for the junior high school. Conspicuous among these 
reformers is E. R. Breslich of the School of Education, 
University of Chicago. In an article in the School Review 
for May, 1920, Mr. Breslich expresses himself relative to 
the problem in this wise: 
Assuming that our interpretation of the junior high school 
period is correct, and that this is a period of experience-getting, this 
experience should extend over the whole field of elementary mathe- 
matics, arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and even trigonometry.
-P-A-G-E-210
200 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
These subjects are not to be taught separately, at least not during 
the first two years. What is wanted is a wide experience with the 
mathematical concepts which the pupil builds into a growing 
structure. All of these subjects contain simple facts which can 
easily be mastered by the twelve-year-old pupil. Geometry is 
experience-getting in space relations; algebra, in abstract quantity 
relations. Experience gained in either should be used whenever it 
can be made helpful in the study of the other. When mathematics 
is taught essentially as one subject, it is possible to keep the im- 
portant principles as far as possible under review, thus increasing 
the power of retention. Algebra is not to be taught as an organized 
science and the “‘sacred sequence”’ of Euclid in geometry will have 
to be abandoned. 
Algebra taught as an organized science is to a pupil of this age 
nothing but a mechanical juggling of symbols, a wearisome iteration 
of meaningless manipulation, a waste of his time which stunts his 
intellectual growth. . . . [But] giving a pupil wide experiences 
with these fundamentals [of all mathematics] will make possible a 
gradual and easy approach to the parts of the subject that are 
later taught in the high school. 
Such material should be selected as proves its worth by actual serv- 
ice in the life of the pupil and such facts should be included as the 
pupil needs in his other studies. The material is to be arranged as 
far as possible in psychological order. New terms are to be learned 
through use and as need for them arises and the work progresses. 
At present there is a relatively excessive amount of time given to 
arithmetic, which contains much that is unessential or fundamen- 
tally beyond the pupils’ experience. Such topics as stocks and 
bonds, exchange, compound interest, partial payment are things 
that are foreign to the pupil at this age and are seldom touched upon 
in future courses. They may well be transferred to the upper 
classes of the high school, where they should be made elective for 
those who are interested in commercial work. 
We have said that the junior high school period is a time of 
experience-getting. Hence the arithmetic studied should relate to 
things of real interest to the pupil. It should be subsidiary to larger 
occupational interests. It should be arithmetic of the store, the 
farm, and industry. It should deal with matters of the home, such 
as planning family expense accounts on a certain income, saving to 
buy a lot on an installment plan, incomes from boys’ activities.
-P-A-G-E-211
  MATHEMATICS 201 
The algebra of the junior high school should be the outcome of 
concrete problems. The formulas should be related to real things. 
Formulas taken from the shop, the trade journals, engineering 
pocket books can be made interesting. Formulas may be used to 
show the advantage of the algebraic method over the arithmetical 
method in problems of percentage, discount, and interest. The 
equation, which is the core of the course, is a tool for problem-solving. 
There is to be no symbol juggling. The rules, principles, and pro- 
cesses are rationalized. The operations are a means for solving 
equations and are introduced as needed. 
Geometry will furnish an abundance of concrete material. It 
should be used freely to make clear abstract algebraic principles 
which otherwise remain hazy. Many theorems, such as the theorem 
of Pythagoras, are essentially numerical relations. They furnish 
formulas for algebraic solution and lend themselves easily to alge- 
braic treatment. 
Graphical representation is to be used freely. To avoid an 
unnecessary accumulation of difficulties, positive and negative 
numbers are to be studied after the operations with positive literal 
numbers have been mastered. Much unnecessary material should 
be omitted.! 
Experience seems to be bearing out Mr. Breslich’s main 
convictions. 
The recently issued outlines of the State Department of 
Public Instruction of Pennsylvania recommend a course in 
general mathematics for all junior high schools and explain 
the recommendation thus: 
General mathematics reveals the branches of higher mathematics 
in their simpler aspects and at the same time provides a background 
of experience in determining aptitude for higher mathematics and 
an apperceptive basis for the later cross-sections of mathematics. 
General mathematics includes a gradually decreasing amount of 
arithmetic, decreasing from maximum to minimum, and a gradually 
increasing amount of secondary mathematics, increasing from 
minimum to maximum. General mathematics is a reorganized 
self-contained course of study, but, as a resultant, it preserves 
articulation with elementary and secondary mathematics, Thus 
1 Breslich, E. R., Junior High School Mathematics, pages 368 et seq.
-P-A-G-E-212
202 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
it prevents abruptness of transition with the courses of mathematics 
in either the elementary school or the senior high school. It pro- 
vides an opportunity to evaluate aptitude for higher mathematics ; 
it becomes the source of an apperceptive basis for all branches of 
secondary mathematics; and by preserving life contacts in all 
phases of its development it offers an actual educational return to 
the junior high school drop-outs who will not profit from either its 
exploratory or its preview values. 
Despite the advice of educational leaders, many schools 
in different parts of the country are not following, un- 
modified, the suggestions. Some have adopted the plan of a 
general mathematics course only to abandon it. Others 
have begun algebra and geometry in the seventh and eighth 
grades and have been dissatisfied with the result. It seems 
clear that much of the trouble experienced with the newer 
theories is due to faulty methods of organizing and giving 
instruction in the several courses. ‘The following statement 
taken from a personal letter written by Superintendent 
J. W. Sexton of Lansing, Michigan, February 27, 1922, 
gives the views of a practical administrator. Mr. Sexton 
says: 
We are now operating on a tentative course of study which 
runs as follows in mathematics : 
7th year — Elements of algebra throughout the year. 
8th year — Inventional and constructional geometry throughout 
the year. 
9th year — Arithmetic throughout the year with special em- 
phasis on the commercial side. The other phases of 
arithmetic have been covered in the previous years’ 
work. 
One of the great difficulties that people are having with junior 
high school work is that they think of it in terms of high school 
credit. Seventh-grade algebra is not the same as the old ninth- 
grade algebra used to be. The children are two years younger. 
They have had two years less of arithmetic and are not able to do 
what we used to consider under the old régime a year’s work.
-P-A-G-E-213
MATHEMATICS 203 
What is true of seventh-grade algebra is true of seventh-grade Latin 
and all the other subjects. Czsesar or tenth-grade Latin has been 
impossible for many children. If by studying Latin three years, 
— seventh, eighth, and ninth grades in junior high school, — the 
pupils come to the tenth-grade prepared to do Cesar with some 
degree of ease, pleasure, and fluency, I think the time will be well 
spent. It is Latin we are after and not credit. 
We placed algebra in the seventh grade for two reasons: first, 
the simple elements of algebra are easier than the kind of arithmetic 
formerly given in the seventh and eighth grades; second, the 
children have had formal arithmetic for about four years, so we 
thought a new branch of mathematics would be more interesting to 
them than to continue the study of arithmetic. We do no demon- 
strating in the geometry of the eighth grade. This makes rather a 
new subject for the pupils in the eighth grade. Having had these 
two years of work, we think they are now ready to do a good thor- 
ough year’s work in arithmetic, so we have placed arithmetic in the 
ninth grade. 
How certain other representative schools are meeting the 
mathematics question may be seen from a consideration of 
various syllabi and outlines of courses. 
The following excerpt indicates what are the practices 
in the junior high schools of Rochester, New York: 
Arithmetic is continued throughout the year (eighth grade) 
largely in its relation to the new subjects, geometry and algebra. 
The first half of the year provides for the consideration, in a thor- 
oughly concrete and simple setting, of the fundamental facts of 
plane geometry by means of a study of straight lines, angles, 
triangles, polygons, and circles. This study is followed by the 
introduction of the ideas of equality, of symmetry, congruence, 
and similarity. Such simple ideas and principles of solid geometry 
as are desirable in giving the preparation for algebra and for a 
subsequent study of pure or applied mathematics are also introduced 
as a part of this course. The students are also given some oppor- 
tunity to gain skill in the use of geometrical instruments; and, by 
means of ample use of concrete materials in tre schoolroom, on the 
street, and at their homes, they are constantlp led to see the relation

of things all about them to the study of geometry and to desire 
reasons for geometrical processes. 
The second half of the eighth year is devoted to the study of 
algebra. As geometry was developed much earlier, historically, 
than algebra, it has seemed wise to use it as a means of furnishing 
background for the latter study. Under this plan, algebra is re- 
garded as a short method of symbolizing numerical relations and 
processes; and, in order to give meaning to symbols before the 
actual study of algebra is attempted, geometry has been selected as 
furnishing an easy field for this application of algebraic symbols. 
While this is by no means the only field of such application, it has 
proved a most natural one under the present arrangement. The 
subject matter for this semester includes only so much of algebra 
as can be readily assimilated and easily applied in the concrete 
manner suggested above. The equation occurs early in the course 
and is supplemented by numerous simple problems. The entire 
plan provides for the introduction of algebraic symbols in a much 
more simple and concrete manner than is ordinarily attempted, 
thus leading naturally to the fundamental definitions, processes, 
and principles of the new subject.! 
The following is the outline of the mathematics course 
in the Ben Blewett Junior High School, St. Louis, Missouri: 
GENERAL STATEMENT OF CouRSE oF Stupy IN MATHEMATICS OF

We use the Standardized Tests to diagnose the children’s mathe-

Short daily drills are given on the fundamental processes and on

The solution of problems of everyday life such as personal 
accounts and bills. Just enough arithmetic of the farm to enable 
the child to understand something of the importance of the industry 
on which he is so dependent. 
Problems of industry and the bank. All of this work is taught 
with the idea of enabling the child to understand (i.e., interpret)

- the world in which he lives, and to understand the quantitative side 
of that world; not for the sake of solving so many examples in 
order to obtain correct answers. Stress is placed on rationalization 
of problems, not on habituation. 
The three methods of solution of problems — namely, the table, 
the equation, and the graph—are taught. The children are 
taught to use the graph solution wherever it is possible, and in the 
most convenient form, either bar, circular, or line graph. 
They are taught the use of arithmetical signs to enable them 
to express problems in the equational form, and to solve them. 
The formula is taught in connection with interest problems and 
with the simple geometry of space as taught at the end of this grade. 
Some constructive geometry (or geometry of form) is given. 
Then geometry of location, and finally geometry of size or mensura- 
tion. Here we make use of the formula and the equation, which 
pave the way so well for algebra. 
Every possible effort is made to vitalize the work by making it 
deal with the problems of the child’s everyday life. 
EIGHTH GRADE 
Arithmetic of transportation and travel. Familiarize pupil with 
money order, foreign money, express rates, postage, etc. 
Arithmetic of the bank. Interest and simple discount, savings 
and checking accounts. Writing of checks and notes. 
Mensuration, application of square root. Right triangle. 
Stocks and bonds. Corporations: no drill work on this subject. 
A study of stocks and bonds with the idea of giving pupils a 
knowledge of their functions, their necessity in business, and their 
value as investments. 
A study of market reports, ete. 
In all work, stress formula and equation. 
Algebra: formulas, simple equations, fundamental processes 
with integers and negative numbers. 
Commercial class in eighth grade follow same course, stressing 
banking and commercial problems. If necessary, omit mensura- 
tion. 
NINTH GRADE 
The approach to algebra has already been made in the eighth 
grade; therefore the pupil is more or less familiar with simple 
equations of the first degree, formula, graph, etc.
-P-A-G-E-216
  206 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
The ninth grade work carries the pupil through equations of one 
and two unknowns, simple, fractional, and quadratic equations. 
Enough factoring is given to handle the equations successfully. 
Some work in fractions is given to enable the pupil to handle the 
equation and the formula. 
An attempt is made to broaden the work of the ninth grade mathe- 
matics by introducing concrete applications, such as logarithms, 
solution of right triangle by tangent of the angle, drawing to scale, 
etc. 
The work of the ninth grade is not designed to find a direct 
application in the business world, but to develop mathematical 
concepts, and to give at the same time enough skill as a preparation 
for later courses in mathematics. 
SHOP MATHEMATICS OF THE NINTH GRADE 
This course is now being developed, and it is not yet clear just 
what it is going to be. The basic idea is to put the pupil into con- 
tact with such situations in the shop — or situations of a technical 
nature — as are within his comprehension, that are quantitative 
in character, and to enable him to meet these situations. The 
problem that confronts the shop foreman, for instance, so to select 
the pulleys transmitting the power to a lathe that the material in 
his lathe may be cut at the most advantageous speed, is a type of 
this situation. In general, most of the mathematics in connection 
with the lathe is possible. Such geometrical considerations as are 
necessary for the solution of these problems or for the understanding 
of the “why” of such geometrical constructions as he meets in his 
mechanical drawing will be taken up. Also as much algebra as is 
necessary to understand and manipulate formulas given in shop 
manuals intended for the use of the foreman or the workman of the 
better type —in short, for men whose training along technical 
lines is practical rather than theoretical. The trigonometry of the 
right triangle will be necessary for this purpose, but practically no 
formal geometry. In algebra, the following will be necessary : 
ordinary substitution in order to evaluate formulas; the four funda- 
mental processes with monomials; integral and fractional equations 
of the first degree — in general with monomial denominations only ; 
such knowledge of fractions as is necessary for the solution of equa- 
tion mentioned above; a working knowledge of logarithms in con- 
nection with the solution of right triangles is also desirable. Deci-
-P-A-G-E-217
MATHEMATICS 207 
mal fractions are to be reviewed, as well as the conversion of com- 
mon fractions to decimals. 
Time will show what may with advantage be omitted from, or 
added to this tentative outline.! 
The following is, in part, the outline of a proposed course 
in mathematics for junior high school, prepared by a commit- 
tee of teachers in Kansas City, Kansas: 
The course of study here presented is offered as a working basis 
toward the development of a socialized mathematical program which 
will meet the needs of the boys and girls of the junior high 
school... . 
In the first year, business procedures of the home, school, and 
community which develop the arithmetic facts related to percentage 
and its applications — profit, loss, commercial discount, commission, 
taxes, and interest — comprise the main part of the year’s work. 
These business procedures are grouped under the topics of informa- 
tional problems, and thrift and economy in budget-making, buying 
and selling, savings, and paying debts. ‘This is followed by work 
in mensuration with respect to such linear measurements, areas, 
and volumes as are common to the child’s experiences. Special 
emphasis is placed upon banking. ‘The eighth or second year’s 
work is a continuation of the study of business practices in situa- 
tions which involve more judgment on the part of the child. The 
situations are grouped under the topics of credit, protection, city 
expenses, and investments. Besides reviewing previously learned 
arithmetic facts, this develops facts related to debit and credit, 
bank discount, drafts, insurance, taxes, stocks, bonds, building 
and loan. After this, many of the mathematical facts are reviewed 
by means of tables, graphs, formulas, and algebraic equations 
at the same time that the arithmetic facts related to square root, 
ratio, and proportion are developed. Unified mathematics in the 
last year acquaints the child with geometric facts, simple algebraic 
equations of one or’ more unknowns, and quadratic equations. 
Throughout the course there are such reviews and drills as are 
essential for efficiency. Information concerning the origin, the his- 
tory, and the why of business transactions enriches the course. . . . 
Such subjects as have no utility in common life will be omitted 
or postponed until the senior high school. The arithmetic topics 
- 1 Circular of information issued by Principal P. W. L. Cox.
-P-A-G-E-218
  208 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
which have been omitted from this course are those which educators 
and business men have recognized as serving no practical end in 
everyday life. Some of these omitted topics are essential to certain 
vocations, but a senior high school education is a requirement of 
those vocations. It is best to give to all those things that all need, 
and put those things that only a few need in the course that the few 
will follow. 
. . . Buying and selling at a profit or loss, at a discount, or on a 
commission, savings, and paying debts touch the lives of all the 
children as do the measuring of parallelograms, triangles, circles, 
prisms, and cylinders. It is because of this that these topics are 
placed in the first year of the course. .. . 
The home, school, and community supply the material for this 
course. The children collect data and information which are utilized 
in the classroom. The children also collect the problems which 
members of their families have had to solve during a certain period 
of time. Factory payrolls, marked-down sales, advertisements, 
cook books, general hardware, merchandise, and furniture catalogs, 
and interests of the community are searched for material. Other 
departments furnish problem data and problems which arise in their 
courses. The teacher, through reading and interviews with city 
officials and business men, makes herself thoroughly acquainted 
with the information which the course gives and supplements 
that which the'child brings in. The problems do not use the same 
objects repeatedly. The material is presented in settings that are 
in harmony with existing conditions. The problems have a counter- 
part in real life. . . . 
In concluding this chapter, it is fitting to refer to the mathe- 
matics course of the Lincoln School of Teachers College, 
Columbia University. This school is perhaps the most 
notable experimental school of teaching methods that the 
country has. Speaking of the work in mathematics pro- 
vided therein, Dr. Raleigh Schorling writes thus in the bul- 
letin of the school : 
The history of mathematics shows that the science developed in a 
very simple and natural way. Man lived a happier and a richer 
life when he had learned to measure and to count. In all ages 
quantitative thinking and expression have been interwoven with
-P-A-G-E-219
  
MATHEMATICS 209 
human experience. The power to think in terms of space and 
number has not ceased to be important; indeed, it appears to 
become more necessary as life grows more complex. 
In somewhat the same simple way that the race developed the 
early aspects of the science the pupil may be given a meaningful 
insight on an experiential basis. The simple principles are best 
learned in situations where the need for them is felt, and the more 
complex principles, where greater economy and power are demanded. 
. . . It is our aim to acquaint the pupils with numerous con- 
crete situations requiring that some element of the material world 
be quantitatively analyzed and manipulated. 
. . . As far as concerns mathematics, what facts should the well- 
informed man know? What specific mathematical abilities need 
to be developed? What powers of appreciation need to be culti- 
vated? In short, what is the minimum amount of information and 
training that society may well expect of high school graduates? 
The work which we are now giving to our Junior High School grades 
represents the beginning of a course which purposes to answer these 
questions. We have probably only scratched the surface of the 
possibilities. Our achievements are not the measures of our desires 
to improve the mathematics situation. 
It may be observed that this introductory course involves a de- 
parture from customary mathematical aims and results. As they 
are usually formulated, the pupil is confidently expected to gain 
from mathematics unusual power, possibly even in remote fields, as, 
for example, preaching a good sermon, manipulating the bond mar- 
ket, or winning a legal battle. So long as teachers of mathematics 
accept this vague promise, an “apartment house” fraction or a 
complicated factoring problem, which no one has occasion to know, 
not even in the study of higher mathematics, constitutes valid sub- 
ject matter. Faith in the peculiar disciplinary powers of mathe- 
matics caused instruction in this subject in America to be charac- 
terized by formalism. In algebra this formalism led to undue 
emphasis on the manipulation of symbolism, whereas in geometry 
it took the form of forcing philosophic criticism upon immature 
minds. 
In current practice valuable time is wasted on non-essentials to 
the exclusion of worthwhile material. In general, the pupils are 
not happy in mathematics courses, in spite of the fact that number 
relations constitute one of the fundamental interests of the human
-P-A-G-E-220
  210 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
mind. Parents resent the large number of failures and well they 
may, for it is my understanding — certainly my experience — that 
the pupil who cannot learn mathematics, properly organized and 
presented, and who, at the same time does not lie very low on the 
curve of general intelligence, is an individual so scarce as to be diffi- 
cult to find. Teachers of college freshmen, too, are dissatisfied. 
They marvel that incoming students can sometimes do the prob- 
lems involving the manipulation of symbols with greater facility 
than their instructors, in spite of the little understanding of the 
simple fundamental principles of the subject. 
While mathematics may not be the worst offender in this matter 
of formalism, it nevertheless furnished an excellent illustration of the 
need of the particular kind of reorganization which brought the 
Lincoln School into existence.!

  CHAPTER THIRTEEN 
NATURAL SCIENCE 
ATURAL science as a subject of study in the junior 
high school has recently received enthusiastic sup- 
port. There are two reasons for this support. One is prac- 
ticaland social; the other is pedagogical. The first is founded 
upon a clear recognition of the fact that tens of thousands 
of pupils are closing their school careers at the age of four- 
teen, fifteen, or sixteen, without entering high school at all. 
For them, the wonders of science will never be revealed — 
and this, in the most remarkable scientific era that the world 
has ever known and at a time when, in countless ways, sci- 
ence is entering into the daily life of every individual. 
The second reason for the recent recognition of the im- 
portance of science in the junior high school curriculum is 
the generally accepted judgment of psychology and peda- 
gogy (1) that the beginning courses in any subject should 
concern themselves with the large fundamental aspects of 
the whole field of related ideas rather than with detailed 
specialized portions of the subject; (2) that the approach 
to a new field is best made through an inductive study of 
familiar, simple topics rather than by means of a deductive, 
abstract treatment of principles; and (3) that the early 
years of adolescence are the appropriate ones in which to 
begin the systematic study of nature and of natural laws. 
These considerations have led to the advocacy of a course 
in general science for the junior high school. The questions, 
however, that still remain unanswered are: When shall the 
course begin? What shall be the length of it? How many 
periods per week shall be devoted to it? What shall be its 
content ? 
211
-P-A-G-E-222
  212 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
In seeking answers to these various questions, one encoun- 
ters much confusion of thought. But notwithstanding con- 
flicting views, order is emerging from the confusion. In a 
recent bulletin,! the Commission on the Reorganization of 
Secondary Education recommends that a course designated 
General Science, including hygiene, be offered in the “seventh 
or eighth year, five periods a week; or both years with three 
periods a week each year,” and that, in the ninth year, a 
course dealing with Biological Science, including hygiene be 
offered, such a course to consist of “general biology, botany, 
or zoiblogy.”’ 
Continuing, this report, speaking of general science in 
particular, says: 
The subject matter of general science should be selected to a 
large extent from the environment. It will therefore vary greatly 
in different communities. The science involved in normal human 
activities, and especially the science involved in the reconstruction 
period after the war, presents many real problems which must be 
met more intelligently than formerly if there is to be the needed 
increase in effectiveness of the service which individuals and groups 
are expected to give. Science is universal and constant in the life 
of our citizens, and hence to be useful to all pupils general science 
must accept the science of common things as its legitimate field. 
The science of common use and that of the classroom should be the 
same. General science should use any phase of any special science 
which is pertinent in the citizen’s interpretation of a worth-while 
problem. 
The particular units of study should be those that truly interest 
the pupils. Interest not only secures productive attention but is an 
evidence of attention. To be substantial educationally, interest 
must rest upon a sense of value, an evident worthwhileness in the 
topics considered. 
No topic should be selected which is meager in content or lacking 
in significant problems. The range of material which can be used 
is in reality limited only by the capacity, experiences, and needs of 
1 Reorganization of Science in Secondary Schools, Bulletin No. 26, page 23, 
Bureau of Education, 1920. 
 
-P-A-G-E-223
    NATURAL SCIENCE 213 
the pupils. The materials should be concrete and capable of lead- 
ing to many avenues of new and untried experiences. . . . 
The foregoing discussion of selection and organization suggests 
the point of view in presentation. Topics should be large units. 
At the outset the topic should be viewed briefly as a whole, for the 
sake of perspective. Such a general view gives a concrete and 
significant basis to which there should be constant return and to 
which further and more detailed and more exact studies should be 
constantly related. 
A combination of class presentations of out-of-school experiences, 
of individual laboratory work, and of teacher-and-pupil demon- 
strations is desirable. Simple materials should constitute most of 
the laboratory apparatus. The desk demonstration by teacher or 
pupils is excellent as a means of presenting an experiment for obser- 
vation and discussion so that the attention of all may be definitely 
directed to the question in mind. Pupil demonstrations and 
individual laboratory work also should be used, since they give 
individual opportunity to handle apparatus and opportunities for 
active participation by each pupil. There is no objection to the 
same problem being solved by the whole class as individuals or as 
groups, provided that the class as a whole feels the importance of 
the work; but care must be taken when assigning the task to all 
to see that the work does not become meaningless for some. Sixty- 
minute laboratory periods are generally better than longer periods 
for introductory science courses. An abundance of textbook and | 
other reading matter should be available. 
No text in general science can or should supply answers to all 
inquiries. ‘The textbook should be used as a reading and reference 
book, and other sources for reading should be extensively used, 
such as magazine articles which deal with current use of science. 
References should be specific for children of the age of general 
science pupils, since they will gladly do much reading if they know 
just what to read. 
Bulletins of available current reading matter prepared by teachers 
and pupils are an aid in reference work, and are stimulating to 
teacher and pupil. 
Excursions, well directed and with a purposeful plan, are of great 
value. Excursions should always be definitely planned, carried 
out as serious exercises, and the results used in later work. Pupils 
and teacher should look upon excursions as a regular part of the 
serious work of the course.
-P-A-G-E-224
  214 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
The Commission on the Reorganization of Science, in treat- 
ing of the place of biology in the ninth grade, calls particular 
attention to the weaknesses inherent in the typical course 
of former years. Among these weaknesses were the over- 
specialized training of teachers, the over-formal nature of 
the laboratory work, and the selection of topics that appeal 
“to the adult mind rather than to the mind of the adoles- 
cent.” “The material used was often remote from the every- 
day experience of the student, and biological studies . . . 
failed to function. ... When teachers began to present 
biology in its relation to human welfare, a new and vital 
interest in the subject was awakened.” The Commission 
then sets forth the aims of the biology course as follows: 
Biological sciences, in common with the other sciences in second- 
ary schools, should contribute to the educational objectives 
stated on page 12 — health, worthy home membership, vocation, 
citizenship, the worthy use of leisure, and ethical character. In 
particular, biological sciences should have the following specific 
aims : 
(1) The World War has emphasized health as a basic end of educa- 
tion. Since much of biology deals directly with problems 
of health, the course in biology must accept efficient health 
instruction as one of its chief and specific ends. 
(2) The biological sciences should develop the pupil’s purposeful 
interest in the life of the environment by giving a first-hand 
acquaintance with plant and animal neighbors. 
(3) They should emphasize some of the most important applica- 
tions of biological science to human activities and to general 
and individual human welfare, and especially should familiar- 
ize the pupil with the structure and functions of his own 
body, to the end that he may know why he must live health- 
fully in order to live happily and usefully. 
(4) They should train the pupil to observe life phenomena 
accurately and to form logical conclusions through the 
solution of problems and through projects essential tothe 
productive work of agriculture, gardening, etc. 
(5) They should enrich the life of the pupil through the esthetic 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
  (6)   
NATURAL SCIENCE 215 
appeal of plants and animals studied, to the end that he may 
appreciate and enjoy nature. 
They should demonstrate to the pupil the value of intensive 
study of biological science as a means through which scien- 
tific progress is attained. In view of what science has meant 
to our present-day civilization and in view of the measure 
in which the methods and results of scientific investigation 
are today reflected in intelligent thought and intelligent 
action, the need of the life sciences in the education of modern 
citizens cannot be ignored. 
As to the content of a general biology course, the Report 
says: 
The Committee believes that a course in biology in the ninth or 
tenth year should be what the name implies — a study of living 
things. 
(1) 
(2) 
(3) 
(4) The central ideas should be: 
The way in which each organism maintains its own life and 
the life of the species. 
The interrelations between different organisms and groups 
of organisms. 
The constant dependence and interrelations of living things 
with the physical world about them. 
The power of man to control the habits and relationships of 
plants and animals to serve his own ends. 
The Report then offers specific suggestions relative to the 
content and concludes its outline thus: 
The culmination of this study should be an increased interest 
in personal hygiene and sanitation. A good opportunity is open 
to biology teachers who have the right point of view in giving much 
help regarding the biology of sex. ... This important subject 
should not be presented to high school pupils from its pathological 
aspects. ... The whole success of the movement depends on 
well-trained, sympathetic teachers well endowed with common 
sense. Important, however, as is the teaching of the facts and the 
hygiene of reproduction, a knowledge of these alone does not insure 
boys and girls against bad practices. ... To the knowledge of 
what is right must be added the will to do the right. Hence, the 
Committee believes that all physiological instruction relative to
-P-A-G-E-226
  216 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
sex should be supplemented and strengthened by sane appeals to 
the ethical and religious nature of boys and girls. 
What place does physiology occupy in the scheme of 
things? While it is true that many schools still provide 
course instruction in physiology in the seventh and eighth 
grades, it is obvious from an examination of the literature 
pertaining to the junior high school that physiology as a 
separate and distinct subject is not receiving the attention 
in those grades that it formerly did. Not that its values 
are diminished or less clearly recognized, but that the sim- 
pler portions of the subject can adequately be treated in 
the grades below those of the junior high school, that the 
practical facts of the subject can best be taught in connection 
with courses in physical education and biology, and that the 
more complex topics of structure, form, and function right- 
fully belong to more advanced courses than those which 
can be legitimately provided for in the junior high school. 
Certainly a valid criticism directed against much of the teach- 
ing of physiology in the past has been its verbalism and for- 
malism. If, as seems probable, a rearrangement of the 
work will minimize this fault and make the instruction vital 
for boys and girls, nothing will be lost and much will be 
gained. 
There seems to be good reason for advocating a study of 
nature even before the systematic course in general science 
is begun. Ex-President Eliot of Harvard University has 
for years preached the need for more sense training. So 
have others. Nevertheless, only occasionally in the schools 
is any well-organized plan for training of this description 
to be found. A fully reorganized plan for giving instruction 
relating to nature and nature’s processes will include definite 
allotments for work throughout all of the elementary grades. 
Systematizing and summarizing the information gained 
from such studies and connecting such information with
-P-A-G-E-227
  NATURAL SCIENCE 217 
the instruction in general science, a course in the natural 
history of animals and plants in the first half of the seventh 
grade would seem to have much merit. 
The writer recalls with satisfaction the avidity with which 
he as a boy pored over the pages of Buffon’s Natural His- 
tory, and the lasting impressions that were made upon him. 
The life stories of animals, birds, fishes, reptiles, and insects 
have great interest for most boys and girls. To read ac- 
counts of the life habits and antics of these dumb friends and 
enemies, and to supplement the readings with photographs, 
stereopticon and motion pictures, exhibitions of real speci- 
mens, and actual visits to menageries, conservatories, aqua- 
riums, and parks will contribute much to the interest in science 
and the power to discover and interpret Nature’s laws. 
A plan of this kind would, if put into effect, give a curric- 
ulum scheme of the following order : 
Grade 1-6. Nature Study 
Grade 7B. Natural History 
Grade 7A-8A. General Science, with Hygiene 
Grade 9. General Biology 
That the views of many other individuals respecting 
general science courses are in close agreement with what 
has been suggested above may be seen from the following 
excerpts. 
First, a part of the report made by a committee of the 
High School Masters Club of Massachusetts in 1917: 
The committee feels that the work in general science is of great 
importance and is worthy of the best thought of those responsible 
for the details of the courses in this subject in the junior high 
school. Despite the great advance that has been made in the 
general science courses as given in the past in the high schools of 
the country, much constructive work yet needs to be done. The 
work has been criticized as a hodge-podge which ill deserves the 
name of science. Too often the training or personal interest of
-P-A-G-E-228
  218 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
the teacher, or of the writer of the textbook, has led to an undue 
emphasis on some special field. of science. The course in general 
science ought to concern itself with an orderly and rational study 
of the pupils’ environment. In this study the principles of the 
physical sciences are of primary importance because these principles 
are fundamental to all sciences. The pupil ought to study the 
phenomena of everyday life, that he may understand them and 
apply the principles involved to new experiences. Such a study 
will bring a real gain in power, and with even fair skill on the 
part of the teacher can hardly fail to arouse genuine interest. 
In order to avoid misunderstanding, the committee would make it 
clear that it is not recommending simply a course of diluted physics 
and chemistry, but a new subject — the study of environment in its 
scientific aspects. ‘The necessary limitations of this report make 
it impossible to enter into details, but two fields of great human 
interest which have hitherto generally been neglected in courses in 
general science may well receive some attention. Some of the im- 
portant facts of meteorology are well within the grasp of pupils of 
junior high school age, and the phenomena of weather are not only 
of perennial interest to the average citizen but the underlying prin- 
ciples of these phenomena are closely connected with other matters 
which always receive attention in courses in general science. Prob- 
ably no other part of our environment lends itself more readily 
to the project method of study. The other suggestion is that some 
attention be given to the study of microdrganisms. These have 
come to figure so largely in modern life that we cannot afford to 
ignore them entirely even in an elementary course. 
Second, from an article by Miss Alice Jean Patterson on 
“Methods of Science Teaching in the Junior High School”’ : 
There is a choice between two rather distinct modes of attack. 
One is the organized-science method, the other is the nature-study 
method. The former needs little explanation. It is the method 
that has been employed for years in the teaching of the special 
science in high schools and colleges. The subject matter is grouped 
around fundamental principles and Jaws. The pupils are started 
at once along a path of well-organized material which usually pro- 
gresses step by step from the simple to the complex. The nature- 
study method deals directly with unorganized materia]. It means 
hand-to-hand contact with objects and phenomena in the environ- 
 
-P-A-G-E-229
  NATURAL SCIENCE 219 
ment of the children. The material is studied in its natural setting, 
that is, the laboratory includes not alone a room equipped for that 
purpose, but the out of doors as well as various processes found in 
the home, the school, the shop, the factory, and the street. It 
means that the children observe, and question, investigate and 
interpret, experiment and undertake definite projects in the solu- 
tion of their problems. 
Plant study means making the acquaintance of individual 
plants found in the community. ‘These may be cultivated plants of 
garden, field, and orchard, or uncultivated ones of the woods and 
roadsides. Entire plants are observed. ‘Their habits of growth are 
studied, special characteristics are discovered. Problems that 
arise with the observation or the project are, when possible, answered 
by further investigation or by experiment. If the plants are 
cultivated ones their values to the community and to the outside 
world is studied, as well as the history of their amelioration and the 
part they have played in the advancement of human society. 
If the plants studied are uncultivated ones, weeds, for example, 
the pupils go to the gardens and fields of the neighborhood or their 
own garden plots for their material. They study the habits of 
growth of these pests, work out the life cycle, note methods of seed 
distribution and other special characteristics that enable the plants 
to withstand hard conditions. To aid in identification and to fix 
characteristics, specimens are collected, mounted, and preserved for 
future use. Projects to determine methods of combating are 
undertaken. 
Animal life is taken up in a similar manner. Insects encountered 
in the garden, field, or home are observed, their relation to plants 
and to each other noted, their life histories worked out, their habits 
of feeding, of passing the winter, investigated, and their economic 
relation to the community studied. 
The same fundamental principles are employed in the study of 
physical and chemical phenomena. To illustrate: the study of 
heat and heating is not begun in the laboratory by experiments and 
a discussion of facts gathered from the textbook, but with the prob- 
lem of how the schoolroom and the homes are heated. The work 
begins with an investigation of the heat supply of the room, air 
currents are found, and traced step by step to their source, the 
furnace, the steam plant, or the stove. The motive for investiga- 
tion is strong because the pupils are dealing with a bit of daily life;
-P-A-G-E-230
  220 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
the problems are of intense interest because they are the pupils’ 
own. ! 
How the work in science is actually being carried forward 
in the schools can be seen from the following outlines taken 
from the syllabi or courses of study of several more or less 
typical school systems. 
MENOMINEE, MICHIGAN 
Physiology (seventh grade). Looking upon the human body from 
the physical point of view as the most perfect, most ingeniously 
economical, and most beautiful of living machines, this course 
gives practical instruction in the running of this human machine. 
A study of personal, home, school, and community hygiene is 
emphasized. 
Science (eighth-grade boys). General Science is a brief study of 
accepted facts and principles found in everyday life. It includes a 
brief course in the subjects of chemistry, physics, and physiology, 
with a number of simple laboratory experiments. Special emphasis 
is laid on problems that interest boys especially. 
| Scvence (eighth-grade girls). An introduction to science appli- 
cable to the daily lives of these girls. Such subjects are taught as 
household chemistry, the selection of paints, varnishes, and oils 
for actual daily use, the examination of fuels and their adaptability 
to furnaces and kitchen range; the investigation of school and home 
lighting, and their influence upon eyesight; the utilization of simple 
labor-saving devices to relieve physical exertion; and the applica- 
tion of hygienic facts and theories to school, home, and community 
sanitation. 
Science (ninth grade). The science course, which is the con- 
tinuation of the eighth-grade course, deals with the large and con- 
crete things which surround boys and girls and in which they are 
materially interested. The scientific analysis of home problems is 
emphasized.’

MONMOUTH, ILLINOIS 
General Science 
Introductory. An increasing interest as to what science shall 
be taught in the junior high school has developed with the progress 
and success of the junior high school. A course in general science 
is rapidly becoming the first course of the science sequence. It is 
intended for immature minds. It includes the whole broad terri- 
tory of the physical universe. The natural sciences are not in- 
cluded as a collection of sciences, but the course is so organized that 
the pupil, while dealing with some known facts, will be continuously 
relating them to phenomena about him which are of vital interest 
to him and which stimulate the mind and supply it with the ele- 
mentary materials of thought. The laws and principles of the 
physical sciences are of primary importance in dealing with home 
and school environment. 
Aims. The fundamental aim for the teaching of general science 
is to awaken an intelligent interest in the natural environment of 
the pupil to the end that he may, to some extent, correctly interpret 
that environment and be master of it. The wonderful phenomena 
of nature must be made of vital interest to the pupils. Every 
opportunity should be embraced to stimulate their self-activity and 
to induce them to use the knowledge acquired. If a child is to reach 
maturity with a proper insight into physical laws, forces, products, 
utilities, and inventive appliances, he must begin early to observe 
closely and accurately and to feed the spirit of inquisitiveness and in- 
vestigation. It thus becomes a part of his life and character. The 
work is intended to stimulate the pupils to use science in their con- 
structive work and to lead them to be independent as they develop 
in powers of observation and interpretation. 
Method. The main question is how to get the problems of science 
before children in such a way as to bring them to the best exercise 
of their own independent powers in solving them. Each object in 
nature raises a question. Urge pupils to ask questions about every- 
thing they see of which they desire an explanation. Such procedure 
will suggest many problems for study. The purpose of such instruc- 
tion is more than to get the facts and principles into the mind 
of the child. Do not tell him how a telephone works. Get him 
to working with a telephone, pulleys, etc., testing out advantages 
by working with them. Get the child to reach his own conclusion,
-P-A-G-E-232
  
222 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
answer his own questions ; he may not reach the correct conclusion 
the first time, but use other experiments to illustrate. A general 
conclusion may spring from an observation and comparison of a 
number of different experiments of the same class. The pupils 
should construct many of the simpler toys and home appliances 
used in science lessons, such as the kite, windmill, pump, siphon, 
lever, musical instrument, balloon, etc. Simple home-made appara- 
tus is better than elaborate equipment.

RADFORD STATE NORMAL SCHOOL 
The Radford State Normal School, East Radford, Virginia, 
which prepares teachers for the rural junior high schools, 
outlines its work in general science and biology as follows : 
General Science 
We train teachers for teaching general science in the rural schools. 
The class taught is in our training school. There are usually twenty 
or thirty pupils, all girls. The class has kept the weather record for 
the school, made a survey of the town and vicinity in order to study 
the peculiar topography of the New River valley, wired the Adminis- 
tration Building for electric bells, made and used fireless cookers, 
thermos boxes, barometers, iceless refrigerators, and other devices. 
They have explored the caves of the vicinity and made field trips to 
all the manufacturing plants of the city. 
We have taught by means of topics. Each student is asked to 
make a talk before the class upon some topic which she has worked 
up from the field trips and the library. Often they write to the 
departments at Washington for material, bulletins, etc. A large 
topic is accepted in lieu of the examination. The student is allowed 
to use the school apparatus, lantern, or any outside material she is

able to secure to illustrate her topic. The teacher helps with 
suggestions and bibliography. The students are eighth grade. 
Biology 
This work is given in the ninth grade. We are preparing teachers 
to work in the rural junior high schools of Virginia. 
The class as a whole took the project this year to rid our campus 
of flies. Groups of the class were responsible for the stables, pig- 
pens, kitchen, dining room, the spaces under the windows of the 
dormitory, and one group made a survey of the neighborhood and 
tactfully enlisted the codperation of the neighbors. Other small 
problems: An aquarium stocked from streams; the birds on the 
campus; each group studied the activities of a tree from September 
to June; cockroaches in the pantry.! 
ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI 
The Ben Blewett Junior High School of St. Louis handles 
the general science work in the following manner : 
General Science 
The aim of this department is to build a sound foundation course 
for the seventh year which shall serve to give the pupils glimpses of 
the interesting fields that science explores. Interest in the world 
about them rather than amount of information being the vital 
consideration, pupils are brought into contact with many different 
phases of elementary science. Conspicuous here also is the primary 
feature in all seventh-grade work in Blewett Junior High, namely, 
the exploring of pupils’ interests, aptitudes, and abilities. General 
science in this grade aims to open up to them the larger scientific 
fields that lie beyond, to the end that wise educational guidance and 
pre-vocational choices may be made in higher grades. Topics 
discussed are as follows:

ROCHESTER, NEW YORK 
Rochester offers the general science course in the eighth 
and ninth grades. The following is the outline of the work 
given in the Course of Study, 1920, the eighth-grade work 
alone being reproduced here. 
The general aim in the science work is: 
(1) To develop the student’s power of observation so that he may 
be aware of his surroundings in a way that will enrich his 
experience. 
(2) To give the students an understanding of the common 
phenomena of their immediate environment. 
(3) To provide opportunity for practice in applying what has 
been learned to the solution of new problems. 
(4) To correct misinterpretations of natural phenomena. 
(5) To give students some idea of scientific methods of procedure 
in dealing with problems of a scientific nature. 
The topics for study are arranged in groups and the information 
and training obtained by the study of any group is made to play a 
definite part in the study of succeeding groups. The arrangement 
of groups is somewhat determined by seasonal changes. The

arrangement of topics within a group is either psychological or 
logical as the particular case demands. Throughout all courses 
the home, street, school, and city environment, as contributing 
to the physical, mental, and moral development of the student, is 
made the keynote of the science study.

LABORATORY EQUIPMENT 
For some individuals the question of laboratory equip- 
ment is a matter of concern. In the West Virginia Course 
of Study, issued by the State Board of Education, 1921, the 
following pieces are recommended as the minimum necessary 
to carry on the outlined course in general science : 
One-half dozen assorted test tubes for each pupil 
Two hydrometer jars 
Four wide-mouth bottles for each pupil 
One gross assorted corks 
Two large jars with straight sides 
One good Fahrenheit thermometer 
One good Centigrade thermometer

In conclusion, it may be said that the work in science in 
the junior high school is not intended to be unscientific in 
its methods. Quite the opposite. As the State Board of 
West Virginia puts it: 
Unless the course increases the student’s interest in scientific 
phenomena very considerably and also adds much information and 
knowledge concerning common scientific phenomena to his rather 
limited fund, it has missed the mark in so far as he is concerned.!

     CHAPTER FOURTEEN 
PRactTIcAL ARTS         HE leading purposes of the junior high school courses 
in Practical Arts are three in number: 
(1) Togive to every boy and girl in the school some appre- 
ciation of the kinds and nature of the practical activi- 
ties that go to make up the industrial and commercial 
world around them; and particularly for the girls, to 
acquaint them with the ideals and practices which 
contribute to the making of attractive, hygienic, and 
well-managed homes. 
(2) Toenable pupils, by means of try-out courses, to dis- 
cover their interests, aptitudes, and ambitions with 
respect to certain vocations, and to give them training 
in the ordinary practical affairs of home, garage, garden, 
shop, and playground. 
(8) To give specific training in particular vocations to 
pupils who show special aptitudes for such vocations ; 
those who are unable to profit by other courses; and 
those who, because of untoward circumstances, are 
unable to continue in school beyond the junior high 
school years. 
Perhaps no better formulation of the general character 
of the work in practical arts has been made than the follow- 
ing, prepared by the Commission on the Reorganization of 
Secondary Education, and published in the bulletin, Cardinal 
Principles <f Secondary Education: 
          
                
                    
                
        
            
                  In the education of every high-school girl, the household arts 
should have a prominent place because of their importance to the 
girl herself and to others whose welfare will be directly in her keeping. 
The attention now devoted to this phase of education is inadequate, 
and especially so for girls preparing for occupations not related to 
the household arts and for girls planning for higher institutions. The 
230
-P-A-G-E-241
    
PRACTICAL ARTS 231 
majority of girls who enter wage-earning occupations directly from 
the high school remain in them for only a few years, after which 
homemaking becomes their lifelong occupation. For them the high- 
school period offers the only assured opportunity to prepare for that 
lifelong occupation, and it is during this period that they are most 
likely to form their ideals of life’s duties and responsibilities. .. . 
In the education of boys, some opportunity should be found to 
give them a basis for the intelligent appreciation of the value of the 
well-appointed home and of the labor and skill required to maintain 
such a home, to the end that they may coéperate more effectively. 
For instance, they should understand the essentials of food values, 
of sanitation, and of household budgets. 
Vocational education should equip the individual to secure a 
livelihood for himself and those dependent on him, to serve society 
well through his vocation, to maintain the right relationships toward 
his fellow workers and society, and, as far as possible, to find in that 
vocation his own best development. 
This ideal demands that the pupil explore his own capacities and 
aptitudes, and make a survey of the world’s work, to the end that he 
may select his vocation wisely. Hence, an effective program of 
vocational guidance in the secondary school is essential. 
Vocational education should aim to develop an appreciation of the 
significance of the vocation to the community, and a clear conception 
of right relations between the members of the chosen vocation, be- 
tween different vocational groups, between employer and employee, 
and between producer and consumer. These aspectsof vocational 
education, heretofore neglected, demand emphatic attention. 
The extent to which the secondary school should offer training 
for a specific vocation depends upon the vocation, the facilities that 
the school can acquire, and the opportunity that the pupil may 
have to obtain such training later. 
' WHAT THE SUBJECT INCLUDES 
Practical arts, for the junior high school, include manual 
training, drawing, horticulture, agriculture, commercial 
studies, cooking, sewing, millinery, and household manage- 
ment. Each one of these subjects is likewise subdivided ac- 
cording to its branches. There seem to be good reasons —

social, intellectual, ethical, and exsthetical — for providing 
work of these kinds throughout each grade of the junior high 
school, and for prescribing it for all classes, especially dur- 
ing the seventh and eighth years. Concerning this matter, 
Professors Crawshaw and Selvidge say : 
First, socially. In his daily environment the child sees and feels 
the great physical activity of the community. He is an imitative 
being; consequently he strives to copy the movements of his fellows, 
among whom are his elders. ... The teaching of manual arts 
offers an opportunity for the school to give the individual this 
peculiar mental attainment which results from an intercommunica- 
tion between members of a group. 
The school of the past has not fitted the child for the industrially 
practical things of life, because the fundamental industrial activities 
have not been given due consideration in school processes. It has 
dealt with the theoretical almost to the exclusion of the practical. 
The work which demands the use of the handsin skilled labor must be 
the means of livelihood for the major portion of the adult population. 
Such being the case, the school has an obligation to the community to 
give its pupils knowledge of a functioning sort. If, then, the shop 
and the drawing room, the kitchen and the laboratory, will serve to 
furnish children information which later on will give them a com- 
munity standing, these instruments point the way toward desirable 
socialand economicends. Ideals in life are established in the manual 
arts work which cannot be conceived by the non-participant therein. 
We cannot fully appreciate the viewpoint of the worker in any walk 
in life until we ourselves are put in his place. 
Second, ethically. By this term we mean to express that 
quality which leads one to discriminate between those things which 
emphasize the best in life and those which are commonplace or even 
bad. In recitation work it is not impossible for one to deceive his 
fellows and even himself as to the degree of his understanding of a 
subject. The recitation may be based upon a clear, an acquired, or 
a borrowed understanding. It may be the audible form of any one 
of these and yet in reality be either of the other two. 
When, on the other hand, the recitation takes the form of a finished 
project worked out in some tangible material, there can be no mistake 
as to its representing just what the maker understands about his 
subject. The exact measure of his ability is shown in the finished

product. It is good, bad, or indifferent, depending upon a clear, a 
poor, or a partial understanding of all the elements which enter into 
it. Thus ideals are established. .. . 
Third, artistically. In the study of soft tones, pleasing colors, 
harmonious lines, and satisfying proportions, as well as in good con- 
struction, do the students of manual training become better able to 
appreciate the true meaning of artistic.! 
TRY-OUT COURSES 
The plan of having the seventh-grade work made up of 
try-out courses seems highly desirable. To permit, for ex- 
ample, boys of this grade to spend ten weeks in woodwork- 
ing, ten in machine shop, ten in forge or metal work, and ten 
in printing, is an arrangement that harmonizes with the ideals 
of the junior high school. To allow the girls to test their 
interests for ten-week terms in sewing, cooking, millinery, 
and household design is likewise defensible in theory. To 
permit both boys and girls in the seventh or the eighth grade 
to obtain an elementary knowledge of horticulture and flori- 
culture, and to have a try-out experience with bookkeeping, 
typewriting, stenography, and other forms of commercial 
work is likewise desirable and feasible. Indeed, there seems 
to be no valid reason why pupils should not be permitted to 
elect some kind of pre-vocational work each term of each 
junior high school year. Such work possesses educational 
value. Furthermore, the opportunity to elect pre-vocational 
courses tends to hold some pupils in school who otherwise 
would withdraw as soon as occasion permitted. An oppor- 
tunity of this kind will enable individual pupils to lay the 
foundation for specific vocational work while continuing to 
pursue, somewhat longer than otherwise would be possible, 
a cultural and liberal course.

  PRACTICAL ARTS 235 
SOCIAL AND CIVIC ASPECTS 
But it is not alone for the sake of a future vocation that 
vocational work should be offered in the junior high school. 
The Commission on the Reorganization of a Secondary Edu- 
cation says: 
It is only as a pupil sees his vocation in relation to his citizenship 
and his citizenship in the light of his vocation that he will be pre- 
pared for effective membership in an industrial democracy. Con- 
sequently, this Commission enters its protest against any and all 
plans, however well intended, which are in danger of divorcing voca- 
tion and social-civic education. It stands squarely for the infusion 
of vocation with the spirit of service and for the vitalization of cul- 
ture by genuine contact with the world’s work.! 
If vocational considerations are to be the sole or chief 
reasons for providing courses in practical arts, then it is 
illogical to prescribe any of this work — even try-out courses 
— for pupils whose future careers are definitely fixed in fields 
wherein actual manual training is not required. It is even 
illogical to prescribe practical arts for the pupil whose fu- 
ture is not determined; for, taking the country as a whole, 
relatively few boys who are pursuing elementary courses in 
woodwork, ironwork, or typesetting will ever. make carpen- 
try, smithing, or printing their life vocations. Neither will 
many of the girls who are pursuing household arts courses 
undertake employment as milliners, seamstresses, caterers, 
or horticulturists. 
Except for the very few, practical arts courses are to 
be justified on other than vocational grounds. So far as 
manual training courses for boys are concerned, Professor 
Bobbitt has stated the case concisely, and, with the sub- 
stitution of “household arts” for “manual training,” his 
remarks apply equally well to girls. He says: 
1 Cardinal Principles of Secondary Education, page 16.
-P-A-G-E-246
  236 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
1. It (manual training) provides concrete experiences with the 
tools, materials, and processes employed in important economic 
fields. It gives the boys the alphabet of experience necessary for 
appreciating some of the labors of that complex economic world in 
which they must play their specialized parts. 
2. It is preparation for the performance of many kinds of un- 
specialized activities about the house, furnace-room, garden, garage, 
motor car, etc. It is individually and socially economical] for the 
individual himself to take care of a considerable number of mis- 
cellaneous mechanical labors rather than to turn them over to 
specialists. ‘This diversity of experience is otherwise good for the 
individual in a number of ways. We cannot here enter into the 
arguments, but it appears that there is large justification, not well 
developed in our usual professional theory, for setting up a very 
considerable range of unspecialized abilities as educational objectives. 
These demand diversified experiences with tools, materials, and 
processes of kinds that the ordinary man currently meets with. It 
demands a program that is quite different in many respects from the 
conventional manual-training, mechanical-drawing program. The 
recent tendency in progressive high schools to introduce the assem- 
bling and disassembling of all sorts of familiar machines and contri- 
vances, automobile adjustment and repair, furniture repair, short 
courses in many technical fields, as, for example, cement construc- 
tion, sheet-metal work, painting and decorating, gardening, etc., 
appears to indicate a considerable recognition of these unspecialized 
objectives. It must be confessed, however, that for any such goals 
of effort the usual manual-training courses are in need of large read- 
justment.! 
TYPICAL COURSES OF STUDY 
In conformity with the views of Professor Bobbitt, many 
junior high schools have lately reorganized their work in 
manual training. To show the kind of work that is offered 
in various schools, several typical courses of study in practi- 
cal arts are given here.

JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
Monmouth, Illinois 
Monmouth, Illinois, describes its work in manual training 
for the seventh and eighth grades as follows: 
INDUSTRIAL ARTS 
Seventh Grade 
Time: 160 minutes per week 
Work: 7 B— First Semester: Concrete 
The purpose is to give the boys an introduction to the composi- 
tion, manufacture, characteristics, uses, and handling of 
concrete. To connect with wood work, a few simple wooden 
tools are made; straight edge, wooden trowel, measuring box; 
a further correlation with wood work is made in the construc- 
tion of forms for models, casts, foundations, ete. Projects 
consist of: flower pots, window boxes, bird baths, ete. The 
class also do small jobs of work needed about the schools and 
for patrons. 
7 A — Second Semester: Electrical work 
An elementary course, mostly of an experimental nature, supple- 
mented with talks, demonstrations, outside readings, and class 
reports. No attempt is made to explain the deeper theories of 
electricity, but rather to teach the boys what electricity does. 
Shop drawing is correlated with the work. The projects for 
this work are: making magnets, batteries, electro-magnets ; 
installing regular telegraph, telephone, and electric call bells 
and electric light systems; construction of motor, induction 
coil, ete. 
Whenever electrical wiring needs to be done for the schools, 
the work is turned over to this class if it is within their abilities. 
Some good jobs have been done. 
Eighth Grade 
  Time: 160 minutes per week 
Work: 8 B — First Semester: Cabinet work and Joinery: Shop 
Sketching 
This course aims to give practice in the more difficult types of 
joinery which yet are within the ability of an eighth-grade boy. 
Each problem involves the fitting together or joining of two 
or more members to form a completed project. Most of the 
   
-P-A-G-E-249
  PRACTICAL ARTS 239 
common joints are employed, including the half lap, rabbeted, 
bridle, matched, mortise and tenon, and doweled. It is 
thought that the multiple dovetail is too difficult; also fancy 
panelling. The finishes emphasized are stain, shellac, wax, oil, 
and paint. The pupils make a shop drawing of each project 
before undertaking its construction, thus correlating elementary 
drawing with their shop constructions. 
In the shop there are listed over fifty projects from which the 
boys may choose. In addition to the problems regularly on 
file, the boys bring in a variety of practical problems of their 
own. Some bring furniture from home and repair it at the 
school shop. The boys also do a great deal of repair and new 
construction work for the schools; such as building bulletin 
boards, flower boxes, etc., and repairing seats and other equip- 
ment. Whenever a boy ‘does not want to make anything for 
himself he is put on one of the school jobs. The boys pay 
for the cost of the material entering into any project which 
they are constructing for themselves. 
8 A — Second Semester: Carpentry and Cabinet Work 
The interest and the instruction in the course center around 
some real carpentry jobs which the class undertakes during the 
semester. These real jobs are in the form of contracts for 
building garages, sheds, small houses, repairing buildings, 
etc. The garage makes an ideal problem for such a class to 
start on. After a garage has been completed a small house 
may safely be undertaken. During the present semester the 
carpentry class is building a garage and adding a kitchen toa 
house. Cabinet work supplements the work in carpentry. It 
follows the usual line of projects, avoiding those either too diffi- 
cult or too heavy to manage well in the shop.! 
Menominee, Michigan 
The course of study for 1920-21 of the Menominee, Mich- 
igan, schools outlines the work in manual training as follows: 
MANUAL TRAINING 
Manual training is required of all boys five seventy-five-minute 
periods per week throughout the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades 
and is elective in the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grades.

Chicago 
While Chicago has no definitely organized junior high 
schools, it offers, in sixty-seven elementary schools, handwork 
that corresponds in aim and content to the practical arts 
work commonly provided in the junior high school. The fol- 
lowing report shows the nature and extent of the Chicago 
courses : 
THE HANDWORKS TAUGHT IN THE SCHOOLS 
Sixteen different handworks are found in sixty-seven schools 
organized on the Intensive Handwork plan. They are as follows:

Sewing and woodwork are the only handworks obtaining in all the 
sixty-seven schools. One school has no cooking — doubtless owing 
to the lack of a kitchen. Printing comes next in popularity, being 
in thirty schools. Mechanical drawing is in fifteen schools and 
laboratory science in nine. Laboratory science is classed as a shop 
subject because of the fact that it can be taught to but a one-half 
division and also because of its close relationship to the handworks.

Outside of these six major handworks there is very sparse repre- 
sentation.! 
Los Angeles 
Los Angeles, California, outlines its courses in Household 
Arts as follows: 
HOME ECONOMICS 
The underlying purpose of the course in home economics in the 
Los Angeles city schools is to create and develop individuality, 
efficiency, and self-dependence, giving the girl a better understanding 
of the duties of women as producers and consumers, and intensifying 
the interest in all matters pertaining to the home and the extension 
of its influence. 
DOMESTIC ART 
The aim of this work is to develop appreciation for the artistic and 
appropriate in dress and in the furnishing and decoration of the 
home, good judgment in the purchasing of materials, and technical 
skill in the planning and construction of garments. Emphasis is 
placed on simplicity, economy, and artistic line and color combina- 
tion. 
The work comprises a study of the textile fibers with relation to 
their growth and processes of manufacture into cloth, of the adul- 
teration of fabrics, of the uses of different fabrics, of the planning 
and construction of garments, of the hygiene of clothing, of the care 
and repair of clothing; also a consideration of the interior decoration 
of the home from the standpoint of art and economy. 
The work is intended to meet the needs of three classes of students : 
1. Those who wish it for their own use in the home. 
2. Those who wish to make it a basis for advanced study in 
colleges or normal school. 
3. Those who will use it as a means of earning a livelihood after 
leaving the high school. 
DOMESTIC SCIENCE 
A systematic study is made of the production and manufacture 
of food materials, their wholesomeness and digestibility, nutritive 
value and cost; at the same time, training is given constantly in 
1 Chicago Schools, Bulletin No. 15, page 20, 1919.

neatness, order, foresight, and personal responsibility. The students 
work individually and in groups; in this way independence is de- 
veloped, and a spirit of mutual helpfulness is fostered. The subject 
is closely correlated with all the sciences. 
The special aims are to teach: (a) the scientific principles under- 
lying food preparation; (b) skill in manipulation of utensils and 
food materials; (c) attractive preparation and serving of simple 
meals; (d) scientific accuracy in measurements and work; (e) the 
essentials in the selection and purchase of all materials for the home." 
Buffalo 
In the schools of Buffalo, New York, shop work and house- 
hold arts are outlined as follows: 
SHOP WORK 
The shop work should be more extensive in amount and far more 
diversified in content than at present. Instead of a narrow ex- 
perience in the formal treatment of wood alone, opportunity should 
be provided for the practical handling of all the principal materials 
used in modern manufacture and construction. 
The purposes of this broader use of the shops should be: 
(a) To utilize the constructive instincts in the development of 
mind and body. 
(b) To create an appreciation of constructive workmanship and 
the dignity of labor. 
(c) To assist in vitalizing the study of art, science, geography, 
arithmetic, history, and civics. 
(d) To provide a basis for the study of industrial occupations. 
(e) To assist the youth in the choice of vocation by testing his 
interest and ability in the industrial field. 
(f) To develop skill and knowledge that will be of special value 
in future vocational training for the industries. 
HOUSEHOLD ARTS 
The practical arts work for girls should be conducted in ac- 
cordance with the same general principles that dominate the shop 
work for boys. Special emphasis, however, should be placed upon 
1 Los Angeles Course of Study, page 86, 1917-1918. 
 
-P-A-G-E-257
  
  PRACTICAL ARTS 247 
training in all the household arts with the particular view to their 
application and usefulness in the home. ‘The usual courses should 
be expanded and supplemented to cover the general treatment of 
foods, clothing, and shelter, through extended use of the selection 
and buying of food and its preparation, cooking, serving, and care; 
the choosing and purchasing of clothing materials; the construction, 
care and repair of garments, hats, and other wearing apparel; home- 
planning, decorating and furnishing; housekeeping, household 
maintenance and repair; economical expenditure of money for per- 
sonal and household needs; and the study of industry in relation to 
the home.! 
HOME ECONOMICS 
Speaking of the course in home economics, the Sub-Com- 
mittee of the Commission on the Reorganization of Secondary 
Education, reporting in February, 1921, made the follow- 
ing pronouncement : 
The purpose of general home economics is to help secure and 
maintain the best type of home and family life as vital forces in 
American society. The best type of home is a place in which 
children may be protected, nurtured, and developed into men and 
women, sound of body, trained in mind, disciplined in character, and 
prepared to assume their rightful duties and responsibilities in a 
working world. A satisfactory home is, moreover, a place in which 
the worker may secure rest, refreshment, and recreation, and wherein 
he may be revitalized for his contact with the outside world.? 
Continuing, the Committee stated the aims of the general 
home economics course in elementary and high schools to be 
as follows: 
To prepare the pupils for helpful and worthy membership in their 
present homes. ‘To accomplish this aim it is necessary to develop 
skill in the use of household materials, utensils, and machinery, to 
inculcate such personal habits and standards as to food, clothing, and 
surroundings as will insure good physical health; to train to thrift, 
economy, and business methods that the pupil may appreciate the

problems confronting the administrator of the family income; to 
apply to daily life the fundamental laws of beauty of color, line, and 
form; and to establish such standards of character as will result in 
consideration for the comfort and convenience of others and in will- 
ing service for the common good. 
Surely this ideal comprehends much more than instruc- 
tion in cooking and sewing and relates itself much more 
closely to the pupil’s home life and home experiences than 
that of an older day. 
The Committee above mentioned further recommends 
that the time allotment for the course in the seventh and 
eighth grades be “two double periods equaling about one 
hundred and eighty minutes; one single period, equaling 
about forty-five minutes for supervised study, recitation, 
etc.; study, practice, and observation at home, ninety 
minutes.’ This gives a total which is equivalent to one 
period of forty-five minutes a day for the five school days 
and ninety minutes for home activities relating to the school 
work. 
The Committee outlines the three-year course in a series 
of (1) school projects; (2) home projects; and (3) topics 
for investigation, report, and discussion. The Committee 
further makes much use of the principle of correlation, ad- 
vocating its employment continually. 
The following is the general plan of the courses proposed : 
Seventh Grade 
First Quarter, Topic: The care of clothing; thrift in selecting 
and making. Correlated with geography, English, arithmetic, 
art, and general science. 
Second and Third Quarters, Topic: Meal preparation and 
service, correlated with English, geography, arithmetic, hy- 
giene, and general science. 
Fourth Quarter, Topic: The choice and making of simple 
clothing. Correlated with arithmetic, bookkeeping, general 
science, art, and hygiene. 
 
-P-A-G-E-259
  PRACTICAL ARTS 249 
Eighth Grade 
First and Second Quarters, Topic: Food preservation, market- 
ing, food stuff, food accounts. 
Third Quarter, Topic: Economy in the use of clothing. Study 
of costs. 
Fourth Quarter, Topic: (1) Summer clothing, — its use and 
care. (2) Garments for infants, home nursing, and care of 
little children during summer. 
Ninth Grade: survey course 
First Quarter, Topic: Clothing studies in relation to health- 
ful and economic living. 
Second Quarter, Topic: Food studies in relation to healthful 
and economic living. | 
Third Quarter, Topic: The home and itscare. Studies dealing 
with making the living place a healthful, attractive home, 
wherever it may be. 
Fourth Quarter, Topic: Family and personal finances. Wise 
and thoughtful spending and saving. 
COMMERCIAL TRAINING 
That commercial studies deserve a place in the junior 
high school will scarcely be questioned. Not only do these 
subjects possess educational values which contribute to 
the ends of general culture, but they likewise, for many 
pupils, furnish the most suitable kind of pre-vocational and 
vocational training. As in the other types of practical arts 
work, here too good pedagogy will doubtless suggest that 
the beginning courses shall give to pupils a general view of 
the entire field, and that the later courses shall build on the 
knowledge thus gained. Again, the judgment of the Com- 
mission on the Reorganization of Secondary Education is 
important in this matter. The Sub-Committee on Business
-P-A-G-E-260
  250 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
Education in Secondary Schools, reporting in 1919, made 
the following recommendations : 
The question has insistently been asked, when may commercial in- 
struction properly begin? With the introduction of the junior high 
school, there has been the temptation to transfer to this school 
highly specialized instruction in shorthand, typewriting, and book- 
keeping. In other words, the aim has been to give a fairly complete 
technical training by the completion of the ninth or tenth school 
year. The committee regards this tendency as regrettable. 
The committee believes that “try-out’’ commercial instruction 
of a general character may well be given in the seventh and eighth 
school years. Such a procedure has the double advantage of giving 
all the pupils some knowledge of commercial affairs, which knowledge 
will be of value to them no matter what line of work they may later 
enter upon; and, secondly, it gives the basis for an intelligent choice 
of school subjects. Any plan which requires pupils at the beginning 
of the seventh or the eighth school year to make a choice of future 
occupation that cannot later be easily changed must work great 
harm. At this time they have not had the experience, nor have they 
the knowledge, to choose wisely. If the choice be made by their 
parents it will, in many cases, be made from prejudice or whim, and 
will not be based in the pupil’s natural abilities and inclinations, nor 
will the choice be made with full regard for the pupil’s ultimate 
larger good. 
It is further our opinion that the commercial education of the 
ninth school year may well be of a somewhat general character, such 
as giving training in the use of the typewriter, the teaching of the 
fundamentals of accounts, and such practical applications of general 
subjects as will serve at once as a foundation for later commercial 
instruction and be of practical use to those who must leave school at 
the end of the ninth year. 
In discussing the commercial curriculum, the Committee 
very justly takes the position that a single, definite, and fixed 
curriculum for all schools is not wise, but that each community 
should work out its scheme, having due regard to “the time 
and opportunity which the pupil or pupils may give to the

studies, their probable future life interests, and the obvious 
community needs.” The Committee makes the following 
recommendations : 
Eighth Year: First Lessons in Business 
This course includes : business habits, record work, business forms, 
systems of filing, taking and executing orders, art of wrapping and 
shipping goods, messenger service, work of stock clerks, making 
change and preparing money for deposit, simple accounts and journal 
entries, and drill in penmanship. 
Ninth Year: Elementary Bookkeeping and Typewriting 
For this course, the following outline is used :

11. Journalizing. 
Posting and taking a trial balance. 
Making statements of profit and loss and of assets and lia- 
bilities. 
Closing simple profit and loss accounts into the proprietor’s 
or investment account by journal entries. 
Filing business papers. 
Fundamental ruling work in connection with ledger accounts, 
statements, etc. 
Making out monthly statements of personal accounts. 
Handling the various business forms in their relation to busi- 
ness transactions. 
Cash, trade, and bank discounts and interest transactions. 
Draft work during the last month of the year, but it should 
be of a simple character. 
Use of the following books: Journal, sales book, invoice book 
or purchase book, cash book, check book, and ledger.*

  PRACTICAL ARTS 253 
Nevertheless, general or introductory courses in the subject 
are appropriate for the schools in large municipalities. 
American national life is too dependent upon the farms and 
farm people ever to permit the development, among urban 
residents, of a spirit of indifference to the problems of rural 
communities. For the boys and girls reared in the city, a 
general course in agriculture should prove of real socializ- 
ing value. When town and country come to understand bet- 
ter each other’s problems and points of view, the tendency 
of each to undervalue and misinterpret the activities and 
interests of the other will decrease, and a finer economic, 
social, and political condition will result. On the other 
hand, for country boys and girls — particularly those who 
are likely to spend the greater portion of their adult life on 
farms — specific courses in agriculture are as important in 
pre-vocational or vocational education as are the manual 
arts courses for their city cousins. Indeed, for girls in rural 
sections, there is as much need for a practical arts course deal- 
ing with the home and adapted to country conditions as 
there is for a differentiation in the practical arts courses 
offered to boys in town and country. 
In the junior high school, it is doubtful if any except the 
most elementary work in agriculture should be given. Cer- 
tainly, however, a course that deals in an elementary way 
with farm animals, farm crops, soils, weeds, insects, dairy- 
ing, poultry raising, and vegetable and flower gardening is 
appropriate to the seventh or eighth grade, in either city or 
country. Beyond this elementary course for rural schools, 
a course given in the ninth grade and including such items 
as the following has merit: physiology, hygiene, and farm 
sanitation; insect pests; plant diseases; animal husbandry ; 
farm practice, farm mechanics, and project work. 
For girls in rural schools, a course dealing with the care of 
| the home and another dealing with floriculture, horticulture,

and poultry raising seem especially needed. A sample of 
the first of these is presented in a bulletin of the Bureau 
of Education. The outline of the course is as follows: 
(1) Arrangement and care of the kitchen; (2) care of cupboards 
and utensils; (3) care of food; (4) disposal of waste; (5) making 
soap; (6) setting the table; (7) waiting on table; (8) general 
cleaning of a room; (9) care of the bedroom; (10) care of lamps; 
(11) prevention of pests; (12) removing stains, bleaching fabrics, 
and setting colors; (13) washing dish towels, curtains, etc.; 
(14) ironing; (15) care of the baby; (16) cost of food, clothing, and 
house; (17) how to keep accounts; and (18) care of the exterior of 
the house.? 
The other two outlined courses given by Miss Lyford deal 
respectively with cooking and sewing. 
Topics that might very properly be included in the sug- 
gested course in floriculture, horticulture, and poultry rais- 
ing are: the purposes and values of the undertakings; the 
ordering of seed catalogues; the selection of seeds; the best 
arrangement of the garden; soils, fertilizer, and drainage of 
the garden; making a planting calendar; making and oper- 
ating a hotbed; protection of plants from imsects and dis- 
ease; irrigating; harvesting and preserving the products. 
So far as the course relates to poultry raising the following 
topics may well be included: description of the breeds and 
varieties of poultry; the production, preservation, and mar- 
keting of eggs; the fattening and marketing of poultry; in- 
cubation and brooding; and the fall, winter, and summer care 
of poultry. 
A TYPICAL COURSE IN AGRICULTURE 
The following outline shows the manner in which agricul- 
ture is taught in the junior high schools of Los Angeles :

INTRODUCTORY AGRICULTURE 
B8,A8 
This course is designed primarily for the students in the eighth 
grade, to familiarize them with the elements of agricultural practice. 
The study of plant and animal life, their relation to each other 
and to man, will be carried on through the use of gardens, smaller 
domestic animals, laboratory exercises, and field excursions. 
PLANT PROPAGATION 
The object of this course is to familiarize the student with 
practical methods of propagation, and the production of vegetables, 
berries, and ornamental plants; to study the commercial value and 
industrial possibilities in their production; and to develop their 
appreciation of the use of plants for home and public ornamentation. 
The course will include individual work in vegetable and or- 
namental gardening, propagation of flowers, shrubs, trees, vegetables, 
and berries, by methods best suited for each. This will be done in 
the gardens, glass-houses, lath-houses, cloth-houses, hotbeds, and 
cold frames. Also class work, reference reading and trips to parks, 
gardens, nurseries, and markets. 
B9, A9 
The course will extend through the year. Emphasis will be placed 
on the practical side and conducted to the best advantage, according 
to seasons.! 
A COURSE IN GENERAL MECHANICS 
As showing the views of an educator of broad training and 
varied experience in junior high school vocational work, 
there are here presented several paragraphs written by Mr. 
Howard L. Briggs, Director of Industrial Work in the Arthur 
Hill Trade School, Saginaw, Michigan. Mr. Briggs says: 
The junior high school is essentially a period of transition. The 
child’s first vocational contact should therefore be based upon his past 
experience, his present needs, his immediate interests. Rarely has a 
child of thirteen years of age developed beyond the call of play

incentive. His past vocational contacts have largely been built up 
about this instinct. We must therefore start his vocational ex- 
perience in school through this medium. The child is living in an 
age of imitation .. . but it is also an age of fleeting interests. 
There is no desire to remain upon any one project very long. It is 
a period of review rather than of completion. 
Our first year’s work should therefore meet these requirements. 
I would call it a transitional course. Its work would be based upon 
the child’s past experience in “fixing things’? at home and would 
meet his present need for “‘helping”’ about the house. I would so 
present the work that I would appeal to the play instinct and the 
desire to “make things.”’ I would offer a constantly changing series 
of experiences with new materials and under new conditions requiring 
but the minimum of time for the completion of each project. I 
would make all of these experiences have some practical application 
and gradually create the will “‘to do” and to accomplish, and through 
these first preliminary trade contacts lead him from the childhood 
incentive of play to a realization of his own potentialities as a pro- 
ducer, which I would develop in what I call an overview course in the 
eighth grade. 
For this course we should devise a course of study offering a variety 
of experiences of short duration covering the elementary phases of 
typical occupations of the community. It is financially and physi- 
cally impossible to cover the entire field in every community. We 
must therefore confine the teaching content to typical types of 
vocational endeavor and so arrange the experiences of the pupil 
that he will secure an overview of the entire field. 
We should couple the above with a classroom course in vocational 
information, with actual visits to commercial shops, so that the pupil 
will have the opportunity to acquire an intelligent concept of his 
own limitations and possibilities in relation to the requirements and 
opportunities of the vocations of the community. In addition he 
should secure an appreciation of the life environment of the “‘other 
fellow.” The artist, the doctor, the lawyer should have an under- 
standing of productive industry, its conditions, problems, processes, 
its human side. The industrial worker, upon the other hand, should 
have an equally sympathetic understanding of the life work of the 
professional man. The overview course should develop a desire for 
information leading to a constantly expanding concept of materials, 
tools, manipulations, operations, principles, and possibilities of

vocational activities. It should become a medium for vitalizing 
mathematics, civics, English, science, art, and all of the essentials 
of the academic curriculum. It should contribute to the vocational 
intelligence, the general experience, and the all-around development 
of the individual. It should assist the pupil in selecting and electing 
the general field of endeavor in which he will later specialize in the 
pre-vocational try-out course of the ninth grade. It should definitely 
aim to develop and to cause the individual to discover his own 
special capacities and aptitudes, his likes and dislikes. Physio- 
logically and psychologically it is the time of times to merge and 
shape existing interests into intensive life purposes through definite 
concrete experiences. 
The pre-vocational course of the ninth grade is essentially a try-out 
course. Through the pupil’s experience in the seventh and eighth 
grade he should be in a position to decide upon the particular general 
field in which his interests lie. He should decide between industrial, 
professional, agricultural, or commercial vocations although he is not 
ready fora decision in regard to any specific branch of his chosen field
-P-A-G-E-270
260 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
of specialization. He has reached the first turning point; he must 
come to a realization of the seriousness of life, of individual re- 
sponsibility, of the necessity of preparation for a definite vocation. 
The experiences encountered in the “transitional”? shop should 
emerge during the year of “overview” from a spirit of play into 
vitalized visions of life opportunities for achievement.! 
Courses of these kinds — often styled General Mechanics 
courses — are to be found in several of the more progressive 
junior high schools throughout the country. They are 
serving a need and are yielding valuable experiences for 
young people. What the specific content of such courses 
shall be is given by Mr. Briggs in an outline of his own work, 
as follows:

Continuing, Mr. Briggs says: 
In many cases the subjects suggested may be only touched upon. 
Printing, for instance, could consist of the simplest work, such as 
tickets, job directions, etc. We should, however, make the work of 
actual value in the way of experience and use metal type and not 
rubber. The machine work could be limited to a motor-driven 
grinder, a bench drill, drill press, and a small turning lathe. 
  VOCATIONAL TRAINING 
That the junior high school owes an especial obligation to 
society for the appropriate training of the retarded pupils
-P-A-G-E-272
  262 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
and the probable drop-outs is obvious to any analyst of 
present-day conditions. In particular the junior high school 
ought to give to these individuals a social-civic education 
rich in practical, early-functioning elements, and a pre- 
vocational (or indeed, in some cases, a vocational) training 
as extensive and as unique as individual circumstances make 
necessary and possible. Not that the junior high school 
ought to become, in any general sense, a trade school. Cer- 
tainly not. But experience is proving conclusively that it 
is pedagogical folly to seek to hold certain types of pupils 
to much so-called “ academic’”’ work, while, on the other 
hand, experience is demonstrating that individuals and 
society alike profit notably when appropriate forms of 
quasi-vocational instruction are provided for these pupils. 
Mr. Glass, discussing this phase of the subject, writes : 
Particularly for these groups should there be in the program 
of studies a liberal amount of social-science materials, and es- 
pecially social and civic activities, so that principles of social co- 
operation and citizenship may be translated into conduct in the 
educational period which immediately precedes the entrance of the 
junior high school drop-outs into society and active citizenship. 
If their civic-mindedness is not to be undermined by the blighting 
influence of becoming industrial misfits and consequently social and 
civic cynics, the junior high school must offer to these over-aged and 
backward groups occupational training sufficient in extent to as- 
sure initial vocational placement. The junior high school can at 
least serve as a school of pre-vocational try-out and thereby replace, 
to an extent, the shifting from job to job in correcting industrial 
misfits during employment. If the junior high school can serve, 
even to a small degree with its limited facilities, in the prevention 
of industrial misfits and the consequent undermining of civic- 
mindedness, it will earn a degree of public confidence not possible 
through any other single service. 
Pursuant to these ideas, it is the judgment of many edu- 
cators that commercial, industrial, and agricultural courses 
 
-P-A-G-E-273
PRACTICAL ARTS 263 
of distinct trade bents should be included in all grades of the 
typical junior high school. Thus, for example, Boston, in 
adopting this principle of guidance, states its plans respect- 
ing commercial work as follows: 
Many pupils are preparing for commercial pursuits. From 
Grade VII onward they are keenly interested in subject-matter 
that is preparatory to business. ‘To satisfy the demands of this 
large group of pupils, outlines of work in clerical practice have been 
prepared by a council of teachers, representing high and elementary 
schools. The work in clerical practice is designed to be, and is, 
eminently practical. It recognizes the importance of giving those 
pupils who must leave school early in order to enter the business 
world, such a knowledge and practical command of the elementary 
principles of business practice as shall enable them to enter upon 
their work with some fair prospect of success.! 
Similarly, Mr. Gould of the Los Angeles system, while 
openly opposed to making the junior high school a vocation 
school, clearly approves the principle of pre-vocational train- 
ing. He says: 
However, during the past nine years the attitude toward certain 
early aims has been definitely modified. Whereas it was originally 
expected that the junior high school would solve the question of 
vocational education, as a matter of fact it has become the belief of 
those concerned with the work that vocational education is not 
of primary concern at this age. There are at present organized in 
the junior high schools only three vocational classes which receive 
federal aid under the Smith-Hughes bill. These are in cooking 
of the home economics type, cooking of the restaurant type, and 
agriculture. 
On the other hand, it has become the desire to add sufficient equip- 
ment for shop work and other hand work to make it possible to 
give what might be called pre-vocational or “ exposure ”’ courses. 
Expansion in these lines has been extremely slow and difficult on ac- 
count of the limitations of the plants in which the schools are 
housed ‘and the relatively small amount of money available for 
equipment. One school has succeeded in gathering together suffi- 
' School Document No. 19, 1920, pages 21-22. 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
  (264 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
cient equipment to offer wood work, cement work, sheet metal work, 
electrical work, forge work, plumbing, and reed work, as well as 
agriculture. Another school is able to offer wood work, reed work, 
and electrical work. One school offers a large amount of printing 
and one other is beginning in the same line. In other words, the 
vision is not lacking but the material resources with which to real- 
ize upon the visions are not forthcoming. 
In addition to the above mentioned work the term “ vocational ” 
must include the very large amount of commercial work done, for 
shorthand, typewriting and bookkeeping are offered upon a strictly 
vocational basis. 
And finally, Mr. Glass holds up the signal of caution that 
merits the attention of all administrators dealing with the 
question involved. He says: 
Vocational curricula in the junior high school, either of a com- 
mercial or industrial nature, should not represent a forced growth. 
They must represent the actual conditions as they exist when the 
final alternative of leaving school or choosing vocational training 
is reached. Whenever it is definitely determined by the guiding 
agencies of the school that this alternative is unavoidable, pupils 
should be transferred to these occupational courses, irrespective 
of grade classification. Grade organization must give way to a 
greater purpose, that of adaptability of program of studies to 
individual need. Occupational courses are, therefore, matters 
almost wholly of individual adjustment. Arbitrary administrative 
regulations of promotion, classification, and organization should 
never be permitted to conflict with demonstrated individual needs. 
This statement does not set up an insurmountable administrative 
difficulty; it is a direct contradiction of an unwarranted adminis- 
trative practice which is frequently permitted to supersede individ- 
ual justice to pupils. The junior high school program of studies 
must insist upon the adoption of this point of view, if it would pro- 
mote equalization of educational opportunity.! 
VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 
It is obvious that the so-called practical or pre-vocational 
courses, if they are to be of value to pupils, should do more 
1 Circular, 1922, page 10. 
 
-P-A-G-E-275
  PRACTICAL ARTS 265 
than give an elementary knowledge of the materials, tools, 
and processes directly related to a single or a limited num- 
ber of vocations. What is needed is vocational information 
that will enable pupils to obtain a view of the entire field 
of human occupations, information that will enable them to 
test their vocational interests and aptitudes and to form for 
themselves opinions concerning the advantages or disad- 
vantages of particular callings. 
As Mr. Charles Martens states the case: 
The pupils should be given a knowledge of the typical industries, 
especially a knowledge of the principal occupations of the community. 
The pupils need a knowledge of the relative opportunities of the dif- 
ferent vocations as to wages, possibilities of advancement, length of 
working season, risks of life, limb and health, how to avoid the causes 
that result in loss of health and life in industrial pursuits; a course 
which will inspire the pupils with correct ideas concerning their rela- 
tion to the world of labor. Such a course makes the school studies 
more vital and real and shows the student the necessity for future 
training if he or she expects to succeed. It makes an intelligent 
choice of a vocation not only possible but probable.! 
The report of the Sub-Committee on Vocational Guidance 
of the Commission on the Reorganization of Secondary Edu- 
cation reads: 
It is not the purpose of vocational guidance to decide for young 
people in advance what occupation they should follow, nor to pro- 
ject them into life’s work at the earliest possible moment, nor to 
classify them prematurely by any system of analysis, either psycho- 
logical, physiological, social, or economic. 
Vocational guidance should be a continuous process designed to 
help the individual to choose, to plan his preparation for, to enter 
upon, and to make progress in an occupation. It calls for a progres- 
sive improvement of the public-school system and a fuller and more 
intelligent utilization of its richly diversified offerings. It requires 
a more accurate adjustment between the school and all worthy 
vocations. For some children it demands a plan of continuation 
   1“ Vocational Education in Junior High Schools,” Journal of Education, 
, page 290, September, 1916.
-P-A-G-E-276
    266 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
education and supervision in employment by educational authorities. 
It should develop an interest in the conditions prevailing in the child- 
employing industries and bring about improvement of those condi- 
tions. It should utilize the codperation of all social-service agencies 
that can be of assistance. For society at large it should result in a 
more democratic school system, a wiser economy in the expenditure 
of school time, and a more genuine culture. 
Many people, not only teachers, but also employers and business 
men, have an idea that in some mysterious way we can look into the 
future, determine what each child should be, and prepare him 
specifically for that ultimate end. This is a false conception, un- 
supported by psychology and contrary to the principles of democracy. 
Vocational guidance, properly conceived, organizes school work so 
that the pupil may be helped to discover his own capacities, aptitudes, 
and interests, may learn about the character and conditions of 
occupational life, and may himself arrive at an intelligent vocational 
decision. In other words, vocational guidance, while not ignoring 
the proper functions of personal counsel, emphasizes vocational deci- 
sion by, rather than for, the pupil and prefers to ascertain his capaci- 
ties, aptitudes, and interests through, rather than before, contacts 
with vocational activities. Since we cannot look into the future, we 
must attempt to prepare young people so that they can make each 
decision more wisely when the need for such decision arises. There- 
fore, vocational guidance, rightly conceived, does not involve de- 
ciding for young people what occupation they should follow, nor 
projecting them into life’s work at the earliest possible moment, nor 
classifying them prematurely by any system of analysis. ; 
The school must teach the youth not only how to adjust inset 
to his environment, but also how to change that environment when 
the need arises. Guidance that helps only a few individuals to 
succeed might produce a competitive system even more relentless 
than that of the present day. Vocational guidance should help in 
bringing about a codperative solution of the problems of economic 
and social life, and should help the largest possible number of 
individuals." 
The following is a description of the course in occupations, 
for vocational civics, as given in the high school at Middle- 
town, Connecticut: 
1 Bulletin No. 19, pages 9 et seq., 1918. 
 
-P-A-G-E-277
  
  PRACTICAL ARTS 267 
While the English, biology, and possibly physiography can and 
should contribute to a knowledge of vocations, a survey can be ade- 
quately accomplished only by making it a distinct subject. 
In the half-year course in vocations in the Middletown (Conn.) 
High School there are studied, by the boys, fifty of the common vo- 
cations, including professions, trades, and other life occupations. A 
similar course, but somewhat briefer, is being organized for the 
girls. 
In studying each of the vocations we touch upon its healthfulness, 
remuneration, value to society, and social standing, as well as upon 
natural qualifications, general education, and special preparation 
necessary for success. Naturally we investigate at first hand as 
many as possible of the vocations found in our city and vicinity. 
We have each pupil bring from home first-hand and, as far as prac- 
ticable, “‘inside”’ facts concerning his father’s occupation. We also 
invite local professional men, engineers, business men, manufac- 
turers, mechanics, and agriculturists to present informally and quite 
personally the salient features of their various vocations. However, 
strange as it has seemed to us, these experts, not being teachers, often 
miss the mark completely and present phases of their work of little 
interest or value to the pupils, although each speaker has had ex- 
plained to him carefully beforehand the purpose of the course in 
vocations and specifically just what is desired in his particular 
address.! 
Educators have employed various methods in order to 
obtain data to guide them in advising students. Among 
these methods are personal conferences with pupils and 
their parents, former teachers, and acquaintances, the use 
of composition papers written by pupils, and self-analysis 
blanks filled out by pupils. When used with delicacy and 
discretion, all of these methods are helpful. 
By way of illustration, the self-analysis report used in 
the Grand Rapids Public Schools is here reprinted (pages 
268-269).

CHAPTER FIFTEEN 
Fine Arts AND Music 
O school that professes to serve the interests of all 
types of pupils can justly ignore or treat slightingly 
the artistic and emotional elements that pertain to education. 
That our schools have hitherto neglected these elements is 
not to be denied. The cause of this neglect may perhaps 
be traced to the influence of the Puritans, who held the exer- 
cise and cultivation of the emotions to be fraught with great 
dangers to individuals and to society, and who regarded 
certain forms of art as weakening to the character, if not 
indeed an open confession of sin. 
It is, therefore, only within very recent years that art and 
music have found any assured place in the public school 
curricula, and even yet the rank accorded them is not a co- 
ordinate one. Just why the pupil of artistic tastes should 
be discriminated against and not allowed to pursue vigor- 
ously the subjects that really interest him is not clear. Just 
why the refining influences of art and music are not more 
highly exalted in the scheme of things for all pupils is like- 
wise difficult to explain. That art has wonderful values, 
particularly in an age when many hours of leisure are at the 
command of the average individual, would seem to need no 
argument. That music possesses values of many sorts seems 
likewise to call for little discussion. Fundamentally, people 
live in their emotions, and no art has a more refining influence 
on the emotions than music. “I care not who makes the 
laws of a nation if I may write its songs”’ is as true today as 
it ever was. Sentiment is more powerful than logic or 
courts of law, and music is the very soul of sentiment.

    FINE ARTS AND MUSIC Q71 
VALUE AND PLACE OF ART IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
Regarding the value of music, the Maryland School Bul- 
letin says: 
Music has its uses in time of peace no less than in time of war. 
This has been true from primitive times up through the centuries, 
and it is truer today than ever before, since customs, memories, 
traditions, emotions, human sacrifice, effort and victory, individual 
and national hopes and beliefs, human sympathies, all, are recorded 
in this common and universal language, ready to be renewed, recalled, 
and retold, as we labor or are at leisure; worship or play; in child- 
hood, youth, or old age. In fact, there is no occasion in all life’s 
legitimate and wholesome experiences in which music does not 
minister to our needs. The individual when alone may be enter- 
tained, consoled, or instructed by it; and allsocial groups from a few, 
and in the humblest home, to the great public and political throngs, 
need its ministration as a morale ration, a mind and soul tonic.! 
Professor Walter Sargent, discussing the value and place 
of art in the schools, writes thus: 
The tendency emphasized above all others . . . is in the direction 
of bringing art instruction into more direct and intimate connection 
with school and home and community interest. The specific points 
of contact most emphasized are the following : 
(1) More use of drawing to illustrate other school subjects. 
(2) An especially close correlation with manual arts. 
(3) More definite attention to developing appreciation of good 
pictorial art and of excellent constructive and decorative 
design. 
The changed attitude regarding drawing and design may be 
broadly summarized in the following statements : 
(1) That the tendency is less toward trying to interest children in 
drawing as a subject, and more toward using it as an efficient 
and unique means of expressing and promoting whatever 
interests school and home and community life have awakened. 
(2) That instruction in design deals less with formal exercises 
in arrangement, and more with problems directly and practi- 
cally concerned with school and home surroundings and with

industrial life. The methods of instruction are coming to 
include, in addition to practice in designs, much experience 
in choosing as one must choose when he makes actual 
purchases." 
In the typical programs of studies shown in Chapter 
Seventeen of this volume, music and art uniformly find 
place assignments, but the time allotments accorded to them 
are rarely in excess of two periods a week. Moreover, when 
one studies these programs, the thought arises that the real 
purposes for which music and art ought to be incorporated 
in the school are, in many instances, not accomplished. It 
seems clear, therefore, that what is needed is a complete 
reorganization of the work. 
In music and art, as in the other departments of junior 
high school work, good psychology and good pedagogy sug- 
gest that the wisest approach is by means of broad intro- 
ductory courses. Not technical courses nor drill courses, 
but appreciation courses should constitute the beginning 
courses in these subjects. Furthermore, an appreciation 
of art and music comes most readily to pupils when they 
are surrounded by an artistic atmosphere. As Van Den- 
burg states it: 
If our pupils are to learn to appreciate and so to enjoy the beauti- 
ful paintings, the beautiful statues, the beautiful buildings that they 
may later have the opportunity of seeing, or to enjoy the beautiful 
music that they may later have the opportunity of hearing, some of 
us may feel that they should be led toward this enjoyment by being 
given the opportunity to develop it in the presence of the things 
they may later be led to love. Indeed, some may believe that 
children can gain an appreciation of the beautiful in art by being 
brought constantly in contact with it, in much the same way as a 
child learns to speak by constantly hearing his parents’ and play- 
mates’ conversation.”

  Q74 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
Ella Bond Johnston, after reminding us that complete 
living has for ages been declared to consist of the attainment 
and exercise of truth, goodness, and beauty, and that the 
modern world has been woefully neglectful of the last of 
these, remarks: 
It has too long been taken for granted in America that taste is 
inborn. Different degrees of capacity for acquiring it, doubtless, 
may be innate in individuals, but taste is not inborn. Bad taste is 
ignorance. Good taste is as much a matter of education as pro- 
ficiency in any branch of learning, but it cannot be learned out of 
books nor by the psychological*and scientific methods in use in our 
schools for presenting other subjects. Taste requires for its de- 
velopment the actual, environing presence of works of art — 
poetry, music, painting — to hear and see familiarly.! 
TYPICAL COURSES OF STUDY IN ART AND MUSIC 
How completely, or incompletely, schools are organizing 
their courses so as to realize these ideals can be judged in 
part by the following outlines of courses given in four cities 
in different parts of the country.

Los Angeles, California 
The art work of the Los Angeles schools is planned as 
follows: 
ART Purpose. 
The purpose of a course in art is to attain the artistic habit of 
mind; to cultivate appreciation and enjoyment of the beautiful by 
observation, by reproducing what is seen, by cultivating the imagina- 
tion through evolving new creations, by helping students to acquire 
a sense of power through skill in technique and a knowledge of the 
principles of harmony of color; to utilize in the practical affairs of 
life their technical attainments; to give labor esthetic expression ; 
and to assist in raising the standard of civic art in the community. 
Scope. 
The scope of the work in art in the Intermediate and High Schools 
includes practice in handling the different media for artistic expres- 
sion ; pictorial representation of objects within and without the class- 
room; studies from life; designing; illustration; domestic decora- 
tion; clay-modeling; applied art work in wood, metal, and other 
materials; art history and art appreciation either by lectures or by 
the study of text.

FINE ARTS AND MUSIC Q77 
Methods. 
In teaching pupils to see with understanding, to do without loss of 
individuality, to repeat again and again without discouragement in 
order to acquire skill, it is necessary that the teacher be master of 
many methods. Variety of methods as well as of work is necessary 
to bring out the different powers of the individual. To become an 
adept in developing a love for proportion, rhythm, and harmony in 
different pupils a teacher must approach them at different angles 
and with different methods, with the idea of thought in the concep- 
tion, delight in the work and adaptation to use and environment.! 
Rochester, New York 
Rochester describes its work thus: 
ART INSTRUCTION 
The aim of art instruction is to equip the student with a knowledge 
of certain governing principles that will acquaint him with standards 
or tests by which he may estimate the beauty or merit in all of his 
surroundings; also to give him a fuller understanding of art in its 
relation to his own life and to the industries of the world, thus 
establishing art education as an indispensable factor in the education 
of the American people. 
The pupils from the elementary schools come to the junior high 
school with a fair knowledge of color, with fundamental ideas of what 
is best in design together with the practical knowledge of applica- 
tion of simple designs, and with the elementary basic principles of 
perspective as applied in the drawing of objects. It is the purpose of 
the work in the junior high school to add definite gain in color ap- 
preciation, technique, and skill along lines already partly developed in 
the lower grades; to emphasize creative ability; to continue to de- 
velop a love for the beautiful wherever the child comes into contact 
with it; and to encourage self-expression in every possible way. 
The work in music is outlined along three general lines, namely, 
chorus work, appreciation, and theory, as follows: 
Seventh Grade B 
(1) Chorus work. 
Standard songs, folk songs, patriotic songs, and two and three 
part work for unchanging voices. 
1 Los Angeles, California, Course of Study, 1917-1918.
-P-A-G-E-288
  278 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
(2) Appreciation. 
Here the work is extensive rather than intensive; a study of 
orchestral instruments is made and an opportunity provided 
for making a distinction between men’s voices and women’s 
voices. 
(3) Theory. 
Rhythm, sight reading, minor mode, and scale formations. 
Seventh Grade A 
Pre-vocational work is provided during this semester as follows: 
(1) Pupils who wish to play a musical instrument other than the 
piano and who have passed a musical test given at the end of 
the seventh grade B are chosen for this class. Class lessons 
on violins, cornets, drums, and other band and orchestral 
instruments are given by a special teacher. 
(2) Special chorus work is provided. 
(3) Appreciation. 
Special attention is given to orchestral work and records of the 
best orchestras are used for this purpose. Both instruments 
and composers are studied. 
(4) Theory. 
Attention is given to scales, chords and clefs used for the 
different instruments, a study of the seating of large orchestras 
is made, and essential musical terms and characters are 
learned. 
(5) In the cultural music class, composed of pupils who take 
lessons outside of school, special vocal work is given; a general 
study of appreciation is provided for; and a special arrange- 
ment and application of theory work is made. There have 
been periods when the members of this class have gone home to 
practice lessons. In such instances a record of the time is 
kept on a special card provided for this purpose. 
Eighth Grade B and A 
(1) Chorus work is continued. 
(2) Appreciation. 
(8) Theory.!

FINE ARTS AND MUSIC 279 
Grand Rapids, Michigan 
Grand Rapids plans its music courses thus: 
Aims 
(1) To stimulate love for and appreciation of good music among 
all pupils, whether going on to high school and college or into 
factories and commercial pursuits. 
(2) To develop the ability to sing, in parts, music of a grade that 
pupils will have occasion to use after leaving school. Pupils 
should be able to read material of the difficulty of the average 
hymn tune. 
(3) To discover the pupils with pronounced musical talents and 
enable such pupils to develop their talents as a regular part of 
school work. 
Organization 
Music is required of all pupils in seventh and eighth grades. Itis 
elective in the ninth grade. Two forty-five minute periods weekly are 
devoted to music in seventh and eighth grades as well as with elective 
classes above those grades. The classes vary in size, depending upon 
the organization of classes in other subjects. Boys and girls are not 
segregated for music work but meet in mixed classes. 
Equipment : 
A classroom devoted exclusively to music; a piano in good tune; 
a phonograph and library of records; a few pictures on musical 
subjects; a bulletin board on which pupils may post clippings or 
pictures from musical papers or on musical subjects; an ample 
supply of music stands; adequate closet space for music.! 
INSTRUCTION IN MUSIC 
The Commission on the Reorganization of Secondary 
Education makes the following statements and recommen- 
dations: 
While many people go through life without a taste for music or 
any pleasure in it, the large majority of people come eventually to 
realize that with a little more opportunity for musical culture in their

  280 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
earlier years, or a little more attention to the subject on their own 
part, they would be capable of a finer enjoyment and pleasure in 
music. . .. The Committee recommends that in no case should 
chorus singing be omitted and also urges the importance of the 
orchestra.! 
That the phonograph is one of the best agencies for the 
teaching of musical appreciation is generally recognized. 
No school should be without one. The State Board of Edu- 
cation in Maryland publishes a list of records that are par- 
ticularly suitable for the public schools. The entire list 
numbers two hundred and forty-one, most of which are ap- 
propriate for use in the junior high school. The list contains

SUMMARY 
In conclusion, it may be said, first, that in much of the 
junior high school work in music, an instructor’s chief con- 
cern should be to teach pupils to recognize great master- 
pieces when they hear them; to know something about 
the composers of these masterpieces; to possess a desire 
and ability to participate in chorus singing; to be familiar 
with the various instruments that compose the modern

  FINE ARTS AND MUSIC 283 
orchestra; and to develop a taste for good music and pleasure 
in its execution. Second, that the purpose of all art in- 
struction in the junior high school is to train each pupil to 
enjoy good art in its various forms; to know something of 
the masters of art and their notable works; and to exercise, 
albeit in an elementary way, his own artistic powers.

  CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
MorALS AND MANNERS 
T is, of course, questionable just how appropriate and 
effective a distinct course of morals and manners in 
the junior high school may be. That ideals and habits per- 
taining to good form and good character should incidentally 
be taught in the junior high school (as in all other grades) 
few would deny. That topics relating to deportment may 
properly occupy definite periods of time in the lower grades 
is likewise a view that is maintained by many educators. 
That a course dealing specifically with the ethics or the prin- 
ciples of morality may wisely be offered in college or in the 
senior high school seems justified by experience. But what 
shall be the solution of the moral problem in connection with 
the junior high school years is not fully determined. 
Nevertheless the following outline of what is attempted 
in Los Angeles illustrates what may be done: ! 
Some EXpEDIENTS FoR TRAINING IN MORALS AND 
MANNERS , 
The object of the work suggested in this outline is to place before 
the students some standards of conduct and, by a concerted effort, 
to encourage improvement in manners and morals. 
The scope of the work is purely practical, with no attempt to 
elucidate the theory or philosophy of right acting. 
The instruction is given through informal discussions in small 
groups in classrooms, supplemented by talks in general assembly. 
MORALS 
(I) Honesty. 
(1) Truthfulness. 
(a) Its moral beauty. 
(6) The sure sign of a brave character.

-P-A-G-E-295
  MORALS AND MANNERS 285 
(c) Absolutely necessary to the maintenance of stable 
relations in society. Conduct of all business im- 
possible if dishonesty were predominant. 
(2) Sincerity, as opposed to deceit and flattery, a necessary 
accompaniment of all friendship. 
(3) Lying. 
(a) In the matter of excuses, claiming illness as excuse for 
tardiness or absence, when not ill. An almost 
necessary outgrowth of this is the forged excuse. 
(b) Inventing excuses for non-preparation of lessons and 
for failure to conform to time requirements in com- 
pleting work. 
(c) Alllying a species of cowardice. The boy or girl is too 
much of a coward to face the facts and meet the con- 
sequence of his conduct. 
(d) A second falsehood is almost a necessary sequel to the 
first. 
(e) On the other hand a frank confession of wrong-doing is 
a long step toward restitution. “A sin confessed is 
half redressed.”’ 
(4) Cheating. 
(a) Unfair to others in class because one appropriates with- 
out affort that which has cost the others effort. 
(b) More unfair to oneself because cheating deprives the 
boy or girl of the chief benefit to be derived from the 
school ; viz., the opportunity to develop through effort. 
(c) Independence in the acquisition of knowledge the first 
essential of the real scholar. 
(5) Stealing. 
(a) A discussion of the circumstances which create temp- 
tation, such as the desire to possess better clothes than 
one can afford or the desire to enjoy some pleasure 
which one cannot afford or of which friends disapprove. 
(b) The importance of a sturdy independence which scorns 
to appropriate others’ belongings and exults in earning 
one’s own way. 
(c) The wrong to others who may suffer greatly from even 
a small loss, as for instance the theft of a note-book 
which is due and on which a grade may depend, or 
the theft of a book at a critical time, as just before a test. 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
286 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
(d) The duty of all to take care of their belongings so as not 
to place needless temptation in others’ way. 
(II) Sympathy. 
(1) Leads to a broad understanding of others. 
(2) This understanding of others creates tolerance and a will- 
ingness to codperate in all possible ways in home and 
community life. 
(3) Sympathy, fundamental quality for those who aspire to 
be leaders. 
(a) Essential to winning the codperation of others in one’s 
own projects. 
(b) Cold natures repel: sympathetic natures attract and 
thus win the support of others. 
(III) Simplicity. 
(1) In dress. 
(a) An indication of gentle breeding which depends on 
real worth and not on externals for recognition and 
approval. 
(6) An indication of good judgment which understands 
the true value of things. Life is too precious to spend 
in overmuch care for dress. ‘‘Consider the lilies of 
the field, how they grow.”’ They have time to grow. 
(2) In speech. 
(a) Slang. The braggart. The profane. 
Refined, forceful, pleasing speech is a great asset in 
business as well as social life. Acquired only by effort. 
(3) In actions. 
(a) The ostentatious. The haughty. The trifling. The 
overstraining for effect in conversation and con- 
duct reacts on character, making it more and more 
artificial and insincere. 
(IV) Loyalty. 
(1) To one’s family. 
Even faults, weaknesses, and sins furnish no excuse for 
failure in loyalty to one’s family. 
(2) To one’s friends. 
Friends need help most when they are in trouble. 
(3) To one’s school. 
(a) In protecting its property. 
   
-P-A-G-E-297
  MORALS AND MANNERS 287 
(b) In supporting its student activities. 
(c) In upholding the good name of the school. 
(4) To one’s city. 
(a) Intelligent and sympathetic interest in its problems 
and projects. Especially due from those educated in 
the city’s schools. 
(b) Problems peculiarly adapted to elicit interest and co- 
operation of young, as clean streets, cultivation of 
vacant lots, etc. 
(5) To one’s country. 
(a) Treatment of the flag. 
(b) The correct thing to do when our national hymns are 
sung. 
(c) Not closing our eyes to our national shortcomings. 
Not necessary to advertise those shortcomings. 
(d) The correct interpretation of “‘My country, right or 
wrong.” 
(e) Loyalty implies active support of public measures. 
(V) Industry. 
(1) Value of work. 
(a) In developing body and mind. 
(b) In keeping from wrong ways of acting and thinking. 
(2) Change of work, not cessation, often the best recreation. 
Value to the student of changing to out-of-door work 
or household tasks. 
(3) Industry is not merely being busy but implies concentra- 
tion. 
(a) Mental concentration most important to students. 
Cultivate oblivion of everything save task in hand. 
Importance of learning to study in study room. Pos- 
sible to gain absolute mental control. 
(6) Importance of methodical division of time so as to ap- 
proach the same task each day at the same time and 
also master the task within the allotted time. 
(4) Examples of industry and what has come of it. 
Edison, Roosevelt, etc. 
(5) Inspiration of feeling that one has a worthy share in world’s 
work. Excellent suggestions on the topic, especially 
in concentration, can be found in Arnold Bennett’s
-P-A-G-E-298
  288 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
How to Live on Twenty four Hours a Day and The 
Human Machine. 
(VI) Obedience — the accepting of rightful guidance. 
(1) Necessary to individual progress, which results from the 
one who knows, guiding the one who does not know. 
(2) Necessary to social progress. Certain principles of conduct 
and certain lines of procedure recognized as binding 
on all (customs and laws). From these result orderly 
communities where life and property are safe and social 
progress is possible. 
(3) School communities must submit to rules of guidance in 
order to accomplish their work. Picture a school 
where each does as he pleases. Rules should be 
equally binding on all. | 
(4) School officers, however, should not be looked upon as the 
makers and enforcers of rules, but as the regulators of 
school activities to the accomplishment of school tasks. 
(5) Self-government implies the intelligent recognition by the 
individual of the need for rules of conduct (school rules 
and society requirements) and the voluntary observ- 
ance of the same. Self-government is the finest 
manifestation of obedience.

(1) Be civil to Central. 
(2) Do not “visit” on the telephone. 
(3) Limit conversation to reasonable time. 
(4) Be careful of language used.

  CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 
TypicAL PROGRAMS 
HE following programs have been selected to illustrate 
the fundamental unity of purpose that underlies 
junior high school work in the United States and the manner 
in which the general program of studies, while expressing 
this unity of purpose, may be and is modified to meet local 
conditions. 
BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA 
Berkeley has four junior high schools. The programs 
followed by these schools are not uniform. The following 
three illustrate the manner in which the city varies the work 
of the junior high schools in order to meet the needs of vari- 
ous types and classes of pupils: !

Conspicuous features of the Pasadena program of studies 
are the following: 
(1) 
(2) 
(3) 
(4) 
(5) 
(6) 
  The differentiation of the seventh and eighth grade 
work into eight distinct curricula : 
(a) Manual arts (e) Language 
(6) Mechanical drawing (f) Science 
(c) Agriculture (g) Domestic science 
(d) Commercial (h) Art 
Pupils elect to pursue a given curriculum through- 
out the junior high school. 
Each curriculum differs from all the others in regard 
to prescribed subjects. Each curriculum also per- 
mits of electives: one, in the seventh grade; two, 
in the eighth; and three, or-more, in the ninth. 
All studies are pursued five periods a week, even 
such subjects as music, drawing, and shop work. 
One year of shop work is required of all boys before 
completing the eighth grade. 
No mathematics is prescribed for any pupil after 
the seventh grade.

  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
Choice of a modern language (French or Spanish) is 
given before an ancient language is studied; the 
choice being open to pupils of the seventh grade. 
Typewriting and allied commercial work are open 
to pupils in the commercial curriculum in the seventh 
grade. 
General science is an elective study, except for pupils 
in the science curriculum. 
The only required studies in the ninth grade are 
English and physical education. 
The project idea is in effect in the agricultural curric- 
ulum in the seventh grade, there being six projects 
definitely outlined, as follows: (a) home vegetable 
garden; (6b) egg production; (c) pigeons; (d) mar- 
ket garden; (e) rabbit raising; (f) flowers. 
Eleven elective studies are available in the seventh 
grade; fourteen in the eighth grade; and twenty- 
five in the ninth grade. 
Sixty minutes is the length of class periods in all 
studies in all grades.

Students preparing for a college which requires ancient history may sub- 
stitute ancient history for civics and general science in ninth grade. Students 
who make this substitution must select American history and civics in twelfth 
grade. 
Grand Rapids is often regarded as the second city, in point 
of time, to establish a junior high school. It is interesting, 
therefore, to compare its present program of studies with one 
in use at an earlier date. Since 1914, Grand Rapids has 
made the following changes: 
(1) Geography and history in seventh grade have been 
correlated. 
(2) Reading, as such, has disappeared from the curricu- 
lum. 
(3) Penmanship has taken a recognized place in the sev- 
enth and eighth grades.
-P-A-G-E-308
  298 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
(4) Music and art have each been expanded one hundred 
per cent. 
(5) Physical education is recognized. 
(6) Printing is given a correlative rank with manual 
training and may be pursued instead of it. 
(7) Algebra, English, civics (one half year), general sci- 
ence (one half year), and physical training are pre- 
scribed for all pupils in the ninth grade. 
(8) The total number of units pursued each week in the 
seventh and eighth grades is increased from twenty- 
one to twenty-six. 
Commenting upon this change, Superintendent Greeson 
remarked : 
The curriculum was adopted .. . for use in seventh, eighth, 
and ninth grades. ... You will observe that we are becoming 
more rigid as to electives in seventh, eighth, and ninth grades. We 
are driven to that position by observing the results of the stand- 
ardized tests in seventh, eighth, and ninth grades in buildings now 
organized on the departmental plan with the results obtained in 
buildings where each subject is taught by a special teacher and where 
a greater number of electives is allowed. 
JACKSON, MICHIGAN 
In 1914, the program of studies shown on page 299 was 
arranged by Superintendent Marsh for the intermediate 
schools of Jackson, Michigan. 
This tentative program had the following unique features : 
(1) The broad scope of range of offerings presented. 
(2) The degree of flexibility of administration provided. 
(3). The unusually large number of weekly recitation pe- 
riods (twenty-three to thirty-two permitted to pupils). 
(4) The granting of credit for special work, meaning 
thereby “special instruction out of school during the 
school term in vocal music, piano, violin, drawing, or 
painting.”

The introduction of a course in general science in the 
seventh grade. 
The prescription of two periods in physical training 
each year. 
The introduction of commercial work as early as the 
seventh grade. 
The introduction of elementary agriculture and 
poultry raising in the eighth grade — a particularly 
interesting innovation considering the fact that 
Jackson was a city of more than 40,000 population, 
and drew few pupils into the seventh grade from the 
country districts. 
In 1919, a new program was put into effect, as follows:

In the five years that had elapsed between the date of 
the first program and the second, experience, which alone 
gives wisdom in these matters, had caused the Jackson ad-

(1) English is now given seven periods a week in the seventh ~

  302 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
(2) General mathematics has taken the place of arith- 
metic in both these grades. 
(3) Elementary science is transferred from an elective 
study of the seventh grade to a required one in the 
eighth grade. 
(4) The units prescribed are five more in the seventh 
grade, and three more in the eighth and ninth grades. 
MENOMINEE, MICHIGAN 
The difference between the Menominee program of stud- 
ies and the program followed by Jackson are striking. Jack- 
son provides a wide range of studies in each grade and en- 
courages “browsing.”” Menominee offers few subjects and 
prescribes most of them.

Nott. The parent is asked to select one subject from two elective 
subjects in the seventh grade, one subject from three elective subjects in 
the eighth grade, and two subjects from six elective subjects in the ninth 
grade. If in doubt as to what subject your child should take, we 
recommend Mathematics and Science in the seventh and eighth grades. 
The following statement from the Menominee Bulletin 
also bears upon the program: 
LIBRARY INSTRUCTION 
A course of instruction throughout the junior and senior high 
school years is given by the high school librarian in connection with

planning to enter college. It aims to fit a girl for good homemaking and 
good citizenship. Emphasis is placed upon such work as Sewing, Cooking, 
Millinery, Household Management, and Art — Fine, Manual, or Com- 
mercial, but practical work in the academic branches of English, History, 
Mathematics, and Science is included. 
The course is designed further, to give girls a training upon which to 
base a choice for future vocation outside the home, or with proper electives, 
to enter a higher technical institution, if desired.

Manual arts and household arts, music and drawing 
are nominally elective in the seventh grade, but the 
list of electives is so limited that manual training 
(for boys) and household arts (for girls), together 
with either music or drawing, become virtually pre- 
scribed subjects. 
Algebra is a prescribed subject in the eighth grade. 
Latin is the only foreign language offered below the 
ninth grade. 
A wide range of elective subjects is provided in each 
curriculum of the ninth grade. 
DETROIT, MICHIGAN 
years ago, the educational system of Detroit was re- 
organized according to the six-six plan, and several large 
high schools were developed. After this plan had been in
-P-A-G-E-318
  308 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
operation for a number of years, the administrative staff 
came to the conclusion that the six-six plan was unsuitable 
for Detroit and that differentiated schools organized accord- 
ing to the junior high school plan would better serve the needs 
of the community. It was held that the old six-six plan 
had failed to adjust properly the position of the seventh and 
eighth-grade pupils, and it was pointed out that the pupils 
of this age, when grouped with large numbers of older boys 
and girls, either are lost to view in the general enrollment 
or by forming separate small groups automatically place 
themselves out of reach of the full current of the school’s 
socializing influence. 
Detroit, with characteristic energy and determination, 
then adopted the junior high school plan, segregating the 
intermediate grades and reorganizing the program of studies 
and the collateral activities pertaining to those grades in 
accordance with the best scientific theories and methods of 
secondary school education. Funds were voted to meet 
the material needs of reorganization and extensive building 
operations were begun. ‘Today, Detroit has one of the best 
educational systems in the United States and offers boys 
and girls of all types and classes educational opportunities 
that are almost perfect. 
Concerning the new policy, Charles L. Spain, deputy super- 
intendent, who is in charge of secondary education at De- 
troit, says: 
In September, 1919, the authorities in control of the Detroit 
school system adopted an educational policy which contemplates 
the ultimate segregation of the first six grades of the elementary 
schools in platoon schools, and the training of all pupils of the 
seventh, eighth, and ninth grades in large intermediate schools 
specifically organized to meet the educational needs of pupils of 
adolescent years. 
This far-reaching educational program, which is well on its way 
to realization, was inaugurated only after the most exhaustive 
 
-P-A-G-E-319
  TYPICAL PROGRAMS 309 
consideration and study on the part of those responsible for educa- 
tional leadership in the Detroit school system. It rests, we believe, 
on a sound educational philosophy. It embodies, in a concrete way, 
the results of the best experience and thought of the past, combined 
with the results of the latest studies and research in the fields of 
psychology, sociology, and school administration. The ideals which 
underlie this program are social rather than academic. It is con- 
ceived that education should be of that type which will best achieve 
the purposes of a democracy. This program is based upon the 
theory that “the purpose of democracy is so to organize society that 
each person may develop his personality primarily through activities 
designed for the well-being of his fellow members, and of society as 
a whole.” ... 
The program of studies as tentatively outlined for the Detroit 
intermediate schools is a socialized program. . . . It is designed 
to contribute to the great social objectives of education : 
(1) To provide for the present and future health of the pupil. 
(2) To continue training in the fundamental processes. 
(3) To train pupils in their social-civic duties—worthy home 
membership, citizenship, and ethical character. 
(4) To train future citizens to use their leisure time worthily. 
(5) To train pupils for vocational life. 
. . - While the social aims lie behind the entire program and 
organization of this school, certain features are specifically intended 
to realize these aims :° 
(1) The social sciences are made the core of the curriculum rather 
than the languages. This phase of instruction is emphasized 
throughout the three years. 
(¢) The auditorium periods are planned to bring the pupils to- 
gether under conditions which will make them conscious of 
their social relationships. 
(3) This school will give much attention to extra-curricular 
activities — clubs, societies, and various codperative groups. 
Boy scout work for boys and similar group work for girls, 
will play an important part. 
(4) Pupil participation in school activities and control will be 
encouraged. 
        
      
      
    
   
   The following program of studies shows the distribution

day, supervised study, semi-departmentalized teaching, and

  No differentiation is provided for in the seventh grade except in so far 
as offering shop work and mechanical drawing to the boys, and home eco- 
nomics to the girls constitutes differentiation. There are no electives in 
the seventh grade, but a wide variety of curricular experience is prescribed 
forall pupils. In vocational subjects this variety is greater in 7 A than in 7 B.

   In the eighth and ninth grades, the work is divided into four curricula. 
It is planned at the beginning of the eighth grade to begin a rough dif- 
ferentiation among pupils, upon the basis of work done in the seventh 
grade and upon the results of the study of each individual case by the 
educational and vocational counselor. Under guidance, the pupil is here 
allowed the choice of : : 
(1) A general curriculum, intended for pupils who will enter the 
senior high school. 
(2) A technical curriculum, designed for those boys who will probably 
proceed to the vocational high school or who will enter industry 
directly from the intermediate school. 
(3) A technical curriculum designed for girls who probably will not enter 
high school, but will go directly into industry. 
(4) A commercial curriculum designed for pupils who will probably be- 
come office workers. 
All the work in each curriculum is prescribed. There are no Anciivil 
within a curriculum, except that within the vocational subjects, a choice 
is allowed. The traditional subjects and health education are held constant, 
or nearly so, as in the case of mathematics, throughout all curricula, the 
chief variation coming in the vocational subjects and in the inclusion or 
omission of foreign languages. 
SmitH-HvuGHES CLASSES 
. The industrial curriculum conforms to the requirements necessary 
for receiving national and state aid under the Smith-Hughes law, and is 
for students : 
(1) Who are of such character as to be better able to profit by industrial 
work than by the regular work of grades seven, eight, and nine, 
whether or not they have finished the elementary work usually 
prescribed for entrance to the intermediate school. 
(2) Students who for various reasons may be able to remain only a short 
time in school and who need short, intensive courses of training 
before entering industry.

mately one third of the time is given to vocational work, while, in the general course, 
the vocational work is reduced to a minimum, and more time is given to the 
fundamentals and the languages. Every pupil who finishes the intermediate course 
will have had ample opportunity for training in English, history, civics, and mathe- 
matics; will have had time every day for physical development; will have had a 
brief contact with music, art, and general science, and will have had a liberal por- 
tion of time to try himself out vocationally. 
BUFFALO, NEW YORK 
Buffalo, like Detroit, has given great attention to the prob- 
lems of secondary education and has lately authorized the 
construction of twelve junior high school buildings of the 
most approved design. 
Concerning the educational policy of Buffalo in regard 
to these schools, Superintendent Hartwell says: 
It is the purpose so to locate the twelve junior high schools 
throughout the city that no pupil in the seventh, eighth, or ninth 
grades will reside more than a mile from the school. ( 
     
-P-A-G-E-323
  TYPICAL PROGRAMS 313 
The schools will operate on a two-session plan, having in mind 
that most of the pupils attending will go home for their midday meal. 
The schools will provide departmentalized work; promotion by 
subject rather than by grade; an adaptation of educational method 
to the special needs of adolescence; and an extensive program of 
pre-vocational training. Sixty minutes daily for every boy and girl 
in attendance will be allowed for physical education, including 
regular gymnasium work, games, physical examinations, and cor- 
rective exercises. ‘The physical development and progress of the 
pupils in these schools will receive the same careful attention that is 
given to their mental progress. 
There will be a vocational guidance department in each school, 
with a trained adviser for the boys and another for work with the 
girls. It is planned to have a wide variety of try-out courses to 
which the pupils of these schools will be exposed for the purpose of 
endeavoring to discover their natural tastes and aptitudes. 
Each classroom is a laboratory in itself. Classrooms are es- 
pecially designed for each subject with reference books, maps, and 
other necessary equipment immediately at hand. 
The dominating ideal and purpose of the school is to teach pupils 
how to study rather than to hear recitations. Home work will not 
be required, except possibly in the languages or in one or two 
electives in the ninth grade. 
The class period as now planned will be sixty minutes in length. 
A teacher may divide this time as she sees fit, and there will be no 
formal division into study and recitation periods. The purpose of 
each class period is to teach children how to prepare a lesson, and 
the purpose of the school is to provide an ideal environment in which 
the pupils, with their necessary equipment at hand and with an 
instructor intelligently to direct their work, may be given every 
possible assistance. 
Music will receive a larger place than it has hitherto been ac- 
corded. The music of the assembly period will be for the pleasure 
and joy that comes from singing. Special provision will be made for 
the musically inclined and the talented pupil. 
Thirty minutes daily will be allowed for an assembly period. 
his time will afford opportunity for community singing, general 
tudent activities, lectures, concerts, and demonstrations. Much 
f the assembly work will be under the direction of the pupils them- 
elves, who will thereby have an opportunity to develop responsi- 
      
         
                                              
       
    
   
-P-A-G-E-324
  314 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
bility in the organization of assembly programs. The assembly 
period will also afford the time for student club activities. 
No pupil in the seventh grade will have more than three book 
subjects a day, and no pupil in the eighth or ninth grades will have 
more than four. 
The school day for such a program as is contemplated will prob- 
ably be six and one half hours in length. Every pupil will be busy 
every one of the periods, three or four with academic subjects and 
the remainder of the day either in the laboratory, shop, studio, 
gymnasium, or commercial department. It is planned that each 
teacher shall have four classes a day with two free periods, in which 
time she will be expected to correct all papers and make systematic 
preparation for the next day’s work. When she leaves the building 
she will be through for the day. 
Regular school activities, such as debating, dramatization, glee 
club, orchestra, etc., will be amplified to the fullest possible extent, 
but all of these activities will be in connection with the regular 
daily work, not in addition or in interruption thereof.

The Duluth program contains the following interesting 
features : 
(1) There are two curricula from the outset — the aca- 
demic and the pre-vocational. 
(2) Freedom is given pupils to transfer from one curric- 
ulum to the other at the end of any semester. 
(3) The only electives open to seventh and eighth grade 
students in the academic course are French and 
Latin. 
(4) The only difference between the academic and pre- 
vocational curricula for either the seventh or eighth 
grade is the substitution of two shop courses each 
semester in the pre-vocational course for Latin or 
French in the academic. 
(5) No work in general science is offered, except a half- 
year course in the eighth grade of the pre-vocational 
curriculum. 
(6) European history constitutes the social science work 
of the ninth grade in both curricula.

SUMMARY 
A partial summary of the practices found in the eleven 
cities mentioned above for the seventh and eighth grades, 
shown on pages 324 and 325, gives the tables of subjects, 
with the periods allowed for each. 
PROPOSED PROGRAM OF STUDIES FOR JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS 
In the light of the practices and the recommendations 
respecting the program of studies as given above, it seems 
to the writer that the following offerings might very properly 
find place in the typical junior high school of fairly large 
size. In smaller systems adjustments and omissions should 
doubtless be made. 
I. Physical Training 
1. Health instruction 
2. Exercises, games, corrective work, etc. 
II. Composite English 
1. Oral discussions of topics lying within the interest 
and comprehension of pupils 
. Grammatical instruction and drill as the function- 
ing need arises 
. Classical and contemporary literature for class 
study 
. Classical and contemporary literature for personal 
pleasure and for outside reading 
. Written composition based on interests and inci- 
dents derived from the above-mentioned activities 
. Attention to spelling and writing as needs require 
. Dramatics, public speaking, and literary contests 
as occasions present themselves 
Ill. Mathematics 
1. Arithmetic relating to the home, business, industry, 
and recreation 
2. General mathematics IO Go -» OO w

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN 
ADMINISTRATION 
T has previously been asserted that the perfected jun- 
ior high school (as judged by present-day knowledge 
and experience) will consist of a body of pupils of from twelve 
to fifteen years of age, segregated in a separate building and 
presided over by a special staff; that it will provide a pro- 
gram of studies expanded greatly beyond the limits of the 
traditional seventh, eighth, and ninth grade offerings; that 
it will provide for the departmental organization of school 
work and the promotion of pupils by subjects rather than by 
grades; and that it will follow a well-outlined plan for super- 
vision of study, school and vocational guidance, and proper 
encouragement of student collateral activities. It remains 
to speak of these provisions more in detail and to indicate 
certain administrative practices that must needs be followed. 
In the first place, it is unwise for a community to attempt 
to reorganize its school system without making adequate 
preparation for so doing. Human nature is conservative. 
It is hostile to sudden and radical changes. Hence, no wise 
superintendent or principal will seek to force the reorganiza- 
tion of a school system at greater speed or in completer detail 
than his constituency considers advisable. In regard to 
this matter, H. P. Study of Neodesha, Kansas, after four 
years of experience in promoting, organizing, and adminis- 
tering a junior high school, says that he considers necessary 
the following preliminary steps: 
    (1) Self-preparation on the part of the junior high school or- 
ganizer or administrator himself. 
(2) The sharing of responsibility for the new movement with the 
school authorities. 
(3) Educating the public, giving publicity to the junior high 
school idea. 
328
-P-A-G-E-339
ADMINISTRATION 329 
(4) The selection of a corps of teachers who will constitute the 
very embodiment of the junior high school idea in thought 
and purpose. 
(5) Preliminary training of teachers in point of view and methods 
of procedure.! 
This is sound doctrine. 
RELATION BETWEEN THE JUNIOR AND SENIOR HIGH SCHOOLS 
In articulating a junior high school with the rest of the 
system, due care must be exercised. While it seems desira- 
ble to make the new school a unit by itself, it assuredly may 
not be treated as a wholly independent organization with no 
direct relation either to the grades above or the grades below. 
To permit such a plan to operate would be to invite weak- 
nesses not dissimilar to those that characterize the traditional 
organization. New “gaps” in the system would be opened 
at the end of the sixth and ninth grades; new tendencies to 
conduct school as an end in itself would be likely to develop ; 
new types of formalism would probably become established ; 
and the inspiration that comes to teachers and pupils from 
contact with other portions of the school system would be 
lost. 
On the other hand, to make the new school tributary to 
the senior high school — with senior high school aims pre- 
dominating below the tenth grade and determining the 
curricula for the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades; senior 
high school teachers shaping the policies, methods, and 
standards of the junior high school; and senior high school 
officers controlling, directing, and supervising the activities 
of the younger organization, as though possessed of a divine 
right — will destroy whatever advantages the junior high 
school possesses over the traditional school. 
1 “Preliminary Steps in Organizing a Junior High School,” Educational 
Administration and Supervision, Vol. 3, pages 339 et seq. 
 
-P-A-G-E-340
    330 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
The ideal plan is to have a principal and a separate staff 
of teachers for each school, the entire teaching force to act 
under the guidance of an elected council of teachers presided 
over by the superintendent of schools and the general ad- 
ministrative force. In no other way can the elementary 
school, the junior high school, and the senior high school be 
kept distinct and, at the same time, codperatively dependent. 
This plan, however, is operable only in school systems of 
fairly large size. In small school systems and in rural com- 
munities, it is impracticable to maintain fully differentiated 
elementary schools, junior high schools, and senior high schools. 
There, the six-six plan of organization is the more advan- 
tageous, and in the six-year high school but one group of 
administrative officials can or should be found. 
THE PROBLEM OF CREDITS 
Each school of an educational system should receive pupils 
from the school below and unhesitatingly give full faith and 
credit to their records as furnished by such lower school. 
Ordinarily, completion of the sixth grade in the elementary 
school should automatically promote a pupil to the junior 
high school. Likewise the completion of a given number 
and kind of units of work in the junior high school should 
operate to admit the pupil, with full credit, to the senior high 
school. In exceptional cases, promotions or demotions 
from one school to another should be made without regard 
to grades. 
6 facilitate these transfers, the junior high school and the 
senior high school should employ the same method of accred- 
iting the work of pupils. If semester courses be the stand- 
ard, then to the thirty-two credits usually required for 
graduation from the four-year high school should be added 
sixteen other credits to be gained in the seventh and eighth 
 
-P-A-G-E-341
    
    
     
ADMINISTRATION 331 
grades. Dividing the forty-eight credits thus obtained 
equally between the two schools would give twenty-four to 
each one. On the other hand, if units, or year courses, be 
the standard, the sum total to be earned in six years would 
equal twenty-four, of which twelve might properly be given 
by the junior high school and twelve by the senior high school. 
In either case, whether credits or units are adopted, the 
senior high school should arrange a three-year program, ac- 
cepting recommendations and credentials from the junior 
school at their full value, and making its own prescriptions 
relate solely to the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grades. 
The plan of allotting five periods a week to each and every 
subject finds no support in reform practice, in logic, or in 
wisdom. Certain subjects can best be treated in fewer than 
five class meetings a week; others may be scheduled oftener. 
The point or hour system of accrediting the work of pupils 
recognizes this fact and provides for the practical applica- 
tion of it. In the opinion of the present writer, it provides a 
far better method than either the unit or the semester credit 
systems referred to above. Under the point system, any 
subject requiring out-of-class preparation and taught once 
a week for a semester yields one point credit; if taught for 
two periods a week, it yields two points, or two hours, credit ; 
and so on. 
That the development of junior high schools is more or 
less dependent upon the encouragement afforded it by the 
senior high school, and that this encouragement will, to a 
considerable extent, be determined by the attitude of the 
colleges and universities in recognizing credits earned in the 
junior high school, seems very probable. That such encour- 
agement is, in places, being given to the reform movement 
is demonstrable. For illustration, consider the following 
resolutions passed by the Board of Regents of the Univer- 
sity of Michigan as early as 1914:
-P-A-G-E-342
  332 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
Resolved: 
(1) That school authorities be encouraged to incorporate the 
seventh and eighth grades of the elementary school as an integral 
part of the high school system, forming a six-year system. 
(2) That school authorities be recommended to organize the six- 
year high school system into a junior high school of three years and 
a senior high school of three years as soon as local conditions will 
admit. 
(3) That graduates of the six-year high school course be required 
to gain during the last three years, at least eight of the fifteen units 
required for admission, two of which units shall be obtained during 
the senior year. 
(4) That graduates of six-year high school courses be permitted 
to apply for university credit on examination. 
Since, in accordance with these resolutions, seven of the 
fifteen units required for admission may be gained below the 
tenth grade, and since four units are ordinarily gained in 
the ninth grade, it appears that the University of Michigan 
has agreed to accept for admission three units gained in the 
seventh and eighth grades. 
The University of Chicago has adopted a different method 
of dealing with credits gained in the six-year system. This 
University accepts work done in the junior high school pro- 
vided it has previously been accepted and tested by the 
authorities of the senior high school. 
The North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary 
Schools follows, in general, the University of Chicago plan. 
Nevertheless, the articulation of the junior high school 
with the senior high school is not perfect, and as yet the ad- 
justment of credits earned in the two schools does not rest 
on a wholly satisfactory basis. If pupils in the junior high 
school are to be permitted to pursue more than four subjects, 
or twenty hours of classroom work, each year, then it is evi- 
dent that a pupil may finish the lower school and enter the 
upper school with considerably more than twelve units, or
-P-A-G-E-343

sixty points, of credit. The question is: What recognition 
should the senior high school give to the extra units or points 
gained in the school below? If full credit is allowed, pupils 
who have earned extra credits will be in a position to com- 
plete the senior high school work and be ready for gradua- 
tion in two and one half, two, or even one and one half years 
after leaving the junior high school. Arthur Gould, Assistant 
Superintendent of Los Angeles schools, writing in the School 
Review, June, 1920, presents a table showing the scope of the 
problem. Of 564 pupils who completed the Los Angeles 
junior high school course in 1919, 63 per cent had earned 
enough credits to enter the tenth grade B. This of course 
is the normal, natural advancement. But 27 per cent en- 
tered the tenth grade A, and one pupil was admitted to the 
eleventh grade B. A like condition prevails in Detroit and, 
no doubt, in other large cities that have junior high schools. 
Respecting this situation, Mr. Gould says: 
Perhaps more serious than all the other disadvantages of giving 
advance credit has been the effect upon the educational ideals of the 
pupils. They have felt that it is the purpose of the junior high 
school to hurry them through their school career. This has come 
about in a perfectly natural manner, since progress in the senior 
high schools is measured by credits and senior high school subjects 
have been given, as far as possible, in the junior high school. Meas- 
urement of progress in senior high school subjects studied in the 
junior high schools by credits has followed.! 
Three courses suggest themselves. One is not to allow any 
advance credit whatever for work done in the junior high 
school; another is to allow definite partial credit; and a 
third is to adjust credits on an individual basis, thus per- 
mitting each pupil to acquire as many points as he can earn 
and to complete his senior high school course in three addi- 
tional years (or less) as his ability and efforts determine.

    334 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
Of course the attitude of the colleges and universities has 
much to do with the problem. As before stated, some uni- 
versities have already adopted liberal policies respecting the 
matter; others have not. In the estimation of Professor 
Judd, a stanch advocate of the junior high school, the chief 
reason for the slow development of the reforms in secondary 
education is the obstructive policy of high school and college 
men in respect to this very point. Neither group seems will- 
ing to depart from tradition. The high school men, for the 
most part, wish to control completely the four years’ work 
that has heretofore been under their domination, and are not 
willing to allow the ninth grade work to be reorganized, nor 
do they wish to give high school credit for more than a small 
fraction of the work done in the seventh and eighth grades of 
the junior high school. Similarly, the colleges, for the most 
part, have refused or neglected to adopt liberal measures. 
That both high school and college men are disposed not 
to give any great amount of independence to the junior high 
school or to restrict their own spheres of action to the three 
upper grades is revealed by two resolutions presented at a 
conference of members of the North Central Association in 
March, 1922. The two resolutions were offered, in turn, by 
Professor Judd. The first one reads: 
Resolved : 
That this Conference recommend to the North Central Associa- 
tion that the colleges of the Association be urged to develop as 
soon as possible a plan of admission that will give official recognition 
to the work done in the seventh and eighth grades.! 
This resolution failed. The second resolution reads: 
Resolved: 
That this Conference recommend to the North Central Associa- 
tion that the colleges be requested to rewrite their entrance re- 
quirements so as to require not more than twelve units to be com- 
pleted in grades ten, eleven, and twelve. 
1 Proceedings of the North Central Association, Part I, page 60, 1922. 
 
-P-A-G-E-345
    ADMINISTRATION 335 
This resolution, too, was voted down. 
Despite the action or non-action of high schools, colleges, 
and other standardizing agencies, the evidence shows that 
the day is not far away when the more liberal principles sug- 
gested by Dr. Judd’s resolutions must prevail. 
For the most part, in the recent past, whatever credit has 
been allowed by the senior high school for work pursued in 
the junior high school has been granted ona 1:2 basis. That 
is, only half credit has been given for any course pursued in 
the seventh or eighth grades — and then only for certain 
specified kinds of work, such as language, general mathe- 
matics, or commercial branches. In several instances, only 
one third credit has been granted, and this on the under- 
standing that the subject has been pursued throughout three 
semesters and frequently with the further proviso that one 
of these semesters must lie within the ninth grade. ‘This, 
until very recently, was the custom at Los Angeles. 
The reasons commonly advanced for thus reducing the 
term credits of the first and second years of the junior high 
school have been that these two grades represent a transition 
period in school work; that the pupils are immature and in- 
capable of independent study; that less material is covered 
than in the upper grades and that consequently the educa- 
tional values derived from the courses must be less. 
A third factor that has often entered into the problems of 
adjustment and increased the difficulties of their solution 
is the practice in many cities of retaining the old-type eight- 
year elementary school and the four-year high school, while 
at the same time seeking to develop the entire system on 
the six-three-three plan of organization. Pupils who com- 
plete one of these older elementary schools and enter the ninth 
grade of the four-year high school must later be grouped with 
pupils who completed their ninth grade work in the junior 
high school. To unify the work of the ninth grade in both 
schools is not an easy matter.
-P-A-G-E-346
  336 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
But order is gradually coming out of the confusion. The 
old ideas concerning credits are giving way, and it seems 
likely that the probable outcome will be a plan to consider 
the points gained during the six years of the secondary school 
in the aggregate, to fix the number of points to be gained in 
the junior high school, and to prescribe a given number of 
points for graduation from the senior high school; or, as 
an alternative, to consider the junior high school complete 
in itself, to grant no advance credit for work done in it, and 
to base graduation from the senior high school solely upon 
the credits earned in the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grades. 
Boston has recently adopted the first plan; Los Angeles 
and Cleveland, the second. The Boston plan is described 
thus : 
The 100-Point Diploma Plan 
Since the period of secondary school instruction has been length- 
ened by the inclusion of grades seven and eight, it has seemed 
desirable to increase correspondingly the number of points accredited 
for the high school diploma. As, however, grades seven and eight 
constitute, as it were, a transition period in which some of the work 
can hardly be considered as on a par with the work of the later 
years, it has seemed best to regard the secondary school period as 
consisting of five units instead of six, grades seven and eight to- 
gether forming the first unit. The normal number of points to be 
gained in each unit is twenty. This plan has been modified some- 
what as will appear below. 
When the 100-point diploma plan was adopted, it seemed wise 
to assign twenty points as the normal credit for the work of grades 
seven and eight combined, and 20 points to each of the following 
years. It was the expectation that the work of the two years 
would be considered as a unit and that credits for the work would 
be recorded only at the end of grade eight. The original plan has 
been modified to the extent of assigning twenty-one points for the 
work of these two grades in order to give certain pupils a better 
chance of promotion, and also by recognizing the principle that 
credit should be given for all work successfully accomplished. 
Under the old plan the pupil might pass in the work of grade seven 
 
-P-A-G-E-347
  
ADMINISTRATION 337 
and fail in that of grade eight. In the vast majority of cases he 
would thus lose all credit for the work of the two years in that par- 
ticular subject. The good work of grade seven counted for nothing. 
If, however, credit is to be given for work wherever done, it becomes 
necessary to assign a definite number of points for the work of each 
particular subject in each of the two grades, seven and eight. The 
total number of credits has been divided, ten and one-half points 
being assigned to each of the two years.! 
The Los Angeles plan has been described by Miss Helen 
S. Watson, Assistant Superintendent of Los Angeles schools. 
When our junior high schools were organized there was the 
feeling that we should shorten the high school course by making 
high school credits in the junior high school. This we have found 
unsatisfactory, and, beginning with February of next year, we have 
graduation from the regular junior high school course. Ordinarily 
this is three years in length, but it may be completed in two and 
one half years if the child is bright. The graduates of our junior 
high schools will then enter the B 10 class and will have before them 
a three-year high school course which may be shortened by the 
super-bright child. ... For many pupils who are super-bright 
we believe in enriching the curriculum rather than shortening the 
course.” 
The Bulletin issued by the Cleveland authorities in 1922 
contains the following: 
No work is carried in the junior high school with the view of 
senior high school credit. All work done in the junior high school is 
done for junior high credit. The junior high school covers the work 
of the seventh, eighth, and ninth years, and while some subjects 
formerly taught only in the senior high school are begun in the 
junior high school, they are regarded as meeting the requirements 
set up for the seventh, eighth, and ninth years. Acceleration is 
provided by sectioning the pupils upon the basis of ability.* 
The Los Angeles and Cleveland plan is in accordance with 
the resolutions presented at the North Central Association

  338 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
meeting in 1922. Probably the best solution of the whole 
difficulty lies in the general adoption of this plan. 
WEEKLY CLASS PERIODS 
What should be the standard in regard to the number of 
weekly class periods that pupils should be permitted, or re- 
quired, to undertake is, as yet, an unanswered question. 
Practices range from twenty periods, or less, in America to 
thirty-three, or more, in certain European schools. All 
depends upon the character of the work undertaken and the 
strength and ambition of the pupil. With a wide range of 
impressional and expressional subjects, and of studies re- 
quiring much outside preparation alternating with others 
requiring little preparation, it seems reasonable to believe 
that the number of weekly periods may safely be increased 
considerably beyond the old high school standard of twenty. 
Moreover, if credit be allowed for various kinds of general 
courses, such as auditorium exercises and chorus, glee, and 
orchestra work; and for activities that are essentially de- 
signed to develop habits of volitional response, such as ath- 
letics, club work, debating, and managerial positions con- 
nected with the school paper, the cafeteria, the commercial 
offices, and like projects; then, certainly, the number of 
weekly periods may properly be extended to thirty, thirty- 
five, or more. To have each hour of the school day fully 
accounted for seems to be desirable, and to give credit for 
each hour’s activity is a wise course to pursue. 
NUMBER AND LENGTH OF PERIODS IN SCHOOL DAY 
The number of periods in the ideal school day and the 
length of each period are points that are still unsettled. If 
the school makes provision for a variety of activities — 
intellectual, emotional, and volitional — then a long school 
day is not only defensible but desirable. Nothing is more 
 
-P-A-G-E-349
ADMINISTRATION 339 
destructive of physical, mental, and moral well-being than 
idleness, unregulated practices, and indiscriminate associa- 
tions. If today the proud boast of America is that it sends 
the “whole boy”’ to school, then the “whole boy”’ needs to 
be educated. For the accomplishment of this purpose, not 
only a series of years, but a relatively long school day through- 
out those years, will be needed. 
The accepted norm for the duration of class periods in the 
traditional high school is forty minutes. In the elementary 
school, periods range from ten minutes to thirty-five. But 
of late, in many places, it has been held that the most eco- 
nomical, suitable, and effective class period is one of sixty 
minutes. Such periods permit of ample time for lesson 
assignments, lesson study under supervision, and lesson dis- 
cussions and testings. A longer period tends to invite waste 
of efforts; a shorter period tends to hurry the procedure, to 
embarrass the teacher and pupils alike, and thus to render 
the lesson incomplete and ineffective. 
SUPERVISION OF STUDY 
Few pupils know how to study effectively. Teaching 
pupils how to study is, therefore, one of the duties — if not 
the chief duty — of teachers. It must be acknowledged, 
however, that it is a duty that is seldom well performed. 
Various schemes for the supervision of study have been 
proposed. The large study hall, the after school conference, 
the unprepared recitation period, the divided class period, 
the double period, and other plans have been tried. Each 
has its merits and defects. That the junior high school 
years are most appropriate ones in which to carry on sys- 
tematic supervised study seems to be the consensus of opin- 
ion. But that equal stress should be given to the super- 
vision of study in all types of school work, throughout each 
of the three years of the junior high school, seems both un- 
   
-P-A-G-E-350
  340 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
necessary and unwise. Certainly, to assume that a daily or 
weekly scheme of supervised study must extend throughout 
the entire six years of the reorganized secondary school is 
absurd. Pupils should be expected and required to advance 
independently and alone. Supervision of study should there- 
fore be progressively diminished. Nevertheless, the junior 
high school period must be regarded as the period par ezxcel- 
lence for teaching pupils how to study. The chief difficulty 
is that teachers either do not know how to teach pupils to 
study or, knowing how, fail to put their knowledge into 
practice. The danger lies in suggesting too much or too 
little, in carrying most of the burden for the pupil or in 
carrying none. 
Moreover, wherever supervised study is provided it is 
questionable whether teachers ought, in most instances, to 
be required to devote definite set portions of the class period 
to the task. In lieu thereof it seems wiser ordinarily to 
permit each one to utilize the class meeting as the circum- 
stances of the occasion suggest. Certainly the two most 
serious faults to be found among American teachers are 
the failure to knit the entire mass of the day’s thought 
material into a compact unity before dismissing it from | 
mind, and, second, the failure to make the new lesson assign- 
ment clear, definite, and truly vital. Classroom recitations 
and discussions are necessarily fragmentary, disjointed, and 
unsystematized. It is, however, the chief function of the 
teacher to bring order and permanency of form out of the 
chaos of impressions, ideas, and responses. In the ideal 
recitation period each pupil contributes his quota of knowl- 
edge, suggestion, interpretation, opinion, and thought, and 
shares with his fellows and with the teacher the responsibility 
of developing the topic that is before them — of clarifying 
the problem that is involved and of advancing it steadily 
to the point of solution. It is the business of the teacher 
 
-P-A-G-E-351
  
ADMINISTRATION 341 
not only to guide and direct the class activities, but also to 
supplement, illustrate, expound, and, above all else, to 
unify. Hence the need for systematic summarizing of ac- 
complishments in each class period is apparent. 
In like manner, ample time should be taken for assigning 
the new lesson. How many minutes should be devoted to 
this part of the work the particular circumstances of the 
hour must determine. Rarely is enough time or attention 
given to the task. Moreover, it is certain that the greater 
the thought and care that are employed in this manner, 
the less labored and more satisfactory will be the recitation 
work which follows later. Vague, generalized, formal assign- 
ments of lessons stamp the teacher as inefficient more posi- 
tively, perhaps, than any other one test of merit. Yet the 
fault is fairly common among all teachers. Instead of 
imitating the successful business man who advertises his 
goods, makes his show windows attractive, and draws 
custom by the sheer force of stimulated curiosity, teachers 
are prone to let the material for study lie embedded in dull 
textbooks, unmarked by any distinguishing placard, and 
undiscoverable except as blind chance leads the pupil to 
begin scratching the surface about it. In consequence of 
this unpedagogical mode of procedure pupils not infre- 
quently come away from classes with little notion of what 
the real problem is which is set them, wherein lie the most 
significant aspects of it, what difficulties of attack beset 
them, and how they should most effectively proceed to 
master the work. The result is unintelligent effort, waste 
of time, and moral discouragement on the part of many 
pupils. A further result is failure to comprehend the 
thought in class the following day, lack of responsiveness, 
irritation with the teacher, growing dislike for, and indiffer- 
ence to, school work in general, and finally withdrawal from 
further attempts at any systematic education. It is certain       
      
-P-A-G-E-352

          that pupils frequently have failed to meet the standards be- 
cause they have not known clearly what was expected of 
them, nor how to proceed to the undertaking. No pattern 
was set before them, no device for whetting the interest was 
employed with them, no motive for exerting their best efforts 
was instilled into them. They merely failed in their tasks 
because others who were supposed to know what was best to 
do had failed in their tasks. 
DEPARTMENTAL INSTRUCTION 
Although there are educators who do not favor the de- 
partmentalization of instruction in the junior high school, the 
great majority approve of it. To most junior high school 
advocates it is, indeed, an essential part of the junior 
high school plan. It would, however, be very unwise to 
make a sudden change in a school system working under 
the old plan and to attempt departmentalization overnight. 
Teachers and pupils alike need to be prepared for such an 
innovation, and the best way of accomplishing the change is 
to proceed slowly, offering a certain amount of departmental 
teaching in the seventh grade, a larger amount in the eighth 
grade, and still more in the ninth. After these changes have 
become established and teachers and pupils have accustomed 
themselves to the new routine, the departmentalization may 
be continued until it is complete. 
In this connection, the following remarks contained in a 
circular issued by A. M. Cotter of the Condon Intermediate 
School at Detroit are interesting : 
Our Intermediate School curriculum provides for six clock hours 
per day, with each pupil assigned to some definite classroom for 
each of the thirty hours per week; thus doing away with the dif- 
ficulties of the study hall, and substituting in its place a combination 
of supervised study and recitation. ‘Twenty minutes is devoted
-P-A-G-E-353
  ADMINISTRATION 343 
recitation, ten minutes to assignment of new lesson, and thirty 
minutes to supervised study. 
To meet the common objection to the Intermediate School, that 
pupils are launched into a departmental system too suddenly and 
that they need the supervision of the ““home-room” teacher, we 
assign pupils during the seventh grade to one teacher in the two 
content subjects, English and history; thus each pupil spends one 
third of his time with one teacher, and that teacher can advise 
wisely his particular group of pupils when the time comes for their 
election of courses. 
Besides the opportunity of election of courses, we further provide 
for individual differences by promotion by subject, and by grouping 
pupils into homogeneous groups according to their abilities as 
indicated by a psychological test. 
The plan of having a single teacher act as a “clearing 
house” to facilitate departmentalization is advocated by 
J. A. Starkweather of Duluth, who says: 
One of the greatest difficulties which arises in the establishing of 
the junior high school is the change from one teacher to several 
teachers. This difficulty can be overcome by requiring each teacher 
in the junior high school to be able to teach at least three of the 
junior high school subjects and by making a provision that each 
teacher shall act as a “‘mother teacher” to a definite group of stu- 
dents. This means that she looks after their attendance, their 
absence, their tardiness, that she checks up their report cards, and 
is interested in their daily progress. Other classroom teachers 
report to this teacher the difficulties of these students and an attempt 
is made to make her the “clearing house” for adjusting difficulties 
between a pupil and his teachers. 
ELECTIVE STUDIES 
      
    Experience seems to indicate that the work of the seventh 
grade may be made nearly uniform for all types of pupils, 
and that such differentiation as is to be allowed can best be 
provided for by means of a group of optional or elective 
studies. The question whether the needs of pupils above the
-P-A-G-E-354
  344 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
seventh grade can best be met by providing a series of fixed 
curricula or a combination of prescribed studies and free 
electives, is one that depends to a large extent upon local 
conditions. No doubt the essential features of both modes 
of administration can properly be employed. A plan which 
is being successfully followed by many junior high schools 
lays down positive prescriptions which all pupils are ex- 
pected to meet, together with classified lists of optional or 
elective studies from which pupils may make selections, and 
a series of definitely formulated curricula intended to lead 
pupils toward certain goals. 
In order that the curricula and the groupings of prescribed 
and elective subjects may be wisely arranged, when this 
plan is followed, two positive practices should be encouraged : 
first, the entire teaching staff within a given school system 
should be constantly at work, through standing committees 
of teachers, revising the subject matter that enters into the 
several courses and curricula; and, second, an active, 
capable body of counselors should be ready to guide indi- 
vidual pupils in the selection of courses. 
The most nearly perfect plan of guidance is one which re- 
quires a committee report that deals with each pupil sepa- 
rately. In arriving at the judgment to be followed, the 
views and recommendations of at least four persons should 
be considered: the pupil, a parent, the grade teacher in 
charge of the pupil’s home room, and the principal of the 
school. 
An interesting list of elective studies arranged in the order 
of their prominence has been compiled by a well-known jun- 
ior high school administrator, H. F. Carmichael of Decatur, 
Illinois. In the compilation of this list, reports from twenty- 
four systems were used with the following result :!

             The wisdom of having separate classes for boys and girls 
in certain subjects has not yet been proved. There is, how- 
ever, much to be said in favor of such a plan. For example, 
the idea of providing separate sections for boys and girls in 
eighth-grade arithmetic offers many advantages. Under 
such an arrangement, boys could be given instruction in 
problems that relate specifically to boys’ interests or to in- 
terests that boys will be apt to follow later. Similarly, the 
work for girls might be made to center in the problems of 
the home. Classes in drawing and design lend themselves 
to the same kind of arrangement. As for the segregation of 
pupils in study or session rooms, that has been practiced in 
certain cities for years. 
Certain school systems have recently adopted the plan 
of complete segregation of boys and girls in separate school 
buildings from the seventh grade through the senior high 
school. Highland Park, Michigan, follows this plan. While 
at present, the school authorities, parents, teachers, and 
pupils in general seem to approve of the arrangement, the 
practice is perhaps too new: to permit us to judge of its 
advantages. 
On the other hand, Detroit segregates boys and girls 
throughout the six upper grades in “Home Rooms” or 
“‘Houses.”” Appropriate names are selected for these, as, 
for example, “The Webster House,” “The Roosevelt House,” 
“The Frances E. Willard House,” and “‘The Alice Freeman 
Palmer House.” Within these “Houses,” a single session- 
room teacher presides, “House” organizations are estab- 
lished, and “House” loyalties and interests are fostered. 
Which of these is the better plan, time alone will tell. 
_ One other type of segregation calls for consideration. If, 
‘as has been recommended, pupils are to be admitted to the

junior high school whenever in the judgment of the school 
authorities they can profit most therefrom, irrespective of 
the grade in which they are found, then for certain backward 
pupils some form of ‘“‘ungraded”’ or “special’”’ room should 
be provided. 
       
                          
    
     
    METHODS OF TEACHING 
The details of the best methods to be followed in the teach- 
ing of the several subjects of study provided in the junior 
high school have not yet been scientifically determined. 
That the methods need to be different from those com- 
monly employed in the grades below and the grades above 
has been acknowledged ever since the junior high school 
movement began. At the present moment, it seems clear 
that those methods will succeed best which employ much 
concrete material made vital and significant to pupils by 
means of interpretations that relate it to their own experience. 
To teach any subject in the junior high school in a formal, 
uninteresting manner is to invite failure. This school has 
been inspired by the recognition of the needs of boys and 
girls as boys and girls; hence, the methods employed must 
make an appeal to youthful interests. 
QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS 
_ What shall be the qualifications demanded of teachers in 
the junior high school is likewise a question that calls for 
careful consideration. There is no reason why teachers of 
departmentalized seventh and eighth grades should not pos- 
sess as thorough a training as the teachers of other grades 
of the high school. 
As a matter of fact, none but the teacher who is a fair 
master of the subject matter she teaches and who can grasp 
it in its entirety and diversity and skillfully relate it to the 
life experiences of young pupils, should be put in charge o
-P-A-G-E-359
  ADMINISTRATION 349 
these grades. In education it matters little how the finish- 
ing touches are given to a pupil’s development; but the 
foundation is all important. The task of introducing pu- 
pils for the first time to new lines of thought calls for the 
highest skill, as most college presidents and school superin- 
tendents and principals can testify. A beginner, perfect, 
it may be, in the knowledge of the subject to be taught, but 
ignorant of the deeper meanings of life and life’s relations, 
will serve the cause of education better if put in charge of 
advanced, rather than junior high school courses. 
This does not mean that no inexperienced teachers shall 
be employed in the junior high school. Such individuals, 
provided they possess personal qualities of high merit, and 
have pursued courses of study that have given them an in- 
sight into the educational problems met with in the junior 
high school, may, because of their enthusiasm, ambition, 
and recent school experience, prove most inspiring teachers. 
Faithful teachers previously employed in the seventh and 
eighth grades of the traditional school should not be trans- 
ferred, against their will, to other divisions of the school 
system, provided they possess qualities that fit them for 
work in the junior high school and can meet the necessary 
standards of scholarship and training. 
It stands to reason that ample time and opportunity to 
adjust their methods and experience to the requirements of 
the new school should be given to all teachers who have 
taught, and who desire to continue teaching, seventh and 
eighth grade pupils. 
On the other hand, for teachers who are temperamentally 
unfitted for departmental work, or who prefer to continue 
in undepartmentalized rooms, transfers should be arranged. 
In certain forms of organized activity, changes of system 
are apt to create some hardships; but in the public schools 
‘of America, where all teachers have equal standing, the
-P-A-G-E-360
  350 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
chances of doing individual teachers an injustice by merely 
modifying or altering the work of the schools are reduced to 
the minimum. However, in any case, the schools exist 
for the pupils, not for the teachers and administrators. 
There is indeed no logical reason for discrimination any- 
where in the school system, merely because of the grade of 
work being taught. The policy of requiring teachers to 
assume charge of classes in various grades — from the sev- 
enth to the twelfth — helps to break down false notions of 
superiority where such false and snobbish notions exist. 
GRADUATION EXERCISES 
The plan of conducting graduating exercises at the com- 
pletion of the ninth-grade work is thought by many persons 
to be unwise. The custom is a survival, so it is alleged, of a 
practice which had some justification at a time when few 
expected to continue their schooling beyond the eighth grade. 
Today the operation of the compulsory school law makes 
the custom unnecessary. To perpetuate it is to support the 
idea that the completion of the work of the ninth grade marks 
a natural stopping point in schooling. The effect of such 
exercises is likely, therefore, to be diametrically opposed to 
the spirit that has produced the junior high school. Certi- 
ficates indicating the completion of the elementary course 
may with full propriety be issued at this time, but public 
graduation exercises can most wisely be eliminated entirely 
until the senior high school course has been finished. 
If, however, the junior high school is to be regarded as a dis- 
tinct unit in the school system, some simple recognition of the 
fact is not out of place. The exercises need not be elaborate, 
nor need the idea of having finished school be overempha- 
sized. Youths, as we have seen, love ceremonies. More- 
over, properly organized graduation exercises are as likely to °
-P-A-G-E-361
  ADMINISTRATION 351 
inspire pupils to go on to the senior high school as to deter 
them from it. 
COSTS 
All the statistics available tend to show that while the 
junior high school, as a rule, costs somewhat more than the 
elementary schools in the same system, it costs less than the 
senior high school. Hence what is added in one place is 
subtracted in another. Moreover, if a community sows 
sparingly, it must expect to reap sparingly. The junior 
high school costs very little more than the traditional type 
of school, and it is worth whatever it costs. 
CONCLUSION 
How educators generally are viewing the questions of ad- 
ministration can perhaps be seen from the following study. 
In 1922, J. M. Glass, acting for a committee appointed 
by the National Council of Education, submitted a series 
of questions on the junior high school to a selected group 
of educational leaders. Sixty-four replied. Of these thirty- 
one were superintendents, twenty-four were junior high 
school principals, and nine were university men who had — 
studied the matter of school reorganization. Some of the 
more significant questions, together with the replies, ex- 
pressed in percentages, follow :!

CHAPTER NINETEEN 
COLLATERAL ACTIVITIES 
VERY junior high school should make adequate pro- 
vision for collateral activities in the fields of art, music, 
oratory, dramatic art, athletics, social recreations, and com- 
munity service. General student organizations should be 
fostered and protected and the growth of helpful clubs en- 
couraged. There are a thousand and one things of the ut- 
most importance for a successful life that can only be learned 
by being an active member of a well-organized social group. 
If the school is to help its pupils to live the kind of lives that 
- American democracy requires, it must make provision for 
outside activities in which the relations of the individual to 
society, and of society to the individual, may be learned 
at first hand. What a pupil needs is an opportunity to test 
his capacities in various ways and, after discovering his true 
interests, a chance to select and pursue activities that har- 
monize with his tastes and abilities. 
The keynote of democracy is equality of opportunity, 
not equality in achievement. It is quite as essential for 
pupils to learn that they are not qualified for certain kinds 
of work and play as it is for them to learn that they possess 
peculiar abilities in other lines of endeavor. Hence, to re- 
duce discouragement and, likewise, to counterbalance the 
spirit of personal egotism, a sufficient array of student col- 
lateral activities should be provided in every school to give 
each boy (and girl) a chance to win reasonable distinction in 
at least one line, and to reveal to his fellow students that he, 
too, has special aptitudes. Moreover, if organizations can 
be conducted with the idea that club welfare and honors 
should be paramount to personal advantage, a second great 
lesson will have been learned, that “he profits most who 
353        
    
-P-A-G-E-364
  354 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
serves best.”” When the idea becomes established that he 
is worthy of credit and honor who, by faithful service, adds 
but one point to the sum total of his club’s score; then will 
a new incentive have been implanted in youthful hearts and 
a new spirit developed in school life. 
GENERAL ASSEMBLY 
The school assembly plays an important part in the social 
life of the school. In general, the assembly should afford 
the whole school an opportunity to consider and to discuss 
in as informal a manner as possible, matters of vital interest 
to the school. Musicales furnished by members of the 
faculty and pupils, and lectures and addresses on appropriate 
subjects should be given from time to time. 
The place which is being assigned to the auditorium or 
assembly activities is interestingly revealed by the following 
account of the plan in operation in the Condon Intermediate 
School, Detroit : 
The last side of child nature to receive recognition and a proper 
opportunity for training and development has been the spiritual 
side, the side that means culture and ideals. With this slowly 
awakening sense has come the establishment of various means for 
socializing education, chief among which ranks the auditorium, 
and the work which can be done by this agency. Here the child 
should be given an opportunity to find out that the facts he is 
assimilating in classrooms are not mere dry, unrelated exercises, 
totally outside of his daily life. The auditorium should open to 
him the doors of a world of cultural beauty, the keys to which the 
classroom has put into his hands, but which his daily life and 
environment too often prevent him from entering or even 
approaching. 
Therefore, the auditorium should be the place in our educational 
system where children learn to be social beings, to make the most 
of themselves and to codperate with others in making the most of 
themselves. It should be a sort of clearing house for all the other 
branches of the school world, a focus of knowledge and activity, 
 
-P-A-G-E-365
  
COLLATERAL ACTIVITIES 355 
and a source from which should come desire for further knowledge 
and ability to use well in life the knowledge already acquired. 
Many of these pupils come from pitifully poor, overcrowded 
homes. They live in an atmosphere of dirt, disease, hurry, and 
worry; their highest form of amusement is a cheap movie-house 
or dance hall. They have no books or pictures at home; many 
of them know nothing of books except the few that are forced 
upon them at school, and nothing at all of good music or pictures. 
The auditorium ought to present to these crippled spirits the re- 
sources of a great city along the lines of literature, art, and music. 
It ought to substitute for cheap and shoddy amusement the finer, 
better things which are just as easy to attain. Good books, good 
pictures, and good music ought to be the inalienable right and 
privilege of every American child.! 
COMMUNITY SERVICE 
Many schools have shown that it is possible for their pupils 
to participate in various forms of social service to the com- 
munity. Such opportunities are embraced by the pupils, 
young reformers and missionaries that they are, with great 
eagerness. Settlement work is valuable because it brings 
pupils into sympathetic contact with society at large; but 
boys and girls of junior high school age should not be brought 
too often into contact with misery and wretchedness. School 
work is a sufficient tax upon the energies of most pupils, and 
nothing that is too difficult or emotionally exhausting should 
be permitted in this or any other of the collateral activities 
sanctioned by the school officers. Occasionally, funds ob- 
tained by means of dramatic and musical entertainments 
may be devoted to charitable works. For any and all kinds 
of community service requiring a financial outlay, it is better 
to use a fund derived from a united effort on the part of the 
whole school to earn the money rather than a fund consisting 
of the monetary contributions of individual students.

356 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
STUDENT SELF-GOVERNMENT 
Rarely, indeed, it would seem, should elaborate schemes 
of student government be encouraged in the junior high 
school. Pupils are too immature at that stage of life to 
take complete responsibilities in weighty matters of school 
direction. Nevertheless, some power of self-government 
should certainly be delegated to them. Only as beginnings 
in group control are made in the school will the primary 
purpose of public education be realized. Student councils, 
authorized to discuss topics relating specifically to student 
group interests, and invited to advise freely with the legally 
constituted authorities in the school respecting the adminis- 
tration thereof, will do much to produce a spirit of co- 
operation and a sense of group responsibility throughout 
the entire student body. Moreover, such participation 
gives excellent training for the active affairs as citizens 
when adult life is reached. 
Speaking on the general topic “‘Self-government, a Phase 
of Intermediate School Organization,” Deputy Superin- 
tendent Charles Spain of Detroit expresses himself thus: 
         
                     
     
                      
   Some scheme of student self-government should play an im- 
portant part in this program. It is not meant to imply by the 
term student self-government that any school, intermediate or 
high, has ever had or ever should have complete and actual self- 
government. The responsibility for the discipline and organiza- 
tion of a school rests upon the administrative officials of the school, 
and by the very nature of things cannot be delegated to any one 
else. Any attempt, too, to justify self-government by the state- 
ment that it removes the problems of discipline from the shoulders 
of the administrative officials of the school must fail. The prob- 
lems will still arise and will still be handled by the principal, prob- 
ably at an equal or greater expense of time and effort through a 
scheme of student self-government, than if dealt with directly. 
So, a teacher of arithmetic can herself more easily solve an 
given problem that may arise in her subject, and at less expe
-P-A-G-E-367
  COLLATERAL ACTIVITIES 357 
of time, than if she has her class solve it; but the primary end 
she seeks is not the conservation of time and energy, nor is the 
solution of the problem itself her concern. What she desires is 
that her class shall acquire, through practice with that particular 
problem, an ability to deal with arithmetical problems. 
The attitude of the principal toward a scheme of self-government 
must bea similar one. He should look upon himself as an instructor 
in democracy, and upon his organization for self-government as his 
classroom or laboratory. If the intermediate school is to perform 
the socializing function that it professes to be its main objective, 
it must afford the pupil an opportunity, under wise and careful 
direction, to practice democracy; to learn intelligent obedience to 
properly constituted authority; to discover and develop qualities 
of leadership; to respect the will of the majority; and, in general, 
to practice the self-control that democracy is based upon. 
What the organization and framework of such a scheme will be, 
will depend upon the local conditions of every school. It cannot 
be successfully established until a proper school spirit is developed 
by long and careful preparation, and it must be maintained by un- 
remitting vigilance. The home-room group furnishes a logical 
unit upon which the intermediate school may build such a system. 
       
   
            
    
                              Rochester, New York, Junior High schools stimulate 
student responsibility in several specific ways. The home 
room is organized as a class government. Class guides 
serve as captains of various divisions of students and lead 
their lines in the corridors, at fire drills, and in other forms 
of marching. Class ushers receive visitors to the school, 
and escort them to the desired portion of the building. 
Bicycle committees receive and check bicycles, place them 
in their stalls, and at dismissal return the wheels to their 
claimants. Luncheon committees control the procedure in 
going to and returning from the cafeterias. Safety-first 
committees are alert to check and report dangerous condi- 
tions found in and about the buildings.

        traffic immediately in front of the school building just 
preceding and following the calling and dismissal of school, 
errand boys and girls, toilet-room committees, playground 
monitors, attendance clerks — these are but a few additional 
appointments that are made or services that are rendered 
in other junior high schools. The list might be extended at 
length. 
SCHOOL CLUBS 
Perhaps no better formulation of the club ideal has been 
published than that appearing in a booklet issued by the 
Washington Junior High School, Rochester, New York, 
and entitled Clubs: 
The club ideal is purely avocational, democratic, and is based 
upon the doctrine of individual justice for all. In it are reflected 
the fundamental principles for which the junior high school is the 
exponent. Clubs have an immediate and a deferred value: the 
formation of good habits now in the use of spare time; the pro- 
vision in life for an avocation. It is not enough that a man make 
a living; he must enjoy living. Leisure hours well spent make for 
complete living. When the time comes that every man is equipped 
with a worthy hobby, there will be less discontent and crime in the 
world. 
The boy and the girl in the teens are plastic and susceptible to 
outside influence. Then the natural instinct for social life begins 
to assert itself. The boy becomes interested in the “‘gang”; the 
girl discovers her best “girl friend.” It is the age of restless ac- 
tivity, of hero worship, of leadership development. The school 
must meet the youth on his own ground — not by repression, but 
by expression through interesting and well-planned channels. 
The club system aims to provide for every kind of activity. 
For some children it is interest in wireless; for many browsing 
around a bookshelf or collecting stamps; for others exchanging 
bits of camp lore; for still others excursions into the woods fo 
birds or flowers. After three years it is difficult to conceive of 
boy or girl who has not developed an enthusiasm for some hobby. 
Clubs are intrinsically avocational, distinct in spirit from or
-P-A-G-E-369
  
COLLATERAL ACTIVITIES 359 
dinary school work. But in many instances they offer further 
field for exploration and become vocational. More than one boy 
has caught a vision that revolutionized his plans for life work. 
Often a latent talent whose existence might never have been de- 
tected is brought to light. A lad, who intended to leave school at 
the end of the eighth grade, spent one term in the Landscape 
Gardening Club and thereupon planned for high school; another, 
of supposedly ordinary ability, exhibited through the Pottery Club 
an apparent native skill in sculpturing. 
Since the corner stone of the junior high school is justice for 
the individual, every student must be given an equal chance adapted 
to his abilities and aptitudes. In the club this doctrine of “‘in- 
dividual justice”’ is emphasized. ‘The students themselves elect a 
club in accordance with their own ideas, each one choosing the 
thing he likes best. “‘And no one shall work for money, and no 
one shall work for fame; But each for the joy of working.” 
Democracy is a distinctive feature of the clubs. It provides 
an interest common to all, irrespective of age, of class, or nationality. 
In one club may be found members from perhaps every department 
in the school, banded together for mutual pleasure. Thus are the 
varied elements in the school leavened into a beautiful good fellow- 
ship — good fellowship that results from working side by side for a 
common purpose. 
The final analysis of the club ideal shows the formation of char- 
acter to be a fundamental element. Clubs are potent influences. 
Real character is revealed by the method in which one spends his 
leisure hours. In a “Common Sense Talk” put out by a Rochester 
firm for its employees, the statement is made: “A fellow who is 
seen at a lecture or deep in a book or busied about some hobby is 
judged to be a man of purpose and self respect.” 
School clubs in some ways resemble the informal education of 
old Greece where the master was one with his pupils who clustered 
about him in small groups and with a common interest at heart 
developed wisdom and character. The modern ideal, however, is 
not limited in its scope, but embraces all activities of life. On 
Friday morning from eleven to eleven-fifty Washington Junior 
High School presents the unique picture of eighteen hundred boys 
and girls engaged in the pursuit of happiness, each in his own way. 
Truly does the school fulfill the mission of making true men and 
women for our great Republic. 
   
-P-A-G-E-370
  360 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
Continuing, the bulletin gives a brief sketch of the plan 
of organization of clubs. It is as follows: 
The organization of clubs is simplified as much as possible. The 
students on the second Friday of the term choose three clubs from 
the completed list and state the reasons for each choice. The 
students are assigned to first choice if possible, to second or third 
if necessary. ‘Those who give the most forceful reasons are con- 
sidered first. Attendance is checked by small tickets bearing the 
name of the club. One is given to every member at each meeting. 
Each club is self-supporting. Many clubs have no expense. Where 
club membership involves expense, it is merely for materials the 
student himself uses and they are sold to him at cost. 
Seven B classes do not elect a club, but form one large group of 
their own with special programs dealing with life in junior high 
school. The objective is to initiate the pupils into the school 
organization and to educate them in the school spirit.! 
The Washington Junior High School, conforming to these 
ideals, makes provision for sixty clubs, as follows: 
Airplane Club Folk Song and Dance Club 
Athletic Club (Boys) French Club

The Manual Arts High School of Los Angeles, California, 
furnishes a good illustration of what may be done with 
student collateral activities. In speaking of the value of 
such endeavors a bulletin of the school says: 
It is clearly recognized at Manual that many elements besides 
the formal studies enter into the well-rounded education. Not 
only are students kept in school by added interests and pleasures, 
but the associations and experience supplied by the various activities 
are invaluable preparation for helpful, public-spirited citizenship. 
The bulletin then describes the following types of or- 
ganizations : 
1. The Memerian Society is a scholarship organization, ad- 
mission to which is secured only by securing four A’s in a 
given semester. 
2. The Girls’ League, which aims to foster a spirit of “helpful- 
ness and democracy in the affairs of daily life” and to “‘en-

importance to the student body. 
16. The Board of Finance, composed of four teachers and three 
students whose duty it is to handle all money matters relat- 
ing to the school’s student activities. 
While the above list of activities is to be found operating 
in a senior high school of large size, and should not be adopted 
in toto for a junior high school — and particularly for a 
small school — it does offer suggestions as to what may be 
done. 
DRAMATICS 
Since a partially recognized function of our secordary 
schools pertains to instruction and training in dramatic 
art, the dramatic club deserves special consideration. That 
the drama constitutes a powerful agency for wielding 
influence over society has been recognized by all grea 
political, religious, and social leaders. That it likewis 
possesses a fascination for old and young is shown bot 
by the testimony of experts and by the general observatio
-P-A-G-E-373
  COLLATERAL ACTIVITIES 363 
of society at play almost anywhere. Particularly active, 
however, is the dramatic instinct in children and youths. 
In speaking of this instinct, Dr. G. Stanley Hall says: 
The dramatic instinct has innumerable outcroppings in childhood 
and youth, and the present seems to be the proper psychological 
moment for its appreciation and its utilization in education. .. . 
In the kindergarten they fly like birds, hop like frogs, go on all 
fours like quadrupeds, and mimic perhaps every person and voca- 
tion they know, and thus find enlargement and relief.’ 
Dr. Elnora Curtis, describing the same phenomenon in 
the life of children, says: 
This is the response to a need and desire felt everywhere and in 
all ages, — the desire to feel what others are feeling, to act and 
get experience by proxy, to get the enjoyment of borrowed pain, 
to put into practice the Aristotelian principle of katharsis. All 
this so true of man is still more true of the child and youth, live 
with surplus energy, possessed by a craving for excitement, seeking 
always something new.? 
The dramatic craving is today seemingly more pronounced 
than ever before. With the coming of the motion picture 
the influence of dramatic art is extending into every home. 
In a recent census taken in Chicago, it was found that in a 
single day one sixth of the population of the entire city was 
at the theaters. At that rate, the total population could 
be reached in a week’s time. 
It is the contention of psychologists that the human mind 
is ever reaching out and searching for something concrete, 
tangible, and definite. These things the audience uncon- 
sciously receives in the theater. The drama of high quality 
has a deep-rooted fact or principle of life for its theme. It 
is presented in the theater where human beings receive their 
daily impressions which help to form their ideals, beliefs,

            convictions, likes and dislikes, attitudes, interests, and 
character. . 
That the junior high school should therefore give much 
attention to the drama and the development of wholesome 
dramatic interests is manifest when one considers not only 
that children of the junior high school age are the most 
numerous of our theater goers, but that the influences of 
the drama upon them are doubtless stronger than upon any 
other class of individuals. Youths will resort to almost 
any device to secure admission to the theater or motion 
picture show, and there’s a reason: it satisfies their craving 
for excitement, their curiosity, and their love for an ex- 
cursion into the world of the imagination. The vividness 
of imagery, interest in mysticism, spirit of adventuresome- 
ness, aspirations for religious experiences, and tendencies to 
hero worship are nothing more than the forceful under- 
currents of the dramatic instinct in their life. The whole 
demand for the dramatic is only the demand for the expres- 
sion of personality and the chance to escape from natural 
and imposed limitations. The drama gives the child a 
hitherto unrecognized outlet of expression, stimulates his 
imagination, and develops assurance in naturally timid 
individuals. It affords a new field of work in composition 
and can be correlated with the work of the art, music, and 
physical training departments. 
The training of these sentiments is therefore one of the 
conspicuous needs of the age, and the junior high school is 
most admirably constituted to undertake the task. Prop- 
erly administered, dramatic training should contribute 
directly to the realization of all seven of the objectives 
established by the Committee on the Reorganization of 
Secondary Education as outcomes of the public schools. 
Therefore as many individuals as possible should be en- 
couraged to participate actively in dramatic productions,

and to this end short plays of high literary and artistic 
merit should constitute the chief undertakings of the junior 
high school in this line. Moreover, such plays are the best 
adapted to junior high school production. 
SOCIAL RECREATION 
Ample opportunity should be provided for purely social 
recreation by arranging social affairs at frequent intervals. 
It is in connection with parties, “social mixers,”’ and dances 
that boys and girls come together for the sole purpose of 
enjoying one another’s society. Such intermingling pro- 
duces a noticeable diminution of the silliness that so often 
characterizes the relations of boys and girls at this age. A 
requirement that all social activities of clubs and classes 
be held in the afternoon will remove many difficulties. 
The details of these affairs may best be worked out by 
those in charge. It is advisable that as far as possible social 
activities be made a part of the pupils’ regular program, so 
that pupils who are engaged in vocational work outside of 
school shall have an opportunity to attend them. The 
practice of restricting social affairs to certain days of the 
week has much to recommend it. 
ATHLETICS 
Boys and girls of junior high school age are keenly inter- 
ested in sports. In the past, however, the sports provided 
for them have been either too strenuous or too simple. They 
have also been too limited in range, and too haphazard in 
organization, for the results they sought to obtain. School 
sports, to be effective, should benefit all pupils, giving pleas- 
ure to the robust and strength to the weak. By their appeal 
to the spirit of fair play, they can implant high ideals of 
sportsmanship in the minds of all concerned. 
 
-P-A-G-E-377
    COLLATERAL ACTIVITIES 367 
The best scheme of administration is that which permits 
every child to participate in every contest, competing only 
with pupils of like abilities. By organizing the pupils into 
groups and the groups into leagues, and avoiding all class 
distinctions in making selections, a system of organized 
athletics can be built up which in no wise loses any of the 
advantages connected with interscholastic contests and 
which, moreover, secures benefits not possible under other 
arrangements. 
Several ways of scoring achievements under this plan 
have been proposed. One, advocated by E. P. Gilchrist, 
is as follows: 
The method proposed does motivate athletics for all, for it offers 
to each the satisfaction of having his performance, mediocre or even 
bad though it be, count in a total score for his school. . . . Further- 
more, the method offers opportunity for direct competition between 
schools in distant localities. By means of it, the boys of San Fran- 
cisco, Boston, Denver, Kalamazoo, Mobile, ete., are brought into 
immediate competition, for the schools of each city undertake 
therein to show the highest average of athletic ability. 
The method of scoring involves the somewhat arbitrary fixing 
of a scale of measurement of values. The scale is a correlation of 
point-value with excellence. To illustrate:

Another plan that stimulates personal effort and produces 
good results for all, is that of conducting a school play festi- 
val late in the spring months and of awarding badges to 
every youth who attains to certain predetermined standards 
in athletic or gymnastic exercises. As in the plan of Mr. Gil- 
christ, the contest can be arranged for boys and girls sepa- 
rately, and among each group further classification can be 
made in accordance with the pupils’ ages or other criteria. 
The following is an illustration of this plan: 
A badge is to be awarded to each boy who qualifies in all three 
events in any of the following classes :

It is sometimes desirable to have boys and girls associated in 
athletics of the less strenuous type. 
The attitude of the authorities in the Ben Blewett Junior 
High School, St. Louis, toward athletics is based on common 
sense and a thorough understanding of the needs of young 
pupils : 
Blewett endeavors to stress intra-school athletics and organized 
play; attempt is made to draw every boy and girl into the games of 
gymnasium and playground. A wholesome spirit of competition 
is fostered between individuals and classes, and with the individual’s 
own achievements. During the past autumn there have been series 
of interclass games in playground baseball, in soccer, in track and 
field athletics. Monday afternoons find six interclass games of 
seventh-grade advisory groups, Wednesdays, eighth-grade teams, 
Fridays, ninth-grade. Grade winners play each other for the 
school championship. Each Tuesday are held track and field 
contests, two or three events only each week, with separate heats 
and finals for the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades, culminating 
in finals for school championships. The Tuesday series, growing 
more strenuous from week to week, culminates in a cross-country 
run, or a hare and hound race. Careful records in all events are 
kept, and through a scoring system, boys who consistently show a 
fair degree of ability may win the school letter. The soccer series 
of competition for school championship, beginning with outer 
 
-P-A-G-E-381
    COLLATERAL ACTIVITIES 371 
advisory group games, is inaugurated as soon as playground base- 
ball is finished. Similar series of outdoor competition in games 
suitable for girls are also held; baseball, dodge ball, basket ball, 
and volley ball are popular.! 
Four conditions are essential for the carrying out of an 
extensive and varied program of athletics in the junior high 
school: 
(1) Favorable surroundings for outdoor exercise. 
(2) Classification of pupils according to gymnastic ability. 
(3) A program of non-standardized athletic sports. (The 
standardized ones give encouragement to notoriety 
seeking and to competitions for championship.) 
(4) Provision for medical gymnastics in connection with 
physical training. 
The athletic department should have the use of two large 
athletic fields for outdoor exercise both in summer and on 
warm days in winter, and two large, well-ventilated gym- 
nasiums, one for the girls and one for the boys. These 
should have swimming pools, running tracks, a large playing 
floor, offices and separate rooms for physical examination, 
and be equipped with hand ball, boxing, wrestling, and other 
modern gymnasium apparatus. A school physician for the 
boys and a school nurse for the girls should be close at hand, 
and the entire department should be presided over by a 
physical instructor who knows how boys and girls should 
be developed and what kind of exercise is best suited to cor- 
rect physical defects, an instructor who realizes that his 
business is to take his pupils as he finds them and to develop 
each one according to that pupil’s natural ability, not merely 
to develop the best specimens and force the rest to drop out 
and look on. 
The following plan for administering a physical education 
schedule has been suggested :

N°? particular standard plan for the junior high school 
building has as yet been adopted. In making arrange- 
ments for junior high school pupils, however, it is well to 
remember that the best is none too good. To dedicate to 
their use a structure that has been abandoned for senior 
high school purposes because of its inconveniences, lack of 
sanitary arrangements, and general dilapidation is to defeat 
the very ends a junior high school seeks to attain. Never- 
theless, many a so-called junior high school has been formed 
during the last ten years largely, or solely, because the local 
building situation forced the issue. In all too many in- 
stances, a new and modern building has been erected for the 
senior high school and an old and unattractive structure has 
been turned over to the junior high school. The truly de- 
fensible procedure is quite the reverse. Attractive physical 
surroundings have an especially strong influence upon boys 
and girls; consequently, a building intended for the use of 
junior high school pupils should be of such a nature as to 
satisfy their love of beauty and to awaken in them a sense of 
the value of neat and harmonious arrangements. The build- 
ing should also possess all the distinctive features demanded 
by a program of studies and extra-curricular activities de- 
signed to meet the needs of adolescent children. 
Both the building and the program of studies are, however, 
but means to an end; namely, that the educational objec- 
tives may be realized. The building, therefore, should not 
be erected on general architectural lines while the program 
of work is left to be adapted to it; rather the aim and pur- 
ose of the school as an institution should determine the 
aching, and this in turn should determine the form and 
haracter of the school building. 
873
-P-A-G-E-384
874 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
There should be ample provision for shops, laboratories, 
and workrooms, designed, arranged, and equipped with 
reference to the activities to be carried on within them and 
with regard to the stage of development of the pupils who 
are to use them. Similar considerations require that various 
types of seating arrangements be installed, some rooms being 
fitted with adjustable seats and desks; other rooms with 
movable chairs with arm-rests; still other rooms with benches 
and writing-folders; and, again, others with chairs and tables, 
or stools and adjustable book-rests. 
Throughout the building, the ideals of serviceability, 
suitability, and beauty should dominate. Light, airy, cheer- 
ful rooms, well supplied with suitable school apparatus; 
sound-proof walls and floors; spacious corridors; com- 
modious elevators and stairways — these, at least, should 
be found in every junior high school building. 
The size of the junior high school building will obviously be 
determined by the program of studies, the size of the town, 
the school population, the resources at the command of the 
builders, and the desire on the part of the authorities to make 
provision for future needs. Seemingly, it is a mistake to 
erect any junior high school building, whatever be its size, 
without making adequate provision for academic work, 
auditorium meetings, athletics and physical training, manual 
and practical arts, fine arts and music, and various collateral 
activities. 
Superintendent Marsh describes the new buildings at 
Jackson, Michigan, as follows: 
      
     
   
         
              
   
            The two new intermediate schools of Jackson are designed to 
accommodate the entire school enrollment in grades seven, eight, and 
nine. They are called “intermediate” rather than “junior high” 
schools, because the term seems more logical and because it is be- 
lieved that these schools ought not to be thought of as high schools 
at all, but as intermediate in all respects between the elementary

school below and the high school above — intermediate in organ- 
ization, in methods of discipline and control, in subject matter of 
instruction, in methods of teaching. 
The buildings themselves — in cost, in architectural features, 
in layout of rooms, amount of space devoted to different depart- 
ments — partake of the nature of both elementary and high school. 
For instance, because it is believed that the intermediate schools 
ought to make easy the transition from the lower to the higher 
school, the buildings contain a certain number of rooms of the 
ordinary elementary school type where the pupils become adjusted 
gradually to the specialized departmental organization of the high 
school. 
The West Intermediate School is 270 feet long by 140 feet wide, 
built of brick trimmed with Bedford stone, and fireproof through- — 
out. The cost of building and contents was $370,000. The 
East Intermediate School is 320 feet long by 128 feet wide, and cost 
with contents $285,000. While the two buildings differ in size 
and architectural treatment, they are alike in other essential par- 
ticulars. Both were planned with a view to future extensions, 
only the central features and a minimum number of classrooms 
being included in the present structure. Each contains auditorium ; 
cafeteria; separate gymnasiums for boys and girls; swimming 
pool; shower baths and locker rooms; mill, bench, and lathe rooms ; 
print shop; mechanical drawing and art rooms; sewing, cooking, 
and housekeeping rooms; laundry; bookkeeping, stenography, 
and typewriting rooms; general science and agriculture labora- 
tories; plant room; study hall, and recitation rooms. 
Primarily the new schools represent an attempt to solve the prob- 
lem of the education of children of the early adolescent age. It 
is planned, first, to hold the children in school by making the school 
itself as interesting and attractive to them as possible; then, to 
recognize frankly that nature has not made them all alike; to offer, 
not the same education, but equal educational opportunity to all of 
them; to develop and train whatever abilities they have; to dis- 
cover powers, tastes, and aptitudes; and finally to turn over to the 
high school as many of them as possible prepared to choose in 
telligently and follow profitably the lines of work in which the 
are most apt to succeed.!

In speaking of the twelve new intermediate buildings 
planned for Buffalo, Mr. Ittner, the architect, says that in 
many respects they will be pioneer buildings of this type. 
Each of the Buffalo buildings exhibits the following features :

12. Three stories in height, accommodating twelve hundred 
pupils. 
The school basement eliminated. 
Classrooms on one side of the corridors only, thus per- 
mitting a maximum of sunlight to penetrate to all parts 
of the building. 
The first floor to be used for administrative rooms, 
the auditorium, the vocational departments, the lunch- 
room, and the room for physical training. This floor 
is also to serve the larger community interests of the 
locality. 
Classrooms planned to permit laboratory and socialized 
class methods. 
. A library-study-reference room to serve also as a room 
for the meetings of all student societies and govern- 
ing bodies — in short, to serve as a civic-social center 
for the school. 
A special room for music and public speaking planned 
as a small auditorium seating one hundred and fifty 
persons, and provided with a stage and a storage room 
for music instruments. 
Three gymnasiums of standard size. 
A locker room on the ground floor. 
A lunchroom, accommodating three hundred pupils. 
Rooms in the basement for both men and women 
janitors. 
The entire building to be designed to serve community 
needs and community gatherings as well as the 
purposes of the school pupils. 
The plans for the new Detroit intermediate schools call 
for like innovations. A brief description of some of these 
follows : 
In recognition of the fact that the success of this school will 
depend in a large degree upon the skill with which it is administered,
-P-A-G-E-388
  378 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
an attempt has been made to plan the offices in a way that will be 
most conducive to effective administration. 
Separate administrative offices are provided for the health de- 
partment. The general administrative offices are located on the 
second floor. They include offices for the principal and assistant 
principal, a general waiting room with space for clerks, and a large 
room divided into administrative compartments to be used by heads 
of departments and vocational counselors. 
Adjoining the administrative offices will be a teachers’ workroom. 
The general plan of organization does not include a separate room for 
each teacher. This workroom will be a general work and study 
room for teachers. Here each teacher will have a locker for her 
books and papers and tables will be provided for work or study. 
A section of this room will be seated with special opera chairs facing 
a raised platform. This space will be used for faculty meetings 
and other group meetings, and may be utilized at times as a small 
auditorium. 
While this building has been arranged primarily and definitely to 
meet the requirements of the intermediate school, the needs of the 
community also have been kept in mind. By the proper location 
of iron gates, that portion of the building which includes the com- 
munity rooms for women and men, the community locker rooms, 
the showers and pools, the gymnasium and the auditorium can be 
isolated from the remainder of the building. This plan makes the 
building available for community use and, at the same time, avoids 
many unpleasant administrative problems which might otherwise 
arise. 
The fourth floor provides ample space for Boy Scout and similar 
activities. A large scout room, equipped with movable furniture, 
is provided, together with an office for scoutmasters. 
The library, on the third floor, is designed to meet the needs of 
the school from both practical and recreational standpoints. The 
library suite consists of a large reading room, a classroom, or club- 
room, a workroom, a teachers’ conference room, and six small 
conference rooms for student committees or groups of pupils in- 
terested in common projects. 
On the first floor, space is planned for a moderate sized audito- 
rium. Its capacity will approximate 750. Its purpose is not 
primarily for general assemblies or for community use, but for 
regular school work. The auditorium will be used continuously 
 
-P-A-G-E-389
  THE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL BUILDING 379 
during the day for work of a distinctly socializing nature. It is 
planned to bring the pupils together under conditions which will 
make them conscious of their social relationships, and the sub- 
stance of the auditorium instruction will have a distinct trend in 
this direction. 
The cafeteria has complete kitchen equipment and serving counter 
and will accommodate 322 at a seating. A teachers’ dining room 
is in connection. 
All classrooms have built-in cabinets for books and supplies, and 
teachers’ cloak closets. Classrooms and gymnasium floors are of 
hard maple. Corridor floors are of battleship linoleum with 
terrazzo base and cove. The library floor is of linoleum. Toilets, 
auditorium, lunch, and locker rooms are floored with mastic with 
composition base and cove. All stairways are of terrazzo.! 
Again, speaking particularly of the completed Barbour 
Intermediate School, the editor of the Detroit Educational 
Bulletin writes as follows: 
The Barbour Intermediate School, which will be opened at the 
beginning of the second semester, is one of the finest and most 
complete school buildings in the Detroit school plant. In planning 
the details of the building, educational specifications were furnished 
by the various departments of instruction concerned. ‘These were 
incorporated into the plans by the architects and engineers and 
checked therein by the departments of instruction, so that the 
building, as to its instructional features, represents the collective 
best ideas of all the departments of instruction in the city. 
Furthermore, in the hope that the building would become a com- 
munity center in which the various community clubs and neighbor- 
hood organizations would meet, clubrooms for men and women are 
provided, which, with the gymnasiums, showers, pools, library 
and auditorium, will be available for extra-curricular and com- 
munity use. They may be shut off from the rest of the building 
and are heated and ventilated separately. 
All departments of instruction included in the new intermediate 
school curriculum, which was drawn up tentatively before plans 
for the building were attempted, have been provided for in the Bar- 
bour Intermediate building. Two gymnasiums, one for the boys

and one for the girls, each 50 feet by 80 feet, and equipped with 
toilet, shower, and examination room, and having a director’s office 
in connection, are situated on the second floor of the building. 
Separate swimming pools are provided for boys and girls, and 
shower rooms—the girls’ containing seventy-two individual 
showers, while the boys’ is of the “runway” type — are in con- 
nection with the plunges. For the use of the Health Department 
of the city in its work in the schools, aclinic is provided, containing 
separate rooms for physician, dentist, nurse, and a waiting room 
for patients. These, with two open play courts, provide for the 
health education of the pupils. 
The equipment for vocational work is no less complete. Shops of 
various sorts, electrical, wood, mechanical, print, and a general shop 
for household mechanics, where the younger boys learn “‘handy- 
man” activities, are provided on the ground floor. On the second 
and third floors, a mechanical drawing room, cooking rooms, sew- 
ing rooms, a model flat, and cafeteria and kitchen, where certain 
girls will learn to do cafeteria work, as well as typewriting and book- 
keeping rooms, complete the equipment which gives the pupils an 
opportunity to try out the various vocations which they may want 
to follow after leaving school. 
The auditorium and library, two very important units in the new 
socialized school program, have been carefully planned to be usable 
at all times during the day. The library has a large main reading 
room, a classroom, seven small conference rooms, and a librarian’s 
workroom. Its open shelves have room for ten thousand volumes. 
Classrooms are situated on both sides of the corridor on all three 
floors. Lighting is unilateral, except the five corner rooms, which 
are equipped for fresh air classes. They all have built-in cabinets 
for books and supplies, and are provided with a teacher’s cloak 
room. 
The administrative quarters are planned to give every aid pos- 
sible to the administrative staff. In one group, on the second floor, 
are the offices of the principal, assistant principal, and clerks, with 
separate offices for the heads of departments and for the home visit- 
ing teacher and educational and vocational counselors. A large 
waiting room, and, across the corridor, a teachers’ workroom, com- 
plete the office space.

sachusetts, writes as follows:

THE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL BUILDING 385 
The city of Peabody worked out a unique plan for a building for a 
junior-senior high school. The plan consisted of a central building 
containing auditorium and gymnasium articulating according to 
Mr. Ittner’s scheme, a library, domestic science equipment, a music 
room, and a central administrative room to be used by both schools. 
The senior high school was to occupy a building on one side and the 
junior high school on the other, and the two end buildings were to 
be connected with the central building by means of a neck, a straight 
corridor to run the entire length of the three buildings. On account 
of the high cost of building Peabody is not carrying out the plan 
in its entirety but will probably have the ‘entire plan eventually. 
I am a strong believer in that type of building for a community hav- 
ing only one junior and one senior high school, even if the number 
of pupils in the two schools may be as great as two thousand. 
 
-P-A-G-E-396
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE 
JuNIoR HicgH ScHooLt STANDARDS 
HROUGHOUT his discussions the writer has been 
guided by the conviction that the junior high school 
is, as yet, a type of school that is too new and too dynamic 
to admit of complete standardization. Hence, he has sought 
not to be dogmatic in his statements, but to give due promi- 
nence to important differences of opinion in regard to plans 
of junior high school organization and administration. 
Progress, however, is never made merely by observing exist- 
ing conditions. Progress results only when each new plan 
that is tried is analyzed and the best elements it contains are 
reshaped and reapplied. The junior high school movement 
must from time to time be analyzed in this manner. Its 
various constituent elements must be evaluated, and ten- 
tative standards established. Such standards should serve 
not so much to define limits as to indicate the general direc- 
tion the movement is taking. 
In accordance with this idea, wherever any concerted 
attempt has been made to formulate standards for evaluating 
the junior high school, such standards have been presented 
as provisional and tentative. Nevertheless, such formula- 
tions are helpful, and worthy of all consideration. 
STANDARDS FORMULATED IN MASSACHUSETTS 
The following report on standards, prepared by 
C. R. Stacey, was adopted by the Schoolmen of Massa- 
chusetts in 1918: 
(1) Membership should consist of pupils in grades corresponding 
to the seventh and eighth of the elementary school, and the freshman 
year of the high school. 
(Il) Admission should be governed not only by scholastic attain- 
ment and mental maturity, but also by age and physical maturity. 
386 
 
-P-A-G-E-397
  
JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL STANDARDS 387 
(III) The program of study should provide a wide variety of 
work. In the seventh grade each pupil should try out his abilities. 
For this purpose he should have some experience in several of the 
following: industrial arts, household arts, gardening, a foreign 
language, and commercial work, such as typewriting. Some of 
these subjects may be organized into short units, but in any case 
each pupil should actually take a variety of work instead of choosing 
one of several untried subjects. 
In the eighth and ninth grades some pupils may continue this 
try-out process while others may choose a particular line of work 
which appears to be adapted to their needs. It is, however, impor- 
tant that these choices should be regarded as provisional, not as 
final. The pupil should be encouraged to keep an open and inquir- 
ing mind and to revise early choices if some other line of work ap- 
pears to be better adapted to his needs. Much work should be 
taken in common by all pupils for various reasons, and at the close 
of the junior high school period all pupils should be admitted to the 
senior high school, whatever electives they may have chosen. . . 
(IV) Departmental teaching should be introduced gradually. 
It is desirable to have each subject taught by one especially quali- 
fied, but to take a pupil abruptly from the constant instruction of 
one teacher to instruction by as many teachers as he has subjects 
is to put serious difficulties in his path. .. . 
(V) An early start should be made in some of the secondary school 
subjects for the sake of economizing the time of pupils doing the 
academic work, and in order to use better methods. . . . 
(VI) Promotion should be by subject rather than by grade. 
This appears to be an almost uniform usage, and calls for no dis- 
cussion. 
(VII) Supervised study is important. While the benefits of this 
policy should by no means be confined to the junior high school, the 
stage at which departmental teaching is begun and new studies 
introduced is an opportune time at which to introduce supervised 
StbOY 6 8 
(VIIT) Provision should be made for make-up work in the 
interests of the following : 
(a) Pupils who need help on work lost through absence. 
(b) Pupils of special ability who could with a little help make 
two grades in a subject in one year. 
(c) Pupils who are losing ground and need extra help in order to 
avoid failure. 
 
-P-A-G-E-398
388 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
In a small school each teacher should have some free time in which 
to give such assistance to individuals. In a large school special 
teachers also may be assigned to assist in this task... . 
(IX) A library should be an integral part of the junior high school. 
In a small school one of the teachers should be assigned for part of 
her time to the management of the library. An English teacher 
may well be given this work, and she should be relieved from a pro- 
portionate amount of classroom work. Ina large school a trained 
librarian should be employed on full time and on the same salary 
as a teacher, so that the library will make thoroughly available its 
reference books and material for supplementary reading and current 
news, and be most attractive as a reading room. 
(X) The discipline should take into account the period of develop- 
ment through which the pupils are passing. Boys and girls in the 
early teens are no longer children, neither are they as yet young 
men and women. The maternal sort of control characteristic of the 
elementary school ought to give place to a kind of government that 
permits free scope for pupil initiative, self-control, and self-direction. 
(XI) The training of the teachers for a junior high school is of 
paramount importance. Rochester gave definite preliminary 
training to those who were to teach in the new school. Experience 
in teaching was made a prerequisite, and each teacher must also 
have studied, at least in the high school, the subject that she desired 
to teach. In each subject the senior high school teacher and the 
grade teachers developed a course of study together. They also 
reviewed the subject matter. This codperative effort furnished 
two elements, the blending of which was desirable for junior high 
schools. The former brought a greater mastery of content and the 
latter furnished greater experience with upper grade children and 
more thorough skill in methods. At the close of the school year 
each teacher received a rating based upon: (1) amount of ex- 
perience; (2) quality of experience; (3) professional training; 
(4) personality. Teachers receiving the highest ratings were first 
selected in making up the junior high school corps. Each teacher 
was to receive $100 more than she had previously had. Later the 
salaries were to be awarded according to merit. 
THE NORTH CENTRAL ASSOCIATION 
The North Central Association has, for several years, taken 
an interest in the formulation of standards for the junior high 
 
-P-A-G-E-399
  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL STANDARDS 389 
school. In 1920, a special committee reported in part as 
follows : 
In an effort to move in the direction of preparing a list of ap- 
proved junior high schools, the Committee has prepared a set of 
tentative standards covering such matters as: 
Preparation of Teachers Salary Schedule 
The Teaching Load Building and Equipment 
Program of Studies 
The tentative standards for the preparation of teachers in the 
junior high school are as follows: 
All teachers teaching one or more academic subjects must satisfy 
the following requirements : 
(A) The minimum attainment of the majority of the new 
teachers of academic subjects shall be equivalent to the 
completion of a four-year course of study in a standard 
college or normal school. 
(B) The minimum professional training of a new teacher of 
academic subjects shall be at least eleven semester hours in 
education. This should include special study of the subject 
matter and pedagogy of the subjects to be taught, including 
courses in junior high school administration and methods. 
Such requirements shall not be construed as retroactive. 
(C) The teachers not meeting requirement A shall be expected to 
complete at least one year of college work, including courses 
in junior high school administration and methods, within a 
reasonable time following their appointment to junior high 
school work. 
Under the heading, ‘“‘ Teaching Load,” the Committee has provided 
the following : 
(1) The number of daily periods of classroom instruction given 
by any teacher should not exceed six. 
(2) The average length of a recitation period should be forty 
minutes, exclusive of all time used in the changing of classes 
or teachers. 
(3) For schools having a plan of supervised study with class 
periods of fifty minutes or greater, not more than five classes 
per day should be assigned to any teacher. 
(4) No school whose records show an excessive number of pupils 
per teacher based on average attendance, shall be accredited. 
The Committee suggests twenty-five as a maximum.

    Under the heading, ‘‘Program of Studies,” the Committee has 
attempted to provide standards which require a marked departure 
from the traditional eight-four plan of school organization. These 
standards read : 
(1) The Committee believes that every junior high school should 
offer units of work in mathematics, social sciences, languages 
(including English), natural sciences, the fine arts, physical 
training, and certain of the so-called vocational subjects, 
such as agriculture, manual training, household economics, 
commercial subjects, etc. 
(2) No school shall be accredited unless evidence is submitted 
showing an attempt to define the units in the program of 
studies in a manner greater in scope and richer in content 
than that of the traditional elementary school. 
(3) No school shall be accredited whose administration of the 
program of studies does not provide for some choice of 
studies, elected under supervision, for promotion by subject, 
and for the testing out of individual aptitudes in academic and 
vocational work. 
(4) No school shall be accredited whose administration does not 
provide for some plan for supervised study. 
One of the standards arousing the greatest interest on the part of 
junior high school principals, relates to salary schedule. In fact, 
this standard was the most favored of all. The standard reads: 
No school shall be accredited whose salary schedule does not 
insure the attracting and retaining in the junior high school 
of teachers equal in teaching ability to those selected for senior 
high school teaching. 
The standard relating to the junior high school building and 
equipment reads : | 
The location and construction of the building, the lighting, 
heating, and ventilation of the rooms, the nature of the lavatories, 
corridors, closets, water supply, school furniture, apparatus, and 
methods of cleaning shall be such as to insure hygienic conditions 
for both pupils and teachers. The building should contain adequate 
laboratory, gymnasium, auditorium, and library facilities. 
The same Committee, in speaking of the proposed stand- 
ards, reported the sentiment of schoolmen, as voiced in 
replies to the questionnaire, to be as follows: 
1 Proceedings, North Central Association, pages 12-A et seq., 1920.
-P-A-G-E-401
  
JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL STANDARDS 391 
    
                                     
   
            
       
         
   All of these requirements appeared to be acceptable to the junior 
high schools, except the one relating to the number of pupils per 
teacher. It appears to many that twenty-five is too low a maximum 
on account of the great cost of supplying sufficient teachers, and 
thirty or thirty-five is the maximum suggested by a considerable 
number of school principals. One administrator, Mr. C. L. Spain, 
Deputy Superintendent of Detroit, Michigan, in commenting on 
this matter says: 
Under Part 3, ‘‘ Teaching Load,” the Committee suggests twenty- 
five as a class maximum. This seems to be altogether too low. 
It seems strange, if our schools are doing what they claim they 
are, that is, giving pupils more self-reliance and more power of self- 
direction as they progress through the grades, that we should find 
it necessary to segregate the seventh, eighth, and ninth grade classes 
into classes of twenty-five when we are successfully handling classes 
of thirty-five to forty-five in the lower grades. 
I see no reason why the intermediate or junior high schools 
should not handle pupils in classes of at least thirty and preferably 
thirty-five, and I do not believe that we are justified in reducing 
this standard as low as twenty-five. I might say that this is the 
opinion of others in the group here who are making some study of 
these matters. 
One year later this same Committee reported as follows: 
The Committee, after a careful examination of the reports from 
the schools asking classification, decided to delay the preparation 
of a list of approved non-eight-four schools. This very cautious 
procedure was adopted because of the grave danger of hindering the 
junior high school’s development by the adoption of an approved 
list before standards have been carefully studied, through a period 
of years. 
The Committee will continue its work in the direction to formu- 
late a better set of standards based on the best practice and will 
hope through this work to enable the Association to give some direc- 
tion to the movement in the direction of reorganization. 
To determine the best method of exercising the directive power 
f the North Central Association in encouraging the reorganization 
long right lines of schools departing from the eight-four plan, 
informal conference was held by the Committee on Thursday, 
arch 17, 1921, under the auspices of the Commission on Second- 
y Schools. This conference revealed a high degree of uncertainty
-P-A-G-E-402
  392 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
and confusion concerning the organization of junior high schools. 
A similar degree of uncertainty and confusion was reflected in 
the reports which the Committee received from schools which have 
undertaken some form of reorganization. 
        
        
    
      
    
    
       
      
   The Committee did, however, formulate and publish the 
following recommendations : 
(1) The secondary school should be a unit in the educational 
system and should include grades seven to twelve. Following the 
presentation of this report, the Committee was instructed by the 
Association to consider its work in terms of a secondary school 
period beginning with the seventh grade and continuing to the third 
year of the present college organization. 
(2) For purposes of administrative efficiency, these grades may 
be organized on the basis of the three-three plan, the two-four plan, 
the four-two plan, or the six-year plan as local conditions warrant. 
(3) Under usual conditions a school system with fewer than five 
hundred pupils in grades seven to twelve should not attempt to 
organize on the basis of more than one unit, provided these grades 
are housed in one building. 
(4) Under usual conditions a school system with considerably 
more than five hundred pupils should organize the secondary school 
into two units. 
(5) Ultimately the training of all teachers of academic subjects 
in grades seven to twelve should be the same as that fixed by the 
North Central Association for teachers in accredited high schools. 
(6) In its curricular offerings, a school should present a range 
of work in seventh and eighth grades which is more extensive than 
that offered in the traditional school, and provision should be made 
for some pupil choice of subjects. 
(7) In the administration of the program of studies in grades 
seven and eight, provision should be made for: 
(a) At least partial departmentalization of instruction. 
(b) Promotion by subject. 
(c) Pupil collateral activities supervised by school authorities. 
(d) Some form of supervised study, either by teachers in 
the classroom or by trained, experienced supervisors in 
larger study halls. 
(8) In the administration of the school, provision should 
made :
-P-A-G-E-403
  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL STANDARDS 393 
(a) For recitation periods of not less than thirty-five minutes, 
exclusive of all time used in the changing of classes or 
teachers. 
(6) For a teaching load of not more than thirty periods per 
week of forty minutes each. 
(c) For a number of pupils per teacher based on average at- 
tendance of not more than thirty. 
In March, 1923, the Committee made a third report and 
recommended the adoption of the following positive stand- 
ards and procedures : 
Standard Junior High School 
(1) A standard junior high school is a unit of our public school 
system consisting of grades seven, eight, and nine, organized and 
administered as a separate unit of the school system, having its 
own administrative head and corps of teachers, and characterized 
by flexible promotion, provisions for exploration and preview of 
subject matter in the early semesters of the course, and limited 
choice of elective subjects during the later semesters of the course. 
(a) Explanation: This standard in no wise means that the 
seventh and eighth grades should not be organized on a 
junior high school basis and meet the standards to follow; 
nor that the six-year school should not be organized where 
administrative convenience or necessity demands it. But 
such schools would not be regarded as standard... . 
(2) A six-year school shall be organized into two units so that 
the work of the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades shall meet all 
of the standards of the standard junior high school relative to 
curriculum, training of teachers, and articulation with the senior 
high school grades, the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth. 
(a) Neither the six-year school nor the two-year (seventh and 
eighth grades) junior high school is favored except as an 
administrative necessity. 
(b) In school systems enrolling fewer than five hundred pupils 
in grades seven to twelve, the committee feels the organiza- 
tion should be of the six-year type, but with the distinction 
clearly drawn between the junior and senior division at the 
end of the ninth year.

394 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
      
     
    
       
         
    
   Buildings 
(1) Facilities should be provided adequate for instruction in 
academic subjects, in the practical arts, in health education, in 
recreation, and in such subjects as may require the laboratory 
method. Adequate provision should be provided also for assembly 
programs, for social activities, and for the supervision or direction 
of study. ... 
Organization and Administration 
(1) The school year shall be not less than thirty-six weeks. 
(2) Twenty-five periods of prepared work per week shall be the 
maximum pupil load except in the case of pupils of more than 
average ability. 
(3) The salary schedule of teachers with preparation equivalent 
to that required for senior high school service shall be the same as 
that of the senior high school. 
Preparation of Teachers 
(1) The minimum academic training of junior high school 
teachers of academic subjects shall be equivalent to graduation 
from a college accredited by the North Central Association, which 
requires for graduation one hundred and twenty semester hours 
in advance of a four-year high school course. This provision 
shall not be retroactive. 
(2) The minimum professional training of junior high school 
teachers shall be not less than eleven semester hours. ‘This pro- 
vision shall not be retroactive... . 
The Teaching Load 
(1) The total number of forty-minute periods of classroom 
instruction given by any teacher of academic subjects shall not 
exceed thirty per week; nor shall the number of periods taught 
by any teacher of non-academic subjects exceed thirty-six per 
week. 
(2) The total number of periods of classroom instruction given 
by any teacher of academic subjects in a school having some definit 
plan of supervised study should not exceed twenty-five per week ;
-P-A-G-E-405
  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL STANDARDS 395 
nor should the number taught by any teacher of non-academic 
subjects exceed thirty per week. 
(3) The maximum number of pupils assigned daily to any 
teachers of academic subjects should not exceed 210. 
(4) The number of pupils per teacher based upon the average 
daily attendance should not exceed 25. 
Program of Studies 
(1) The appropriate subjects to be offered by the junior high 
school are: English, mathematics, foreign language, history and 
civics, geography and elementary science, music, art, health edu- 
cation, vocational information, and practical arts for both boys 
and girls, including commercial subjects. 
(2) The program of studies shall be organized into a single 
curriculum with limited electives. 
(a) Electives prior to the second semester of the eighth year are 
considered ill-advised. Prior to this semester, exploration 
and preview of subject matter should be provided by the 
content of courses and the administration of the curriculum 
and not by electives. 
(3) Instruction shall be departmentalized. 
(4) The school shall practice flexible promotion rather than 
promotion by subject. 
(a) Flexible promotion means that pupils shall be promoted 
when the occasion arises and without restriction of subject 
promotion. It means pupil placement. It implies the use 
of opportunity classes and coaching teachers. 
(5) The school shall provide within the school day for pupil 
club and social activities under the direction of the faculty. 
(6) The school shall provide adequately for keeping in contact 
with the homes and home life of the pupils and shall introduce 
only gradually the freedom in discipline characteristic of the senior 
high school. 
(7) The school shall place at least as much emphasis upon the 
supervision of study as upon recitation. 
Articulation with the Senior High School 
(1) The completion of the course in a standard junior high school 
‘shall admit the pupil to full standing in a standard three-year senior 
high school. 
 
-P-A-G-E-406
  396 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
(2) Upon completion of the junior high school course the pupils 
shall be placed in any grade of any given subject in the three-year 
senior high school for which he is prepared. 
(3) The standard three-year senior high school shall offer such 
ninth-year courses as may be necessary to provide adequately for 
pupils who may need such courses after they have been promoted 
to the senior high school, but such courses shall not constitute a 
part of the senior high school curriculum. 
(4) In special cases pupils may be promoted to the senior high 
school prior to the completion of the junior high school course 
when it is evident that the best interests of the pupils are thus 
served. 
Further Recommendations of the Committee 
(1) That the colleges, in order to encourage the reorganization 
of the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades upon a junior high school 
basis, be requested to provide an alternative system of entrance 
requirements to include not more than twelve units of senior high 
school work, said units to be completed in the tenth, eleventh, and 
twelfth grades. 
(2) That the following distribution of units for entrance to 
North Central colleges and universities be considered in the re- 
statement of entrance requirements: a major of 3 units; two 
minors of 2 units each (4 units); electives, 5 units; total, 12 units. 
(a) English shall be offered either as a major or minor. 
(6b) At least nine of the twelve units shall be in academic subjects. 
(c) The two minors may be specified for entrance to the various 
colleges of any university. 
(3) That the present high school standards of teacher training 
of the North Central Association be applied to the ninth grade 
wherever found until such time as standards can be established 
for the ninth grade in junior high schools. 
(4) That the Association take steps to recognize three-year 
senior high schools as standard schools. 
(5) That a committee be appointed by the Executive Committee 
of the North Central Association to prepare in keeping with the 
preceding recommendations the requirements for a list of recognized 
junior high schools, and to formulate a plan for the inspection of 
such schools with the view of establishing a recognized list; ‘said 
committee to consist of two members of the Commission on Unit

JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL STANDARDS 397 
Courses and Curricula, two members of the Commission on Sec- 
ondary Schools, two members of the Commission on Higher In- 
stitutions, and six public school officials; said committee to report 
at the North Central meeting in March, 1924. It is further recom- 
mended that the said committee report on the number of schools 
in the North Central territory which meet the requirements pro- 
posed and that the work be carried to the point where a list of such 
schools can be submitted to the Association for approval in 19265.! 
SUGGESTIONS FROM WASHINGTON 
In connection with plans for the organization and adminis- 
tration of junior high schools in the State of Washington, a 
committee report, made March 3, 1920, contained twenty- 
four queries that were recommended to supervisors for con- 
sideration and answer before any definite steps in reorgani- 
zation were taken. These questions offer suggestions for 
standards and may serve as guides to the procedure to be 
followed in establishing them. 
Planning for an Organization on the Six-Three-Three Plan or 
Six-Six Plan 
A reorganization on the six-three-three or six-six plan calls for 
very careful investigation as to ways and means of organizing and 
administering a junior high school, or a junior division (grades seven, 
eight, and nine) of the six-year high school. The superintendent 
and principal will need to consider and, so far as possible, solve in 
advance the following problems : 
(1) Housing. What distribution should be made of the floor 
space? If part of the high school plant is to be used, how can 
provision be made for keeping junior high school students to some 
extent separate from senior high school students? A partial segre- 
gation will be necessitated by difference between these two groups 
in educational requirements, disciplinary measures needed, and 
social activities engaged in. 
(2) How long a school day should the junior high school have? 
(3) What should be the length of the periods ?

(4) What subjects of instruction should be offered and what 
proportion of the pupil’s time should be given to each? 
(5) How much freedom of election should be allowed to the 
students in grade seven? grade eight? grade nine? 
(6) How can provision be made for laboratories, gymnasium, 
and library ? 
(7) What methods of instruction should be used ? 
(8) How is the schedule, or program, to be constructed ? 
(9) Is the instruction to be wholly departmentalized ? 
(10) What arrangements are to be made for study supervision? 
(11) What scheme can be devised to carry out vocational and 
moral guidance ? 
(12) What are to be the general policies on discipline ? 
(13) What is to be the division of labor between superintendent 
and principal in working out the junior high school plan? 
(14) What arrangements are to be made for supervision and 
codrdination or instruction ? 
(15) What provision should be made for outside activities, such 
as athletics, dramatics, glee clubs, and social life ? 
(16) What textbooks are to be chosen for use? 
(17) What books are to be ordered for the library ? 
(18) What equipment and supplies are to be ordered ? 
(19) What are to be the requirements for admission to the junior 
high school? Should over-aged pupils who have not completed the 
sixth grade be admitted ? 
(20) What are to be the requirements for the completion of the 
junior high school ? 
(21) What grading system and credit system are to be used? 
(22) How can the work of the junior high school be so articulated 
with the school below and above and so graduated in content and 
method as to avoid two bad breaks instead of only one? 
(23) What account can be taken of individual differences in 
pupils? Can provision be made for accelerated and retarded 
groups ? 
(24) What type of faculty organization should be adopted? 
Should the junior and senior high school faculties be separate, or 
should they overlap, in schools working on the six-six plan ?

  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL STANDARDS 399 
PENNSYLVANIA REQUIREMENTS 
Pennsylvania has recently issued a circular entitled 
“Essentials for Junior High School Classification.” In this, 
the positive and recommended standards are as follows: 
(I) Type of organization; seventh and eighth and ninth grades 
(1) Segregated as a distinct unit where practicable. 
(2) Organized with the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grades 
into a six-year high school in small cities and rural 
communities. 
(3) Inclusion of grades seven to ten where “an existing 
second or third class high school is dependent upon 
this type of organization.” 
(4) Housing the junior high school with the first six grades 
if local conditions require it: but, in that case, the 
junior high school principal is to exercise supervisory 
authority over both divisions. 
(II) Enrollment and faculty 
(1) A minimum of enrollment of one hundred pupils and a 
faculty of four teachers. 
(2) Incase the initial organization does not exceed seventy- 
five pupils and a staff of three teachers, the school will be 
recognized as a junior high school for two years only. 
(8) Departmental organization provided as _ follows: 
(a) English and foreign language; (b) social studies; 
(c) mathematics; and (d) geography, science, and 
health. 
(4) The principal shall be given time for the supervision and 
administration of the schools’ guidance program, the 
school activities, and other executive duties. 
(IIT) Organization 
(1) Music, drawing, industrial, agricultural, commercial, 
and home economics should be taught on a part-time 
arrangement with adjoining or nearby districts. 
(2) Each class unit should be under the control and guid- 
ance of a home-room councillor. 
(3) Definite time allotment should be provided for school 
activities. ‘These should include (a) home-roem guid- 
ance period once weekly; (6) weekly assembly; 
(c) codperative pupil government; (d) clubs.

  JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL STANDARDS 401 
(4) Promotion by subject should prevail throughout the 
school. 
(5) The guidance and educational placement of pupils 
through exploration and testing of pupil choices should 
be accepted as a primary purpose of the junior high 
school. Guidance should permeate the program of 
studies and every activity. 
There should be a minimum school year of nine months, 
a school day of six hours, and six one-hour periods. 
The sixty-minute period should provide for supervised 
study, the period usually being divided into three parts ; 
namely, (a) for recitation or socialized presentation of 
yesterday’s lesson; (b) a carefully planned and definite 
assignment of today’s lesson; and (c) silent study 
under direction of today’s lesson. 
(IV) Curriculum requirement 
(1) There should be four major branches (English, social 
studies, mathematics, geography and science), and a 
fifth grouping of arts courses. 
(2) An introductory and exploratory commercial course 
of three periods should be provided in the first part 
of the eighth grade. 
(3) Health and physical education should be included as a 
special activity under physical instructors, or included 
in the schedule of some other teacher. 
(4) A course of not less than five lessons per semester should 
be given in the use of books and the library. 
(V) Teachers’ qualifications 
(1) All teachers must hold some kind of state certificate. 
(VI) Building requirements 
(1) The junior high school should include classrooms, home 
rooms, and facilities for industrial arts and agriculture, 
home economics, an auditorium, a gymnasium, and a 
library. 
(2) A playground of at least thirty square feet per pupil 
shall be provided in other than rural districts; in rural 
districts, not less than one acre shall be provided. 
It is clear from the formulations quoted above that unity 
of judgments is fast being developed — at least in respect 
to certain fundamental principles. (6

  402 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
WISCONSIN REQUIREMENTS 
Several states have passed laws relating to the junior high 
school. The provisions of the Wisconsin law (1919) are as 
follows: 
Any district maintaining a district free high school, a union free 
high school, or a graded school in which five or more teachers are 
employed may establish and maintain one or more junior high 
schools in the manner hereinafter provided. The laws relating to 
district and union free high schools shall govern in the establishment 
and maintenance of junior high schools in so far as such laws are 
applicable, except as hereinafter provided. 
No junior high school shall be organized in a district where 
the aggregate enrollment of pupils in the seventh and eighth grades 
for the preceding year shall have been less than 40. 
A junior high school organized in a district maintaining a 
district or union free high school or the equivalent thereof shall be 
composed only of grades seven to nine, inclusive. 
A junior high school shall employ at least three teachers, one 
of whom shall be qualified to teach manual training or agriculture 
and one of whom shall be qualified to teach domestic science. 
TEN STANDARDS FOR THE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL 
D. E. Phillips, writing for the School Review for March, 
1919, frames a decalogue which he believes should be followed 
in establishing a junior high school. Although the ten 
standards are inadequate, the doctrine is acceptable. 
(1) Under wise guidance there shall be almost unlimited freedom 
in the choice of subjects. 
(2) Any student shall be freely promoted in any single subject or 
to any grade at any time he is able to accomplish the work of 
that study or grade, without regard to how much time he 
has spent on previous courses. 
(3) The junior high school must finally include much material 
not now in the grades or in the first year of the high school. 
(4) Sound scientific vocational guidance shall be a part of every 
junior high school. 
(5) The future junior high school shall provide ample oppor-

(6) Departmental teaching is necessary to the highest efficiency 
in junior high school work. 
(7) Properly supervised study is desirable everywhere, but 
imperative in the junior high school. 
(8) When the future junior high school is adequately established, 
the regular high school must be adjusted to this new shrine 
of the golden age, and not vice versa. 
(9) We must create and train a special class of teachers for the 
junior high school. 
(10) The dominant aim of the junior high school must be to 
encourage, to inspire to somé purpose in life. 
These various reports constitute probably the best advice 
and the best sets of positive suggestions for general guidance 
that can be formulated at present. Boards of education and 
school administrators are urged to weigh carefully the 
recommendations.

    CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO 
Tuer OUTLOOK FOR THE FUTURE 
HE test of any scheme is: Does it work? Until within 
the past few years there was not sufficient evidence at 
hand to warrant positive assertions concerning the accom- 
plishments of the junior high school, and the claims for the 
newly organized school rested largely upon an a priori base. 
Not so today. From many sides come expressions of 
commendation. 
Superintendent P. W. Horn of Houston, Texas, says: 
Year before last we determined to inaugurate the policy of junior 
high schools and we erected two magnificent junior high school 
buildings. These schools were intended to meet the needs of that 
large group of children for whom neither the high school nor the 
elementary school has previously made adequate provision, and 
many of whom have as a result been dropping out of school. One 
of the prominent features in our history during the past school year 
has been our effort to carry out the junior high school idea and to 
meet more nearly the needs of the children of this group. 
It is needless to say that this task has not as yet been fully 
completed. School systems do not ordinarily grow by revolution 
or by miracle. Their perfecting is a matter of steady growth and 
slow development. While I am sure that our junior high schools 
have accomplished a great deal during the past year, I am equally 
sure that it will take several years for them to become fully estab- 
lished and several years more for their results to be fully measured 
or appraised. 
One of the first things which our experience showed is that you 
cannot establish a junior high school by merely cutting off one year 
of the elementary schools and two years of the high school, putting 
these under one building, and calling them a junior high school. 
There might or might not be a certain amount of good in this 
simple process, but its effect for either good or evil would be very 
limited. ‘The junior high school is not an elementary school. 
Neither is it a high school. Neither is it a sort of mixture of the 
two in equal proportions. If it is in reality an institution worthy 
406
-P-A-G-E-417
  THE OUTLOOK FOR THE FUTURE 407 
of its place in our educational economy, it is an institution which is 
neither an elementary school nor a high school, but a provision for 
the needs of those children for which neither of the older institutions 
made suitable provision. It partakes to some extent of the nature 
of each, but it is essentially different from either. 
The chief difficulty in the way of making the junior high school 
reach its full measure of success lies in establishing a clear-cut 
junior high school idea in the minds of all concerned. It is by no 
means easy to get the teachers to understand fully just what they 
are trying to do. The idea too frequently is that the junior high 
school is merely a section of the old high school sawed off and nailed 
together with a strip similarly sawed off from the elementary school. 
This conception spells failure in advance. There is particularly 
a tendency to copy the old high school plan, with its vices as well as 
its virtues. As a result of our last year’s experience, it is my obser- 
vation that teachers who have had university training but have 
been doing elementary school work come nearer grasping the junior 
high school ideal and realizing it than do teachers whose only 
experience within recent years has been in high school work. 
Superintendent Horn subsequently summed up _ the 
advantage of the junior high school thus: 
It is the opinion of the writer, and of all others who have studied 
the junior high school movement in Houston, that good results have 
materialized from it. No miracles have been worked, and none 
need be expected. It is a pleasure, however, to re-state the advan- 
tages which we have found to come from our junior high schools. 
The list is largely, though not wholly, the same that was given in 
the annual report of the Houston schools two years ago. It is as 
follows : 
(1) More pupils are kept in school. 
(2) Teachers are better able to specialize. 
(3) There are more men teachers for older pupils. 
(4) The change in school methods comes with the change from 
youth to adolescence. 
(5) Change from grammar school methods to high school 
methods is made less abrupt. 
(6) Methods of discipline are better suited to pupils of adoles- 
cent age.

  408 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
(7) Earlier opportunity is given for the election of subjects. 
(8) Pupils save time through earlier opportunity to take addi- 
tional subjects. | 
(9) Promotion by subjects instead of by grades is introduced 
earlier. 
(10) High school is brought geographically nearer the homes of 
the pupils. 
(11) Increased attention is given to industrial training. 
(12) Increased attention is given to physical education. Swim- 
ming pool, gymnasium, etc., made this possible. 
(13) A better stopping place is provided for those who must take 
up the work of breadwinning without four full years in high school. 
(14) A larger senior high school and larger graduating classes are 
possible, as a result of better methods below. More high school 
graduates go to college. 
(15) There is better opportunity for proper supervision of study 
periods. 
(16) Opportunity for much needed reorganization of entire high 
school course of study is offered. 
(17) Change of viewpoint in the teaching of each subject in the 
course of study has resulted. 
All these advantages have been shown by our three years of 
experience actually to arise from junior high school work. As we 
all learn more about the movement, and as more of us grasp the . 
junior high school point of view, it is only to be expected that these 
advantages will be intensified. 
      
    
        
   
      
    
           
      
        From Duluth, Minnesota, comes the following testimony : 
Junior high schools were established in Duluth four years ago, 
and we feel that at the present time we are able to make some 
definite statement on their value as a part of a school system. .. . 
All 6 A students, previous to entering the junior high school, are 
given a general intelligence test. This year we used the National 
Intelligence Test. These tests are given to assist in dividing the 
students, upon their entry to the junior high schools, into groups 
according to their general ability as nearly as can be done. It is 
expected that those groups of higher intelligence levels will be 
required to do more work than those of lower intelligence, but that 
all who pass the beginning grade — 7 B we term it in the junior high 
school — must come up to a certain minimum standard which is
-P-A-G-E-419
  THE OUTLOOK FOR THE FUTURE 409 
set by the course of study. These different groups are maintained 
straight through all their classes. That is, group A remains the 
same list of students in all the subjects. Separate mixed groups 
are maintained for students who have failed. 
Over-age and over-size pupils may be and frequently are ad- 
mitted to the junior high school. These pupils are given courses to 
fit their needs. Their classes are determined by conference with 
pupil, teachers, parents, and the principal of the junior high school 
as circumstances demand. ‘The point, from the administrative 
side, is that the pupil is not required to study all the subjects in the 
regular curriculum. We have students who spend one half of their 
time or more in the shops, students who come to school half time, 
CCl 
There are three main ideas fundamental to the philosophy of 
the so-called pre-vocational course : 
First: The courses are to be made practical so as to have general 
education value as indicated above. 
Second: Through correlation of the shop work with the English 
work, the arithmetic work, and the art work as given by the other 
teachers, it is possible for the shop subjects to make real to the 
boys and girls the work of the other classes. . . 
Third: A series of shop activities enables both pupil and kentins 
to reach some conclusion as regards the aptitudes and abilities of 
individual students. This naturally leads to some educational 
guidance which may result in the later years, the ninth and tenth, 
in vocational guidance. 
The vocational guidance of the junior high school is more 
negative than positive in that it enables both teacher and pupils to 
eliminate those subjects in which it is evident the pupil has small 
aptitude and ability. 
In one class we have kept the records of those students for the 
four years in which the junior high schools have been in operation, 
and we find that the negative guidance amounted to 75 per cent 
and that the positive guidance amounted to 25 per cent. Of that 
25 per cent positive guidance, all the students have continued 
in the field of work which they selected in that class, either by 
continuing in technical and higher education or by going out into 
actual employment in the previously selected field of work. 
This is only one of the results which we have been able to trace. 
There is positive evidence of an increase in enrollment, and also an
-P-A-G-E-420
  410 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
added percentage of pupils continuing their education from the 
eighth year into the high school. For example, in the Irving Junior 
High School, six years ago 56 per cent of the girls from the eighth 
grade went on into the high school. For the last two years, in this 
school, 98 per cent of the girls have gone into the Senior High 
School and a large percentage of these are continuing to gradua- 
ORG ds 
Junior high schools, through promotion by subject and depart- 
mental work, offer an opportunity for students to succeed in those 
lines in which they are gifted, without being compelled to lose a 
whole year because of failure to complete some particular subject 
in which they have not equal ability. 
Through the auxiliary group activities, such as the orchestra, 
debating, athletics, camera club, girls’ sewing clubs, and activities of 
this nature, the interest of the boys and girls outside of school 
hours can be kept on something which has real educational value. 
Through the opportunities for self-control and self-government, 
it is possible to develop to a high degree the sense of citizenship 
and community ownership of the school building. Most junior high 
schools have an auditorium where all the children gather together. 
The value of an auditorium to unify the school, to mold the senti- 
ment of the pupils, and to create a wholesome school spirit can 
hardly be estimated. Its value is limited only by the skill of the 
principal and the character of the material which he presents at 
his auditorium session. Certainly there is no greater opportunity 
for improving the civic and moral attitudes of the students than 
that which is given through auditorium meetings.! 
Under date of March 28, 1921, Superintendent J. L. Silver- 
nale, of Menominee, Michigan, wrote as follows: 
It may interest you to know that out of our total enrollment of 
2045 in the kindergarten and grades of the Menominee City Schools 
we have 575 enrolled in grades nine to twelve; that our average 
enrollment in grades seven, eight, and nine exceeds the enrollment 
in grades four, five, and six; and that our enrollment in grades ten, 
eleven, and twelve is within ten of the enrollment of grades four, 
five, and six. We have only thirty-eight non-resident pupils. 
We have a graduating class of one hundred twenty-three, nine of

-P-A-G-E-421
  THE OUTLOOK FOR THE FUTURE 411 
which are non-resident. These figures certainly show that we have 
been able, by our reorganization begun five years ago, to hold our 
pupils in school as they are not being held elsewhere. 
The 1920 census gave Menominee a population of 8907. I 
believe our success in holding our boys and girls in school fully 
warrants us in continuing along the present lines of organization. 
In the Journal of Education for January 27, 1916, page 21, 
Dr. A. E. Winship summed up the reorganization idea in the 
following words: 
The junior high school does all this in education. It must never 
be thought of as a “high” school, but it is more than an elementary 
school, where every lesson is assigned in detail, every direction given 
specifically, and every result checked with anxious care. There is 
nothing of this in the junior high school. The lessons are assigned 
more generally, the directions are few and not in detail, and the 
results are checked with less thought as to what they are than as to 
their significance in the growth and development of independence in 
thought and action on the part of the student. It is precisely what 
it is in the training team in athletics, — a four-bagger is the last 
thing aimed at on the diamond, and touchdowns and kicking goals 
are the last achievements on the gridiron. 
The junior high school is the training squad for higher studies or 
for active life. It is not so serious a matter to leave school at the 
end of a junior high school course, but it is civically, industrially, 
commercially, educationally criminal for a student to leave school 
without the peculiar training that he gets in the junior high school, 
a training that is not available in the traditional elementary school. 
Briggs, in his Junior High School, presents statistical data 
which tend to show that where junior high schools have been 
established the following outcomes have, in general, been 
noticed : 
(1) An increased enrollment in the grades concerned. 
(2) An increase in regularity of attendance. 
(3) An increased persistence in the school. 
(4) An increase in the percentage of promotions. 
(5) At least no less ability to pursue, with success, the advanced 
courses in the senior high school.
-P-A-G-E-422
  412 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION 
(6) A tendency for a large percentage of the pupils not to con- 
tinue, in the senior high school, the work begun as electives 
in the junior high school — showing possibly that the junior 
high school is helping pupils to discover what at least is not 
to their taste two years earlier than formerly had been the 
case. 
(7) An increase in pupil interests in school work. 
(8) An increase in school spirit. 
(9) An increase in community spirit.! 
The educational achievements of the junior high schools 
established by the City of Rochester are described in a notable 
booklet issued in September, 1919, the text of which reads in 
part as follows: 
The Washington Junior High School was opened in September, 
1915, and has, therefore, been in operation just four years. No 
severer test of the power of any school can be found than its ability 
to hold pupils interestedly at their work when compulsory education 
laws no longer require them to attend school. This is what this 
school has accomplished during these four years : 
(1) Before the Washington Junior High School was opened, 
only 50 per cent of all the pupils who completed the eighth 
grade in the elementary schools that contribute to this school 
remained for any further school work. During the four years 
that this school has been in operation more than 90 per cent 
of the pupils who have completed the eighth grade work in 
the school have remained to take the additional year which 
the school offers. When one stops to think that the past 
four years have been years of unprecedented need in many 
homes and of unprecedented temptation for boys and girls 
to withdraw from school because of the high wages which 
they could secure, it would be difficult to find a greater 
testimony to the power and effectiveness of the Junior High 
School than is found in its demonstrated ability to hold pupils 
in school during these past four years. 
(2) Not only has this Junior High School retained this large 
percentage of its eighth grade graduates but it has decreased 
by 15 per cent the number of pupils who were annually

  THE OUTLOOK FOR THE FUTURE 413 
withdrawing from the seventh and eighth grades and thereby 
being deprived even of the advantages of an elementary 
school education. 
The Washington Junior High School has not only held these 
pupils in school but it has given to each group of pupils the kind of 
education which that group needed for its particular work. Those 
pupils, for example, who were to enter the general or college pre- 
paratory courses of the upper high school, have been grouped to- 
gether and prepared definitely for their later work in mathematics 
and foreign language, as it had not been possible to prepare them 
formerly. ‘These are the pupils from whom the professional voca- 
tions of life are recruited. But the home, industry, and commerce 
of our community likewise require their own special forms of train- 
ing. Hitherto our schools have failed to recognize this. Those 
who, through choice or necessity, are to enter upon these vocations 
are likewise grouped according to their special needs and given a 
preparation quite as valuable to them and to the community as is 
the preparation given to those who are to enter other vocations. 
Thus the junior high school not only holds the pupil in school but it 
strives intelligently to discover special needs and special abilities 
and to develop these special needs and abilities just so far as is 
consistent with the demands of general education. 
The Board of Superintendents of the City of Boston has 
published statistics showing certain advantages that thecity 
has gained by following the new plan. 
(1) They relieved the congestion in the over-crowded four-year 
high schools. 
(2) They resulted in a saving of $70,000 in 1920-1921, because 
1390 ninth-grade pupils were taught by intermediate school 
teachers and in intermediate school buildings rather than in 
the four-year high schools. 
(8) They held into the ninth grade more than 11 per cent more 
pupils who finished the eighth grade than did the four-year 
high school that drew pupils directly from the eighth grade 
of the elementary schools. 
(4) The attainments of pupils in the tenth grade suffered in no 
conspicuous way by comparison with the pupils who had 
the ninth grade work in the four-year high school. On the
-P-A-G-E-424

other hand, it was frankly acknowledged that the grades 
gained in that grade by former junior high school pupils 
were not noticeably better.! 
Finally, the fact that new junior high schools are being 
organized in all parts of the country is pretty good evidence 
that advocates of the plan have faith: in their vision and are 
convincing taxpayers and boards of education that their 
vision can be realized. | , 
Just how many true junior high schools there are in exist- 
ence today is difficult to determine. As has been said, all 
depends on definitions. Briggs states that up to the spring 
of 1917 eight hundred had been reported ; but his own further 
analyses reduced the actual numbers to fewer than half the 
original figures. The United States Bureau of Education is 
authority for the statement that in 1920, in all cities of five 
thousand population or more, there were reported 354 such 
schools. These figures do not take into account the many 
junior high schools claimed by numerous smaller towns and 
semi-rural communities. If these are included the numbers 
exceed 550. 
That some discrepancies exist among the figures quoted is 
probably true. For example, the Bureau of Education 
credits Ohio with thirty-eight such schools, while Rorem, in 
The Junior High School Clearing House for March-April, 
1921, ascribes more than sixty of these schools to Ohio. 
Similarly, the report of the Bureau of Education gives 
Michigan twenty-two junior high schools, whereas a recent 
canvass indicates that the numbers run something above 
thirty. 
It is obvious from these conflicting data that no one knows 
how many junior high schools there are at present in our 
country. It appears evident, however, that the number lies 
somewhere between three hundred and a thousand. When 
1 School Document No. 19, pages 46 et seq., 1920.
-P-A-G-E-425
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE FUTURE 415 
one reads that the high schools of the land number 13,951,! 
the junior high school movement appears, by comparison, 
somewhat puny and disappointing. Not so, however. The 
evidence is abundant and cumulative that the reorganization 
work is going on in almost all quarters. It is sufficient to 
say that, whatever the number of existing schools may be, 
the institution is here to stay. With Detroit, in one year, 
appropriating $12,000,000 for the erection of junior high 
school buildings; with Buffalo appropriating $6,000,000 for 
new junior high school buildings; with Cleveland adopting 
a similar educational and building policy; with the entire 
State of California on record as supporting the reorganization 
plan; and with other states and cities busily engaged in 
studying the question, it is only a matter of time when the 
junior high schools not only will outnumber the senior high 
schools but, like them, will be properly standardized. 
Of all the cities that have taken definite steps to develop 
junior high schools, Fort Wayne, Indiana, is the only one of 
importance that has reversed its policy and abandoned the 
idea. The reasons advanced for the change of front are: 
(1) increase in student failures in making grades; (2) exces- 
sive costs; (3) weariness of the public for “sham pretenses.” 
If these were truly the causes underlying the action taken by 
Fort Wayne, then it is a fair question to ask whether Fort 
Wayne ever had a true junior high school. 
From the evidence at hand, it seems clear that the junior 
high school is firmly established'as a permanent unit in the 
American public school system. It seemingly is destined 
to grow in favor and to increase in strength very rapidly 
within the next few years. It has a unique mission to per- 
form. It is the country’s great opportunity school, designed 
to arouse the ambitions of the youths of the land, inspire

them with a desire to realize their potentialities to the fullest 
possible degree, and guide them in ways that will make for 
individual satisfaction and social well-being. Accordingly, 
the junior high school is neither a sub-secondary school nor 
a vocational or trade school. It is distinctly and confessedly 
an exploratory school. Its essential function is to provide 
outlooks, overviews, introductions to a world organized as 
the workshop and playground of man, and to help each youth 
to discover the most effective method of adjusting himself to 
that world in a satisfactory manner. The junior high school 
is, therefore, general in its aims and liberal in its outcomes. 
It is essentially a try-out and an information school. It 
aims to do for the many what colleges of literature, sciences, 
and the arts seek to accomplish for the few — to give the 
elements of a liberal culture. Its relations to the senior high 
school are precisely the same as are those of the liberal arts 
college to the professional schools. Its aims, therefore, 
should be general, its curriculum general, its results general.

READING LISTS AND STUDY HELPS 443 
(III) STUDY HELPS 
The following list of study helps, by Dr. J. C. Brown, is particu- 
larly appropriate for junior high school students :! 
(1) Determine by trial your best time for study, then use that 
time whenever it is possible. 
(2) Have regular hours for study and a regular sequence of hours 
for each subject. 
(3) Determine by trial whether you succeed best by beginning 
with the easiest or the most difficult subjects. 
(4) Conserve your energies for studies. Take enough sleep and 
exercise. 
(5) Do not attempt to study when the brain is fatigued. 
(6) See to it that external conditions are favorable for study : 
(a) The room as quiet and free from other distractions as 
possible. 
(b) A good light properly placed. 
(c) The temperature of the room 65 to 68 degrees. 
(d) The humidity of the room relatively high. 
(e) The desk or table and the chair neither too high nor too 
low. 
(f) The clothing loose enough, especially about the neck. 
(7) Have ready all the materials that you will need. 
(8) Lose no time in starting to work. 
(9) Try to develop a high degree of concentration for the work 
to be done. 
(10) Be sure that you understand exactly what the assign- 
ment is. 
(11) Have a clear notion of the purpose of the assignment. 
(12) Review rapidly the principal points in the previous assign- 
ment. 
(13) Read the assignment rather rapidly and try to determine 
the most important points of the lesson. 
(14) Go over the assignment a second time with great care. 
Try to associate facts with the important headings or principles 
involved. 
(15) Do not attempt to memorize material that is not under- 
stood. 
(16) Try to evaluate the various statements made by the author. 
! The School Magazine, Buffalo, New York, pages 21-22, April, 1919.
-P-A-G-E-454
  444 APPENDIX 
(17) After you have gone over the assignment with great care, 
make an outline or a synopsis of it. Use this in reviewing. 
(18) Try to supplement the thoughts and illustrations of the 
author. 
(19) Use freely the appendix, table of contents, index, footnotes, 
and maps. 
(20) Verify references whenever it is possible. 
(21) Learn when and how to read rapidly. 
(22) Learn to use the library. 
(23) Do all that you can before securing aid from any other 
source. 
(24) Do your studying before discussing the assignment with 
others. 
(25) Use visual and auditory imagery as an aid to recall. Use 
also motor activity for this purpose. 
(26) Work with the intent to learn and remember. 
(27) In general, use in studying the form of activity that will be 
demanded when the material is to be used. 
(28) Break long periods of study by brief periods of relaxation. 
(29) Strive to excel your own record for quality of work and to 
shorten the time necessary for adequate preparation. 
(30) Stimulate your efforts with the thought of competition 
decidedly superior. 
(31) Realize that you are working for yourself, not for the 
teacher. 
(32) Be very attentive in class. Strive to develop a high degree 
of interest in the subject. Interest tends to beget interest. 
(83) Prepare each assignment thoroughly. Do not fall behind 
in this respect. 
(34) Use the knowledge or skill required whenever there is 
opportunity. 
(35) Do not attempt to carry too heavy a program. Do 
thoroughly all that you do. 
(86) Mark your own books in such a way that the more impor- 
tant points may be rapidly reviewed by use of the book, if desired. 
(37) Read current articles on the general subject when possible.

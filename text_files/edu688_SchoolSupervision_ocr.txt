  INTRODUCTION 
A NEw type of text-book is now in process of making. This 
book is evidence of the fact. A century ago matters were far 
different. Then the author was expected to hand out to the 
student a careful formulation of ‘‘the correct” position and the 
student was required to learn this “by heart” and recite it to 
the teacher. Aside from the effort at memorizing the student 
was passive throughout. His duty was to accept what was told 
him. To doubt or question was impudence or worse. Later 
the reformers saw the inadequacy of mere rote memorizing, 
and demanded that the student “understand” what he was 
“learning.” The student’s activity might even go so far as to 
“give in his own words” what he had “‘learned.” 
In our later times, still greater student activity is counted 
necessary. No longer will one formulated statement suffice. 
Thoughts cannot be given out whole in such fashion. We now 
see that if the student’s knowledge is to be his in any true sense, 
be in fact knowledge and not mere information, then the student 
must himself have come to that knowledge through a serious 
and complex effort. He must first have encountered difficulties, 
have felt doubts; he must then examine possible solutions to 
these difficulties; must see wherein and how one solution fails 
to satisfy and another better satisfies. If one has not engaged 
in such a course of personal individual mental activity, moving 
back and forth over the field of thought, he cannot justifiably 
say that he thinks thus or so, still less can he say that he knows 
this or that to be true. Nor is this all. Unless the student 
vii 
 
-P-A-G-E-8
vil INTRODUCTION 
has gone through such an active thought process, he can have 
little hope that in his time of need his knowledge will serve 
him. Only when knowledge has been worked over into the 
very constitution of one’s own thought processes can it be 
relied upon to function effectively in meeting life’s situations. 
It is with such thoughts in mind, I take it, that Mr. Grant 
has made this book. Here no ready-made ready-to-be-accepted 
thoughts are handed out to docile students. Quite the con- 
trary. Whoever goes through this book in the fashion here 
outlined will surely think, and thinking thus will, I most firmly 
believe, come from the study with a greatly increased stock of 
thoughts worked over into the very warp and woof of his own 
mind. Such thoughts so held will serve efficiently when the 
call shall come. In James’ phrase, I defy anyone to go through 
this book according to directions and not really learn or learn- 
ing not to profit. Such a text-book is a contribution to Ameri- 
can education. With its coming a better day is brought nearer.

PREFACE 
CHARACTER building is the teacher’s greatest work. How 
well she succeeds depends upon her skillin teaching. A majority 
of our teachers begin work with less skill than they themselves 
desire. Even the trained teachers are seeking further guidance. 
Superintendents, principals, and supervisors are constantly look- 
ing for material that can be used by teachers for their improve- 
ment. The purpose of this book is to guide the reading, 
thinking, and practice of student teachers and teachers in serv- 
ice. Each chapter is composed of a number of short pedagogical 
Statements. Most of these statements are true. Some of them 
are questionable. The teachers are asked to state in the light 
of modern educational thought why each statement is or is not 
true. 
In preparing this book the author has also kept in mind those 
students who wish to improve in service through correspondence 
work. The readings on each chapter are definite. The student 
writes his paper by telling why the statements are or are not 
true. 
The author is indebted to more people than he can mention. 
Many of his teachers, colleagues, and students can find their 
statements in this book. The author is especially grateful to 
the following people for reading the manuscript and offering 
helpful suggestions: J. L. Bond, State Superintendent Public 
Instruction, Little Rock, Arkansas; Frederick G. Bonser, 
Professor of Education, Teachers College, Columbia University ; 
Norman Frost, Professor of Rural Education, Peabody College 
for Teachers; Newell D. Gilbert, Dean of Northern Illinois

ment is made to Professor William Heard Kilpatrick for his 
Introduction to this text. The author is especially indebted 
to his wife for rendering valuable assistance on each chapter. 
If reflection on these statements and the group discussions 
that should follow are helpful in the improvement of teachers, 
in bringing about a better community spirit, and in causing 
parents, teachers, and boards of education to codperate in 
solving their common problems, the purpose of this book will 
have been accomplished.

SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY 
Tue method emphasized in this book will encourage dis- 
cussions, but discussions are of no value unless they help members 
of the group to reach worth while conclusions. The period may 
be used unwisely by one or two members who enjoy prolonging 
theoretical discussions and hair-splitting distinctions or in mere 
rambling talk. In any class or group of teachers where ques- 
tions are to be settled, the individual members may hinder 
progress by talking too much or too little. No member wishes 
to hinder progress; therefore each member of the class should 
examine himself or herself to see what value his or her presence 
means to the welfare of the entire group. 
Following each chapter is a large number of suggested read- 
ings, but no one is expected to read all these references. After 
the reading has been done, the teachers should come together 
for further study. Each teacher should do her own thinking, 
always being able to give reasons for her opinions. The teachers 
may not agree on all statements, but they should not waste 
time in debating when it is evident that the question cannot be 
settled. It is often as valuable to raise questions as to settle 
them. After the true statements have been agreed upon, it 
may be well to arrange them in logical order around two or more 
main topics. 
All questions will never be settled, but unless the close of 
each period finds the members of the class agreeing on a number 
of outstanding principles of teaching, the period has meant very 
little to the growth of the individual members. It would be 
well for time to be taken at the close of the period for a summary 
x1
-P-A-G-E-12
xii SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY 
of conclusions. No meeting should close with the members of 
the group feeling that nothing definite was accomplished. It 
should always be kept in mind that the statements are to pro- 
mote study, not argument. 
In taking a class through a book of this nature, the teacher 
should do even more planning than for the usual type of text. 
The teacher must not only guide the discussions, but she should 
know when they are going nowhere and when they should be 
dropped. In a democratic recitation or group meeting, all 
members should hold themselves responsible for helping to 
guide the discussions to valuable conclusions. 
Not what one knows but what one does is often the thing that 
counts. A teacher who knows a pedagogical principle and does 
not put it into practice, is very little better than the teacher who 
has never heard of the principle. No teacher should agree that 
a statement is true, unless she is willing to put it into practice. 
In large groups, there are always some modest teachers who 
do not take an active part. Where the group is large, the teach- 
ers will do well to divide themselves into small study groups 
meeting before the regular time for the class or group discussion. 
This will encourage individual thinking and expression. More- 
over, by settling some of the questions in the study groups 
time will be saved so that, in the regular meetings, attention 
may be centered on the more important statements. 
Many of the topics in this book may be used as programs 
for community clubs, study clubs, faculty meetings, teachers’ 
institutes, parent-teacher associations, etc. 
Not all the topics or the special statements in those topics 
in this book should necessarily be studied by one group in one 
school year. No two groups or classes have the same problems. 
The problems of each group are continually changing. Discus- 
sions should be limited to living problems.

CHAPTER I 
THE TEACHER, THE SCHOOL, AND THE COMMUNITY 
I. APPLICANTS 
As a rule teachers have not lived in the community 
where they are teaching long enough to entitle them to 
vote. They are not citizens of the community. Too 
often their interests are elsewhere, and it is “your 
community,” rather than “our community.” They 
sometimes say to themselves, ‘I would not live here 
at all, but I can stand anything for a little while.” 
It is hoped the time will soon come when more com- 
munities can have, for twelve months each year, mature 
teachers who are good leaders and who are worthy to be 
followed by adults as well as children. Such teachers 
would be real citizens of the community and would 
help it in every way possible. 
Since most applicants are strangers to the superin- 
tendent, and since teachers often leave the community 
as soon as the school is out, it behooves the school 
board to be careful in selecting teachers. Any appli- 
cant can get “to-whom-it-may-concern”’ testimonials 
but superintendents are losing faith in them.

II. QUALIFICATIONS OF A GOOD TEACHER 
There have been many statements made about the 
good teacher. Some of the statements are true; 
others are questionable. Most of the statements 
given below have been made by teachers and pupils 
in naming the qualifications of their best teachers. 
Examine each statement carefully and tell why you 
do or do not think it is true for all good teachers. 
After you have selected the qualifications of a good 
teacher, check the ones that are possessed by the 
“average” teacher of your province. Select the ones 
that can be acquired by any teacher. Tell how they 
may be acquired. 
1. Her age is somewhere between twenty-one and fifty-five. 
2. She is good looking. 
3. She thoroughly enjoys her work. 
\ 4. She understands and loves children. 
5. yShe enjoys children’s games. 
6. She is full of stories and can tell them well. 
7. She does not bring her personal sorrows into the school- 
room.

She adapts herself to the community in which she 
teaches. 
She can get very angry, but she has her temper under 
good control. 
She is always sincere. 
She does not copy or imitate, but is original in all that 
she does. 
She lays aside fun while in the schoolroom. ~ 
She loves all her pupils equally well. 
She treats all her pupils alike. 
She tells the truth on all occasions. 
Children know a good teacher. They are right when 
they say: 
“ She takes an interest in us.” 
“She does not scold.” 
“ She has no pets.” 
“ She is one of us.” 
‘She means what she says.” 
“She thinks before she speaks.” 
‘She has a pure character.” 
“She is a broad-minded friend.” 
She is always prompt, both in school and out. 
She is always tactful, neat, polite, kind, friendly, and 
cheerful.

She is patient and cool-headed at all times. 
She is not disturbed by criticisms made of her by patrons. 
She is willing to serve her community and let others 
get the credit for her work. She is willing to be 
forgotten. 
She will not complain about her environment, such as 
her associates, boarding place, school equipment, etc. 
She thinks more of helping children than she does of 
studying books. She thinks more of helping others 
than of helping herself. 
She has as much influence in the community at large as 
she has in the school. 
She has no bad habits. 
A teacher failed on examination. She was permitted 
to teach, because she was a power for good. This was 
right. 
Examinations do not enable a superintendent to select 
good teachers. Some of our best scholars are our 
poorest teachers. We should employ teachers on trial. 
If they win the love, confidence, and respect of the 
children ; if they raise the moral plane of living; if they 
cause their pupils to be kind, considerate, and courteous ; 
if they inspire their pupils to be and do their best every 
day, they should be retained even if they are not able 
to pass an examination. On the other hand, if they fail 
to win the love, confidence, and respect of their pupils ; 
if they do not raise the moral plane of living; if they do 
not cause their pupils to be kind, considerate, and 
courteous; if they do not inspire their pupils to be and 
do their best every day, they should not be retained, 
even if they have been graduated from the best college 
in the country.

II. THE TEACHER AND HER WORK 
The teacher is a social worker. Social workers 
cannot succeed unless they know and understand the 
people with whom and for whom they work. Educa- 
tion is a process of adjustment. The teacher who can- 
not adjust herself to her community or who is a “‘mis- 
fit” cannot hope to succeed. A teacher, to succeed, 
must have the respect and confidence of her pupils and 
patrons. Too often patrons are heard to say, ‘The 
teacher is not our kind. She belongs to another class.” 
This feeling on the part of the patrons is a serious 
handicap to any teacher. There are teachers who can 
succeed in one place, but who would fail in another. 
For example, the rural community demands a rural-

Iv. A TEACHER’S PERSONALITY 
Every citizen has something to sell. A person’s 
ability as a salesman depends largely upon his person- 
ality. Every one would like to have a good personality. 
“Tf I had her personality I could accomplish much 
more,” is a statement that one often hears. 
Superintendents want to see the applicant to study 
her personality. If she has a good personality, she 
will not only stand a better chance to secure the
-P-A-G-E-25
THE SCHOOL AND THE COMMUNITY , 13 
position but her chances for success in the community 
are much better. 
If there are ways of improving the personality, the 
teacher deserves to know them. Below is given a list 
of statements on personality. Study each one and be 
able to tell why you think it is or is not good. Select 
the statements which most vitally concern the teacher.

15. A teacher’s personality is all that she means to others. 
Since a teacher does not mean the same to all people, she 
has different personalities for different people. 
Every person has a personality. 
No person with a poor personality can be a good teacher. 
A good personality is natural, not acquired. 
A man might shave his head without changing his per- 
sonality. 
Man (in the generic sense) is the only animal that has a 
personality. 
The clothes which one wears help make up one’s per- 
sonality. 
Personality is composed of three parts, viz.: (a) the 
physical, (b) the mental, (c) the moral. 
One’s personality, physical, mental, or moral, depends 
upon how one has been reared. 
Any one who will try can have an attractive person- 
ality. 
No one can practice the Golden Rule without developing 
a good personality. 
No one can live a wicked life without developing a poor 
personality. 
One who speaks poor English has a ‘poor personality. 
A little powder and paint help one’s personality.

. One’s clothes do not help to determine personality, but 
personality will determine the kind of clothes worn. 
One’s personality is continually changing; sometimes 
for better, and sometimes for worse. 
No person in poor health can have a personality attractive 
to children, 
One’s physique does not add to or detract from his per- 
sonality. 
Any one with a poor personality will have a bad influence 
upon children. 
Any one with a good personality will have a good in- 
fluence. 
A person who is lazy, timid, selfish, or careless cannot 
have a good personality. 
A teacher who reads a great deal, who visits other schools, 
and who attends summer schools and teachers’ meet- 
ings, will develop a good personality. 
No one can over-eat, dissipate, lose sleep, “sow wild 
oats,” etc., without weakening his personality. 
A person who is unprepared, who is afraid, or who lacks 
self-confidence has a poor personality. 
No person should be held responsible for his person- 
ality.

V. WHAT TO DO BEFORE THE FIRST DAY OF 
SCHOOL 
“Well begun is half done” and “The first impression 
is the most lasting” are sayings that apply to the 
teacher’s first day of school. ‘‘Preparedness” for the 
first day should be the teacher’s slogan. The well 
prepared teacher seldom becomes nervous. Prepared- 
ness, mental, physical, social, or financial, causes one 
to feel at ease. The teacher who does not make long 
and careful preparations for the first day is taking a 
dangerous risk. ‘Teachers and patrons differ as to the 
detailed preparations that should be made for the first 
day. The following statements have been made re- 
garding the necessary things to do before the first day 
of school. Examine each statement carefully. From 
them select the things which you think should be done 
before the first day. Add such others as you think 
necessary. 
1. Make yourself realize that you are about to become the 
leader of a community. 
2. Visit the homes of your patrons and study the environ- 
ment. 
3. Know your pupils and be able to call them by name. 
4. Learn all you can from the superintendent or supervis- 
ing teacher and principal. 
5. Spend at least one day with your predecessor, getting 
helpful information. 
6. Have your predecessor tell you all about the “mean” 
pupils.

EXERCISES 
1. Reéxamine the statements made above and tell which 
ones apply to rural teachers and which ones apply to 
city teachers or to other school officials. 
2. What other preparations should be made by the rural 
teacher? by the city teacher? 
VI. WHAT TO DO THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL 
The first day has come. What is the teacher going 
to do about it? That will depend largely on what she 
has already done about it. This is the “index” day 
for the entire school. This is the day on which teach- 
ers and pupils size each other up. This is the day 
on which the teacher must guard everything she says 
or does. It is a day on which the teacher will start 
the pupils out, or they will start her out. She is on 
trial. Not only should she have her work well planned, 
but before starting to school she should stand before a 
large mirror and see herself as her pupils will see her. 
No one can tell a teacher all the things she should do 
the first day. She must keep her eyes open and do 
what her “hands” find to do. There are a few things, 
however, that a good teacher will do on the first day. 
Some of the following statements may well be ques- 
tioned. Evaluate each one. Make a list of things

16. Start off on the right foot. Get to the school building 
before your pupils do, because it is better for you to see 
them coming than for them to see you coming. 
Have everything in order. Give patrons and pupils a 
hearty welcome. 
Let all pupils choose their own seats. 
For the first day, let pupils select their own way of getting 
into and out of the building. 
There should be several long speeches. 
Help the patrons to feel that it is “our school.” 
The opening exercise should be short, snappy, and in- 
teresting. 
The teacher should talk very little on the first morning. 
Assign lessons from the program written on the board. 
If the teacher does not get all the pupils busy in five 
minutes, they will get her busy. 
Tell pupils what they need, assign the lessons, and dis- 
miss for the day. 
Spend the remainder of the day taking up individual 
problems with parents and pupils. Nothing should , 
be said’ about the predecessor’s weaknesses. 
Keep all pupils for the full day and help them get started. 
Stick closely to the first day’s program as put on the 
board. 
Have recitation benches to which all classes come to 
recite. 
Begin by calling the lower grades. The older pupils can 
keep busy. 
Get to all classes as rapidly as possible, and see that each 
pupil has a recitation in each subject.

1. What else would you do on the first day? 
2. Which of the statements made above might be good for 
some schools, but not for yours? Give reasons for 
your answer. 
VII. A COMMUNITY SURVEY 
A teacher cannot do good work without knowing 
her community. She can get a great deal of informa- 
tion from her pupils. They will be able to give most 
of the information called for below. Only one blank 
is necessary. The teacher can have the pupils answer 
the questions by number. This will enable her not 
only to select the appropriate questions but to get the 
information in a minimum amount of time. Let it be 
understood that the information is not for publication. 
The questions are only suggestive. The teacher should 
add to and subtract from the questions so as to make 
the survey fit the community.

VIII. COOPERATION 
The safety of our country depends, not upon the 
education of a few, but upon the education of the 
masses. No one is educated until he is prepared to 
do something worth while. Nothing is really worth 
while unless it helps to make the world better. The 
time is past when people can succeed without the help 
of others. Society is so interdependent to-day that 
we shall all fail together or succeed together. 
The story is told of two men who were on a sinking 
ship. One of the men was whistling, apparently care- 
free. The other man asked, ‘Why are you so uncon- 
cerned when you know this ship is going to the bottom 
of the ocean?” The man replied, “Why should I 
worry? It is not my ship.” No one is safe until his 
country is safe. Each citizen has a part in making it 
safe. The log rollings we used to have furnished good 
examples of codperation. Not until the group of men 
lifted together was the log moved. 
Each community still has many loads that cannot 
be lifted except through codperation of all the people. 
We are all dependent. No one can have good health 
except as his neighbors codéperate with him in getting 
rid of all conditions that cause disease. One cannot
-P-A-G-E-35
  THE SCHOOL AND THE COMMUNITY 23 
be free from mosquitoes and flies so long as his neighbor 
is unconcerned. Parents cannot bring their children 
up in the way they should go, so long as their neigh- 
bor’s children go uncontrolled. 
Individuals may codperate, families may codperate, 
communities may codperate, but all this will eventu- 
ally fail unless states and nations codperate. Uncivi- 
lized nations codperate very little. Signs are better 
to-day than ever before in the history of the world for 
international codperation. It is to be hoped that this 
spirit of codperation will continue, and that the na- 
tions of the world can spend their time, energy, and 
money in helping their citizens to live rather than in 
helping them to die. 
Codperation comes as a result of education, not 
as a result of legislation. It is equally true that ed- 
ucation comes as a result of codperation. The 
home, the church, the school, and the entire commu- 
nity must codperate before the best education is possi- 
ble. Directors and patrons often make the mistake 
of thinking their work is over when the teachers are 
employed. A good school is the result of codperation 
on the part of the teachers, directors, and patrons. 
Schools exist for no other purpose than to better the 
community. Ifa school is not helping a community it 
is harming it. There are a few schools that are doing 
more harm than good, and it would be a blessing to 
the community if they were closed! Never before 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  24 ACQUIRING SKILL IN TEACHING 
in the history of our nation was there a greater de- 
mand for a good school in each community. Only 
through complete codperation of the teacher, the pa- 
trons, and the directors can this demand be met. 
Evaluate the following statements on what is neces- 
sary before a community can have a good school. 
Tell why each statement is or is not good. 
A. The Teacher's Part

or relatives. 
See that the school is well equipped with good desks, 
blackboards, crayons, erasers, charts, library, etc. 
Visit the school enough to know what is being done. 
Uphold the teacher as long as she is right. 
See that the teacher does not have to be janitor. 
Have a monthly meeting with the teacher, where prob- 
lems are freely discussed. 
So far as possible, do what the teacher wants done. 
Prepare financial statements which show the people how 
their money has been spent. 
Make a budget, showing the people how much money is 
needed and for what it is needed. 
C. The Patrons’ Part 
Before a good school is possible, the patrons must: 
I. Visit the school — not to find fault, but to help the 
teacher help the child. ; 
2. Not adversely criticize the teacher in the presence of the 
children. They should not become angry at what 
they hear until they hear both sides.

Encourage their children to read good literature. 
Encourage helpful and wholesome conversation at home, 
and especially in the presence of their children. 
Become companions to their children and be interested

Help the children at night with their lessons. See that 
they have a good light and a quiet place for study. 
Control their children. They should keep them from 
questionable places. 
See that the children have all necessary school materials. 
Coéperate with the teacher and directors and help pro- 
mote every cause that makes for a better community. 
Nore: Where pupils do not codperate the school will fail, but 
pupils will coéperate when they see parents, teachers, and superin- 
tendents working together for a good school.

Teachers who have no children of their own can- 
not fully appreciate how anxious most parents are in 
regard to the part that schools play in the life and edu-
-P-A-G-E-39
  THE SCHOOL AND THE COMMUNITY 27 
cation of their children. Teachers are sometimes im- 
patient and think parents are meddling. Most parents 
are sincere. They realize that their children are 
usually their greatest contribution to society and that 
the value of this contribution is very likely to depend 
to a very appreciable extent upon what the public 
schools do for their children. 
In the rearing of a child, there is one time which 
thoughtful parents approach with much anxiety; 
namely, the time when the public school begins to 
help determine the child’s destiny. Parents who sit 
idly by are unworthy of the sacred responsibility of 
parenthood. It is easy to help a child get some text- 
book lessons, but to bring a child up in the way it should 
go is impossible unless all forces pull together. The 
teacher who refuses to set forth the school’s point of 
view on the questions asked by parents and patrons 
refuses to codperate. No teacher can discuss these 
questions with parents without getting a broader 
vision of her work and a greater respect for her pro- 
fession. 
The following are some things that parents want to 
know. The worthy teacher has a good answer for 
each question. What is your answer to the questions 
which you think most worth while? 
1. Which is of greater importance, what our children think 
or what they do, what they learn or the way they 
learn it?

portunities and he didn’t.” Is such talk good for a 
community ? 
We want to codperate with our teacher, but she has never 
asked for our codperation. What should we do about 
it? 
How often should parents visit the school? What 
should be the purpose of the visit? What should 
they do while visiting? after visiting? 
We want to be interested in the curriculum, but it is so 
foreign to our life experiences that we find it impossible. 
Are we narrow? Should we broaden out to this sub- 
ject matter? Should the schools meet us half way? 
We have a School Improvement Association (S. I. A.). 
We have improved conditions to the best of our ability 
but in so doing we have been called the School Inter- 
ference Association. Do we deserve it? How may 
we be of the greatest service without interfering? 
We believe in sex education for our boys and girls. We 
want this sacred subject taught on a high moral plane. 
Our present teacher is doing more harm than good 
trying to teach this subject. What can we do about 
it? 
Our child is making poor grades. The teacher has said 
nothing about it except to send us the report card. 
The child says the grades are unjust. What should 
we do about it? 
In school, the children go in gangs or groups. We are 
not satisfied with the group our children are in. What 
determines these groups? Can we not have one 
group that will take in the entire school? If not, then 
how may our children get into a more desirable group? 
If we should move to a new community would our 
children choose better companions?

40. THE SCHOOL AND THE COMMUNITY 31 
Our teacher stays in at recess and reads. She compels 
her pupils to get out and play. Is this right? What 
should we do about it? 
Two boys had a fight in our school. The teacher made 
them shake hands and say, “I forgive you.” The 
boys say they both acted and told a lie. Did the 
teacher do right? 
Should we keep our children in school when they are in- 
terested in nothing but society and athletics? 
Should children be made to go to school when their 
absence is more welcome to the teacher than their 
presence? 
Our children deface school furniture, but take fairly 
good care of the home furniture. What makes the 
difference? 
Three-fourths of our children never reach the high school. 
Should they be given the same kind of instruction as 
the other one-fourth that go on? 
Should our children be encouraged to live now, or should 
they be told that they are preparing to live? 
The school environment is causing our children to want 
things beyond our means. They are not satisfied 
with our manner of living. Is this attitude good for 
them? 
Our child is not interested in good grades. All she wants 
is a pass, and is not greatly concerned about that. 
What has caused this attitude? 
Our school grounds and buildings are dirty. We have 
been waiting three months for the teacher to suggest 
a “clean-up” day. Is it time for us to start some- 
thing ? 
We have a teacher who boards in a nice home, but she 
keeps her room in an untidy condition. Her desk at

school is no better. It is having a bad influence on 
our children. What can we do about it? 
We want to have singing and opening exercises in our 
school. The teacher says there is no time for them. 
What can we do about it? 
There are many little things that we want to suggest, 
but do not because we are afraid that it will be counted 
meddling. If we talk to any one about these things, 
should it be the superintendent or the teacher her- 
self? 
Our teacher has no time to teach. Her time is spent 
in “hearing lessons.”” We feel that she is employed to 
teach. We are busy with our own work and are tired 
helping our children prepare lessons for the teacher to 
“hear.” What should we do about it? 
My daughter has a cold nearly all the time. How may 
the parent and the teacher work together to cure these 
colds? What are the healthful home conditions to be 
encouraged ? 
Our teacher is causing the children to think that all 
great men and women are found somewhere besides on 
the farm. What can be done to overcome this in- 
fluence? 
Our teacher gives a great deal of time to dull children, 
letting the exceptionally bright ones take care of 
themselves. To what extent is she justified in doing 
this? 
The teacher often punishes the children by keeping 
them in at recess. How may we show her that she is 
doing wrong? 
Our teacher often sits on her desk or on the back of a 
pupil’s desk. Should she do this?

X. WHAT TEACHERS WANT TO KNOW 
Teachers who never let their problems be known 
will receive very little help in solving them. The 
superintendent or supervisor knows that the live 
teacher will ask for help. A teacher’s success can well 
be measured by the number of good questions she asks 
her superintendent or supervisor. It is possible for 
teachers to ask questions that are unimportant. Study 
the following inquiries. Select the ones which you 
consider worth studying. What is your answer to 
each inquiry? 
Sincere teachers want to know: 
. How to get pupils to be more altruistic and less selfish. 
. How to help pupils to be more courteous. 
. How to reduce tardiness. 
. When and how to teach pupils to use the dictionary and 
encyclopedia. 
. How to interest patrons in the school and secure their 
full codperation. 
6. What to do with patrons who are so interested that they 
interfere. 
7. What to do with patrons who cannot or will not help 
teach their children the lessons at home. 
8. What to do with patrons who object to their children’s 
being punished. 
9. What to do with children who have no books or equip- 
ment. 
to. What to do with the exceptionally bright or exception- 
ally dull pupils.

XI. EVIDENCES OF AN EDUCATED PERSON 
If an educated man does not differ from an unedu- 
cated man, then education does not pay. There is a 
difference and it can be seen. It is true that the 
world is not agreed on all these differences between 
the educated and the uneducated. If two men were 
to enter a strange crowd to pick out the educated men 
and women, they would likely differ on some of the 
evidences that distinguish the two groups. 
Two lists of statements are given here, one on evi- 
dences of an educated person, another on evidences of 
an uneducated person. Some of the evidences are 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  36 ACQUIRING SKILL IN TEACHING 
questionable. It may be well to define an educated 
person before trying to select the true evidences. 
After this definition is agreed upon, then select the 
evidences which distinguish the educated person. The 
same method should be used in studying the evi- 
dences of the uneducated person. 
An educated person is one who: 
Is well dressed. 
Uses correct English. 
Has a degree from a college. 
Has a friendly disposition. 
Has soft hands and well manicured finger nails. 
Gives liberally to worthy causes. 
Is kind to children and animals. 
Loves home and flowers. 
Has ability to sing and speak in public. 
Is loved by one’s own family and neighbors. 
11. Is prompt in meeting all engagements. 
12. Is polite and has good manners on all occasions. 
13. Thinks well of his neighbors; of himself. 
14. Has a good influence 
15. Has a good library. 
16. Is well informed on the issues of the day. 
17. Has a good personal appearance. 
18. Has a good bank account. 
1g. Has a well equipped house and a happy home. 
20. Has ability to adapt himself to his surroundings. 
21. Has ability to appreciate wit, and to tell funny stories.

XIII. VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 
Teaching school is no longer limited to the “three R’s.” It is as broad as life itself. The world has 
asked so often and so loud: “What can you do?” 
that it has compelled teachers and patrons to get a 
new vision of an educated person. Not ‘What do 
my pupils know?” but “What can my pupils do?” is 
the big question that should confront each teacher. 
A knowledge of textbooks is not enough to insure a 
teacher’s success. She must be broad enough and
-P-A-G-E-52

enough of a leader to guide the pupils, not only men- 
tally, but morally, socially, and vocationally. 
The following statements on vocational education 
and guidance should be studied carefully. Evaluate 
each statement. Select the ones that will best fit you 
and your school.

12. All subjects studied in the first seven grades will help one 
in his life work. 
Any subject which helps one in his life work is voca- 
tional. 
. A subject that is purely vocational for one may be 
purely cultural for another. 
. Any subject is worth while that is given for a definite 
purpose, and that guides pupils to a definite goal. 
. Vocational education should begin at home. 
. Lemech must have given his three sons vocational 
education. Jabal became a cattle man, Jubal be- 
came a musician, Tubal-Cain became a mechanic. 
. The true teacher will help all her pupils to learn what 
they are best fitted to do. 
. Each term the pupils should be taught those things which 
they would be taught if that term were to end their 
school days. 
. By the time pupils enter the high school, they should 
know what life work they will follow. 
No one is educated until he or she has a vocational edu- 
cation. 
A large majority of boys and girls who quit school do so 
because they get no vocational education. 
The home is more to blame for misfits and failures than 
the school.

  THE SCHOOL AND THE COMMUNITY 41 
Every schoolroom should be a vocational bureau and 
every teacher a vocational counselor. 
A teacher should know enough about one hundred vo- 
cations to enable her to guide boys and girls toward 
them. 
In each subject, the teacher has an opportunity to give 
each pupil some vocational guidance. 
To teach a subject independent of vocational guidance 
and vocational education is to teach in vain. 
The normal-minded pupil can succeed at whatever he 
undertakes. 
People fail, not because they are square pegs in round 
holes, but because they have had no vocational edu- 
cation. 
If schools are to serve the nation, they must stop pre- 
paring pupils for some higher school, and prepare them 
for a definite life work. 
Children, like adults, work best when impelled by a real 
life-work motive. 
There are no high vocations or low vocations. If they 
are honorable vocations, they are all on the same 
plane. 
The one who is working hard preparing for a definite 
life work deserves more credit than the one who works 
hard merely to graduate.

XIV. SCHOOL CREDIT FOR HOME WORK 
One is educated by what he does regardless of where 
his activities take place. Teachers are coming to 
realize that their work reaches beyond the school 
ground, and that they should help guide the lives of 
their pupils twenty-four hours per day and seven days 
per week. Parents and teachers are realizing that 
they have a common problem, namely, the proper 
education of the children. Without codperation, both 
parents and teachers will fail to guide the lives of the 
children. Coédperation between teacher and pupils 
and between parents and children is equally essential 
to the proper education of all the children. School 
credit for home work will encourage this complete 
codperation. 
Teachers differ in regard to what kind of home work 
should have school credit, how much credit, who 
should say when the work has been done, etc. 
Criticize the list that is given on the following 
page, both from the nature of the work and the 
amount of credit that each kind of work is given.

“This plan of giving school credit for home work will 
fail unless all of us work together. I shall send you a 
school credit card each Friday afternoon. Begin 
Sunday morning. At the end of the seventh day make 
a summary of all the points your child has earned. 
Send the card to me Monday. At the end of the 
month I shall add one per cent to the child’s grades 
for each — points given for home work.”

who earn a large number of school credits for home 
work? 
. What should be done for a room whose pupils have 
earned school credit for home work?

XVII. PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATION 
Parents and teachers are recognizing the fact that 
they have a common problem in the education of 
boys and girls, and that success can come only through 
codperation. Each must have the other’s help. 
The following statements should be discussed freely 
in the parent-teacher meeting. The program should 
take the form of round table discussions. Two or 
three statements are enough for one program. Some 
of the statements may be used as subjects for debate. 
Keep away from personalities, factions, or petty jeal- 
ousies that tend to destroy harmony. 
1. Parents should “chum” with their children, and should 
accompany them to all places where they are deter- 
mined to go for amusements. 
2. Do not make slaves of your children. The slave cannot 
grow. Personal liberties should not be denied to 
children.

A child can be given freedom to act without being given 
license to act. 
Parents and teachers should avoid the use of “don’t.” 
They spend their time and energy in telling children 
what not to do, when they should be telling them 
what to do. 
Parents or teachers have no right to say, “Quit doing 
that,” toa child until they are ready to follow it with, 
“Do this.” 
When parents or teachers say, “I'll spank you,” or, 
“Tl wear you out,” or, “T’ll skin you alive,” etc., 
they should make good their threat, or the children 
will lose confidence in them. 
Never threaten. j 
Parents and teachers should be interested in everything 
which interests the children. 
Think twice before giving a command. If you think it 
will be seriously questioned by the child, do not give it. 
Let your children feel free to ask you for a reason for all 
things that you ask them to do. 
No bad child is to blame for being bad. 
There are no bad children. Badness is only misdirected 
energy. 
People need a course in the rearing of children much 
more than a course in Latin, ancient history, or in 
the raising of hogs, chickens, and corn. 
Children are more unruly than they were in 1850. 
Children do no wrong until some one leads them to do 
wrong. 
Modern life is making it impossible for parents to spend 
enough time with their children. Formerly parents 
and children worked together ; now parents work where 
there is “no admittance.” ”

Work builds character. Children do not work enough. 
Many of them go to school until they lose their desire 
to succeed through service. 
When a child appears naughty, it may be sick or hun- 
gry. There is always a good cause for the child’s 
behavior. 
The good parent or teacher will find out why children do 
what they do, before punishment is administered, 
Most parents are sparing the rod and spoiling the child. 
A kind talk from a sympathetic parent or teacher is far 
more effective than the “rod.” 
Good parents and teachers are consistent. They ap- 
prove or disapprove the same things at all times. 
When a parent or teacher says “‘No”’ to the child, this 
answer should be final, and the child should know it. 
Answer all questions asked by children. Answer them 
truthfully. Give the child the information he seeks, 
then stop. 
Parents should give their children information about 
sex questions, before they learn it from immoral 
sources. Make the question a sacred one. 
Before working for or against any issue a good citizen 
will ask, “What effect will it have on the entire com- 
munity?” rather than, “What effect will it have on 
me?”

XIx. TOPICS TO BE DISCUSSED IN TEACHERS’ 
MEETINGS 
The value of a teachers’ meeting depends largely 
upon the program. A program should not only be 
made up of live questions, but the program committee 
should assign the questions to people who are able and 
willing to give the teachers a helpful message. Each

_XXI. COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES 
A community without activities to bring its mem- 
bers together where they can plan and work with and 
for each other, is not a growing community. One 
of the biggest things a teacher can do for a community 
is to assist in the organization of community activities. 
The people must have some common problems or there 
can be no community. In discussing these common 
problems, the interdependence of the people of the 
community is emphasized and the citizens are drawn 
closer together. 
The country is suffering for leaders who will call 
community meetings and give the people an oppor- 
tunity to codperate in solving their common problems. 
Good leaders will prepare community programs on 
topics of common interest. These programs will 
bring people together for both pleasure and profit.
-P-A-G-E-76
64 ACQUIRING SKILL IN TEACHING 
Communities grow by common effort rather than by 
individual effort. They grow by the effort of their 
own people, and not by the effort of people on the out- 
side. A person from the outside may give the people 
new ideas, but “stored up” ideas do not help commu- 
nities. 
Study the following statements on community 
activities. Evaluate each statement. Select the ones 
that you think apply to your community. 
1. Programs that are worth while in one community, are 
worth while in any community. 
2. Every community can and should have a literary society, 
a school improvement association, a community forum, 
community singings, a Y.M.C.A.,a Y.W.C.A., a 
Boy Scouts’ organization, and a Camp Fire Girls’ 
organization. 
. People want to work together. All they need is a leader. 
4. Without a leader an army would fail. A leader is as 
essential to a community as to an army. 
5. If a teacher expects to have live community meetings, 
she must carry out the following suggestions: 
. The teacher should know the patrons personally and, 
if they have confidence in her, they will gladly 
respond to her leadership. 
6. Advertise thoroughly for the meeting — in the county 
papers, through the pupils, and by means of posted 
notices. 
c. Begin planning for the meeting two or three weeks 
before the time set for the program to be rendered. 
d. Make the meeting a good one — one that will long 
be remembered by those attending. w 
g

e. Make each meeting worth while. If it is to be an 
entertainment, the program must entertain; if 
instructive, it must instruct. Make the people 
feel that they have been repaid for coming. 
f. See that the meeting begins on time and does not drag 
at any time. 
g. Have one or more local citizens placed on the pro- 
gram. 
h. Do not scold the people for not coming. If they: do 
not come to any given program, see them and say 
you missed them and invite them to come to the 
next program. 
6. Before a chairman of the meeting (or the program com- 
mittee) can have a good meeting, he must carry out 
the following suggestions : 
a. Get the proper person for each topic. Help find a 
book or an article bearing on each topic. 
6. Begin on time. Keep things moving with a snap. 
Close on time. 
c. Limit speakers who might talk too long. 
d. Throw interesting topics open for ten minutes’ dis- 
cussion. 
e. Arrange the program to meet community needs, 
7. By making a few changes to meet local problems, the 
following programs could be given to advantage in 
any community. What changes would you suggest?

1. Philippine Anthem — by the children 
2. Have a map on the board showing the public

  CHAPTER II @4' 
PRINCIPLES OF EDUCATION AND ADMINISTRATION 
I. AIMS OF AN ELEMENTARY EDUCATION 
TracueErs should have an aim for everything they 
do. They want to give only that kind of education 
which leads to a definite goal, They want also to 
know that the goal is a saan and that the work 
of each day, each month, and each year takes the pupil 
nearer the goal. ‘The good teacher consciously sets 
up a goal and guides her pupils toitf Different teachers 
may have different goals. Some goals may be good, 
some may be bad. 
The following statements on the aims and purposes 
of the elementary school have been collected from 
various sources. Examine each aim carefully and 
tell why you do or do not agree with it. Select those 
aims which a good teacher will accept as “guiding 
principles.” 
The aims of an elementary education are : 
1. To prepare pupils for high school. 
2. To prepare pupils for complete living. 
3. To give pupils a foundation on which to build, regardless 
of what they want to be.

Il. WHAT AN INTERMEDIATE GRADE GRADUATE 
SHOULD KNOW, FEEL, AND DO 
What the seventh grade graduate should know, feel, 
and do may differ for different individuals and for dif- 
ferent communities, but there are many ideas, attitudes, 
and habits that should be common to all seventh grade 
graduates. The name “common branches” signifies

a scope of work that should be common to all boys and 
girls who complete an elementary education. The 
program of studies for the elementary school is con- 
stantly changing, both by addition and subtraction. 
The following statements are made by people who 
have tried to agree on this stock of ideas, attitudes, 
and habits common to all seventh grade graduates.

think are most vital. Add others which you think 
are essential. 
All intermediate grade graduates should: 
1. Know well the common school branches. 
2. Be interested in the welfare of all humanity alike, know 
how to help all humanity, and let every thought and 
act be for the common good.

It has been said that we are a part of all that we

of study that is broad, safe, and sane. The average

teacher feels that the course of study is already pre- 
pared and that she is employed to see that her pupils 
meet its requirements. Some of the following state- 
ments of the course of study may be questioned, but 
it is hoped that they will help the teacher to see her 
part in determining the course of study, as well as 
methods for presenting it. 
In discussing the following statements it should be 
understood that a program of studies includes all that 
a school offers; a course of study includes all that is 
offered in one subject, e.g., history; and a curriculum 
includes that part of a program of studies which one 
pupil or student takes. 
Evaluate each statement. Select the ones that 
should guide the teacher. Be able to tell why each 
one is or is not a safe guide. 
1. A good course of study is composed of activities that are 
vital to the lives of the pupils. 
2. Awritten course of study isdead. It has no life activities. 
3. No useless subject matter should get into the course of 
study. Who should say what is essential and what is 
non-essential ? 
4. No lesson should be taught until teacher and pupils see a 
practical need for it. 
| 5. a. A lesson that is practical for one pupil may not be for 
another. 
| b. It may be practical for one class and not for another. 
c. It may be practical in one community and not in an- 
other.

d. It may be practical at one time and not at another. 
No teacher can succeed with a course of study that some 
one else has prepared. 
. No teacher can prepare a curriculum before she has made 
a survey of her community, any more than a physician 
can prepare medicine before the diagnosis. 
Most courses of study, like patent medicines, are pre- 
pared for all and fit none. 
A course of study can be made to fit only one community, 
for only a short time. It can be made only by one 
who knows the community. 
Courses of study are such misfits that some pupils have 
to leave school to get an education. 
The course of study is already made, and the teacher is 
helpless. 
Never have pupils study a subject merely because they 
may some day need it. They will not learn it until 
they feel a need for it. 
Most pupils are motor-minded and should spend most 
of the school day in seeing, handling, and doing. 
At some time in a pupil’s school life, he should make or 
help make every kind of article that his community 
uses. | 
The reason pupils mar furniture or destroy property is 
because they have never helped make it, therefore 
know nothing of its value. 
No one can appreciate any situation unless his experience 
enables him to do so; therefore the best course of 
study provides for the greatest variety of activities. 
The reason that some people do not respect an honest 
ditch digger is because they have never dug ditches. 
The poorest course of study provides for the fewest ac- 
tivities and the most time on “book learning.”

Children learn by doing. This fact should guide any 
one who makes a program of studies. 
Hard work is an essential factor in the making of good 
citizens. From the seventh grade on, pupils should 
have to earn a part or all of their spending money. _, 
Pupils should not study anything in which their parents 
are not interested. 
Get a good teacher; she will get a good course of study. 
A rural school should have a rural course of study, and a 
city school should have a city course of study. 
There are three hundred trades and professions. They 
should be recognized in the course of study. 
School is not a good place for home economics and man- 
ual training. These subjects can best be taught in 
the home. 
School gardens in rural schools are like brooms in city 
schools; the pupils get enough of them at home. 
The course of study should join, not overlap, home ac- 
tivities. 
The average course of study gives rural children a de- 
sire to go to the city, and city children a desire to stay 
in the city. 
A good course of study prepares pupils for something 
definite. 
Broad is the way that leads to destruction and broad is 
the course of study that leads to no definite goal. 
Truth is narrow and definite; so is a good course of 
study. 
A teacher cannot have a good course of study until pa- 
trons want it. First educate the patrons. 
As the sunflower changes to keep up with the sun, so 
will a good course of study change to keep up with 
new vocations, new activities, and new conditions.

The good teacher wants to modify, not to destroy, the 
present course of study. 
A good teacher will neither drop old subject matter nor 
admit new, without a good reason. 
No good teacher will teach a lesson, without first being 
able to answer this question: ‘‘Why teach this sub- 
ject matter to this class at this time?” 
In schools for adult illiterates, the teacher gets problems 
from the lives of the students. Why not do it with 
children ? 
A pupil graduating from a city high school will never be 
a good farmer. 
Before putting anything into the program of studies ask 
the following questions : 
a. Will it help the pupils physically? 
6. Will it help them morally ? 
c. Will it help them vocationally ? 
d. Will it help them to be better citizens? 
e. Will it help them to enjoy leisure? 
If the answer is “yes,” the subject matter should be 
admitted. 
The following ways of making a program of studies are 
good ; 
a. Get good textbooks and you have a good program of 
studies. 
6. Compile from various programs of study an average 
program for your school. 
c. Let good teachers name the minimum essentials. 
These will constitute the program of studies. 
d. Examine the most successful citizens of your com- 
munity. The things they do not know are non- 
essentials and should be left out of the program of 
studies.
-P-A-G-E-91
EDUCATION AND ADMINISTRATION 79 
e. Let experts in a subject say what should be taught. 
This subject matter will make a good program of 
studies. 
jf. Make a community survey. Find out what the peo- 
ple are doing. Make a program of studies that 
will prepare young people for these activities. 
g. Find out what parents want their children to study. 
Let this determine the program of studies. 
h. Find out what children are interested in. Let this 
interest determine the program of studies. 
4. Measure the ability of children, and make a program 
of studies that they can, with much effort, master.

IV. DAILY SCHEDULE 
A good daily schedule does not just happen. It is 
a result of much thought on the teacher’s part. A 
teacher can find plenty of daily schedules already made, 
but she will not find one made for her room. She will 
find some that are more suitable than others, but like 
patent medicines, they are prepared for all and will 
fit no individual case. 
There are some principles, however, that should 
guide any teacher who makes out a daily schedule. 
Study the following statements carefully. Evaluate 
each statement and tell why you consider it a safe or 
an unsafe guide. Also add other statements which 
would help a teacher to make a daily schedule. 
1. The daily schedule should provide study periods for 
each pupil. A study period should come just before 
each recitation. 
2. Since the primary pupils cannot study except in the reci- 
tation, they should be given more time than older pu- 
pils who can study independent of the teacher. 
3. The recitation is a place to arouse interest in a subject. 
The pupils should go from the recitation to the im- 
mediate study of the questions raised in the recitation. 
4. There is no necessity for having a fifth grade geography 
class and a sixth grade geography class. Combine 
them. The same thing is true of other subjects and 
other grades. 
5. A recitation that is not more than seven minutes long 
is of no value to pupils.
-P-A-G-E-93
  EDUCATION AND ADMINISTRATION 8x 
6. No teacher can have two classes reciting at the same 
time and be of any real assistance to either of them. 
7. From ten to eleven o’clock the pupils are mentally more 
alert than at any other hour of the day. This is the 
hour that reading and English should be scheduled. 
8. The last hour of the day the pupils are mentally least 
alert. Geography and spelling should be scheduled 
for this hour. 
9. The mind does not get its rest on “nothing to do,” but 
rather on a change of work. 
to. The average daily schedule does not provide for enough 
work and play. 
11. A daily schedule that provides for the proper amount of 
work, study, and play, will enable the pupils to be as 
mentally alert at the close of the day as at the begin- 
ning. 
With the program of studies becoming more and 
more congested, it is apparent that pupils in the one- 
room school cannot be divided into seven groups or 
grades. In most rural schools, an observer can see 
pupils at their seats, giving undivided attention to 
some topic being discussed in a recitation. There is 
no good reason why all pupils interested in a question 
should not recite together, provided the class is not 
too large. 
The program given below shows the pupils to be 
divided into three groups: grades 1, 2, and 3; grades 
4, 5, and 6; and grade 7. The teacher spends her 
time with each group every third day. The figures 
(1), (2), and (3) indicate the days on which groups have

9: 30-10 : 00, with grades 4 to 6 from 10: 00-10: 30, and

V. CONSOLIDATION 
A consolidated school is made by the union of a 
number of small schools. Many people claim that con- 
solidation is the only hope for the one- and two-room 
schools. Others say that this plan is unwise. Study 
the following statements on consolidation and evaluate 
each one. 
A. The one-room school should be abolished for the following 
reasons. 
1. The teacher has to teach so many grades, so many sub- 
jects, so many classes, and look after so many odds 
and ends that thorough work is impossible. 
2. The enrollment is small, the attendance is irregular, the 
classes are too small, and the equipment is inferior to 
the larger schools. 
The program of studies is narrow and inadequate. 
4. Special teachers of music, manual training, domestic 
science, physical culture, drawing, etc., are impossible. 
5. The teacher is usually young and “getting experience” 
by practicing on innocent children. Yet she is asked 
to be superintendent, principal, sometimes janitor, art 
teacher, science teacher, and all the special teachers 
provided in a good consolidated school. 
6. The work is so hard, the hours so long, the pay so inade- 
quate, and the sympathy and codperation of patrons 
so meager, that good teachers accept the first oppor- 
tunity to teach in large, well organized schools even at 
a less salary. 
7. The small barrio is not able to put up a good building, -

equip it well, keep it in good condition, and employ a 
good teacher for a long term. 
A small community often suffers for lack of real leaders. 
The teacher is seldom a citizen of the community, but 
often spends her week-ends in another community. 
. The population and wealth of the barrio are too small 
to furnish either pupils or wealth necessary to a good 
school. 
Individual instruction and supervised study in a one- 
room school are impossible. 
The weaknesses of the one-room school cause pupils to 
leave school too soon. 
No high school work is possible in the one-room school. 
Only two per cent of the children from one-room schools 
ever reach the high school. 
The best families are leaving the rural communities to 
find better_schools. 
B. Two or more one-room schools should unite to form one 
consolidated school for the following reasons : 
. Consolidation not only helps to hold the best people in 
the community, but attracts other desirable families. 
It increases the value of property. (Result of No. 1.) 
. It makes possible a social life, the lack of which is driv- 
ing many young people from the country. The social 
life is made more attractive by “rubbing elbows” with 
more people, through community singings, community 
forums (where vital issues are discussed), Sunday 
schools and churches, junior and senior S. I. A’s., 
literary societies, orchestras, Chautauquas, athletic 
games, etc. 
. Better community leaders are available and others can 
be more easily developed.

It gives to both children and adults a needed training in 
coéperation, in working with and for each other. It 
causes people to think in terms of a bigger community 
and about bigger problems. 
It makes it possible for athletics to be well organized and 
supervised. 
It makes for efficient gradation and classification of pu- 
pils. 
In general, it puts a better high school closer to every 
home. 
The course of study is broader, more vital, therefore more 
interesting, and because of these conditions pupils are 
glad to remain longer in school. 
Better teachers can be employed, because the work is 
more pleasant, the supervision better, and the social 
life more satisfying. 
It enables a teacher to have only one or two grades, thus 
making it possible to secure teachers who are trained 
for their special work. 
The enrollment is larger and the attendance better than 
in all the separate schools combined. 
It not only keeps children in the grades longer, but it 
causes many more to go on to the high school. 
It enables rural boys and girls to get a good high school 
education at a place and in a way that will not divorce 
them from rural life and rural people. 
It gives pupils all the advantages of a city school without 
exposing them to the glare and temptations of city 
life. 
It enables the superintendent to visit the teachers more 
often and to render them greater service. 
“Tn union there is strength.” The united districts can 
build a better building, and equip it with better books,

seats, libraries, pictures, globes, charts, laboratories, 
etc. 
18. It makes it possible to transport pupils to and from 
school, enabling them to arrive on time, dry and warm. 
Transportation also helps to solve many of the personal 
difficulties that arise on the road to and from school. 
1g. A larger taxing area is better for all concerned. 
20. The consolidated school costs no more per pupil per month 
than the one-room school.

VI. ECONOMY OF TIME IN SCHOOL 
MANAGEMENT 
The teacher who does not plan to save time will kill 
time. The plans must not stop with the daily schedule.
-P-A-G-E-102
go ACQUIRING SKILL IN TEACHING 
They must be made for a week, a month, a year, and 
in general, for several years. But possibly the most 
time is lost by not carefully planning to save time in 
each recitation. In many recitations the pupils will 
need maps, globes, charts, papers, pencils, rulers, and 
materials of many kinds. There is one best way and 
many poor ways for this material to be distributed. 
The best way can be approached only after careful 
planning. It is not likely that the teacher can have 
all this material for immediate use, but she can have 
it for immediate distribution. Teachers often kill 
time without knowing it. We are told that we are not 
fifty per cent efficient. Teachers who save time are 
in demand. Some teachers have formed habits of 
economizing time, others have formed habits of wasting 
it. The following statements have been made relative 
to the common ways of killing time. Read and eval- 
uate each statement. 
1. Teachers may not begin each recitation promptly. 
They may even be tardy. The pupils soon feel, and 
rightly so, that since the teacher is sometimes late, 
they too can be late. In a short time the pupils feel 
no personal responsibility for being prompt, and the 
recitation must wait until all are ready to begin work. 
2. It takes some teachers much longer to get classes to and 
from the recitation than it does others. The teacher 
does not save time by nagging, scolding, or threatening 
but by studying the situation, planning for economy of 
time, and by expecting the pupils to help save time. 
 
-P-A-G-E-103
  EDUCATION AND ADMINISTRATION gr 
. Some teachers are not careful to begin work promptly 
even when everything is in readiness. They may be 
finishing a little piece of work for themselves or for 
their pupils. This delay creates a wrong attitude in 
the class that takes time to overcome, * 
. Teachers often lose time by not closing the recitation 
promptly. If the teacher succeeds in carrying out 
her plans, she must have a schedule and stick pretty 
close to it. When the pupils see that the school is 
running on a fairly definite plan, they will be more 
ready to codperate with the teachers in saving time. 
. Time is often wasted in irrelevant matter. What 
teacher has not allowed some shrewd, but unprepared 
pupil (unprepared on the lesson) to lead her away 
from the subject? Before teachers can tell whether 
they are the victims of their pupils, they must see 
themselves as their pupils see them. 
. It is usually a loss of time to spend the geography period, 
the history period, etc., listening to the children read. 
Enough time is spent in a questionable way during 
the regular reading periods. 
. Some teachers have an excellent method for killing time 
by sending the classes to the blackboard. Some of 
these pupils are thinking; others are not. The period 
is often gone before any real work has been accom- 
plished. 
. Time is lost trying to explain to one a point that all the 
others know. While all learning must be individual, 
yet individual instruction is questionable, especially 
in a group where others are not interested. 
. Teachers often allow pupils to kill time by talking a great 
deal without saying anything, at least without adding 
_hew points. Time is saved by both pupils and teachers

17. something that they knew before they came to the 
class. For example, it is a waste of time to have all 
the pupils in the number class count, repeat the mul- 
tiplication table, etc. 
Time is usually lost in calling the roll. 
Teachers often kill time by compelling pupils to answer 
every question with a complete statement. What 
should be the answer to the question: When did Co- 
lumbus discover America? Under what conditions 
should a teacher demand complete sentences as an- 
swers? 
Pupils are often asked to stand every time they recite, or 
even to come forward and face the class. Under 
what conditions would such a practice be justified? 
Teachers often kill time by correcting pupils for minor 
offenses. Is it killing time to correct a pupil during 
the recitation, when the teacher’s correction causes 
more general disturbance than the pupil was making? 
Some teachers kill time by correcting each grammatical 
error made by the pupils. When should a teacher 
correct grammatical errors made by her pupils? What 
are some safe and sane methods for making these 
corrections ? 
Teachers often lose time on non-essentials. They do 
not see relative values. They do not attend to first 
things first. Most people have more than they can 
do. How can they determine the essential thing to do? 
There, is a great deal of time wasted in attempting to 
have pupils master subject matter which they will 
never need.

then,” “allright,” etc. What useless “sayings” have

19. The teacher kills time when she repeats her questions 
or the pupil’s answer. 
20. The teacher who has no well planned daily program, or 
a clear, definite plan for each recitation, is sure to kill 
time groping in the dark. 
21. The physical conditions may be such as to prohibit good 
work. The teacher who ignores such conditions is 
killing time. Mention some physical conditions that 
would prohibit good work and tell how they could be 
remedied. 
22. The teacher kills time by talking too much.

sary in school? When, how, and by whom should 
they be made? These are the questions that confront “i

every teacher. Different teachers may have different 
answers. Differences may even arise between the 
teacher and her patrons relative to rules governing the 
school. There are very few schoolroom problems 
more far-reaching, and no teacher can afford to begin 
school without giving this question careful considera- 
tion. 
Most of the following statements have been made by 
both teachers and patrons. Many of them have been 
made by pupils themselves. Evaluate each statement. 
Select those which you think are essential to the suc- 
cess of a teacher. 
Make no rule the first day except: “Do right.” 
Make no rule until the action of pupils demands it. 
Make no rules that cannot be strictly enforced. 
See that all rules are obeyed by all pupils all the time. 
Tf rules are not enforced, they are worse than no rules. 
5. Make no rules that will be opposed by the pupils or pa- 
trons. 
6. The pupils should help make all rules. 
7. Pupils should have a voice in saying when a rule has 
been violated and how the offender should be punished. 
8. All pupils who violate a rule should be punished alike. 
g. Rules should be written and posted in a public place. 
to. Rules should be printed in the school catalogue and in 
textbooks. 
11. Rules should never be written anywhere.

VIII. SCHOOLROOM DISCIPLINE 
No teacher can expect to succeed until she is able to 
govern her school. The first thing that patrons ex- 
pect of their teacher is to “‘keep order,” and the second 
thing they expect of her is to teach. If she can’t do 
the first, she can’t do the second. Probably more 
teachers fail on account of poor discipline than from any 
other one cause. { Good order is obtained, not by beg- 
ging or commanding, but by the mental attitude and ay

the general behavior of the teacher. The eye is more 
powerful than the rod, provided the teacher’s steady 
eye reflects a sympathetic soul. The good teacher 
knows that temper begets temper, that noise begets 
noise, and that order begets order. She knows that the 
teacher who would control her pupils must first con- 
trol herself. There are some teachers, however, who 
enter the schoolroom to control the pupils, without 
thinking of themselves. They say by word or action: 
“Tf you want to see who is boss, just start something.” 
Pupils are willing to help keep order, but when the 
teacher relieves them of this responsibility and assumes 
control of the room, she usually has plenty to do 
The following statements have been made on School- 
room discipline. Some of them are questionable. 
Examine and evaluate each statement. From these 
statements, select the principles that, if put into prac- 
tice, would make nearly every teacher a better dis- 
ciplinarian. 
1. When the pupils are so still that you can hear a pin fall, 
the room is well disciplined. 
2. A well disciplined room, like a bee hive, is a place where 
there is some humming. 
. So long as a pupil does not disturb others, he is orderly. 
. The teacher is to blame for the greater part of all bad order. 
. Any one who disturbs others, is disorderly. 
. A teacher is often disorderly. Nagging, scolding, worry- 
ing, getting excited, snapping the fingers, etc., on her 
part create disorder.

. Poor teaching always results in bad order. 
. Good teaching insures good order. 
. The best disciplinarians give the least attention to “keep-

. The teacher’s lack of preparation for the day’s work.” 
The teacher’s failure to hold herself on a higher plane

IX. SCHOOL PUNISHMENT 
“When I began teaching I punished my pupils a 
great deal more than I do now. I have learned to get 
along more peaceably.” This is a statement that one 
often hears made by experienced teachers. There are 
some teachers and patrons who still feel that to spare 
the rod is to spoil the child. 
The true teacher has one purpose for doing what she 
does, namely, to help the child become a better citizen. 
She has set up a goal for each child, and uses various 
means to direct the child to this goal. Whatever 
form of punishment she uses, she reasons that the end, 
or the goal, justifies the means. 
The teacher may need to help set up the goal, but 
if the pupils do not see the goal as their own, the 
teacher will have to spend a great deal of energy try- 
ing to force them toit. The good teacher will do more 
than set up a goal. (1) She will spend more energy 
in getting her pupils to want to reach the goal than 
she spends in driving them to it. (2) She will give 
the pupils all the responsibility that they will take, 
and increase it as fast as the pupils can take it. 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
  100 ACQUIRING SKILL IN TEACHING 
(3) She will help the pupils to keep the goal far 
enough ahead to stimulate the maximum of effort. If 
the goal is too far away the pupils will become discour- 
aged ; if it is too close, it will fail to challenge the best 
that is in the pupils. 
Since teachers cannot always control the thoughts 
of their pupils, they resort to various kinds of punish- 
ment to control their actions. The following state- 
ments on punishment should be studied carefully. 
Read and evaluate each statement. Select the state- 
ments that contain principles which you will try to 
practice. 
1. Punishment, in some form, is necessary in all schools. 
2. No two pupils should receive the same quantity or qual- 
ity of punishment though they may seem to have com- 
mitted the same offense. : 
. A pupil should never be punished publicly. 
4. There is a better way of reaching any pupil than through 
corporal punishment. 
5. Corporal punishment is a confession of the teacher’s 
weakness. 
6. A teacher should never punish a pupil when either the 
pupil or the teacher is angry. 
7. Never punish one pupil for the good of others. 
8. Punishment which does not make a pupil ashamed of his 
conduct has a bad effect. 
g. Natural punishment is better than artificial punish- 
ment. 
to. Pupils should realize that teachers suffer more pain in 
giving punishment than the pupils do in receiving it. wo

No pupil should be punished until he first sees that he 
deserves it. . 
The pupils themselves should sometimes help the 
teacher decide what kind of punishment their class- 
mate needs. 
The offense is often caused by the teacher’s neglect. 
When this is the case, no punishment should be given. 
No principal or superintendent should punish a teacher’s 
pupil for her. 
_Pupils should never be punished for their first offense. 
The switch has harmed more pupils than it has helped. 
Order, secured by whipping, is better than no order at all. 
Order, secured through fear, is bad order. 
There are some pupils who boast of getting a whipping 
every day. Such a pupil has been harmed by the 
switch. 
A good teacher seldom sends a pupil to the principal’s 
office. 
Never say, “Do this because your parents think it is 
right,” or “Do this because your teacher thinks it is 
right.” 
Teachers should seldom, or never, call on parents to help 
control a child. 
The pupil may be sent home with instructions not to re- 
turn until one or both of his parents return with him. 
No_true teacher will use sarcasm. 
A pupil who creates a continual disturbance should be 
made to work and play alone. 
A good teacher punishes with kind words or a sympa- 
thetic look. 
The most effective punishment is given by pupils them- 
selves when they show that they are disappointed in 
the behavior of their classmate.

Making pupils show the school what they were doing. 
Depriving one of necessary privileges.

ment. 
Making pupils do anything which hurts their pride.

EXERCISES 
1. a. During school hours a teacher noticed a pupil who was 
committing a small offense. She said aloud, “John, 
I want to see you at recess.” 
b, Another teacher noticed a similar offense but said noth- 
ing. As the pupils passed out for recess, the teacher 
asked John to remain in for a minute. She did it so 
quietly that it was hardly noticed. 
Question: Which teacher showed the better judgment? 
Why? 
2. a. It was time for recess. Some pupils had been a little 
disorderly. The teacher had their names. She 
read them aloud and asked them to remain in. The 
others were excused. 
b. It was time for recess. Some pupils had been a little 
disorderly. The teacher said: “I feel sure that you 
boys and girls know right from wrong. Those of 
you who think that you have done right this morning 
may pass out for recess.” 
Question: Which teacher showed more tact? Why? 
What should the teacher say to the pupils who stayed 
in? What should she do to the guilty ones who did 
not stay in? 
Vx. EDUCATION THROUGH PLAY 
“All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,” is 
an educational thought that is as old as Jack. The 
game idea has always been an important factor in the
-P-A-G-E-116
104 ACQUIRING SKILL IN TEACHING 
education of children. The foot race, spelling match, 
ciphering match, and school contests in general have 
great educational values because they encourage the 
play element. Teachers, parents, and leaders in 
general are recognizing, as never before, the impor- 
tance of appealing to the play instinct in the education 
of boys and girls. Many communities employ one or 
more playground teachers. The aim of such leaders 
is to educate the boys and girls through play. The 
teacher who is not emphasizing the play spirit in her 
daily program is not abreast with modern educational 
thought and practice. 
Any good thing can be over-emphasized. It is 
possible to over-emphasize the play idea in education. 
In the following list of statements the reader may find 
some false ideas as to the educational value of play. 
Study each statement carefully and tell why you think 
it is or is not sound. Select those statements which 
contain ideas that would be good in your school. 
1. All work should be made play and all play should be 
made work. 
2. All that pupils do can be classified as play, work, or 
drudgery. 
3. There is no educative value in drudgery. 
4. The teacher or playground supervisor should be on the 
playground. 
5. A playground supervisor who does not know children’s 
games, and who cannot be a child, is worse than no 
supervisor.

. Any teacher can learn to be a playground supervisor. 
. More real citizenship is taught on the playground than 
in the schoolroom. The playground is a place where 
pupils develop character. 
. The average recess is only half long enough. 
. Robbers and liars are those who have not been taught to 
play fair. 
Children learn more during the first six years of their 
lives than they do during the next twelve years, be- 
cause they play so much during the first six years. 
No game is good unless it leads to something better. 
Parents cannot educate their children at home. Edu- 
cation is obtained through play, through association, 
through giving and taking. 
Life is team work, which must be learned through play. 
There should be one-half hectare of playground for every 
fifty pupils. 
One grade should be on the playground every period of 
the day. 
Teachers can learn more about child nature in ten min- 
utes of play than in ten hours of classroom study. 
Play is as good for the mind as for the muscle. 
An athlete is not usually a good student. 
Play teaches pupils to observe the golden rule. 
A playground supervisor is more useful than an algebra 
or Latin teacher. 
A good playground supervisor would soon have all the 
people of the community enjoying plays and games. 
It is wicked to keep a pupil in at recess. 
A good playground is one that is well equipped. 
Any school can make most of the equipment that is 
necessary for a good playground. 
No meanness is ever done except by idlers.

26. A properly supervised playground is a great blessing to a 
community. 
27. A good playground supervisor is more essential than a 
good playground. 
28. Crime increases as opportunities for play decrease. 
29. Teachers should take their pupils on a picnic hike each 
week. 
30. On the playground one learns obedience, respect for the 
rights of others, honesty, codperation, unselfishness, 
patience, self-control, and his dependence on others. 
31. Without play, order in the schoolroom is impossible. 
32. Pupils should be allowed to be on the playground early 
and late. 
33. Boys and girls should have separate playgrounds. 
34. The playground is America’s melting pot. Without it, 
Americanization would be impossible. 
35. Playgrounds are not so essential in the country as in the 
city. 
36. Some games develop individuality, some develop team 
work; but one is as essential as the other.

XI. STUDENT ACTIVITIES 
Before studying the following statements, the 
students or teachers should decide upon a meaning for 
the term “student activities.” So far as the state- 
ments given below are concerned, the author has had 
in mind those group activities which take place out- 
side the regular classroom work, such as athletics, 
literary societies, school orchestras, club work, enter- 
tainments, and different kinds of special programs. 
These activities are becoming more and more a regular 
part of the school work. It is possible for a teacher to 
give student activities undue emphasis. It is also 
possible for a teacher to neglect student activities to 
such an extent that success for her is impossible. But 
no true teacher will take a stand for or against student 
activities until she has carefully studied their real aim 
and value. 
Study the following statements, and in the light of 
your reading and past experiences, tell why each 
statement is or is not true. 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
108 ACQUIRING SKILL IN TEACHING 
Student activities are to be tolerated, not encouraged.

Pupils should take part in the social events of community 
life. 
Self-control, codperation, leadership, initiative, respon- 
sibility, etc., are secured through student activities. 
One gets more real benefit from student activities than 
from the study of textbooks. 
Anything that the students do whole-heartedly is a stu- 
dent activity. 
Student activities are more important in the upper grades 
and in the high school than in lower grades or in col- 
lege. 
The teacher should supervise all student activities. 
No student activity should be begun without the teach- 
er’s approval. 
Without student activities, school life is drudgery. 
Each school should be divided into two equal groups. 
These groups should compete mentally and physically. 
Inter-school contests are bad because : 
a. They create hate, envy, jealousy. 
6. They take pupils away from home. 
c. They keep pupils up late at night. 
d. They are too exciting. 
e. They cause precocity. 
Pupils would be better off if they remained quietly at 
home more than they do. 
If the teams must make trips, they should be well chap- 
eroned. 
Intra-group contests are as interesting as, and more 
wholesome than, inter-group contests.

Strenuous games, such as football for boys and basket 
ball for girls, are to be discouraged. : 
Music, both vocal and instrumental, has far too small a 
place in school life. 
The board of education makes a better investment when 
it employs a music teacher or a playground supervi- 
sor than when it employs a Latin teacher. 
Each school should compose, edit, and print a school 
paper. 
A school paper would add life to each common school 
branch. 
Dancing should be prohibited because : 
a. It is overstimulating. 
6. The habitual dancer is bored by ordinary socials. 
c. Some pupils are not permitted to dance. 
Some schools have too many student activities. 
The teacher must encourage some pupils and discourage 
others as to time spent in student activities. 
Student activities keep pupils on the “go” so much that 
home ties are broken. 
Student activities take so much time that pupils not 
only make low grades in their regular work, but they 
often lose too much sleep. 
The home, not the school, should be the community 
center. 
Only Friday and Saturday nights should be open to 
school activities. 
No activity is harmful or helpful in itself. It is what it 
leads to that determines its value.

XII. EXAMINATIONS 
There are different types of examinations, but 
every teacher has some method of examining her pu- 
pils. It is necessary that pupils be tested. Without 
examinations of some kind, promotions would be 
given on mere guess work. The modern tendency is 
toward letting short tests and daily grades have more 
weight in determining the pupil’s final grade. It is 
argued, however, that this modern tendency is 
causing our pupils to become less studious and more 
careless. 
No true teacher wishes to follow custom unless it is 
evident that the customary way is the right way. The 
formal examination is a custom that is being put in 
the balances. The teachers are studying the ‘causes 
and effects” of examinations. Children would like to 
dodge examinations. Adults who enjoy them are
-P-A-G-E-123
scarce ; EDUCATION AND ADMINISTRATION III 
but if examinations are necessary evils, we 
must make the most of them. 
Evaluate the following statements which are made 
on examinations. Select the statements which you 
think should guide the teacher who wants to do the 
best thing for her pupils. 
1. Examinations should be given each year of the child’s 
school life. 
2. The more advanced the pupil, the more difficult the ex- 
aminations should be. 
3. Examinations should count one-third, daily grades one- 
third, and the teacher’s common sense judgment of 
the child one-third. 
4. Examinations are good and should be given because: 
a. 
b. They train the pupils for examinations which will 
come all along through life. 
They cause a general review, thereby giving a. new 
view, and a unity to the entire course. 
They furnish an incentive to study, fix an aim, and 
prevent “scattering.” 
. They train pupils to pick out important points and 
neglect the non-essentials. 
They show the teacher her own weakness as a teacher. 
They give mental training. 
They train in self-control, ease, concentration, and 
conciseness of expression. 
. They help the teacher to show the parents that pupils 
are or are not prepared for promotion. 
They enable the superintendent to unify the work in 
all his schools.

. They cause pupils and teachers to think of examina- 
tions rather than social efficiency. 
They cause pupils to neglect daily work and trust 
to “cramming,” to pass examinations. 
They test memory, not efficiency. 
They furnish false ideas of what is important.’ 
They tempt pupils to be dishonest. 
They excite pupils, make them nervous, and lower 
their general health. 
They are usually unfair. 
No two teachers grade alike. 
They put unnecessary work on the teacher. 
Every recitation should be a test. 
Frequent tests should be given. 
Announce tests in time for pupils to prepare for them. 
Give no catch questions in examinations. 
An excellent daily record should excuse one from final 
a.

Z examination because : 
It would create a habit of daily study. 
It would help punctuality, deportment, etc. 
Daily grades are more effective and more nearly fair. 
To excuse some pupils from final examination creates 
talk, envy, jealousy, factions, etc., and should not be 
done. 
Examination questions should not be made by the 
teacher, nor should she grade the papers of her pupils. 
The city or county superintendent should make all ex- 
amination questions. 
The state examiner should make all questions for pupils 
taking the examination for elementary school diplomas. 
There should be some optional question on any written 
examination. 
Pupils should help make the questions.
-P-A-G-E-125
EDUCATION AND ADMINISTRATION 113 
17. A teacher should never give an examination without 
handing back all papers plainly corrected. 
18. No grades should be put on papers that are handed back. 
1g. The busy teacher is justified in giving papers a hasty 
glance and throwing them into the waste basket. 
20. Elementary pupils should not be made to worry over a 
“pass.” 
21. School work would be more effective if teachers would say 
less about grades, ‘‘ passes,”’ ‘‘ flunks,” etc. 
22. Pupils should be taught to grade each others’ papers. 
23. The time spent grading papers could usually be more 
profitably spent at something else. 
24. As a rule, pupils pay very little attention to corrected 
papers. 
25. Pupils should be asked to recopy all corrected papers and 
hand both papers again to the teacher. 
26. The next lesson after the examination should be spent 
on the examination questions, giving equal emphasis 
to all questions.

XIII. MEASURING RESULTS OF CLASSROOM WORK 
The value of examinations, as we have seen, is being 
questioned. They are being displaced by various 
forms of mental measurements. When a _ teacher 
grades an examination paper, she hardly knows how 
much faith to put in her own judgment. Starch and 
Elliott! had a student solve a problem in geometry. 
The solution was given to forty-nine geometry 
teachers. They were asked to examine the paper and 
grade it on the scale of o to 123. Mathematics being 
an exact science, one would expect all to give at least 
approximately the same grade, but their grades were 
as follows : 
9 gaveito 6 gave it 6 
in “ “cc 2 2 “cc “ 64 
2 “cc “ 3 4 “ “c 7 
a, “& 
f “ “ a 4 “ “ : 
to # && Bie eres 
2 “ “ 5st T “ce “ce 12k 
These results might well cause a teacher to doubt 
her ability to give a fair mark to an examination paper. 
Such investigations have shown the necessity of stand- 
ard tests. 
The actual value of tests and measurements to the 
classroom teacher is still a question to be decided.

Some argue that they are being over-emphasized, and 
that a few years will see them follow in the way of 
“other fads.”” Others are opposed to this view and 
believe that tests are only in their infancy. 
Study the following statements on tests and measure- 
ments. Evaluate each one. Select those statements 
which you consider sound both in theory and in practice. 
1. Everything that exists has quantity and can be measured. 
2. Nothing can be accurately measured without a definite 
scientific unit of measurement. 
3. The formal examination does not enable one to measure 
classroom results because : 
a. No two people will give the same value to an exam- 
ination paper. 
6. No one person will give the same value to a paper to- 
day that he gave to it yesterday. 
c. The examination may be too easy, too difficult, too 
long, or too short. 
4. The pupil that makes the best grade is usually the one 
that guesses best at what is in the teacher’s mind. 
5. No one knows whether he has succeeded or failed until 
the results of his efforts have been measured. 
6. A teacher can measure a pupil’s ability as accurately as 
she can measure his height. 
7. Pupils differ as much in mental strength as in physical 
strength. The mental difference is as easily measured 
as the physical difference. 
8. One’s ability to jump can be measured only as it is com- 
pared with the distance that others jump. 
g. One’s ability in arithmetic can be measured only as it is 
compared with what others can do in arithmetic.

How much should a twelve-year-old child weigh? How 
tall should he be? How fast should he run? How 
far and high should he jump? These questions can- 
not be answered until the average weight, height, and 
ability are obtained for twelve-year-old children. 
How much should a twelve-year-old pupil know in the 
common school branches? This cannot be answered 
until thousands of twelve-year-old pupils are examined 
— thus enabling one to obtain an average or stand- 
ard. 
A teacher has no way of determining whether a pupil is 
weak, strong, or medium, except as the pupil’s ability 
is compared with the average or standard. 
Education is nothing more than the change which takes 
place in an individual. In the past, teachers have 
guessed at the amount of this change. To-day, 
through the aid of standard tests, the amount of this 
change can be accurately measured. 
The business of the teacher is to change pupils. The 
changes most worked for by good teachers and most 
needed for the betterment of mankind are changes of 
character, of ideals, of daily living, of mental attitude, 
of social life, etc. Such changes cannot be measured 
by standard tests. 
No person, in any business, commercial or educational, 
can tell whether he is succeeding or failing until he 
measures the results of his effort and compares it 
with what is being done by others in his field of 
work. 
Teachers and pupils will not do excellent work until they 
are stimulated by facts brought out by standard tests 
and measurements. 
Comparisons are not worth while unless results are ob-

tained by similar methods and compared with similar 
standards. 
18. A standard grade or ability is obtained by giving a test 
to a large number of pupils and getting the average. 
The greater the number of pupils, the more accurate 
the standard. 
19. The work which is necessary to secure an accurate stand- 
ard.is more than the classroom teacher has time to do. 
20. Standard tests are already worked out for all the common 
school branches. Good teachers use them to measure 
the ability of their pupils. Any teacher can give these 
standard tests. 
21. Standard tests should take the place of formal examina- 
tions. 
22. Tests and measurements are of more value to the super- 
visor than to the classroom teacher.

THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 
I. FACTORS THAT DETERMINE METHODS IN 
TEACHING 
A FARMER will not handle two mules by the same 
method. A child will not handle two pets by the same 
method. A mother will not use the same method with 
two children. The nature of the mules, pets, and 
children will determine the methods used. 
The same is true in regard to the methods used by 
teachers. As children differ, methods must differ. 
No two children are alike. Even if they were, their 
different environments would soon make them different. 
Children come to school differing in temperament, in 
knowledge, in ambition, in habits, in mental attitudes, 
in prejudices, etc. All this must help determine the 
methods used by the teacher. 
The school building, its location, lighting, ventila- 
tion, and heating systems, the amount and kind of 
equipment, etc., will help determine methods. The 
good teacher will do the best she can with what 
she has.

   THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 121 
The community, its customs and ideals must not 
be ignored. Methods, however good, will fail unless 
the community can be made to see their value. 
The teacher herself is an important factor. No two 
teachers can use the same method in the same way. 
There are many minor factors in any environment 
that help to determine method. 
The following statements regarding factors that de- 
termine method in education have been made by 
teachers and patrons. Some of them are questionable. 
Read and evaluate each statement. Select the ones 
which you consider most important. 
1. Method and content in education are determined by the 
age and disposition of pupils. 
2. Method and content are determined by the aim of educa- 
tion. The methods used in Eskimo schools are dif- 
ferent from ours because their aim of education differs 
from ours. 
3. Method and content do and should differ for different 
communities. In communities where the homes and 
churches do less, the schools must do more. 
4. The good teacher is the one who makes use of the child’s 
likes and dislikes. The poor teacher is the one who 
ignores them. 
5. The reason that pupils want to quit school is because 
the course of study ignores their likes and dislikes. 
6. When a teacher has trouble with a pupil, it is because . 
she is interfering with his native tendencies. 
. The good teacher will encourage some instincts, discour- 
age others, and some she will let alone.

19. ACQUIRING SKILL IN TEACHING 
The child learns more during its first six years than dur- 
ing the next twelve years, because during the first six 
years it is free to follow its instincts to imitate, con- 
struct, play, etc. 
No teacher can say what she will teach or what methods 
she will use until she meets and studies her pupils. 
Play has an educative value. School work, for pupils 
in the elementary school, should not be far removed 
from play. 
The more freedom a pupil has, the more he will follow 
his native tendencies, the longer he will stay in school, 
and the faster he will develop. 
Children instinctively like to construct, and a good 
teacher will arrange each child’s schedule accord- 
ingly. 
All elementary school pupils should do some construc- 
tion work daily, both at home and at school. 
The teacher who leads the leader, leads the school, be- 
cause pupils instinctively follow the leader. 
The instinct of rivalry causes one to want to keep ahead 
of his classmates. The teacher should use methods 
that will encourage this instinct. 
The teacher should use methods that will guide rivalry, 
because rivalry, unguided, will run into envy and 
jealousy. 
The child’s mind instinctively jumps rapidly from one 
thought to another. The adult’s mind has been 
trained to stay in one channel. Method and content 
should not ignore this difference. 
Children instinctively want to own something. Par- 
ents and teachers who ignore this tendency will fail 
to inspire children to do their best. 
All children arrive at the “collecting period.” This

collecting tendency never leaves a person — and should 
not. A good teacher helps the child to collect ideas. 
Curiosity is an instinct that comes early. It never 
leaves a person — and should not. Method and con- 
tent should be such as to encourage a pupil’s curiosity. 
Children instinctively like to be guided. They instinc- 
tively dislike to be driven. Good teachers respect 
these likes and dislikes. 
Children instinctively wonder at God’s handiwork. 
Such reflection is good for character building and 
should be encouraged. 
Each person is instinctively fitted to do a certain kind of 
work. The teacher should help pupils find the work 
they are best fitted to do. This can be done through 
the proper method and content. 
Before a teacher can know the proper method and con- 
tent, she must ask and answer the following questions 
about each of her pupils: 
a. What are the natural tendencies and abilities of this 
pupil? 
6. What training has this child had? 
c. What habits, physical, mental, or social, has this 
pupil formed? 
d. Howcan I best help this child to overcome his bad hab- 
its, and how can I help him to form good habits? 
e. What goal should I set up for this pupil this term? 
j. How, with this child and his environment, can the 
the goal be reached?

~ Il. INDUCTIVE TEACHING 
Ideas do not travel. They develop in the minds of 
individuals. Teachers cannot give their own ideas 
away. They may say something or act in a way that ° 
will cause their pupils to have certain trains of thought 
but the pupil’s idea may be entirely different from the 
teacher’s idea. Different pupils will get different ideas 
from the teacher’s instruction. The ideas which 
one gets from an experience depend on his previous 
experiences. Teachers sometimes try to teach a child 
without knowing what the child knows. Teaching 
under such conditions is mere guess work. The good 
teacher studies the child’s mind. She sees the prob- 
lem as the child sees it. She puts herself in the pupil’s 
place and attacks the problem with him. 
Study the following statements to see which ones 
you think are safe and sane for the classroom teacher. 
Be able to tell why you think each statement is or is 
not safe and sane. 
1. Inductive teaching is helping the child, by means of 
examples, to make his own definitions, rules, princi- 
ples, or conclusions.

  THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING I25 
Before a teacher can help a child get an idea, she must 
first know what ideas the child already has. 
The following examples would enable a pupil to make a 
good definition of an adjective: The round cocoanut, 
the large cocoanut, the green cocoanut, the ripe cocoa- 
nut, six cocoanuts. 
Rules, definitions, and principles are sicastieek and 
useless to pupils till they have helped make them. 
. Never say, “Work this by the rule,” unless it is the 
pupil’s rule. 
When a pupil discovers that fis rule is better stated by 
the text, then, and not until then, he should be allowed 
to memorize the rule. 
The child can understand nothing that is foreign to his 
experience. 
The child can learn nothing without going through the 
steps of preparation, presentation, comparison, and 
generalization. 
"The step of preparation means the teacher’s preparation 
of the subject matter. 
It is as important to prepare a child’s mind for studying 
the lesson as it is to prepare the ground for the seed. 
Books encourage memory; the world demands thinking. 
The inductive lesson leads through experience to a concept. 
No child has a clear concept of anything, because his 
experiences are too limited. 
Most adults have false concepts of most things. 
One is not fully justified in saying that all crows are 
black, until he has seen all crows. One cannot truth- 
fully say that all wood burns until he has burnt all 
wood. 
One cannot accurately define a dog until he has seen all 
kinds of dogs.
-P-A-G-E-138
126 ACQUIRING SKILL IN TEACHING 
17. One can never see all dogs, all rivers, all crows, etc., 
therefore, he will never have a true concept of them. 
18. 3?+4?=5%. This one example enables the pupil to 
make the following rule: Of three consecutive num- 
bers, the square of the first, plus the square of the sec- 
ond is equal to the square of the third. 
19. (23)?=6%; (33)?=12}. These two examples are enough 
to enable the pupil to say that the square of a whole 
number and a half is got by multiplying the whole 
number by one greater than itself and adding one- 
fourth. 
20. Teaching by types is a short and safe method of induc- 
tive teaching. 
21. One gets a better notion of a city by learning all about 
Manila, than by learning a little about one hundred 
cities. 
22. The idea expressed in No. 21 is also true in getting a no- 
tion of a river, mountain, tree, dog, chair, man, house, 
and farm. 
23. The child learns faster out of school, because there he is 
permitted to learn inductively. 
24. All that one knows for certain was learned inductively.

Tell how each concept developed. 
2. Name a concept that has changed during the past year. 
3. How must a child learn the following general truths? 
(a) Fire burns; (6) Apples are good to eat; (c) A 
verb agrees with its subject in number; (d) An island 
is a body of land surrounded by water. 
III. DEDUCTIVE TEACHING 
Inductive thinking takes one from particular cases 
to the general; deductive thinking takes one from the 
general to the particular ses There are lessons in 
which inductive thinking’ should predominate, other 
lessons in which deductive thinking should predom- 
inate, but it is not often that either induction or de- 
duction is used alone. 
If one apple costs five cents, what will ten apples 
cost? Before a child can solve this problem he must 
apply a certain rule. This is deductive reasoning. 
The best way to learn a rule is inductively, but 
teachers often make the mistake of saying, “Here is 
the rule, commit it to memory.” A burnt child dreads 
fire not because it has committed any rule to memory,

because it learned inductively that fire burns. 
application of this rule or principle is deduction. 
Study carefully the following statements. Be able 
to tell why each statement is or is not true. 
I. 
To. 
It. 
12. 
13 Deductive teaching and inductive teaching are found 
together in all lessons. 
Deductive teaching is going from the general to the 
particular — ‘‘ Working the problem by the rule.” 
Testing a generalization, trying it out, seeing if it works, 
etc., are examples of deduction. 
In telling why this or that is true, one does deductive 
thinking. 
We spend so much time in memorizing what others have 
learned, that we learn very little ourselves. 
There are four steps in deductive thinking: 1. A problem. 
2. A search for the rule or the reason. 3. Inference 
which is followed by anact. 4. Verification, to prove 
the inference. 
No rule, principle, or truth is understood until it is 
learned inductively. 1 
Deduction enables one to understand rules. 
Induction is a method of educating; deduction is a 
method of instructing. 
Induction makes one independent; deduction makes 
one dependent. : 
Induction is an unnatural way of learning; deduction 
is the natural way. 
Inductive method is getting truths first hand; the de- 
ductive method is getting the truth, rule, or principle 
second hand. 
. All rules, definitions, and truths were first learned in- 
ductively.
-P-A-G-E-141
  THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 129 
14. To getarule or truth inductively enables one to remem- 
; ber it longer than to get it deductively. 
15. One can get a rule or truth much more quickly deduc- 
tively. 
16. The deductive method is usually safer and saner. 
17. The little child learns most of what it knows inductively. 
18, The inductive method is a method of finding out; the 
deductive method is one of explanation. 
1g. In answering the question: ‘Which is heavier, a quart 
of milk or a quart of cream?” one must think inductively. 
20. A greater part of school work is, and should be, deduc- 
tive.

IV. THE PROPER USE OF TEXTBOOKS 
Many pupils have been advised to “see what 
the book says,” until they have become dependent on 
the text. They have acquired the habit of believing 
all that is printed. Many teachers have taught the 
text and nothing but the text, until they are not in

touch with the busy, practical world. It is not the 
purpose of this study to show that teachers and pupils 
do not need textbooks. It is hoped, however, that a 
discussion of the following statements will enable the 
teacher to see the proper relation which the textbooks 
bear to the process of education. These statements 
have been made by both teachers and supervisors. 
The pupils themselves have made some of them. 
Study each statement and tell why you think it is or 
is not true. 
1. Textbooks may be useful, or they may be harmful. 
2. Interest should be aroused in a subject before the pupil 
sees the text. 
3. Textbooks should not be used except to help pupils solve 
living questions in which they are vitally interested. 
4. The textbook work is the least part of school life. 
5. Most subjects could be better taught without a text. 
6. Textbooks are good to draw the attention of teachers 
and pupils away from the main issues of life. 
7. Textbooks cannot be made to fit any one county, com- 
munity, or class. 
8. The teacher who sticks to the text is a hindrance to her 
community. 
g. A teacher who does not know the text is a hindrance to 
her community. 
to. Teachers and pupils should help make the textbooks. 
11. It is a mistake to have pupils tell what the text said. 
12. The pupil should study live “things” rather than dead 
“texts.” 
13. Dead texts are driving many pupils from school. 
14. Textbooks are making teachers and pupils dependent. 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 131 
15. The average text is never needed again, after examina- 
tion. 
16. Pupils should be taught to take what the book says 
“with a grain of salt.” 
17. No good teacher will ask pupils to close their textbooks 
while she keeps hers open. we 
18. Most courses could be made more interesting and hel, 
ful if the pupils had different kinds of textbooks. 
1g. Adults read only when they want information. Chil- 
dren should enjoy the same freedom. 
20. No good teacher will ask the questions that are found in 
a textbook. 
21. No good teacher will depend on only one textbook. 
22. Modern textbooks are one of the greatest factors for the 
improvement of instruction. 
V. TEACHING PUPILS HOW TO STUDY 
If teachers spent, as much time in teaching pupils 
how to study as they: spend in telling them to study, 
many of our school problems would be solved. A 
teacher’s big work, however, is not so much to teach 
pupils how to study as it is how to study geography ; 
how to study history; how to study arithmetic, etc. 
No good teacher will do a child’s thinking for him, nor 
will she leave him to struggle alone. The teacher 
should get a lesson from the mother eagle that teaches 
her little one to fly by pushing it off the high cliff. 
The little one is permitted to struggle but the mother 
remains near. When the little eagle begins to fall, 
the mother darts under it and gives it help by letting it

  132 ACQUIRING SKILL IN TEACHING 
ride long enough to be carried to a higher and safer po- 
sition. This the mother repeats — helping just enough 
and no more — until her “pupil” learns to fly. A 
well meaning teacher often helps her pupils before they 
o: tried to help themselves. Such aid is question- 
le. The child that looked at the pipped egg and 
“helped” the chicken by removing the shell did the 
chicken an injury. When a child asks for help, the 
true teacher will neither give it nor reject it without 
first asking herself this question: ‘How will my act 
affect the life of this pupil?” 
Graduates may have ever so much knowledge, but 
unless they know how to study they are not good 
teachers. Teachers are trying to find out the best 
methods for teaching pupils how to study. Much has 
been written and said on this question. Examine 
each of the following statements carefully, and tell 
why you do or do not think it is good. 
1. There is one best method for writing on a typewriter. 
When left alone, one will acquire a slow, clumsy 
method. The same is true with the method of study. 
Teachers should help pupils find the best method. 
2. One’s method of study determines his rapidity in learn- 
ing and his progress in life. 
3. In teaching pupils to study, a greater responsibility 
rests on the elementary teacher than on any high 
school or college teacher. 
4. A problem is half solved when the pupil can state it 
clearly.

If the pupils do not study, the teacher is to blame. 
If a tenth grade pupil has not a good method of study, 
he or she never will have one. 
Pupils can’t study unless they want to, and they can’t 
want to unless they are interested. 
Pupils can’t be interested in any problems except their 
own. 
Pupils should be taught to estimate or guess at the re- 
sults. ' 
Pupils should be encouraged to question what the text, 
their classmates, and their teachers say. 
Pupils are made dependent by being encouraged to 
“Jean” on texts, teachers, and parents. 
Pupils read and listen so much that they have no time 
to reflect. 
Studying (reflecting, thinking) educates. Nothing else 
does. 
Drill or memory work, map drawing, habit formation, 
etc., require no studying. 
Life out of school furnishes more occasions for real study 
than life in school. 
Studying with books is not so good as studying with 
materials and people. ‘ 
No one pupil can get a good method of study for all sub- 
jects. 
Meaningless subject matter and dogmatic teachers are 
causing pupils to form anti-study habits. 
There are more demands for good thinking on the farm ~ 
than in the study of Latin. 
To know what one’s life work is to be, is essential to real 
study. 
The teacher who does not respect all questions asked by 
pupils, is not helping pupils to study.

Pupils that ask no questions are not studying. 
The teacher’s business is not to teach subjects, but to 
teach pupils how to study subjects. 
When a teacher merely says, “Take the next lesson,” or 
“the next chapter,” or “the next four pages,” the 
pupils will do poor work in preparing such a lesson. 
One period may well be spent in teaching pupils how to 
study the next lesson.

13. Have an aim for studying each lesson. See the goal and 
work toward it. 
. Each pupil must do his own studying, or he will become 
dependent. 
Study in a quiet place, but do not allow little things to 
disturb you. 
Be systematic. Havea definite time to study each of 
your school subjects. 
If you cannot concentrate on a subject, let it alone. 
Know thyself, in order to select the time, place, and way 
for effective study. 
Know what you want to do before you start. 
Donotstudyatrandom. Haveadefinite problem to solve. 
Have everything ready before you sit down to study. 
Get busy at once. 
Read the lesson once. Read it again and pick out the 
main points. 
Close the text and see if you have retained the main 
points. 
Talk to some one about your lesson. 
Eat, sleep, play, rest, and work at the right time and in 
the right way.

VI. PLANNING THE LESSON 
During the recitation the teacher is expected to 
make every minute count. She is expected to do a 
great deal in a short time. This means that each les- 
son should be well planned. The shorter the recita- 
tion, the more careful and definite should be the lesson 
plan. There are different kinds of lesson plans, but 
the busy teacher should make the kind that will best 
answer her individual needs. ' A good lesson plan which 
a teacher may prepare for herself might have very 
little meaning to another teacher. A good teacher has 
an aim for each recitation, and plans the lesson so 
as to accomplish her aim. The téacher who has no 
aim except to “‘hear the lesson” does not see the need 
for a lesson plan. It requires less energy to let things 
drift. 
The following statements on lesson plans have been 
collected from various sources. Evaluate each state- 
ment. Select those statements that a good teacher 
will try to put into practice. 
1., No lesson is planned until the teacher: 
a. Has a definite aim for teaching the lesson. 
6. Knows why the pupils study the lesson. 
c. Becomes familiar with the subject matter. 
d. Organizes it psychologically.

. No good teacher will go before her class without a definite

. The teacher who does not plan each lesson, drifts and

. The teacher who has not studied and planned the lesson

to-day,” “Pass to the board,” etc. 
. If the teacher has no aim, the class will have no aim. 
. Without a plan ‘a teacher does not know why, how, or 
what to do. 
. The teacher should have a definite daily plan, a definite 
weekly plan, and a general plan for each month and 
term. 
; To have any one of these plans (in 7) without the other is 
useless.

for the carpenter.

No teacher can use another person’s plans. 
No teacher can succeed this year with her last year’s 
plans. 
A teacher who has taught one subject for twenty years 
does not need to make her lesson plans. x 
A lesson plan is for particular subject matter, for par- 
ticular children, and for a particular time. The three 
are all the time changing. 
No lesson plan should be destroyed, but kept for refer- 
ence. 
A teacher can no more make a lesson plan without know- 
ing her pupils, than a cook can prepare a meal without 
knowing the people who are to eat it. 
Lesson plans must vary to suit: (1) the teacher, (2) the 
pupils (age, maturity, number in class, etc.), (3) the 
community, (4) the season, (5) the aim of the recita- 
tion, (6) the subject matter, (7) length of the recitation. 
Teachers should have a written plan on the desk. 
The good teacher will carry out her plan to the letter. 
The plan should call for the exact number of minutes to 
be given to each part of the recitation. 
Teachers who fail, do so because they do not plan their 
lessons. 
A good lesson plan is more in the mind than on paper. 
It takes more time to make long lesson plans than they 
are worth. Experienced teachers do not make them. 
The subject matter and method should not be divided 
into separate columns. ’ 
A good lesson plan can be put on one side of a postal.

VII. ASSIGNING THE NEXT LESSON 
Some teachers do not assign lessons. They merely 
tell the pupils what the lesson is without telling them 
what to do or how to do it, and without helping them 
to realize a vital purpose for doing the work. In a 
spelling class the teacher said, “Take the next twelve 
words.” The pupils did not know whether they were 
to spell the words, define them, use them in sentences, 
mark them diacritically, or whether the teacher ex- 
pected them to do something else with the words. 
The pupil who guesses best at what the teacher wants 
is too often the one who makes the best grade. 
The farmer who told the hired hand to go to work 
in the south field, without telling him what to do or 
how to do it, was as definite and as inspiring as the 
teacher who says, “Take the next lesson.” Noone 
would ask a boy to drive an automobile without first 
showing him how to do it, yet this is the kind of task 
some pupils are expected to do. The assignment is to 
teach the pupils what to study and how to study. 
A good lesson assignment not only causes pupils to 
think but it makes them hungry for more knowledge. x,

Three teachers assigned the same lesson — Causes of 
the Revolutionary War — to the same grade of chil- 
dren. The first said, ‘‘Take the next lesson.” The 
second said, ‘‘Take the next lesson. Study it hard.” 
The third said, “We are ready to study the causes of 
the Revolutionary War — a war in which some of our 
forefathers fought. When did this revolution take 
place? Where? In any war there are two or more 
interested parties. Who were they in this Revolution- 
ary War? Did you have any ancestors in this war? 
Why is one of the parties to this war called the ‘mother 
country’? Might the thirteen colonies be called the 
children? How far apart did the mother country and 
the thirteen children live? Point toward England. 
How far is it from here? Point toward the thirteen 
colonies. Why did the Pilgrims leave England? 
These relatives, separated by the Atlantic Ocean, 
three thousand miles wide, have fallen out. We are 
to study the causes of this family row. You may 
think England was to blame; you may think the col- 
onies were to blame; or you may say that a third 
party had something to do with this fuss. To-morrow, 
when we try to settle these questions, be able to give 
reasons for your opinions. On pages — your author 
tells you what he thinks about it. Some other authors 
may tell you a different story. Refer to any books 
that you may have, but here are some library books 
that will help you” (naming books and pages). y

     The following statements have been made on lesson 
assignments. Look them over carefully. Evaluate 
each statement and tell why you do or do not agree 
with it. Pick out the ones which you are willing to 
try to put into practice. 
# It requires five minutes, or more, to make a good assign- 
ment. 
2. Often a whole period should be spent in assigning a lesson. 
3. The teacher who says, “Take the next lesson,” “Next 
six pages,”’ “Next chapter,” etc., is a poor teacher. 
. No teacher can assign a lesson well until she knows her 
pupils well. 
. No teacher can assign a lesson until she knows it well. 
. Never assign a lesson until you know how it will affect 
_ the conduct of your pupils. 
. Never assign a lesson until you can give a good answer 
to this question: ‘Why assign this lesson to this class 
at this time?” 
- No lesson is well assigned until pupils are interested in 
it and feel a vital need for studying it. 
. No lesson is well assigned until the pupils have been 
taught how to study it. 
. Let the pupils help select the quantity and quality of the 
next lesson. 
. Lessons may be assigned at the beginning, in the middle, 
or at the close of a recitation. One place is as good as 
another. 
. The assignment should be written on the board and the 
pupils should copy it. 
. When pupils come to class saying, ‘‘I did not know where 
the lesson was,” the teacher is to blame.

. Never make an assignment until all are listening. 
. Always have pupils recite on what you assigned, and 
hold them responsible for the assignment. 
Assign nothing more than all the class can get. 
An assignment that is good for one sixth grade pupil may 
be poor for another. 
An assignment must appeal to the pupil’s experience, 
his home life, therefore assignments must be made to 
individuals, not to the entire class. 
No lesson can be properly assigned until the teacher 
finds out what the pupils already know about the sub- 
ject. 
In a good assignment the teacher and the pupils will ask 
questions. 
Of the five formal steps of the recitation, the assignment 
may well be called the first step — preparation; study- 
ing the lesson may be called the second step — pres- 
entation. 
Before a teacher assigns a lesson she should know: 
a. What effect it will have on her pupils. 
6. That all the pupils are able to solve the problems or 
understand the subject matter. 
c. That all the pupils have time, health, and opportunity 
to prepare it. 
d. The entire course of study and how this one lesson is 
connected with the entire course of study. 
e. The amount of real study required to prepare the 
lesson, not merely the number of pages.

VII. THE RECITATION 
When a superintendent is looking for a teacher, he 
wants to know how she conducts a recitation. She 
may be ever so strong along other lines, but if she is a 
failure in the recitation, she is a failure as a teacher. 
There are a great many ways to conduct recitations. 
There is more than one good way. A majority of 
teachers conduct recitations about the way their teach- 
ers did, but each teacher should respect her own indi- 
viduality. A teacher may have a fairly good method 
of conducting recitations without being able to tell 
where she got the method or why she uses it.
-P-A-G-E-156
  144 ACQUIRING SKILL IN TEACHING 
It is said that knowledge commands respect, but 
the ‘‘walking encyclopedia” who sees no relations be- 
tween facts, and whose ability lies in “reciting” is not 
necessarily a progressive citizen. The good teacher 
no longer demands of her pupils the bare ability to 
recite what the book says. She wants them to see 
living issues and to reason from cause to effect. 
Some of the following statements are questionable. 
They should be carefully studied and evaluated. 
Pick out the ones that you consider to be safe and 
sane. Give reasons for your opinions. 
1. A good teacher will never begin a recitation until she can 
answer this question: ‘Why should this subject 
matter be taught to this class at this time?” 
2. No two recitations should have the same aim. 
3. In each recitation, there should be several aims. 
4. A teacher should have the following aims in all of her 
recitations : 
To test the pupils’ knowledge. 
To discover and clear up difficult points. 
To train pupils to reason. 
To teach pupils how to study. 
To furnish opportunity for pupils to express their 
thoughts. 
To encourage a friendly debating spirit. 
To stimulate and direct the social side of pupils. 
To help pupils see relative values. 
To awaken inquiry and arouse curiosity. 
To form good habits of attention, thinking, expression, 
and acting. es &eeR

To train pupils in morals and manners. 
To develop the true spirit of codperation. 
To teach new facts. 
To entertain the pupils. 
. To drill in work that should be made habitual. e388 
y Clases should be called and dismissed by signals, such 
as the tapping of a bell, counting, etc. 
. Some teachers have pupils seated in a straight row, 
some in a semicircle, some in a double row, some let 
them remain at their seats, but one method of seating 
pupils during a recitation is as good as another. 
. If pupils remain seated at their desks for the recitation, 
they should remove all useless material from the tops 
of their desks. 
. The good teacher will not only discover any inattention 
but she will quickly check it. 
. One can always judge a good teacher by the amount of 
talking she does during the recitation. 
Children think rapidly, but a good teacher will always 
keep in the lead. 
A teacher is always reflected in the facial expressions of 
her pupils. Some teachers see themselves, others do not. 
When a teacher sees a cold, indifferent, and uninterested 
class of pupils it is herself that she sees reflected in her 
pupils. 
Give equal attention to all pupils in the class. 
Give equal emphasis to all points in the lesson. 
A recitation is not a place to settle questions, but a place 
to raise them. It is not a time to recite, but a time 
to study. 
Pupils should recite and then study on the problems 
raised during the recitation, rather than study and 
then recite on what they have studied.

. A good teacher is not dogmatic during the recitation 
but encourages the pupils to think for themselves and 
to draw their own conclusions. 
The pupil who gets the best grade is not the one who 
thinks, or takes issue with the teacher, but the one who 
can guess best at what the teacher has in mind. 
Illustrate one or more points on the blackboard during 
each recitation. 
Pupils should feel free at all times to ask the teachers 
the following question: “What reasons have you for 
wanting us to do this?” 
A good teacher will encourage all her pupils to ask ques- 
tions at any time. She will never embarrass a pupil 
because he asks a simple question. 
When interest lags, the recitation should be dismissed. 
When interest in the recitation lags, it means that 
either the teacher or the subject matter should be 
changed. 
A good teacher will often take the wrong side of a ques- 
tion long enough to stimulate pupils to think.

IX. THE SOCIALIZED RECITATION 
The socialized recitation is not a new idea. It is as 
old as the recitation. All teachers socialize their reci- 
tations — more or less. Some teachers can socialize 
the recitation in one subject better than they can in 
another. If pupils enjoy going to the geography reci- 
tation more than to the history recitation, perhaps it is 
because the geography recitation is more socialized. 
There is a great effort made by good teachers to social- 
ize every recitation. The time is past when teachers 
think the most good comes from studying the subject 
which is most despised. 
Evaluate the following statements on the socialized 
recitation. Be able to tell why you do or do not think 
the statements are sound in theory and in practice. 
Select those which you consider most vital to the teacher. 
1. A socialized recitation is one in which the pupils are 
working together to solve some vital problem. 
2. In a socialized recitation, the teacher guides, but does 
not dictate. The pupils feel free to express their 
opinions.

12. Io. ACQUIRING SKILL IN TEACHING 
In the individualistic recitation, the teacher does most 
of the talking; in the socialized recitation the pupils 
do most of the talking. 
. The more a teacher talks in a recitation the less help 
she is to her pupils. Her big work is to get the pupils 
to think and to express their thoughts. 
The question-and-answer recitation crushes individual 
activity and development; the socialized recitation 
encourages them. 
The socialized recitation will not permit of mere reciting 
what some one else has said. The pupils are inter- 
ested. The stimulus comes from within. 
In a socialized recitation there is free conversation 
among the pupils. This conversation often takes the 
form of discussion, debates, criticisms, etc. 
The socialized recitation affords a pupil greater opportu- 
nities for initiative, self-control, and moral development. 
The socialized recitation encourages rambling, poor 
thinking, and lack of thoroughness. It brings about 
long discussions but no conclusions. 
The socialized recitation enables pupils to get an excel- 
lent give-and-take attitude which every true citizen 
must have. 
In a socialized recitation pupils learn to act rather than 
listen. They become leaders as well as followers. 
Their interest is active rather than passive. They 
learn to codperate and to work with and for each other. 
The recitation should occasionally be turned over to the 
pupils. They should select a leader. The teacher 
should be one of them. 
In a socialized recitation the teacher gradually makes 7 
/ her pupils independent, thereby making her services 
more and more necessary.

21. THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 149 
The socialized recitation trains pupils to watch them- 
selves, rather than to be watched. 
The freedom that is given to pupils in a socialized reci- 
tation fails to help the\weak pupils. The more a pu- 
pil needs activity along any line, the less likely he is 
to seek it; the less a pupil needs activity along any 
line, the more likely he is to seek it. The good pupils 
become better and the poor pupils become poorer. 
The socialized recitation enables the bright pupil to 
monopolize the time. 
A socialized recitation may be formal or informal, it 
may be organized or unorganized, it may be in the 
nature of some club, league, convention, etc., but in- 
terest and democracy must always be present. 
Some say that the pupil’s greatest need is initiative, 
others say it is self-control. Neither can be neglected. 
Both are cared for in the socialized recitation. 
Since the pupils do most of the talking in a socialized 
recitation, it is easier on the teacher than the individ- 
ualistic recitation. 
The pupils could do most of the talking and still the 
recitation might not be socialized. The teacher could 
do most of the talking and the recitation might still 
be socialized. 
The socialized recitation trains pupils to think and speak 
in public, to be polite, and to assume responsibilities, 
. Some teachers can succeed with the socialized recitation, 
others will fail. 
. No teacher can socialize all of her recitations. 
. No teacher should socialize all of her recitations. 
. Life itself is one large socialized recitation. 
The socialized recitation is more than a preparation for 
life; it is life itself.

27. The socialized recitation is better than the usual recita- 
tion, because : 
a. It enables pupils to have their own purposes for study. 
6. It encourages initiative and codperation instead of 
passivity and competition. 
c. It helps the pupil to be independent instead of de- 
pendent. 
d, It encourages thinking instead of memory. 
It encourages pupils to seek principles instead of an- 
swers. 
It encourages more reading and more outside work. 
It draws on the experiences of the pupils and encour- 
ages them to do their part of the talking. 
It encourages the pupils to ask questions. 
It encourages constructive criticism. 
It encourages good English, oral and written. 
It interests pupils and reduces disciplinary problems 
to the minimum. osc as °

X. THE PROJECT METHOD 
The project method, like the socialized recitation, 
is a new name for an old idea. Parents and teachers 
used the project method before there were any public 
schools. The many things that children under six 
years old do and make, represent projects. Children 
make mud pies, playhouses, kites, stilts, etc., because 
they want to. When the teacher takes advantage of 
child nature and ties her work up with the interests of 
the pupils, she is using the project method. There 
are some teachers who say the project method repre- 
sents “soft pedagogy” and that children should have 
to study certain lessons and do certain things whether 
they enjoy it or not. 
True teachers mean to do the best thing for the pu- 
pils. Most of the following statements on the project 
method have been made by earnest teachers. Eval- 
uate each statement. Select the statements that you 
are willing to put into practice. Why? 
1. A project is any purposeful act that one does whole- 
heartedly. The act may continue for a few minutes 
or a few years, but there is always interest because 
one is going toward a goal of his own choosing. 
2. Most school work is done on tasks assigned by the 
teacher, and cannot be called projects. 
3. Children work harder on their own problems than on 
problems assigned by the teacher.

22, ACQUIRING SKILL IN TEACHING 
The curricula, so far as possible, should be made up of 
the child’s own vital problems. 
All that any one does is for his own satisfaction. 
If one is not interested, he cannot do good work. 
The greater the interest, the greater the effort. 
A project for one member of the class is a project for all. 
The following are projects: Making a kite; building a 
boat; caring for a cow; baking a cake; solving a prob- 
lem in arithmetic; making a dress; painting a pic- 
ture; listening to a story; conjugating a verb. 
One’s life activities should be projects, never tasks. 
Pupils should select their own projects. 
Pupils should be guided in selecting all their projects. 
Teachers can select safer, saner, and better projects for 
pupils than the pupils can select for themselves. 
The tactful teacher will select pupils’ projects for them, 
and let them feel that they have done the selecting. 
If pupils are not interested in a lesson, do not assign it 
to them. 
All school work can and should be made interesting. 
Some work cannot be left to childish whims. Pupils 
must be made to take it whether they like it or not. 
No pupil should be excused from any elementary 
subject. 
Pupils should have two hours per day in which they can 
do whatever they please. 
Children learn more the first six years of their life than 
the second six, because in the first six they are allowed 
to choose their own projects. 
Adults do only those things which interest them; chil- 
dren should have the same privilege. 
Activities that we enjoy prepare us for life much more 
than activities that we do not enjoy.
-P-A-G-E-165
  THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 153 
23. One’s project depends upon the age of the pupil, sex, ex- 
perience, and home life. 
24. A project for one may be a task for another. 
25. Activities that a pupil enters into whole-heartedly make 
him better morally, while tasks give him habits of 
hating, dawdling, deceiving, etc. These habits will 
injure him morally, socially, and physically. 
26. If one cannot be interested in a subject, let him drop it 
or it will injure him. 
27. The spirit of play should pervade all school work. 
28. The greatest need in the public schools to-day is teachers 
who can select the essentials and make them inter- 
esting. 
29. No teacher can have pupils interested in school work un- 
til she is interested in both the pupils and the work. 
30. A disinterested teacher is a handicap to her pupils and 
to the community. 
31. If one is not interested in a subject, it is because he knows 
nothing about it.

XI. THE PROBLEM METHOD 
One cannot study the project method independent 
of the problem method. A project is made up of a 
number of problems. Good teachers are trying more 
and more to see that their pupils work only on pupil 
problems. They are studying their children as well as 
their texts. They are teaching children instead of 
books. No teacher can succeed until she knows the 
likes and dislikes of her pupils. She must know the 
child’s problems before she can make a good assignment. 
To say, ‘Take the next lesson,” is usually to ignore 
the child’s problems. 
Study the following statements on the problem 
method. Be able to tell why you agree or disagree 
with each statement. Select those statements which 
contain sound pedagogical principles. 
1. Problem 24 on page 49, is too often task 24 on page 49. 
2. A task is not one’s own problem. It has been given by 
one in authority. : 
3. A pupil works well only on his own problem, but it is nec- 
essary that all pupils work on problems other than 
their own. 
4. School work is made up mainly of tasks assigned by the 
teacher. 
5. A pupil often spends more energy in trying to escape 
work than it would take to do the work. Such effort 
is a hindrance to moral growth. 
6. Pupils get tired of solving assigned tasks. They leave 
school to work on their own problems.

19. THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 155 
A child’s world should be enlarged. It has many big 
problems which it could never see or feel without the 
help of a teacher. 
A pupil never thinks or studies just because he is asked to. 
. Memory, without thinking, is useless. 
Without childish problems, a child would never learn to 
think. 
Every lesson should contain a living problem for each 
pupil. 
No lesson should be formally assigned. Find out what 
pupils are already thinking about, and help them to 
think better on their problem. 
All worth-while subject matter can be given in the form 
of living problems. 
Primary pupils will work well on assigned tasks, older 
pupils will not. 
Nothing is a problem for a pupil until he wants to solve 
it because he sees how it will help him reach his goal. 
The pupil does just enough to get by, because the 
teacher sets the goal and assigns the task. 
Every pupil that quits school before the age of eighteen 
represents one or more teachers who have not given 
enough time to the child’s own problem. 
Nothing is learned well until it is learned in connection 
with solving one’s own problems. 
Teachers should skip all lessons that cannot be made liv- 
ing problems for the pupils. 
(See references on Section X, Chapter III.)

XII. METHODS OF QUESTIONING 
The success of a teacher depends as much upon her 
skill in asking questions as upon any other single fac- 
tor. | The teacher may be a great scholar, a good dis- 
ciplinarian, and an excellent organizer, but if she is not 
skilled in asking questions) she is a poor teacher. 
Asking questions is like playing chess, in that to be 
successful one must look ahead. The teacher should 
not only ask definite questions, but should have a good 
reason for eath question, knowing that it will help 
accomplish the aim of the recitation. 
The test question has its place, but it has been over- 
worked. In the main, the teacher should ask ques- 
-tions to lead her pupils to see the subject in a bigger 
way. It would be interesting to know the teacher’s 
reason for asking the following questions: 
“Henry, have you finished your problem?” 
“Yes, ma’am.” 
“Ts your answer 62?” 
“Yes, ma’am.” 
“You reduced 43 to an improper fraction, did you?” 
“Yes, ma’am.” 
“That gave you $, did it not?” 
“Yes, ma’am.”
-P-A-G-E-169
  THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 157 
“Then you multiplied $ by 3, did you?” 
“Yes, ma’am.” 
“The product is 22, is it not?” 
“Yes, ma’am.” 
“You multiplied that by 2, did you?” 
“Yes, ma’am.” 
“That gave you 63, did it not?” 
“Yes, ma’am.” 
“How many got that?” 
There are still a few teachers who’ think this “yes, 
ma’am” method of questioning is permissible. But 
a great number of teachers are studying the art of 
questioning. They realize that good questions result 
in good thinking. | The following statements have been 
made largely by “teachers in service. Some of these 
statements may be questionable. Evaluate each state- 
ment and tell why you think it is or is not true. Select 
the statements that you are willing to put into prac- 
tice. 
1. Ask only one question at a time. * 
2. Ask only thought questions. —

they can all understand you. y

them written in logical order.

22. ACQUIRING SKILL IN TEACHING 
Ten good questions are enough to ask during one recita- 
tion. 
A question should never suggest or include the answer. 
A teacher should not, by a nod or shake of the head 
indicate to a pupil whether the answer is right or 
wrong. 
The teacher should ask each pupil one or more questions 
at each recitation. 
A question that is good for one member of the class is 
good for the others. 
. No one pupil should be asked mere questions than an y 
other. 
After one pupil has been asked a question, he should 
be given no more until all others in the class have been 
called upon to recite. 
. It is a bad plan to begin at the head of the class and aa 
questions to the pupils in a regular order. 
It is the business of the teacher to do all the questioning. 
Ask the question, then call on a pupil to answer it. This 
will cause every pupil to think the answer for every 
question. 
When visitors are present, ask questions of those pupils 
only who can answer the questions, or ask the dull 
pupils easy questions. 
In each recitation, the teacher should ask some test ques- 
tions. 
Every question should be asked to an individual stu- 
dent, and never to the class as a whole. 
Never ask the questions found in the textbook. 
The text has questions that are as-good as, if not better 
than, any questions which the teacher can make. 
Therefore, use the author’s question. 
Tell why each question given below is or is not good:

XIII. THINGS A GOOD TEACHER WILL DO IN 
EVERY RECITATION 
A teacher can well do one thing in one recitation 
that might be questionable in another. One teacher 
may be able to do some things in a recitation that an- 
other teacher should not attempt to do. There are, 
however, a number of ideas that are common to all 
recitations. The following statements on what a good 
teacher will do in each recitation should be studied 
and evaluated. Let each teacher select the state- 
ments that she will try to put into practice. Each 
teacher should be able to tell why she selected certain 
statements and rejected others.
-P-A-G-E-173
THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 161 
In each recitation a good teacher will : 
1. Begin the recitation by reviewing the last lesson. 
Hold the attention of all the pupils all the time. 
Get all the pupils to recite. 
Get pupils to recite ideas rather than words. 
Keep “hands off” and give pupils a chance to think. 
See that classmates do not interrupt the one reciting. 
See that only one pupil talks at a time. 
Correct each mistake in English as soon as it is made. 
Inspire all the pupils to do their best, both in and out of 
school. 
Make an assignment that will inspire each pupil to 
study. 
11. Use the experience of the pupils to add interest to the 
lesson. 
12. Help the morals and manners of each pupil. 
13. Permit a good, hearty, free-for-all laugh. 
14. See that pupils are at ease, and feel free to talk, even if 
their opinions differ from hers. 
15. See the subject matter as the pupils see it. 
16. Spend half the time sitting and half the time standing. 
17. See that pupils stand when reciting, so that they will 
talk to the point, get through more quickly, and hold 
the attention of the class. 
18. Be patient, whatever happens. 
1g. Get pupils to control themselves. 
zo. See that pupils do not whisper, cheat, chew gum, mark 
on desk, throw pencil shavings or paper on floor. 
az. See that each pupil enjoys the recitation. 
22. Get pupils to discover and correct their own mistakes. 
23. Find out why each unprepared pupil was unprepared. 
24. Embarrass each unprepared pupil, by talking to him or 
her in the presence of the other pupils. SOs 0Qits OF On Py mies 4

Stick to the assigned lesson, permitting nothing to make 
her wander. 
See that the pupils get one new idea which they will re- 
tain. 
Give credit for reasoning rather than memorizing. 
See that each pupil does some real thinking. 
Praise some of the pupils. Reprove some. 
Make the work practical. 
Teach pupils to work in groups without discord. 
Summarize the lesson, so as to help pupils retain the big 
ideas. 
Assign the next lesson in a way that will not only enable 
the pupils to know what to do, and how to do it, but 
in a way that will make them want to study it. 
EXERCISES 
Was the teacher asking too much of his pupils when he 
said, “‘We shall spend the last five minutes of the reci- 
tation in writing a summary. You may write what I 
have told you during the last forty minutes.” 
. At the close of the day ask the pupils to write the new ideas 
they have learned that day. 
(See references on Section VIII, Chapter III.) 
XIV. “DON’TS,” OR THINGS A GOOD TEACHER 
WILL NEVER DO 
“Don’t” has been over-emphasized. Many parents 
and teachers have spent so much time in telling chil- 
dren what not to do that they have had very little 
time to tell them what to do. The destructive critic 
can use don’t, but it takes a constructive critic to use 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
   THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 163 
do. In spite of all our talk against the use of “don’t,” 
the author has been encouraged to write a list of 
“don’ts.” Most of them are safe. Some of them are 
questionable. The teachers should study each “don’t” 
and decide for themselves whether the advice is good 
or bad. In the main, these “don’ts” are confined to 
the recitation. 
A teacher should not : 
1. Begin the recitation until all the pupils are comfortably 
seated. 
2. Be slow in beginning the recitation. 
3. Have the pupils scattered or seated in a straight row. 
4. Have a regular order for calling on pupils to recite. 
5. Do more talking than the pupils do. 
6. Do the pupils’ thinking for them. 
7. Do anything for pupils which they can do for themselves. 
8. Help pupils solve problems until they have tried and 
failed, nor settle any question before the pupils have 
had time to think about it. 
g. Ask the pupils to do anything until she knows they can, 
will, and should do it. 
to. Ask pupils to commit to memory that which she does 
not know. 
11. Fail to use the blackboards. 
12. Be cold, dignified, or emotionless. 
13. Pose as one who knows it all. 
14. Scare her pupils by grading each recitation. 
15. Stick to the textbook. 
16. Ask parents to teach their children at home in order 
that she may hear them recite at school. 
. Scold pupils for not knowing their lessons.

XV. THE SCHOOL LIBRARY 
Some school libraries are good, some are poor. 
Some school libraries are good for some of the pupils 
and poor for others. The good teacher will not only 
get a library, but she will get one that is good for all 
the pupils. Boys and girls will never become good 
readers without more than textbooks to read. The 
pupils may be made hungry for knowledge, but unless 
there is a library where they may go and encourage 
this hunger, it cannot last long. 
Study the following statements and tell why you do

and magazines for adults, not for children. 
Books, papers, and magazines are more important than 
single desks. 
There should be five times as many books in the library 
as there are pupils. 
Each room should add twenty pesos’ worth of reading 
material to its library annually. 
A good library can be acquired by getting patrons to 
give a book each year. 
No patron will give a choice book to the library. Money 
should be donated by patrons. Then good books may 
be purchased. 
No one person is capable of selecting the library books. 
The books should be selected by the superintendent, the 
supervisor, the teacher, the pupils, and the patrons. 
Many books and magazines are so dangerous that they 
should be quarantined. 
The Philippine or provincial government, the university 
or normal school, the superintendent or teacher will 
help any community select a good library. 
Select only those books that pupils like. 
A library that does not attract pupils to it is worse than 
no library.

XVI. APPRECIATION 
One whose sense of appreciation has not been trained 
has no chance to get real enjoyment out of life. Teach- 
ers do not purposely neglect this important factor in  
-P-A-G-E-180
  168 ACQUIRING SKILL IN TEACHING 
education, but they are watched by patrons more 
carefully along the line of “book learning.” This has 
a tendency to cause teachers to neglect the feeling side 
of education. The time will come when patrons will 
be as interested to know the ability of their children 
to enjoy the beauty in nature or the beauty in art as 
they are now to know how they are progressing in 
their books. If rural children could only be taught to 
see the beauty in trees, flowers, birds, clouds, corn 
fields, landscapes, etc., country life would be far more 
attractive, and there would be fewer people moving to 
the cities. If city children could only be taught to 
see the beauty in character, in nature, in clean streets, 
back alleys, lawns, signboards, and buildings, the city 
would be a better place in which to rear a family. 
Study the following statements on appreciation. 
Evaluate each one. Be able to tell why you think 
each statement does or does not contain a vital truth. 
1. To teach children to appreciate a beautiful sunset is as 
important as to teach them to spell. 
2. Children will no more learn to appreciate the beautiful 
without a teacher than they will learn mathematics. 
3. Ifa teacher does not teach her pupils to appreciate art, 
music, and nature, she does not earn her salary. 
4. Feeling, sympathy, emotion, and appreciation are syn- 
onymous. 
5. One who can look on a touching scene, listen to or read a 
touching story, without shedding tears is not so de- 
sirable a citizen as the one who weeps.

. No true citizen can see a dirty street or lawn, or a 
poorly kept farm, without having a feeling of shame. 
Pupils will neither love the good nor hate the evil unless 
they are taught to do so. 
When left alone, pupils learn to appreciate the low, 
questionable things rather than the good. 
One can be so skilled in music or painting that he fails 
to appreciate anything in these fields except the pieces 
which are free from all errors. 
Before we can sympathize with one who is suffering, we 
must have suffered ourselves. 
Since we want our children to be in sympathy with all 
mankind, we should give them the experiences of all 
mankind. 
Some people have not had enough experience to be good 
neighbors. 
Textbook education will never cause people to be sym- 
pathetic and unselfish. Pupils should have more 
work with and for other people. 
The more ideas people have in common, the more they 
appreciate each other. 
The common school is to give all people a common body 
of information. 
The lack of common ideas is the cause of divorces, riots, 
factions, and wars. Two people cannot enjoy each 
other’s company unless they have some ideas in common. 
The teacher’s greatest work is to teach pupils to appre- 
ciate “small favors.” 
Children must be taught to appreciate parents, home, 
and friends. 
Appreciation, once learned, will not be lost. 
The best way of teaching appreciation is to deprive one 
of the thing you would have him appreciate.

SCHOOL HYGIENE 
I, A STANDARD ONE-TEACHER SCHOOL BUILDING 
Tr is not right for money to be spent on a poor school 
building when the same amount would put up a good 
building. It is the business of the teacher to know the 
elements of a good school building. Her advice is 
usually sought. Many times her lack of knowledge 
is embarrassing. Her information is often meager 
and indefinite. The builders then proceed, in a blind 
way, to put up a home for the teacher and her children. 
Teachers may not agree on minor elements of a good 
school building, but they can agree on the essentials. 
Below is given a suggested standard for a one-teacher 
building. Much of this can be found in different state 
standards. Select the parts which you think are good. 
Select the parts that would be good for any school 
building.

The schoolroom is an unhealthful place; this condition 
cannot be entirely remedied. 
Teachers should know both the symptoms and the reme- 
dies for the common diseases. 
. Every teacher should room alone. 
Io. 
Ih. Every teacher should eat three light meals daily. 
Every teacher should board at least one mile from the 
school building. 
For a teacher to burn midnight oil shows poor judgment. 
A teacher is not justified in sitting up to grade papers. 
It would be better to throw them into the waste bas- 
ket. 
A good teacher will have a well-balanced schedule of 
work, play, exercise, and rest, and will carry it out 
daily. 
A teacher should set aside a monthly allowance for inno- 
cent amusements. 
To keep physically fit, a teacher should daily have some 
time alone, and some time with people of other pro- 
fessions. 
People laugh and grow fat. Most teachers are too dig- 
nified. 
Teachers should be interested in things that interest the 
patrons. Thinking and talking school all the time is 
injurious to one’s health. 
Each teacher should have a hobby outside of school that 
will give the mind a rest. 
The tired teacher does not need a rest from work so much 
as she needs a change of work in a new environment. 
The teacher who is not physically fit cannot inspire boys 
and girls to be physically fit. 
A good teacher will be on the school ground two hours 
daily, playing with the pupils.

Ill. THE PUPIL’S DAILY HEALTH CHORES 
Whether boys and girls grow to be strong men and 
women depends largely on the habits they form while 
young. Teachers can render no greater service to 
children than to help them acquire worth-while daily 
habits. If keeping up with the pupil’s daily health 
chores does not help the pupil to form better habits, 
the plan is a failure. 
Pupils can begin Monday night and make a mark 
after each chore that has been done that day. There 
are different methods for keeping the records, but the 
main purpose is to help the child to be able to “make his 
mark” daily, until good habits are formed. 
Parents will and should keep up with what the chil- 
ren are doing, but the pupil is the one to say whether 
he deserves a mark.

IV. HEALTH WORK IN THE SCHOOL 
What is the teacher’s duty in regard to the child’s 
physical development? This is the big question that 
both teachers and patrons are asking. The teacher 
who thinks her work is limited to training the minds 
of children, has a small vision of her profession. “May 
I spend this day improving the bodies as well as the 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
  178 ACQUIRING SKILL IN TEACHING 
minds of my children” is a good daily prayer for the 
teacher. 
A properly planned daily schedule has a place for 
physical education, but the good teacher will see to 
it that the health of the children is cared for during 
the entire day’s program. A visitor should be able to 
look at the daily program and see that the child’s health 
has been kept in mind. 
Study the following statements on the health work 
of the school. Some of them are questionable. Eval- 
uate each one. Select those statements which contain 
principles that are sound both in theory and practice. 
Be able to tell why you select one and reject another. 
1. No one is educated until the mind, spirit, and body are 
well developed. 
2. Teachers think too much of mental education and too 
little of physical education. 
. Any one who will pay the price can have health. 
. Some had rather die than live temperately. 
. No one knowingly injures his health. 
. Each generation is responsible for the physical fitness of 
the next generation. 
7. A good teacher will have her pupils undergo a physical 
examination annually. 
8. A good teacher has a medicine cabinet in her schoolroom. 
She knows the symptoms of the common diseases. 
She knows what to do the moment the symptoms 
appear. 
g. A good teacher will educate the parents so that they may 
help their children to live better.

A good teacher knows when and why parents neglect 
children. 
Teachers and parents are the cause of high mortality 
among children. 
A good teacher will have a well-lighted, heated, and ven- 
tilated room. The seats will fit the pupils. The floor, 
seats, and walls will be clean. 
At home the children do not sit still for more than twenty 
minutes at a time. Twenty minutes is long enough 
for children to remain in their seats anywhere. 
Exercise, to be helpful, must be pleasant. 
An athlete is usually a good student. 
A good teacher is always on the playground at recess and 
is a playground supervisor. 
Clean teeth are more important than clean hands. If 
the teacher does not teach children how to use a tooth- 
brush, many of them will never know. 
A sound body is necessary for: 
a. Vocational efficiency 
6. Good morals 
c. Pleasure to self and others 
d. Mental strength 
e. A good personality 
Physical education demands good food, air, sleep, work, 
rest, play, clothing, habits, and sunlight. 
The fact that one-third of the men of draft age in the 
United States were physically unfit for war service was 
due to lack of physical education in the school. 
A healthy body can be had only by right living, not by 
mere knowledge.

Physical education is living, not learning; acting, not 
studying. 
Calisthenics is of little value because it is too closely 
supervised, therefore uninteresting. 
A five minutes’ run on the playground is better than ten 
minutes’ calisthenics. 
Children need opportunities for outbursts of pent-up en-

Adults won’t take calisthenics, why force it upon pupils.

Physical education must transfer to home or it fails. 
A game that is good for boys is good for girls. 
A game that is good for one grade is good for all. 
A game that is good in winter is good in summer. 
An exercise that is once good for pupils is always good 
for them. ” 
No school is justified in employing a coach for athletics 
who devotes most of his time to teams of five, nine, or 
eleven players. 
A good teacher will give physical education to the entire 
community. 
. City children are better cared for than country children. 
37: 
38. Parents take better care of stock than of children. 
Without help of parents and community, a teacher is 
helpless in giving physical education. 
Pupils will listen to a coach quicker than to others. 
Physical education does not seek size, but energy, steady 
nerves, endurance, poise, etc. 
The best exercises are automatic, playful, rhythmic. 
Splitting wood will not take the place of games. 
Playgrounds pay economically, morally, socially, men- 
tally, and pedagogically, as well as physically.

There are only four types of students: athletes, sports,

One who gets a college education at the expense of health 
has lessened his chances for success. 
A teacher’s success depends on her health. 
No one can have health without paying the price. 
It is the teacher’s duty to look after the child’s habits

To put health first means failure in one’s profession. 
The government looks after the health of live stock more 
than the health of children. 
School children should have free medical treatment. 
There should be a school nurse to every five hundred

The school nurse should visit homes as well as schools to 
see that the home environment is good. 
The nurse should educate parents in dietetics, sex edu-

A school nurse is more important than any one

V. SANITATION IN RURAL SCHOOLS 
Mintwum SANITARY REQUIREMENTS FOR RURAL SCHOOLS 
(As proposed by the Joint Committee on Health Problems in 
Education of the National Council of Education of the National 
Education Association and of the American Medical Association. 
Study these requirements and select the ones which are good for any 
school.)
-P-A-G-E-195
  
SCHOOL HYGIENE 183 
It is the desire and purpose of this committee, to help 
establish a standard of fundamental health essentials 
in the rural school and its material equipment, so that 
attainment of this minimum standard may be de- 
manded by educational authorities and by public opin- 
ion of every rural school throughout the country. 
Possession of the minimum sanitary requirements 
should be absolutely necessary to the pride and self- 
respect of the community and to the sanction and ap- 
proval of county, state, and other supervising and in- 
terested officials or social agencies. 
Neglect of anything essential for health in construc- 
tion, equipment, and care of the rural school plant is 
at least an educational sin of omission and may reason- 
ably be considered a social and civic crime or misde- 
meanor. 
The country school should be as sanitary and whole- 
some in all essential particulars as the best home in 
the community. Further, it should be pleasing and 
attractive in appearance, in furnishings, and in sur- 
roundings, so that the community as a whole may be 
proud of it; so that the pupils and teacher may take 
pleasure in attending school and in caring for and im- 
proving it. 
I. Location and Surroundings 
1. The school should be located in as healthful a place as 
exists in the community. 
2. Noise and all other objectionable factors should be 
 
-P-A-G-E-196
  184 ACQUIRING SKILL IN TEACHING 
eliminated from the immediate environment of the 
tural school. 
3. Accessibility. — Not more than two miles from the most 
distant home, if the children walk. Not more than 
six miles from the most distant home, if school wagons 
are provided. 
4. Drainage. — School ground must be well drained and as 
dry as possible. If natural drainage is not adequate, 
artificial subsoil drainage should be provided. 
'5. Soil. — As every rural school ground should have trees, 
shrubs, and a real garden or experimental farm, the 
soil of the school grounds should be fertile and tillable. 
Rock and clay soil should always be avoided. If the 
soil is muddy when wet, a good layer of fine sand and 
fine gravel should be used to make the children’s play- 
ground as useful as possible in all kinds of weather. 
6. Size of school grounds. — For the schoolhouse and play- 
ground, at least three acres are required. 
7. A playground is not a luxury but a necessity. A school 
without a playground is an educational deformity and 
presents a gross injustice to childhood. 
8. Arrangement of grounds. — The school grounds should 
have trees, plants, and shrubs grouped with artistic 
effect, but without interfering with the children’s 
playground.   II. Schoolhouse 
1. The schoolhouse should be made as nearly fireproof as 
possible. Doors should always open outward and the 
main door should have a covered entrance. A sepa- 
rate tool room should be provided, also separate 
cloak rooms for boys and girls.
-P-A-G-E-197
  SCHOOL HYGIENE 185 
2. A basement or cellar, if provided, should be well venti- 
lated and absolutely dry. 
3. The one-teacher country school should contain, in addi- 
tion to the classroom : 
a. A small entrance hall, not less than 6 by 8 feet. 
6. A small retiring-room, not less than 8 by 10 feet, to 
be used as an emergency room in case of illness or 
accident, for a teacher’s conference room, for school 
library, and for health inspection, a feature now 
being added to the work of the rural school. 
c. A domestic science room, not less than 8 by 10 feet, for 
a workshop for instruction in cooking, and for the 
preparation of refreshments when the school is used, 
as it should be, for social purposes. 
4. Classroom should be not less than 30 feet long, 20 feet 
wide, and 12 feet high. This will provide space enough 
for a maximum of thirty pupils. 
III. Ventilation 
The building and surroundings may be ideal, but without 
the guidance of teachers and parents, children will not 
grow up to be strong mentally, morally, or physically. 
The grounds must be well kept and the buildings clean 
and well ventilated. The teacher should be a living 
example of health. He or she owes it to himself or 
herself as well as to the pupils to obey the laws of health. 
The following, taken from the Bureau of Health 
Manual, should help the teacher to keep physically fit : 
“Tt is easier to maintain good health in the tropics than 
in the United States, but in order to do so you should 
observe the following simple rules : 
1. Be vaccinated to-day. The Bureau of Health will do it 
free of charge. 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
  186 ACQUIRING SKILL IN TEACHING 
Never drink any water unless it has been either boiled 
or distilled, or eat any raw vegetables. If you observe 
this rule carefully, you will probably never contract 
dysentery, typhoid fever, cholera, or any other disease 
that originates in the intestines. Disregard of this 
tule is responsible for the returning to the United States 
of over 50% of the invalids who leave these islands. 
Fruit is wholesome, and may generally be eaten raw with 
impunity, provided it is the kind that grows upon trees, 
well above the ground. 
Avoid patent medicines. ‘Do not put drugs of which 
you may know nothing into bodies of which you may 
know less.’ 
Alcoholic stimulants are not necessary, the advice of 
‘the old resident’ to the contrary notwithstanding. 
Generally disease-carrying mosquitoes fly only at night; 
therefore, always sleep under a good mosquito net.” 
IV. Lighting 
. The schoolroom should receive an abundance of light, 
sufficient for darkest days, with all parts of the room 
adequately illuminated. 
The window area should be from 4 to 4 of the floor area. 
3. The best arrangement, according to present ideas, is to 
have the light come only from the left side of the pupils 
and from the long wall of the classroom. Windows 
may be allowed on rear as well as on the left side. 
There should be no trees or shrubbery near the school- 
house which will interfere with the lighting of the class- 
room. 
The school building should so face with reference to the 
windows that the schoolroom will receive the direct 
sunlight at some time during the day.
-P-A-G-E-199
  I. 
2. SCHOOL HYGIENE 187 
Schoolroom colors. — The best colors for the school- 
room in relation to lighting are: 
Ceiling — white or light cream 
Walls — light gray-green 
Blackboards — black 
V. Cleanliness 
. The schoolhouse and surroundings should be kept as 
clean as a good housekeeper keeps her home. 
a. No dry sweeping or dusting should be allowed. 
6. Floors and furniture should be cleaned with damp 
sweepers and oily cloths. 
c. Scrubbing and airing are better than any form of 
fumigation. 
VI. Drinking Water 
Drinking water should be available for every pupil at 
any time of day which does not interfere with the 
school program. 
Every rural school should have a sanitary drinking foun- 
tain located just inside or outside the schoolhouse en- 
trance. 
Drinking water should come from a safe source. Its 
purity should be certified by an examination by the 
state board of health or by some other equally re- 
liable authority. 
A common drinking cup is always dangerous and should 
never be tolerated. 
Individual drinking cups are theoretically, and under 
some conditions, all right, but practical experience has 
proven that in schools individual cups, to be used more 
than once, are unsatisfactory and unhygienic. There-
-P-A-G-E-200
  188 ACQUIRING SKILL IN TEACHING 
fore, they are not to be advocated or approved for any 
school. 
Sufficient pressure for running water for drinking foun- 
tain or other uses in the rural school may always be 
provided from any source without excessive expense 
by a storage tank or by pressure tank with force-pump. 
VIL. Water for Washing 
.. Children in all schools should have facilities for washing 
hands available at least : 
a. Always after the use of the toilet. 
b. Always before eating. 
c. Frequently after playing outdoors, writing on black- 
board, or doing other forms of handwork connected 
with the school. 
Individual clean towels should always be used. Paper 
towels are the cheapest and most practicable. The 
common towel is as dangerous to health as the com- 
mon drinking cup. 
VIII. Furniture 
School seats and desks should be hygienic in type and 
adjusted to the size and needs of growing children. 
Seats and desks should be individual — separate — 
adjustable — clean. 
. Books and other materials of instruction should be not 
only sanitary, but attractive enough to stimulate a 
wholesome response from the pupils. 
IX. Toilets and Privies 
. Toilets and privies should be sanitary in location, in con- 
struction, and in maintenance. 
a. If water-carriage system for sewage is available, sep- '
-P-A-G-E-201
  SCHOOL HYGIENE 189 
arate toilets for boys and girls should be located in 
the schoolhouse, with separate entrances on dif- 
ferent sides or corners of the school building. 
b. If there is no water-carriage system, separate privies 
should be located at least fifty feet in different di- 
rections from the schoolhouse, with entrances well 
screened. 
c. The privy should be rainproof, well ventilated, and 
one of the following types: 
(1) Dry earth closet 
(2) Septic tank container 
(3) With a water-tight vault or box 
2. All containers of excreta should be water-tight, thor- 
oughly screened against insects, and easily emptied 
and cleaned at frequent intervals. 
3- No cesspool should be used unless it is water-tight and 
easily emptied and cleaned. 
4. All excreta should be either burned, buried, treated by 
subsoil drainage, reduced by septic tank treatment, or 
properly distributed on tilled land as fertilizer. 
X. All Schoolhouses and Privies Should Be Thoroughly and 
Effectively Screened against Flies and Mosquitoes 
XI. Schoolhouses and Outhouses Should Be Absolutely 
Free from Defacing and Obscene Marks 
XII. Buildings Should Be Kept in Good Repair 
and with Whole Windows 
STANDARDS 
The provision and equipment of an adequate school plant 
depend on the intelligence, interest, pride, and financial ability 
of the community.
-P-A-G-E-202
  190 ACQUIRING SKILL IN TEACHING 
The maintenance of a clean and sanitary school plant de- 
pends on efficient housekeeping and on the interest and the 
willing codperation of pupils. 
No community should be satisfied by the minimum require- 
ments indicated in the foregoing, but every country school 
should be so attractive and well equipped as to minister with 
some abundance of satisfaction to the physical, mental, zs- 
thetic, social, and moral well-being of those who provide it, 
who own it, who use it, and who enjoy it. 
PRESENT CONDITIONS 
Among the reasons which explain the present deplorable con- 
ditions of rural schoolhouses, the following are prominent: 
1. Low architectural and sanitary standards in rural re- 
gions generally throughout the country. 
2. Ignorance regarding-the physical, mental, social, and 
moral effects of the unattractive and insanitary 
buildings on the children and on the community as a 
whole. 
3. False economy expressed by local school boards in failure 
to vote enough money to build and maintain suitable 
school buildings. . 
4. Lack of supervision or assistance by the state, which is 
usually necessary to maintain desirable standards. 
IMPROVEMENTS 
How shall the rural schools throughout this country be im- 
proved up to a reasonably satisfactory standard ? 
1. By a popular campaign of education regarding the con- 
ditions desirable and possible for country schools. Such a 
campaign would profitably include many or most of the 
following : 
 
-P-A-G-E-203
  SCHOOL HYGIENE IQIr a . The Philippine Bureau of Education and the Bureau 
of Health and state departments of education should 
furnish plans and instructions for construction and 
equipment of school toilets. 
The United States Bureau of Education in Wash- 
ington is already supplying on request valuable help 
of this kind, and a few state departments of educa- 
tion are demonstrating what may be done by super- 
vision and support, which aid without controlling. 
6. The Director of Education has power : 
To condemn insanitary and wholly unsuitable 
buildings. If this were not so there would be 
no standard and many communities would have 
poor buildings. 
c. Ideas and standards of school sanitation should be 
inculcated in minds of local school patrons and 
school authorities who control school funds and who 
administer the affairs of the schools. Public lec- 
tures on health topics should be provided in the 
schoolhouse and elsewhere. 
d. Effective school health courses should be introduced

TEACHING is a science, but not all teachers are scien- 
tists. The teacher who has studied child nature until 
she knows how, when, and what to teach is a scientist. 
The physician who gives medicine indiscriminately 
is not a scientist. The scientific physician knows 
each individual patient and gives each one the treat-

individual pupil and gives each one what he needs. 
A physician sometimes fails to diagnose his case and 
the patient gets no better. The same thing often hap-

sential to successful teaching as knowledge of the sub- 
ject matter. 
The less that teachers know about child nature, the 
more they will have to guess at what todo. This guess

uninterested, to fail, and finally to quit school.

PREFACE 
THERE is probably no subject in the curriculum which 
offers greater possibilities for the inauguration of supervised 
study than American History. It is generally conceded, 
however, that this subject frequently has been as little under- 
stood or enjoyed, by the average boy or girl, as any subject 
studied in our elementary or secondary schools. Several 
years ago, this fact became very apparent to me in my own 
teaching. Although the pupils in my History classes ap- 
peared to be interested, I felt the lack of real enthusiasm 
and pleasure which comes from a genuine interest in a subject. 
After studying the situation for some time, I became 
thoroughly convinced that this lack of real interest was not 
so much the fault of the subject matter, as the manner in 
which this subject matter was presented. This conviction 
resulted in a careful investigation of all conditions which 
seemed to have a bearing upon the matter. It soon became 
evident that my pupils had no ability to do independent 
studying. Their only idea of study was to memorize the 
facts contained in the text. It never seemed to occur to 
them to question statements or investigate points which were 
not clear. 
Since this class was composed of boys and girls of average 
intelligence, it seemed certain that their lack of enthusiasm 
was the result of their failure to understand what they studied.

viii Preface 
This investigation proved to me the necessity of endeavoring 
to teach these children how to study. I therefore determined 
to try an experiment. All notebooks and outlines, upon 
which much time and effort had been spent, were packed 
away, and we began to study together. We made many 
mistakes, but in spite of this fact the pupils found a new 
inspiration and enjoyment in studying history. I wish to 
pay a special tribute to the first Eight A class of boys and 
girls who did so much to encourage me to make a greater 
effort for their sakes. Our first semester spent in attempting 
to learn how to study was one of the happiest experiences 
during many years of teaching. 
Much thought and study have been given to this matter in 
the years intervening since the first crude attempt. It is, 
therefore, as a result of these experiences that I have been 
persuaded to attempt this manual. The lessons outlined 
and the suggestions offered have been put in as brief and 
definite a form as possible, in the hope of giving teachers 
sufficient concrete illustrations to enable them to make 
practical application of these ideas to the needs and condi- 
tions existing in their own particular classrooms. 
An earnest plea is herein made to superintendents of schools 
and directors of courses of study, for the provision of a mini- 
mum requirement in History as well as in all other subjects. 
It will then be more possible for teachers to devote sufficient 
time to instruction in how to study the subject, without the 
fear of being unable to complete the course. ‘Training for 
self-direction”” may then become our slogan. This training 
may be accomplished by providing situations which demand 
the recognition and solution of problems. Purposive think- 
ing is essential to the successful solution of any problem.
-P-A-G-E-9

Preface ix 
Even young children are compelled to face situations which 
demand purposive thinking. Such thinking involves the rec- 
ognition of a problem, the collection and organization of 
data, the suspension of judgment, making definite decisions 
and the exercise of initiative. Each of these steps thus be- 
comes an important factor for consideration in teaching chil- 
dren how to study. Mental development and actual power are 
found to result wherever such methods of instruction are 
employed. Supervised study aims to secure development 
of this character. 
I wish to acknowledge my great indebtedness to Professor 
Alfred L. Hall-Quest, of the University of Cincinnati. His 
enthusiasm and generous support during the inauguration 
of supervised study in the Washington Junior High School 
of Rochester, N. Y., have been a source of continual inspira- 
tion. As editor of this series he has read this manual in 
manuscript form, and his constant encouragement and 
valuable suggestions have resulted in its completion. 
Special thanks are due to Dr. Frank M. McMurry, of 
Teachers College, Columbia University, and to Dr. Lida 
B. Earhart, for the first inspiration to attempt definite in- 
struction in ‘‘how to study” with my classes. To Professor 
Henry Johnson, also of Teachers College, Columbia Uni- 
versity, I am indebted for many ideas concerning the subject 
of history, all of which have been invaluable in my teaching 
experience. 
In addition, grateful appreciation is hereby rendered to 
Mr. Herbert S. Weet, Superintendent of Schools; Mr. Clinton 
E. Kellogg, Principal of the Concord Grammar School; and 
Mr. James M. Glass, Principal of the Washington Junior 
High School, Rochester, New York, all of whom have gener-

HISTORY 
CHAPTER ONE 
INTRODUCTION BY THE EDITOR 
EDUCATION VIEWED FROM THE PUPIL’S DESK 
THE pertinent question of the day in the field of education 
is — Should education fit the child or should the child fit educa- 
tion? Having evolved an increasingly complex organization 
should the educator require all school children to become cogs 
in this machinery, mere numbers or names, halting or pro- 
gressing or dropping out according to their educational fitness? 
When the questions are stated so bluntly it is. comparatively 
easy to reply in an emphatic, ‘“‘ No, of course not.” The child 
is worth more than machinery. Educational plans must be 
adapted to the child. His individuality must have right of 
way throughout the school period, for only by this method can 
he reach the finest ability to adjust himself to the shifting de- 
mands of his maturity and his social duties. If placed over 
against each other in bold contrast there doubtless isno one who 
would assign superior value to a system over that of a child. 
The contrast, however, cannot be stated so sharply and still 
do justice to the objects compared. Organization or system is 
indispensable in dealing with groups. Nearly twenty million 
children cannot be educated without careful planning, a plan- 
B rT

ning, moreover, that must ignore some of the individual dif- 
ferences inevitable in any group. All of us must sacrifice 
something for the larger social unit of which we are a necessary 
part, and to learn this lesson of social obligation early in life 
will make its wider application later in the child’s develop- 
ment somewhat less difficult. 
On the other hand, it needs to be emphasized that what is 
being organized and rearranged is a mode of educational pro- 
cedure by which each child — the active citizen of the future 
— may reach a level of ability and a state of cultural outlook 
most promising for his fellowmen. The educational output 
must be, as nearly as possible, the full-rounded exploration of 
the child’s individuality, every important agency of service in 
his being having been exercised and tested under conscientious 
and intelligent direction. The school is, or ought to be, 
the training camp of the selectives in the army of champions 
of social progress. It matters not what division they may 
enter on the completion of their training. In the school they 
are to be given the preliminary training that will make possible 
the discovery of their peculiar fitness for a particular kind of 
service, and also considerable development of skill in carrying 
out the orders that will be given them in the larger service. 
It of course is true that the pupil does not leave school a 
finished product, but at the close of his formal school career 
it is right to expect that he shall have achieved certain defi- 
nite ends which may immediately be converted into means 
for the establishing of a reasonably successful type of service. 
The organization of the school must make this individual 
attainment possible for every pupil who has demonstrated, 
under careful supervision, that he is capable of being educated. 
The child is not a mere name or a mere number on the class-
-P-A-G-E-19

roll. Heis a young life, presumably valuable to society or at 
least potentially so. The tax-payer supports the public school 
because he desires the new recruit in the various armies of 
national life to be well trained for his work. Uniformity of 
training is essential, but the fitting of each individual for his 
place in society is no less important. One without the other 
is incomplete. Organization and individual development ac- 
cording to the individuality of each pupil should go hand in 
hand. The question is not one of superiority, but of equality. 
Theoretically the foregoing conception of public school 
policy appears sound. But theories must be tested. Educa- 
tion is a practical affair. Its idealism must be made incar- 
nate in the flesh and blood of the most effective form of school 
administration. Now, how can needful organization be main- 
tained and at the same time opportunity be given each pupil 
to reach his level of self-direction? It is common knowledge 
that there already exists a variety of schemes providing for 
individual differences. The elective system, for example, is 
one of these schemes that tend to individualize educational 
procedure. Various types of promotional plans, such as 
the Pueblo and the Oregon, seek to give the individual right 
of way. Schools for supernormal and for subnormal children 
are not uncommon. Rapid and slow sections in larger schools 
are adapted to the individual’s rate of learning. In college 
and university the capable student may graduate in less than 
four years. Curriculum differentiations provide for individual 
differences. There is general recognition of the justice of 
allowing each learner to progress at his natural rate of learning. 
Among the types of organization that aim to emphasize 
education for the individual is the general plan known as 
Supervised Study. While the term itself may be new, the
-P-A-G-E-20
4 Supervised Study in History 
meaning is not altogether novel, for the conscientious teacher 
no doubt has always made room for the needful direc- 
tion of the individual’s effort. There probably are few, if 
indeed any, teachers who would refuse to aid any pupil who 
sought help honestly and discreetly. Direction of study 
takes place now and then in every school; but supervised 
study means much more than the occasional direction offered 
to pupils who request assistance. Supervised study is a 
daily undertaking. Every period of the day is organized for 
the purpose of directing the details of the learning process. 
Studying is regarded as the working on a job under the direc- 
tion of the superintendent of the shop. Because educational 
material is costly, because time and life are invaluable, the 
director of study is engaged in the conservation of mental 
effort. The hours wasted in ignorant, haphazard, discourag- 
ing, and all too often unsuccessful home study are spent in 
class study periods where a wise teacher directs the learning of 
a new assignment and reduces to an inevitable minimum the 
difficulties encountered in mastering a topic or a problem. 
Under the organization of supervised study the pupil is 
shown how to study, and he is supervised while he applies 
the principles of correct studying. Precept and supervision 
go hand in hand, as they always should do, especially in the 
undertaking of new work. This of course does not mean help- 
ing the pupil to the detriment of his initiative. School super- 
vision of reading or of writing does not destroy the initiative 
of the teachers whose work is supervised. Criticism is not a 
crutch. It is absolutely essential to success; and the pupil 
is entitled to this constructive criticism while he is working, for 
only in this way can time be saved, effort be conserved, and 
progress accelerated.
-P-A-G-E-21
Education Viewed from the Pupil’s Desk 5 
When supervised study is accepted as the prevailing method 
of classroom procedure the general aim of every period will be 
to reduce the time spent in hearing lessons and to devote most 
of the period to the direction of pupils while preparing a new 
lesson. This direction of study includes the codperative as- 
signment during which portion of the period the teacher illus- 
trates how the new lesson should be studied. The actual 
studying of the lesson really begins during the assignment, 
but the intensive or silent study follows immediately upon the 
codperative treatment of the new work. Variations of this 
general plan will be made by every ingenious teacher who 
seeks not to adopt but to adapt it to the needs and conditions 
of each class. 
In this volume Miss Simpson describes in minute detail 
one of the variations in supervised study as devised largely 
by herself and employed for a considerable time. The arrange- 
ment of groups and group assignments was evolved in coéper- 
ation with the editor of this series and on the basis of his dis- 
cussion in the volume on Supervised Study! but the details of 
all the group assignments, the planning of every lesson — 
in fact the entire contents of this volume — have been 
written by Miss Simpson; and to her clear description of 
what is being done at the Washington Junior High School of 
Rochester, N. Y., should belong all the credit. 
Certain outstanding features of the volume deserve mention 
in this connection. 
1. It is a description of an actual method of teaching, not 
what ought to be done theoretically, but what has been done 
successfully by experienced teachers. 
2. The description is very clear. Both author and editor

   6 Supervised Study in History 
have tried to produce a manual that can be understood by any 
teacher unacquainted with supervised study. Technical terms 
have been defined carefully. There is considerable repetition 
of these terms where euphony and literary style might have 
required synonyms and different kinds of sentence structure. 
To avoid confusion as much as possible terms such as Units 
of Instruction, Minimum, Average and Maximum Assign- 
ments are repeated in each lesson. 
3. The treatment is mainly suggestive. It is not expected 
that the plans here described could or should be copied in 
detail. Conditions in Rochester, N. Y., may permit a method 
of teaching that circumstances elsewhere cannot allow; but 
the plans outlined in this volume can be modified to meet 
conditions in almost any Junior High School or in any 
departmentalized Elementary School. To some extent the 
procedure might be adapted to the needs of the Senior High 
School. 
4. The author has cited many comments by pupils under 
her supervision, regarding their opinions of supervised study. 
These comments have been allowed to retain the crudity of 
undeveloped style, but the observing reader will find many of 
the quotations indicative of no little skill in composition. 
A sufficient number of these expressions of opinion have been 
cited from the four grades to show how general was the favor- 
able attitude among the pupils. The following summary of 
these comments shows their variety : 
(1) “We have definite time for review, assignment and 
study.” 
(2) “More is accomplished in less time.” 
(3) “We work on a schedule.” 
(4) “It is more practical.”
-P-A-G-E-23
Education Viewed from the Pupil’s Desk 7 
(5) ‘I have learned how to use a book.”’ 
(6) “It requires the codperation of the teacher and pupils.” 
(7) “It seems like a game.” 
(8) “It teaches pupils to ask questions.” 
(9) “We learn how to study.” 
(zo) “It teaches us to be independent.” 
(11) “It allows the pupils to do research work.” 
(12) “We have the advantage of having many different kinds of 
books from which to study.” 
(13) “The program on the board tells us what to do.” 
(14) “It makes the work easier.” 
(15) “It saves home work.” 
(16) “Socialized Recitations enable each person to express his 
ideas and thoughts about the subject.” 
(17) “It gives each pupil an equal footing with other pupils.” 
(18) “Socialized Recitations enable us to see and correct our 
errors.” 
(19) “It does not put too much time on one thing.” 
(20) “It requires self-poise and self-control.” 
5. Scattered throughout the volume the author explains 
her reasons for the plan she has followed in teaching history. 
These explanations should prevent any inference that merely 
superficial devices have been employed or that the favorable 
results in her classroom were due not so much to scientific 
method as to an enthusiastic personality. 
6. The development of the various lesson plans differs some- 
what from the theoretical forms of these lesson types. The 
variation, however, is only that which any teacher would find 
necessary in the actual work of the classroom. There is, as 
a rule, a strong likelihood that principles and technic of in- 
struction as presented in courses on these subjects will need 
considerable modification in a shifting variety of classroom 
conditions.
-P-A-G-E-24
8 Supervised Study in History 
7. Attention should be directed also to the frequent recur- 
rence of the Socialized Recitation. In fact this type of class 
management predominates, as it should in all school work. 
Miss Simpson’s success was due mainly to the employment of 
this kind of class organization. Wherever the pupil is per- 
mitted to contribute to educational material and to do so in 
his own way (under proper supervision) he is likely to be in- 
terested in the work. 
8. It will be observed that much time in these lessons is 
spent on training pupils to use the textbook, to manage assign- 
ments in reference material, and to construct worth while 
notebooks. Here we find direction in what easily becomes 
vital and independent studying. 
9. Special attention is invited to the Examination Lesson 
at the close of the book. Its uniqueness does not argue against 
its feasibility or actual value as a test. The author’s analysis 
of the questions, indicating the mental process involved in 
answering each of them, is peculiarly appropriate. It is 
another of her careful statements of reasons for her method 
of teaching. 
to. A sufficient number of lessons are outlined in detail to 
make it possible for any teacher to apply the principles in- 
volved to those which are given in less detail. The division of 
the course into Units of Instruction and Units of Recitation’ 
suggests what each teacher needs to do in order to obtain a 
prospect of her term’s work. The far-ahead look is important 
if the teacher hopes to make each day’s work fit into the large 
and well-understood purpose of the course. 
Here then is the first volume in the new series on Supervised 
Study in the Various Subjects. Other volumes will appear from 
time to time, each one to be written by some teacher who has
-P-A-G-E-25
Education Viewed from the Pupil’s Desk 9 
intimate knowledge of this type of teaching. Methods of 
dealing with supervised study will differ with the respective 
subjects and with each teacher, as well. Other teachers very 
likely would supervise study differently from the procedure 
described in this book; but here is one method that has 
awakened young pupils from lethargy and even hostility, to a 
real enthusiasm for the study of history. By this method 
they were introduced to social obligations and privileges. 
The instinct of play came to the aid of the instinct of curiosity, 
both of them all-essential in the development of the individual. 
When pupils say that studying is “like playing a game” we 
may smile with approval, in company with the shades of 
Rousseau, Pestalozzi and Froebel.

EssENTIAL Factors IN THE ORGANIZATION OF SUPERVISED 
Stupy In History 
I. Tue Unir or Recitation ! 
Tuis division of any course of study should consist of three 
functions, namely : 
1. The Daily Review. 
2. The Assignment. 
3. The Study of the Assignment. 
Each of these forms a vital part of the work of every period. 
The treatment of the daily review in the following lessons is a 
modification of the prevailing recitation as generally managed. 
Let us now consider each of the foregoing functions. 
II. Tae Nature or Eacu Part or THE UNIT 
1. The Review. — Purpose. To recall the most important 
facts taught in the lesson of the previous day. There are 
two essential reasons why this is necessary: First, to deter- 
mine how thoroughly the class understands the subject mat- 
ter previously taught; second, touse this knowledge for the 
basis of further instruction. The ‘‘Re-view” thus takes

the place of the usual formal recitation, and should be that 
portion of the period during which the pupils are given the 
opportunity to view in a new light the most vital points which 
they have previously studied. 
Method. The method of conducting the review should 
be as varied as possible. A chief consideration, however, 
should be to conduct this part of the period in such a manner 
that the pupils will be stimulated to do purposive thinking. 
There must be questions and answers, but reverse the order, 
and encourage the pupils to ask questions of the teacher or 
of one another. The teacher will then act as a guide and 
counselor rather than as an interrogator only. 
A genuine love for history, a thorough understanding of 
the great events portrayed, and a realization of the lesson 
each teaches will thus result from the future study of his- 
tory. The pupils must be aroused to consider the study 
with genuine interest. They will then become alert to the 
real, live problems presented. An actual need for purposive 
thinking will thus be created. Real thinking has been done 
only when the pupil has actually mastered the solution of a 
problem or question. This complete mastery results in thor- 
oughly understanding the problem studied. It is in this 
way that knowledge is acquired. 
It is therefore of the utmost importance that such methods 
be employed during the daily review as will aid in securing 
purposive thinking. Definite suggestions for conducting the 
“review” may be found in the lessons outlined in subsequent 
chapters. 
The Time for the Review. The first part of the period is 
naturally the most fitting time to review the work of the pre- 
ceding day. The length of the time will vary according to
-P-A-G-E-28
12 Supervised Study in History 
the needs of each lesson. Approximately one fifth of the 
" period is a very fair estimate. 
2. The Assignment. — This is the portion of the period 
during which the teacher develops new work with the class; 
enriches or supplements the facts which the pupils may find, 
by giving further detail; or explains carefully and definitely 
the work to be studied independently during the study period. 
It is during this portion of the period, also, that the pupils 
are led to realize their particular problem for consideration 
during the study period. This may frequently result in a 
codperative assignment, where pupils and teacher, working 
together, organize the work to be studied. Here the teacher 
works largely through the suggestions of the pupils in out- 
lining the material to be studied after their problem is thor- 
oughly understood. 
3. Study of the Assignment. — Professor Hall-Quest, in 
his book “Supervised Study,” very clearly shows the impor- 
tance of dividing any class into three distinct groups, — the« 
superior, the average, and the inferior. As soon as a teacher 
is able to determine to which group each pupil belongs, it is 
advisable to reseat the class according to these groups. This 
should be done in order that the teacher may easily locate 
those who need special consideration. These groups might be 
called: <SA\?. “CBy? “CC,” tor.“ First;# '/Second,’? Third? 
Their real significance should not be told to the pupils. 
Since we shall find three distinct ‘groups in the class, it 
necessitates a provision for three distinct divisions in our 
assignment. Professor Hall-Quest speaks of these as the 
minimum, average, and maximum assignments. The mini- 
mum assignment is the amount required of the-inferior group, 
and of the whole class. Both the minimum and average
-P-A-G-E-29
Factors in Organization of Supervised Study 13 
assignments might be accomplished by the average group of 
pupils, while the maximum assignment would be prepared 
only by those pupils who have completed the minimum and 
average assignments. 
The minimum assignment would, of necessity, include the 
minimum essentials of the course of study. The average 
and maximum thus afford an excellent opportunity for an 
enrichment of the minimum requirement by the use of source 
material, bibliography, newspaper and magazine articles, etc. 
The school library has a wealth of material which will fur- 
nish ample suggestion in providing for these assignments. 
Sets of supplementary histories are also helpful. Pupils 
need training in comparing the texts of different authors. 
Young pupils are far too willing to accept the facts of a single 
text as final. Average and maximum assignments do much 
Ao overcome such conditions.

IU. Tae Datry Procram or Time SCHEDULE FOR EacH 
tes PERIoD 
This may contain a suggestion to be adapted to the con- 
ditions or needs of a particular school. Its greatest value lies 
in making the pupils conscious that a given amount of work 
must be accomplished within a definite period. Experience 
has proved that the time schedule aids in developing the 
power to concentrate upon the thing of the moment. This is 
very important if one wishes to do a given task in a specified 
time. There is no strain or hurry when the teacher has 
planned only enough to be accomplished in the allotted time. 
This time schedule is written upon the board where every 
member of the class may easily see it. A pupil is appointed 
to act as time-keeper. His name is also written on the board. 
   
-P-A-G-E-30
14 Supervised Study in History 
This “ time-keeper ” keeps account of the time, and at the 
end of each part of the program stands and announces that 
the time is up for that particular part of the period. The 
responsibility for the success of the work accomplished during 
the period is thus shared by both pupils and teacher. Each 
child feels that he has a personal responsibility toward the 
work, and this guarantees the success of the lesson. 
If the grade is a Seven B ! (first half of the seventh year), a 
different time-keeper might be appointed for each part of the 
period. The pupils greatly enjoy this, and it is one means of 
socializing the work. A pupil who acts as time-keeper is not, 
however, excused from taking an active part in the class work. 
1In all references to “grades” throughout this manual, the first half of the 
year’s work will be indicated as a “B” Grade, while “A” Grades will represent 
the latter half of the year. All lessons planned for pupils of the “Seventh B 
Grade” may thus be interpreted as referring to pupils who are just entering 
the seventh grade. Seventh A or Eighth A pupils are those who are completing 
the last twenty weeks of either grade.

CHAPTER THREE 
DIVISIONS OF AMERICAN HISTORY 
As a means of evaluating the course and making its develop- 
ment definite and comprehensive the teacher will need to analyze 
the subject matter into various units of teaching. For the sake 
of convenience and as a suggestion in the effort to make educational 
terminology specific in meaning, these divisions are called “Units 
of Instruction” and “Units of Recitation.” The nature of these 
in this course is analyzed in this chapter. The course of study 
prepared by Mr. Charles E. Finch, Director of Courses of Study 
for the Washington Junior High School, Rochester, N. Y., is 
very largely the basis for the divisions of units of instruction 
and units of recitation outlined in the following pages. Only 
such reorganization has been made as seemed necessary in order 
to be consistent with the lessons suggested in this manual. 
A. Units or INSTRUCTION. 
I. The dawn of history and early leaders of civilization. 
II. Events leading to the discovery of America. 
Ill. The discovery and exploration of America. 
IV. The colonization of America. 
V. The Intercolonial Wars. 
VI. The revolution of the English colonists in America. 
VII. The Critical Period. — Making the Constitution and 
starting the new government. 
America’s struggle for commercial independence. 
The slavery question. 
The Civil War. 
The period of reconstruction.

XII. Theinfluence of transportation and methods of communi- 
cation upon the development of the nation. 
XIII. Territorial expansion of the United States. 
XIV. Important national issues. 
B. Tue Divisions or Eacu Unit oF INSTRUCTION INTO 
Units or RECITATION. 
The subject matter contained in a course of study on his- 
tory might be grouped under such headings as those sug- 
gested above under “‘ Units of Instruction.” The thoughtful 
teacher and those directly concerned in preparing courses of 
study will agree, however, that a more minute consideration of 
subject matter must be made in order to determine what shall 
be retained and what shall be eliminated. 
This, then, necessitates the division of each unit of instruc- 
tion into other units which may be designated as “ Units of 
Recitation.”” The importance of the subject matter under 
consideration will be a factor in determining the number of 
units of recitation under a specific unit of instruction. The 
following subdivisions of each unit of instruction into units of 
recitation may aid the teacher of history to make a careful 
evaluation of the subject matter in a prescribed course. The 
importance of such an evaluation is self-evident.   
I. Tue Dawn or History anD EARLY LEADERS OF CIVILIZA- 
TIon. Under this main unit there might be five sub-units, 
as follows: 
Units of Recitation: 
1. Eastern nations of ancient times: Egyptians, Chaldeans, 
Pheenicians, Hebrews, Persians. 
2. The Greeks. 
3. The Romans. 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
Divisions of American History D7, 
4. The Germans and Romans — “ The Dark Ages.” 
5. The English. 
These subdivisions do not imply that only one lesson 
should be given upon each unit of recitation, but merely out- 
line in a general way the most essential topics to be considered 
under the first unit of instruction. Some units of recitation 
require more lessons than others. The number of lessons 
given upon each unit of recitation must necessarily be in- 
fluenced by varying conditions in different schools, therefore 
this is merely suggestive. Because of the wide variation in 
courses, each course must be considered independently. 
Units of instruction and recitation must be made to fit the 
demands of courses in individual school systems. 
II. Events Leapinc To THE Discovery oF AMERICA. 
Units of Recitation: 
1. The three great periods of history. 
2. The Crusades and results. 
3- Marco Polo and the influence of his travels on European 
explorers. 
4. The effect on European commerce of the fall of Con- 
stantinople. 
5. “ The revival of learning ” or ‘‘ The Renaissance.” 
Ill. THe Discovery AND EXPLORATION OF AMERICA. 
Units of Recitation: 
1. The Discovery: 
a. The voyages of the Northmen. 
6. Columbus and the results of his voyages. 
c. The Cabots. 
d. Amerigo Vespucci. 
c

a. The Spanish. 
6. The French. 
c. The Dutch. 
d. The English. 
3. Claims of European Nations in the New World. 
4. The Natives of America : — How they lived. 
A much more detailed study of history should now begin 
with the study of this unit of instruction. This will necessi- 
tate a longer period of time. The teaching of ‘‘ Community 
Civics” and Current Events, which are generally included 
with the history, demands that the time must be divided 
among the three in such proportion as the courses of study 
in each school system require. 
The material suggested under the three units of instruction 
listed above would seem to furnish a fair minimum require- 
ment to be accomplished by the pupils in one semester. If 
less is required in the amount of subject matter, more may be 
accomplished in giving the pupils proper instruction in how 
to study such subject matter. 
IV. THE COLONIZATION OF AMERICA. 
Units of Recitation: 
1. The Struggle for English Liberty. 
a. Charters: William the Conqueror; Henry1I; Richard I. 
6. King John and the Magna Charta. 
c. The First Representative Parliament. 
d. The Establishment of the Regular Parliament.

2. English Colonies in America. 
a. A detailed study of four colonies: Virginia; Massa- 
chusetts; New York; Pennsylvania. 
b. A general consideration of the other nine original 
colonies. 
A careful study of the four colonies listed above, in relation 
to conditions existing in England, will serve as types. Only a 
general consideration of the other colonies seems necessary 
in order to determine the object of the settlers, and the success 
of the colony.

It is best to avoid a detailed study of these wars. This unit 
may be considered of minor importance, and should serve only 
as a connecting link for the study of the following unit. 
VI. THE REVOLUTION OF THE ENGLISH COLONIES IN 
AMERICA. 
Units of Recitation: 
1. Causes of the war. 
2. Defenders of the American Cause. 
a. In America — Samuel Adams — Patrick Henry. 
b. In England — William Pitt — Edmund Burke. 
. Attitude of King George III. 
The beginning of the war.

The greater portion of time allotted to the study of this 
unit should be devoted to a consideration of such topics as are

suggested above, rather than to a detailed study of campaigns 
or battles.

2. The War of 1812. 
a. Immediate causes. 
6. Results. 
A detailed study of this war is unnecessary. Any events, 
however, which are of interest as local history should be 
studied. A definite idea will be obtained through collateral 
reading upon such topics as “ Perry’s Victory on Lake Erie,” 
“The Attack upon Baltimore,” etc.

quires careful attention to all the leading events con- 
cerning the great question of slavery, from its introduc-

to-day.

CHAPTER FOUR 
THE DAILY LESSON SCHEDULE AND ASSIGNMENT SHEET 
For the purpose of uniformity as well as for future refer- 
ence a daily assignment sheet is of the utmost importance. 
The forms given on pages 29-30 merely illustrate how this 
might be undertaken. The first form shows a page from 
a teacher’s Plan Book, as it would appear before the plan 
for the day had been prepared. ‘The second form shows 
the entries made under each heading on the Assignment: 
Sheet. ; : 
1. How to Prepare the Assignment Sheet. — This should 
be done in as brief a manner as possible. It is well to avoid 
all lengthy and unnecessary detail. A suggestive outline is 
all that is necessary. The chief purpose of this sheet is to 
serve as a guide and a source of future reference. It is in- 
valuable as a record of the work accomplished during a 
semester, and helps both teacher and supervisor to carry out 
the prescribed course in a systematic way. 
The column headed “‘ Remarks” should be used in any way 
which proves to be of the greatest benefit to the teacher. It is 
of particular value in affording space for noting the best ref- 
erences upon the lesson studied. The success or the failure 
of the lesson may also be noted and the reason given, such as 
“too long,” “ chief difficulty,” etc. This is helpful in plan- 
ning subsequent lessons. : 
26 
 
-P-A-G-E-43
The Daily Lesson Schedule and Assignment Sheet 27 
The three divisions under the “‘ Study of the Assignment” 
should be the only part of the assignment sheet where detailed 
information should be given. A copy of this should be 
written upon the board for the pupils to consult during their 
study period. (See “Study of the Assignment ” under each 
lesson.) - 
The space marked “ Student Daily Grouping ” indicates 
the accomplishment of the class during the silent study period. 
The figure ‘9 ” under “ Minimum ” means that nine pupils 
had not reached the average part of the assignment. They 
were either still working on the minimum or had just com- 
pleted it at the end of the study period. The same is true of 
the figures under the average and maximum. 
This result should be determined by the teacher at the close 
of the study period, and the entry made in the plan book 
at that time. The value of noting this fact is that it serves 
as a check upon the plan of the lesson. It helps the teacher 
to determine whether the lesson is too long for the time to 
be devoted to it, or whether it is within the ability of the 
pupils for whom it is planned. 
2. When to Prepare the Assignment Sheet. — These plans 
should be made only from day to day. It is necessary to 
estimate the amount of work to be covered in a week, but it 
is not practicable to plan a series of lessons for an entire week. 
The results of each lesson from day to day will determine the 
kind of lesson which should be prepared for the following 
day. ‘ 
The plan for each day’s-work should be made to meet the 
need of the class at that particular stage of their development. 
A wise teacher learns to recognize what these needs are and 
thus plans accordingly.
-P-A-G-E-44
28 Supervised Study in History 
The factors of study described in books on “‘ How to Study ”’! 
should be given careful consideration in every lesson. Pur- 
posive thinking naturally results when lessons provide for the 
development of the child through definite training along these 
lines. 
3. The Size of the Assignment Sheets.— Teachers will 
probably agree with the author that for general usefulness 
the letter size is preferable to the smaller note size. In some 
schools the forms are printed in the school shop by the pupils. 
The loose leaf arrangement is convenient both for supplemen- 
tation and for permanent record. 
1 Teachers who are interested in gaining definite information concerning 
teaching pupils how to study should read “‘ How to Study and Teaching How to 
Study,” by F. M. McMurry, Houghton Mifflin Co.; “Teaching Children to 
Study,” by Lida B. Earhart, Houghton Mifflin Co.; “How to Study Effec- 
tively,” by Guy M. Whipple, School and Home, Bloomington, Ill.; ‘How to 
Learn Easily,” by H. D. Kitson, Lippincott; ‘How to Use Your Mind,” by

-P-A-G-E-49
FIRST SECTION 
SEVEN B GRADE 
LESSON I 
THE INSPIRATIONAL PREVIEW 
1. Need. — Upon meeting a new class for the first time, the 
“ Inspirational Preview ” is of great value to both pupils and 
teacher. This type of lesson gives the teacher the opportu- 
nity to inspire the class and to create a desire to study the sub- 
ject further, through helping the pupils to recognize and under- 
stand its practical value for each member of the class. 
2. Purpose.— The purpose of such a lesson is twofold: 
First: To reach and arouse the varying interests existing 
among the pupils. Second: To provide a background for 
further study of the subject matter to be taught during the 
term or the year, as the case may be. 
3. Varying Interests or Individual Differences. — The vary- 
ing interests in a normal class seem to be divided into three 
distinct groups. The pupil of the first group is naturally 
interested in all aspects of school life, is particularly fond of 
history, enjoys reading, and will acquire a vast amount of 
information in spite of the teacher’s method of approach or 
procedure in teaching the subject matter of a prescribed 
course. This type of pupil gives us little immediate concern. 
The inspirational preview will particularly interest such a 
pupil, however, by giving him a broad conception of some of 
D 33
-P-A-G-E-50
  34 The Inspirational Preview 
the pleasures in store for him through the anticipation of some 
of the “ high peaks ” throughout the course. 
The second and third types are the ones for which the 
lesson should be chiefly planned and taught. The second 
type is the kind of pupil who is satisfied with a superficial 
knowledge of any subject. He touches only the surface 
of things in his studying, and his interest is soon lost. 
He has never learned to think to a purpose, and thus 
has vague impressions rather than definite opinions. He 
may be reached by being impressed with the vast amount of 
knowledge the teacher has acquired. Subsequent lessons 
in “ How to Study ” will benefit such a pupil if his interest 
and enthusiasm can be aroused early in the term. 
The third type gives one equally as much concern as the 
second. This type is represented by the pupil who has never 
liked history, and has, consequently, always found it difficult 
and uninteresting. He enters the class with a strong preju- 
dice against the subject. This must be overcome, if either the 
teacher or the pupil is to make any progress. Such a pupil is 
easily recognized by his general attitude. The lack of interest 
which is so apparent in his face quickly informs the teacher 
that here is the pupil who must be aroused and encouraged 
to find himself. This gives us the main purpose of a lesson 
of this character. The second purpose is subordinated to the 
first, and will result from it. 
4. The Nature of an Inspirational Preview. — What is the 
nature of such a lesson? Let us briefly consider some of its 
chief characteristics. 
The first great essential consideration is to evaluate the 
course as a whole, — that is, the subject matter to be taught 
during a term or year. Note the topics of supreme impor-
-P-A-G-E-51
The Inspirational Preview 35 
tance, — those which will require the most study, and to 
which the greatest amount of time should be given. Others 
of minor importance may be taught in a less detailed way. 
Determine also how much time should be given (number of 
lessons) to each topic or division of subject matter, to cover 
the required amount in the specified time. We have pre- 
viously spoken of these divisions as “‘ Units of Instruction.” 
After dividing the course into units of instruction, select 
the ones which would particularly appeal to an average class, 
as the ones you wish to emphasize during this lesson. The 
units to be studied at the beginning of the term need particular 
consideration for the purpose of creating enthusiasm for the 
subsequent detailed study of each unit. 
5. Method of Procedure. — Begin the lesson by asking a 
few pupils to tell something they consider interesting about 
any person or event in history, which they have previously 
studied. This should be done merely to create an atmosphere 
of friendliness and responsiveness among the pupils, and 
should consume a very small part of the period. If the pupils 
give any facts which might be used as a basis for the introduc- 
tion of the preview of the course for the term, it would be 
well to make any use of such information as seems most ad- 
visable. If, however, none is offered, briefly outline the 
work of the course in as simple and interesting a way as 
possible. 
By mentioning the most important units of instruction, 
and emphasizing those which will aid in creating an interest, 
give the class a bird’s-eye view of what is ahead of them. 
Avoid labeling anything as difficult. Give the pupils a feeling 
of how much you personally enjoy history, and what great 
pleasure there is in store for each member of the class, Use 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  36 Supervised Study in History 
the blackboard, pictures and maps as illustrative material, 
and help the pupils actually to live in imagination the scenes 
or events you portray for them. Tell a few anecdotes about 
the great men they will meet during the course, — the human 
kind of story rather than the bare historical fact. An occa- 
sional question to stimulate thought will also do much to 
secure the desired result. Urge the pupils to look for and 
bring to class any pictures, maps, magazine articles or books 
relating to any of the topics mentioned during the lesson. 
Conclude the lesson with a very brief summary. If possible, 
call upon members of the class to summarize the lesson. 
Give the class something pleasurable to look forward to in the 
new lesson for the next day. 
After a lesson of this type, conducted by an animated 
teacher who has a broad knowledge of the subject matter, one 
will find the class returning on the following day, eager to 
study in detail some of the fascinating things disclosed to them 
during the preceding preview. 
6. Possible Errors to be Avoided. —It is well not to at- 
tempt too much in a lesson of this kind. The purpose of the 
lesson is to arouse interest in the work of the term, rather 
than to leave deep impressions of any definite subject matter. 
The less important units of instruction should merely be 
mentioned or omitted entirely. 
Lengthy and uninteresting detail should be avoided. 
Brief accounts are much more effective. Much depends upon 
the manner in which the lesson is conducted. Frequently 
subject matter which otherwise might be dry and uninteresting 
to pupils becomes alive with interest, if presented in an at- 
tractive way. It is not so much a matter of moment what we 
teach as how we teach it.

The above Time Schedule, and those of all subsequent 
lessons, are particularly planned for a ninety-minute period. 
This is the length of the period in operation in the Washington 
Junior High School, Rochester, N. Y., as well as in many other 
schools. 
The purpose of the ninety-minute period is to make it 
possible for lessons to be prepared under the supervision of the 
teacher. This affords an excellent opportunity to give definite 
instruction in ‘ How to Study,” which has proved of the 
greatest value in overcoming careless, wasteful habits acquired 
in undirected home study. Much can be done, however, 
during a forty-five or a sixty-minute period, where home study 
is required, if special attention is given to the method em- 
ployed in the assignment for home study. 
The following time schedules may be suggestive :

The Review. — Since this is the first lesson following the 
“Inspirational Preview,” the review might be conducted in 
the following manner : 
Distribute to the class small slips of paper previously pre- 
pared by the teacher ; one-half of the slips containing a number 
only, the other half containing two numbers and a question. 
If there were thirty pupils in the class, the slips would be 
numbered from one to thirty inclusive. The first fifteen should 
contain a question and a number from 76 to 30. (See illus- 
tration.)

The slips containing numbers from 76 to 30 should contain no 
question. 
Briefly explain to the class the method of procedure as
-P-A-G-E-55
Inductive and How to Study Lesson 39 
follows: the pupil having Slip No. 1 will stand, read the 
question aloud and call the number found after the question. 
The pupil having the slip containing the number called will be 
expected to stand and answer the question. If this pupil is 
unable to answer the question, any member of the class who 
can answer may stand. The teacher may then call upon 
any of those standing to answer. Brief, accurate statements 
must be required. 
The fifteen questions should aim to recall the vital points 
in the preview of the previous day. The following are merely 
suggestive : 
1. What were some of the things about which we were told 
yesterday ? 
2. Why is history valuable to us as a study? 
3. Tell something about any topic mentioned yesterday which 
particularly interested you. Why? 
4. What pictures were shown to us? 
5. What pictures did you like best? Why? 
6. Locate on the wall map the countries about which we are 
to study. 
7. What great men in history were mentioned yesterday? 
8. Which men do you think you would like to know more 
about? Why? 
9. Tell anything you remember about any one of the great men 
mentioned. 
zo. What do you think is a reason why people remember about 
these men? 
11. For what are we to look, outside of school, as we study 
History this term? 
12. Why do we need to read the newspaper daily? 
13. Name other sources from which we may find valuable in- 
formation during our study of History. 
14. About whom are we to study first ? 
15. What would you like to know about these people?

Benefits of this Kind of Review. 
Bearing in mind that reviews as utilized in many classrooms 
are lifeless and therefore result in poorly motivated drill, let 
us note the value of the kind here discussed. 
1. It creates a social atmosphere. 
2. It provides an opportunity for each member of the class 
to take an active part in the lesson. 
3. It stimulates independent thought and judgment; and it 
develops “ initiative.” 
4. It helps to recall the most important topics discussed in 
the previous lesson for the purpose of furnishing a foundation 
upon which to build the new lesson. 
5. It enables the teacher to discover and correct any wrong 
impression. This is important. 
The Assignment. 
1. Explanation and information given by the teacher. 
2. The recognition of the Problem by the class. 
3. Definite instruction in How to Study. The proper use 
of the textbook. 
Explanation and Information Given by the Teacher. 
Brief account of the beginning of history. 
Meaning of B.c. and A.D. 
The three periods of history :—ancient, medieval, modern. 
The Problem for Consideration, or What Must be Understood. 
What people were the first among the early leaders of civili- 
zation and why? It is well at the beginning of the term, and 
especially with pupils of the Seven B Grade, to state their 
problem for them. Then impress it upon their attention by 
frequently having it restated. In this way they will acquire 
the habit of having a definite thing in mind when they take up 
their books, and, from the beginning, can be taught to consider 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-57
Inductive and How to Study Lesson 4l 
and collect only such data as have a definite bearing upon the 
problem to be solved. 
This problem should be written upon the board. The pupils 
may then be asked how they are to find any information which 
will help them to understand this topic. This will result in 
their realizing their need for the textbook. 
Instruction in How to Study and How to Use the Text- 
book (teacher working with the class). This part of the 
assignment deals with very definite directions as to how the 
pupils should attack the preparation of the new lesson. These 
initial directions pertain to some preliminary matters that 
are usually neglected by both younger and older students alike. 
The aim here is to emphasize the importance of knowing the 
name and purpose of one’s tools. 
1. How many things can you tell me about this book 
after reading what is printed on the outside only? 
2. Turn to the first page containing printing. Read it; 
compare it with the words on the outside of the book, and tell 
me what you find on this page which you did not find on the 
outside cover. 
3. What is this page called and why? (If no one knows, 
tell the class and write term on the board.) 
4. Read the Preface and be ready to tell why it is needed. 
The teacher should allow sufficient time for each pupil to 
read. Then the meaning of the word, why the author placed 
this brief statement at the beginning of his book, and its 
value to the reader, may be discussed with profit. While this 
type of work may not have as great significance for the under- 
standing of history in the grades, the forming of habits along 
this line should begin early. Books frequently are misunder- 
stood because readers do not know the author’s point of view.
-P-A-G-E-58
  42 Supervised Study in History 
To train the pupil to pay some attention to preface and title 
page will prove increasingly helpful as he progresses in his 
education. 
. 5. Why does a book have a Table of Contents, and why is 
it placed in the front of the book? 
6. How many chapters does this book contain? 
7. Read the titles of the chapters and select the one you 
think may give us information about the first people who 
were the leaders of civilization. 
Having completed this preliminary study the teacher now 
begins a more direct approach to the first study of the subject 
matter. The following procedure has been used by the author. 
1. Glance at the first page of this chapter, and without 
reading it, tell me what you notice about this page. (Differ- 
ent types of print are recognized. The teacher explains the 
reason for using these different types, if the pupils cannot.) 
2. How many paragraphs do you find under the heading 
written in heavy type? 
3. Select the proper names on this page which might be 
difficult for you to pronounce. (Martin Waldseemiiller, 
Americus Vespucius, for example.) 
4. Find the end of the chapter, and see if you can obtain 
any help. 
(The Pronouncing List is referred to. Explain to the class 
that some books have this list at the end of the book rather 
than after each chapter. Also tell them how to find the rae 
pronunciation, if the book has no list.) 
5. On page 2 (of the text), why are ‘wo sentences written 
in different type? Give term for this. 
6. Quickly read the three paragraphs under the first topic, 
and decide whether they are of value to us in collecting infor-
-P-A-G-E-59
Inductive and How to Study Lesson 43 
mation concerning our problem. (Obtain the opinion of the 
class by asking how many think it is valuable, and how many 
do not. If the majority of the class have made the right 
decision, call upon a pupil who is incorrect or uncertain, to 
give his reason; then help him to see why he is wrong. Write 
upon the board a brief statement of any fact, recognized by 
the pupils as having a direct relation to the problem under 
consideration. At every step of the lesson, encourage the 
pupils to ask questions. It is the best proof we can have of 
definite, purposive thinking.) 
7. In the same way, read the next two paragraphs. 
8. Consult the small map on the next page for location of 
Nile and Euphrates Rivers, — Egypt and Chaldea. Then 
locate these two places with relation to America, on a wall 
map of the world. 
9. Before reading about the Egyptians, question the class 
to aid them in determining the important facts for which they 
should look. Some brief outline such as the following should 
be written on the board before beginning to read : 
The Egyptians. — Who they were. 
Where they lived. 
What they did. 
to. Under the topic, “‘ Egyptians,”’ decide how many para- 
graphs or pages are devoted to the subject. 
11. When should we make a careful study of the illustra- 
tions which a book contains? 
12. Read silently all information given about the Egyp- 
tians. Then make a list of the great things they accomplished. 
(Allow sufficient time for this. Work with any who seem to 
have difficulty.)
-P-A-G-E-60
44 Supervised Study in History 
13. What was our problem for to-day? 
14. How many have found help in answering or solving it ? 
15. How many think they have solved it? 
16. How many would like to know more about these people ? 
17. Tell the pupils why there is not time in class to make 
a detailed study of the Egyptians. Determine how many have 
books at home or who could go to the library, and be ready to 
tell the class the next day any valuable information they have 
found. Insist upon their being able to give the source of their 
information, and to bring the book to class, if possible. 
Also encourage pupils to bring any pictures of Egypt which 
they may find. 
A list on the board of all supplementary reading, with the 
name of the pupil accomplishing it, will arouse great enthu- 
siasm among the pupils, and will be invaluable as a means of 
securing a love for history. 
Conclude the lesson at this point. Do not attempt to de- 
termine how well they have mastered the facts contained in the 
subject. This will be done in the review on the following day. 
Our chief purpose at this time is to attempt to create a liking 
for history, by giving the class a glimpse of how to study it. 
Since this is the first lesson where a textbook is used, it 
seems more advisable for the teacher to work with the class as 
awhole. The suggestions contained in the above lesson have, 
therefore, been planned for the entire class. 
The group assignments should begin in the next lesson. 
If the teacher has not been able to determine to which group 
(superior, average or inferior) each pupil belongs, the promo- 
tion marks might furnish a very safe basis for organizing the 
class into the distinctive groups. Changes should be madefrom 
one group to another, however, whenever the need is apparent.

to. Briefly summarize the most important facts we have studied 
about the Egyptians. 
The pupils should have a few moments to read these ques- 
tions and think about what they studied the previous day. 
Call upon a pupil to read the first question aloud and then 
answer it. If the answer is incorrect or incomplete, encourage 
the other members to stand as quickly as the one reciting has 
finished, if they have a question or additional fact. Help 
them to state their questions definitely. In the same way guide 
them in judging the worth of a statement by deciding whether 
it answers the question asked, or contains unnecessary detail. 
Continue this method until each question has been read, 
answered, discussed and the answer accepted or rejected by 
the class. The one reciting should be required to come to the 
front of the room and face the class while he recites. 
This form of a review is valuable because it provides for the 
development of initiative, gives training in purposive thinking, 
places the responsibility upon the pupils and makes them 
alert in realizing their own mistakes as well as those of other 
pupils. Many other features may be introduced into this 
kind of a review as the pupils gain in power, such as Judges, 
Record Keeper, etc. 
Conclude the review by devoting the last five minutes to

Inductive and How to Study Lesson 47 
additional brief reports as a result of outside reading; also 
the description of any pictures found. A list of these sup- 
plementary data might well be kept upon the board. It 
serves as an incentive to others. 
The Assignment. — In this lesson the method of procedure 
is outlined as follows: 
1. Explanation of the fact that the Egyptians were not the 
only leaders of civilization in ancient times. 
2. Development of the idea of the new problem: Who, 
besides the Egyptians, were known for their civilization in 
ancient times, and why? 
3. Definite directions and explanations necessary for under- 
taking the work to be accomplished during the silent study 
period. 
Explanation given by the Teacher. This part of the assign- 
ment requires only a few brief statements to make it clear 
to the class that the Egyptians were not alone as leaders. 
Development of New Problem. To make the pupils con- 
scious of their problem, ask them to put in the form of a ques- 
tion what we must discover if the Egyptians were not the only 
leaders of civilization. They will readily ask, “ What other 
people besides the Egyptians were known for their civiliza- 
tion?”’ Accept the wording given by the class if it expresses 
what is required. Always write the problem upon the board. 
The pupils are now told to open the book selected for this 
lesson? to the page containing the last paragraph about the 
1 Woodburn & Moran. Anattempt is made throughout this manual to use 
a variety of books for reference. Just as far as it is possible, teachers 
should avoid using one text as the only source of information. The many 
advantages derived from using several texts are very apparent. References 
should not be given in a haphazard way, but use should be made of such as are 
particularly valuable for the topic or problem to be studied.

from 8 to 18 of the text and select the names in heavy type.

Young pupils, especially, need to be trained in the develop- 
ment of a liberal viewpoint concerning all matters. The 
conclusions reached by pupils after consulting one text only 
are not merely limited, but often erroneous. The teacher who 
constantly keeps before the pupils the necessity of a generous, 
open-minded consideration of all problems, will do a kind of 
work in history teaching that is much finer than the memoriz- 
ing of facts alone. Pupils who learn that their opinions and 
decisions are valueless unless they have definite reasons and can 
prove they have investigated the matter thoroughly enough 
to have a right to such opinions, are being trained in the kind 
of thinking that results in good citizenship. What subject in 
the curriculum offers better opportunities for such training? 
Directions for the Silent Study Period. —The work to be ac- 
complished during the Silent Study Period should be definitely 
outlined on the board before the beginning of the recitation. 
For the first few lessons, it will be necessary to give a careful 
explanation of what is to be done, until the pupils are familiar 
with the method. Ultimately the written statements, if 
definite, will be self-explanatory. Speak of the minimum 
assignment as the “ First Part,”’ — the average, as the “ Sec- 
ond Part,’’ and the maximum, as the “ Third Part.’ For  
-P-A-G-E-65
Inductive and How to Study Lesson 49 
convenience in determining the enrollment in each part repre- 
sent each with a Roman numeral. Write the assignment 
upon the board in the following manner : 
Study of the Assignment. 
I or Minimum Assignment. 
1. Read very carefully all information found from pp. 8 to 
17 about the Chaldeans, the Phoenicians, the Hebrews and 
the Persians. 
2. Locate the section of the ancient world occupied by each 
of these nations. (Map opposite p. 4.) 
3. After completing 1 and 2, close your books, and write a 
brief statement about each to prove how they were leaders 
in the civilization of ancient times. 
II or Average Assignment. 
4. Write on the blackboard the names of the people about 
whom we have studied, and in one sentence after each name 
tell what you think is the most important fact to remember 
about each. 
III or Maximum Assignment. 
5. Read again the last paragraph on p. 17; then write a 
paragraph of your own, telling why we begin the study of 
American history by studying briefly about the people of 
ancient times. 
The Teacher’s Responsibility during the Silent Study 
Period. — During this period the teacher has an opportunity 
to give special attention to individual pupils. The average 
and maximum assignments provide for the superior type of 
pupil. The inferior group may now be given careful considera- 
tion. This does not mean, however, that help is not to be 
given to the others. They frequently need attention, par- 
ticularly in regard to better ways of working. 
Ez
-P-A-G-E-66
  50 Supervised Study in History 
Guard against permitting the pupils to make a crutch of 
the teacher. Give assistance only where it is evident that 
there is a difficulty to overcome. Avoid telling them what 
they can determine for themselves. . Help them to reason by 
questioning, rather than by giving them the information. 
Conclusion. — The papers written by the class during the 
study period should be collected and reviewed by the teacher. 
Brief notes of the most serious difficulties must now be made, 
particularly such as concern false impressions and wrong 
habits in studying. No attempt should be made to rate and 
return the papers. Merely list the names of pupils needing 
special attention. These should be given particular attention 
on the following day, during the review and study. In this 
way a teacher quickly locates those pupils who belong to each 
of the three groups, inferior, average or superior. 
Any statements written upon the board should be corrected 
with the class before it is dismissed. A few moments of the 
time for the study of the assignment might be used for this 
purpose. Encourage the pupils to suggest any necessary 
corrections. All the pupils will derive some benefit from this 
work, even though it has not been accomplished by each 
child. 
Suggestions on “‘ Study of the Assignment” for a Forty- 
five-minute or Sixty-minute Schedule. — Teachers in schools 
organized on a basis of a forty-five-minute or a sixty-minute 
schedule might find the following suggestions helpful if 
home study is required. A time schedule might be adopted 
as suggested for a ninety-minute period. Less time should be 
given to each division, however. (See page 38.) The review 
could be conducted in the same manner as outlined for a longer 
period. In the assignment special emphasis should be put   
      
  
     
-P-A-G-E-67
Inductive and How to Study Lesson 51 
upon helping the class to understand exactly what is to be 
done during the study period at home. 
Assignment Notebooks. — Assignment notebooks would 
be of great value here. After the teacher has developed the 
problem and gone over, in detail, each point to be studied, 
after references have been found by the pupils, and pages 
for each topic noted on the board, each pupil should then copy 
in his notebook the assignment previously written upon the 
board. This assignment could be very similar to the one 
planned in Lesson III and other lessons. 
The maximum assignment for home study might frequently, 
however, provide for an amplification of the minimum and 
average assignments, through consideration of any supplemen- 
tary material the pupils could obtain. This naturally would 
have a very wide range, and would depend upon the individual 
pupil, according to opportunities afforded each through access 
to home or public libraries. It would stimulate and influence 
outside reading and would aid in training the pupil to do 
research work successfully. This will need careful attention 
and direction at the beginning until the pupils begin to realize 
the enjoyment there is in this type of studying. 
A definite time limit should be decided upon by the teacher 
in planning the lesson. Each pupil should be directed to keep 
his own record after each assignment, in the following way: 
Time required for home study . . 35 min. 
(This time should vary according to lesson and grade ) 
Actual time spent in home study . (50 min.)

This plan may not be as satisfactory in some respects as 
that of having the entire lesson prepared in the class under the 
supervision of the teacher, but if more time is given to the 
assignment than to the review at the beginning of the semester, 
definite instruction in how to study may be given. This will 
do much to overcome wrong ways of working, which all too 
often are the result of home study. When the review indi- 
cates that a lesson has presented difficulties which have not 
been overcome by the majority of the class, omit the assign- 
ment planned, and devote the entire period to a How to Study 
lesson, teacher and pupils working together until the difficul- 
ties are removed. 
The pupils particularly enjoy the assignment notebook 
plan, because it is definite and helps them to do their work in 
a systematic way. Any teacher who has ever followed this 
plan with a class realizes its value.

How to Study Lesson 53 
The Review. — Subject Matter. The Egyptians, Chal- 
deans, Phoenicians, Hebrews and Persians, as early leaders of 
civilization. 
Method. A brief study of the papers written by the pupils 
during the study period of the previous day will no doubt reveal 
the fact that the majority of the class have failed to determine 
the most important facts. This is because they do not know 
how to study. It is, therefore, necessary to work with the class, 
and again go over the subject matter. Give them definite 
directions, which will constantly require the exercise of inde- 
pendent judgment. Impress upon them that they are looking 
for information which will help to solve their problem. They 
need help in knowing what facts are of value and what 
are unimportant. The following suggestions may prove 
helpful : 
1. Have the problem of the previous lesson restated and 
written upon the board. 
2. Call upon some of the brighter pupils to name the people 
who they found were among the early leaders of civilization. 
Have these names also written upon the board. 
3. Now call upon several whose papers indicated that they 
did not know how to select the facts from the text. 
4. Encourage these pupils to feel that they have not failed 
completely, but help them to realize that their knowledge is 
incomplete. 
5. Tell the class you are going to help them by showing them 
how to study the text. 
6. Have the pupils open the books at the index in the back 
of the book. Explain the purpose of the index, and show the 
class how to find any topic desired. Compare the index with 
the table of contents, and show why the former is more help- 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
54 Supervised Study in History 
ful. In all future study, insist upon the use of the index for 
finding a topic. 
7. Turn to the reference given in the index for the “ Chal- 
deans” (p. 8); call upon one of the brighter pupils to read 
the first paragraph aloud, and then re-read the most important 
sentence in the paragraph. Insist upon the reason for the 
decision. If an unimportant sentence is chosen, help the 
pupil to see why it is unimportant. 
8. Consult the map, p. 4, for the location of Chaldea; the 
Tigris and the Euphrates Rivers. 
g. Call upon other pupils to read the following paragraphs 
about the Chaldeans, helping them to keep constantly in mind 
the selection of the most valuable facts which relate to their 
problem. 
ro. Study the picture on p. 10 with the class, when the 
reference is found in the text. 
11. Call upon one of the weaker pupils to summarize the 
chief facts studied about the Chaldeans. Help him to recall 
these facts by questioning him, if necessary. 
12. Encourage the pupils to ask questions as they read; 
also urge them to make a note of any difficulty found during the 
silent study period, or to write a question about anything that 
is not clear. 
13. In the same way, continue to review the facts about the 
Pheenicians, Hebrews and Persians. 
14. Give special attention to words or sentences written in 
italics. 
15. Study carefully all maps and pictures. 
16. Follow any cross reference or note. 
17. Impress the pupils with the fact that studying is not 
merely reading a certain number of pages of any text. Avoid 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
  How to Study Lesson 55 
insisting upon too many facts. The purpose of these few 
lessons on the early leaders of civilization is merely to give the 
pupils the idea that American history has been influenced by 
the history of ancient times. 
The Assignment. —1. Information given by the teacher 
as an introduction to the future study of the Greeks. Greek 
stories recalled. 
2. Recognition of the new problem by the class. 
3. Definite directions for independent study. 
Information given by the Teacher. An interesting way to 
introduce the study of the Greeks is to have the pupils recall 
stories of Greece, read in previous grades, such as “‘ Jason and 
the Golden Fleece,” ‘‘ Odysseus,” “ The Siege of Troy,” etc. 
If any pupil remembers one of these stories, ask him to tell it 
briefly. If no one remembers any story, tell a story which 
will arouse interest. Write the names of other stories upon 
the board, and urge the pupils to secure them from the library. 
Follow the story with the location of Greece upon the wall 
maps, and give a few brief facts which will serve to create a 
desire to know more about the people of this country. 
Recognition of the New Problem.— If it is difficult at first to 
get a class to state the problem for study, do not waste time, 
but state the problem and thereby give them an idea which 
will control their studying. 
The Problem: How did the Greeks succeed the Persians 
in the civilization of ancient times? 
Directions for Study.— Require the pupils to read the direc- 
tions or questions for study. Then help them to find the ref- 
erences for each topic or question. As these are found, the 
number of the page should be written on the board after each 
topic. 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
  56 Supervised Study in History 
This will give them training in how to use a textbook. If 
it is impossible to have two or more sets of supplementary 
texts, attempt to plan the work for study so that the pupils 
may have a definite topic or question for which to look, in a 
single text. Avoid the old form of page assignment. It is 
not conducive to purposive thinking.

nitely whether the lesson has been planned within the ability
-P-A-G-E-73
  How’ to Study Lesson 57 
of the pupils to accomplish the work in the given time, it is 
necessary to have some check upon how much has been ac- 
complished by each pupil. The teacher has discovered the 
amount accomplished only by those with whom he has been 
working during the silent study period. 
A very easy way to determine how much each pupil has 
accomplished is to give each one a permanent number. At 
the close of the study period, ask all who were still working on 
or had finished only the first part of the assignment, or No. I, 
to stand and give their numbers. Each number can be quickly 
written down as itis given. A plus sign after a number might 
indicate that the pupil had completed that part of the assign- 
ment. In the same way, determine how many were working 
on, or had finished, No. II and No. III. 
In this way a teacher not only knows how many have com- 
pleted each part, but also the individual pupil in each group. 
Later in the term, when one is thoroughly familiar with the 
ability of each pupil, the total number in each group would be 
sufficient to prove whether the lesson was satisfactory, too 
difficult or too easy. Ifa very large number have not accom- 
plished the minimum assignment, it may be assumed that the 
lesson is too difficult, or too long. If the majority have reached 
the maximum, the lesson is too simple, or more could have 
been done by the superior group. A normal distribution in a 
class of thirty-five pupils might be: minimum, 5; average, 
24; maximum, 6. This is another way of determining who 
needs special attention during the review, the following day. 
Before dismissing the pupils urge them to look for pictures 
of Greek buildings as well as for books containing stories about 
the Greeks.

The Review. — Subject Matter. The Greeks. (See the 
problem and assignment for study in the previous lesson.) 
Method. The problem and plan for study of the previous 
lesson should be written upon the board in the same form as 
upon the preceding day, with the exception that the refer- 
ences should be omitted. Call upon a pupil who was work- 
ing in the minimum assignment to come to the front of the 
room, and give a complete recitation upon the first topic, — 
The Country of Greece, — using the map to illustrate when- 
ever necessary. Insist upon a brief, accurate account, with a 
statement concerning the source of information. If impor- 
tant facts are omitted or errors made, allow others to give cor- 
rections, ask questions for additional information, or add any 
valuable fact pertaining to the topic. Do not allow time 
to be spent upon unimportant details. 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
Deductive Lesson 59 
It is necessary to know how thoroughly those who reach the 
maximum assignment have prepared the minimum and average 
assignments. If the latter have been superficially studied, 
stop at this point, and strongly emphasize the disadvantages 
to the pupil in this kind of studying. Insist upon quality 
before quantity. 
Continue the review in this manner, calling upon the inferior 
pupil, as well as upon the average and superior. Send any 
pupil who is uncertain or confused back to the text to deter- 
mine the correct information. Give special emphasis to the 
more important topics, such as No. 4, under III. (See 
Lesson IV.) Note any points which need further drill or 
study. 
Conclude the review by adding a few facts to supplement 
the ideas already obtained, or by allowing any pupil who has 
read one of the Greek myths to tell the story to the class. 
The Assignment.—1. Lead the pupils to realize that they 
have not yet obtained sufficient data for the solution of their 
problem. 
2. Continue the study of the same problem by mentioning 
some of the important facts about which they must study 
before they can tell “‘ how the Greeks succeeded the Persians 
in the civilization of ancient times.” 
Tell the class that the people of any nation must be good 
citizens of their country before it can become a leader among 
other nations. Briefly discuss the meaning of citizenship here 
in America. Then read to the class the Athenian Oath, explain 
its meaning, and show the pupils that the Greek idea of citizen- 
ship is also our present idea of good citizenship. This will 
interest the class so that more information concerning the 
Greeks as citizens will be desired. 
 
-P-A-G-E-76

Study of the Assignment.— JI or Minimum Assignment. 
The Greeks as Citizens. (Insist upon pupils finding refer- 
ences as in previous lessons.)

ism with American people of to-day? Reference: Woodburn 
& Moran, p. 20. 
2. What was one privilege granted to Greek citizens and one 
duty required of them? Reference: Gordy, p. 43. 
3. What was the purpose of the Greek assembly? How did 
it differ from our law-making body? Reference: Gordy, pp.

4. Memorize the Athenian Oath. Reference: Wood- 
burn & Moran, p. 29. 
II or Average Assignment. The Training of the Boys and

5. Why did the Athenians and Spartans give so much atten- 
tion to the physical training of their boys? Reference: Gordy, 
pp. 38-41. 
III or Maximum Assignment. The Olympic Games. 
6. Read the reference in Gordy, pp. 41-42, and then write at 
the board a description of these games. 
Verification. — Read and discuss the paragraphs written 
upon the board ; also determine how many were working upon 
the different parts of the assignment. Save all pictures and 
supplementary material for a definite time, when special atten- 
tion may be given to them. Dismiss the class with one or two 
brief statements concerning something to which they may look 
forward. Give them an idea of what is in store for them; not 
a real picture, but simply a glimpse, — only enough to arouse 
their curiosity. 
For Whom Planned. — These five lessons, as previously stated,
-P-A-G-E-77
Deductive Lesson 61 
have been planned particularly for a Seven B Grade, which 
is just beginning the study of American history. The method, 
however, may easily be adapted to any grade. All grades 
would be greatly benefited at the beginning of a semester by a 
series of lessons on how to study. 
Since the first three units of instruction might be the 
amount required of a Seven B Grade within a period of twenty 
weeks, or one semester, more than one-third of the time could 
be spent upon the first unit. Progress in covering subject 
matter is necessarily slow at the beginning of the semester, 
until students have gained some power in right ways of 
thinking. 
General Statement concerning Future Lessons. — The 
purpose of these early lessons should be merely to give the 
pupils a very general glimpse of the lives of the people who 
directly or indirectly influenced the history of our country. 
Only a very few of the most important topics can be studied. 
A series of similar lessons should be planned, bearing upon 
Greek history, through the consideration of : 
1. The Greeks as artists and builders. 
2. The Greeks as writers. 
3. Great heroes or leaders of the Greeks. 
4. The Greeks as colonizers. 
5. The spread of Greek civilization. (Not more than 
four lessons.) 
In the same way a very general study of Roman his- 
tory should be made, with the purpose constantly in mind 
of giving the pupils a more definite understanding of the 
growth of civilization, and how a new nation is dependent 
upon the mother country for its civilization. (At least four 
lessons.)
-P-A-G-E-78
EE ERLE 
| 
| 
62 Supervised Study in History 
Following the study of the Romans, possibly three lessons 
should be given to show the influence of the Germans upon the 
early civilization of Europe. The study of the first unit of 
instruction may then be concluded with at least two lessons 
on the early history of England, in which only a brief glimpse 
should be given of such points as: 
King Alfred and the English. 
King Alfred and the Danes. 
English life under the Feudal System. _ 
This will lead to a study of the second unit of instruction, 
“ Events Leading to the Discovery of America.” 
Only a very general estimate of the number of lessons to be 
devoted to each division of a unit of instruction is attempted 
in this discussion. The number cannot be arbitrarily fixed, 
but must vary to meet the needs of the particular class receiv- 
ing instruction. 
A Red Letter Day might be provided for at the conclusion 
of the study of the Greeks and Romans, and again at the 
completion of the first unit of instruction. This is an oppor- 
tunity for a complete summary through the means of a Social- 
ized Recitation. One may provide for this days or even 
weeks in advance, and thus give the pupils something pleasur- 
able to anticipate. They readily appreciate the fact that a 
lesson of this character is an occasion for the contribution of 
items of special interest. A spirit of good-natured rivalry is 
thus developed with the result that children will do a vast 
amount of “ research” in order to be able to contribute valu- 
able information. There is no more delightful proof that our 
pupils are acquiring an interest in history than is demonstrated 
by the contribution of items pertinent to the question under 
consideration.

The Program. — Subject Matter. Any topics of importance 
or special interest studied under the first unit of instruction. 
Method.—How to Prepare the Program. ‘This type of 
lesson requires a longer period of time to prepare than any 
other. It is, therefore, the result of a series of lessons upon 
some question or division of history. The term Red Letter 
Lesson seems particularly applicable because of the vivid 
impression such lessons make upon the minds of the pupils. 
It is a day to which they have long looked forward. It has 
been frequently mentioned, and definite preparations have 
been made for it, during the study of the first unit of in- 
struction. The pupils’ anticipation of this day, together 
with their preparation, individually or in groups, makes the 
term Red Letter Lesson most appropriate. 
Such a lesson may be provided for in several ways. An 
ingenious teacher will find that it presents remarkable possibili- 
ties. The preparation of a special program, a debate, or 
the dramatization of some event in history, are three ways in 
which a lesson of this character might be conducted. In plan-
-P-A-G-E-80
I SSSSSS’'S'SSS Sr 
| 
| 
64 Supervised Study in History 
ning a Red Letter Lesson in the form of a delete program, the 
following suggestions may prove helpful: — 
The evaluation of the unit of instruction to be taught will 
determine the number of lessons necessary. This will enable 
a teacher to plan, from the first lesson on any unit of instruc- 
tion, a Red Letter Lesson to be given as a climax to the study 
of any particular unit. As the work progresses from day to 
day, good material in the form of special reports given by 
individual pupils, an especially good dissertation on any 
topic, valuable research work, —in fact, anything which will 
help to make an interesting program should be saved. This 
is an excellent incentive to the members of a class. They 
should be told why this material is worth saving. 
The first lesson of this type with a Seventh Grade needs very 
definite planning by the teacher. Allow the members of the 
class to assume just as much responsibility as practicable. 
This develops initiative. Encourage them to suggest topics 
which are interesting as well as instructive. A few days 
previous to the day upon which the lesson is to be given, the 
teacher should ascertain just what the class has to contribute. 
The members of the class might then be permitted to choose 
a committee which would work with the teacher in arranging a 
definite program. If the contributions made by the class are 
not broad enough to cover the essential points which need 
to be considered, other topics should be added and assigned to 
pupils who have not contributed. Allow only brief reports and 
insist upon accurate statement of facts. The source of infor- 
mation should be given by each child as he recites. Provide an 
opportunity for as many pupils as possible to have some part, 
however slight it may be, inthe program. Several pupils may 
be needed to recite upon one number on the program.  
-P-A-G-E-81
Review and “ Red Letter” Lesson 65 
Pupils of this grade should be given specific references 
for any extra research work required. Eighth grade or high 
school pupils should be encouraged to find their own material. 
A careful record of the source of information must be kept by 
each pupil, and any discussion resulting from statements con- 
sidered erroneous should be settled by having passages read 
from the books used as authorities. Always insist upon pupils 
being able to present satisfactory proof of their statements. 
It is only in this way that we can train pupils to be independent 
thinkers. An opinion is of little value unless one has a definite 
reason for having such an opinion. 
How to Conduct the Program. If possible, allow the class 
to invite the pupils of another class to share the program with 
them. Begin the lesson by permitting the class to elect a 
chairman. The chairman should then give to the visiting 
class a few brief statements concerning the lesson. He should 
have a copy of the program and announce each number. If 
the program is written on the blackboard the pupils may be 
even more interested. The following program is merely 
suggestive :

IV. Important facts about the people of ancient history. 
V. The Greeks — where they lived. (Blackboard or wall 
map.) VI. What the Greeks did for the extension of civilization. 
VII. Description of pictures of Greek life. 
VIII. Great leaders of the Greeks. 
(Several pupils called upon, each giving a different 
character.) 
IX. Great leaders of the Romans. 
X. Greek and Roman citizens. 
XI. Greece of ancient times compared with Greece of to-day. 
XII. How and why the Romans lost their power. 
XIII. The meaning of the period of history known as the Dark 
Ages. 
XIV. The influence of Roman civilization upon the history of 
England. 
XV. A list of books consulted during the study of the early 
leaders of civilization. 
XVI. Brief discussion and correction of any errors made during 
the program. 
These topics may seem rather difficult for a seventh grade. 
It must be kept in mind, however, that this does not require 
an exhaustive study of details. The strong impression of a 
few general facts is our chief concern here. The detailed study 
of ancient history will come later when the pupils are more 
capable of doing the kind of reasoning required. 
The thirty-minute study period preceding the program 
should be devoted to a general review of the facts to be con- 
sidered. After a few lessons of this kind, the planning of future 
lessons can be very largely intrusted to the pupils. 
Committees appointed by the class to prepare different 
parts of the program will prove to be very effective. It is 
 
-P-A-G-E-83

frequently most surprising to see the ability pupils show, if 
given an opportunity to assume responsibility.

Method. Since several lessons on the English have inter- 
vened, as well as a Red Letter Lesson for the purpose of sum- 
marizing the most important points under the first unit of 
instruction, the method for this review might well be in the 
form of reports upon topics pertaining to the subject matter 
mentioned above. These topics might be assigned to the class 
by rows, several days previous to the teaching of the lesson. 
Since this is a Seven B class, definite sources of information 
should be given to those directed to prepare each topic, if 
sources other than the text are available. 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
  68 Supervised Study in History 
Assign a different topic, if possible, to each row. Let each 
row then represent a team. Begin the review by permitting 
the class to nominate a presiding officer, who should then take 
charge of the review. Direct the time-keeper to divide the 
time for review among the rows. If there are five rows in the 
class, each row might be entitled to five minutes. 
The presiding officer now calls upon a pupil in the first 
row. ‘This pupil comes to the front of the room, and as briefly 
as possible gives the facts he considers most vital as a result 
of studying the topic assigned his row. If he is well prepared 
and is accurate in his statement of facts, he should be allowed 
the entire five minutes, if necessary. if the pupil first called 
upon is poorly prepared, or unable to make a satisfactory reci- 
tation, the presiding officer calls upon others in the same row 
to recite, until the time-keeper calls, “ Time.” In the same 
manner, each row should have an opportunity for a five-minute 
dissertation upon the topic assigned. Conclude this review 
by permitting the class to decide which team did the best 
work. 
This kind of work does not necessitate preparation outside 
of school. Pupils who are eager and able to do extra research 
work in home or public libraries should not be discouraged from 
doing so. The topics might be given as an average assignment 
at the time of the study of the Germans, and the period of 
history known as the “ Dark Ages.” The pupils will be eager 
to do supplementary reading when they know any pupil may 
be called upon to represent his “ team.” ‘ 
The Assignment.— 1. An exposition given by the teacher to 
help the pupils understand the length of time represented by 
the different periods of history. This is something that is 
difficult for young pupils to comprehend, and is, therefore, the   
      
  
 
-P-A-G-E-85
Expository Lesson 69 
occasion for an expository lesson. Future lessons will be 
better understood if the pupils are given an idea of the histori- 
cal setting and time of the great events to be studied. 
A very brief outline might be written on the board as the 
different periods are described. Allow the pupils to contrib- 
ute wherever possible. The expository lesson should briefly 
outline the following points : 
1. Ancient History. — Time, — about 5000 B.c. to 476 A. D. 
a. Eastern Nations — (Egypt, Chaldea, Persia, Phos- 
nicia). 
b. Greece. 
c. Rome. 
2. Medizval or Middle Ages. — Time, — 476 to 1492. 
a. Dark Ages — 476-800. 
b. Middle Ages Proper — 800-1300. 
c. Renaissance or Revival of Learning — 1300-1492. 
3. Modern History — 1492-1917. 
An expository lesson should be given by the teacher at such 
points throughout the course where pupils need help in linking 
up events. Otherwise their conception of history would be 
only a knowledge of isolated facts. It is very difficult to give 
pupils a definite idea of time. This might be made more vivid 
if each period of history were represented by drawing a line 
upon the blackboard in colored chalk. Such a line drawn in 
three colors, a color for each period, to the scale one inch = 
roo years, would show the proportionate length of time of 
each period. A larger scale would be more valuable if there 
is room. It must be one continuous line, however. Strips of 
colored paper might be used in the same way. The more 
diagrams and illustrations used in an expository lesson, the 
more vivid will be the impressions.

The review brought out the cause of the Dark Ages. The 
new problem before the class will now be: 
2. Problem: What was the great historical event of the 
Middle Ages?

above, the teacher might state the problem for the class.

a question, based upon the subject matter studied in the 
previous lesson. (See Lesson VII.) Encourage pupils to 
write questions upon points concerning which more informa- 
tion is desired. Each pupil should write his name on the back 
of the slip containing the question. 
These questions should be collected and re-distributed. 
Each pupil should then be given a number. A score-keeper 
and two judges should be selected by the teacher, or, better 
still, by the class. A chart similar to the following should 
be drawn on the board previous to the entrance of the class. 
(Allow the pupils to do just as much of this work as possible.) 
Many ways will suggest themselves to a teacher by which
-P-A-G-E-88

interest may be aroused and attention gained. No plan is too 
trivial to receive consideration.

  Numbers on the chart should be consecutive as high as 
there are members in the class. The score-keeper now takes 
his place at the board and calls a number. (Do not allow 
this pupil to call the numbers in order.) The pupil having the 
number called, rises and reads the question on the slip. 
The two judges previously selected act with the teacher 
in deciding whether or not the question is satisfactory. If 
accepted, the score-keeper writes “ Yes” in the second col- 
umn; if rejected, the judges tell why, each judge being given 
an opportunity upon a different question. The score-keeper 
writes “ No ” for all questions rejected. 
The pupil who reads the question now gives his source of 
information, which is recorded by the score-keeper, by giving 
the initials of author of texts, or abbreviations of other sources. 
The answer is given next, and if correct, the score-keeper 
checks by putting the “ plus” sign in the next column. If
-P-A-G-E-89
Deductive Lesson 7 
incorrect, the “zero” sign should be indicated in the same 
way. Any incorrect or incomplete answer should be recog- 
nized and corrected by the members of the class as described 
in previous lessons. 
Tn case similar questions are asked by several pupils, and are 
consequently rejected, an opportunity is given for the teacher 
to ask any vital questions which have not been brought out 
through the pupils’ questions. Work of this kind requires the 
teacher’s closest supervision. Pupils must not be allowed to 
waste time over trivial points. The constant attention of 
the teacher is required to control the work successfully. 
Advantages of this Form of Review. — It may not be out of 
place to remind the reader that reviews of this kind have cer- 
tain distinct advantages. 
1. The pupils are actually doing the work. 
2. The delegation of responsibility adds interest and secures 
attention. 
3. The provision for accuracy of question and answer gives 
pupils training in the value of correct work. 
4. The socializing influence resulting from pupils and 
teachers working together creates an ideal situation in a class- 
room. Slight occasion for formal discipline is necessary where 
a genuine interest has been aroused. 
5. The training given pupils, by which they learn to respect 
the opinion of others, is a valuable lesson in good citizenship. 
6. The Record Chart indicates where individual attention 
is needed during the study period. A question or statement 
given to a pupil whose question was rejected, or whose answer 
was incorrect, will help both pupil and teacher. 
The Assignment. — The study of the assignment in Les- 
son VII naturally results in the desire to know what effect the
-P-A-G-E-90
14 Supervised Study in History 
Crusades had upon the history of Europe, during the Middle 
Ages. A few brief statements by the teacher will lead the 
pupils to recognize their own problem, which should be stated 
very simply, viz. : 
Our Problem: What were the results of the Crusades? 
A few pupils may have gained some information upon this 
question during their study of the previous lesson. Permit 
such pupils to tell only enough to create among the others a 
desire to know more about this question. For those who 
already have some information, a question or two which will 
require further research will be sufficient to convince them 
that more study is necessary. |

III or Maximum Assignment. Questions prepared for 
to-morrow’s Review. 
Pupils completing I and IT may serve on a committee which 
will prepare the questions for the class. These pupils should 
be allowed to work together very quietly in one section of 
the room. The questions should aim to cover the important 
points in the lesson just studied. If a large number reach the 
maximum, two committees might be formed, — one to prepare 
the questions; the other, to judge of their worth. 
*” This kind of maximum assignment gives the pupils an op- 
portunity to work together in small groups, in attempting to 
apply immediately the ideas gained from the suggestions and 
corrections resulting from the work done in the review at the 
beginning of the period. 
A minimum of four lessons might be given on this second 
unit of instruction. A lesson should be given on Marco 
Polo’s? Travels and the Fall of Constantinople, with its 
results. Follow this by a final lesson in which the Renais- 
sance period should be made clear to the pupils. These les- 
sons will give the class sufficient background to begin te 
study of the discovery and exploration of America. 
Teachers should guard against the inclination to teach any 
of the topics mentioned in the first and second units in too 
great detail. Many events should purposely be omitted. It 
is not our purpose to teach Greek or Roman history at this

time. Neither is it our aim to teach all the great events of 
the Middle Ages; therefore, a discrimination must be made 
and only such facts taught as have a direct relation to Ameri- 
can history. The second unit of instruction may be regarded 
as a connecting link and so does not require the time that 
should be given to some of the others.

The Review. — Subject Matter. A brief summary of the 
events leading to the discovery of America. 
Method. A day or two previous to the teaching of this 
lesson, the pupils might be urged to submit any topics or 
questions relating to the second unit of instruction, which had 
presented any difficulties or concerning which more informa- 
tion might be desired. From these topics the teacher should 
prepare questions, adding or omitting any which prove to 
be unimportant. Ten questions will be sufficient, if care  
-P-A-G-E-93
Socialized Lesson 77 
is given to the thought required in answering each. The 
question to be read first should be numbered “One.” All 
others should contain no numbers. Special emphasis should 
be placed on questions pertaining to the trade routes controlled 
by Venice and Genoa before the capture of Constantinople, 
and the later demand for exploration. 
At the beginning of the period, the class should elect a 
judge and a member of the class to conduct the review. These 
pupils should be given seats in the front of the room facing the 
class. The slips containing the questions then may be given 
to the “‘ conductor.” Directions similar to the following are 
necessary : 
“The conductor may read the question numbered one. 
All who can answer it may quietly stand. The judge may call 
upon any pupil to recite; the others standing may be seated 
until this recitation is completed. If any then have fur- 
ther statements or questions, they may stand, and, after 
being given permission by the judge, may make additional 
statements or question the pupil first called upon. The 
conductor must make a careful study of all questions, and 
number each in the order in which he thinks they should 
be given.” 
Encourage the pupils to give additional facts in the form of 
definite references, or to express their opinions on any point, 
provided they can tell why they have such opinions. Any 
questions resulting in disagreement should be settled by the 
judge, if possible; or by the teacher. Insist upon accurate 
facts and proof of statements. Help the judge to check all 
questions which do not pertain directly to the topic under 
discussion. Pupils of this age need much training in keeping 
to the point.
-P-A-G-E-94
78 Supervised Study in History 
After the first question has been thoroughly discussed and 
satisfactorily settled, the conductor should read the question 
which he has decided should be the second one. This tests 
his knowledge of the order of the events reviewed. He has 
an opportunity to make these decisions while the pupils are 
discussing the previous question. The remaining questions 
should be treated in the same manner. It is also advisable 
to have a summary of each question made as a result of the 
discussions. Here again an opportunity is offered the judge 
to decide who gives the best summary. 
This is only one of a countless number of ways in which a 
review may be socialized. A slight variation made at any 
time, when occasion demands, helps to keep an element of 
“newness ” in the work. This makes the study of difficult 
topics seem “like a game” to the children. The results, 
however, of this work with a Seven B class may seem unfin- 
ished and crude, but it is a beginning, which, if followed in 
other grades, will have a deep influence upon the kind of think- 
ing done by the pupils. 
The Assignment.—r1. A brief explanation given by the 
teacher to show why little had been done in exploring the 
unknown ocean to the west and south of Europe. 
2. If the voyages of Diaz and Da Gama ! are unfamiliar to 
the class, these should be read or told, and the routes followed 
by each traced on a map. ‘The extent of the world actually 
known to the people of Europe should also be studied from 
maps. 
3. There will be many pupils in the class who can now tell 
that all this new interest in exploration concerns us directly 
because it led to the discovery of America. The voyages of

‘Columbus are also generally familiar as a result of stories 
read in the Fifth and Sixth Grades. Tell the class that there 
were voyages other than those made by Columbus, which 
must be considered in studying the discovery of America. 
This will lead to the recognition of : 
The Problem: Who besides Columbus were connected with 
the discovery of America, and in what way? 
A brief time should now be allowed for a rapid search 
in books especially selected for this lesson. As quickly 
as any pupil finds a reference that he is sure he can prove 
refers to any one connected with the discovery of America, 
he should rise and read the sentence containing the proof 
required. As each is found and accepted by the class and 
teacher, the names should be written upon the board in the 
following order : 
The Northmen, 
Columbus. 
The Cabots. 
Amerigo Vespucci. 
Study of the Assignment. — JI or Minimum Assignment. 
1. Read all references you can find about the Northmen, 
being able to tell: 
(a) Who they were. 
(b) Where they lived. 
(c) When they explored. 
(d) What they explored. 
(Any pupil who finds a good reference upon these topics 
may write the title of the book and number of the page upon 
the board after the topic.) 
2. During what period of European history did the North- 
men roam the seas north and west of Europe?

Source material selected from ‘Old South Leaflets,” 
Leaflet No. 31, — ‘‘ The Voyage to Vinland, from the Saga of 
Eric the Red.” 
If it is impossible to obtain these leaflets in volume form from 
the school or public libraries, single leaflets may be purchased 
for five cents a copy from the Directors of the Old South Work, 
Old South Meeting House, Boston, Mass. Even one or two 
leaflets could be utilized for this part of the assignment by 
allowing pupils to work together in groups of two or three. 
Reports might be given by these pupils as part of the review 
in the next lesson. 
III or Maximum Assignment. 
Read the poem “ The Skeleton in Armor,” by Henry Wads- 
worth Longfellow. 
A word or two of explanation concerning II and III before 
beginning to study will give the pupils an incentive to accom- 
plish more than the minimum. The pupils themselves may 
be of great help in providing enough copies of the poem, as| 
several may be able to bring copies from home. 
The value in the study of the above assignment does not li 
in the worth of the historical facts, but rather in the opportu
-P-A-G-E-97
  Socialized Lesson ae 
nity the subject matter affords to lead the pupils into therealms 
of the best literature. The facts gained from the study of the 
Old South Leaflet are in themselves of less value than the 
glimpse into accounts written in a style which differs greatly 
from that of the familiar textbook. 
We cannot hope to develop a love for history unless we 
skillfully pave the way by offering material of a similar char- 
acter, at such a time and in such a way as will make its greatest 
appeal to the pupil’s imagination. Experience has proved that 
children will gain a great deal from literature beyond their 
mental grasp, provided a keen interest has been aroused. 
Pupils of the Seventh Grade do not have the power to gain 
as much from this kind of assignment as older pupils, but 
even the little benefit derived is a step in the right direction. 
Verification. — In addition to checking the amount accom- 
plished by each during the study period, this time should afford 
an opportunity to encourage the class to bring in all pictures, 
maps, books, magazine articles or material in any form which 
may be discovered by the pupils as a result of the interest 
aroused through the preparation of such lessons as the above. 
A study of such material should be encouraged. The class- 
room thus becomes a place for the exhibition of collections 
which will be changed from time to time as the study of history 
progresses. Pupils to whom history has formerly been dry and 
uninteresting will discover that it is no longer merely a subject 
composed of an endless number of facts to be memorized. It 
has now become a subject filled with real, live problems and 
questions, the answers to which are found in many ways aside 
from a single textbook. 
Suggestions for Other Lessons upon the Discovery of 
America. — Much will depend upon the amount of information

the pupils have retained as a result of the stories read in pre- 
vious grades. If their knowledge of Columbus and his voy- 
ages is reliable, little time should be spent upon this topic. 
One lesson might be sufficient to review the most essential facts. 
If, however, the impressions are vague and inaccurate, time 
should be taken to fix the facts which are necessary for a thor- 
ough understanding of future lessons. The voyages of the 
Cabots and Amerigo Vespucci might be taught in one lesson. 
An interesting problem here might be :— Why was not Amer- 
ica named in honor of Columbus?

Method. An excellent way to summarize the facts taught 
in the lessons given on the discovery of America is through 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
  How to Study Lesson 83 
the making of maps. Each pupil should be required to pre- 
pare a map. It is not necessary that these should be made 
from memory. The outline of the western coast of Europe 
and the eastern coast of North America and South America 
might even be traced. In fact an accurate outline is highly 
desirable. The average pupil of the Seventh Grade usually 
finds difficulty in drawing free-hand maps. At best, many 
pupils would be able to produce only a very distorted repre- 
sentation, if free-hand maps were insisted upon. Outline maps 
purchased for such purposes, or those traced from a history or 
geography are much more valuable in a lesson of this kind. 
The advantage in this review is that the different routes 
followed by Columbus and others will be much more vividly 
impressed upon the memory if the hand and eye aid in 
making this mental picture. Free-hand maps defeat the 
purpose, as the images might be sadly inaccurate. If the out- 
line is accurate, pupils will find little difficulty in drawing, 
. free-hand, the routes followed by Columbus and others con- 
cerned in the discovery of America. 
Water colors or colored crayons are more satisfactory than 
ink or pencil drawings. Either ink or pencil, however, may 
be used to advantage, if the other materials are not available 
for each member of the class. ‘When completed, the maps 
should show the routes followed, the land discovered, and the 
year of each voyage across the Atlantic made by the North- 
men, Columbus, the Cabots, and Vespucci. 
If several pupils have the ability to draw accurate free-hand 
maps, they should be allowed to draw their maps upon the 
blackboard, with the understanding that the best map will 
be left for future reference. Here, again, colored crayons are of 
special advantage in representing the different voyages and the 
   
-P-A-G-E-100
  84 Supervised Study in History 
land discovered during each voyage. There is great pleasure 
and satisfaction in this work for any pupil who has special abil- 
ity. Italso gives the teacher an opportunity to recognize such 
ability. A pupil who may be a serious disciplinary case is 
frequently reached through the recognition of any successful 
effort. The wise teacher cleverly uses any such opportunity, 
and provides, as well, special situations where such pupils may 
be led to feel a personal responsibility toward the success of 
the lesson. The recognition by his classmates of the success 
of such a pupil is also an incentive to further effort. By work- 
ing with the class, during this time, the teacher may give val- 
uable assistance in correcting false impressions. 
The Assignment.—1. The new work now to be considered is 
the Exploration of America by European nations. A few 
questions will aid the class to recognize the fact that the 
voyages made by Columbus were the means of creating a 
desire for further exploration and discovery. 
2. A desire for further knowledge concerning the question 
of exploration may easily be obtained by reading brief extracts 
to the class. These should be selected because of their value 
in arousing interest. Accounts showing the high degree of 
civilization among the Incas of Peru, when conquered by 
Pizarro, or the Aztecs of Mexico, as related by Cortez, should 
furnish excellent material! Brief statements, picturing some 
of the conditions found in the New World by the early ex- 
plorers from Europe, are better for this purpose than accounts 
telling why Europeans were eager to explore. 
3. The pupils now will naturally be interested in finding 
out who explored the New World, and the reason for each 
1See Beard-Bagley, “‘The History of the American People,” Chaps. II, 
IU, Iv.
-P-A-G-E-101
  How to Study Lesson 85 
exploration. It will then be a simple matter to state the 
problem for study, viz. : 
The Problem: Why did European nations wish to explore 
and colonize the New World? 
The solution of this problem will require a series of lessons. 
This is frequently the case. It is not necessary to have a new 
problem for each lesson. Some problems may furnish the 
basis of study and research extending over a period of two 
weeks or even longer. 
Study of the Assignment.— I or Minimum Assignment.

lecting data and verifying the truth or accuracy of such data, 
as a part of the thinking employed in studying any problem.

The Review. — Subject Matter. Organization of the data 
collected during the study of the previous lesson : — the Span- 
ish, the French, the Dutch and the English Explorers. 
Method. During the verification at the close of the pre- 
ceding lesson, the class was made conscious that the solution 
of the problem had only just begun. The data collected is the 
first step toward a better understanding of the problem to be 
solved. It is now necessary to test such data in the light of the 
problem in order to determine whether any facts selected are 
irrelevant. This may be done through organizing the data 
collected.
-P-A-G-E-103
  How to Study and Deductive Lesson 87 
How to organize such data. The papers prepared by the 
class during the study of the preceding lesson should be 
returned to the pupils. The problem should be re-stated and 
written upon the blackboard. The teacher and pupils, work- 
ing together, should now arrange the data collected. The 
teacher may call upon members of the class to suggest the 
arrangement of this data. A brief examination of the pupils’ 
papers has enabled the teacher to determine who needs the 
most help, as well as who can give the best suggestions. The 
suggestions given should be accepted by the class. All who 
disagree or are uncertain are required to turn to the textbook 
for verification. As each point, proved to be correct, is ac- 
cepted, the teacher should include it in its proper place in the 
outline which he writes upon the board. 
Such work, done in a codperative way, greatly benefits each 
member of the class. It enables even the weakest pupil to 
make some contribution. It demonstrates the value of a 
careful consideration of all facts. It encourages pupils to be 
accurate and systematic, and affords an excellent opportunity 
for development of judgment through the rejection of all data 
found to be unrelated to the problem under consideration. The 
simple outline written on the board as a result of such codper- 
ative work should be copied by each pupil. A careful com- 
parison of his original paper with the finished outline should 
also be made. 
In work of this kind, teachers will find it helpful to em- 
phasize the fact that such an outline is far from complete, due 
to the fact that only a limited amount of material has been 
consulted in the collection of the data represented. Pupils 
need to be encouraged to report the names of other explorers 
if any are found when consulting other sources. Tell the class 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
eee ee a, 
88 Supervised Study in History 
that only the leading explorers can be studied because of the 
limited amount of time for the consideration of this question. 
Avoid complicated outlines containing many sub-headings. 
Seventh Grade pupils have not yet developed the power to 
recognize and appreciate the importance of the detailed divi- 
sions of a topic. Such an outline only defeats its purpose, as 
the pupils soon lose interest. ‘The work then becomes irksome 
and little benefit is derived from such effort. 
The Assignment. — Two things are important in this assign- 
ment, — the consideration of the element of time, and the 
necessity of having the class understand why the explorers 
representing each nation are to be studied in connection with 
the nation for whom each explored, rather than in chronologi- 
cal order. 
1. The Time Element. Unless special attention is given to 
this point, pupils gain very erroneous impressions concerning the 
time of the explorations made by Spain, France, England and 
Holland. It is difficult for them to understand that Spain, 
England and France were exploring different sections of the 
New World at approximately the same time (sixteenth cen- 
tury) while later in the seventeenth century, the French, English 
and Dutch made voyages of exploration to the New World 
within a year or two of one another. 
This point may be made clear, if special attention is called 
to such dates as the following:     
  
  
5355 Cartier — French. 
0-411. — De Soto — Spanish. 
1562. — The Huguenots — French. 
570-78. Frobisher and Gilbert — English. 
1577-80. — Drake — English. 
5504-85. -— Raleigh — English.
-P-A-G-E-105
How to Study and Deductive Lesson 89 
1607. — John Smith — English. 
1608. — Champlain — French. 
1609. — Hudson — Dutch. 
There is no necessity for pupils to memorize these dates 
at this time. They should be used merely to illustrate the 
point. This illustration also affords an opportunity for the 
teacher to explain why pupils will frequently find a disagree- 
ment among historians concerning these dates. This may aid 
in preventing pupils from losing faith in an author because 
such differences are found. 
2. The Order of Studying the Explorers. A brief explana- 
tion of the reason for studying the explorers according to the 
outline prepared during the review, will be sufficient for the 
class to realize the value of such outline work. The re-state- 
ment of the problem at this point will recall what must be 
considered in the study of the explorers for each nation.

Verification. — At the end of each lesson on the Spanish 
Explorers, the information found should aid the class to realize 
what has been accomplished toward the solution of the prob- 
lem, and that the problem will not be solved until all the 
explorers for each nation have been studied. 
The Lesson Type. — Teachers may have some difficulty, at 
first, to determine the type of lesson needed in teaching the 
subject matter suggested in the course of study. The par- 
ticular needs of the class, which become apparent as the work 
progresses, will be a great factor in aiding the teacher todeter- 
mine the kind of lesson most necessary from day to day. The 
subject matter under consideration also influences this 
selection. 
Such lessons as the above seem to have characteristics of 
 
-P-A-G-E-107
  How to Study and Deductive Lesson gr 
several types. This lesson might be called a Deductive Les- 
son, an Expository Lesson or “ How to Study” Lesson. 
When elements of several lesson types seem necessary, the 
mere fact that they are needed entirely justifies their use. 
In this case, a teacher might list each type; or classify the 
lesson by the type which seems to predominate. 
Suggestions for Further Study of this Unit of Instruction. — 
A series of lessons should now be given on the Spanish, French, 
Dutch and English Explorers. As much time should be 
devoted to each nation as seems to be necessary for a thorough 
understanding of the motives which led these nations to en- 
courage exploration and colonization. These facts may be 
summarized in one or two lessons upon the “ Claims of Euro- 
pean Nations in the New World.” ’ 
An entire period might well be spent, toward the close of 
the study of this unit, in comparing the motives influencing 
the explorers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries with 
those of explorers of the twentieth century. Magazine and 
newspaper articles will supply the most valuable data upon 
this question. 
A final Red Letter Day Lesson will conclude the study of 
the early exploration and colonization of America. This might 
be conducted by means of a debate upon such a question as the 
following : 
Resolved, That France had a stronger claim to territory in 
the New World than England. 
Allow the pupils just as much initiative in preparing and 
conducting this debate as practicable. 
If there is time, it may well be spent upon a careful study 
of the “ Natives of America and How They Lived.” The 
study of the Indians is always of great interest to every boy 
 
-P-A-G-E-108

and girl. The school or city library will supply abundant 
material for this study. Pictures and Indian relics brought to 
class and kept in the classroom during the study of this topic, 
stories portraying Indian life and adventure, simple dramatiza- 
tion of some Indian legend, visits to museums and places of 
local interest in connection with the Indians, and a final con- 
sideration of the Indians of to-day, are only a few brief sugges- 
tions concerning the possibilities of this topic. It is impor- 
tant, however, that pupils should have a thorough knowledge 
of this question in order to have a background of information 
upon which to begin the study of the period of colonization. 
This will then complete the three units of instruction sug- 
gested for the Seven B Grade. Although the units used as 
the basis for the type lessons outlined in this manual may not 
coincide with those required for the Seven B Grades in many 
school systems, it is to be hoped that the suggestions con- 
tained in these lessons may easily be applicable to the subject 
matter required in any course of study. It is not the purpose 
of this manual to outline a course of study. The lessons sub- 
mitted here merely offer suggestive methods of approach and 
procedure. Teachers are advised against following these 
suggestions arbitrarily. It is imperative that teachers adapt 
rather than adopt the methods suggested in these lessons to the 
needs and conditions peculiar to each grade or school.

CHAPTER FIVE 
THE EVALUATION OF THE COURSE OF STUDY FOR A 
SEVEN A GRADE 
How to Evaluate the Subject Matter.— For purposes of 
uniformity and systematic development of the lessons outlined 
in this manual, units of instruction I, II and III (pages 16-18) 
represent the material to receive consideration during a 
semester of twenty weeks, with pupils of a Seven B grade. 
In the same way units IV, V and VI may be designated as the 
portion of American history to be studied by pupils of a 
Seven A grade, during a period of equal duration. Approxi- 
mately three-fourths of the time might be devoted to unit IV 
and one-fourth to unit VI. Unit V needs very slight considera- 
tion, since it serves as a connecting link only. Possibly three 
or four lessons upon this unit will suffice to emphasize the most 
essential points to be kept in mind. 
Conditions Requiring Special Consideration. — In case a 
Seven A grade has had no instruction in supervised study, the 
suggestions and lessons outlined for the Seven B grade will 
be found very applicable. The organization of the class into 
inferior, average and superior groups is as essential here as 
in the previous grade. 
The “ Inspirational Preview’ (Lesson I), the lesson on 
“ How to use a Text Book ” (Lesson IT), as well as “‘ How to 
Study ” lessons, are all of vital need, regardless of the pre- 
vious methods ofinstruction. Pupils who have had the benefit 
95 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
96 Supervised Study in History 
of such methods, however, in the first half of the seventh year, 
show, by their readiness to go about the preparation of a lesson, 
the ability they have gained. A teacher needs no better 
proof of the real worth of such instruction than the evidence of 
this ability on the part of the individual pupil to do independ- 
ent thinking. 
The necessity of being an individual who both should and 
can serve his community, demands that training in the schools 
develop accurate, independent, broad-minded thinkers, — 
young men and women who are capable of assuming responsi- 
bility because they have been trained to realize the advantages 
to all concerned in careful investigation and thorough knowl- 
edge. The ability to meet new situations and to solve new prob- 
lems comes only through actual experience. Pupils must be 
given such training, therefore, as will help them to discriminate 
between occasions when quick decisions are necessary, and those 
which require careful deliberation and thorough investigation. 
Socialization of the work, evaluation of the course of study, 
careful investigation and systematic research in solving prob- 
lems, the suspension of judgment, consideration for the opinion 
of others, combined with the constant demand for initiative, are 
easily recognized as the best means to that one great end of all 
good teaching, — social efficiency and good citizenship. 
How to Review the Work of the Previous Grade. — It has 
long been the custom to spend the first week or more in review- 
ing the work taught in the previous grade. While there may 
be advantages in this plan, it lacks that element of newness 
which is such an important factor with children promoted to a 
higher grade. They are eager to experience new situations, 
and lose interest if the new work is delayed toolong. Teachers} 
may always expect to find that many of the facts previously
-P-A-G-E-113
  Evaluation of Course of Study for Seven A Grade 97 
taught have been forgotten by the pupils. If it becomes 
apparent that they are unable to understand any part 
of the new work because of failure to recall the facts taught 
in the preceding grade, delay the new work at this point and 
review the old. It seems wise to review in this way because 
an actual need has been created. Unless the previous work 
has been far from successfully done, no more time should be 
required to review in this way than to give a prolonged review 
at the beginning of the semester. 
Character of the New Subject Matter. — During the early 
part of the work with a Seven A Grade, a study should be made 
of the conditions existing in England which influenced the 
colonization of America. For the same reason that the actual 
study of the discovery and exploration of America was pre- 
ceded by a general study of European history, time now must 
be devoted to a consideration of certain aspects of English 
history. An intelligent study of the period of colonization can 
be made only after a thorough understanding of how closely 
the lives of those colonists were interwoven with and influ- 
enced by affairs in England, — affairs which had demanded the 
attention of their forefathers and were later of vital concern 
to all Englishmen, whether in an English colony in America, 
or in the mother country. The reasons for English colonies 
being founded in America and for these colonies later taking 
steps toward self-government, all had their origin in the rights 
and privileges gained by the English people in England. A 
consideration, therefore, of such points as are outlined under 
unit of instruction IV becomes imperative at this time. 
The point constantly kept before the minds of Seven B 
pupils was the Development of Civilization. We now need to 
emphasize as strongly the Development of Democratic Government.

The Review. — Subject Matter. Facts mentioned in the 
preview of the Seven A Course. 
Method. The plan outlined for the review in Lesson II 
might be advantageous for reasons given in that lesson. Much 
will depend upon the methods of instruction in the Seven B 
Grade. If methods of supervised study have been employed, 
a modification of the method of questioning might be advisable. 
Pupils have developed some power to question one another 
as well as to do independent thinking. 
Questions should previously be prepared by the teacher. 
Twelve or fifteen of these might be sufficient. They should 
be numbered consecutively from one to twelve, or from one 
to fifteen, as the case may be. Distribute these questions so 
that every other child has one. Assign a number to each mem- 
ber of the class. Now give the following directions:
-P-A-G-E-115
  Inductive Lesson 99 
“The pupil having Question No. 1 may stand, face the 
class, read the question distinctly, and call any even number 
(not to exceed the highest even number in the class). The 
pupil whose number is called will be required to answer this 
question. If this answer is inaccurate or incomplete, all 
pupils having even numbers who wish to add a statement, 
make a correction, or question the pupil having recited, may 
stand. Each must be recognized in turn by the pupil having 
Question No. 1. Question No. 2 must be read immediately 
at the close of the discussion of No. 1. This pupil may 
proceed in the same way, calling on those having odd numbers. 
All pupils having odd numbers then have the same opportunity 
for correction and discussion as those who were responsible for 
Question No. 1. Failure by either side to correct a point will 
be referred by the teacher to a pupil of the opposite side.” 
The questions should aim to recall the important points 
given in the preview. Emphasize the need for a considera- 
tion of certain events in English history. This is important 
from the beginning. 
The Assignment.— 1. Explanation and information given 
by the teacher. 
2. Recognition of the problem. 
Explanation given by teacher. 
The teacher should give an account of the many rights and 
privileges which originally came to us from England. Such 
points as our language, some of the ideas and customs, and 
particularly many things enjoyed under our form of government, 
should be explained. Tell the class that the right of trial by 
jury, as well as the forms of government in our villages, towns 
and counties, were brought here by the English. Show how 
our Congress resembles the British Parliament. Pupils will 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  100 Supervised Study in History 
readily understand that this is because the great majority 
of permanent colonies along the Atlantic coast were English 
colonies. Now question the class to see if they understand 
that England has a monarchial form of government, while the 
United States isa Democracy. Explain the difference between 
an Absolute Monarchy and a Limited Monarchy, and show 
the similarity between a Limited Monarchy and a Democracy. 
A few brief statements concerning the revolution of the 
English colonists will cause the pupils to begin to ask from 
whom the colonists first obtained their determination to havea 
voice in the management of their affairs. By means of citing 
events in English history, prove to the class that this spirit of 
freedom was developed from the English themselves. 
Recognition of the problem. As a result of the information 
and explanation given above, the pupils will be led to ask 
the natural question. 
How did the English people obtain their liberties? This 
should become the problem for consideration. Tell the pupils 
at this point that in order to understand this problem it will 
be necessary to study certain events in English history. The 
later study of the English colonies in America will be more 
intelligible to the pupils because of this insight into conditions 
formerly existing in England.

1. Read carefully all information given on pages 1-8! in

Verification. — Determine the number working on each part 
of the assignment ; collect all papers written during the study 
period ; and, if possible, read a few of the accounts which 
were written on the board. These statements should be read 
by the teacher, in any case, before they are erased. They 
will enable him to determine what background the pupils 
have upon which to begin, in the next lesson, the study of 
how the English people gained their liberties. 
It does not seem wise to have the pupils begin the study of 
any topic of English history in this lesson. A detailed study 
of English history is neither desirable nor practicable at this 
time. Only those events should be studied which portray con- 
ditions in England during the period when the people were 
struggling to secure the recognition of their rights. Some ex- 
planation is necessary, however, before pupils begin this study. 
The proper background for the study of the problem dis- 
covered in this lesson may be supplied if it is followed directly 
by an expository lesson in which the teacher relates some of 
the great facts of English history.

The Review. — Subject Matter. The ideas developed in the 
previous lesson. (See Lesson XII.) 
Method. The teacher’s chief aim in the previous lesson 
was to lead the pupils to realize that the people who came to 
America from England during the period of colonization were 
thoroughly English in their ideas and customs here in the new 
world. The one great fact to impress upon the minds of the 
pupils is that the determination to have certain rights and 
privileges began and developed in England several centuries 
before such rights were demanded by the English colonists in 
America. 
The chief purpose, therefore, of the review in this lesson 
is to determine how thoroughly this point was impressed, and 
to give it further emphasis, if necessary. This may be done 
by summarizing the points explained in the previous lesson. 
Call upon different pupils to state what each considers the 
most important facts to remember. Write these upon the 
board as they are given. If the fact desired by the teacher is
-P-A-G-E-119
Expository Lesson 103 
not given, question the pupils in order to help them state it. 
Now ask the class to consider the statements on the board, 
and decide which one is the most important of all. Deter- 
mine the decision by asking all who selected the first to stand. 
The second, third, fourth, etc. should be checked in the same 
way. If any impression has been made in the previous lesson, 
the majority of the class will find no difficulty in selecting the 
correct statement, which might now be written on the board 
in colored crayon. Those who failed to realize its importance 
should be questioned and helped later by the teacher during 
the study period. 
The Assignment. — 1. An exposition given by the teacher. 
2. A restatement of the problem by the class. 
3- Specific information necessary to understand the subject 
matter to be studied. 
The Exposition given by the Teacher. The few accounts 
written upon the board, by pupils completing the maximum 
part of the assignment in the previous lesson, have given the 
teacher an insight into the kind of information certain oneshave 
concerning events in English history. This knowledge will aid 
in giving the class a picture of some of the things that influenced 
the development of the people before the time of William the 
Conqueror. 
Tell the class that their study will begin with the conquest 
of England by William, Duke of Normandy. They must 
first, however, know something of the general history of Eng- 
land previous to that time. All children love a good story. 
No topics offer better material for a story than the ancient 
Britons; the Roman conquest; the invasion of such German 
tribes as the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes ; the coming of Christian 
missionaries, and the things accomplished by Alfred the Great. 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  104 Supervised Study in History 
As the story progresses, strongly emphasize the effect upon 
the native Britons of these invasions; show how the civiliza- 
tion of the England of to-day has been influenced through the 
various stages of her development. It is not so much the 
events described, which a teacher should aim to have pupils 
remember, as it is the great facts resulting from these 
events. 
Constant reference to maps, pictures and books should be 
made during this exposition. The teacher who wishes to 
encourage and develop a love for collateral reading among his 
pupils will, previous to this lesson, select as many books as 
can be obtained, which give in detail the events briefly men- 
tioned in the exposition. At the close of this part of the lesson, 
call the attention of the class to these books by showing each 
book, giving the title and telling what it contains which will 
be of particular interest to the class. The privilege of taking 
these books home should be extended, in turn, to all who desire 
to read them. If a careful and wise selection is made, a 
teacher will find difficulty in supplying the demand. En- 
courage all pupils who do outside reading to keep a record of 
the books read, together with the number of pages or chapters, 
and the topic or topics read. If this is required as part of 
the history work from the beginning of the semester, it will 
be surprising what a wealth of reading will have been done by 
the end of the term. 
The Restatement of the Problem. Call upon several pupils 
to state the problem decided upon yesterday. Write this 
upon the board. Then ask certain pupils to tell how the 
facts they have just heard have helped them. Aid them to 
see that it has prepared them for the consideration of the 
problem to be solved.
-P-A-G-E-121
Expository Lesson 105 
Specific Information Necessary to Understand the Subject 
Matter to be Studied. Explain the reason why it is necessary 
to begin the study of English history with the Norman con- 
quest. If it is difficult to find textbooks that explain this fact, 
simply tell the class that our chief reason for studying about 
William the Conqueror is because he granted a charter to the 
people of London when they did not resist him. This charter 
gave them the same rights and privileges which they had 
enjoyed under the reign of Edward the Confessor. Tell the 
class that the reason this fact is so important is because it 
marks the beginning of the recognition of the rights and 
privileges of the people of England.

Suggestions for Further Lessons upon “ How the English 
People Gained their Liberties.” *— Following the suggestions 
in Lessons XII and XIII, as well as those outlined for the 
Seven B Grade, a series of lessons should be given upon such 
events in English history as will help to prove How the Eng- 
lish people gained their liberties. (See topics mentioned under 
unit of instruction IV.) Such topics as the Magna Charta; 
the First Representative Parliament; the Regular Parlia- 
ment; the Petition of Rights; and the Bill of Rights need 
special consideration. Show their connection with the history 
of the English colonists. Later, during the study of the thir- 
teen colonies, constant reference should be made to these topics. 
1 Miss Atkinson, in her book mentioned above, gives at the end of each 
chapter excellent lists of references. These furnish a wealth of suggestion for 
collateral reading. 
2 For the purpose of showing a greater degree of difficulty in all subsequent 
lessons, it will be assumed that the pupils have been instructed according to 
methods of supervised study.
-P-A-G-E-123
  Expository Lesson 107 
Access to any helpful source material needs to be encouraged 
at all times. Pupils who have the opportunity to obtain infor- 
mation from any source outside of school should be recognized 
by being allowed to report occasionally to the class. A portion 
of the time for the review should be used, at stated intervals, 
for this purpose. 
It is not necessary, however, to make an attempt to have 
the pupils report upon all collateral reading. Much of this 
should be done for the purpose of the real enjoyment which 
children derive from the development of a habit of reading. 
The facts themselves will not all be remembered, but the 
impressions and ideas resulting from such reading are of 
greater value than all the facts. The ability to turn to a 
certain author, when information on a topic is needed, and 
the power to gain from the printed page'the facts and ideas 
expressed there, show real development. 
It will be helpful if pupils are urged to watch for and make 
a note of any accounts in their reading which explain why 
Englishmen left England.1 If pupils are directed to watch for 
this long enough in advance, they will have many reasons 
worth considering later. This will make an excellent ques- 
tion when summarizing How the English people gained their 
liberties. 
Factors Needing Consideration in Giving an Expository 
Lesson. — This type of lesson should be used very infre- 
quently. Its purpose is only to connect events which pupils 
cannot take time to study in detail, or to give such informa- 
tion as might require unnecessary research on the part of 
the pupils. The frequent employment of such lessons, how- 
ever, would weaken rather than strengthen the pupils. 
1 See Beard-Bagley, “The History of the American People,” Chaps. III, IV. 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
  108 Supervised Study in History 
Long and unnecessary detail should always be avoided. A 
recital of too many facts is also a serious disadvantage. 
Pupils are not able to retain these long lists of facts, and become 
confused and uncertain when called upon to repeat them. If, 
however, only brief statements are made, and such as are of 
vital importance, many points which might not be clear or 
from which pupils seem unable to draw the right conclusions, 
will be strengthened in this way.

The Review. — Subject Matter. A summary of the events 
studied in solving the problem: 
How did the English people gain their liberties? 
Method. The problem under consideration should be 
restated and written upon the board. Now proceed to 
summarize all information studied which had any bearing 
upon the problem. Call upon the pupils to name in order
-P-A-G-E-125
Habituation Lesson I09 
the events studied. Write these upon the board as each is 
given. Now ask the pupils to give only very brief statements 
to prove how each was a step toward self-government. Ap- 
point a pupil to find and report upon the meaning of “ self- 
government.” Avoid long accounts of the reign of William 
the Conqueror, King John, etc. Determine, instead, how 
well the pupils understand the benefits gained through the 
study of the Magna Charta, the Petition of Rights, etc. 
Insist upon proof of statements made by requiring pupils to 
tell the source of their information. Encourage them to read 
aloud to the class brief passages as proof of their statements. 
Ten or fifteen minutes devoted to a brief summary of this 
character will be sufficient. Since each topic should be thor- 
oughly reviewed before beginning the next one, a long, 
detailed review at this time is unnecessary. 
It is well worth while, however, to give the class an entirely 
different view of some of the same facts. This may be done 
by asking the pupils to give any statement discovered which 
will help prove Why Englishmen left England. (See suggestion, 
pages 106-107.) Again write these upon the board as each is 
suggested. Insist upon references being given and statements 
read as suggested above. 
Constantly ask the pupils such questions as “ What does 
it mean?” and “Is it true?” Allow pupils to have books 
open upon the desk and refer to them at any time during this 
part of the work. Emphasize the fact that the Petition of 
Rights was not gained until 1628. (Compare this with 1607, 
1614, 1620, 1630.) 
Conclude the review by determining how many of the pupils 
think they have discovered and tested sufficient data to feel 
that they have solved the problem. Any who wish further in-
-P-A-G-E-126

formation upon the question should be directed where and 
how to investigate further. 
A study of How the English people gained their liberties, 
together with noting other reasons, as the study continues, 
has thrown much light upon Why Englishmen left England. 
This point should be made very clear to the pupils before they 
begin the detailed study of the English colonies in America. 
The Assignment. — A Study of the Charter of 1606. Se- 
cure a copy of the Charter of 1606.1 The pupils will be 
greatly interested in this because of their previous study of 
English history. Tell the class that this is a copy of the 
charter granted by King James I in 1606. Explain that this 
document gave the English people the right to settle in 
America. Ask how many would care to hear certain parts of 
this read. 
The teacher should now read several sentences, — enough 
to show the pupils the peculiar style ; then stop, question them 
about the meaning, explain difficult words, and allow the 
pupils to question. In this way continue to read such sen- 
tences or passages as are necessary to give the pupils a clear 
idea of the London and the Plymouth Companies, and the 
land to be controlled by each company. 
Teachers who are inclined to doubt the advisability of 
presenting such material to seventh grade pupils, would be 
thoroughly convinced if it should be their good fortune to see 
Professor Johnson ? teach this subject matter to seventh grade 
boys and girls. Those who have witnessed his success in so

2 The value of using this material is explained by Professor Henry Johnson 
in his book “Teaching of History,” The Macmillan Co. To him the author 
is deeply indebted for this and other ideas embodied in the suggestions for

ably presenting such material, become filled with enthusiasm 
and a strong determination to attempt such work in their own 
classrooms. 
Before the study of the contents of the charter progresses, 
three pupils who do accurate work might be selected. These 
pupils should write on the board any facts considered neces- 
sary for the making of a map to illustrate the portion of land 
granted to each company. Conclude the assignment by 
checking the work written upon the board. Add to, or correct, 
any facts needed for reference in making the map. Question 
the pupils to determine how they are going to work to draw 
this map. 
The Study of the Assignment. — (Written work.) 
I or Minimum Assignment. 
1. By consulting your geographies and referring to the facts 
outlined on the board, draw a free-hand map of the eastern 
coast of the United States, and represent the following : 
(a) The land to be controlled by the London and the 
Plymouth Companies. 
(b) The land open to joint occupation. 
(c) Indicate the distance from the coast to be controlled 
by each company. 
IT or Average Assignment. 
2. Why did the King name these companies the London and 
the Plymouth Companies? 
3. Give the title, name of the author, and the reference to 
the exact page of any books in which you can find reasons 
why King James was eager to establish permanent English 
lessons on the colonization of America. A careful study of pp. 263-268 of the 
text mentioned above will give a wealth of suggestion for the development of 
this work.

colonies in America. Read each reference carefully before 
noting it. (Caution pupils against deciding upon the worth 
of a paragraph by considering its heading only.) 
III or Maximum Assignment. (Review work.) 
4. What Englishman had previously attempted to plant 
colonies in the territory now claimed by the London Company ? 
5. Briefly tell about the fate of these colonies. 
Verification. — During the study period the teacher has an 
opportunity to pass from desk to desk, and prevent serious 
erroneous impressions by questioning any pupil who has 
failed to comprehend the points discussed during the assign- 
ment. A few questions are far more valuable in setting a 
pupil right than the same amount of time devoted to giving 
this pupil direct information. Pupils will develop the power 
to do independent thinking only when the training is of the 
character to produce independent thinkers. All papers should 
be collected and inspected by the teacher in order that he 
may be able to select the best, as well as the ones which con- 
tain the most glaring errors. These papers should be made 
the basis of the review for the next day. ,

The Review. — Subject Maiter. A discussion of the 
facts represented by the maps drawn during the previous 
lesson. 
Method. Select the most accurate maps, show them to 
the class and aid the pupils to recognize the good points 
about each one. Then select several maps representing aver- 
age ability, and call upon the pupils to whom they belong 
for ways in which each could be improved. Leave those 
which show least accuracy until the study period. A word 
or two with such pupils in an undertone aids the teacher to 
determine whether the pupil is entirely at sea, or lacks the 
power to represent graphically facts which are clearly under 
stood. These pupils are thus saved from embarrassment and 
discouragement when the other maps are exhibited and dis- 
cussed. Permit the class to judge whether the better ones 
I
-P-A-G-E-130
II4 Supervised Study in History 
should be placed in the group of “ excellent ” maps, or the 
group of “ fair” ones. (Exceedingly poor maps should not 
be exhibited. More help can be given such pupils as sug- 
gested above.) 
Now allow the class to elect two pupils from among those 
whose maps were judged to be “ excellent.” These pupils 
have the responsibility of drawing a large map on the board, 
with colored crayon. This map may be left upon the board 
and used for reference during the study of the Virginia one 
the Plymouth colonies. 
It means more to the pupils elected, and to the class asa 
whole, to have this decision come from the class rather than from 
the teacher. Teachers who have never attempted this need 
have no fear that the pupils will be unfair or inconsiderate, 
if given the opportunity to decide some of these things for 
themselves. If the policy in the classroom is that of coépera- 
tion, the pupils will quickly come to realize this fact. They 
are willing and proud to recognize their leaders in any line 
of endeavor. This places an added responsibility upon the 
leaders themselves, who are ‘only too anxious, in order to 
please the class, to devote any ‘amount of time and energy 
to the piece of work they have been delegated to do. To the 
extent to which teachers appreciate the need for such develop- 
ment and provide occasions for the exercise of initiative, 
pupils will always measure up to the faith shown in their 
ability. 
Conclude the review by calling upon several pupils to sum- 
marize the important facts gained from the study of the 
Charter of 1606. This summary may be given by permittin, 
as many pupils as possible to contribute a statement, in th 
time remaining for the review.
-P-A-G-E-131
  An Appreciation and Habituation Lesson TI5 
The Assignment. — 1. The recognition of the new problem. 
2. Instruction in how to judge the worth of statements found 
in the text. 
The recognition of the new problem. Allow the pupils to 
suggest questions which they consider worthy of investi- 
gation in studying the English colonies in America. Such 
questions as the following will no doubt be suggested : 
Where were colonies planted ? 
Who founded each colony? 
What was the object of the colony? 
What happened in each colony? 
Write these on the board; then consider, with the class, the 
broadness of each one. Tell the pupils that we want to select a 
question which will meet the needs found in the study of each 
colony. Through suggestions and questions, help the class 
| to combine their questions into one similar to the following : 
“Where did the English colonists settle in America and 
how did they live?”? This may now become the new problem 
for consideration. 
Instruction in how to judge the worth of statements found 
in the text. Using Mowry’s “ Essentials of United States 
History,” as an illustration, have the pupils consult the index 
for the page reference to the London company (page 27). 
Direct them to read the title of the chapter, then the heading 
of the first paragraph. Now have them read paragraph 27 
silently, and select any statement which does not agree with 
facts found yesterday in the Charter itself. Have these 
statements read aloud, if any are found, and by explanation 
and questions help the pupils to recognize and appreciate the 
difference between the two. The map on page 27 should be 
included in this study also. 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
a aa | 
116 Supervised Study in History 
Now proceed to read the next paragraph. Ask what one 
might expect the paragraph to tell, judging from the heading. 
Have this paragraph read aloud, a sentence at a time, and 
discuss the meaning of each one. Explain the meaning of the 
quotation marks found so frequently on these pages. The 
pupils will be interested to know that the sentence quoted, 
“Youmust observe, if you can, whether the river on which you 
plant doth spring out of the mountains or of lakes,” etc., is 
quoted from the paper of instructions prepared by Hakluyt for 
the information of the officers upon landing. Any pupil who 
is interested in reading more about these instructions should 
be told to read “ Old Virginia and Her Neighbours,’”’ Volume 
I, by John Fiske! (pp. 71-79). Another pupil might be re- 
ferred to the same volume for information about Richard 
Hakluyt (p. 41-50). This should not be read at this time, 
but later during the maximum assignment, or outside of 
school. 
Show the class that it is impossible always to look up the 
sources of all these quotations. Much benefit will be derived, 
however, if pupils are made conscious of the fact that there 
are many sources consulted by writers of histories. Few 
pupils who study history realize this fact, unless it is brought 
to their attention in such a way. 
Only the two paragraphs (27-28) should be attempted 
during the brief time allotted. Ask some pupil to state the 
reasons given in paragraph 28 for sending colonies to America. 
Call upon another pupil to read only the sentence which tells 
about the main purpose of the companies. Direct the atten- 
tion of the class to the footnote on page 29. Ask a pupil to 
explain the advantage of such notes to the reader. Many

other directions might be given. These indicate only the 
general method of procedure. 
Study of the Assignment.—I or Minimum Assignment. 
1. Find the following facts about the colony founded by 
the London Company in America: 
(a) The extent of the land called Virginia. 
(0) The number and character of the settlers. 
(c) The location and name of the first settlement. 
(d) The difficulties encountered. 
(e) The service rendered the colony by John Smith, one of 
the Council. 
IT or Average Assignment. 
2. Write an account of the Jamestown colony. Tell only 
such facts as you consider the most important of those studied 
thus far. 
3. Why do we begin the study of the English colonies in 
America with the study of Jamestown? 
III or Maximum Assignment. 
Many interesting accounts may be found about the Virginia 
colony in the source books upon the table. Read as much 
as you can from any book in the following list :1 
Elson, “ History of the United States” (Macmillan Co.), 
Vol. I, beginning at p. 60. 
Southworth, ‘Builders of our Country” (Appleton), 
Book I, beginning at p. 73. 
Fiske, “Old Virginia and her Neighbours” (Houghton 
Mifflin Co.), Vol. I, beginning at p. 80. 
1Teachers are strongly urged to use their own initiative in selecting material 
for collateral reading. The books used as reference in any of the lessons out- 
lined in this manual are for illustrative purposes only. This has been done in 
the hope of demonstrating some of the advantages which will be derived by 
pupils when teachers avoid a rigid adherence to a single text.
-P-A-G-E-134
  118 Supervised Study in History 
Hart, “Source Readers in American History” (Macmil- 
lan Co.), Vol. I, beginning at p. 98. 
Higginson, “A Book of American Explorers’? (Longmans, 
Green & Co.), beginning at p. 231. 
Old South Leaflet No. 122, Richard Hakluyt, ‘“ Eng- 
land’s Title to North America,” from “ Discourses concerning 
Western Planting.” 
Old South Leaflet No. 167, “Captain John Smith’s 
Account of the Settlement of Jamestown.” 
How to Encourage Collateral Reading. — Experience has 
proved that the following plan will be most beneficial in pro- 
viding a situation which will result in habit formation : 
Secure as large a table as available space in the room will 
permit. Place this either in the front or the rear of the room, 
as far away from the class as possible, and arrange as many 
chairs around it as can be accommodated. This may now 
be used as a reading table, and should contain such material 
as will be most beneficial to the pupils during the study of any 
topic or problem. 
Pupils should be given the privilege of coming to this table 
and reading any of the books placed there, at any time which 
will not interfere with their other duties.. The study period, 
however, should be the chief occasion for this work. No better 
provision for a maximum assignment could be made than to 
allow any pupil who succeeds in preparing the minimum and 
average assignments, the privilege of amplifying his impres- 
sions through such a means. 
Teachers will find that pupils will eagerly grasp such an 
opportunity. They will be anxious to come early in the 
morning and return early at noon, or ask to take books home 
in order to read some author they have found especially inter-
-P-A-G-E-135
  An Appreciation and Habituation Lesson 119 
esting. Insist at all times that all other work required must 
be well done before the privilege of having access to this 
material can be granted. Unless this is made very emphatic, 
pupils will obtain only a’ superficial knowledge of the lesson 
assigned in their eagerness to go to the table and read a favor- 
ite book. This work may easily be controlled, however, and 
the incentive will, if properly managed, aid in securing better 
results in all lines of endeavor. 
The books suggested in the maximum assignment of Lesson 
XV are only suggestive of one kind of material which may be 
used for collateral reading. Extensive work of this character 
will become very well developed in the Eighth Grade and high 
school, if begun in the Seven A Grade. Such references as 
Fiske and Higginson may be considered more fitting for older 
pupils. Children of this age, however, also enjoy working upon 
something difficult, and if enough other material is supplied, 
no harm is done by placing such material within their reach. 
Encourage pupils to bring from home or the public library 
books which they have found helpful. They often make 
some very valuable contributions in this way, and it serves 
to keep them alert and conscious of the need for research con- 
cerning the topics under discussion. Pupils who make such 
contributions should be taught to mark the pages found most 
helpful, by inserting small slips of paper. Individual records 
of the books consulted in this way will prove at the end of the 
semester the value of such a plan. This work will be much 
more effective if it is made possible for teachers to have several 
copies (at least three) of the same book upon the reading 
table. Money spent in this way is well spent. 
Frequent changes should be made in this material as the 
needs of the class change. It may be entirely source material     
    
 
-P-A-G-E-136
120 Supervised Study in History 
at one time; magazines and newspaper clippings may replace 
this material; while standard works of our great authors and 
poets may later be introduced to the class. An enthusiastic 
teacher will find many ways to make this part of the child’s 
instruction particularly interesting and helpful to him. If 
such collateral material is briefly noted by the teacher in the 
course of study, opposite the topic for which it is selected, 
much time and effort will be saved in determining suitable 
material to be used with this and other classes. 
Suggestions for Further Lessons upon “ The English Col- 
onies in America.” — Following the suggestions given in 
Lessons XIV and XV, a detailed study should be made of at 
least four colonies. Virginia, Massachusetts, New York and 
Pennsylvania might be selected as types. Provision for col- 
lateral reading should be made in as extensive a way as the 
ability of the pupils and time will permit. A Socialized Reci- 
tation at the end of the study of each colony would give the 
pupils an opportunity to review each, as well as to make use 
of much of the information gained through their collateral 
reading. 
A general study of the purpose of the settlement of the 
other original thirteen colonies, together with any event which 
particularly influenced the development of all the colonies, 
should follow the study of the four selected as types. Possibly 
one lesson would suffice to give the class an understanding of 
The Government of the Colonies by England. (See unit of 
instruction IV, 3.) This should be done by means of an 
Expository Lesson. An opportunity should be provided in 
the study period for the pupils to determine the form of govern- 
ment existing in each colony at the close of the period of 
colonization. It may be found that this topic can be taught 
   
-P-A-G-E-137
A Review and Deductive Lesson 121 
to better advantage at any time during the study of the 
colonies. If the question concerning the government of the 
English colonies in America is raised by the pupils, as a result 
of any reading or investigation, teach the necessary facts per- 
taining to this question at such a time, rather than delay the 
study of this topic until later. 
The work upon the English Colonies in America might 
finally be summarized and reviewed by having a map made to 
represent the extent of the thirteen colonies, and also brief 
reports given upon the manners and customs of the people 
during colonial days. A Red Letter Day Lesson, in conclusion, 
based upon a consideration of leading men of colonial days, 
should give the pupils an excellent understanding of the events 
concerning which they need information. If pupils are in- 
structed to save material for such a lesson, as the study of each 
colony progresses, much of this work will have been done.

The Review. — Subject Matter. The Colonial Assembly in 
Virginia, the Mayflower Compact, and the New England 
Confederation. 
Method. Since these three topics generally have been 
studied, in connection with the study of the colonies, they do 
not appear at this time as new topics, but rather as old material 
viewed in a new light. When discovered first, it was in rela-. 
tion to the events of the particular colony or colonies to which 
each belonged. As reviewed at this time, each event repre- 
sents a link in a chain of events, finally culminating in inde- 
pendence and complete self-government. 
Begin this review by calling upon the pupils to name quickly 
and in chronological order the events in English history by 
which the people gained greater rights and privileges. (Stop 
with the Petition of Rights in 1628.) Now ask the pupils 
to recall any occasions discovered during the study of the 
colonies, which indicated an attempt at self-government by 
the English colonists in America. The majority of pupils will 
be able to recall the First Colonial Assembly, the Mayflower 
Compact, and the New England Confederation. Write 
these upon the board as each is given. 
Now direct the pupils to refer to their textbooks for the pur- 
pose of arranging these topics in chronological order. The cor- 
rect order should be written upon the board, with the date of 
eachevent. Have pupils suggest, also, the proper place for the 
Petition of Rights and the Bill of Rights. Explain why these 
are to be included at this time. The final arrangement will 
appear upon the board in the following manner:

1. The First Colonial Assembly, — Virginia — 1619. 
2. The Mayflower Compact, — Massachusetts — 1620. 
(The Petition of Rights, — England — 1628.) 
3. The New England Confederation, — New England — 1643. 
(The Bill of Rights, — England — 1689.) 
Question the pupils in order to determine how much in- 
formation they have concerning these events. Although a 
general study of these topics was made at the time of the study 
of the colonies, the pupils will quickly discover a need for 
more detailed information in the light of the new problem. 
This will lead directly to the assignment. 
The Assignment.—1. References determined by the 
pupils for study of the three topics referred to in the review. 
2. The discovery by the pupils of the fourth attempt at 
union and self-government, made by the English Colonies in 
America. 
References determined by the pupils. 
Using such references as Mace’s “ School History of the 
United States” 1 and McLaughlin & Van Tyne’s “ A History 
of the United States for Schools” ? as illustration, allow the 
pupils to find the best references for each of the topics referred 
toin the review. These references should be written upon the 
board after each topic when decided upon by the class. Allow- 
ing a moment or two for the class to use, first, Mace, then 
McLaughlin & Van Tyne, consult the index, glance quickly 
at the paragraphs, and select the one judged to be the best. 
The references suggested may appear somewhat as follows:

Discovery of the new fact for consideration. 
Show how the Bill of Rights obtained in England in 1689 
satisfied the people. Give also a few other reasons why 
more than one hundred years elapsed after the New England 
Confederation in 1643 before the English colonies in America 
made another united attempt toward self-government. Men- 
tion the French and Indian War, without going into an account 
of its causes. Simply state that this danger which threatened 
the colonists caused them to attempt a plan of union. This is 
known as our fourth step toward self-government. If no one in 
the class has discovered what this was, write ‘‘ The Albany 
Convention ” as the fourth topic upon the board, and allow 
the pupils to find the references for this topic, as suggested 
above. 
The Study of the Assignment.— I or Minimum Assignment. 
1. Following the references indicated after each topic

written upon the board during the review and assignment, 
read each reference carefully. Be able to tell the important 
facts about each topic. 
2. Which book do you consider gives the more detailed ac- 
count of the New England Confederation? Give the reason 
for your answer. (Written work.)

3. After reading all the references noted for each topic on 
the board, which step toward self-government do you consider 
had the most lasting results? Tell why you think so.

4. Write a list of any questions occurring to you during the 
study of the Albany Convention, concerning which you would 
like more information. 
Verification. — After determining the number working 
upon or having completed each part of the assignment, spend 
the brief time remaining in determining the kind of questions 
written by those reaching the maximum assignment. The 
purpose of this part of the assignment is to discover if the 
pupils realize a need for the study of the Intercolonial Wars.! 
1 Teachers will find Becker’s “Beginnings of the American People,” Hough- 
ton Mifflin Co., of particular value as a reference for personal use during the 
study of the colonization of America and the Revolutionary War. 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
CHAPTER SIX 
UNIT OF INSTRUCTION V _ 
THE INTERCOLONIAL WARS 
When this Unit should be Studied. —If pupils are doing 
any real thinking, the study of the Albany Convention must 
have caused them to ask, “‘ Why did war threaten the French 
and English colonies in America? ” or “ Why were the French 
and English colonists such bitter enemies? ” or questions of a 
similar nature. Because these questions seem the natural 
result of the study of the previous lesson, it is wise to defer 
the further study of the Steps toward Self-Government in 
America until time can be given to the consideration of the 
Intercolonial Wars, culminating in the French and Indian War. | 
Avoid a detailed study of the events of these wars. Spend 
time, however, in discovering the reasons why the mother 
countries were enemies. An Expository Lesson might be 
given to explain: 
1. The rivalry between Spain and England, ending in Eng- 
land defeating the Spanish Armada ; 
2. Between Holland and England, when New Noho 
became New York ; 
3. Between Engin and France, beginning with King 
William’s War and ending with the French and Indian War. 
The first three wars should merely be considered in a general 
way. The three great disputes mentioned above will explain 
126
-P-A-G-E-143
Unit of Instruction V 127 
why the colonies in America took up the struggle. Merely 
name each war, find the length of time each lasted (dates), 
and the most important effect upon the colonists. 
This leads directly to a consideration of such questions as 
were asked in Lesson XVI. Some details are worthy of con- 
sideration at this point. One or two lessons might well be 
devoted to the study of the French and Indian War, in order 
to make clear the conflicting claims of France and England; 
the reason why England wished to strengthen her claim west 
of the Allegheny Mountains; men prominent on each side, 
and the final outcome of the great struggle. The most impor- 
tant points to remember might be summarized by means of a 
Socialized Review. 
With the exception of the completion of the Steps toward 
Self-Government in America, the pupils are now ready to begin 
the study of the Revolution of the English Colonists. Other 
steps toward self-government will be discovered as the pupils 
study the Revolution. As each event is discovered in relation 
to the war, it also should be recognized as a step toward self- 
government. Such events need careful consideration at this 
time. This will aid, however, in later summarizing all which 
may be considered as steps toward self-government. Pupils 
will have a better understanding of the development of the 
spirit of independence, if the steps toward self-government 
which preceded the Revolution are studied prior to the study 
of that unit of instruction. 
1An excellent reference for the study of these wars is Beard-Bagley, “The 
History of the American People,” Chap. V. Teachers will find the problems 
listed at the end of each chapter in this text of great value. The authors have 
suggested a wealth of material which may be used to excellent advantage in the 
average and the maximum assignments.

The Review. — Subject Matter. “ The Rights of English- 
men” in England and America. 
Method. Devote only a brief time in questioning the 
pupils in order to have them recall the ways in which the Eng- 
lish people gained their liberties and what rights were granted. 
Several points which will particularly emphasize the essential 
facts to be kept in mind may be written upon the board. 
The names of pupils who previously had difficulty with these 
topics may be added. These pupils then become responsible 
for reciting upon the topic indicated. Socialize the work by 
allowing other pupils to supplement the answers given, 
through questioning the pupils who have recited, or by adding 
facts themselves. 
Since this subject matter has been studied in detail, and re- 
viewed on several previous occasions, a very brief review should 
be devoted to it at this time. It should be brought up here in 
.

order to help the pupils realize the connection between these 
events and those to be given consideration in future lessons. 
The Assignment.—1. The Problem. What events in 
England and the colonies are considered to be the causes of 
the Revolutionary War? 
2. Collection of data concerning this problem (teacher and 
pupils working together). 
3. Organization of these data into remote or immediate 
causes. 
The Problem. ‘Tell the class that before we can study 
the war itself, we must thoroughly investigate the causes 
of this war. This will lead us to the consideration of certain 
events. Ask the class to suggest the wording of the prob- 
lem which demands investigation. Something similar to the 
above will be obtained, which may be accepted or modified as 
the occasion demands. Write this upon the board for con- 
sideration as the lesson develops. 
Collection of Data. Greater benefit will be derived by 
the pupils if the teacher works with the class, than if an 
attempt is made, through an expository lesson, to explain 
some of these conditions. Select a textbook which gives 
a vivid and accurate portrayal of these events. If only one 
set of books is available, and this set seems inadequate, use a 
single book instead. 
Referring to Dickson’s “ American History for Grammar 
Schools”? as an illustration, the teacher might first read to 
the class Chapter VIII (pp. 148-150), which briefly summarizes 
the situation in the colonies previous to the Revolutionary 
War.? Follow this by a careful consideration of the contents

of Chapters IX and X (pp. 151-158). Call upon different 
members of the class to read these pages aloud. Stop any 
pupil from time to time in order to have the meaning of 
some word looked up and explained, or to give them an oppor- 
tunity to question about any point that is not clear. Do not 
allow pupils to read aloud for an indefinite length of time 
without being interrupted at the end of every paragraph or two, 
or even more frequently, if necessary, in order to make sure 
that real thinking is being done. 
As the different events mentioned in the text are read, 
discussed by the pupils, and frequently elaborated upon by the 
teacher, those which have a direct relation to the problem 
should be written on the board under the problem. Call 
particular attention to chapter headings and marginal notes. 
If it is impossible to cover the facts contained in Chapters 
IX-X during the time for the assignment, discontinue the 
work wherever most advisable, and take up the new work 
at this point upon the following day. Be sure that the pupils 
have a clear impression of the condition of affairs discussed. 
The detailed study of these events will be provided for in the 
study period. The chief point to be kept in mind during the 
assignment is to discover what some of the events were which 
led to the revolution of the colonists. 
Organization of Data. First have the meaning of the 
words “ remote” and “ immediate ” (or “ direct ” and “ in- 
direct,”’ whichever are preferred) looked up by the pupils. 
Now help them to see that there was a gradual accumulation 
of reasons which finally caused the colonists to resist the 
mother country. Strongly emphasize the fact that the colo- 
nists entered the war in order to defend their rights as English- 
men, and not to gain their independence. Pupils are often
-P-A-G-E-147
  
Inductive and How to Study Lesson 13 
given very erroneous impressions unless this point is constantly 
kept in mind. 
Briefly consider the topics written on the board under the 
problem, in order to determine whether they should be classi- 
fied as remote or immediate. Show why a study of the remote 
causes must precede that of the immediate causes. Conclude 
the assignment by writing the term “ Remote Causes ” 
above the topics on the board, when accepted by the class.

form,

  Inductive and How to Study Lesson 133 
table where such material may be obtained will thus become 
the most popular place in the room. Pupils will be eager to 
take these books home in order to complete these articles. 
Interest in material available in school, home or public library, 
will be aroused; and the teacher will find that instead of be- 
ing a teacher of facts only, the study of history has now be- 
come the means by which habits are formed, — habits which 
will enrich the lives of every boy and girl, both for the present 
and the future. What teacher can fail to find a genuine satis- 
faction and comfort in watching the mental development of 
boys and girls when given such training? 
This lesson indicates how the study of the Revolution may 
be begun. It should be followed by a similar lesson or several 
such lessons, if necessary, in order to give the class a thorough 
understanding of the causes, both remote and immediate, 
which made the Revolution inevitable. Keep constantly 
before the minds of the pupils the previous loyalty of the 
colonists and their desire to be faithful subjects. Show how 
the violation of their rights as English subjects brought about 
the final struggle for independence. 
The opportunity for the pupils to realize the spirit of the 
times, by means of access to such source material as referred 
to above, will do much to stimulate the class during the study 
of the Revolutionary War. A lesson on the “ Defenders of the 
American Cause ” will also help to give the class a clear idea 
of the great leaders of that time. Such men as Samuel Adams, 
Patrick Henry, Benjamin Franklin, James Otis, John Adams, 
Robert Morris, and others in America, as well as William Pitt 
and Edmund Burke?! in England, should be studied. Urge the 
pupils to do more than find biographical sketches of these men. 
1 See Beard-Bagley, “The History of the American People.”
-P-A-G-E-150
   134 Supervised Study in History 
Encourage and help them to find material which will give an 
idea of each as a leader in the community in which he lived. 
One of the best ways to teach good citizenship is to give the 
pupils an opportunity to become acquainted with the leading 
men of the past, in the same way that we learn to know the 
great men of the present. The study of Current Events helps 
the pupils to become familiar with the leaders of the present, 
and this knowledge will aid them to understand the ideas and 
principles upheld by the people of the revolutionary period as 
portrayed in the lives of some of the leading citizens of those 
times. 
After making a careful study of topics similar to those men- 
tioned above, enough attention should be given to such events 
as the Battles of Lexington and Bunker Hill, to give the class 
an accurate knowledge of the situation at that time. This 
should be followed by a study of the Declaration of Inde- 
pendence, and how it changed the purpose for which the 
colonists were fighting. 
In general, a detailed study of campaigns should not be 
made. The British plan to gain control of the Hudson, how- 
ever, requires special consideration, and as many lessons 
should be planned upon this point as are found to be necessary. 
Many other facts may be explained by the teacher. Maps 
and pictures should be used wherever they will help in present- 
ing such facts more clearly.

The Review. — Subject Matter. The Struggle for the 
Hudson River. 
Method. The plan submitted for the review of this lesson 
is one which was employed by Miss Mildred Hunt, a teacher 
of history in the Washington Junior High School, Rochester, 
N. Y. One of her classes, a Seven A Grade, had just com- 
pleted the study of Burgoyne’s invasion and the British plan 
to gain control of the Hudson River. In order to review this 
before taking up a new topic in the assignment, the review 
was socialized in the following way: 
A large circle had previously been drawn upon the board. 
This circle contained as many radii as there were pupils in the 
class. Each radius was numbered. A very brief explanation 
of the use to be made of this circle was given to the class. 
The teacher told them she had prepared some questions which 
she was eager to see how accurately they could answer. They  
-P-A-G-E-152
136 Supervised Study in History 
might call the circle on the board a wheel. Each spoke in 
the wheel would represent a pupil in the class. The wheel 
would show at the end of the period how accurately the ques- 
tions had been answered. 
The pupils were then given the privilege of electing some 
member of the class to act as “ wheelwright.” The duty of 
the pupil, elected to take charge of the wheel, was explained 
in the following manner: 
“The pupil having question ‘ one’ will rise and read it 
to the class. The wheelwright will then call some number 
represented on the wheel. The pupil having the correspond- 
ing number will then become responsible for answering the 
question. This pupil will pass to the front of the room and 
face the class, while reciting. At the close of this recitation, 
any pupil in the class may have the privilege of questioning 
this pupil. (Miss Hunt herself controlled this period of 
questioning, rejecting any questions which had been previ- 
ously asked or which were not to the point.) If the pupil 
called upon by the wheelwright can answer the question read, 
together with the questions later asked by the pupils, the 
spoke representing this pupil may remain in the wheel ; other- 
wise, it must be erased.” 
The class then elected their wheelwright. (Rules of parlia- 
mentary procedure are always followed in these elections.) 
The pupil elected took his place at the board; the slips of 
paper containing the questions written by the teacher were 
passed. Each pupil was quickly given a number, and the 
class was ready to begin. 
Not more than five minutes of the time had been consumed 
in the explanation of how to conduct the review, and in the 
election of the wheelwright. The voting, always done by the
-P-A-G-E-153
  A Socialized Lesson - 137 
quickest method (raising hands or a rising vote), required 
very little time. (Nominations are usually limited to two 
pupils, one boy and one girl, if the pupils are not segregated.) 
A period of about half an hour then ensued, during which 
there was the liveliest and best kind of exchange of ideas and 
challenge of statements. Each pupil whose number was called 
made every effort to keep his spoke in the wheel. This group 
of boys and girls successfully demonstrated the power gained 
through this way of working. Every child was alert, watch- 
ing for a point to question or an inaccurate statement to 
challenge at the close of the recitation of each pupil. The 
accuracy and breadth of information equaled and often 
exceeded that of much older pupils, taught by more formal 
methods. A great variety of references were quoted or sen- 
tences read to prove a statement. 
__ A splendid spirit of codperation and good fellowship pre- 
vailed throughout the period. Pupils who were not suffi- 
ciently informed to earn the spoke in the wheel met defeat in 
the right spirit. In one instance the generosity of the class 
was plainly demonstrated, when a small girl, who was greatly 
embarrassed, made a few slight inaccuracies in her answers 
to questions asked her. The class agreed that her spoke should 
be left in the wheel because she had made such an effort to 
answer all their questions. Some one suggested that in order 
to make this fair to the others, a small portion of her spoke 
might be erased to indicate that it was broken. This was 
accepted by the class, and everyone seemed pleased with the 
decision. 
It is needless to say that every pupil enjoyed this work, 
and was greatly benefited by it. At the close of the period, 
the wheel showed very few spokes to be counted as missing or 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
OR ee ee eee ee eee er oe i, en ee ee 
aii 
138 Supervised Study in History 
broken. The accuracy and extent of the knowledge upon this 
question proved the ability of the class to pass successfully a 
severe examination upon the facts pertaining to this topic. 
Continued practice in this kind of work develops something 
greater than an accurate knowledge of history. It develops 
character. 
The Assignment. — 1. Explanation given by the teacher. 
2. Recognition of the new problem. 
Explanation Given by the Teacher. Using maps and 
pictures as previously suggested, the teacher might now give 
the pupils an idea of what was taking place in Washington’s 
army, about the time the British were trying to gain control of 
New York State. A definite conception can be obtained by 
the pupils, if Washington’s and Howe’s movements are traced 
on maps asa brief explanation is given. Conclude this descrip- 
tion by locating the position selected by Washington after 
Howe gained Philadelphia. 
Recognition of the New Problem. A few moments might 
now be allowed for each pupil to decide what he considers the 
most important question to be answered at this time. Allow 
each pupil to state his question. There will doubtless be a 
great variety of these questions, many of which will need to 
be deferred until later. Those who have wondered what 
Washington did after he retreated to Valley Forge, or why he 
did not again attack Howe, will give the teacher the oppor- 
tunity to show the need of more definite information concern- 
ing these points. If any one of the questions asked by the 
pupils can be used as the problem to be considered by the 
class as a whole, it should be accepted and written on the 
board. The following may be used as an illustration: Why 
did Washington spend the winter of 1777 at Valley Forge?

Verification. — After determining how many were working 
upon each part of the assignment, give the remaining time to 
discovering what the pupils did in answering 1, 2, 3 and 4, 
under the minimum assignment. This will determine the 
kind of review needed in the next lesson. Pupils need a great 
deal of training in work of this character. A review where 
books are used and pupils are guided to select the statements

required, is often of the greatest advantage to weaker pupils. 
A brief inspection of the papers will inform the teacher con- 
cerning the ay who have been unable to select the correct 
sentences in answer to sucha direction as I, 2. If the majority 
of the class successfully accomplish this, they might be given 
some special reading for the first part of the time for the 
review the next day, while the teacher works with those 
who particularly need help. 
Suggestions for Other Lessons upon Unit of Instruction VI. 
— Lesson XVIII may now be followed by a lesson upon Aid 
jrom France. There is no better way of presenting this than 
through a discussion of present-day affairs. The neutrality of 
the United States, at the beginning of the World War now 
being fought, the aid given to Belgium, the great loans to the 
Allies, and the entrance of the United States into the war, — 
all these should be referred to in order to help the pupils see 
more vividly the situation in America when France openly 
came to the aid of the new republic. 
It is assumed throughout these lessons that a very systematic 
study is being made of Current Events. Such topics as the 
above have, of necessity, been given careful consideration 
during the Current Events periods. Teachers will, however, 
naturally refer to present-day conditions, wherever they will 
aid in making the past more real to the pupils. More detailed 
suggestions for the teaching of current events will be found 
under the lessons outlined for the Eighth Grade. 
The lesson on Aid from France may be followed by a con- 
sideration of the services rendered the nation by such foreigners 
as Lafayette, Steuben, Kosciusko, and others. A study of the 
Siege of Yorktown, the Surrender of Cornwallis, and the 
results of the war, then concludes the work upon the revolu-

tion of the English colonists in America. Summarize this 
unit of instruction by giving a Red Letter Day Lesson upon 
the Heroes of the Revolution. 
Now go back to unit of instruction IV (4), Steps toward 
Self-Government in America, and review the topics discovered 
during the study of the Revolution, which also have a relation 
to this question. A detailed consideration of the Articles of 
Confederation, and a brief glance at the Constitution of the 
United States then concludes the study of the subject matter 
outlined for the Seven A Grade. (See units of instruction 
IV, V, and VI.)

  CHAPTER SEVEN 
THE EVALUATION OF THE COURSE OF STUDY FOR AN 
EIGHT B GRADE 
How to Evaluate the Subject Matter. — In determining the 
portion of American history to be covered by an Eight B Grade, 
units of instruction VII, VIII, IX, and X may be considered as 
the amount to be accomplished, together with Civics and Cur- 
rent Events, during a semester of twenty weeks. Units VII, 
VIII, and X each require about one-fifth of the time; the re- 
maining two-fifths may, therefore, be devoted to unit IX. 
The subject matter suggested under each unit of instruction 
merely illustrates in a general way, without attempting to give 
a detailed outline, the more important topics which are to be 
given detailed study. The type lessons, previously outlined, 
may contain suggestions which can be applied in planning 
lessons for an Eight B Grade. In fact, pupils of either the 
Eight B or Eight A Grades, who have never been given this 
kind of instruction, are found to be as woefully in need of 
being taught how to study as younger pupils. 
Lessons which should Follow the ‘“‘ Preview.”’ — The con- 
sideration of the Steps toward Self-Government in the Colonies, 
at the close of the Seven A course, has furnished an excellent 
background upon which to base the study of A Need for a 
Stronger Government. In considering this problem give at 
least four lessons. Socialize these first lessons as much as 
possible, in order to determine what the possibilities are with 
the new class. 
L 145  
-P-A-G-E-162
  
  146 Supervised Study in History 
These lessons may be considered as preliminary to the work 
of the semester. They afford both the teacher and pupils 
an opportunity to become acquainted. The pupils are eager 
to experience the difference in ways of working, while the 
teacher utilizes these first lessons to determine the mental 
caliber of the class. Pupils who belong to any one of the 
three groups previously described gradually become classified 
as the work progresses ; and subsequent lessons may be made 
as difficult as conditions will permit.

The Review. — Subject Matter. Topics studied under “A 
Need for a Stronger Government.” 
Method. Since the purpose of this review is to summarize 
all the important facts taught during the several lessons upon 
A Need for a Stronger Government, socialize the lesson by 
conducting this work in the form of a contest. The following
-P-A-G-E-163
An Inductive and Socialized Lesson 147 
topics might be written upon the board previous to the en- 
trance of the class: 
THe NEED FOR A STRONGER GOVERNMENT 
1. Weakness of Congress under the Articles of Confedera- 
2. The disagreements among the states. 
3. Shays’s Rebellion. 
4. The Northwest Territory and the Ordinance of 1787. 
5. Steps toward a more perfect union. 
The teacher should permit the pupils of each row to choose 
a representative. He might then appoint two judges to 
represent the entire class. Chairs should be placed for the 
several representatives, in the front of the room facing the 
class. The judges should also be given seats apart from the 
rest of the class, preferably at one side, where they can easily 
see and hear every member. 
A brief explanation should be given the class before begin- 
ning the review, in order that all may clearly understand the 
responsibility of each member toward the success of this part 
of the lesson. The teacher may now call upon any one of 
the representatives to give a complete discussion of the first 
topicon the board. The pupil called upon should rise, and, 
after giving the source of his information, recite in as accurate 
a manner as possible. 
The row of which this pupil is a representative also becomes 
responsible for giving him any aid. When his recitation is 
completed, any pupil in his row may have the opportunity to 
help him by standing and correcting any error, or by adding 
any information omitted. If a pupil attempts to correct a 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
  148 Supervised Study in History 
point which was not an error, it counts one point against his 
row, and should be recorded by the judges. The teacher may 
need to supervise the work done by the judges in order to 
avoid mistakes, and thus prevent disagreement. 
When the members of this row have completed their state- 
ments, any pupil in any of the other rows who has noticed an 
error which was not corrected, or can make a further addition, 
may rise and after being given permission by the teacher, may 
question the representative to see if he can correct the error 
or give the required fact. Any error the representative now 
makes counts one point against his row. In the same way, 
a pupil who attempts to add a statement which has already 
been given, or to correct a point which was not inaccurate, 
loses a point for his row. 
In the same manner call upon representatives of each row 
for a discussion of one of the topics upon the board. If any 
vital point is omitted the teacher has an opportunity to make 
a statement or add a question when the pupils are no longer 
able to check further points. Under ordinary conditions there 
will be very little remaining for the teacher to question. 
Conclude this review by calling upon the judges for their 
report. This report should tell the points checked against 
each row. The row having the fewest points receives the 
credit of doing the most accurate work. 
The Advantages of this Form of Socialized Review. — 
Teachers will note several benefits from this method of review. 
1. The pupils see the need of accurate information. 
2. Every pupil must be alert all the time. For the good of 
his own reputation and that of his fellow classmates, he cannot 
afford to be inattentive or a ‘‘ dreamer.” 
3. The “contest” element strongly appeals to boys and
-P-A-G-E-165
  An Inductive and Socialized Lesson 149 
girls alike. The spirit of a “ game” greatly aids in holding 
the interest and attention of all. 
4. Many opportunities are afforded for the development of 
initiative and the training of judgment. 
5. Pupils learn to “ play fair” and respect the rights of 
others. 
6. The thinking is not all done by the teacher. 
7. The pupils learn to exercise self-control. 
8. The amount of real thinking done and facts reviewed is 
much broader than by the formal question and answer 
method. 
9. The teacher’s personality does not dominate the entire 
situation. 
10. The pupils are being trained in habits of good citizen- 
ship. 
The Assignment. — 1. New work developed by the teacher 
and problem for the lesson discovered. 
2. Brief statement of situation given by the teacher. 
New work developed by the teacher. Question the 
pupils to see what their present knowledge is concerning such 
terms as “‘ Congress,” “‘ Senate,” “‘ House of Representatives,” 
etc. Discover whether the pupils know how the representa- 
tion in the Senate and House of Representatives is controlled. 
Write these terms on the board as each is discussed. Even 
though the pupils have not yet studied the Government of the 
Nation, they have a general knowledge of many of these 
facts through their study of current events. Defer the answers 
to many of the questions. They should simply be asked in 
order to stimulate thinking upon these points. 
The pupils no doubt will know that the power to regulate 
national affairs is embodied in the Constitution, but they  
-P-A-G-E-166
    | . 
150, Supervised Study in History $0, j need to discover the circumstances under which these provi- 
sions were made. Ask several questions, such as: 
Why are there two houses in Congress? 
Why are the states represented in the Senate, and the 
people in the House of Representatives ? 
How were the laws made by Congress to be enforced ? 
Tell the class that these and many other great problems were 
solved by the delegates to the convention which met at Phila- 
delphia in 1787. If the pupils are now asked what they would 
like to know about this convention, they will give such a 
problem as the following: 
How did the delegates to the Philadelphia Convention make 
the Constitution, and how did it become ‘“‘the Supreme Law 
' of the Land”? 
Brief statement of situation given by the teacher. Very 
briefly but vividly portray to the class the election of delegates 
by all the states (except Rhode Island); name some of the 
leading delegates; mention the disadvantages in traveling at 
that time, and the length of time required for some of the dele- 
gates to reach Philadelphia. Picture the assembling at Phila- 
delphia, and the scene in Independence Hall when the con- 
vention was called to order. A statement or two concerning 
the first step accomplished by the delegates, and the difficulties 
encountered, should complete the assignment. 
The pupils have thus been given a glimpse of the conditions 
under which the convention began its work. They now will 
be eager to determine what the difficulties were which the 
delegates encountered, and how they succeeded in over- 
coming these difficulties. This will constitute the work for 
the study period.

bring to class any book which contains a facsimile of the sig- 
natures of the delegates who accepted the constitution.

  A Deductive Lesson 153 
Method. The first part of the review should be devoted 
to a discussion of the papers written during the study of the 
previous lesson. The teacher might read sentences or para- 
graphs to illustrate certain points, such as pupils not answering 
the question asked, inaccurate statements and incomplete 
answers given, or any point needing further explanation. The 
pupils should be called upon to tell how these points should 
have been given. The three disputes which were settled by 
compromises might be written upon the board. A list of 
words found among the compositions, concerning which the 
teacher questions the pupil’s knowledge, might also be written 
upon the board, and the dictionaries consulted for the meaning. 
The best papers should be exhibited in the room for a short 
time. 
The latter part of the review should be given to reports 
made by individual pupils, upon any collateral reading done 
since the lesson of the previous day. The sources of this 
reading should be written upon the board. Urge the pupils to 
tell why the particular topic reported upon was selected. The 
teacher should be prepared to give the class aid if they have 
been unsuccessful in obtaining material, by placing upon the 
table certain texts to be consulted whenever an opportunity 
is afforded. (See list at end of lesson.) 
The Assignment.—1. Recognition of the fact that the 
problem for consideration has been only partly solved. 
2. A brief consideration of Article VII of the Constitution. 
3. Necessary explanation in preparation for the study 
period. 
Recognition of the fact that the problem is not yet solved. 
The problem considered in the previous lesson should be 
restated by a member of the class, and written upon the 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
  
154 Supervised Study in History 
board. Now ask the pupils their opinion concerning the 
solution of this problem. Determine whether they consider 
it has been solved in full or in part. If the class agrees that 
the first part only has been settled, ask for a statement of what 
is still to be determined before the problem may be considered 
as solved. The pupils will read or restate the latter part of 
the problem. 
“How did it (the Constitution) become the supreme law of 
the land?” 
Article VII of the Federal Constitution. This leads directly 
to a consideration of the adoption of the Constitution by 
the delegates and its ratification by the states. Write the 
words “ adoption ” and “ ratification” upon the board, and 
have each pupil consult his dictionary for the meaning. 
Direct the pupils how to find a copy of the Constitution itself 
(any text may be used for this purpose). Give the class 
sufficient time for all to find Article VII; then call upon some 
one to read it aloud. Encourage the pupils to ask questions 
concerning any point. Devote a few moments to a brief 
study of the list of names signed below Article VII. 
Necessary explanation in preparation for the study period. 
One or two statements will help the pupils to realize why 
such a length of time intervened between the adoption of 
the Constitution and its final ratification by at least nine of 
the states. This will help them to understand the subject 
matter to be studied during the study period.

interesting item found during the silent study period of the 
previous lesson. Permit the pupils to verify their statements 
by reading short passages from any of the sources consulted.

The Review. — Subject Matter. A summary of all impor- 
tant facts studied in considering the problem of the two pre- 
ceding lessons. (See Lessons XIX and XX.) 
Method. The pupils were informed at the close of the 
preceding lesson that they might volunteer to contribute some- 
thing interesting, during this review. They now might be 
given permission to elect a chairman, who should preside 
during this part of the lesson. Any pupil wishing to contrib- 
ute some interesting fact might write his name upon a slip 
of paper. These papers should be collected and given to the 
chairman. The review should be conducted according to 
parliamentary procedure. The chairman should call a name 
written upon one of the slips. The pupil whose name is called 
should rise, address the chair, and tell the topic upon which 
he wishes to report. If given permission by the chairman, this 
pupil should pass to the front of the room, face the class, give
-P-A-G-E-174
158 Supervised Study in History 
the source of information, and then either briefly tell or read 
the topic selected. As soon as the first pupil has completed 
his report, the chairman should immediately call upon another 
pupil. This method of procedure should be continued until 
the time-keeper calls “Time.” It is safe to assume that the 
time will be too brief for all reports to be given. In sucha 
case, the same work might be continued upon the following 
day. Interest will be added if the teacher also contributes 
some brief statement. Bancroft’s “History of the United 
States” + contains some interesting statements which are worth 
bringing to the attention of the class. 
It often happens that a topic, selected by a certain pupil, 
is reported by another before the first pupil has been called 
upon by the chairman. In such a case the first pupil should 
be urged to make another selection. It is interesting as well 
as gratifying to see how well pupils meet such an emergency. 
The Assignment.—1. The preparation of material to be 
recorded in the notebooks. Notebooks. How to use them. 
Nothing has been said in previous lessons regarding the 
matter of notebooks. It is recognized as being a question 
concerning which there is a great difference of opinion. Some 
teachers feel that every fact contained in the course of study 
should be recorded by the pupils in their notebooks. The 
ways in which they are recorded are doubtless as varied as the 
reasons which might be given for requiring this work. 
Other teachers go to the opposite extreme, and require no 
notebook work. Here again may be found a variety of 
reasons why such work is considered unnecessary. It is evi- 
dent, therefore, that there are many arguments both in favor 
of and in opposition to the matter. 
1 Appleton, Voi. VI, pp. 365-367.
-P-A-G-E-175
A Review Lesson 159 
For the benefit, however, of those who do favor the pupils 
keeping notebooks, a lesson of this character offers an oppor- 
tunity to give this matter some consideration at this time. 
What may be expected of Seventh Grade pupils. Let us go 
back for a moment and think of this matter in relation to our 
younger girls and boys of the Seventh Grade. What may we 
reasonably expect them to do in the way of notebook work? 
Is our chief aim with these pupils that of teaching them 
painstakingly to note all facts studied, either in outline form 
or paragraph form (usually dictated by the teacher) ; or have 
we the greater aim of teaching our boys and girls actually to 
love history? If this is our purpose, it then becomes our duty 
to help them understand history. Will a child necessarily 
love or understand history if he is required to keep accurate 
notes of all events studied? If then we are fully conscious of 
our purpose, we shall control this work in such a way that 
our notebook work will serve as a “means,” rather than as 
an “end.” 
How notebook work may be undertaken with Seventh Grade 
pupils. It is not necessary to have notes recorded every day. 
Neither is it wise to allow too long intervals to elapse, and then 
spend an entire period or more in copying “ back notes.” 
Use the notebook for anything which is worth recording and 
require such notes, whenever the occasion demands. Do not 
attempt long, systematic outlines with pupils of this age. 
'Too much time is required, and the pupils are not sufficiently 
developed to realize the worth of such outlines. Long para- 
raphs, as well as long lists of dates, dictated to be memorized, 
lso defeat the greater purpose of history teaching. 
Train the pupils to record facts in brief statement form, 
r in the simplest outline form. A combination seems highly
-P-A-G-E-176
160 Supervised Study in History 
desirable. Such topics as The ways in which the English 
people gained their liberties, and Steps toward self-government 
in America should be entered in brief outline form, while 
short sentences would be a better means of recording such 
topics as Result of the French and Indian War. 
Allow the pupils to suggest topics which they think need 
a word of explanation or a statement for future reference. 
The date of each entry might be worth noting. It may be a 
valuable aid for future reference, and it trains pupils to be 
systematic. Brief notes should occasionally be dictated. 
Pupils need this training. If notebooks are required, insist 
that they shall be well done. A child learns to have little 
respect for anything which he is permitted to do in a heedless, 
careless manner. Time spent in such work is worse than lost, 
as it results in the formation of bad habits. 
Above all things, encourage Seventh Grade pupils to keep an 
individual record of any books which have been consulted, 
in addition to the regular text. A separate place in the note- 
books might be devoted to this purpose. Do not discourage 
the pupils from entering anything they consider valuable, 
provided the item is given a heading or the title and is neatly, 
recorded. 
Especially encourage pupils to collect pictures or clippings} 
pertaining to the topics studied. These, pasted in the note 
book, together with a word or two in explanation, have fa’ 
more value and interest to the child than pages containin; 
formal outlines. A notebook belonging to a Seventh Grad 
pupil, when finished at the end of a semester, should be ver. 
largely composed of notes of the character described above 
the greater portion containing pictures, brief statements, an 
very simple outlines. These pupils will then be able to under
-P-A-G-E-177
  A Review Lesson 161 
take more difficult work in the Eighth Grade. For further 
suggestions upon notebook work, see lessons outlined for the 
Eight A Grade. 
2. The preparation of material to be recorded in the note- 
books by pupils of the Eight B Grade. Pupils of this grade 
should be able to do more systematic work than those of the 
Seventh Grade. The teacher and pupils should now work 
together, and through the suggestions of the pupils and the 
guidance of the teacher, a codperative outline should be 
worked out and written upon the board. Here, again, the 
outline should be kept quite simple. A complicated outline 
of many subdivisions is not necessary. Pupils should be 
taught to recognize the value of careful organization. This 
is one of the chief advantages of outline work. The arrange- 
ment, in an orderly manner, of all important facts, may be 
made to much greater advantage when the teacher works 
with the pupils, instead of permitting them to struggle alone 
without proper direction. They will soon gain power enough 
to do more of the work independently, and may then be en- 
couraged todoso. An outline prepared in such a coéperative 
way is far more valuable to the pupils than one dictated by 
the teacher. Notes prepared in this way, which briefly 
summarize the important points studied in the consideration 
of each problem, will furnish a very good topical outline of 
each unit of instruction taught.

4. Supplement these notes by pasting into your book

Verification. — It will be easy for the teacher, when passing 
around the room during the period for silent study, to de- 
termine whose notebooks look the best; also to select those 
who have the best accounts, clippings, or pictures. These 
pupils should be allowed to go to the front of the room and 
exhibit their books to the class. One or two of the best 
paragraphs might also be read aloud. This will stimulate 
other pupils to greater effort. Emulation is strong with 
pupils of this age. The three lessons planned on the topic 
“ Making the Constitution” are illustrative of the kind 
of work which might be done on other topics of equal 
importance. 
Suggestions for Further Lessons upon Unit of Instruction 
VII. — The lessons upon. Making the Constitution should be 
followed by several lessons upon Starting the new government. 
There are many interesting accounts which the pupils should 
have the opportunity to read, concerning Washington’s 
inauguration, and the great things accomplished by Hamilton. 
Care should be taken to make clear to the pupils thestanding 
of this new republic among foreign nations. Contrast the 
situation at that time with that of the present. Pupils must 
be led to understand that conditions were even more critical 
during the early years of the new republic than they were
-P-A-G-E-179
  A Review Lesson 163 
under the latter years of British rule. Emphasize the services 
rendered by the leaders of that time. Any reference which 
can be made to current events should be used wherever 
possible. It helps the pupils to realize that past events 
frequently resemble those occurring at the present time. 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
  CHAPTER EIGHT 
CURRENT EVENTS 
The Need for Teaching Current Events. — The subject of 
Current Events has been mentioned only in a general way in 
preceding lessons. It has been assumed, however, that work 
has been done along this line with Seventh Grade pupils. It 
is just as important to teach present-day events during the 
history period as it is to teach the events of the past. It is 
through the study of the events of the present, and a close cor- 
relation, wherever possible, with history, that the past may be 
made real to the pupils. Both history and civics demand the 
most accurate study of the affairs of to-day. It is impossible 
to designate just what topics in civics or history should be 
closely correlated with current events. Teachers, however, 
will find many opportunities to make this work of great value 
to the pupils. 
How Current Events may be Taught in the Eighth Grade. — 
A brief period should be provided, several times a week, for 
current events,—at least three fifteen-minute periods, if 
possible. It is well to have definite days for this work in order 
that the pupils may have an opportunity to prepare for these 
periods. This means that pupils will need to do reading 
outside of school. It is only natural that pupils of this age 
ordinarily give little thought or attention to the reading of 
newspapers or magazines. We therefore cannot expect them 
to have any definite knowledge of the great questions of the 
day, unless systematic training is given. 
164
-P-A-G-E-181
  Current Events 165 
There is, however, great satisfaction derived from seeing 
how enthusiastic, interested, and well informed boys and girls 
become when some of their outside leisure time has been suc- 
cessfully and voluntarily devoted to reading the best current 
literature. Teachers have a great work before them, but one 
which gives abundant returns. When pupils who have been 
awakened to the enjoyment and benefits derived from being 
well informed concerning current affairs, return to a teacher 
for several successive terms, after they have been promoted 
from her grade, in order to bring some magazine article or 
newspaper clipping in which they are interested, — that 
teacher has a right to feel some small degree of satisfaction. 
She knows she has done something worth while. 
How to Create an Interest in Current Events. — Many 
chapters might be written upon this matter. It is impossible, 
however, to give more than a few brief suggestions at this 
time. The plan submitted here, for teachers’ to use in any 
way which seems to be most practicable, has been thoroughly 
tested and found to be of great benefit to the boys and girls 
who have received such instruction. 
At the beginning of the semester, spend the time for current 
events in giving the pupils such instruction as will enable them 
to make a systematic study of the important affairs of the day. 
First, determine how many read the papers; what papers 
or magazines they read, and the kind of articles they select. 
Follow this by giving a lesson upon The newspaper and what it 
contains. (If one lesson is not sufficient, devote as much time 
to this as seems necessary.) This will require one or two 
lessons on How to read a newspaper. ‘There is no set formula 
to follow in this matter. It is safe to observe that no two 
people read the paper in the same way. Pupils, however, 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
    
166 Supervised Study in History 
need training in how to evaluate the items of news contained 
in the various parts of the paper. They should be taught to 
read certain items very carefully, and watch the development, 
from day to day, of some of the great issues. Some items 
should be only briefly scanned, while others, of course, should 
be entirely omitted. 
The papers brought to the classroom by the pupils will 
give the teacher a great whsight into the home interests along 
these lines. Many different papers will, no doubt, be in- 
cluded among the ones brought at the request of the teacher. 
This affords an excellent opportunity for a lesson on The kinds 
of newspapers. This ind should result in a list of those 
conceded to be the best, written upon the board. The list 
should contain not only the best local papers, but those which 
have won a reputation in the larger community, — the state. 
Inform the pupils why some papers brought to class are not 
desirable. 
A lesson upon Editorials, followed by a lesson upon What 
the magazine teaches us which the newspaper does not, will also 
result in a list of the best magazines being written upon the 
board. The pupils bibl copy these lists in their notebooks 
for future reference. an we consider that a very large 
percentage of the boys and girls in our public schools come 
from homes where the pa 
appreciate the great op

matter. 
These lessons natura! 
however, because it is o 
not been realized. Urgi rents are foreign born, we may better 
ortunity the school has to educate 
ally, the parents themselves, in this 
ly will take time. It is not wasted, 
ning new lines of interest which have 
as many as possible to subscribe for 
individual copies of any good periodical on current events. 
 
-P-A-G-E-183
  Current Events 167 
Encourage a voluntary subscription toward a fund to be 
devoted to purchasing some of the best periodicals. These 
should be kept upon the reading table, to be used by any 
member of the class, whenever possible. 
Some of the pupils frequently can supplement the ones 
purchased by the class. Magazines which have been read by 
the family at home will soon find their way to the table in the 
schoolroom. ‘Train the children to check any article found 
in the “‘ Table of Contents ” which is of interest to the rest of 
the class. Allow pupils finding articles in this way to men- 
tion the fact to the class. Since adults frequently read some 
article because their attention has been called to it by a friend, 
or because they have heard it mentioned, why should not 
this same means of arousing interest be employed with our 
pupils? 
A teacher can do much to stimulate the pupils unconsciously 
by such questions as: “‘ How many read —-——— (naming the 
article) in this morning’s paper? It contains something in 
which you will be interested; or, I have an article here 
on ————. How many care to read it? or, Here is the 
last number of the Literary Digest ; be sure to read ————_..”” 
A teacher will soon find that the pupils will be eager to antic- 
ipate her questions by bringing in clippings or magazines, 
and greeting her with “ Did you see ————-?” One must 
be well informed, but there is no better game than that 
which the pupils and teacher play in searching for current 
events. 
How to Systematize the Study of Current Events. — This 
work is so closely related to civics, as well as to history, that it 
is difficult to make any distinction. In fact, the suggestions 
given will meet the needs of both. The following plan, recently
-P-A-G-E-184
        168 Supervised Study in History 
   employed by the author, proved to be a real education to the 
pupils. They worked during the entire semester with such 
enthusiasm that there was very little of importance which was 
not read and discussed by them. 
Loose-leaf notebooks (size 8’” X 104/’) were used. These 
served a three-fold purpose, as they contained all notes upon 
history, civics, and current events. One part of the book 
was used as a “ Civics Note Book”; another for ‘ Current 
Events,” while a third part was devoted to “History Notes.” 
Current Events clippings were also used as illustrative material 
for both history and civics. Loose leaves could be inserted, 
when needed, or poorly written pages removed and recopied. 
For the purpose of keeping the clippings collected, a very 
simple but effective filing system was devised. Several en- 
velopes (size 63’’ X 93/’) were given to each pupil. Each 
envelope was given a distinctive label, such as “‘ Local News,” 
“State Affairs,’ “National Affairs,” ‘‘ Foreign Affairs,” 
“ Miscellaneous,” etc. Several lessons were spent in helping 
the pupils to classify the clippings which were brought to class. 
They were directed to write the “ source ” and date upon the 
back of each clipping in pencil, at the time the article was 
selected. These were then classified, with the help of the 
teacher. Any article relating to local affairs was placed in the 
envelope containing that label. Each article placed in this en- 
velope was numbered in the order of entry, and filed by writing 
the number and title of each upon the front of the envelope. 
The same system was used in filing clippings relating to the 
labels upon the other envelopes. This proved of great value 
in enabling the pupils to organize the clippings obtained. 
As topics were studied, either in civics or history, concerning 
which clippings could be found, or had already been found,
-P-A-G-E-185
  Current Events 169 
they were filed in these envelopes until the study of the sub- 
ject was completed. They were then pasted in the notebook, 
following any notes which were entered upon the topic. When 
pasted in the notebook, the “source” and “date” were 
written above each clipping. Pictures were filed in the same 
manner. 
The part of the notebook devoted to “‘ Current Events” was 
separated into sections corresponding to the labels on the 
several envelopes. All clippings which had no relation to 
topics studied in history or civics, were pasted in the note- 
book under the proper heading arranged for “ Current 
Events.” The pupils derived great pleasure as well as real 
benefit from this work. 
A simplified form of this plan was also organized with 
Seventh Grade pupils. In this case, a single notebook con- 
tained the contributions of the entire class. This was kept by 
one or two pupils, chosen by the class to serve as “ Current 
Events Secretaries,” for a period of one week. The pupils 
were thus given a start in the work which as Eighth Grade 
pupils they were able to continue in greater detail. For 
further suggestions upon this question, see lessons planned for 
pupils of the Eight A Grade. 
How to Conduct the Current Events Period. — Although 
many lessons should be devoted to work such as described 
above, time should also be given to recitation and discussion 
upon the material collected. During the first part of the 
semester, the time should be spent in teaching the pupils 
how to obtain and classify the material collected. As soon, 
however, as the right habits have been acquired, this matter 
should be given only enough time to make sure that it is not 
being neglected. This gives more opportunity for discussion. 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
    170 Supervised Study in History 
As previously stated, definite days for the consideration of 
current events secures better results. This does not mean, 
however, that this plan must be strictly adhered to. When- 
ever the situation seems to demand a reference to current 
events, or a careful study of some topic, it should be made at 
that time. 
Employ any good method which seems best to meet the 
needs of the particular class receiving instruction. Specify 
definite days when certain rows may be required to report 
upon items of local interest; others, upon those of foreign 
interest, etc. Always insist upon the source of information 
and the date being given, before the report is made. Allow 
other pupils to ask questions or add further statements from 
other clippings upon the same topic. Those reported from 
sources considered unreliable should not be kept for filing. 
Clippings containing items of little value should be given 
only enough consideration to enable the pupils to understand 
why they are of little value. Frequently refer this matter to 
the class for judgment. A little training of this kind will 
cause pupils to avoid selecting topics which may be con- 
sidered unimportant. 
Socialize this work in every way possible. Occasionally 
introduce a few new elements. A slight variation from the 
general plan frequently renews interest and thus increases 
effort. The spirit of contest may be used to excellent ad- 
vantage here. The collecting instinct is strong with pupils 
of this age, and, if properly directed, brings most gratifying 
returns. 
The greater part of this work should be voluntary. How- 
ever, occasional reports made upon magazine articles which 
have been assigned to certain pupils by the teacher, often 
 
-P-A-G-E-187
  Current Events 17 
help in stimulating others to read the same article. If in- 
dividual copies of any current event paper or magazine are 
taken by the pupils, the day upon which these periodicals 
arrive might be devoted to studying the articles, pupils and 
teacher working together. Avoid permitting the pupils to 
read the first item and to follow this merely by reading each 
iteminturn. Question the pupils and encourage them to ask 
questions. Ask the pupils to glance over the headings of the 
items upon the first page and select the one each considers 
the most important. The consensus of opinion will be easily 
determined. Have this item read silently by each; then call 
upon a pupil to rise and attempt to answer any questions 
asked by other pupils concerning this topic. 
When the papers are not used, and pupils report upon clip- 
pings found, insist upon these reports being told and not 
read to the class. This prevents careless, thoughtless habits, 
and the time for this work becomes a period which requires 
careful research, definite knowledge, and unbiased judgment. 
Never permit pupils to utilize this period in voicing biased , 
personal opinions, often based upon inadequate information or 
wrong viewpoint. It should be a period for gaining informa- 
tion. The discussions are necessary in order to under- 
stand the questions receiving consideration. Teachers will 
find other ways of conducting this work which will be equally 
valuable.

Current Events. — Permit the class to elect a ‘“ Current 
Events Secretary.” The pupil elected should take charge of 
the class during the current events period. Pupils having an 
item of current interest should volunteer by rising. The 
secretary should then call upon each in turn. The pupil 
called upon should pass to the front of the room, face the class, 
and give the title of the topic as well as the source from which 
it was obtained. Then, as briefly and quickly as possible, 
the report should be given. Unless an item is rejected be- | 
cause it is unimportant, some comment should be made upon 
each article. The classification of each item might be re- 
ferred to the class. The pupils then become responsible for 
deciding whether the items are of local, national, or foreign 
interest. Items previously reported upon should be re- 
viewed frequently, in order to compare a previous report
-P-A-G-E-189
A Lesson in Appreciation 173 
with the present report, and thus show development. This 
method of following the development of an event affords 
an excellent opportunity for the suspension of judgment. 
Definite decisions cannot be made until further developments 
are known. The period might be closed by a brief report 
made by the secretary, who has taken notes upon the work 
accomplished. 
The Review. — Subject Matter. The visit of the French 
and British Commissioners to the United States, April 22, 
1917. For the purpose of illustrating the point, it will be 
assumed that this lesson is taught about the time or shortly 
after the visit of these commissioners. 
Method. Since this was one of the great questions to 
receive consideration during the current events period, at the 
time of the arrival of the commissioners, the matter should 
be brought up in the form of a review. Newspaper clippings 
previously collected should again be referred to. Magazine 
articles, such as those found in the “ Literary Digest,” ‘ The 
Outlook,” ‘ The Independent,” ‘‘ Current Events ” (May 5, 
1917), and other periodicals of the same character, should be 
used. Select paragraphs or passages which describe the 
purpose of the visit, and the manner in which the com- 
missioners were everywhere received by the people. Par- 
ticularly emphasize their reception in Washington, New 
York, and other large cities. Have different pupils read brief 
sentences to show the enthusiastic greetings accorded General 
Joffre and other members of the French Commission. 
This should be done largely by the pupils. The teacher, 
however, needs to direct the work, adding a statement wher- 
ever necessary, in order to make sure that the pupils are 
receiving the right impressions. The teacher’s work in pre- 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
  
  174 Supervised Study in History 
paring for this lesson will be greatly simplified, if articles 
similar to those mentioned above are marked and kept for 
such needs as those of the present lesson. Teachers who 
have carefully evaluated the course, and are thoroughly 
posted concerning the subject matter to be taught, will in- 
stantly recognize the value in any item of current interest 
which may be used to better illustrate past events. Much 
invaluable material will be collected in this way. 
The Assignment. — 1. The association of present and past 
events. 
2. The subject matter to be studied, found by the pupils. 
The association of present and past events. Through the 
impressions the pupils have been given as a result of study- 
ing the present-day affairs mentioned above, the teacher should 
now help them to look back to the time in America, nearly 
one hundred and twenty-five years ago, when France sent an 
agent upon a similar mission. Picture to the class the situa- 
tion in France at that time, and the reason the people were so 
eager to gain assistance from the United States. Allow the 
pupils to attempt to tell why France expected America to help 
her. 
Now briefly contrast the European situation of 1793 with 
that of 1917, and also emphasize the difference between the 
United States as a world power then and now. Help the pupils 
to realize that the situation in 1793 between France and 
America differed greatly from that of the present, but that 
the purpose of the visit made by the commissioner sent to 
America by France in 1793, was similar to that of the com- 
missioners sent to America by France in 1917. 
This leaves the class with a desire to discover : — Whom did 
France send to America in 1793, and what did he accomplish?
-P-A-G-E-191
  A Lesson in Appreciation 175 
This should then become the problem for the study of the 
assignment. 
The subject matter to be studied, found by the pupils. The 
pupils should now consult the texts selected for this lesson, 
and by following the teacher’s suggestion, locate the pages 
which contain an account of Citizen Genet’s visit to America. 
The directions on the board should be read and page ref- 
erences written after each question.

Verification. — After determining the number who have 
accomplished each part of the assignment, devote the rest of 
the time to reading to the class some of the papers which 
have been found to be particularly good. The detailed review 
will naturally be given the next day, but it encourages the 
pupils to have some recognition given to satisfactory work, 
directly following its completion. 
Further Suggestions for the Study of Unit of Instruction 
VIII. — The lessons on this unit of instruction should all aim 
to give the pupils a clear idea of the difficulties which our new 
republic encountered in attempting to establish her rights upon 
the seas.!_ Emphasize the enmity between France and Eng- 
land at that time, in order to show why it was a doubly 
difficult situation for the United States. In all lessons refer 
to present-day conditions wherever possible. 
The study of the War of 1812 should be centered upon a con- 
sideration of the causes, and the position gained by the United 
States as a result of the war. A study should be made only 
of such details as are of interest in certain localities. The 
teacher must use his own discretion concerning this point. 
The history of the writing of the Star Spangled Banner is, 
however, of common interest to all citizens, and should be 
given enough background for the pupils to understand why 
Francis Scott Key was inspired to write this poem, and how 
it became our national song. 
A lesson at the close of the study of this unit of instruc- 
tion might be devoted to the topic United States Commerce 
in 1817 and 1917. An excellent Red Letter Day Lesson 
might be planned upon this topic. Pictures, magazine 
articles, newspaper clippings and texts will contribute toward|

States.

The Review. — Subject Matter. A summary of all topics 
pertaining to slavery from 1619 to 1820. 
Method. It is assumed that this is not the first lesson 
taught on this question. This lesson will have been preceded 
by a review lesson on such topics as: 
1. The introduction of slavery into Virginia, 1619. 
2. The Ordinance of 1787 and the slavery question. 
3. The provisions in the constitution concerning slavery. 
4. The invention of the cotton-gin and its results. 
Begin the review by having the pupils number by fours. 
Allow between five and ten minutes for all pupils having 
number “one” to prepare questions upon the first topic. 
Pupils having numbers “two,” “three,” and “ four” should 
lso prepare questions upon the topics of corresponding num- 
N
-P-A-G-E-194
  178 Supervised Study in History 
ber. Urge them to write questions beginning with “ how ” 
or “ why.” | 
Pupils responsible for questions upon topic “ one ” should 
stand, pass to the front of the room, and form a row facing 
the class. The teacher should now call upon each one in 
turn to read his questions. These pupils should be per- 
mitted to call upon any one whom they wish to select, pro- 
vided no pupil is called upon more than once by any 
questioner. If a question is indefinite, the teacher should 
aid the pupil to restate it. Pupils who follow the first 
questioner should omit from their questions any which 
previously have been asked. All pupils should keep notes 
on any errors in answers given. These errors should be 
corrected after the last pupil having questions on topic 
“one” has read his questions. The teacher should add 
any necessary fact, or correct an erroneous impression upon 
any point, before the pupils having questions on topic 
“two” are called to the front of the room. Continue in 
the same manner for review of topics “three” and “four.” 
Although there may be seven or eight pupils to question 
the remainder of the class upon the same topic, many questions 
will have to be omitted if there is a similarity to previous 
questions. The interest 7: be very keen among the pupils 
because all are given an equal opportunity. 
The Assignment.— 1. The statement of the new problem. 
2. Instruction preparatory to the study of the assignment. 
The statement of the problem. As a result of the review, 
the pupils are able to realize to what extent slavery had| 
developed, following the invention of the cotton-gin. They 
now need to be led to see the reasons for the various points| 
of view among the different states. ‘The teacher should mak
-P-A-G-E-195
  How to Study Lesson 179 
a few preliminary statements concerning this point. (More 
information will be gained by the pupils, themselves, later 
in the lesson.) Now simply state the fact that although the 
question of slavery had come up in various ways (as noted 
in the review), it was two hundred years from the time slavery 
was introduced into this country before it became a serious 
national issue. This will cause the pupils to ask why, and 
thus give rise to a problem similar to the following: — Why 
did the extension of slavery become a national question in 
1820, and how was this question settled ? 
Instruction preparatory to the study of the assignment. 
Using Fiske’s ‘“‘ History of the United States” as an illus- 
tration, direct the pupils to consult the index for the word 
“slavery.” Devote only enough time to this for the pupils 
to decide what references may be omitted because of previous 
knowledge upon the subject. The pupils should make this 
decision by turning to each page and briefly scanning its con- 
tents. If it is found to be a reference to something already 
studied and reviewed, the page should not be read. Such 
references as those found on pages 129, 148, and 150 should be 
located as quickly as possible by all. A pupil should then be 
called upon to rise and read the sentence or short passage 
referred to, as each is found. In this way all familiar or 
unimportant facts will be very quickly eliminated, and we 
then come to the new facts which require study and explana- 
tion. 
Since much of this new material is devoted to an explana- 
tion of the situation which led to the Missouri Compromise, 
his subject matter should be studied by the pupils and teacher 
orking together. All pupils should now open their books 
O page 312 (paragraph 118). Direct their attention to    
   
         
              
   
  
-P-A-G-E-196
  180 Supervised Study in History 
the topical heading and the marginal note. Now allow the 
pupils to read the first paragraph silently. The teacher 
should then ask such questions as the following : 
1. What is meant by “the victories of Harrison and 
Jackson”? (Permit a pupil to find a reference which will 
answer this question.) 
2. Explain the meaning of “ Pittsburg, the Gateway of the 
West.” 
3- Consult the index to see if you can find any reference to 
the “era of good feeling,” mentioned in the last sentence in 
the paragraph. (Direct a pupil to read this reference and 
later report to the class.) 
4. Give a brief summary of this paragraph. (Call for 
reports after this summary is given. The pupil making the 
report should first re-read or restate the point which required 
added research.) 
Explain to the class that the invention of the steamboat 
(mentioned in the paragraph) will be considered later in 
solving another problem. In this way they will be kept to 
the point and will not stray too far from the topic under con- 
sideration. 
After allowing time for the pupils to read the next para- 
graph, call upon one of them to state, in one sentence, the 
main thought in this paragraph. The next paragraph might 
be read aloud by the teacher, who should stop to question the 
pupils onany point needing special attention, such as: (1) What 
kind of work was done by slaves in the northern colonies? 
(2) Why were slaves considered necessary in the southern 
colonies? What were the compromises made in the Consti- 
tution concerning slavery? 
The paragraph on “ Slavery takes on New Life,” might be 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
  
How to Study Lesson 181 
read silently, and the pupils then directed to ask a question, the 
answer to which will be the most important fact in the para- 
graph. Dictionaries should be consulted for the meaning of 
such words as “ counterbalanced ” and “‘ equipoise.” 
Since the next paragraph is upon a topic previously studied 
(the Ordinance of 1787), it should be omitted entirely, with the 
exception of the last sentence, which is needed to understand 
the following paragraph. Now ask the class to glance at the 
next paragraph and decide what state caused the slavery 
question to become a national question in 1820. Refer to the 
problem again in order that the pupils may realize that they 
have found the solution to Why the extension of slavery became 
@ national question in 1820. How this question was settled 
will be discovered in the study of the assignment. 
The Study of the Assignment.— I or Minimum Assignment. 
1. Finish reading the references in Fiske which tell 
about the Missouri Compromise. 
2. Consult the index of Dickson’s “ History for Grammar 
Schools,” for references upon the Missouri Compromise 
(pp. 316-318). Read these references carefully in order to 
determine how the facts contained in this text compare with 
the ones read in Fiske. 
3. Asa result of reading these two texts, what conclusions 
concerning the Missouri Compromise may you reach upon 
the following points: 
(a) Why was there a disagreement in Congress when 
Missouri applied for admission into the union in 1818? 
(6) How many free states and slave states were there then 
in the union? 
(c) Whose influence in Congress finally secured a compro- 
mise upon the matter? 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
  
182 Supervised Study in History 
(d) What were the provisions of this compromise? 
(e) Why did this compromise settle, for a time, the dis- 
pute over the extension of slavery? 
II or Average Assignment. 
4. Prepare a brief outline to show all the topics thus far 
studied concerning slavery in the United States. 
IIT or Maximum Assignment. 
5. Draw a map to illustrate the extent of slavery in 1820. 
(See Fiske, p. 315.) 
Verification. — Some of the maps begun during the prepara- 
tion of the minimum assignment will not be completed at the 
close of the study period. Provisions should be made for this 
in the average or maximum assignment for the next lesson. 
Any pupil who succeeds in drawing a good map should be 
permitted to draw it upon the board in colored crayon. This 
map should be used during the review upon the following 
day, as well as during further study of the slavery question. 
All pupils who have reached the maximum assignment 
might be asked to come to the front of the room and exhibit 
their maps to the class. The other pupils should refer to 
page 315 of Fiske, and decide which pupil has drawn the best 
map. In this way the attention of the entire class will be 
directed to at least a brief consideration of this map. 
Many lessons such as the foregoing should be given during 
the semester. The subject matter will be much better under- 
stood, and more will be accomplished in the end, because time, 
which is frequently wasted upon the repetition of certain 
lessons, may be spent in training the pupils to help them- 
selves. Instruction of this kind does not cripple pupils. If 
given frequently enough to result in habit formation, lessons 
of this type give the pupils an insight into how to interpret
-P-A-G-E-199
  An Expository Lesson 183 
the text. This is very essential with children of any grade. 
Eighth Grade pupils, however, are able to do more detailed 
work in this respect than those in the Seventh Grade.

The Review. — Subject Matter. The Missouri Compromise 
and other questions, previously studied, pertaining to slavery. 
Method. Since the study of the slavery question must be 
continued for some time, a good method to introduce at this 
point would be a Rapid Fire Review which might be explained 
in the following manner : 
“ The time-keeper may allow the class five minutes. De- 
vote that time to thinking of questions on any topic we have 
studied concerning slavery. In order to discover what facts 
need further review, let us simply ask ‘fact questions’; 
that is, questions which will require only a brief statement of 
facts in order to answer them. We will appoint (pupil’s 
name) to be the secretary. Your duties will be to call the  
-P-A-G-E-200

184 Supervised Study in History 
{ 
roll and keep a record of all pupils who are unable to 
answer the particular question asked. The first pupil called 
upon may rise, ask his question, and call upon any one he 
desires to answer. If that pupil is unable to answer, the 
questioner should then call upon another pupil. In every 
case, a pupil who cannot answer his question must write the 
question upon a slip of paper and sign his name upon the 
back of the slip. (These may be collected later during 
the study period, when the teacher has an opportunity to 
work with individual pupils.) The secretary should also 
check on his list the names of those unable to answer. This 
list will be used later in calling upon pupils for the correct 
answer to any questions missed.” 
Now allow five minutes for the pupils to think of questions. 
Direct the time-keeper to call “time.” The secretary will 
then take his place in the front of the room, and the review may 
begin. 
Five minutes are sufficient for the pupils to prepare one or 
two questions. It is not necessary for them to have a long list 
of questions, as others will be suggested by the points brought 
out during the progress of the lesson. A few moments are 
necessary at the beginning in order to give the pupils who are 
first called upon an opportunity to have their questions 
ready, so that there need be no loss of time when the review 
begins. | 
The Assignment. — 1. Explanation given by the teacher. 
2. The consideration of the facts upon which the problem 
for the lesson depends. 
Explanation given by the teacher. It seems necessary at 
this point, through a brief statement given by the teacher, 
to help the class understand the difference in point of view   
     
-P-A-G-E-201
  
An Expository Lesson 185 
between the North and the South concerning slavery, and how 
this difference was constantly becoming a serious national 
problem. Tell about the spread of the abolition movement, 
through such leaders as William Lloyd Garrison. Picture to 
them the situation when Texas wished to be admitted to the 
union. Give the reasons why the North opposed this an- 
nexation and the South favored it. (Have pupils consult maps 
in order to make perfectly clear the location of Texas in rela- 
tion to the Missouri Compromise line.) Inform the class of 
the fact that the southern representatives in Congress won 
their point and Texas was admitted. Now tell the class that 
the annexation of Texas led to a still more serious complica- 
tion of the slavery question; and that this was brought 
about as a result of an event which happened because of 
this annexation — that is, the Mexican War. 
The Mexican War, as a war, should be entirely disregarded. 
Explain to the class why it is unnecessary to spend time upon 
the events of this war. Ask the pupils if they can now see why 
we need to give some attention to the results of this war. 
Make it clear that it is only because of the connection this 
topic has with the slavery question that we pause to consider 
it at all. Such statements as those found in Dickson’s 
“ American History for Grammar Schools” (pp. 350-351), and 
Channing’s “ Students’ History of the United States’?! (pp. 
388-389) might be read to the class. 
Help the pupils to locate all territory gained by the United 
States from the first Mexican cession. Now ask the pupils 
to state what they consider the reason for their brief study of 
the annexation of Texas and the territory gained as a result of 
the Mexican War. Write on the board any statements which 
1 Macmillan,
-P-A-G-E-202
  186 Supervised Study in History 
show that the pupils recognize the need for further considera- 
tion of the slavery question. 
Consideration of facts upon which the problem depends. 
Through suggestions and questions, certain statements 
made by the pupils may be used in securing a problem similar 
to the following: How was the question of slavery settled in 
the new territory acquired as a result of the Mexican War? 
The Study of the Assignment. — Directions. 
After looking up the answer to any question missed during 
the review, consult the text upon your desk, and find your

Verification. A few moments devoted to determining 
the opinion of the pupils who had reached the maximum 
assignment will aid in directing the attention of the entire 
class to the fact that the effects of this Compromise were of such 
a serious character that it only widened the breach between 
the two sections of the union. The next lesson should deal 
with these effects. This will require a study of such topics as 
The Fugitive Slave Law; The Personal Liberty Bills; ‘“ The 
Underground Railroad”; “ Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” etc. 
This unit of instruction will be satisfactorily completed only 
when a thorough study has been made of such topics as 
the following : 
The Kansas-Nebraska Bill. 
The struggle between the free and slave states over the 
settlement of Kansas. 
The effects of John Brown’s raids. 
The Dred Scott case. 
Lincoln’s election and Buchanan’s attitude. 
The attempts at conciliation. 
The secession of South Carolina and other southern states.

At the end of the study of this question a lesson should 
be given on the great leaders for and against slavery. Many 
facts will be reviewed in this way, beside giving the pupils an 
opportunity to realize that this great problem aroused the 
citizens of that period in the same way as present-day events 
affect the citizens of to-day.! 
1 For the study of the slavery question the author has found no text which 
equals that of ‘The History of the American People” by Beard-Bagley. 
Teachers will find Chap. XXI extremely helpful because of its excellent 
organization of the events connected with the history of the great slavery 
movement. i

  CHAPTER NINE 
UNIT OF INSTRUCTION X.—THE CIVIL WAR 
General Statement Concerning Unit of Instruction X. — 
It is very easy to spend more time than is necessary in study- 
ing the events outlined under this unit of instruction. With 
few exceptions, the study of campaigns and battles should be 
avoided. If pupils show any interest in gaining information 
upon these points, material for maximum assignments or out- 
side reading should be placed at their disposal. 
The essential points which should be given consideration 
may be summed up in the topics outlined under this unit (see 
pages 22-23). In studying the causes of this war, great 
care should be taken to prevent pupils from drawing the 
erroneous conclusion that it was caused entirely by the 
slavery dispute. 
The systematic study of unit of instruction IX, culminating 
in the secession of the southern states, will give the teacher 
an opportunity to make sure that the pupils have the right im- 
pression concerning this point. At all times, avoid impressing 
one’s personal viewpoint upon the minds of the pupils. The 
great impressions to leave with them are those to be gained 
by the pupils themselves through the kind of instruction given 
during the study of some of the most important events of that 
time. 
Particular attention should be given to the cost of the war, 
in order to realize the great loss of property and life, as well

as the debts incurred by both sections. The results of the war, 
if given proper consideration, will prepare the pupils’ to under- 
take the study of the conditions existing in the South at the 
close of the war. This topic will be given special considera- 
tion when pupils begin the study of the “‘ Period of Reconstruc- 
tion.”

ducted. They will then be eager to do outside reading, in 
order to become informed concerning the topics to be discussed

during the review upon the following day. Ask how many 
in the first row care to volunteer to be responsible for a 
part of the review. It is needless to say that, under ordi- 
nary conditions, every pupil will be anxious to have some 
part in this work. Give the pupils of each row an oppor- 
tunity to volunteer in the same way. Then write upon 
the board : 
Row 1.—Important facts about the battle between the 
Monitor and the Merrimac. 
Row 2.— The effects of the battle upon both the North 
and the South. 
Row 3.— Biographical sketch of the life of John Ericsson. 
Row 4.— Pictures and brief accounts from old newspapers 
or magazine articles. 
Row 5.— The effect of the battle between the Monitor and 
the Merrimac upon future naval warfare. 
Row 6.— Modern naval warfare. (To be illustrated by 
pictures ; reference to magazine articles ; newspaper clippings, 
or accounts of experiences of friends.) 
Urge pupils who have any material which may be con- 
tributed to others responsible for any of these topics, to give 
any assistance possible in collecting information. In work of 
this kind, teachers will find advantage in having the pupils 
seated according to ability, as previously explained. It will 
then be a simple matter to regulate the assignment of such 
topics as the above. The more difficult topics may be given 
to pupils of the average and superior groups, while the others 
may be prepared by the weaker ones. Since the pupils 
themselves are unconscious of this grouping, each will feel 
his personal responsibility toward the success of the lesson, 
without realizing that any distinction has purposively been 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
  192 Supervised Study in History 
made to fit the ability of each group. An invitation to a 
teacher and class of a similar or lower grade will do much 
to stimulate pupils to give their best efforts. 
How to conduct the review. The topic for which each 
row is responsible should be written upon the board in the same 
form as at the close of the lesson of the previous day. Permit 
the pupils to elect a conductor of the lesson. The teacher 
should then appoint three judges. The conductor should begin 
the lesson by very briefly explaining upon what the review is to 
be based. He should also call attention to the topics upon the 
board, and the row responsible for each topic. The first row 
should then be called upon by the conductor. These pupils 
should pass to the front of the room, and, in turn, contribute 
facts considered important by each one. The teacher may 
need to aid the conductor at certain points. In order to give 
all an opportunity to make a single important statement, 
each should be called upon in turn by the conductor. One 
pupil should then be selected to give a complete dissertation 
upon the topic. 
The time-keeper should apportion the time among the dif- 
ferent rows, and call “time” when each row has had its 
allotted portion. The second row then should pass to the 
front while the pupils in the first row take their seats. In 
this way no time is lost. A few moments devoted to the 
organization of such details, before the work actually begins, 
saves much time. This has a great effect upon the discipline 
and class spirit. 
The review should close with the reports given by the three 
judges who have been responsible for noting any inaccuracy. 
Each judge should also be allowed to make any contribution 
upon the topic for which he was also responsible. These

                     judges should reach some agreement in regard to which row 
secured the most information, and gave this in the most 
satisfactory manner. 
Although the teacher’s part in a lesson of this kind appears 
to be very far from prominent (which is as it should be), the 
closest kind of supervision is necessary. There will be many 
places throughout the lesson where guidance, by means of 
directions, suggestions, and questions, is essential to the real 
success of such work. In this way only may results be secured 
which are valuable in the formation of right habits of thought 
and action. 
The Assignment. — 1. Explanation necessary in studying 
about the emancipation of the slaves. 
2. The problem for consideration: How was the slavery 
question finally settled? 
3. References pertaining to the problem found by the class. 
Explanation necessary in studying about the emancipation 
of the slaves. The brief time for this explanation might 
be devoted to a review of the slavery situation at the beginning 
of the war, and Lincoln’s personal views upon the matter. 
Tell the class that this great question, which had been so 
bitterly contested, was at last settled by the President. Ques- 
tion the pupils to see if they can tell why former presidents 
had not settled this matter, if Lincoln had the authority to 
doso. Refer to the Constitution to see if any mention is made 
there of such power. Any facts concerning the emancipation 
of the slaves which the pupils will find for themselves during 
the study period should be avoided by the teacher. Only 
the most general statements should be made here in order to 
help the pupils realize that they are to find How the ques- 
tion of slavery was finally settled.

The problem for consideration. After the problem: 
How was the slavery question finally settled? has been 
determined by the class, it should be written upon the board. 
Now ask the pupils how many know ayo fact about the way 
in which Lincoln succeeded in settling ' is question. There 
are usually a few members in every class who will have dis- 
covered something upon this question. If such terms as 
“ emancipation ” and “ proclamation ” are given by the pupils, 
they should be written upon the board. Dictionaries need to 
be consulted, and the meaning of each word thoroughly under- 
stood before any reference is made to the textbooks. Little 
time, however, need be spent in having the pupils discover 
these terms. If these words are unfamiliar to the pupils, write 
them on the board, and proceed to have the pupils determine 
the meaning as mentioned above. 
References pertaining to the problem found by the class. 
Referring to Fiske’s ‘‘ History of the United States,”! as an 
illustration, direct the pupils to consult the index for the word 
“emancipation.” They should then read the directions 
on the board, under the “ Study of the Assignment,” in order 
to determine what must be done when studying this question. 
The Study of the Assignment.— TI or Minimum Assignment. 
1. Find the reference given in Fiske concerning this 
topic; read this reference carefully, and then prepare at least 
five questions to cover all points you consider important.

Verification. — The thirteenth amendment will be referred 
to again in the consideration of a later problem. It must be 
discovered here, however, as a final chapter to the study of this 
great question which has required so many lessons. Close this 
lesson by directing the pupils to turn to the thirteenth amend- 
ment to the Constitution, have this read, and its meaning 
very briefly discussed. Dismiss the class with the feeling 
that they have completed a good piece of work, as far as the 
question of slavery is concerned. The Civil War, however, 
requires further study, and as many lessons as seem necessary 
should be devoted to the topics outlined under unit of in- 
struction X.

  CHAPTER ‘il 
A RED LETTER DAY PROGRAM 
Tue final lessons upon unit of instruction X should include 
a Red Letter Day Lesson. An excellent opportunity for such 
a lesson is found in many of the interesting accounts written 
about the great heroes or leaders of the Civil War. Pupils 
derive greater benefit from a class exercise of this character 
than could possibly be gained from many lessons based upon 
the detailed study of campaigns. 
The program submitted here is illustrative of the possibilities 
open to every teacher who attempts supervised study. It is 
so suggestive that it needs little explanation. Much credit, 
however, is due to the teacher under whose supervision it was 
prepared and conducted. The real enjoyment and interest 
which were so apparent throughout if lesson, could not fail 
to convince an observer that these boys and girls were receiv- 
ing a kind of training which is influential in producing citizens 
who will become leaders in any community. There was no 
question about the extent of information and the effort put 
forth in collecting the data for this lesson. 
One thing-which was of particular interest was the way in 
which each member of the class felt a personal responsibility 
toward the success of the lesson. This was demonstrated 
when a pupil who was called upon prefaced his contribution 
by telling the class that the main point in his report had been, 
196

given by another pupil. He briefly stated what this point 
was, and then asked permission to give a report upon an 
incident which he had found most interesting in the biography 
of Robert E. Lee. The report which followed was both 
interesting and instructive, but it proved that this boy was 
capable of doing something much greater than give an inter- 
esting report, — he was able successfully to meet an emer- 
gency.

CHAPTER ELEVEN 
GENERAL STATEMENT CONCERNING THE SUBJECT 
MATTER TO BE STUDIED IN THE EIGHT A GRADE 
THE completion of the study of the Civil War and its results 
terminates the work to be accomplished by pupils of an 
Eight B Grade during a period of twenty weeks. Assuming 
that the study of elementary American history extends only 
through the Eighth Grade, the portion which must receive 
the attention of Eight A pupils will necessarily be such events 
as are of greatest importance from the Civil War to the present 
time. 
The topics noted under units of instruction XI, XII, XIII, 
and XIV (see pages 23-25) illustrate those which will leave 
with the pupils the most vivid impressions of conditions influ- 
encing the development of our nation during the period cover- 
ing the last fifty years of our history. Ifa careful study ismade 
of the topics listed under each one of these units of instruction, 
it will be evident that many minor topics either must be given 
slight consideration or omitted entirely. They may well be 
omitted if, by so doing, more accurate knowledge and better 
understanding result from the detailed study of those topics 
of greater importance. 
By referring again to the topics contained under each unit 
of instruction mentioned above, it will be evident also that 
there is no provision made for associating the events with the 
201 
   
-P-A-G-E-218
ee eee Ce ene 
202 Supervised Study in Besery 
administration of the president during whose term of office 
such events took place. Many teachers who have con- 
scientiously taught all the events related in the text- 
book, under each administration, will, no doubt, feel that 
pupils cannot be well informed unless each event has 
been mentioned. Much depends upon the teacher’s con- 
ception of what he hopes to accomplish with a group 
of children during a definite period. The character of 
the work required will be greatly influenced by the scope 
of vision of each teacher. Pupils may show great skill 
in memorizing facts, and _ still have a very poor under- 
standing of history as a subject. 
Those teachers who have required pupils to study history by 
administrations may recall many baal when they were 
completely discouraged because their pupils seemed to be 
unable to remember whether the telegraph was invented 
during Harrison and Tyler’s administration, or that of James 
K. Polk (or many similar instances). Do not such conditions, 
therefore, result from the fact that a wrong emphasis has 
been placed upon what is important? By such methods, 
the knowledge of events is no longer the means toward 
a better understanding of history, but has become the end. 
These events are thus looked upon as an endless number of 
isolated facts, in which the pupils frequently have little 
interest. Under such conditions, should teachers expect 
pupils to be able to retain all these facts? When ques- 
tions are asked which require more than the retention 
of facts, it is not difficult to deneatdite how very little 
pupils really know. Even those who have been considered 
the brightest pupils often fail when given some question 
requiring reasoning or judgment. |
-P-A-G-E-219
General Statement Concerning Subject Matter 203 
This matter is easily settled when we pause to consider 
what our real aim in teaching any subject must be. Teachers 
who have a keen sense of their responsibility realize that it 
all depends on whether one considers teaching boys and girls 
more important than teaching a countless number of facts, with 
little or no regard to the circumstances under which such 
facts became history. All those who are instilled with the 
former desire will not hesitate to eliminate anything which 
tends to defeat this great purpose. 
The Evaluation of the Subject Matter for an Eight A Grade. 
— Units of instruction XI—XIV inclusive should be taught 
during the latter half of the Eighth year. The length of time 
to be devoted to the study of each unit will depend largely 
upon the amount of detail required in studying each topic. 
Approximately one-fourth of the time might be spent upon 
each unit. Teachers should use their own discretion in 
this matter, however, as some classes require more time than 
others for the completion of a certain portion of subject 
matter. Unit of instruction XII requires careful research and 
organization, and affords an excellent opportunity for the 
collection of a great deal of illustrative material. 
Unit of instruction XIV may look very uninteresting and 
formidable when viewed in an abstract way. It may, how- 
ever, be made as interesting and enjoyable as any work done 
in history, if taught by considering each topic as a present- 
day problem. This means that each problem must be 
closely related to current events. 
Conditions Requiring Special Consideration. — Reference 
to the suggestions and directions embodied in all previous 
lessons outlined in this manual will be of benefit here. The 
suggestions upon the method of procedure during the review 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
  204 Supervised Study in History 
will be found to be even more successful with Eight A pupils 
than with those of previous grades. The ability of these 
children to assume responsibility, exercise initiative, and 
accomplish research work of a more difficult character, de- 
mands that provision must be made to meet the needs in this 
grade. If instruction has been given along the lines of super- 
vised study in each of the three grades preceding the Eight A 
Grade, the power gained by these sh will be of great ad- 
vantage in encountering the situations which arise as the 
work of the semester progresses. 
The statements which have been made in regard to review- 
ing the work of the previous semester en to this grade as   well as to any other. (See pages 96-97.) Many points, 
however, which are outlined under unit of instruction XIV, 
require a consideration of conditions " far back as colonial 
times, or the time when our republican form of government 
was first established. The training dhs pupils in the Eight 
B Grade, through the study of the grey of slavery, will be 
of special value in tracing the development of such questions 
as “ Transportation ”; “ The history of the tariff question ” ; 
or “ The system of banking controlled by our government at 
the present time.” 
LESSON XXVI 
THE INSPIRATIONAL PREVIEW 
Grape — Ercut A 
The Nature of this Preview. — By referring to Lesson I, 
it will be apparent that the suggestions made there are of a 
general character. These are all of importance in any lesson 
of this type given to a new class at the beginning of the 
   
-P-A-G-E-221
  The Inspirational Preview 205 
semester. Some of the specific points pertaining to the par- 
ticular subject matter to be taught in this grade may, how- 
ever, be more definitely explained by means of a concrete 
illustration of the method of procedure advisable in giving a 
preview of the course to an Eight A Grade. 
Method of Procedure. — Begin this lesson by referring to 
the Civil War. Briefly discuss with the pupils the results of 
this war. Allow several pupils to state what each considers 
the most important thing to be accomplished now that the 
study of the war is ended. Tell them that their work for the 
present semester will begin with a consideration of conditions 
existing in the North and in the South directly following the 
close of the war. Ask which section of the country suffered the 
most severe losses and why. Refer to the ordinances of seces- 
sion passed by eleven of the southern states, and help the pupils 
to realize the effect that these ordinances had upon the repre- 
sentation of these states in Congress. In this way, it will be 
made clear to the class that the people of each section had 
many and serious problems to solve. Tell them that their 
first lessons will help them to find out what these problems 
were and how they were solved by the people of that time. 
Encourage the pupils to suggest a title for the first lessons to 
be studied. Such titles as “ Rebuilding the nation,” “ Con- 
ditions in the North and in the South after the Civil War,” 
“ Reorganizing the seceded states,” or similar topics, possibly 
may be given by the pupils. These should be written on the 
board as each is suggested. 
Now very briefly mention any facts pertaining to this first 
unit of instruction to be studied (see unit of instruction XI), 
which will arouse the interest of the pupils. Do not relate 
these facts, — merely mention them in order to help the pupils  
-P-A-G-E-222
         
  206 Supervised Study in History 
  realize some of the interesting things in store for them. Pic- 
tures of the Ku Klux Klan; scenes in some of the southern 
legislatures during the period of “‘ carpet-bag ” government ; 
pictures of certain leaders; or very brief remarks concerning 
any of the events of the times, should be sufficient to give the 
pupils a general idea of some of the principal points worthy of 
consideration. 
Refer to the great points kept constantly in mind during 
the study of the events taught in each preceding grade. These 
were: 
1. The development of civilization. — Seven B Grade. 
2. The development of democratic government. — Seven A 
Grade. 
3. The development of slavery and secession.— Eight B 
Grade. 
Now inform the class that the point for special consideration 
throughout the work of the Eight A Grade will be The gen- 
eral development of the nation. This must be done through 
the study of certain topics. See if the pupils can suggest 
any of the particular lines which seem to require special con- 
sideration. Use any topics which they may suggest, in order 
to outline briefly the following points: 
  THE GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE NATION THROUGH, — 
1. The reconstruction of state and national governments 
(unit of instruction X1). 
2. Transportation and communication (unit of instruc- 
tion XII). 
3. Territorial expansion (unit of instruction XTII). 
4. National issues: (unit of instruction XIV). 
Tariff.  
-P-A-G-E-223
The Inspirational Preview 207 
Banks. 
Trusts. 
Interstate commerce, etc. 
It will not be necessary to attempt to give all of these topics 
at this time. The more important ones should be suggested, 
however, in order that pupils may have an idea of the scope of 
the work. 
Explanation of How to Secure Valuable Material Pertaining 
to These Topics. — If systematic work has been done during 
the study of current events in previous grades, the pupils will 
be greatly interested in the directions given here, and will 
know how to go about securing material. If, however, such 
instruction has not been given, great care should be exercised 
in explaining how this is to be done. 
A plan similar to that outlined under Current Events for 
Eight B pupils (pages 164-171) might be utilized to great 
advantage here. Tell the class that because it is difficult to 
find sufficient material in the textbooks, and since many of the 
questions to be studied are of vital interest at the present time, 
much valuable information may be secured by saving any 
articles found in magazines or newspapers. Now distribute 
several envelopes to each pupil. Each envelope should be 
given a separate label. One might be used for filing all 
clippings relating to the question of “ Tariff’; another for 
“ Trusts ”; a third could be labeled ‘‘ Banks,” while another 
might be used for such topics as “ Civil Service and Inter- 
state Commerce.”’ Topics which will not be given a, great 
amount of detailed study may be combined in this way. One 
envelope thus serves as a file for both. An envelope labeled 
“ Transportation and Communication ” should be used for
-P-A-G-E-224
  208 Supervised Study in History 
filing all pictures which may be used as illustrative material 
to be pasted in the notebooks, when subject matter relating 
to this topic is studied. 
The same simple system for filing these clippings may be 
employed as explained in the directions for filing current-events 
clippings (see pages 168-169). These directions should not 
be given in detail in this lesson, but should be deferred until 
pupils have had time to collect material pertaining to these 
topics. 
Make the purpose of collecting this material very clear 
to the pupils. It will serve as an incentive for the best 
effort. A great deal of enthusiasm will be aroused if a spirit 
of contest is allowed to enter into the collection of such illus- 
trative material. Organize the class into two separate teams, 
boys in one team and girls in another, if the number is ap- 
proximately the same; or, if a teacher has more than one 
Eight A Grade, one section might be allowed to compete with 
another. Prizes are unnecessary. The pupils who accom- 
plish the most in this work will be thoroughly pleased and 
satisfied if their notebooks, when completed, are placed upon 
exhibit in the classroom, and invitations extended to pupils 
and teachers of the History Department, or to the entire 
school, to inspect this work. This is a reward of merit which 
is as greatly appreciated by the pupils as the winning of a prize. 
Recognition of achievement is one of the highest rewards of 
personal endeavor in all walks of life. There seems to be 
no better way to impress this fact upon pupils than to 
provide situations wherein actual experience becomes the 
teacher. 
Conclude this lesson by calling upon several pupils to read 
the topics written upon the several envelopes. which have been 
   
-P-A-G-E-225
  
The Inspirational Preview 209 
prepared. This should be done in order to see that all pupils 
have made the proper provision for each topic. Then ask 
some pupil to explain the use to be made of the clippings 
filed in each envelope. Another pupil might briefly state the 
principal topics or questions to be given special consideration 
during the semester. Dismiss the class after referring again 
to the condition existing in the South at the close of the Civil 
War, and urging each to be ready to suggest some of the great 
problems which confronted both the North and the South 
as a result of the war. 
Results of this Type of Lesson. — The simple plan de- 
scribed above was employed by the author with several 
Eight A classes. The enthusiasm it created resulted in 
a far greater amount of information and a more accurate 
knowledge of these questions being obtained by the pupils 
than had ever been secured previous to the adoption of this 
plan. It served a threefold purpose : 
1. It created enthusiasm and aroused interest in studying 
topics generally considered uninteresting and difficult to 
understand. 
2. It served as an excellent means of stimulating thought 
upon some of the great questions of the day. 
3. It made the boys and girls intelligent concerning many 
national issues of the past and present. 
This was a part of the work required in current events, as 
well as in history, and demonstrates how much the one 
may aid in understanding the other. The habit of reading 
newspapers and magazines, which was developed in this way, 
will be invaluable throughout the lives of these boys and girls. 
It was also interesting and gratifying to see the way the pupils 
carried the interest in this work into the homes. Some pupils 
2 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
  210 Supervised Study in Hisiory 
enlisted the aid of their older brothers and sisters in helping 
them to secure articles upon certain topics. One girl’s uncle 
subscribed for the “ Outlook” for her. American newspapers 
and magazines were purchased in many homes where formerly 
foreign papers only were found. Less fortunate pupils re- 
mained after school at night, in order to ask permission to 
have the morning paper, which was always placed upon the 
reading table for the benefit of the class. The few moments 
before the final bell in the morning or at noon were very 
frequently spent in “ trading ” clippings, which seemed to be 
valued as highly as some of the most treasured possessions 
The teacher derived as much pleasure and benefit from 
this work as the pupils, and all were sorry to have the 
semester end. The chief reason why the pupils seemed so 
enthusiastic over this plan was because they really did the 
work themselves. 
The actual teaching of these topics was very greatly sim- 
plified. Long before the time arrived to make a sys- 
tematic study of a certain topic, the pupils had been made 
conscious of some of the questions requiring research and 
study, because they had been on the alert to discover clip- 
pings upon the topics written on each envelope. After the 
systematic study of each topic had been completed all clip- 
pings collected were pasted in the notebooks following the 
notes upon each one. This made excellent material for 
future reference.

The Review. — Subject Matter. A general summary of 
events previously studied pertaining to the reconstruction of 
the southern states.! 
Method. Previous to the entrance of the class, write 
upon the board a list of the most important questions relat- 
ing to these topics. Number the pupils by groups, each 
group containing as many pupils as there are questions upon 
the board. The final group may be incomplete. The 
pupils of this group may be numbered as far as necessary in 
order to give every pupil a number. 
Direct the time-keeper to allow five minutes of the time for 
1Jt is assumed that as many lessons have been taught as seemed necessary 
to develop a clear understanding of the affairs of vital interest to both North 
and South, during this period of reconstruction. These lessons should have 
covered all important topics leading to and including the impeachment of Presi- 
dent Johnson, as well as the amendments added to the Constitution, 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
  
212 Supervised Study in History 
the first part of the review. This time should be spent by 
each pupil in writing a complete answer to the question cor- 
responding to his number. Sources of information should 
always be quoted in written as well as in oral recitations. 
At the end of the five minutes, all pupils answering Ques- 
tion No. 1 should immediately stand, pass to the front of the 
room, and read their answers in turn to the other members 
of the class, when called upon by the teacher. Other members 
of the class should be ready to stand, and question or correct 
any point at the close of the reading of the last paper written 
upon Question No. 1. A prolonged period of questioning 
is unnecessary, as it might prevent many pupils from reading 
their papers. Neither is it necessary that these answers should 
all be read and discussed in the order in which they appear 
upon the board. At the close of the discussion upon Ques- 
tion No. 1 the teacher might call No. 5, or any other number 
in the list. These pupils should then pass to the front of 
the room while the others are returning to their seats. Any 
errors which the pupils fail to detect should be checked 
by the teacher. Topics which deserve further considera- 
tion should also be noted. The following list of questions 
is typical : 
1. Make a list of the problems, (a) in the North; (6) in the 
South, which faced the people at the beginning of the period 
of reconstruction. 
2. What steps had President Lincoln taken to readjust 
government affairs in certain southern states? 
3- Explain President Johnson’s policy of reconstruction, 
and tell what he did to carry his plan into effect. 
4. Why did Congress disapprove of the President’s 
policy? ‘
-P-A-G-E-229
  
How to Study Lesson 213 
5. What was the purpose of the Civil Rights Bill and the 
Freedmen’s Bureau? Explain each. 
6. Write an account of the dispute between Congress and 
the President at this time. 
7. Why was President Johnson impeached? 
8. Explain the meaning of “impeachment,” and give an 
account of the impeachment of President Johnson. 
9. Do you consider it fortunate or unfortunate that Presi- 
dent Johnson was acquitted by the Senate? Give reasons 
for your answer. 
zo. What amendments were added to the Constitution to 
protect the future of the negroes? Briefly state the provision 
of each amendment. 
The Assignment.—1. Brief explanation given by the 
teacher. 
2. The recognition and statement of the problem. 
3. References pertaining to the problem determined, and a 
codperative assignment made. 
Brief explanation given by the teacher. Direct the atten- 
tion of the class to the length of time which elapsed while 
these events just related were taking place. Help them 
to realize that a period of nearly fifteen years intervened 
from the time of Lincoln’s Amnesty Proclamation until Presi- 
dent Hayes removed the troops from the South and the 
period of reconstruction was considered at an end. Now 
refer again to the condition existing in the southern states 
at the close of the war, and ask the pupils to attempt to 
state the next problem which must be considered before we 
can thoroughly understand all that “ reconstruction” meant. 
The recognition and statement of the problem. The 
few statements and questions referred to above will lead the
-P-A-G-E-230
  
214 Supervised Study in History 
pupils to realize that we must now consider the effect upon the 
South during the time that Congress and the President were 
disagreeing over what was to be done. Any statement similar 
to the following will serve as a motive for further study of this 
question : | 
The Problem: What was happening in the South during 
the period of reconstruction? 
References pertaining to the problem determined, and a 
codperative assignment made. Using the following texts 
as illustration, allow the pupils to consult the index of each, 
and determine the page references which contain any informa- 
tion relating to the problem. The title of the book and the 
reference found in each should be written upon the board. 
Bassett, ‘‘ The Plain Facts of American History,” pp. 390- 
304. Mace, “‘ School History of the United States,” pp. 391-394. 
Dickson, “ American History for Grammar Schools,” 
pp. 460-464. 
After these references have been ce. the pupils 
should discover for themselves what topics are to be studied. 
Using Bassett’s text as a reference, the title of the chapter 
should be read. All marginal notes should then be given 
attention. This might be done by calling upon a pupil to 
rise and read the marginal notes found in the chapter. These 
should be written upon the board by the teacher as each is 
read. They would then appear as follows: 
The Problem: What was happe in the South during 
the period of reconstruction? 
1. The feeling of the South. 
2. Ku Klux Klan: 
a. Its origin. 
 
-P-A-G-E-231
  
How to Study Lesson 215 
6. Its visits. 
c. Its severity. 
3. Carpet-baggers and scalawags. 
4. Overthrow of the negro voters. 
Mace’s text should next be consulted in order to see if 
other topics might be added to this list. The pupils should 
be encouraged to decide whether any topics should be added. 
This decision might result in such topics as the following 
being selected : 
1. Negro rule in the South. 
2. Results of carpet-bag and negro rule. 
3. The Fifteenth Amendment. 
A brief glance at the marginal notes in Dickson’s text will 
result in the possible selection of: 1. Military rule in the 
South. (‘Legislatures in reconstructed states” and “ Ex- 
confederates restored to political rights, 1872,” should not be 
considered as additional topics, as the pupils will find that 
they coincide with topics already noted.) 
Now by questions and suggestions, the teacher and pupils 
working together should reorganize the topics written upon the 
board, in order to secure a more logical outline. This, when 
completed, would resemble the following : 
The Problem: What was happening in the South during 
the period of reconstruction? 
1. Military rule in the South. (D., pp. 460-46r.) 
2. The feeling of the South. (B., p. 392.) 
3. Negro rule in the South. (M., pp. 391-392.) 
4. Carpet-baggers and scalawags. (All histories.) 
5. The results of carpet-bag and negro rule. (M., pp. 392- 
393-) 
6. The Ku Klux Klan. (B., pp. 390-393; also M. & D.)

3. Copy the paragraph or part of the paragraph found in

this law, and with what results? 
ITI or Maximum Assignment. 
5. The remainder of the period may be spent in the library, 
reading as much as you can from the following references: 
Woodrow Wilson, “A History of the American People” 
(Harper & Co.), Vol. V, pp. 46-49, 59-64. 
Burgess, “‘ Reconstruction ” (Scribner’s), pp. 247-249, 261- 
264. 
Thomas Nelson Page, ‘‘ Red Rock ” (Scribner’s). 
Verification. — The teacher’s time during this study period 
might be devoted to seeing that pupils are using the right 
methods of study. Little help will be needed unless there is 
evidence of some misunderstanding. Very little time will be 
required to accomplish the average assignment. It is merely 
a “test ” of the kind of reading done by the pupils. Those 
who fail to locate the reference rh show that thoughtful 
reading has not been done. Any time remaining after deter- 
   
-P-A-G-E-233

mining the number of pupils working on each part of the 
assignment might be spent in discussing this point with the 
class. 
Always collect all written work. Careless habits will result 
if this is neglected. Urge the pupils to save any pictures or 
other illustrative material which may be found concerning any 
of the events studied under the period of reconstruction.

Method. The two articles mentioned above should be 
read to the class by the teacher. The first article is particu- 
1 See Hart’s “ Romances of the Civil War” (Macmillan), pp. 41-44 and pp. 
93-97. 
 
-P-A-G-E-234
           
   218 Supervised Study in History 
larly valuable in picturing the lack of industries other than 
agriculture throughout the southern states before the Civil 
War. This will help the pupils to realize the need for a com- 
plete reorganization of southern industries after the war. 
This account should be discussed both during the reading 
and after it is finished. Encourage the pupils to ask questions 
about any point. A better understanding concerning the 
industrial situation will result from the reading of this article, 
and the pupils will be better prepared to give intelligent assist- 
ance during the assignment. 
The second article very vividly portrays the conditions 
existing in the South in regard to educating the “‘ freedmen.” 
Aside from the human touch which the pupils will so greatly 
enjoy, it will help to make them more conscious of the great 
need of a better system of education, both for the negroes and 
the poorer class of white people in the South. 
Material of this character introduces an element of variation 
into the review, thereby relieving the continuous recital of 
facts. Such articles, if carefully chosen, often make more 
lasting impressions of actual conditions than a review period 
devoted entirely to the discussion of facts previously studied. 
There is slight danger that time will be wasted when spent in 
considering this type of subject matter, provided the teacher 
has a particular purpose in introducing it at any certain point 
during the study of a question under consideration. 
The chief purpose of introducing these articles in this 
lesson is to prepare the class for the assignment to be made 
upon the “ New South.” | 
The Assignment.—1. Realization and statement of the 
new problem. 
2. Codperative assignment and selection of references. 
   
-P-A-G-E-235
  An Inductive Lesson 219 . 
Realization and statement of the new problem. ‘The re- 
view described above has made the pupils conscious that 
a complete reorganization of southern affairs was necessary as 
a result of the Civil War. With this in mind, question the 
class to determine what is considered the most important 
problem for study, in order to understand how a new pros- 
perity for the South was brought about. 
Under ordinary conditions there will be little difficulty in 
securing the statement of such a problem as: Along what 
lines did the South develop after the Civil War in order to be 
called the ‘‘ New South”? 
Coéperative assignment and selection of references. In 
organizing this work, the teacher should draw upon the 
general information that the pupils already have as a result of 
their study of geography, as well as any information gained 
from sources other than the textbook. Through questions, 
suggestions, directions, and brief statements wherever neces- 
sary, a simple outline should be developed and written upon 
the board. Pupils of this grade are capable of doing such work 
if properly directed. The following is suggestive of what is 
meant by a simple outline: 
The Problem: Along what lines did the South develop after 
the Civil War in order to be called the “ New South”? 
I. Development of Industries. 
1. Improved methods in agriculture. 
2. Development of mining and natural resources. 
(a) Coal. 
(6) Iron ore. 
(c) Petroleum and natural gas. 
(d) Water power.  
-P-A-G-E-236
    220 Supervised Study in History 
3- Development of lumbering. 
(a) Products from the pine forests. 
4. Development of manufacturing. 
(a) Cotton factories. 
(b) Iron and steel factories, etc. 
5. Development of commerce. 
(a) By land and water. 
(0) Domestic and foreign. 
II. Development of Population. 
1. Immigration to the South. 
(a) From foreign countries. 
(0) From different sections of the United States. 
2. Effect of southern immigration. 
(a) New cities built. 
(b) Old cities rebuilt and improved. 
III. Development of Education. 
1. For the “ freedmen.” 
2. For the “ poor whites.” 
3. New colleges and institutions for higher education. 
The above outline is copied from a notebook belonging to a 
pupil of an Eight A Grade. The work was prepared by a class 
taught by the author. Very little assistance was given in the 
preparation of this outline. The statements were written on 
the board as suggested by the pupils. These were later 
reorganized. The outline submitted in this lesson shows the 
form approved by the class, as a result of the reorganization 
of the statements suggested. It is imperfect in many ways, 
but it served to impress the need of an orderly, systematic 
arrangement of ideas pertaining to the question as a whole,
-P-A-G-E-237

before beginning a detailed, study of the parts of this unit of 
recitation. 
After thecompletion of this outline, textbooks were consulted 
for references upon all topics included in the outline. (Only 
those references should be studied in this lesson which refer 
to the first topic.) References such as the following were 
selected and written on the board opposite the topic in the 
outline to which each referred : 
Beard-Bagley, “The History of the American People,” 
Chap. XXIII. 
Mace, “ School History of the United States,” pp. 428-434. 
Bourne & Benton, “ History of the United States,” pp. 475- 
482.

PP. 351-353- Dickson, “American History for Grammar Schools,” 
pp. 488-491. 
Study of the Assignment. — JI or Minimum Assignment. 
1. Read all references found upon the first topic in the out- 
line (“‘ The Development of Industries ’’), and be able to give 
a complete discussion of this question in to-morrow’s review. 
2. Copy in your notebooks the outline prepared and written 
upon the board, during the assignment. 
IT or Average Assignment. 
3. Read the first phrase, in the first sentence of the first 
paragraph, under Chapter XLII (Bourne & Benton). Turn 
to the index and see if you can locate any cross-reference upon 
the “failure of the plantation system.” If any is found 
read it carefully, and then write a statement showing the 
paragraph heading and the page where this reference is found. 
4. Write a paragraph explaining the demand for more rail-

roads in the South, as a result of the rapid changes brought 
about after the Civil War. 
III or Maximum Assignment. | 
5. Consult the geographies and railroad guides upon the 
reading table, and then write on the board a list of the prin- 
cipal railway lines of the South at the present time. 
Verification. — Pupils who have not reached the average 
assignment will derive benefit from listening to those who have 
accomplished the work. Any one of the successful pupils of 
the average group should be called upon to explain to the class 
exactly what he did in answering No. II, 3. In giving this 
explanation, the pupil should first read the directions on the 
board, and then explain how he found the proper reference. 
This should be read to prove the success of his efforts. Work 
of this character tests the pupil’s ability to follow directions 
accurately. 
Suggestions for Subsequent Lessons upon this Problem. — 
Lesson XXVIII should be followed by one or more lessons! 
upon topics IT and III of the outline prepared in the previous 
lesson (‘Development of Population” and “ Development of 
Education”). The latter topic affords an excellent oppor- 
tunity for the pupils to gain information about Hampton and 
: Tuskegee Institutes, and such leaders among the colored race 
as Booker T. Washington, Major Robert R. Moton, and 
Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois. 
The study of unit of instruction XI should be concluded by 
a Socialized Lesson, for the purpose of reviewing all important 
facts discovered and studied during the time devoted to the 
consideration of the great events outlined under this unit of 
instruction.

Method. A longer period than fifteen minutes for this 
kind of review is unnecessary. Only a few moments should 
be required to direct the attention of the class to the new 
topic requiring consideration. In order to do this, a very 
brief program might be written upon the board containing 
items similar to the following : 
1. What were the routes followed by the “ forty-niners ” 
in their efforts to reach the gold fields of California? 
2. Compare the method of crossing the continent at that 
time with modern methods. 
3. ‘What Crops may we Expect,” from the “ Independ- 
ent,” May 19, 1917, page 322. (Previously assigned to some 
pupil.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-240

5. ‘ Our $6,000,000,000 Trade,” from the ‘‘ Independent,” 
June 9, 1917, page 457. 
Certain pupils should be called upon for brief statements 
concerning Numbers 1 and 2; Numbers 3, 4, and 5 should be 
reported upon by pupils to whom such articles ! were assigned. 
A short discussion should follow the recitation upon each 
number. This should be sufficient to arouse an interest in the 
question of Transportation. 
The Assignment.—1. A consideration of the value of 
transportation to the home community. 
2. The meaning of the words “ transportation ” and “ com- 
munication ” developed. 
3. The statement of the problem. 
4. How to begin to solve the problem, made clear to the class. 
A consideration of the value of transportation to the home 
community. Ask the pupils to state the means of transpor- 
tation in the community in which they live; also the ways in 
which this community is connected with the outside world. 
Do not go into detail upon this point. Simply call the atten- 
tion of the class to the various means of transportation com- 
mon to the particular community. Now, ask some pupil to 
state the effect upon the community, if these various means 
were suddenly destroyed. This will help to impress the fact 
that any community is dependent upon its various systems of| 
transportation for its existence and development.      
           
    
         
   1 It is not intended that teachers should use the articles referred to above. 
They are cited only for the purpose of illustration. Material should be use: 
which is particularly adapted to the conditions existing at the time the stud. 
of this topic is begun. To introduce such topics successfully, the ingenuit; 
of the individual teacher is required.

                                             The meaning of the words “ transportation” and “ communica- 
tion.” Dictionaries should be consulted and the meaning 
of each word carefully studied. This will bring out the point 
of transportation by land and by water (if this has not already 
been emphasized when considering the means of transportation 
in the community). 
The statement of the problem. By referring to condi- 
tions in the home community before the days of modern 
methods of transportation, and by questioning the pupils 
concerning the changes resulting from improved conditions, 
help them to realize that the development of transportation 
has had an influence upon the development of the home com- 
munity. By allowing pupils who have lived in other centers 
to state the methods of transportation in those places, make 
it evident that the smaller communities form the nation. This 
will enable them to state such a problem as : — How has the 
development of transportation and communication influenced 
the development of the nation? 
How to begin to solve the problem, made clear to the class. 
Inform the class, at this point, that in order to understand 
how the development of transportation and communication 
has influenced the development of the nation, we must begin 
with the study of the development of transportation and 
communication themselves. The kinds of transportation (by 
water and by land) should be written upon the board, and the 
terms “ early methods ” and “‘ modern methods ” written after 
each. The pupils should now decide which was the most com- 
mon method in early colonial days and why. This will lead 
to collection of data pertaining to Early methods of transpor- 
tation by water. Such data should be collected during the 
study period.

1. Using the texts upon your desk, consult the index of 
each for references upon “ Early methods of transportation 
by water.” Read carefully only those statements which 
pertain to transportation by water. 
2. As each text is consulted, write in simple outline form 
all topics which will help to give a more definite idea of this 
subject. 
3. Reorganize the topics listed under each text into one 
complete outline. Conclude this work by listing all references 
found.

Verification. — During the study period, the teacher may 
find it necessary to help pupils who appear to be having 
difficulty in locating references. It is probable that all pupils 
will not find each reference listed in this lesson. Some out- 
lines will, therefore, be more complete than others. The 
teacher’s attention should largely be given to the inferior 
group in lessons of this character. 
During the few minutes for verification, any pupil of this 
group who has succeeded in making a satisfactory outline 
might be allowed to read this to the class. Each pupil should 
check all points in his own outline which are similar to the 
ones read. These will be given careful consideration during 
the review upon the following day. The envelope in which 
pupils have been directed to file all pictures found previous 
to this lesson should be referred to, and the class should be 
shown how all other pictures which may be found will help to 
illustrate the work upon this topic.

The Review. — Subject Matter.— Early methods of trans- 
portation by water. (Discovered in the preceding lesson.) 
Method. — The individual outlines prepared independently 
by the pupils during the study of the assignment of the previous 
lesson should be used in organizing a codperative outline, which 
should be written upon the board by the teacher or by one of 
the pupils. 
Begin this work by calling upon a Heol who prepared a 
satisfactory outline during the study of the previous day’s 
assignment, to read this outline to the class. Discuss the 
principal points of the outline, and gain the decision of the 
entire class concerning the first topic to be written in the out- 
line upon the board. Other topics should be added by per- 
mitting the pupils to suggest each point. This work needs
-P-A-G-E-245
  
An Inductive-Deductive Lesson 229 
very close supervision and strong control. Do not allow 
pupils to volunteer information in unison, as confusion and 
disorder frequently result. This wastes time. Direct the 
pupils to volunteer suggestions by raising the hand or rising. 
When recognized by the teacher, the contribution should be 
offered. Only a brief statement should be given. If this 
statement is accepted by the class, it should be included in 
the outline. 
Insist upon all pupils forming an opinion upon the points 
submitted. They should either agree or disagree. Those 
who disagree then may be led easily to see why they are wrong. 
Occasionally a point contributed may receive the approval of 
the majority of the class, and yet be incorrect. Books should 
be consulted in this case, and the whole class set right. Again, 
a pupil may contribute some item that the majority of the 
class failed to find. This pupil should be required to prove 
his point by referring to the text in which it was found. This 
statement should be read by the entire class, and if then 
accepted should be included in the outline. This reference 
may then be noted as well as all others. Encourage pupils of 
the inferior group to make all the contributions they can. 
This helps to give them the feeling of having had a part in 
the work. 
Not more than two thirds of the time for the review should 
be spent in organizing this material. The remainder of the 
time should be devoted to determining how thoroughly the 
pupils have acquired the important facts relating to the subject 
matter read during the study period of the previous day. Any 
topic found to be poorly prepared should be written upon the 
board. This should be reviewed during the first part of the 
study period. Work of this character enables the teacher to 
es  
-P-A-G-E-246
230 Supervised Study in History 
discover if the pupils are gaining power to do independent 
work in a systematic way. This knowledge will be of benefit 
in the study to be done during the assignment, as well as in all 
subsequent lessons. 
The Assignment. — A Codperative Assignment. In order 
to save time and to apply the principles emphasized during 
the review, the teacher and pupils working together should 
discover and prepare in outline form the important topics of 
interest in securing a definite knowledge of Modern methods 
of transportation by water. 
The pupils will see readily that this must be the next step, 
and that the problem under consideration will not be solved 
until all available information relating to transportation and 
communication has been collected and examined. (See 
topics under unit of instruction XII.) The general knowledge 
which the pupils may have upon Modern methods of transpor- 
tation should be utilized, as well as information from texts 
selected for this purpose. 
At the beginning of this work, do not attempt to make any 
carefully organized outline. Simply write a word or two upon 
the board to represent each statement of value given by the 
pupils. When sufficient data have been collected, a systematic 
arrangement should then be made, and references noted wher- 
ever possible. Topics requiring further research outside of 
school should have enough space reserved to insert other 
references later, when found by individual members of 
the class. Topics of current interest which will later be 
among important historical facts should be referred to and 
included in this outline. It is well also to urge the pupils 
to insert any topic later discovered as a result of collateral 
reading.
-P-A-G-E-247
  An Inductive-Deductive Lesson 231 
Errors to be avoided. — There is one grave danger in this 
kind of work which should constantly be kept in mind by the 
teacher. Great care should be exercised in order that this 
work in outlining subject matter may not be carried to an 
extreme. A great deal of the subject matter suggested 
under units of instruction XI-XIV is particularly adapted 
to organization of this kind. If this is carried to excess, 
however, the notebook work becomes the end, rather than 
the'means. The outlines never should be so long and com- 
plicated that it will require the greater part of the period to 
prepare them, thus leaving insufficient time in which to be- 
come thoroughly posted upon the facts themselves. Notes 
of this character are of little value unless they have served 
as the means of giving the pupils a more intelligent under- 
standing of the events studied. 
The Study of the Assignment.— I or Minimum Assignment. 
1. Copy in your notebook the outline upon the board, pre- 
pared during the review. Follow this by the one prepared 
during the assignment. 
2. Review any topics not thoroughly studied yesterday. 
3. Read all references given upon the topics contained in 
the outline upon “ Modern methods of transportation by 
water.” 
4. Tell briefly what must be accomplished before this 
problem will be solved. 
IT or Average Assignment. 
5. Refer to pp. 366-367 of Bourne & Benton’s “ History 
of the United States” for an account of the “ clipper ships ” 
built in America about the middle of the nineteenth century. 
6. What use has recently been made of this type of ship? 
(Written work.)
-P-A-G-E-248
  232 Supervised Study in History 
III or Maximum Assignment (written work). 
4. Briefly describe a journey you have made by water, or 
a visit to a great ocean liner or a war vessel. 
Verification. — After determining the number working upon 
each part of the assignment, refer to No. 6, under the average 
assignment, in order to determine how many pupils have any 
information upon this point. If this number is in the minority, 
a few statements made by the teacher will add interest and 
encourage pupils to attempt to secure a picture of a “ clipper 
ship.” Before dismissing the class, determine the number 
who have secured pictures to use as illustrative material. 
This should be done at frequent intervals in order to recognize 
and encourage effort along this line. i 
Suggestions for Subsequent Lessons upon Unit of Instruc- 
tion XII.—At least two lessons should be devoted to the study 
of Canals as supplements to natural water routes. (See unit of 
instruction XII.) More time could be spent to good advan- 
tage upon this topic, as there are many things concerning both 
the Erie Canal and the Panama Canal which might be studied 
with profit. 
A socialized review upon the ‘‘ Development of transporta- 
tion by water ” should precede the work upon “ Transporta- 
tion by land.” The study of this unit of recitation will 
require the same careful, systematic research as the preceding 
topics. This should be followed by a consideration of the 
“Methods of communication” and other topics suggested 
under this unit of instruction. An entire period should then 
be given to a Review Lesson, the first part of the period 
being devoted to a socialized review upon the question of 
transportation, in order to determine whether the problem 
may be considered solved. The pupils then might be per-
-P-A-G-E-249
    An Inductive-Deductive Lesson 233 
mitted to spend the remainder of the period in pasting in their 
notebooks all illustrative material pertaining to this question. 
A Red Letter Day Lesson should conclude the study of 
this unit of instruction. The notebooks should be exhibited 
in this lesson. An interesting feature with which to conclude 
the lesson is to have each member rise as his name is called, 
and briefly state the value of good systems of transportation 
to himself or any member of his family. Many of these 
statements may be amusing, but they help to prove how 
thoroughly the pupils realize the importance of this question, 
not only to the nation, but to the individual as well. 
The Power Gained by the Pupils from this Method of Study. 
— Pupils know exactly what must be studied, also just what 
is ahead of them in the solution of a problem. This tends 
to secure systematic habits of study, which pupils of any age 
need to acquire. Although the teacher has skillfully controlled 
the work, the pupils feel that they have done the greater part 
for themselves. This always has the effect of inspiring one 
to make greater effort because of the confidence in one’s self 
which results from having successfully accomplished an 
undertaking. 
The great field of current literature becomes intelligible to 
many boys and girls who might never be aroused to an appre- 
ciation of this or any other line of reading unless a situation is 
provided by means of which right habits will be formed, and 
enjoyment found in reading and studying along these lines. 
An extract from a notebook belonging toa pupil of an 
Eight A Grade is submitted here as an illustration of the 
amount and kind of reading voluntarily done outside of 
school, during the study of the subject of transportation. 
This does not include any texts used in class or any of the

collateral reading placed at the disposal of the pupils. Since 
this pupil came from a home where conditions were most un- 
favorable for this kind of training, the reading accomplished 
by this child suggests the great possibilities open to teacher 
and pupils alike.

The Review. — Subject Matter. The extent and names of 
the thirteen original states; also the states formed from the 
Northwest Territory. 
Method. Five or ten minutes of the time for review might 
be spent by having the pupils recall by writing, without the 
aid of a text, the names of the thirteen original states, to- 
gether with the states later formed from the Northwest Ter- 
ritory. At the end of this time, one of these papers might 
be read. The teacher might write the list of states upon 
the board in the same form as given by the pupil. Now call 
upon another pupil to go to the board and make any addi- 
tions or corrections to the list given by the first pupil. 
If this list is still incorrect or incomplete, permit any member 
of the class who recognizes an error, or can add any state not 
given, to stand. These pupils should be called upon, in turn, 
until the correct list of states is secured.

    Maps should then be consulted, and the portion of the 
United States occupied by these states should be carefully 
reviewed. A comparison of the original area with the present 
area should then be made. This will result in the pupils 
recognizing their problem for the new work. 
The Assignment.—1. Recognition of the new problem. 
2. Present knowledge concerning the problem, determined 
and tested. 
3. Exposition given by the teacher. 
Recognition of the new problem. The comparison of the 
present area of the United States with the original area 
of the thirteen states at the close of the Revolutionary War 
will lead the pupils to question how our present territory 
has been obtained. Asa result of studying about the slavery 
question in Texas and California, the pupils already have 
a general knowledge of how some of the territory was 
acquired. 
Although this knowledge is indefinite and disconnected, 
when viewed in the light of “ National Expansion” it 
will aid the pupils to realize that the present area of the 
United States is the result of a gradual expansion through 
acquisition. A problem similar to the following may then 
be stated: 
How has the United States acquired the territory which she 
now owns? 
Present knowledge concerning the problem determined and 
tested. The pupils will be very eager to prove that they 
already have a great deal of knowledge upon this subject. 
Ask all who know of some territory acquired by the United 
States, to stand. Call upon the pupils of the inferior group 
who have something to suggest. Permit these pupils to make
-P-A-G-E-254
ee ere renee er nnn ere ees 
238 Supervised Study in History 
their contributions first. Pupils of the average and superior 
groups might then supplement the statements made by the 
weaker pupils. The territory mentioned by the pupils might 
be written upon the board by the teacher. No attempt should 
be made to arrange this material in the order of acquisition. 
Merely note what the pupils submit in the order in which 
it is contributed. As each statement is given, question the 
class upon some point which probably will be unfamiliar to 
the greater majority of the class. This will convince them 
of the necessity of further research. The teacher should also 
help them to realize that the present information upon 
the subject is insufficient to solve the problem, because it is 
so incomplete. Territory not mentioned by the class might 
be referred to by the teacher, in order to give the pupils an 
idea of the extent of this work. They should also recog- 
nize that the best way to gain a thorough knowledge of this 
question is to study the facts pertaining to each acquisition 
of territory in the order in which it was acquired. The topic, 
therefore, which requires special study in this lesson is the 
Purchase of Louisiana. 
Exposition given by the teacher. Before the pupils begin 
the independent study of this topic, it will be better under- 
stood if an explanation is made concerning the situation pre- 
vious to this purchase. It should be made plain to the 
class how France ceded New Orleans and all her territory 
west of the Mississippi to Spain, at the close of the French and 
Indian War. Maps should be used to show the importance 
of the river to the settlers west of the Allegheny Mountains. 
This will be partly familiar as a result of having studied about 
the flat boats, — one of the early methods of transportation. 
Relate how America secured permission to ship her western

An Expository Lesson 239 
produce from New Orleans; how this privilege was later dis- 
continued, and with what results. This will give the pupils 
a better idea of the situation which culminated in the purchase 
of the entire territory. Since the pupils will discover for 
themselves how it happened that this territory was purchased 
from France instead of Spain, this point should not be ex- 
plained in the exposition given by the teacher. If pupils 
raise this question, the answer should be deferred until the few 
moments for verification at the close of the period. Only a 
brief time should be devoted to this exposition, which should 
be directly followed by the study period. 
Study of the Assignment.— I or Minimum Assignment. 
1. Find two reasons why Jefferson was anxious to gain 
control of New Orleans. 
2. How did it happen that Napoleon Bonaparte had the 
right to sell New Orleans?

difficulty in regard to why it was possible to buy Louisiana 
from France, this point might be given brief consideration at 
this time. 
Some pupil who has completed the minimum assignment 
should be selected to draw a map upon the board. This 
map should be made to illustrate each acquisition of territory 
within the boundaries of the United States. It should show 
only the thirteen original states, the Northwest Territory 
and the Louisiana Purchase, as a result of this lesson. Addi- 
tions should be made as the study of the problem progresses. 
Suggestions for Other Lessons upon Unit of Instruction 
XIII.—It is difficult to estimate the number of lessons 
required in considering this unit of instruction. Some classes 
accomplish the work more quickly than others. As many] 
lessons should be given upon each unit of recitation as ar 
found to be necessary, if pupils are to obtain any lasting impres+ 
sions concerning the question of National Expansion. As eac 
topic is studied, the value of such territory to the Unite 
States should be constantly kept in mind.

In studying the unit of recitation dealing with the territory 
acquired from Spain after the Spanish-American War, the 
war itself should be given only such consideration as seems 
necessary to understand the causes and results. Newspaper 
and magazine clippings will aid in illustrating the topics to 
be studied during the latter part of this work. The final unit 
of recitation, The Purchase of the Danish West I ndies, can be 
studied only through securing clippings from recent periodicals.

The Review. — Subject Matter. A consideration of some 
of the clippings relating to Tariff, which previously have 
been collected and filed in the envelope prepared for that

Method. The pupils should have been informed upon 
the preceding day that these clippings would be considered 
during the time for review in the next lesson. This gives 
them an opportunity to look over the material they have

collected and to select an item upon which they wish 
to report. 
These reports might be given in the following manner. 
Permit the class to elect a conductor and a recorder. The 
conductor should take his place in front of the class, while the 
recorder should pass to the blackboard. Inform each of these 
pupils concerning his particular responsibility. The conductor 
should call upon any member of the class to contribute an 
item. The pupil called upon should pass to the front of the 
room, inform the class concerning the source of information, 
read the heading of the article by way of designating the 
particular topic, and then briefly give the report. (This 
should not be read.) When the report is finished, this pupil 
should have the privilege of asking any question about the 
contents of his article which puzzles him, or about which he 
desires more information. If the question is a minor one, it 
should be answered quickly by the teacher. If, however, the 
questioner raises some point which will be given special con- 
sideration during the study of the subject of tariff, the re- 
corder should be directed by the teacher to write this question 
upon the board. The class should then be given the same 
privilege to question upon any point. These questions should 
receive the same treatment. A normal class of boys and girls 
of the Eight A Grade will ask many questions in regard to 
matters which they do not understand. The most important 
of these, written upon the board by the recorder, will serve 
as an excellent incentive for beginning the study of a subject 
frequently looked upon, by pupils and teacher alike, as diffi- 
cult and uninteresting. 
As many pupils should be called upon by the conductor as 
the time will permit. Although these may be comparatively
-P-A-G-E-259
  An Habituation Lesson 243 
few, because of the number of questions asked, the interest of 
the pupils in the subject may be aroused in this way. They 
then will enter into a detailed study of facts with much more 
enthusiasm than would have been secured if a subject of 
this character were introduced in the usual formal, abstract 
way. 
Points overlooked by the pupils, because of their lack of 
knowledge upon the subject, should be mentioned by the 
teacher, who might state these ideas in the form of questions. 
When the pupils realize their inability to answer such ques- 
tions, these also should be added to the list on the board. 
Conclude this review by directing the recorder to read the 
questions recorded during this part of the period. Call the 
attention of the class to the value they have already found 
in the clippings collected, and help them to decide how they 
can gain sufficient information to answer successfully the 
questions upon the board. 
The Assignment. — 1. References read by the teacher. 
2. Summary of the important points which have been 
emphasized during the review and the assignment. 
References read by the teacher. Many of the questions 
recorded upon the board may be of such a character that the 
pupils will need direction in determining the answers. 
The Constitution of the United States should first be con- 
sulted, in order to determine why tariff is necessary, and by 
whom it is controlled. These are two questions always asked 
by pupils who are doing purposive thinking, during the con- 
sideration of the current-event clippings discussed at the 
beginning of the lesson. Article I, Sections 7, 8, 9, and 10 
should be referred to, and such portions as pertain to the 
question of tariff read by the teacher. This may answer   
     
-P-A-G-E-260
  244 Supervised Study in History 
some of the questions asked by the pupils during the review, 
but it will also raise additional questions which may not have 
been included among the others. 
Since no information has been given in regard to the mean- 
ing of tariff, excises, revenue, etc., any new term should be 
added to the list upon the board, while questions considered 
as answered might be checked by the teacher. The pupils 
now have been led to realize the need for more direct in- 
formation concerning some of the terms and questions which 
have proved so puzzling. They therefore should be directed 
to give careful consideration to the statements read by the 
teacher. Each pupil should take notes on all points which 
impress him as important, or which give direct information 
upon any of the questions and terms written upon the board. 
Boynton’s “ Actual Government of New York’’1 is suggested 
as a reference which might be read to the class. The teacher 
should pause from time to time, in order to question the pupils 
upon the meaning of some term, to explain a statement, or 
to answer a question asked by a pupil. It is advisable also 
to call upon a pupil to read the notes he has written upon any 
of the points read or discussed by the teacher. This will 
test whether the pupils are recognizing and noting the most 
important facts. 
In discussing the meaning of the term “ excises,” attention 
should be called to the excise or internal revenue stamps found 
upon certain commodities. The pupils should be permitted 
to name all articles upon which they have seen these stamps. 
A pupil might be delegated to find information concerning the 
manner in which the government controls the collection of 
internal revenue. This report should be given during the 
1 Ginn & Co., Chapter XX, pp. 225-229.

review upon the following day. Encourage all pupils to 
collect revenue stamps, and note the article upon which each 
stamp is found. This latter makes a very interesting page 
in the notebook. 
Summary of the important points which have been emphasized 
during the review and the assignment. The pupils should now 
be called upon to state all points which were given special 
consideration during the review and the assignment. These 
might be noted upon the board by the teacher. Pupils 
may thus check their own judgment in regard to what each 
thought was important. Conclude the assignment by devot- 
ing a few moments to allowing the pupils to ask questions upon 
any of the points summarized, concerning which they are 
uncertain. These questions might be answered by the teacher 
or any pupil who volunteers to answer ; while pupils requiring 
special attention might be given the necessary assistance 
during the study period. 
The Study of the Assignment. — I or Minimum Assign- 
ment. Review all notes written during the assignment, also 
try to recall all topics discussed during the review and the 
assignment. Then answer the following questions: 
1. What is tariff? 
2. Name the two kinds of taxes and explain the difference 
between them. 
3. By what division of government are direct taxes levied? 
Who really pays the indirect taxes? 
4. What direct tax has recently been levied by our national 
government, and how was this made possible? 
5. What kinds of revenue tariff were discussed during this 
lesson? Explain each. 
6. Why is tariff necessary to any successful government?

7. Which do you consider more important, — revenue 
tariff or protective tariff? Why? 
8. When did our nation first require a revenue tariff and 
why? 
II or Average Assignment. 
9. Refer to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Federal Con- 
stitution, and study its contents. Then state what power 
was granted to Congress as a result of this amendment. 
III or Maximum Assignment. 
io. Write a brief paragraph telling how and where tariff is 
collected ; or 
People entering our ports from foreign countries must have 
all baggage inspected by Custom House officers. Why is this 
necessary? If you have ever seen this done, give a brief 
description of your experience. 
Verification. — The brief time remaining at the close of the 
study period might be spent in allowing the pupils to state 
which question or questions seemed the most difficult. Select 
the one generally considered difficult, and help the pupils to 
understand this more fully. All papers should be collected in 
order to determine the kind of work accomplished by each, 
and the topics requiring special consideration upon the next 
day. Urge the pupils to bring to class any new clippings 
relating to the question of tariff. 
Suggestions for Further Lessons upon this Unit of Recita- 
tion. — The review upon the following day will determine 
whether more drill should be given at this time upon any point 
considered essential for an intelligent study of the question of 
tariff, or whether new work may be attempted. If the class 
is ready to undertake new work, question No. 8 in the mini- 
mum assignment should receive sufficient attention to impress   
     
-P-A-G-E-263
  An Habituation Lesson 247 
the fact that the need for a revenue tariff began when our 
government was first established under the present Constitu- 
tion. A brief consideration of why revenue tariff is needed 
to-day will then enable the pupils to realize that the question 
of tariff, like the question of slavery or any other important 
national issue, has undergone many gradual changes to meet 
the need of existing conditions. A problem then may be 
stated which will require a study of the history of tariff from 
1789 until the present time. This might be: 
“What have been the conditions under which the tariff 
question has been one of the great problems before the 
people?” 
A careful study of Hamilton’s financial policy and its re- 
sults then should be made. This will require a careful con- 
sideration of the circumstances which made the first protective 
tariff necessary. The history of the protective tariff, culmi- 
nating in the nullification of South Carolina and the final 
settlement of the tariff question at that time, affords the 
class an opportunity to study subject matter which may be- 
come alive with interest. 
The tariff question from 1842 to 1860 needs only a general 
consideration. The study of this unit of recitation should be 
concluded by giving special attention to the tariff question as 
a present-day issue.. Current events should play an impor- 
tant part here. An occasional socialized recitation will help 
to review the facts and keep the important ideas before the 
minds of the pupils. 
A very satisfactory way of providing for a socialized review 
with pupils of an Eight A Grade is to direct each one to pre- 
pare a list of questions. These should have been written 
during the study period of the preceding lesson. Since any
-P-A-G-E-264
    248 Supervised Study in History 
pupil may be called upon to conduct the review, these ques- 
tions should be made as complete as possible. The pupils 
might be given permission, upon the following day, to elect 
one member of the class to take charge of the lesson. The 
pupils particularly enjoy this recognition because each one 
is given a chance. The delegation of responsibility, through 
requiring each pupil to prepare his own list of questions, pro- 
duces a wholesome spirit of rivalry among the pupils. Each 
one is eager to write questions which will win the approval 
of the class and the teacher if he should be elected by his 
classmates to conduct the lessons. 
General Statement Concerning Unit of Instruction XIV. — 
Other units of recitation suggested under unit of instruction 
XIV, such as Banks, Trusts, the Monroe Doctrine, etc., all 
offer the same interest and enjoyment, if approached and 
studied, because they are of present-day importance. Help 
the pupils to interpret past events through the realization of 
present-day problems and conditions. Socialize the work 
in every way possible. This takes much of the forced atten- 
tion and effort out of the study of history, and substitutes a 
real pleasure and enjoyment in the work. Greater effort will 
be made and better results attained than where more formal 
methods are employed. The completion of unit of instruc- 
tion XIV concludes the portion of history to be studied by 
an Eight A Grade.

' AN EXAMINATION LESSON 
Directions. — Each pupil is required to answer all questions 
under Part I. Additional credit will be given to any pupil 
who succeeds in answering Part II and any two questions in 
Part ITI. 
PART I 
1. Make a list of all topics studied during the last month 
which you consider were the most important. (See explana- 
tion following this lesson.) 
2. Prepare one question which seems to you to be particu- 
larly important, in regard to each topic contained in your 
answer to Question No. 1. 
3. Answer any two of your own questions. 
4. Name three topics upon which you have done collateral 
reading, and give the name of at least two books you have read- 
upon each one. 
5. Which topic interested you the most and why? 
PART II 
6. Consult one of the books upon the table; find all the 
information you can upon the following topic: “ The Printing 
Press.” Read this information carefully, list the pages read, 
and then contrast the present system of printing with that 
employed by Franklin. 
4. Using the information gained in reading the references 
found upon “The Printing Press,” apply the old adage, 
“ Necessity is the mother of invention,” to the great develop- 
ment made in the methods of printing.

speech here quoted is upheld by citizens of our country at 
the present time: 
“When my eyes shall be turned to behold for the last time 
the sun in heaven, may I not see him shining on the broken 
and dishonored fragments of a once glorious Union; on states 
dissevered, discordant, belligerent ; on a land rent with civil 
feuds, or drenched, it may be, in fraternal blood! Let their 
last feeble and lingering glance rather behold the gorgeous 
ensign of the Republic, now known and honored throughout 
the earth — not a stripe erased or polluted, nor a single star 
obscured ;. . . but everywhere, spread all over in characters 
of living light . . . that . . . sentiment dear to every true 
American heart, — Liberty and Union, now and forever, one 
and inseparable! ” 
General Statement Concerning this Type of Examination. 
— The above lesson has not been planned with any particular 
grade in mind. It is simply illustrative of the kind of ques- 
tions which might be included in any examination planned by 
the teacher. Fact questions alone have purposively been 
omitted. The purpose of an examination will largely deter- 
mine the type of question which should predominate. If 
teachers desire to test pupils upon their ability to answer facts 
alone, then fact questions only will be found in the examinations 
given. Pupils who are tested by this type of examination are 
being tested only in their power to memorize. The value
-P-A-G-E-267
  An Examination Lesson 251 
of developing this power is recognized, but is it not equally 
important to test the ability of our pupils to reason and think 
independently, to estimate the value of facts studied, and 
to appreciate some of the great events of the past? In plan- 
ning examinations which will test powers other than memory, 
questions might be provided which would require a knowledge 
of facts as a basis upon which further thinking and reasoning 
must depend. 
In a sense every lesson planned according to methods of 
supervised study is an Examination Lesson. The pupils are 
constantly being tested through the various requirements 
in the several types of lessons taught. Both pupils and 
teacher, however, derive much benefit from Examination 
Lessons given at certain intervals. These lessons should be 
planned and conducted in such a manner that pupils will not 
be placed at a great disadvantage through fear of not accom- 
plishing the work successfully. If ratings are based upon 
regular daily class work as well as upon examinations, pupils 
will accomplish more and the results will be more satisfactory. 
Lessons of this type might be given whenever the teacher 
considers it advisable. If pupils are not informed in 
advance and are not required to review every fact studied, 
the dread and uncertainty of success will largely be re- 
moved. The daily review of all topics studied in previous 
lessons and the summaries at the end of each unit of recita- 
tion, through the means of socialized recitations, are constantly 
testing the thoroughness with which the pupils are acquiring 
information. The Examination Lesson may then become a 
period during which the teacher tests the ability of the pupils 
in the power they have gained as a result of daily instruction 
along all lines. A suitable time for such a lesson would be at 
   
-P-A-G-E-268
  252 Supervised Study in History 
the completion of the study of certain units of recitation; or, 
if given at longer intervals, at the close of the work ona unit 
of instruction. The intervals should be frequent enough to 
prevent pupils from dreading such lessons. 
The temptation on the part of any pupil to copy or ask help 
of another will be largely eliminated when pupils discover 
that each question requires the best thought and effort of each 
individual. When it is understood that ideas and opinions 
are required, as well as facts, pupils will begin to have more 
confidence in their own opinions. Originality of thought and 
expression will then be asserted and the teacher will no longer 
judge the individual pupil by false standards. 
An Analysis of the Questions Contained in this Examination. 
— The questions in Part I constitute the minimum require- 
ment of the class. The majority of the pupils in the inferior 
group will accomplish only this part of the examination. They 
should not, however, be prevented from attempting Parts II 
and III, if they are able todoso. Always insist upon the pupils 
giving special attention to the quality of the work done, rather 
than the quantity alone. Parts II and III are provided for 
those pupils who are able to accomplish more than the mini- 
mum requirement in the specified time. Papers should be 
rated upon the amount accomplished. An excellent paper 
which covered only the minimum requirement might be rated 
“A minus”; “A” might designate an excellent paper of the 
average requirement, while “A plus” would indicate an 
excellent paper of the maximum requirement. (Any other 
device a teacher wishes to employ would serve the purpose, 
as, for example, using different colored pencils to indicate the 
portion accomplished.) 
Let us now consider carefully the nature of each question.
-P-A-G-E-269
  
An Examination Lesson 253 
PART I 
Question No. 1 demands a review and summary of all topics 
studied during the period indicated by the question. (Teachers 
should make this period more definite than can be done ina 
question of this general character.) Both memory and judg- 
ment are required to answer this question. 
Question No. 2 also requires the exercise of memory com- 
bined with reason and judgment. 
Question No. 3 demands an accurate knowledge of facts. 
Pupils are, however, given an opportunity to exercise initiative 
in the selection made by each one. If teachers feel that better 
results will be secured in this work, No. 3 might be written 
as follows: Answer questions 3 and 5. Certain numbers 
might be inserted in the blank space, by the teacher, after the 
pupils have prepared the questions and are ready to answer 
No. 3. Individuality is a strong factor in this kind of test 
question, since each pupil is required to do independent work. 
Question No. 4 tests the scope of information gained by 
the individual pupil. Again, the teacher might make this 
more definite by giving a list of topics upon which collateral 
reading had been required. 
Question No. 5 gives the pupil an opportunity to express 
his enjoyment and interest in any question studied. It 
also aids the teacher to understand each individual pupil. 
It is through such opportunities that teachers are enabled 
more accurately to determine the love and appreciation of 
history, which differs greatly with each individual. 
PART II 
Question No. 6 tests the power of the individual pupil to 
locate successfully information upon a definite topic, and to 
 
-P-A-G-E-270
    
254 Supervised Study in History 
organize the ideas obtained in order to contrast accurately 
the two systems above mentioned. In work of this kind, 
material which is new to the pupils should be selected by the 
teacher. This produces a situation similar to that in the class- 
room when thought is required upon new topics. The teacher 
can thus better determine the power the pupils are gaining in 
understanding the thought expressed on the printed page. 
Question No. 7 aids the teacher in testing the ability of the 
individual pupil to apply a definite idea or principle to cer- 
tain facts. The ability to reason is here very essential. 
PART It 
Question No. 8 demands an accurate knowledge of facts. 
These facts, however, are associated with a concrete situation, 
which thus makes them seem more real to the pupils. 
Question No. 9 again requires an accurate knowledge of 
facts. Special provision is also made for self-expression, 
through a vivid portrayal of the scene referred to in the quo- 
tation. 
Question No. ro requires a deep sense of appreciation and 
understanding of the meaning expressed in the quotation. 
It tests the pupil’s ability to interpret the thought expressed 
by another, in the light of present-day situations. 
Each of these three questions necessitates careful thought 
and wise judgment. The fact that pupils are given an 
opportunity to answer any two of the three questions, tests 
their power of discrimination, as well as the knowledge of 
facts. 
The Value of this Type of Examination. — Such an examina- 
tion aims then to test the power of the individual along the 
following lines:
-P-A-G-E-271
  An Examination Lesson 255 
. To exercise initiative or individuality. 
To gain accurate information. 
To organize ideas. 
. To apply ideas. 
To make independent decisions. 
. To recall facts accurately. An EE PA 
We therefore are testing the ability of the individual to 
study independently. The accomplishment of this aim is the 
chief purpose of supervised study.

APPENDIX 
THE PUPILS’ VIEWPOINT CONCERNING SUPERVISED 
STUDY 
TuERE is often no better way to determine the actual success or 
failure of any schoolroom procedure than to base one’s judgment on 
the point of view of the pupils themselves. Even young children 
are capable of making very fair judgments The frank, unbiased 
opinion of a child is certainly worth consideration. 
The statements contained in the following pages are extracts 
from papers written by pupils of Seven B to Eight A Grades inclu- 
sive, who have had the opportunity to study history according to 
methods employed in supervised study in the Washington Junior 
High School, Rochester, N. Y. In all classes the pupils were 
unanimous in their approval. They were entirely unconscious of 
any use to be made of these comments, and were asked simply to 
write their opinions of supervised study, telling why they liked it 
or did not like it. No attempt was made in any way to influence 
these opinions. 
The statements quoted would seem to give conclusive proof 
that these pupils at least found real benefit and actual enjoyment 
in their study of history. The genuine satisfaction to the pupils 
who so readily recognize the advantages derived from this kind of 
study does much toward convincing us that any effort we may make 
along these lines will be worth while. 
“MY OPINIONS OF SUPERVISED STUDY” 
Grave, — SEVEN B 
1. “TI like supervised study because we have a certain time for 
review, assignment, and study. In our review, the teacher asks 
Ss 257 
   
-P-A-G-E-274
    
258 Appendix 
us questions about the work we did the day before. In our assign- 
ment, she explains the different things we are to study. When 
time is called we are ready for our study period. ‘The study period 
is very interesting. In this way I have learned to use a book cor- 
rectly. I think it is really playing a game.” 
2. “The reason why I like supervised study is because the lesson 
starts at a certain time and ends at a certain time; and we always 
know what to do. I also like it because the teacher first explains 
the lesson and makes it more definite. It now is easy to find the 
pages in the book. I think that I learn more in this way. In our 
review the teacher and Pupils ask questions about the lesson we 
studied the day before.” 
_ 3- “‘Tlike this method because we have just so many minutes for 
onethingand wecannot waste time. It saves time,and when assign- 
ment comes everything is explained and there are really no ques- 
tions to ask. It helps us to do our work more smoothly, and we 
know our work from day to day by reviewing. If we find anything 
in our study period that is difficult, we can look it up in our History 
or get some help from our teacher. What T like best is our discus- 
sion in reviewing.” 
4. “T like this plan because it is definite, and because with just 
a little help we can go to work. What we have to study is on the 
board, and we all like to be time-keeper. Also, the teacher doesn’t 
have to tell us what to do, and so there is more time for study. We 
also know just how much time to spend on each subject. It has 
taught me how to use a book.” 
5. “The reason I like this method is because our teacher doesn’t 
have to take so much time to explain what we are to do, and we 
have more time for study. It is interesting to be time-keeper. 
When you have somebody to call time, it teaches you to be quick 
and thoughtful.” 
6. “T like supervised study because it is more practical. We 
have a certain time for each topic. It is also more accurate and 
interesting. The study of the Greeks, Romans, Columbus, Balboa, 
Magellan, and Alexander the Great, was much more interesting in 
the program we now have than any other way we have had. We 
have a certain time for review, assignment, study, and verification.
-P-A-G-E-275
   Appendix 259 
In this way we get done on time and learn more. We have a differ- 
ent time-keeper for each topic. Our program is definite. It has 
also taught us how to use a book.” 
7. “T like this plan because it is easy to understand, and you 
learn more in less time. In supervised study the pupils do more 
work than the teacher, which is very good. Every day some pupil 
has the responsibility of calling ‘Time.’ This makes the pupils 
more alert.” 
8. “The thing I like about this plan is that when we come 
to class in the morning we know what we are going to do in our 
study, and the amount of time we may have for each part of the 
lesson. Everything goes with a system, and this is the main 
part.” 
g. “TI like supervised study because the review is very interest- 
ing. I like to be time-keeper. I like the plan because we have 
a definite time for each subject. We work on aschedule. I have 
also learned how to use a book.” 
Grave, — SEVEN A 
1. “I think most everyone likes the way we study. The way 
we study is known as supervised study. By supervised study, we 
mean the teacher and pupils studying together. The teacher 
has a schedule written on the board. This is marked off with 
each kind of work. It gives the time for each part. There are 
also names of children who keep time, and when the time is up, he 
or she calls ‘Time,’ and in this way, we know just when to stop.” 
2. “Supervised study requires the codperation of the pupils and 
the teacher. In the review we have the lesson that we prepared 
and some things that lead up to the new lesson. After a pupil has 
finished reciting, the pupils who have any corrections or additions 
to make, stand. The-pupil who recited calls them by name, and 
they give the correction or addition. In a socialized recitation, 
you are also permitted to ask questions. 
“The way in which I think it helps the pupils a great deal is, for 
instance, when we have our review, we often have a socialized reci- 
tation. This brings in corrections and the pupil realizes his or 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
260 Appendix 
her mistakes. If we did not have this recitation, the pupil would 
not know if his answers were correct or incorrect. Another example 
is, when we have our study period, we have it in the room. This 
also helps the child a great deal. In case the pupil does not under- 
stand something, or cannot find a certain thing, the teacher can 
help him. If he were to study at home, he would not be able to 
find his lesson or understand it. These examples show you why I 
like supervised study.” 
3. “TI like supervised study because we have a certain period 
for review, assignment, etc. Everything is not mixed. We have 
opportunities to write questions and pass them to someone. The 
questions are numbered, and the person whose number is called 
stands, reads the question, and answers it. If any corrections or 
additions are to be made, the pupils stand. They are called upon 
by name, and they tell what they think is right. I like to study in 
school because if you are in doubt about any topic, you can ask the 
teacher, who either gives you a reference or tells you about it. 
My opinion of supervised study is that it has helped me a great 
deal.” 
4. “As the Seven A Grade comes to the history period, each 
turns his head to the board to see if he has been appointed to be one 
of the time-keepers. This and the socialized recitation have made 
the pupils eager to come to the History room, and enjoy an hour and 
a half. The socialized recitation has proved good in many ways, 
especially in the criticizing part. It gives the pupils a chance to 
answer, criticize, and add further points until the whole topic is 
digested thoroughly. Supervised study is better than having the 
pupils study at home, because the pupil studies hard and knows 
in half an hour more than he would study at home in an hour. 
Also, it is a fair way; everyone has the same time to study, and if 
they studied at home, some could probably have time to study for 
two hours and some for only one hour. I think I have gained 
twice as much under the supervised study and socialized recitation 
as I would have gained if we had not had them.” 
5. “My opinion of supervised study is that I think it is the best 
and easiest way to study. It seems like a game and not like a 
lesson. You are always wondering if you will be able to answer
-P-A-G-E-277
  
Appendix 261 
your question correctly. The charts which tell when each lesson 
should be finished are prepared by the teacher before the class comes 
in. This helps to show when one part of the lesson is finished, and 
a pupil then calls ‘Time.’ The charts which show us what to 
study are very useful, because we know when we read them just 
what to study.” 
6. “Supervised study interests each boy or girl in any subject. 
For instance, if a teacher gives his class history books and says, 
‘Read from page 226 to 239,’ the pupils turn over the pages in the 
book looking for interesting pictures. If they don’t see any, they 
look over the whole book until the time given is up. Next day 
when the teacher calls on a pupil to answer questions concerning 
which they were to have read the preceding day, the pupil doesn’t 
know anything about it. In supervised study, the teacher gives 
certain references, explains to the pupils what they are to read 
about, and next day, in the review period, the pupils answer all 
the questions easily.” 
7. “I like the supervised study system better than the other 
kind of study for these three reasons, First, because we codperate 
with the teacher and in this way carry out our school motto, ‘Do 
im Codperation.’ Another reason is that when we have a socialized 
recitation, a pupil who wishes to find out something which he does 
not understand, can question the pupil who is reciting; or, some- 
times, the pupil who is reciting has not given enough on the topic. 
Pupils may then stand and add something which that pupil has not 
given ; so you see if the pupil listens to the additions or corrections, 
he will be able to give a much better recitation the next time he is 
called upon. The third reason is, in our schedule thirty or more 
minutes are given for study, while in unsupervised study, the pupils 
have to study at home all by themselves, which is very tiresome.” 
8. “My opinions are high of supervised study and the socialized 
recitation. It not only teaches the pupil to answer, but it teaches 
him to ask questions. The work is carried on in a systematic way, 
and is all done under the supervision of the teacher.” 
g. “When we have a socialized recitation and know we are going 
to have it, I think all the students put forth an extra effort in the 
study period. The assignment is also very interesting, because a 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
  
262 Appendix 
problem in to-day’s lesson may lead to another in to-morrow’s 
lesson. I never enjoyed history or geography. They were always 
my hardest subjects. This last term I have enjoyed them very 
much, just because, I think, of the supervised study.” 
to. “I have enjoyed supervised study very much. The reason 
I enjoy it is because you can correct other people’s mistakes. You 
can learn more by listening to the recitation of others, and you 
gain much more than by writing your own thoughts on paper when 
other people have thoughts that you do not have. I enjoy our 
study period much more than I used to because the teacher comes 
around and explains thingsin history, which we do not understand.” 
11. “In our study period we usually have some questions to 
answer which we look up in our history books. If we do not 
understand them, we raise our hands and the teacher comes to 
our seats, and we tell her what the trouble is. She explains it and 
then we can go on studying.” 
12. “The pupils have a period of study with no reciting to con- 
fuse them. When the assignment comes, they all have a chance 
to work at it, thus causing no confusion as when half of the class 
studies and the other half recites.” 
Grave, — E1cut B 
1. ‘When we come into the room in the morning, our teacher 
has something on the board. It is a plan of the lesson for the day. 
The first thing on the program is the review. The review consists 
of the work done the day before. The time for review is from fif- 
teen to twenty minutes. The teacher gives us our assignment. 
The assignment consists of the work for the study period. The 
teacher explains the assignment, and that helps us in the next 
lesson. 
“The teacher gives us facts leading up to the next lesson. The 
next work is the study period, and our teacher gives us not more 
than forty-five minutes of this. During the study period, we 
prepare our lesson for the next day.” 
2. “Supervised study is studying with the help of the teacher. 
There is a program on the board of the things we are to accomplish 
 
-P-A-G-E-279
    
Appendix 263 
in the given time. When we have a socialized lesson, we make up 
questions; a chairman is elected, and all the questions are passed 
over tohim. He reads them, and the ones who can answer, stand. 
The chairman calls upon one, and if the rest disagree, they stand 
again. If they disagree a second time, it is left to the judges to 
settle. The judges are appointed by the teacher. 
“T like supervised study because it teaches us to be independent, 
and to be able to help ourselves in other lessons and things outside 
of school. It is also very interesting to be able each day to find our 
own answers.” 
3. “Supervised study is very helpful to the pupil because it is 
under the supervision of the teacher. She can teach the pupil how 
to study in school, while if doing it alone, it is more difficult and less 
interesting. The daily program with the time-keepers helps to 
keep up interest through the period. 
“We first review the previous work, which often leads to the new 
topic. The teacher then makes the assignment. It helps to solve 
the new problem. All the studying is done in school. 
“There are three kinds of lessons which we enjoy. The first is 
the studying of a new topic. The second is a socialized lesson, in 
which everyone prepares questions on some review topic. Each one 
has a chance to ask his questions and have them answered. This 
is all done in school. The third kind of lesson is a Red Letter Day 
Program. Many days before, the teacher tells the names of the 
men about whom we are toknow. Many pupils look in magazines, 
books, and papers, both at home and at the library, for informa- 
tion about them. We have had Red Letter Days on Lincoln, 
Grant, and Lee, and many others.” 
4. “Supervised study means study which is supervised by the 
teacher. I like supervised study, because it gives the pupil a 
chance to ask a question or to be helped by the teacher. Otherwise, 
the pupil has to study at home and does not get a chance to ask 
questions unless somebody in his home has a practical knowledge of 
the subject.” 
5. ‘Supervised study is study work that the pupil really does 
himself, thus affording him better knowledge of the lesson assigned 
him, but all this is done under the supervision of the teacher. 
 
-P-A-G-E-280
    
264 Appendix 
According to my opinion of this study work, I think it is very good, 
because it is efficient, systematic, and a very excellent way of help- 
ing the pupil to remember what he has learned.” 
6. “What is supervised study? Supervised study is study 
supervised by the teacher. We have a program for the period. 
Each topic on the program has a time limit, so that we take in all 
the topics for that day. We have a time-keeper to see when the 
time is up for that topic. Each day’s lesson is divided into three 
parts: review, assignment, and study. In the review, we review 
all the work that leads up to the new topic. The assignment is in 
charge of the teacher, during which the topics for the next day’s 
review are given. We then study the topic assigned by the 
teacher. When we meet a difficult problem, the teacher gives us 
assistance.” 
7. “A Red Letter Day is all that its name implies. A certain 
great man or men of the past or present are discussed. The class 
collects all data upon the subject, such as newspaper clippings, 
magazine articles, books, etc., and a full report is made of this 
research in class. This plan has, according to my estimate, an 
advantage over other plans. It allows the pupil to do research 
work. It also has the advantage of always having the teacher to 
help the pupil. It also does away with night work.” 
8. “T like supervised study because we have a certain length of 
time set aside for each subject. This is more orderly, and we 
get through with our lessons more quickly. Each pupil knows 
that he has a certain length of time in which to do his work. They 
all work quickly and quietly, each one intent upon doing as much 
as he can in the time allowedhim. This way of studying is almost 
like a game and interests everyone.” 
Grave, — Ercut A 
1. “TI think supervised study is better than unsupervised study. 
First, because the pupils and the teacher study out the new lesson 
in the classroom; otherwise, we would have to take our work 
home. Second, when we stand up after someone has recited, we 
can add something, or ask that person questions. Each pupil is  
-P-A-G-E-281
  Appendix 265 
given a chance to ask questions and add to a recitation. This 
gives all the pupils more knowledge. Otherwise, the teacher 
might not think of some questions and additions, and the pupil 
would not know the thoughts other children have.” 
2. “Reasons why I like supervised study. It is more systematic, 
the mind works in an orderly way, and you accomplish more by 
having a definite time for your work. Socialized recitations are 
beneficial to the class because each person may express his ideas 
and thoughts about the subject, and at the same time he improves 
his English and speaking ability, for if he is bashful but has some- 
thing to say, he will try to do it. Sometimes when questions are 
asked, the teacher tells us where we may find more information 
than has been given in class. As we are anxious to know about 
it, we try to get all the information we can. This gives us a 
wider scope of knowledge. 
“Tt is not putting too much time in one thing and none in the 
other. It requires self-poise and self-control, which are very 
essential to the person who wants to climb the ladder of success, 
and in supervised study you get it.” 
3. “I think it is a very good way to study. It makes the work 
easier and saves home work. It is wise to have a review of the 
previous day’s work in order to understand the new work. Also 
it is good to have a certain time for assignment, when the teacher 
can help the pupil if he is puzzled with some difficult question. 
The socialized recitation keeps everyone alert and quick to see if 
the pupil reciting has made any mistakes. Last but not least is 
the study period, which the pupil uses to study new work, write 
up notes and review some difficult work. Summed up, it gives each 
pupil an equal footing with the other pupils.” 
4. “I think that supervised study is probably the best way of 
helping a pupil in any of his classes. It teaches him to help 
himself in trying to work out problems.” 
5. “I think supervised study is essential to the pupil. Our 
assignments are studied very carefully with our teacher’s help, and 
the next day we are prepared to review. Also, the time schedule 
is a very systematic means of economizing time. It also teaches 
the pupil to study earnestly and carefully. We have socialized
-P-A-G-E-282
  266 Appendix 
recitations which enable us to learn different opinions from our 
classmates. With supervised study there is no home work to be 
done unless done voluntarily.” 
6. “My opinion of supervised study is that this plan is a very 
good one. The thing that seems very convenient in a lesson is the 
lesson schedule. It gives a pupil who has been absent the previous 
day a chance of knowing what lesson was studied then. This 
lesson schedule contains the amount of time which we have for 
review, assignment and study work.” 
7. “I think that supervised study has all the advantages over 
the other way. If you don’t understand, it can be explained and 
everybody gets the benefit from it. There is also the socialized 
recitation. This helps the children to be alert, to know when a 
mistake is made, and to stand and correct or add to the other’s 
recitation. By reviewing, we do not forget the work taken up 
on the previous day, and thus keep up the work from day to day.” 
8. “In my opinion supervised study is very beneficial to the 
pupil. For instance, there is the lesson program, which is put upon 
the blackboard. There are time-keepers for certain topics, such as 
review, assignment and study. In this way it gives us time for 
each topic, whereas, if we didn’t have supervised study, we would 
probably take most of the time for one topic, and so have little 
time for the others. Therefore, only two or three topics would be 
covered, and the other topics would be left for the next day, and 
so on, day after day. At the end of the term, the course would 
not be completed. 
“Socialized recitations enable us to see and correct our errors. 
The study time in school gives us more time at home for play, 
fresh air, and many things that have to be done. We have the 
advantage of having many different kinds of books from which to 
study, where, if we had to study at home, we might have only one 
or two books.” 
g. ‘Supervised study has greatly helped me in my work in his- 
tory for this reason: When a pupil recites in any subject, the one 
to correct him is his own classmate. This gives a pupil a chance 
to learn his mistakes, and also for the pupils themselves to learn the
-P-A-G-E-283
Appendix 267 
    
   
    subject better. Another important factor in my study of history 
is that when I enter the room, all that I have to do is to look on the 
lesson program, and know the work that Imust do. The lesson pro- 
gram consists of the following: first, review; second, assignment ; 
third, study.”

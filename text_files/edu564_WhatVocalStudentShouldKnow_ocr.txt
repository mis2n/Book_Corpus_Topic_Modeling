  FOREWORD 
Too many books treat of the use of the voice as if it were a 
thing too mysterious to be understood by the masses and only to 
be comprehended by a few selected, and specially educated, high 
priests. There is a flavor about them which smacks of the 
medieval magician, or the Indian medicine man. Too often they 
are written in language so technical and in sentences so turgid, 
that one is soon quite lost in a fog of obscurity. Good, old, 
Anglo-Saxon common sense is forgotten, and one wanders un- 
comfortably in a maze of unintelligible buncombe. 
The art of the vocalist is no mystery, except in the sense 
that everything that has to do with the body, mind and soul of a 
man, and his reactions to the infinite stimuli of life and nature, 
is mysterious. In truth, the singing teacher knows quite as much 
about the larynx and its function as the physician does about 
the tonsils or the spleen. He can discuss the action of the breath- 
ing muscles, and the relation between vowels and consonants, in 
clearer, more scientific language, than can the psychologist when 
he speaks of the origin and destiny of the human spirit. In the 
study of singing, instead of mystery there should be logic and 
reason; instead of secrets, the simplified definition. 
The whole purpose af this little book is to enunciate a few 
underlying principles, the common property of all voice users, in 
language of the utmost simplicity, avoiding, as far as possible, 
the use of technical terms. The various words used have their 
usual, dictionary meaning, and no special, hidden one and, where 
there is any doubt, a definition is offered to elucidate them. 
Naturally much has been left out, that might have been added in 
a work of larger size and greater scope. 
It is clearly recognized that the mistakes which even artists 
make are usually fundamental ones, overlooked in the stress of 
artistic endeavor and the strain of our modern life. Therefore 
the exercises offered, few in number and very incomplete, are old, 
tried, simple, conservative and absolutely basic. 
They are designed to help the student to master his breath- 
ing so that it functionates without undue effort, to control his 
vocal muscles so that they shall become almost automatic in their 
action, to form his vowels and consonants into tones and words, 
without stiffness, and to allow his resonances to occur comfort- 
ably and securely: in a word, to become an artist.

  CHAPTER I 
SONG AND SPEECH 
“All art is one” is the cant phrase, which contains in it the 
grain of truth so hard to isolate, and the chaff of error so difficult 
to perceive. 
Yet, practically, this easy and comfortable maxim has little 
or no value. It does not help the poet to write, the singer to 
sing, the composer to compose, or the painter to paint. Each 
one of these artists, to be successful, must understand, con- 
sciously or unconsciously, that unique, basic technique, which is 
the foundation of his particular branch of art. Those of us who 
are interested in the use of the voice, are continually assured 
that “speaking and singing are one.” Or we are asked to accept 
the more modern definition, “Singing is only sustained speech 
upon a definite series of tones.” But the limits of speech and 
song are so boundless that no definition is large enough to contain 
them. Speech and song glide into one another so imperceptibly 
that it is often difficult to discern where one ceases and the other 
begins. Anyone who remembers Richard Mansfield’s wonderful 
delivery of the Invocation to the Moon, in Rostand’s Cyrano de 
Bergerac, will understand immediately what I mean. Was it 
speech or was it singing? Or did it partake of the nature of 
both? David Bispham was in the habit of declaiming to the 
music of Richard Strauss, Arensky, or Henry Holden Huss; and 
in his performances he used every gradation of vocal tone-quality, 
from staccato speech to sustained singing. Wearied by the banal- 
ities and the unrealities of the bel canto school of Donizetti, 
Rossini and Bellini, Richard Wagner took the greatest step for- 
ward that operatic art had ever seen. Opera was not poetry, 
drama or music alone, to him. He demanded, and his great genius 
produced, musico-dramatic works, in which music, drama, cos- 
tume, lighting, scenery and action were synchronized so as to 
make one tremendous artistic whole. In pursuit of these ideals a 
new technique had to be evolved in each of those forms of art. 
It has taken seventy-five years to acquire them, and yet it is pos- 
sible to hear now, in 1924, in Berlin, Munich or New York, better 
performances than Wagner, with all his genius, was able to give 
in his own theatre in Bayreuth.

  10 WHAT THE VOCAL STUDENT SHOULD KNOW 
And yet almost all the questions uncovered by Wagner’s inno- 
vation remain unanswered. Are the squeals of Mime and the 
grunts of Alberich singing? When Siegfried, at the climax of 
the frenetic scene of the welding of the sword, screams out at the 
top of his lungs, does he sing or does he shout? And what of the 
noises made by Fafner, the Wurm, through his speaking trumpet? 
Are these blood-curdling -sounds legitimate upon the operatic 
stage? If my dictum that “Speech and song glide into one 
another” be accepted, these questions need no answer. The boun- 
daries of speech and song become infinitely enlarged; the differ- 
ence infinitely varied. All sound-effects become legitimate, and 
therefore artistic, if they are the sincere, honest and logical results 
of the emotions engendered by the music, the words and the 
dramatic situation. They are only illegitimate when they are 
false to all or any one of these emotions; to use Wagner’s words, 
if they are, “Effects without cause.” 
At the very foundation of all vocal art, therefore, we are 
confronted by the emotion of the individual, and his endeavor to 
express himself through the medium—First: Of articulated 
speech; Second: Of noises, screams, laughter, grunts, tears, etc. ; 
Third: Of tones (singing) and Fourth: Of combinations of all 
of these. 
The problem of the vocalist, be he singer or speaker, is to 
accept every sort of sound which is emotionally true and artis- 
tically appealing ; to study how to reproduce these sounds, faith- 
fully and with the least possible physical effort; and to discover 
whether or not there be any basic principle common to the pro- 
duction of them all. He will soon find that the differences be- 
tween speech and song are not at all differences of voice produc- 
tion. The emission of the voice, the breathing, and the resonance 
are quite alike in both. The differences between them are as 
follows: : 
First: The singer uses as his means of expression, a definite 
series of tones and semi-tones, called a scale. The number of these 
scales may be increased. Modern writers use a scale of whole 
tones, and some ultra-modern ones, influenced by the music of the 
Orient, are attempting to introduce scales of quarter tones. Both 
of these things are perfectly legitimate. They enlarge the boun- 
daries of singing, but they do not affect the fundamental differ- 
ence between speech and song. 
> The speaker, on the contrary, never uses a definite, regulated, 
formal set of tones and semi-tones. The rise and fall of his 
voice is more elastic, more individual, less conventional, less cone
-P-A-G-E-11
  SONG AND SPEECH II 
strained. To attempt to speak upon a definite series of tones 
would produce an effect infinitely comic, emotionally untrue; a 
hybrid art with all the vices and none of the virtues of both. 
~ Second: In singing, the vowel is long, the consonant, short; 
in speaking, both have approximately the same length. The sus- 
tained tones of a singer often last as long as 30 or 40 seconds. 
Speech can never be sustained. The words follow each other too 
quickly, even in the slowest speech, to produce the effect of 
“sostenuto.”’ Only by lengthening the vowel can it be done, and 
the attempt to lengthen the vowel, even the least bit, in speech, 
produces the effect of drawling. Nor can the long roulades upon 
a single vowel sound; the scales, trills, fiorituri, so well beloved by 
the coloratura singer, ever be reproduced by the speaker. 
The singer elongates his vowel sounds into tones, and his 
consonants interrupt them as little as possible. Even in the most 
extreme examples of dramatic singing, which approaches speech 
as nearly as possible, these two attributes, tonality and the 
elongated vowel, are clearly distinguished. The speaker uses all 
the effects of the singer except these two. To them he adds an 
infinite elasticity, and a variety of sounds much greater than the 
singer, hampered by a conventional scale, cat: hope to produce. 
A natural enunciation, which allows the vowel and consonant 
sounds to have their true value, makes his art much more directly 
appealing, and much more easily understood. 
I have instanced remarkable effects gained by. Richard Mans- 
field and by David Bispham, both of whom introduced a singing 
tone in the midst of a dramatic monologue. One of the most 
remarkable effects, I have ever heard upon the operatic stage was 
produced by Ernestine Schumann-Heink, in the second act of 
Wagner’s “Die Meistersinger.” 
In the middle of a lyric dialogue between the heroine, Eva, 
and her maid, Magdalena, Schumann-Heink spoke the name of 
the comic character Beckmesser instead of singing it, as Wagner 
directed. So true was her emotional sincerity, so unerring her 
taste, so clear her enunciation of this unpleasant sounding name, 
chosen, perhaps, by Wagner for its ugliness, that a little chuckle 
of laughter rippled over the audience. 
No pure singing, no matter how magnificent, could have’ pro- 
duced this effect. 
If these two fundamental differences be always kept in mind, 
the training of the singer and the speaker may, and should, be 
along the same fines. Each use the breath, the larynx, the 
resonances, the speaking muscles in the same manner. To each, 
 
-P-A-G-E-12
  12 WHAT THE VOCAL STUDENT SHOULD KNOW 
carrying power, clarity of enunciation, beauty of quality, and 
freedom of emission are almost equally important. ‘ach is the 
complement of the other. Practically, however, the training 
of the two diverges, until, in result, they are far apart. The 
speaker is taught to enunciate distinctly, but breathing, resonance, 
and the easy unconstricted action of the vocal muscles are, too 
often, quite ignored or forgotten. 
While the singer is trained to breathe, to use his resonances, 
and not to stiffen, yet his exercises are usually upon vowel sounds 
alone, or even upon two or three selected vowels, ignoring the 
others. He seldom understands thoroughly the value of a con- 
sonant, nor is the difference in the production of a vowel and a 
consonant made clear to him. As a result his tone is a thing of 
beauty, directly emotional in its appeal, and thrilling in its effect 
upon an audience. Dramatically he is usually quite at sea, and all 
too often his words are unintelligible. This is the reason why 
the actor seldom cares for singing, and why the singer does not 
appreciate the art of the actor. Each has become too narrow, 
too much of a specialist. In reality, they are both vocalists, each 
primarily dependent for his greatest effect upon the use of the 
voice. They must approach each other in all humility and learn 
from each other. 
The old Greek dramatists understood well that neither speech 
nor song was adequate to faithfully reproduce every emotion. com- 
mon to mankind. Their stage productions were neither spoken 
nor sung, but were declaimed, intoned, chanted; a method which 
united a rhythmic presentation of the verse, a distinct enunciation 
of the word, the individual melodic charm of the actor-singer’s 
song-speech, and a certain lengthening of the vowel sounds which 
emphasized the beauty of the voice and increased its carrying 
power. The church, perhaps for somewhat similar reasons, 
adopted this method, so that even today one hears the sacred 
words of the Mass intoned by the priest with a use of the voice 
somewhat more vocal than speech, and somewhat more con- 
sonantal than singing. 
“Behold there is no new thing under the sun.” Art is cyclic: 
It changes as the wheel of Life turns. That which was down 
and hidden, proves, as it turns toward the light, to. be equally 
beautiful with that which we now see, admire and imitate. Beauty 
which was old 3 000 years ago, is rediscovered, and becomes the 
new “Art of the future.” Works from the tomb of Tut-Ankh- 
Amen, from the sands of Baiea, from the walls of unearthed 
Pompeii, give inspiration and delight to the most advanced artist
-P-A-G-E-13
SONG AND SPEECH 13 
of our day and period. So also is it with song and speech. The 
endless recitatives of Bach and Handel, the innovations of Gluck 
and Wagner, the song-speech of Debussy and Ravel, find their 
root not in the Middle Ages but in the age-old, yet ever-new, 
dramas of ancient Greece. Taste changes; the music of the 
human voice, like a changeless river, flows ever on. At one period 
it manifests itself as the pure, bel canto song of Mozart and 
Rossini, almost all vowel, scarcely any consonant. At another 
it approaches speech so closely as to be scarcely distinguished 
from it, except for its conventional tonality. 
It is for us students of the use of the voice, be we singers or 
actors, lawyers or preachers, to examine the past as well as the 
present and to cull from the mass of musical material which his- 
tory presents to us, those underlying principles which appeal most 
to our own time and to our own unique personalities.

CHAPTER II 
BREATHING 
The danger of a fixed method of breathing is that-it so often 
departs from the processes of nature. In every language book 
after book exists, devoted to the minutest description of the action 
of every muscle concerned in the filling and emptying of the 
lungs. Curiously enough these books, scientific as they are, or are 
supposed to be, too often contradict each other flatly, so that the 
poor student after reading a number of them, finds himself more 
confused than before. 
Nature after all, is the truest guide; he who departs from 
her processes is always wrong. It must not be forgotten that a 
man breathes many different ways, according to the work he is 
doing, or to the emotion he is experiencing. In repose a man 
breathes less often and less deeply than when he is running. The 
clerk upon his stool inhales and exhales less air than the piano- 
mover or the shouting huckster, and consequently his external 
abdominal muscles, his diaphragm, and his intercostal muscles 
move with less force and through a smaller distance. 
A trumpeter, whose playing depends upon his ability to pro- 
duce a strong, well sustained, unwavering column of air, must 
breathe quite differently from an oboe player, who must keep 
back the power and volume of his breath, to preserve his pitch 
and prevent his instrument from squeaking. 
Shakespeare assures us that a man in love “Sighs like a 
furnace.” And we know that men and women under the stress 
of a great emotion, amounting almost to hysteria, gasp for breath 
and have no control of it at all. It is the business of the singer, 
and especially of the speaker, to be able to reproduce any and 
all of these effects which are caused primarily by the control 
of the breath. He must be able to project against the vocal 
cords, a long sustained and well controlled column of air (loud 
vocalism) ; or he must be able to reduce the pressure to almost 
nothing (soft vocalism) without allowing any trembling or un- 
certainty to be apparent to his audience. The voice of the singer 
must be of sufficient volume and resonance to be heard above the 
accompaniment, which is an essential part of the artistic whole, 
especially in modern music. Often this is played upon a piano, 
14
-P-A-G-E-15
    
BREATHING 15 
or a small number of instruments, but in the opera, in the 
symphony concert and in the oratorio, there may be as many 
as one hundred men in the orchestra. Performances are given 
in large auditoriums, seating from 1,500 to 8,000 people. : It is 
easy to see that a great deal of physical force is necessary to make 
the tones and the words carry to the ears of so many people, at 
so great a distance, and to prevent the audience from experienc- 
ing a sense of vocal weakness and lack of quality. . 
Robust physical health, strong internal and external chest 
and back muscles, and a strong diaphragm, are presupposed in 
anyone who hopes to succeed as a user of the voice. Without 
them he is doomed to disappointment and to failure. Anything 
that tends to decrease the physical vigor, or to upset the balance 
between body and mind, immediately affects the breathing, and 
is very unwise for either singer or speaker. Careless eating or 
drinking, too much smoking, insufficient sleep, worry, agitation, 
fear, dissipation of any kind, take away the quality and power 
of the voice, undermine the physical strength and impair the con- 
trol of the breath. 
Breathing exercises are intended to increase the capacity of 
the lungs and the breadth of the chest, to improve the resilience 
of all the breathing muscles, and to improve the control of them. 
They must be practiced day in, day out; they must be made a 
part of the daily routine; they must be done through a long 
period of time, to have any real value. 
The usual physical exercises, like boxing, wrestling, swim- 
ming, tennis and rowing, are wonderful helps; but they are 
not specially designed for the vocalist, and therefore, are not 
enough. Nor should one, speaking generally, practice these- in 
competition. No man can sing or speak well in public, after five 
or six hard sets of tennis, or after a gruelling three-mile boat 
race on the river, or a hard five-round boxing bout. Very often 
competitive athletics strain the heart, and no vocalist can succeed 
with an ill-regulated heart. 
Breathing exercises should not be combined with voice ex- 
ercise. They are special gymnastics, designed to be practiced 
~ alone. When they are combined with vocal exercises, they almost 
invariably produce stiffness in the jaw, throat or vocal muscles. 
The breath is the motor which furnishes the power for the voice. 
Make this motor strong, firm, forceful, if you will; but it must also 
be extremely sensitive and resilient, or it will never be capable 
of those delicate, refined effects in which the great artists love to 
indulge, and which bring to the thinking audience the highest 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  
16 WHAT THE VOCAL STUDENT SHOULD KNOW 
pleasure. The full power of the voice should never be exerted 
for any great length of time without change. It exhausts the 
vocalist, and the audience both. 
Shakespeare warned the actor not “To split the ears of the 
groundlings”; and shouting and screaming soon becomes in- 
artistic and vulgar. 
And yet the voice must not be allowed to lose its power and 
its resonance. Even the softest passages must have enough force 
to reach the auditors in the back rows and to carry the artist’s 
message to them. Nevertheless the wise and experienced artist 
learns te use only enough physical force—no more—than is 
absolutely necessary to produce the effect he desires. Until a 
man can do this, although he may be an accomplished vocalist, 
he does not deserve to be called an artist. 
The following system of! inhalation and exhalation is recom- 
mended by the writer as the best, in his opinion, for vocalists of 
all kinds. In inhalation, according to this system, all the muscles 
associated with breathing are comfortably relaxed, permitting the 
lungs to be filled in every part, top and bottom, without effort. 
During exhalation, the intercostal muscles are firmly held, 
keeping the weight of the upper chest, with its bones and muscles, 
from pressing upon the lungs, and therefore permitting a longer 
sustained, and better controlled breath. This is sometimes called 
the fixed high chest method of exhalation, and many of the 
very greatest Italian and French singing teachers insist rigidly 
upon it. Sbriglia was a great advocate of its use, and Jean and 
Edouard de Reszke, and Pol Plancon, his pupils, were supreme 
examples of the mastery of it. No claim is made here, however, 
that it is the only possible method of breathing, or that it should 
be adopted by everyone. If a man’s breathing be natural and 
simple, and if it supply him with all the breath he needs, for 
every effect he desires, it must be correct for him, and he would 
be foolish to change it. 
INHALATION 
To inhale, it is only necessary that pressure should be, as 
far as possible, removed from the lungs and that air should be _ 
permitted to enter through the nose, or the mouth and the nose, 
in a calm, quiet, unobstructed fashion. Inhalation is a natural 
process; do not force it and do not theorize about it. The fol- 
lowing description of what happens in inhalation may help the 
student. Do not forget that these muscular actions occur un- 
consciously ; they must not be consciously willed, or stiffness will
-P-A-G-E-17
  BREATHING 17 
result, and with it a decrease in the amount of breath inhaled. 
Relax; free all the muscles. 
The diaphragm descends, and the abdominal walls in con- 
sequence expand ; the lower ribs also expand, and the upper chest 
gently rises without convulsive effort. At the last moment of the 
inhalation the diaphragm and the abdominal muscles retract very 
slightly so as to be in position for the exhalation which follows 
immediately. 
EXHALATION 
The difficulty in exhalation is to prevent the breath from 
coming out too quickly. Anyone can force out of the lungs a 
great deal of breath in one or two huge gasps. The problem is to 
control the emission of breath, and to supply to the vocal cords 
just the amount the occasion demands, and no more. The solu- 
tion of the problem lies in keeping the weight of the chest from 
pressing on the lungs during exhalation. This is accomplished 
by holding the intercostal muscles quite firmly during the entire 
exhalation, and by gently retracting the diaphragm and abdominal 
muscles to supply the amount of air required. It will enable the 
vocalist to produce a longer phrase on one breath, and will insure 
a control of both loud and soft effects impossible by any other. 
BREATHING EXERCISES 
These exercises are gymnastics pure and simple, and no 
speaking or singing can be tolerated during their performance. 
I 
Part I 
Inhale slowly, deeply, calmly, without any effort, and by 
everywhere relaxing the breathing muscles. A sensation of com- 
fort and freedom should be experienced in the whole chest and 
abdomen. No rigidity. 
Part II 
Through partly closed lips, exhale a small, unfluctuating, 
smooth (not puffy), well controlled (not jerky) column of air, 
by retracting the diaphragm and abdominal muscles, without 
dropping the upper chest. 
Note—The word retract is selected as a convenient one to explain 
the gradual return of the diaphragm from its flattened to its curved 
position during exhalation.
-P-A-G-E-18
  18 WHAT THE VOCAL STUDENT SHOULD KNOW 
That is, perhaps, the most famous and useful of all breath- 
ing exercises. It is strenuous and it must not be practiced too 
often at one period. Four or five times, twice a day, will be 
enough. Be careful to relax thoroughly, during the inhalation, 
and during the exhalation to exert the least possible pressure 
from the diaphragm and abdomen, to keep the column of exhaled 
air constant, and without any jerks or puffs. 
I 
The object of this exercise is to strengthen the diaphragm 
and abdominal muscles, by giving them sudden and stronger, but 
not sustained, work to do. The first exercise is long, slow, diffi- 
cult; the second one, quick, active, free, and not nearly so hard. 
This exercise promotes muscular resilience. Imagine a row of 
candles, each one to be blown out by a single puff of breath. 
All the action in this exercise must be exerted by the diaphragm 
and abdomen; the chest must remain expanded (must not con- 
tract) with each puff of breath. Put one hand upon the abdomen 
and notice how it contracts (pulls in). 
Practice this twice a day, blowing out ten or fifteen imaginary 
candles. New inhalation may be taken at any time. It is only 
necessary to see that the work be done by the diaphragm, and 
not by the upper chest. 
Ill 
Breathe deeply, slowly, calmly, inhaling as in Exercise I; 
then exhale slowly, controlledly as in Exercise I. Repeat both 
the inhalation and the exhalation, all this to be done without 
relaxing the intercostal muscles and dropping the upper chest. 
The difference between Exercise I and Exercise III is that after 
the first inhalation the entire exercise (even the second inhala- 
tion) should be accomplished with the upper chest firmly raised 
by the intercostal muscles. 
This is an extremely trying exercise, only to be practiced 
once a day. It gives tremendous firmness to the back and inter- 
costal muscles, if persisted in over a long period of time. Do not 
practice it too often; it is too fatiguing. 
IV 
Inhale and exhale alternately and quickly, after the manner 
of a panting dog, or a running man. Be careful not to fill the
-P-A-G-E-19
BREATHING 19 
lungs too full of air, not to crowd more air into them than they 
can comfortably ‘hold; and see that no part of the body, dia- 
phragm, abdomen, chest, throat or jaw stiffens. 
Flexibility of all the muscles of the chest, mouth and throat, 
is promoted by this exercise. It is good practice, also, for the 
half breath (demi-respiration), which is used, when there is no 
time for full breath, or no artistic necessity for it. 
Practice this exercise occasionally. 
Vv 
Lying comfortably and quietly upon the back (preferably in 
bed), inhale with the utmost tranquillity and slowness until the 
lungs are full; then exhale in the same slow, quiet manner, with- 
out paying any attention whatever to the action of the breathing 
muscles. 
Reztax ALL OveR 
This is a most comforting and rest-producing exercise, espe- 
cially recommended after a strenuous performance upon the stage. 
It seems to rest the nerves, and, by supplying the blood with 
plenty of oxygen, to restore again the balance between the mind 
and body, which the concentrated effort before an audience is 
apt to upset. 
It is helpful in producing the sleep which many a tired artist 
finds so hard to woo. Many of the greatest voice authorities 
insist upon the use of a fixed system of breathing, whenever the 
vocalist appears in public. The writer wants to make it very 
clear that he dissents from this opinion. He agrees that the 
exacting practice of breathing exercises is of the utmost impor- 
tance, but believes that, during public appearances, upon the stage, 
in the pulpit, or in the courtroom, the action of the breathing 
muscles should be unconscious. Too much concentration of 
thought upon breathing is apt to produce stiffness of the organs 
of voice and speech, and therefore, indistinctness of utterance, 
loss of resonance, and of tone quality. During vocal practice, the 
breathing should be entirely automatic. Two other rules are 
seldom stressed, yet are of the utmost importance. 
I. Never fill the lungs too full. 
II. Never use any more physical force than is absolutely 
necessary to produce the effect desired.
-P-A-G-E-20
CHAPTER III 
VOWELS AND CONSONANTS 
Voice is the vibration of the vocal cords, caused by the pres- 
sure of breath, enlarged and beautified by the resonance of various 
parts of the body. Speech is the production of intelligible sounds, 
expressing ideas in the form of words. Voice without speech 
exists in nature. Birds have lovely voices, yet they speak no 
words. All the cadenzas, roulades, trills, fiorituri, staccati, of 
the coloratura sopranos are designed to show off the beauty, the 
flexibility and the charm of their voices, without words. The 
sound of the voice appeals to our sense of beauty, to our imagina- 
tion; it thrills us by its power, it astonishes us by its technical 
proficiency, but it expresses no definite idea, unless it be associated 
with speech. These two elements are at the foundation of all 
human vocal endeavor, the voice element with its direct appeal 
to our emotion and our imagination, and the speech element 
which, by the production of words, and therefore definite ideas, 
appeals to our intelligence. 
The vowel is the vocal element in both speech and song; by it 
alone are determined the beauty, carrying power, and resonance. 
It must flow freely out of an open throat into the mouth and 
through the lips into the air as far as possible, unimpeded by any 
action of the throat, palate, fauces, jaw, tongue or lip muscles. 
In the production of a consonant, the free exit of the vowel (voice) 
is interfered with, by momentarily touching the tongue to the 
teeth, the roof of the mouth, or to the palate, or by momentarily 
closing the mouth (mand n). The alternation of these two kinds 
of sound produces intelligible speech, language, words, the means 
by which human beings ordinarily communicate, 
Two corollaries become instantly evident from these defini- 
tions and explanations : 
Ist. Singing, which demands beauty, quality, power, reso- 
nance of voice, associated with a set of conventional scales, and 
harmonies, depends largely upon the vowel sounds for its effects. 
2nd. In speech, which must first of all be clearly under- 
stood and intelligible, these two elements have approximately an 
equal value. Yet the feeling of balance between them must 
never be disturbed. No matter how beautiful the voice of a 
singer is, he produces a sense of discomfort or annoyance in his 
20

  VOWELS AND CONSONANTS 2 
audience if his words are not well pronounced and easily under- 
stood. And one does not realize to the full the emotional value of 
beauty in a speaking voice until he hears a Richard Mansfield, a 
David Bispham, or a Julia Marlowe. 
In practicing to obtain ease of emission and clarity of enun- 
ciation, try always for a free, pure, unconstrained vowel sound; 
and in making the consonants, and consonant combinations, inter- 
fere with the stream of vocal sound (the vowel) as little, and for 
as short a time, as is consistent with distinctness of utterance. 
Pronounce the consonants clearly and crisply, but never attempt 
to lengthen and strengthen them. By so doing the vowels are 
squeezed out of shape. Speech becomes too staccato; it loses its 
fluidity, its resemblance to the sustained sound of singing which 
gives it beauty and carrying power, and degenerates too often into 
clearly understandable but ugly noises. In pronouncing the con- 
sonants in both speech and singing, the lighter and freer the 
action of the tongue, the less the vowel sound is interfered with, 
the easier the production of the voice, and the greater its natural 
resonance. Most people overpronounce, when they appear before 
the public. The natural uneasiness which the crowd excites in 
them makes their muscles somewhat stiff and unresilient. They 
try too hard; they push too much breath against the cords; they 
tighten the throat, the tongue, the fauces and the lips—and scream. 
They make plenty of noise; but the words cannot be understood 
and the tone quality is unpleasant. They come off the stage ex- 
hausted. Ease, a sensation of comfort, and a lack of constric- 
tion anywhere, are the most essential attributes of correct speech 
and song. 
“Never make any more physical effort than is absolutely 
necessary to produce the desired effect,” is as good advice here as 
it was in the chapter on breathing. Do not try too hard; let the 
speech occur as the result of a mental conception rather ‘than as 
the result of a physical action. 
_ The ear has as much to do with the production of correct 
Vowels and consonants as the mind, the speech muscles and the 
breath. Only the ear can tell whether the vowels are pure or not, 
whether they are free, clear and beautiful, or throaty, guttural 
and unresonant. Only the ear can tell whether the consonants 
are produced crisply, distinctly, loosely, or harshly, roughly and 
with too much muscular effort. Practice and attention soon 
accustom the ear to the freer and more beautiful sounds. Grad- 
ually it will reject those which are constrained and full of effort, 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
22 WHAT THE VOCAL STUDENT SHOULD KNOW 
and accept only those which are more comfortable and more easily 
- produced. 
Ear training, in the study of the voice, is equally important 
with mind training and muscle training. If a man is satisfied with 
the sound of his own voice and the distinctness of his own 
enunciation, his mind will see no reason for changing. It is only 
as he becomes convinced that some of his habits of speech have 
departed from the normal, that he begins to improve. 
Racial and dialectic peculiarities of speech are many. The 
slurred R of the typical New Yorker, the dropped H of the 
cockney, the peculiar Philadelphia accent, and the flat, monot- 
onous vowels of the Middle Westerner, are well known. These 
habits of speech must give way to freer and more normal sounds 
before success can be achieved. 
Some tone-qualities to be guarded against are: 
1st. Guttural sounds, produced by too much action of the 
root of the tongue and the deeper parts of the throat. 
2nd. Throaty sounds, produced by too much contraction of 
the. upper parts of the throat and the palato-lingual muscles. 
3rd. Squeezed sounds, produced by too much contraction of 
the jaw and the muscles of the mouth and lips. 
4th. Unresonant sounds, produced by contracting the soft 
palate and the uvula, and so partly preventing the natural reso- 
nance of the nasal cavity and the frontal sinuses. 
The influences of race and language upon the quality of the 
voice are enormous. This is caused not only by the differences 
in the shape of the head and face in the different races but also 
by the relative number of the vowels and consonants. Italian 
has the purest vowels and the freest, easiest consonants of any 
modern language; and this is the reason for the beautiful Italian 
speaking and singing voices. Caruso’s perfect voice remains in 
our memory as the most beautiful singing tone of modern times. 
The French nasal vowels encourage resonance in the head and 
nose, and produce a tone quality easily recognized, racially French, 
and very hard to imitate. The lovely floating tones of the late 
Evan Williams, and the living John McCormack, are racially 
Celtic. The German tongue, with its modified vowels and its 
preponderance of consonants, is apt to be guttural and harsh, and 
therefore difficult to sing. 
The English voice is straight-forward, honest, sincere, but 
rather monotonous, and lacking in resonance, and the American 
voice too often tinged with dialect, depending upon the part of 
the country in which the individual was born.
-P-A-G-E-23
VOWELS AND CONSONANTS 23 
Linguistic and dialectic peculiarities will ruin the success of a 
vocalist no matter how magnificent his natural equipment may be. 
It creates a feeling of antagonism or of merriment to hear the 
English language marred by a thick, guttural German accent, or 
by a thin, nasal French one. 
At the risk of repetition, I desire again to say that the cure 
exists in the mind and ear of the student rather than in his 
muscles of speech. His case is hopeless until he is able to dis- 
ba the abnormal sounds, and until he has a will to correct 
them. 
A great many authorities believe in the separate practice of 
every consonant and consonant combination, unassociated with a 
vowel, taking great care that the tongue touches the exact spot 
in the mouth which is, theoretically, the best for the production of 
the desired consonantal sound. The whole attention is directed 
upon the physical act of speech and the resulting distinctness of 
utterance. Such exercises are especially valuable for those who 
have some clearly defined defects of speech. Stammerers, stut- 
terers, and those whose speech is indistinct or hesitant, will find 
them very helpful. But those who are normal will find that they 
tend to stiffen all the speech muscles and to make the action of 
speech more difficult. They do this by destroying the balance 
which exists in every language between the vowel (vocal sound) 
and the consonant (speech sound). In ordinary, usual speech 
the consonant sound is either preceded or followed by a vowel. 
The consonant alone, as a medium of producing intelligible sounds, 
is unthinkable. The student is therefore advised to practice vowel 
sounds alone, and vowel and consonant sounds associated together, 
as they are in speech, as the most practical and natural way to ac- 
quire a clear and crisp enunciation of the consonants, and a free 
and unconstrained production of the vowels. All other methods 
are but unnatural makeshifts.

CHAPTER IV 
RESONANCE 
When one sounding body communicates its vibrations to 
another causing it to vibrate sympathetically, to the same num- 
ber of vibrations per second, the resulting sound is called 
resonance. 
As children, we all have put a shell to our ears and fancied 
we heard in it the roaring of the sea. All of us have heard one 
globe of a chandelier vibrate in unison with a particular tone of 
the piano. No other tone will set it into vibration; but its reso- 
nance is quite marked when the correct tone is struck. The large 
shutter of a church window will often vibrate with a deep pedal 
note of the organ, producing an effect both weird and unpleasant. 
The megaphone of the football or baseball announcer and the 
horn of the Victrola, by their resonance, magnify a comparatively 
small initial tone so that it may be heard at a distance with dis- 
tinctness. 
The strings of the violin alone do not determine its quality. 
The resonance of the wood, the varnish, and the air within its 
body, largely determine the beauty, the power, and the carrying 
reality of its tone. And nowadays, in almost every other house, 
children, with ear-phones tightly clasped to their heads, sit at 
radio sets, laboriously “tuning in,” so that the miracle of reso- 
nance will bring them into communication with their fellows 
hundreds of miles distant. : 
The part that resonance plays in the sound of the human 
voice is incalculable. The amount of tone made by the action of 
the breath upon the vocal cords alone, is comparatively small; and 
the tone quality is singularly deficient in beauty and carrying 
power. Quality, volume, beauty, sweetness are the results of 
resonance of the whole physical body. From the soles of his feet 
to the top of his head a man’s body vibrates with every word he 
speaks and every tone he sings. And the individual tone quality 
which emanates from him is the result of the sum of these reso- 
nances. The clear, white, virginal timbre of the voice of a 
slender young woman is the natural result of the shape, not only 
of her head and chest but also of her young and slender body. 
As she becomes older, heavier, stronger, more experienced, 
or, as we conveniently call it, as she matures, her voice will take 
24
-P-A-G-E-25
  RESONANCE : 25 
on a somewhat heavier, slightly darker, more expressive quality: 
She is no longer a girl; she has become a woman. Life has de- 
veloped her physically, as well as psychologically; and, her body 
having changed, the sound of her voice has changed also. This 
is the reason why a middle-aged woman can so seldom play 
ingenue parts successfully upon the stage. Stage-craft and make- 
up may allow her to preserve the appearance of youth, but seldom 
does her voice sound young enough. It betrays, too soon, her 
advancing years. The free, velvety, resilient tone-quality of the 
voice of a perfectly healthy young man has a beauty and a charm 
all its own. All the resonances and indeed all the actions of 
phonation occur unconsciously, producing a tone color at once 
attractive and alluring. 
It must never be forgotten that this individual, personal, 
unique quality of tone is the most valuable asset which any voice 
user can have. Its effect upon an audience is magical. No amount 
of mechanical artistry, or technical perfection, can rival its direct 
human appeal. Through it man speaks to man, not artist to 
artist alone. It is the result of all the physical and mental attri- 
butes of an individual working together in consonance, without 
undue friction, and without undue effort. 
In a nutshell, these two phrases sum up the entire art of 
voice production. It must all be done without undue effort, and 
without undue friction. No matter how extreme may be the 
emotion engendered by the words or the music, too much effort 
of breath, tongue or throat will make the voice sound labored and 
forced. No matter how carefully a thrilling speech or a bravura 
song may be mentally conceived, too much friction will upset the 
balance of the resonances and destroy the climax. by taking away 
the beauty and the carrying power of the voice. 
Resonance is the result of freedom, a sense of natural com- 
fort in the use of the voice, of a feeling of balance between the 
breath, the nerves and the muscles. It cannot be forced; rather 
must it be coaxed or cajoled. Too much tightening of the inter- 
costal muscles, a slight stiffening of the tongue, jaw, throat, 
palate or fauces, and it temporarily vanishes to return when these 
strictures are removed. Too often students of elocution and of 
singing find that the voice, instead of improving, is losing its 
beauty of tone quality. This occurs when too much attention is 
put upon any one part of the art, at the expense of the others. 
No amount of attention to the breathing will help the resonance; 
no amount of study of resonance will help the breathing. Nor 
can the student succeed unless he understands, thoroughly ‘and
-P-A-G-E-26
ee es re ee 
26 WHAT THE VOCAL STUDENT SHOULD KNOW 
practically, the relation between vowels and consonants. These 
three things must go hand in hand. They must be devoloped 
simultaneously, or else the voice will be deficient and its effect 
inadequate. 
It is the fashion of the moment to develop the resonance of 
the head and nose cavities and to neglect the resonance of the 
rest of the body. This is a mistake. Voices developed along these 
lines are easily produced but they are thin and white in sound, 
because they are slightly squeezed out of shape. Nor must the 
body resonance be developed at the expense of that of the nose, 
mouth and head. Such voices are sonorous enough; but they have 
a limited range and are very difficult to produce. The Germans, 
a race in which force is more developed than taste, are very 
prone to this method of voice production. All the resonances 
must be used, simultaneously and comfortably. Again I must 
repeat my diction—“The whole man sings and speaks, body soul 
and spirit; and he vibrates (resonates) from the soles of his 
feet to the top of his head, with every word he speaks and every 
tone he sings.” 
That posture of body which is associated with good health 
and strength is the best for voice users of all kinds. The feet 
must be firmly planted upon the ground, the shoulders straight, 
the muscles of the hips and back strong, before all the resonances 
can manifest themselves completely. No slouching debutante; 
no thin-chested consumptive, no emaciated sufferer from indiges- 
tion, can hope to produce a firm, strong, beautiful, resonant 
voice. A long course of well-directed physical exercises must 
cure him of his particular ills, before he can hope for success as 
a vocalist. Nor should the man with ‘catarrh of the head, with 
adenoids or enlarged tonsils, or with thickened mucous mem- 
branes, come for help to the voice teacher. It is the function of 
the physician, the surgeon or the osteopath to cure, or at least to 
mitigate, these evils, so that the man may be made more or less 
normal before he takes up the serious study of the voice. 
No two individuals are alike; the sum of their resonances is 
therefore not alike. It depends entirely upon the individual’s 
physical structure. This woman, for example, has a pretty, clear 
voice, deficient in chest and body resonance. She must make 
herself stronger physically, develop the strength of her chest, 
diaphragm and intercostal muscles before she can hope for any 
great improvement. The next man has a fine, big chest, a thick 
muscular body and a thin, nasal voice. The muscles around his 
palate, his jaw and his throat are constricted in speaking. He
-P-A-G-E-27
RESONANCE 27 
must learn how to free them, loosen them up, so that resonance 
may occur in his mouth, his nose and his frontal sinuses. 
Every individual must be treated in an individual manner ; 
hard and fast rules will only hurt, cannot improve. If necessary, 
special exercises must be invented to remedy certain specific 
difficulties. Speaking generally, the American voice is charac- 
terized by a certain lack of freedom in the use of the throat and 
jaw, and especially of the uvula, soft palate and the palato- 
glottal muscles. This tends to shut off the resonance of the upper 
parts of the head and makes the tone sound somewhat flat and 
nasal. Anything that tends to improve, and encourage the reso- 
nance of the whole structure of the head will help the American 
vocalist. To sing Dans la masque as the French say, to endeavor 
to put these bones and cavities into vibration with every tone is 
the usual remedy; and the practice of the hum is the generally 
accepted exercise. The method of procedure is as follows: 
EXERCISE I 
Select a pitch most comfortable for the voice, neither too 
high nor too low, somewhat close to the natural pitch of the 
speaking voice. Very gently, but not weakly, without any tighten- 
ing or stiffening of any of the vocal muscles, especially the soft 
palate, palato-glottal and palato-lingual muscles, and with only 
enough breath pressure to make a tone, produce a sustained hum. 
A sensation of vibration, of resonance, must be felt not only 
in the front of the mouth, close to the teeth, but also in the nose 
and in the bones of the face and sometimes even in the forehead. 
This should be practiced until the feeling of resonance is clearly 
established so that the ear recognizes when it is there and when 
it is absent. If it does not occur easily, be sure there is contrac- 
tion somewhere and endeavor to find out just where the con- 
traction is. The moment it is loosely produced, the hummed tone 
will vibrate well in all the bones and cavities of the head, pro- 
ducing a feeling of comfort and of pleasure. This exercise should 
be practiced upon the five or six easiest tones in the voice only. 
As soon as it goes fairly well, we may proceed to add a vowel 
sound, usually A as in father.
-P-A-G-E-28
28 WHAT THE VOCAL STUDENT SHOULD KNOW 
EXERCISE II 
Hum loosely and freely as in Exercise I. Then open the 
mouth, quietly and calmly, into the position for the vowel A (as 
in father) without losing any of the head and facial resonances, 
and without changing the position of any of the muscles inside 
the mouth. This does not mean that the muscles should be 
stiffly held in one position. It means that they have nothing to do, 
and therefore that they should not try to do anything. Just open 
the mouth, say A still feeling the vibration high up in the head 
and nose, and the column of air being released by the lips will 
manifest itself in a free, resonant tone. 
Practice again upon the five or six easiest tones, until it be- 
comes more or less automatic, until the ear misses the resonance 
when it does not occur. High notes must not be attempted, nor 
very low ones. Instead of the vowel A, one may add, later, the 
vowel O as in toe, or the vowel EE as in fee; but no stiffness 
may be felt in the enunciating muscles, nor must the resonance 
diminish. 
EXERCISE III 
As soon as the method of voice production is established in 
the mind, and in the ear, we may attempt the vowel sound with- 
out the hum. The limit of range in bass and baritone voices 
should be— 
= 
For tenors: 
—= For sopranos : 
| 
For contraltos : 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
RESONANCE 29 
The first vowel attempted should be A as in father. Then 
all the vowels should be added, perhaps, in the following order, 
EE as in fee; O as in toe; A as in law; A as in hay; OO as in too. 
EXERCISE IV 
The next exercise consists of prefixing a consonant to the 
sustained vowel sound. Care must be taken that the consonant is 
clearly and crisply pronounced, easily heard and understood, pro- 
duced with the least possible effort of the enunciation muscles, 
without disturbing the resonance in the mouth, head, nose and 
face. 
This exercise may be written for low voices: 
Baritone and Bass Contralto 
1. ta I. ta 
2. ba 2. ba 
3. ca 3. ca 
4. da 4. da 
5. fa §: fa 
Tenor Soprano 
1, ta I. ta 
2. ba 2. ba 
3. ca 3. ca 
4. da 4. da 
5. fa 5. fa 
Every consonant in turn should be added and each vowel 
sound sung. As all the vowels do not occur equally often in 
English, sing A as in father, O as in toe, EE as in fee more, 
and the other vowels less often. Transpose, of course, to suit the 
voice. Do not slide up or down the scale, sing the note squarely 
on the head, without any strong attack (coup de glotte, glottis 
stroke) and yet without any hesitation. Neither too loud nor too 
soft; never full voiced, never weak or breathy. 
   
-P-A-G-E-30
  jo WHAT THE VOCAL STUDENT SHOULD KNOW 
A variation of this exercise is to add the consonant as a 
suffix, the vowel occurring first to be followed by the consonant. 
EXERCISE V 
This consists in singing simple words, being careful to pro- 
nounce the first and the final consonant crisply and clearly and to 
elongate the vowel sound between them. There must be no pause 
between the first consonant sound and the vowel, nor between 
the vowel and the second consonant sound. 
Bass Tenor Contralto Soprano 
1. law 1. law 1. law 1. law 
2. maw 2. maw 2. maw 2. maw 
3. caw 3. caw 3. caw 3. caw 
And other vowel and consonant sounds such as: 
Feet, beet, late, hate, toe, low. 
By this time the method of producing the tone with the reso- 
nance in the mouth, head and nasal and frontal sinuses will have 
been sufficiently established, upon almost every vowel, to be almost 
automatic. The true value of a consonant, as a crisp, clear, mo- 
mentary interruption of the vowel will also have been recognized 
by the ear, and the mind. We may proceed to a few exercises to 
promote flexibility of the voice. 
These very simple exercises should be sung fairly slowly at 
first. The tempo should be quickened as soon as possible, but 
each note should be distinct without being blurred, and yet with- 
out any sliding or portamento. 
Practice the three following exercises in varying pitches, and 
in three ways: 
1st. With the vowel sound alone. 
2nd. With a prefixed consonant. 
3rd. With a simple, easily pronounced word. 
Only the vowels A as in father, AW in law, O as in toe, and 
EE as in fee should be used, especially at first.

ities, to improve, or, to use the singer’s expression, to place the 
voice. Of course there is an infinity of others, and the teacher 
must use those most adapted to the individuality of each pupil. 
To teach a coloratura soprano as one would teach a deep 
bass, would be criminal. But if one has grasped the principles 
which have been laid down here, first, as regards breathing; sec- 
ond, as regards the relative value of vowels and consonants, and 
third, as regards resonance, he will be able to select from the mass 
of material available in every music house, those exercises most 
suited to himself. From here on the training of the speaking 
and the singing voice diverges. The speaker must go on with his 
elocution, his diction, his study of excerpts from Shakespeare and 
other great writers, and finally his roles in the great plays. The 
singer must proceed to further vocal exercises, to vocalises, to 
songs, and last of all to his oratorios and operas. 
But both singer and speaker must remember that, funda- 
mentally, they produce their voices in the same manner, with the 
same system of breathing, with the same necessities for reso- 
nance, and for clear but easy enunciation.

CHAPTER V 
MENTALITY AND PERSONALITY—BALANCE AND 
CONTROL—SELF-CONFIDENCE AND 
NERVOUSNESS 
It may seem that in the foregoing chapter too much stress 
has been laid upon developing the body, in perfecting purely 
physical control, and that the influence of the mind has been 
almost completely ignored. There is no room here for a dis- 
cussion of man’s dual, or triple nature, or to delve into the secrets 
of the subjective mind. It is enough to say that in the world 
as we know it, body, mind and spirit are inseparable, indivisible. 
Each has its own essential part to play in conscious living, which 
neither of the others can perform. Our entire system of educa- 
tion is founded upon the premise that mind and body should be 
lly and synchronously developed. It is the age-old story of 
“Mens sano in corpore sano” (“The healthy mind, in the healthy 
body”). The man who has developed himself until he has a 
strong mentality, and yet who still retains a poor physique, is 
unbalanced upon the mental side. His mind understands thor- 
oughly how to perform all the actions of speech and song, but 
he is not physically strong enough to control them. On the con- 
trary, the man who by rowing, swimming, tennis or other athletic 
exercises has developed strength and control of his. body, and 
allowed his mind to lie dormant, is unbalanced upon the physical 
side. He is strong enough, anc physically controlled enough to 
perform all the required actions; but he has not enough mental 
understanding of them. Only education, culture and taste can 
develop the mind of a man. By education I do not mean crowd- 
ing the memory with an inchoate mass of unrelated and useless 
facts. To educate a man’s mind is to develop its natural powers, 
to discipline it, to teach it reason and control. 
Culture has been defined as the training and refinement of 
mind, morals and taste. Practically, it means more than that. 
A cultured person is one who knows something of the art, litera- 
ture and music, past and present, of the world. He understands 
how to speak his own tongue, and perhaps one or two others, 
without grammatical errors, and in a tone of voice which does not 
jar upon sensitive ears. 2

-P-A-G-E-37
MENTALITY AND PERSONALITY 37. 
Taste is the nice perception of artistic excellence. By it we 
are enabled to distinguish the difference between a chromo and 
an art work, between a movement from a Beethoven Sonata and 
jazz, between a beautiful line of poetry and a street car adver- 
tisement. : ; € 
Because of a lack of early education, of the opportunities to 
develop culture and taste, many a great talent has been lost to 
the world of art. Talent, alone, is the gift of the high gods; all 
else can be learned. It is only necessary, by faithful, conscien- 
tious study, to bring the mental equipment up to the standard 
of the physical one and to develop the balance between them, 
which is the chief characteristic of the finished artist. Practice 
them both with equal assiduity, with an open mind and a cour- 
ageous heart, looking never to the sad past, but to the brilliant 
future. 
Personality is such an elusive thing as almost to escape 
analysis. Why does an audience break into applause as soon as 
one artist appears, and have to be convinced by another of appar- 
ently equal talent and achievement? Why does this singer “get it 
over” the footlights and that other one with equal beauty of voice 
and body, fail to do so? 
Personality, I venture to define as the sum of all a man’s 
good qualities of body, mind and soul, minus all his bad ones. 
To make the personality more attractive, therefore, strive to add 
to the good or plus qualities and eliminate the bad or minus ones. 
Optimism rather than pessimism, courage rather than cowardice, 
self-confidence rather than fear, cheerfulness even when things 
go wrong, make for personal attributes which attract, while their 
opposites repel. “One leaves a little of one’s self in every place 
and in every hour,” said Sully Prudhomme. Success consists in 
leaving the best; failure, in leaving the worst of one’s self with 
the audience. ; 
This brings us immediately to the consideration of nervous- 
ness. Actors, singers, preachers, and lawyers, all complain of it 
before a public appearance. While the natural, normal excite- 
ment, which comes as the result of a desire to do well, may be 
uncomfortable, unpleasant to endure, yet it seldom, if ever, de- 
stroys balance and self-control. The strong character is ever 
inspired by it to greater effort. Indeed his very best work will 
not be done in the study, but in the courtroom, the church or the 
theatre. The mental exhilaration which the crowd, the colors, 
the lights, and the music combine to produce, help the artistic 
personality to reach heights of emotional expression, and of tech-

nical control, impossible under ordinary circumstances. Hyster- 
ical nervousness in which the knees knock together, the throat; 
dries up so that the tongue “cleaves to the roof of the mouth,” 
~ comes to the young and inexperienced. As they learn control and 
balance it gradually disappears. 
Cultivate also self-confidence. Not the overweening pride 
and conceit, which fail at the moment of stress, but the quiet, 
calm confidence which is the result of reason and experience. 
When St. Paul said, “By faith ye shall move mountains,” he 
enunciated not only an ethical doctrine, but also a scientific fact. 
Only he who has faith in himself can control himself and others. 
Balance! Balance! Balance! 
Body, mind and soul, reason, will and spirit, each attribute 
must be developed into its proper relation with the other; each 
must unconsciously perform its natural function without interfer- 
ing with the others. He who has grasped the tremendous signifi- 
cance of these physical and psychic relations, and who rules his 
life by them, is the one who achieves success. Not to the thought- 
less millions, but to him the past belonged; and to him, again 
reincarnated, we must look for greatness in the future.

  CHAPTER VI 
A “DAILY DOZEN” FOR SINGERS 
Since the great war, life in America has become immensely 
complicated. The cares of business, the rising cost of living, and 
the increasing difficulty in obtaining some of the necessities of 
life, fill our time so full that there is little left for study. As the 
result of our arduous days of work, we find it hard to preserve 
our physical and mental health. Exercise and amusement are the 
remedies generally prescribed to ameliorate this condition, for it is 
recognized that an unused muscle soon atrophies, and that the 
mind sickens if it concentrates too long upon one subject. There- 
fore many business men play golf or tennis, or they stop into 
their favorite athletic club on the way home from the office, for a 
few minutes’ mental change and physical work before dinner. 
Only in this way can they restore the strength of body, and the 
clearness of mind, which the exigencies of our modern life 
demand. 
The great majority of people, however, have neither the 
money nor the leisure to indulge in this somewhat luxurious pur- 
suit of health. For them Walter Camp, of Yale, has devised a 
remarkable system of daily exercises, requiring no apparatus, 
which can be done in the home or in the office, and which takes 
but a few minutes’ time each day. 
Why not a “Daily Dozen” for the singer? The demands 
upon his time and energy are also increasingly exacting. He must 
spend nights and days on trains and in hotels nowadays, which in 
other and happier times he could give to practice. There are also 
_many thousands of enthusiastic amateurs who love to sing, but 
who can give only thirty to forty-five minutes a day to their 
music. Because of the lack of a concise system of concentrated 
exercises, planned to keep them up to the mark with the least pos- 
sible waste of time, they often become discouraged and give up 
their music. 
The reason why no such system has appeared is, perhaps, 
because there is so much difference of opinion among singers and 
teachers concerning the basic, fundamental principles of their art. 
Too often each one claims that he is right and all the others 
39
-P-A-G-E-40
  40 WHAT THE VOCAL STUDENT SHOULD KNOW 
-wrong. This contention is so manifestly absurd that it requires 
no argument to refute it, and it is here ignored. 
The writer has accepted the task of compiling a “Daily 
Dozen for Singers” with a great deal of reluctance. He makes 
no claims either to infallibility or to originality. The exercises 
are so old that they have been public property for centuries. No 
one knows where, when or by whom they were invented. Occa- 
sionally a.célebrated authority’s name accompanies the exercise, 
because he especially recommends it. 
An attempt has been made to include exercises for each of 
the four great divisions of the vocal art: 
1st. Control of the breath. 
2nd. Placement (pose of the voice). 
grd. Flexibility (agilité, kehlfertigkeit). 
4th. Enunciation (diction, the relation between vowels and 
consonants). 
To practice these exercises in the various keys that the indi- 
vidual voice demands will take thirty to forty minutes. It would 
be better to divide the time into two or even three periods, so as 
to prevent any possibility of straining the voice. 
Each voice is different; each personality individual. There- 
fore, exercises may be added to this collection, or eliminated 
from it, to suit the needs of each singer. But if this, or any 
other well planned system is practiced daily, an improvement will 
soon be noticed in technical proficiency, power and control. The 
singer will find himself more often in good voice because he will 
be always in, and never out of practice. 
A piano is not necessary; to practice these exercises a pitch- 
pipe, or a tuning fork, will give a starting tone. The singer who 
is blessed with “absolute pitch” needs no instrument at all. 
COLORATURA AND LYRIC SOPRANO 
Although the range and quality of these voices are slightly 
different, the fundamental exercises to keep them in condition are 
the same. The Coloratura depends more for her effects upon 
brilliance of sound and execution; the Lyric, upon loveliness of 
tone, expression, and beauty of diction. The Coloratura must 
— the more brilliant exercises; the Lyric, those more sus- 
tained.

CONTRALTO AND MEZZO-CONTRALTO 
The main difficulty with these voices is that the change of 
tegister (break) occurs somewhere between E-flat on the first 
line and F-sharp on the first space of the treble staff. The descend- 
ing scale is, therefore, of prime importance for practice, because 
it allows the singer to glide over these changes more comfortably 
than the ascending scale. These voices are likely to have a thick 
and sometimes guttural pronunciation. They must therefore 
practice many vowel and consonant sounds.

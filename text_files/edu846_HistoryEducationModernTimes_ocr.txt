PREFACE 
The present work is a continuation of A History of 
Education before the Middle Ages and A History of Educa- 
tion during the Middle Ages and the Transition to Modern 
Times. In a measure it covers the same period as the 
Great Educators of Three Centuries; but, as indicated in 
the preface to that book, the purpose and method of 
approach of the two works are quite different. The 
biographical material has here been reduced to a mini- 
mum; more attention is given to general educational 
movements than to individual reformers; and an attempt 
has been made to select and interpret thé facts of the 
successive chapters in such a way as to form a connected 
newentiva od +o furnish a suitable historical and social

viii PREFACE 
More striking characteristics of the book will probabl 
be found in the emphasis laid upon educational institu 
tions and practices, rather than upon theoretical develop 
ment; and in the larger place given to American educa 
tion. The account of each educational movement ha: 
included at least an attempt to trace its influence upo 
the content, method, and organization of education i 
this country, while three chapters have been devote 
exclusively to the rise of our educational system. Fo 
this somewhat special point of view, I trust that nol 
apology is needed, as the book is intended primarily 
for use in the United States, and will be of service to our 
teachers largely as it succeeds in focusing the educational 
progress of this country. It will be quite possible, 
however, for those readers in England and other coun- 
tries, who have been so hospitable in their reception of 
my former works, to neglect or curtail these parts of the 
book, and still have a body of material sufficient to 
represent satisfactorily the history of education during 
the past two centuries. 
While this book has been written to complete a series 
of three volumes and render them available for use as a 
continuous text in courses upon the history of education, 
it can be used quite independently of the previous pub- 
lications. By itself it may serve as a reading circle 
adoption, a text-book, or a work of reference. In 
institutions where only a term or a semester can be 
afforded the history of education, or where the teacher 
holds that there is little material of significance to 
American education prior to the eighteenth century, it is 
hoped that it may fill a long-felt want. But whatever 
the particular purpose it may be made to serve, the
-P-A-G-E-9

liberal citation of sources and the selected lists of supple- 
mentary reading should prove of considerable value. 
In preparing this volume for press, 1 have received 
help from several quarters. For rendering more accurate 
my descriptions of educational administration in Europe 
(Chapter [X) and of the modern scientific movement 
(Chapter X), I am greatly indebted to Professor F. E. 
Farrington of Columbia University and to Professor 
G. R. Twiss of the Ohio State University respectively. 
I owe a more extensive debt to Professor J. H. Coursault 
of the University of Missouri, Professor A. J. Jones of the 
University of Maine, and Professor W. H. Kilpatrick of 
Columbia University, who have read through practically 
my entire manuscript, and suggested a wide variety of 
changes. Likewise my wife, Helen Wadsworth Graves, 
has been ever at hand to advise and assist me.

IN MODERN TIMES 
CHAPTER I 
THE MISSION OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
The Eighteenth Century as a Period of Individual- 
ism.—In a work by that most brilliant of ‘literary’ his- 
torians, Thomas Carlyle, occurs the following character- 
ization:— 
“This epoch of the eighteenth century was properly the End. 
The End of a Social System which for above a. thousand years 
had been building itself together, and, after that, had begun, for 
some centuries (as human things all do), to moulder down. . . . 
At length, in the course of it, there comes a time when the moulder- 
ing changes into a rushing; active hands drive in their wedges, 
set to their crowbars. Instead of here and there a stone falling 
out, whole masses tumble down, torches. too are applied, and the 
rotten easily takes fire.” 1~ 
And to one inclined to philosophize about the events 
of history, the eighteenth century is indeed filled with 
interest and significance. In this imaginary demarca- 
tion of time appear to be summed up all the institutions 
and developments of the seventeen preceding centuries 
of Christianity, and here may be found the climax of 
that rebellion against authority and the enslavement of

the individual which had periodically been manifesting 
itself from the close of the Middle Ages. Prior to this 
century men had for the most part found their law in the 
realm of traditions and institutional activity. The two 
chief sources of authority and control were those power- 
ful bodies, the church and the state. To these Europe — 
was accustomed to look for guidance, and, as long as 
the reins were loosely held, there was but little complaint. 
It was generally the deprivation of rights and the cur- 
tailment of privileges that stirred up restless souls to 
wonder whence these institutions procured their author- 
ity and by what right they exercised their arbitrary rule. 
One revival after another—the Renaissance, the Refor- 
mation, realism, Puritanism, Pietism—had burst forth 
with great enthusiasm and promises of emancipation, 
only to fade gradually away or harden into a new © 
formalism and authoritative standard. Yet with each 
effort something was really accomplished for freedom and: 
Progress, and the way was paved for the seemingly 
abrupt break from tradition that appears to mark the 
period roughly included in the eighteenth century.! At 
this point it is evident that despotism and ecclesiasticism 
were at length becoming thoroughly intolerable, and a | 
series of effective revolts was made from the traditional, 
irrational, and formal in church and state. The in- 
dividual tended to assert his right to be an end in himself, 
and at times all institutional barriers were swept aside. ° 
This destruction went to an extreme in the French Revo- 
lution, and for a time individualism ran wild. 
The Development of Socialization—But society could 
not pause here long. The freed individual had to be 
1 See Graves, History of Education during the Transition, Chapter XX.
-P-A-G-E-21
MISSION OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 3 
given some direction, and some way had to be sought 
by which these rights he had secured might function. 
Without guidance or socialization of any sort, pure 
individualism must have resulted in anarchy. The 
more the individualistic movement succeeds, then, the 
more necessary it is to ascertain what the individual 
has to do and how he is to do it. The main tendencies 
of the eighteenth century would logically have resulted 
in disintegration, had not the nineteenth century made 
@ conscious effort to justify the eighteenth, and bring 
out the positions that were only implied in the negations 
of the latter. It is not alone the individual as such that 
has interested the nineteenth century, but more and 
more the individual in relation to the social whole to 
which he belongs, as it is only in this way that his con- 
duct can be evaluated. Thus, while the mission of the 
eighteenth century may be interpreted as tending 
largely toward free movement and getting the individual 
under way, the mission of the nineteenth and twentieth 
has been gradually to regulate this movement,—to know 
the law and help the individual to adjust himself to it. 
If the one period seem an abrupt revolution from the 
preceding centuries and ‘the End of a Social System,’ 
the other may be considered a natural evolution from 
its predecessor and the rude beginning of zons of 
possibilities for the individual and society. Thus the 
main movements of the eighteenth century may be said 
to have but cleared the deck for action in modern times. 
The Two Epochs in the Eighteenth Century.—But 
this revolt of the eighteenth century from absolutism 
in politics, religion, and thought falls naturally into two 
parts. During the first half of the century the move- But the nine 
teenth and 
twentieth 
centuries have 
tended to reg- 
ulate this 
movement 
and produce 
an era of 
socialization. 
In the first 
half of the 
eighteenth 
century the 
revolt was 
against eccle-
-P-A-G-E-22
siastical re- 
pression; in 
the second, 
against 
political. 
The former 
movement is 
typified by 
the rational- 
ism of Vol- 
taire; the 
latter by the 
naturalism of 
Rousseau. 4 A HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
ment was directed against repression in theology and 
intellect, and during the second half against repression 
in politics and the rights of man. The former tendency 
appears in the onslaught upon the church made by the 
rationalism and skepticism of such men as Locke, 
Voltaire, and the encyclopedists,! while the latter be- 
comes evident chiefly in the emotionalism and ‘nat- 
uralism’ of Rousseau. Although these aspects of the 
movement somewhat overlapped each other and had 
certain features in common, they should be clearly 
distinguished. The one prepared the way for the other 
by seeking to destroy existing abuses, especially of the 
Church, by the application of reason, but it soon de- 
generated into skepticism and an intellectual despotism. 
It undertook an absolute break from the old system of 
society and thought, but it gave no ear to the claims 
of the masses. It sought merely to replace the tradi- 
tionalism and despotism of the clergy and monarch with 
the dogmatism and tyranny of an intellectual few and 
with irreligion and rationalistic materialism. In dis- 
tinction to this rule of ‘reason,’ ‘naturalism’ declared 
that the intellect could not always be trusted as the 
proper monitor, but that. conduct could better be guided 
by the emotions as the true expression of nature. It 
opposed the copfrol of intellectual aristocracy and 
demanded rights for the common man. But to grasp 
the significance of this later phase of the eighteenth 
century revolt, with its far-reaching effect upon educa— 
tion and society in general, we must turn to another chap. 
ter and study more in detail the positions of Rousseau, 
its chief exponent and popularizer.

NATURALISM IN EDUCATION 
The Training and Times of Rousseau.—The exposi- 
tion and advocacy of ‘naturalism’ by Rousseau find a 
ready explanation in his antecedents and career. The 
theories of no man are more clearly a product of his 
heredity, experience, and times, and they should be 
viewed in this setting. Jean Jacques Rousseau (1712- 
1778) was born in the simple Protestant city of 
Geneva, but his father, a watchmakér, was descended 
from a Parisian family. The latter inherited much of 
the romanticism, mercurial temperament, and love of 
pleasure of his forbears, and was most irresponsible in 
his attitude toward his son. The mother of Rousseau, 
too, although the daughter of a clergyman, was of a 
morbid and sentimental disposition. She died at the 
birth of Jean Jacques, and the child was brought up by 
an indulgent aunt, who made little attempt to instil in 
him any real moral principles. Naturally Rousseau early 
showed a tendency toward emotionalism and a want of 
self-control. His early years from eight to ten were 
spent in the village of Bossey, just outside Geneva, 
where he had been sent with a cousin of about the same 
age to be educated. Here his love of nature, which had 
already been cultivated by the beauties of Genevan 
environment, was greatly heightened. He found a 
wonderful enjoyment in the rural life, until a severe

largely ac- 
count for his 
want of con- 
trol, love of 
nature, sym- 
pathy for the 
poor, and un- 
systematic 
education.

   punishment for a boyish offense turned all to dr 
After this the boy returned to Geneva and spent 
couple of years in idleness and sentimentality. Then, 
during trade apprenticeships, lasting four years, he wa: 
further corrupted by low companions. Eventually h 
ran away from the city, and spent several years in 
vagrancy, menial service, and dissoluteness. During 
this time the beauties of nature were more than ever 
impressed upon the youth by the wonderful scenery of 
the Savoy country through which he passed. His educa- 
tion meanwhile was somewhat improved by incidental 
instruction from a relative of one of the families he served 
and through Madame de Warens, a person of easy morals 
and considerable beauty. Through occasional wander- 
ings he also learned to sympathize with the condition of | 
the poor and oppressed. At length he gravitated to 
Paris, where he was forced to earn a livelihood for him- ’ 
self and a coarse and stupid servant girl, with whom he © 
lived for the rest of his life. He thus began to develop — 
some sense of responsibility. 
These per- While Rousseau’s days of vagabondage were now over, ’ 
é sonal charac they had left an ineffaceable stamp upon him. His ; 
| in keeping sensitiveness, impulsiveness, love of nature, and sym- , 
general senti- pathy for the poor, together with his inaccurate and 
| ments of the unsystematic education, were ever afterward in evidence. * 
: Further, it should be noted that these characteristics i 
of Rousseau blended well with a body of inchoate senti- : 
ments and vague longings of this period that were | 
striving for expression. These were the days of Louis 
XV and royal absolutism, when the administration of i 
all affairs in the kingdom was controlled nominally by i 
the monarch, but really by the small clique of idle and ; REMY sy:

extravagant courtiers about him. It was necessary for 
those who had any desire for advancement to seek to 
attach themselves to the court and adopt its elaborate 
tules and customs. In consequence, a most artificial 
system of etiquette and conduct had grown up every- 
where in the upper class of society. Under this veneer 
and extreme conventionality the degraded peasants 
were ground down by taxation, deprived of their rights, 
and obliged to minister to the pleasure of a vicious leisure 
class. But against this oppression and decadence there 
had gradually arisen an undefined spirit of protest and 
a tendency to hark back to simpler conditions. There 
had come into the air a feeling that the despotism and 
artificiality of the times were due to the departure of 
civilized man from an original beneficent state of nature, 
and that above all legislation and institutions was a 
natural law in complete harmony with the divine will> 
Hence it happened that Rousseau, emotional, uncon- 
trolled, and half-trained, was destined to bring to con- 
sciousness and give voice to the revolutionary and 
naturalistic ideas and tendencies of the century. He was 
overwhelmed by the number of existing abuses and bad 
institutions, and easily came to hold that all social 
regulation was wrong, and, having turned his back upon 
social traditions, he found his guide in nature. 
Rousseau’s Earlier Works.—It was some time before 
Rousseau crystallized this spirit of the age and resultant 
of his own experience in any writing. But in 1750, by 
a curious accident, he undertook a literary work, which 
at once lifted him into fame. The preceding year the 
Academy of Dijon’ had proposed as a theme for a 
1 A few of the larger cities of France had, in imitation of Paris, founded To these tend- 
encies he gave 
voice in his 
prize essays 
upon The 
Progress of the 
Arts and The 
Origin of In- 
equality, and

tal Contract, 
und Emile. 8 A. HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
prize essay: Has the progress of the sciences and arts con- 
tributed to corrupt or to purify morals? This inquiry 
seems to have suddenly brought to a focus all the chaotic 
thought that had been surging within him, and with 
much fervor and conviction, though rather illogically, he 
declared that the existing oppression and corruption of 
society were due to the advancement of civilization. 
Rousseau’s essay was successful in the competition and 
created a tremendous stir. Three years later he com- 
peted for another prize offered by the same academy on 
the subject: The Origin of Inequality among Men. In 
this discourse Rousseau again holds that the physical 
and intellectual inequalities of nature which existed in 
primitive society were scarcely noticeable, but that, 
with the growth of civilization, most oppressive dis- 
tinctions arose, especially through the institution of 
private property. 
This point of view in a somewhat modified form he 
continued to embody in writings at the village of Mont- 
morency, whither he soon withdrew from the hypocrit- 
ical and cold-blooded atmosphere of Paris. Here in 1759 
he produced his remarkable romance, The New Heloise, 
and three years later he published his influential essay 
on political ethics, known as the Social Contract, and. 
that most revolutionary treatise on education, the Emile. 
The New Heloise departs somewhat from the complete 
return to nature sought in the two prize discourses. It 
commends a restoration of as much of the primitive 
simplicity of living as the crystallized traditions and 
‘academies’ for the discussion of scientific and philosophic questions. 
Of these institutions one of the earliest and most prominent was that of 
Dijon.
-P-A-G-E-27
NATURALISM IN EDUCATION 9 
institutions of society will permit. In the Social Con- 
tract, Rousseau also finds the ideal state, not in that of 
nature, but in a society managed by the people, where 
simplicity and natural wants control, and aristocracy 
and artificiality donot exist. 
Purpose of the Emile.—But the work that has made 
the name of Rousseau famous and most concerns us 
here is his Emile. This treatise and the two prize dis- 
courses their author declared to be “three inseparable 
works, which together form a single whole.” He might 
well have included also the New Heloise and the Social 
Contract, especially as the Emile assumes more nearly 
the modified position of the later works, and undertakes 
to show how education might minimize the drawbacks 
of civilization and bring man as near to nature as possible. 
As the Social Contract and his discourses were written to 
counteract the oppressive social and political conditions, 
the Emile aims to replace the conventional and formal 
education of the day with a training that should be 
natural and spontaneous. We learn that under the 
current ancien régime little boys had their hair powdered, 
wore a sword, “the chapeau under the arm, a frill, and 
a coat with gilded cuffs,” that a girl was dressed in 
equally ridiculous imitation of a fashionable woman, 
and that education was largely one of deportment and 
‘the dancing master, for “this is to be the great thing 
for them when they become men and women, and for The Emile 
aims to re- 
place the for- 
mal education 
of the day 
with a natural 
training. 
this reason it is the thing of chief importance for them as 
children.” On the intellectual side, education was

he should, therefore, be placed under simple, free, and 
healthful conditions which will enable him to make the 
most of these. He must be removed to the country, 
where he will be close to nature, and farthest from the 
contaminating influences of civilization. His growth 
and training must be as spontaneous as possible. He 
must have nothing to do with either medicine or doctors, 
“unless his life is in evident danger; for then they can do 
nothing worse than kill him.” His natural movements 
must not be restrained by caps, bands, or swaddling 
clothes, and he should be nursed by his own mother. 
He should likewise be used to baths of all sorts of tem- 
perature. In fact, the child should not be forced into 
any fixed ways whatsoever, since with Rousseau, habit 
is necessarily something contrary to impulse and so un- 
natural and a thing to be shunned. “The only habit,” 
says he, “which the child should be allowed to form is 
to contract no habit whatsoever.” His playthings should 
not be “gold or silver bells, coral, elaborate crystals, 
toys of all kinds and prices,” but such simple products 
of nature as “branches with their fruits and flowers, or 
a poppy-head in which the seeds are heard to rattle.” 
Language that is simple, plain, and hence natural, should 
be used with him, and he should not be hurried beyond 
nature in learning to talk. He should be restricted to a 
few words that express real thoughts for him. 
The education of Emile during infancy is thus to be 
‘negative’ and purely physical. The aim is simply to 
keep his instincts and impulses, which Rousseau holds 
to be good by nature, free from vice, and to afford him 
the natural activity he craves. Next, in the period of in the second,

is treated in the second book, Emile desires most ta 
- touch, to see, and in other ways to sense things. This, 
therefore, is the time for training his senses. “As all 
that enters the human understanding comes there 
through the senses, the first reason of man is a sensuous 
reason. Our first teachers of philosophy are our feet, 
our hands, and our eyes.... In order to learn to 
think, we must then exercise our limbs, our senses, and 
our organs, which are the instruments of our intel- 
ligence.” To obtain this training, Emile is to wear 
short, loose, and scanty clothing, go bareheaded, and 
have the body inured to cold and heat, and be generally 
subjected to a ‘hardening process’ similar to that rec- 
ommended by Locke.! He is to learn to swim, and 
practice long and high jumps, leaping walls, and scaling 
rocks. But, what is more important, his eyes and ears 
are also to be exercised through natural problems in 
weighing, measuring, and estimating masses, heights, 
and distances. Drawing and constructive geometry 
are to be taught him, to render him more capable of 
observing accurately. His ear is to be rendered sensitive 
to harmony by learning to sing. This body and sense 
training should be the nearést approach to an intellectual 
training at this period. Rousseau condemns the usual 
unnatural practice of requiring pupils to learn so much 
before they have reached the proper years. In keeping 
with his ‘negative’ education, he asks rhetorically: 
“Shall I venture to state at this point the most im- 
portant, the most useful, rule of all education? It is not 
to gain time, but to lose it.” During his childhood 
1 See Graves, History of Education during the Transition, p. 308; Great 
Educators, p. 62. =

NATURALISM IN EDUCATION 13 
Emile is not to study geography, history, or languages, 
upon which pedagogues ordinarily depend to exhibit 
the attainments of their pupils, although these under- 
stand nothing of what they have memorized. ‘At the 
age of twelve, Emile will hardly know what a book is. 
But I shall be told it is very necessary that he know how 
toread. ThisI grant. It is necessary that he know how 
to read when reading is useful to him. Until then, it 
serves only to annoy him.” 
Incidentally, however, in order to make Emile toler- 
able in society, for he cannot entirely escape it, he must 
be given the idea of property and some idea of conduct. 
But this is simply because of practical necessity, and no 
moral education is to be given as such, for, “until he 
teaches the age of reason, he can form no idea of moral 
beings or social relations.” He is to learn through 
‘natural consequences’ until he arrives at the age for 
understanding moral precepts. If he breaks the furni- 
ture or the windows, let him suffer the inconveniences 
that arise from his act. Do not preach to him or punish 
him for lying, but afterward affect not to believe him 
even when he has spoken the truth. If he carelessly 
digs up the sprouting melons of the gardener, in order 
to plant beans for himself, let the gardener in turn up- 
root the beans, and thus cause him to learn the sacred- 
ness of property. As far as this moral training is given, 
then, it is to be indirect and incidental. 
However, between twelve and fifteen, after the 
demands of the boy’s physical activities and of his i 
senses have somewhat abated, there comes “an interval {h, 
when his faculties and powers are greater than his de- 7 
sires,” when he displays an insistent curiosity con- in the third,

cerning natural phenomena and a constant appetite 
for rational knowledge. This period, which is dealt 
with in his third book, Rousseau declares to be intended 
by nature itself as ‘‘the time of labor, instruction, and 
study.” But it is obvious even to our unpractical 
author that not much can be learned within three years, 
and he accordingly decides to limit instruction to 
“merely that which is useful.” And even of useful 
studies the boy should not be expected to learn those 
“truths which require, for being comprehended, an 
understanding already formed, or which dispose an in- 
experienced mind to think falsely on other subjects.” 
After eliminating all useless, incomprehensible, and 
misleading studies, Rousseau finds that natural sciences 
alone remain as mental pabulum for the boy. Later in 
this third book, in order that Emile may informally 
learn the interdependence of men and may himself be- 
come economically independent, Rousseau adds indus- 
trial experience and the acquisition of the trade of 
cabinet-making to his training. But at this point _ 
Rousseau next considers the natural and so most effec- - 
tive method for acquiring these subjects. ‘‘Ask ques- 
tions that are within his comprehension, and leave him 
to resolve them. Let him know nothing because you 
have told it to him, but because he has comprehended 
it himself; he is not to learn science, but to discover it. 
If you ever substitute in his mind authority for reason, 
he will no longer reason.” 
Rousseau holds that this may best be accomplished 
by appealing to the curiosity and interest in investiga- 
tion, which are so prominent in the boy at this time. 
He illustrates with lesson plans this solution of the prob-
-P-A-G-E-33
NATURALISM IN EDUCATION 15 
lem of imparting knowledge. He contrasts the current 
methods of teaching astronomy and geography by means: 
of globes, maps, and other misleading representations, 
with the more natural plan of stimulating inquiry 
through observing the sun when rising and setting dur- 
ing the different seasons, and through problems con- 
cerning the topography of the neighborhood. Emile is 
taught to appreciate the value of these subjects by 
being lost in the forest, and, in his efforts to find a way 
out, discovering a use for them. He learns the elements 
of electricity through meeting with a juggler, who at- 
tracts an artificial duck by means of a concealed magnet. 
He similarly discovers through experience the effect of 
cold and heat upon solids and liquids, and so comes to 
understand the thermometer and other instruments. 
Hence Rousseau feels that all knowledge of real value 
may be acquired most clearly and naturally without 
the use of rivalry or textbooks. ‘‘I hate books,” he says; 
“they merely teach us to talk of what we do not know.” 
But-he finds an exception to this irrational method in 
one book, “where all the natural needs of man are ex- 
hibited in a manner obvious to the mind of a child, and 
where the means of providing for these needs are suc- 
" cessively developed with the same facility.’ This book, 
Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe,! he felt, should be carefully 
studied by Emile. 
The fourth book takes Emile from the age of fifteen 
to twenty. At this period the sex interests appear and

should be properly guided and trained, especially as 
they are the basis of social and moral relationships. 
‘As soon as Emile has need of a companion, he is no 
longer an isolated being.” His first passion calls him 
into relations with his species, and he must now learn 
to live with others. “We have formed his body, his 
senses, and his intelligence; it remains to give him a 
heart.” He is to become moral, affectionate, and 
religious. Here again Rousseau insists that the training 
is not to be accomplished by the formal method of pre- 
cepts, but in a natural way by bringing the youth into 
contact with his fellowmen and appealing to his emotions. 
Emile is to visit infrmaries, hospitals, and prisons, and 
witnéss concrete examples of wretchedness in all stages, 
although not so frequently as to become hardened. That 
this training may not render him cynical or hypercritical, 
it should be corrected. by the study of history, where one 
sees men simply as a spectator without feeling or 
passion. Further, in order to deliver Emile from vanity, 
so common during adolescence, he is to be exposed to 
flatterers, spendthrifts, and sharpers, and allowed to 
suffer the consequences. He may at this time also be 
guided in his conduct by the use of fables, for “by 
_censuring the wrongdoer under an unknown mask, we

Emile at length becomes a man, and a life companion 
must be found for him. A search should be made for a 
suitable lady, but “‘in order to find her, we must know 
her.” Accordingly, the last book of the’ Emile deals 
with the model Sophie and the education of woman. 
It is the weakest part of Rousseau’s work. He entirely 
misinterprets the nature of women, and does not allow
-P-A-G-E-35
NATURALISM IN EDUCATION 17 
them any individuality of their own, but considers them 
as simply-‘supplementary to the nature of men. Accord- 
ingly, he. completely abandons the individualistic 
training to be given the man. He insists:— 
“The whole education of women ought to be relative to men. 
To please them, to be useful to them, to make themselves loved 
and honored by them, to educate them when young, to care for 
them when grown, to counsel them, to console them, to make 
life agreeable and sweet to them—these are the duties of women 
at all times, and what should be taught them from infancy.” 
Like men, women should be given adequate bodily 
training, but rather for the sake of physical charms and of 
producing vigorous offspring than for their own develop- 
ment. Their instinctive love of pleasing through dress 
should be made of service by teaching them sewing, 
embroidery, lacework, and designing. Further, “girls 
ought to be obedient and industrious, and they ought 
early to be brought under restraint. Made to obey a 
being so imperfect as man, often so full of vices, and 
always so full of faults, they ought early to learn to 
suffer even injustice, and endure the wrongs of a husband 
without complaint.” Girls should be taught singing, 
dancing, and other accomplishments that will make 
them attractive without interfering with their submis- 
siveness. They should be instructed dogmatically in 
religion at an early age. “Every daughter should have 
the religion of her mother, and every wife that of her 
husband.” In ethical matters they should be largely 
guided by public opinion. A woman may not learn 
philosophy, art, or science, but she should study men. 
“She must learn to penetrate their feelings through 
their conversation, their actions, their looks, and their

gestures, and know how to give them the feelings which

them.” oo 
Merits and Defects of the Emile—Such was Rous- 
seau’s notion of a natural individualistic education for 
a man and the passive and repressive training suitable 
for a woman, and of the happiness and prosperity that 
were bound to ensue. To make a fair estimate of the 
Emile and its influence is not easy. It is necessary to 
put aside all of one’s prejudices against the weak and 
offensive personality of the author and to view the con- 
tradictions of his life and work in the proper perspective. 
It must also be admitted at the start that the Emile is 
often illogical, erratic, and inconsistent. Rousseau 
constantly sways from optimism to pessimism, from 
spontaneity to authority, from liberalism to intolerance. 
While he holds that society is thoroughly corrupt, he has 
great confidence in the goodness of all individuals of 
which it is composed. In the face of history and psychol- 
ogy, he opposes nature to culture, and creates a dualism 
between emotion and reason. Although the instincts 
and reactions of Emile are apparently given free play, 
they are really under the constant guidance of his 
tutor. Emile is to have his individuality developed to 
its utmost, but Sophie’s is to be trained out of her. 
However, in spite of such glaring inconsistencies, the 
Emile has at all times been accounted a work of great 
richnéss and power. The brilliant thought, the under- 
lying wisdom of many of its suggestions, the sentimental] 
appeal, and the clear, enthusiastic, and ardent presenta— 
tion have completely overbalanced .its contradictions 
and logical deficiencies. Its errors and illusions are fully
-P-A-G-E-37

outweighed by. great truths, lofty sentiments, and 
definite contributions to educational theory and practice. 
The Break with Social Traditions.-¢The most marked 
feature of the Rousselian education and the one most 
subject to criticism has been its extreme revolt against 
civilization and all social control.} A state of nature is 
held to be the ideal condition, and all sdcial relations 
are regarded as degenerate. The child is to be brought 
up in isolation by the laws of brute necessity and to 
have no social or political education until he is fifteen, 
when an impossible set of expedients for bringing him 
into touch with his fellows is devised. The absurdity of 
this anti-social education has always been keenly felt. 
Children cannot be reared in a social vacuum, nor can 
they be trained merely as world citizens to the complete 
exclusion of specific governmental authority. And 
although society may become stereotyped and corrupt, 
it furnishes the means of carrying the accumulated race 
experience and attainments. One should remember, 
however, that the times and the cause had need of just 
so extreme a doctrine. The reformer is often forced to 
assume the position of a fanatic, in order to secure atten- 
tion for his propaganda. Had Rousseau’s cry been 
uttered a generation later, when society had become less 
- artificial and more responsive to popular rights, it might 
have contained less exaggeration. But at the time such 
individualism alone could enable him to break the 
bondage to the past. By means of paradoxes and 
exaggerations he was able to emphasize the crying need 
of a natural development of man, and to tear down the 
effete traditions in educational organization, content, 
and methods. The anti-

i 
The Social Movements in Modern Education.— 
Hence, although Rousseau’s mission was largély to 
destroy traditionalism, and most of the specific features 
of his naturalism have in time been modified or rejected, 
many important advances in modern education would 
seem to go back to him. His criticism caused men to 
tush to the defence of existing systems, and when they 
failed in their attempts to reinstate them, they undertook 
the construction of something better. In the first place, 
his attitude toward the artificial, superficial, and in- 
human society of the times led him to oppose its arbitrary 
authority and guidance of education according to an 
unnatural and traditional organization. (He advocated 
the virtues of the primitive man and a simpler basis of 
social organization, and held that all members of society 
should be trained industrially so as to contribute to 
their own support and to be sympathetic and benevolent 
toward their fellows. VThrough him. education has been 
__more closely related to human welfare. The industrial 
work of Pestalozzi and Fellenberg, the moral aim of 
education held by Herbart, the social participation in 
the practice of Froebel, and the present-day emphasis 
upon vocational education, moral instruction, and train- 
ing of defectives and of other extreme variations, alike 
find some of their roots in the Emile. In fact, the 
fallacy involved in Rousseau’s isolated education is too 
palpable to mislead any one, and those who have best 
caught his spirit and endeavored to develop his practice 
have all most insistently stressed social activities in the 
training of children and striven to make education lead 
to a closer and more sympathetic codperation in society. 
Hence in Rousseau’s negative and apparently anti-
-P-A-G-E-39
NATURALISM IN EDUCATION 2r 
social training are clearly implied many of the social 
movements in modern education. 
. The Scientific Movement in Modern Education.— By his rejec 
oreover, since Rousseau repudiated all social traditions tnd ook 
and accepted nature as his only guide, he was absolutely Hence Ota 
opposed to all book learning and exaggerated the value of nature 
of personal observation and influence He consequently “8 a4, 
neglected the past, and wished to rob the pupil of all the work, heel 
experience of his fellows and of those whe had gone develop the 
before. {But he stressed the use of natural objects in the w¢pt ‘clences | [i 
curriculum and developed the details of nature study uum. 
and observational work to an extent never previously 
undertaken. Partly as a result of this influence, schools 
and colleges have come to include in their course the 
study of physical forces, natural environment, plants, 
and animals. ) Therein Rousseau not only anticipates 
somewhat the nature study and geography of Pestalozzi, 
Basedow, Salzmann, and Ritter, but, in a way, fore- 
shadows the arguments of Spencer, Huxley, and the 
modern scientific movement in education.

ferent periods. 22 A HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
have of it, the farther we go the farther we wander from the right 
path. The wisest among us are engrossed in what the adult needs 
te know and fail to consider what children are able to apprehend. 
We are always looking for the man in the child, without thinking 
of what he is before he becomes a man. This is the study to which 
‘I have devoted myself, to the end that, even though my whole 
method may be chimerical and false, the reader may still profit 
by my observations. I may have a very poor conception of what 
ought to be done, but I think I have the correct view of the sub- 
ject on which we are to work. Begin, then, by studying your 
pupils more thoroughly, for assuredly you know nothing about 
them. Now if you read this book of mine with this purpose in 
view, I do not believe it will be without profit to you.” 
As a result of such appeals, the child has become the 
center of discussion in modern training, and we may 
thank Rousseau for introducing a new principle into 
education. And, despite his limitations and prejudices, 
this unnatural and neglectful parent stated many de- 
tails of child development with much force and clearness 
and gave an impetus to later reformers, who were able 
to correct his observations and make them more prac- 
ticable in education. In this connection should especially 
be considered Rousseau’s theory of ‘delayed maturing,’ 
which is later restated by Froebel. He makes a sharp 
division of the pupil’s development into definite stages 
that seem but little connected with one another, and 
prescribes a distinct education for each period. This is 
often cited as a ruinous breach in the evolution of the 
individual, and the reductio ad absurdum of such an 
atomic training would seem to be reached in his hope of 
rendering Emile warm-hearted and pious, after keeping 
him in the meshes of self-interest and doubt until he 
‘is fifteen. But such a criticism loses sight of the remark-
-P-A-G-E-41
NATURALISM IN EDUCATION 23 
able contribution to educational theory and practice 
made thereby. Rousseau has shown that there are 
characteristic differences at different stages in the child’s 
life, but each “has a perfection or maturity of its own,” 
and that only as the proper activities are provided for . 
each stage will it reach that maturity or perfection. It 
can be seen how these principles fulfill his contention 
that the child must be studied, and mark Rousseau as a 
progenitor of the child study movement} 
In keeping with this, Rousseau also held that education 
should be conducted according to the way in which the 
mind of the child works under the stimulation of the 
interests that are characteristic of the various periods; 
- This is the fundamental consideration with him in deter? 
mining the course of study and methods of teaching. 
He may, therefore, be credited to a great degree with the 
increasing tendency to cease from forcing upon children 
a fixed method of thinking, feeling, and acting, and for 
the gradual disappearance of the old ideas that a task 
is of educational value according as it is distasteful, and 
that real education consists in overcoming meaningless 
difficulties. [Curiosity and interest are rather to be used 
as motives for study, and Rousseau therein points the 
way for the Herbartians. {It is likewise due to him 
primarily that we have recognized the need of physical 
activities and sense training in the earlier development 
of the child as a foundation for its later growth and 
learning. }To these recommendations may be traced 
much of the object teaching of Pestalozzianism and 
_ the motor expression of Froebelianism. Thus Rousseau 
made a large contribution to educational method by 
showing the value of motivation, of creating problems, And through

and may be regarded as the father of the psycholog- 
ical movements in modern education. He could not, 
however, have based his study of children and his ad- 
vanced methods upon any real scientific knowledge, for 
in his day the ‘faculty’ psychology absolutely prevailed. 
_ Instead of working out his methods from scientific 
principles, he obtained them, as did Pestalozzi after- 
wards, through his sympathetic understanding of the 
child and his ability to place himself in the child’s 
situation and see the world through the eyes of the child. 
It is not until the time of Herbart that a scientific 
formulation of method and a scientific system of psychol~ 
ogy first appear. 
The Spread of Rousseau’s Doctrines.—Thus the influ- 
ence of Rousseau upon education in all its aspects has 
been most weighty and far-reaching. It is shown by 
the library of books since written to contradict, correct, 
or disseminate his doctrines. During the quarter of a 
century following the publication of the Emile, prob- 
ably more than twice as many ‘books upon education 
were published as in the preceding three-quarters of a 
century. This epoch-making work created and forced. 
a rich harvest of educational thinking for a century 
after its appearance, and it has affected our ideas upon 
education from that day to this. As indicated, then, 
most modern movements in educational organization, 
method, and content, find their roots in Rousseau, and 
he is seen to be the intellectual progenitor of Pestalozzi, 
Herbart, Froebel, Spencer, and many other modern re- 
formers. But his principles did not take immediate 
hold on the schools themselves, although their influence
-P-A-G-E-43
NATURALISM IN EDUCATION 25 
is manifest there as the nineteenth century advanced. 
In France they were apparent in the complaints and 
recommendations concerning schools in many of the 
cahiers that were issued just prior to the revolution, 
and afterward clearly formed a basis for much of the 
legislation concerning the universal, free, and secular 
organization of educational institutions. In England, 
since there was no national system of schools, little | 
direct impression was made upon educational practice. 
But in America this revolutionary thought would seem 
to have had much to do with causing the unrest that 
gradually resulted in upsetting the aristocratic and 
formal training of the young and in secularizing and 
universalizing the public school system. The first 
definite attempt, however, to put into actual practice 
the naturalistic education of Rousseau occurred in 
Germany through the writings of Basedow and the 
foundation of the ‘Philanthropinum,’ and is of sufficient 
importance to demand separate discussion. 
Development of Basedow’s Educational Reforms.— 
Johann Bernhard Basedow (1723-1790) was by nature 
the very sort of person to be captivated by Rousseau’s 
doctrines. He was talented, but erratic, unorthodox, 
tactless, and irregular in life. He had been prepared at 
the University of Leipzig for the Lutheran ministry, but , 
proved too heretical, and giving up this vocation, became 
a tutor in Holstein to a Herr von Quaalen’s children. 
With these aristocratic pupils he first developed methods 
of teaching through conversation and play connected 
1 These were lists of grievances and desired reforms prepared by the 
various towns and villages throughout France at the request of the 
king (Louis XVI), in accordance with an old custom. ‘The erratic 
Basedow was, 
through the 
Emile, in-

form the

with surrounding objects. A few years after this, in 1763 
Basedow fell under the spell of Rousseau’s Emile, whic 
was most congenial to his methods of thinking an 
teaching, and turned all his energy toward education: 
reform. As in the case of Rousseau with educati 
France, he realized that the German education o 
day was sadly in need of just such an antidote as -nar- 
uralism’ was calculated to furnish. The school-rooms| 
were-dismal and the work was unpleasant, physical train- 
ing was neglected, and the discipline was severe. Chil- 
dren were regarded as adults in miniature, and were so 
treated both in their dress and their education. The 
current schooling consisted largely of instruction in 
artificial deportment. The study of classics composed 
the entire intellectual curriculum, and the methods were 
purely grammatical. As a result, suggestions made by 
Basedow for educational improvement attained as 
great popularity as his advanced theological propositions 
had received abuse. 
Through his In 1768 by his Address on Schools and Studies, and 
Schools he their Influence on the Public Weal, he called generally

sean. To assist this reform, he planned to bring out a work on 
elementary education, which he described in outline. 
Great interest in his proposals was shown throughout:

Europe by sovereigns, nobles, prominent men, and rich 
and poor alike that were interested in a nonsectarian 
and more effective education. A subsidy to the sum of 
ten thousand dollars was speedily raised. Six years 
later, Basedow completed his promised text-book, Ele- 
mentarwerk, and the companion work for teachers and 
parents known as Methodenbuch. The Elementarwerk 
was accompanied by a volume containing one hundred 
plates, which illustrated the subject matter of the text, 
but were too large to be bound in withit. In his manuals 
Basedow does not seem to see the problem exactly as 
Rousseau did, but accepts some of the old traditions. 
For instance he retains Latin in his suggested training. 
Nevertheless, he did get many naturalistic ideas from 
Rousseau, and through them saw that further study was 
necessary to answer more fully the problems with which 
these things were connected. 
The Elementarwerk clearly combines ideas taken from 
many sources, including many of the principles of Come- 
nius as well as of Rousseau. It has, in fact, been often 
referred to as ‘the Orbis Pictus* of the eighteenth cen- 
tury,’ and gives a knowledge of things and words in the 
form of a dialogue. The Methodenbuch, while not fol- 
lowing Rousseau completely, contains many ideas 
concerning natural training that are suggestive of him. 
In this study of the nature of children, the book makes 
some advance upon the Rousselian doctrine by finding 
that they are especially interested in motion and noise, 
although Basedow would have shocked Rousseau by 
‘being so much under the control of tradition as to sug-

   He and his gest using these interests in the teaching of Latin. Later,

pocks 3 2 im * books especially.adapted to the character, interests, and] 
Robinson needs of children. These works are all largely filled 
wmonded by with didactics, moralizing, religiosity, and scraps of 
"- scientific information. The best known of them is 
Robinson der Jiingere (Robinson Crusoe Junior), which 
was published by Campe in 1779. It seems to have been 
suggested by Rousseau’s recommendation of Robinsoz 
Crusoe as a text-book, and in turn a generation later it 
became the model for Der Schweizerische Robinson (The 
Swiss Family Robinson) of Wyss, which has been so 
popular with children in America and elsewhere. 
Through Course and Methods of the Philanthropinum.— 
ati ne Eight years before this, however, Prince Leopold of 
dow founded Dessau had been induced to allow Basedow to found 
thropinum’ at there a model school called the ‘Philanthropinum,’ 
Desa, fe which should embody that reformer’s ideas. Leopold 
patumalisti granted him a salary of eleven hundred thalers,1 and 
meas: three years later gave him an equipment of buildings, 
grounds, and endowment. At first Basedow had but 
three assistants, but later the number was considerably 
increased. The staff then included several very able 
men,—such as Wolke, who had taught at Leipzig; 
Campe, formerly chaplain at Potsdam; Salzmann, who 
had been a professor at Erfurt; and Matthison, the poet. 
The underlying principle of the Philanthropinum was 
“everything according to nature.” The natural in- 
stincts and interests of the children were only to be

cents.

directed and not altogether suppressed. They were to be 
trained as children and not as adults, and the methods of 
learning were to be adapted to their stage of mentality. 
That all of the customary unnaturalness, discomfort, 
and want of freedom might be eliminated, the boys were 
plainly dressed in sailor jackets and loose trousers, their 
collars were turned down and were open at the neck, 
and their hair was cut short and was free from powder, 
pomade, and hair-bags. 
While universal education was believed in, and rich 
and poor alike were to be trained, the traditional idea 
still obtained that the natural education of the one class 
was for social activity and leadership, and of the other 
for teaching. Consequently, the wealthy boys were to 
spend six hours in school and two in manual labor, while 
those from families of small means labored six hours and 
studied two. Every one, however, was taught handi- 
crafts,—carpentry, turning, planing, and threshing, as 
suggested in the third book of the Emile, and there were 
also physical exercises and games for all. On the in- 
tellectual side, while Latin was not neglected, consider- 
able attention was paid to the vernacular and French. 
According to the Elementarwerk, Basedow planned 
especially to create a wide objective and practical course 
very similar to that suggested by Comenius. It was to 
give some account of man, including bits of anthropology, 
anatomy, and physiology; of brute creation, especially 
the uses of domestic animals and their relation to in- 
dustry; of trees and plants with their growth, culture, 
and products; of minerals and chemicals; of mathemat- 
ical and physical instruments; and of trades, history, and 
commerce. He afterward admitted that he had over- Universal

Pesining with Similar linguistic methods had been recommended by 
Montaigne, Ratich, and Locke, and largely worked out © 
by Comenius, but were never before made as practical 
as by Basedow and his assistants. His instruction in 
arithmetic, geometry, geography, physics, nature study, 
and history was fully as progressive as that in languages, 
and, while continuing Rousseau’s suggestions, seems to 
anticipate much of the ‘object teaching’ of Pestalozzi. 
Arithmetic was taught by mental methods, geometry 
by drawing figures accurately and neatly, and geography 
by beginning with one’s home, and extending out into 
the neighborhood, the town, the country, and the con- 
tinent. In a similarly direct way the pupils were in- 
structed in matters of actual life. For example, they cast 
lots in the classroom to see who should have the privilege 
of describing the tools and processes of a trade depicted 
in an engraving.

to more than fifty. Most visitors were greatly pleased 
with the school, especially on account of the interested 
and alert appearance of the pupils. Kant had such high 
expectations of its results as to declare in 1777 that it 
meant “not a slow reform, but a quick revolution,” and 
felt that “by the plan of organization it must of itself 
throw off all the faults which belong to its beginning.” 
He afterward admitted that he had been too optimistic, 
but he still felt that the experiment had been well worth 
while, and had paved the way for better things. Al- 
though it may not have served well for older pupils, it 
was certainly excellent in its stimulus to children under 
ten or twelve, who too often are naturally averse to 
books, and can be captured only by such. appeals to 
the physical activities, the senses, and other primary 
interests. 
Basedow, however, proved temperamentally unfit to 
direct the institution. He soon left, and began to teach 
privately in Dessau and write educational works along 
the lines he had started. Joachim Heinrich Campe 
(1746-1818), who first superseded him, withdrew within 
a year to found a similar school at Hamburg. Institu- 
tions of the same type sprang up elsewhere, and some 
of them had a large influence upon education. The most 
striking and enduring of these schools was that estab- 
lished in 1784 by Christian Gotthilf Salemann (1744-1811) 
at Schnepfenthal under the patronage of the royal 
family of Saxe-Gotha. The natural surroundings— 
mountains, valleys, lakes—were most favorable for the 
purpose of the institution, and much attention was given 
to nature study, ‘lessons on things,’ organized excursions, 
gardening, agricultural work, and care of domestic The Philan-

animals. Manual training, gymnastics, sports, informal 
moral and religious culture, and other features that 
anticipated later developments in education also formed 
part of the course. During the decade before the estab- 
lishment of Salzmann’s school, institutions embodying 
many of Basedow’s ideas were opened at Rechahn and 
his other Brandenburg estates by Baron Eberhard von 
Rochow (1734-1805). His schools were simply intended 
to improve the peasantry in their methods of farming 
and living, but, when this step toward universal educa- 
tion proved extraordinarily successful, Rochow ad- 
vocated the adoption of a complete national system of 
schools on a nonsectarian basis. 
ant me In 1793 the Philanthropinum at Dessau was closed 
thropinic permanently. Its teachers were scattered through 
ema 4, Europe, and gave a great impulse to the new education. 
and came An unfortunate result of this popularity was that the 
intothehands pyilanthropinum became a fad, and schools with this 
panks name were opened everywhere in Germany by educa- 
many new tional mountebanks. These teachers prostituted the

ods ind in- a mere trade, and became the subject of much satire 
training. and ridicule. Nevertheless, the philanthropinic move- 
ment seems not to have been without good results, 
especially when we consider the educational conditions 
and the pedagogy of the times. It introduced many 
new ideas concerning methods and industrial training 
into all parts of France and Switzerland, as well as 
Germany, and these were carefully worked out by such 
reformers as Pestalozzi, Froebel, and Herbart. In this 
way there were embodied in education the first positive 
results of the destructive ‘naturalism’ of Rousseau, and

there appeared further progress in the social, scientific, 
and psychological movements of modern education. 
The significance of the naturalistic movement will be 
patent when we come to the work of the later reformers, 
but we must now turn for a time to a different phase 
of educational development.

PHILANTHROPY IN EDUCATION 
English Social and Educational Conditions in the In the cight- 
Eighteenth Century.—The eighteenth century cannot Ce en 
be regarded altogether as a period of revolution and wore Ten 
destruction. While such a characterization describes well as de 
some of the prevailing tendencies, there were also social structive 
and educational forces that looked to evolution and society and 
reform rather than to a complete disintegration of cation. 
society and a return to animal or to primitive living. 
There was still some attempt to build upon the past, 
and, while modifying traditions and conditions, to 
alleviate and improve, and not entirely ignore-or reject 
society as it existed. Moreover, even in Rousseau, the 
arch-destroyer of traditions, we found many evidences 
of a reconstruction along higher lines, and beginnings of 
the development of social, psychological, and scientific 
movements in modern education. And such a positive 
movement was decidedly obvious in Basedow, Salzmann, 
and other philanthropinists. But reforms were even 
more apparent in England. In the land of the Briton, 
progress is proverbially gradual, and sweeping victories 
and Waterloo defeats in affairs of society and education 
are alike unwonted. The French tendency to cut short . 
the social and educational process and to substitute 
revolution for evolution is out of accord with the spirit 
across the English Channel. Hence in England educa- -

tional movements took place in the eighteenth century 
largely as a continuation of those characterizing the 
seventeenth, and were the outgrowth of philanthropy 
on the part of the upper classes rather than the result 
_ of a general uprising of the unfortunate masses. 
Philanthropy 
and educa- 
tional reform 
were greatly 
needed, es- 
poverty and 
lack of ele- 
mentary 
schools for 
the lower 
classes. And yet conditions could scarcely have been worse 
even in France. The terrible poverty of England in 
the early part of the eighteenth century can now be 
imagined with difficulty. The great industrial and 
mining development had not yet begun. Wages were ° 
low, employment was irregular, and the laboring classes, - 
who numbered fully one-sixth of the total population,. 
were clad in rags, lived in hovels, and often went hungry. | 
The opportunities for elementary education had become _ 
greatly reduced. The few elementary schools that re- 
mained after the acts of dissolution under Henry VIIT 
and Edward VI had largely lost their endowments 
through embezzlement or had been perverted into 
secondary schools, and had suffered through a type of 
patronage whereby the master secured a vested interest 
in his emoluments, regardless of his ability or attention 
to duty. Education was further injured by the politi- 
cal and religious upheaval of the times. During the ar- 
bitrary reign of the first two Stuarts, and the civic 
changes and theological controversies of the Common- 
wealth and Restoration, schools were alternately abused 
and neglected. Both sides in turn had the schoolmasters 
of opposing opinions ejected and forbidden to teach. 
Hence it gradually came to be almost impossible for 
the lower classes to educate their children at all, and 
they generally failed themselves to appreciate the value 
of an education.

The Foundation of ‘Charity Schools’ by Endow- 
ment and Subscription.—However, some people of 
_ wealth must have realized the seriousness of the problem 
and their own responsibility in the premises, and before 
the close of the seventeenth century had put forth Charity 
schools were 
started even 
in the seven- 
teenth cen- 
tury, and by 
the middle of 
the eight- 
vigorous efforts at a solution. During the early part of cath a large 
r the century there sprang up a succession of ‘charity 
schools,’ in which children of the poor were not only 
taught, but boarded and sometimes provided with 
‘clothes, and the boys were prepared for apprenticeship 
and the girls for domestic service. The movement for 
the establishment of these schools for the lower classes 
" by endowment or subscriptions reached its height during 
the comparative peace and toleration that followed the

subscriptions. 
were even made a generation before this change of — 
. government, and for about sixty years they steadily 
continued. Through such bequests the opportunities 
for elementary education were much increased, and it 
“was estimated in the middle of the nineteenth century 
that anywhere from one-third to one-half of all the 
schools then in existence were the product of endowment 
in this period. According to an investigation of the 
Charity Commissioners at that time, some eight or 
nine hundred elementary schools had come down from 
these days, and, if the diversion of numerous endow- 
ments is taken into account, there must have been at 
least one thousand schools founded during the period. 
Of these ‘charity schools,’ however, a great many were 
not founded through endowment. In fact, the term has 
always included and has more generally been applied to 
the institutions established and maintained by private 4 Numerous

subscriptions. These arose in England for the most 
part after the movement toward endowed schools was 
well under way, but similar institutions had also been 
established in Wales in the latter half of the seventeenth 
century, especially through the efforts of Thomas Gouge. 
Gouge was among the English clergy ejected from 
their charges by the Act of Uniformity in 1662. By 
means of contributions from wealthy Londoners, he 
set up schools in eighty-six of the chief towns and 
parishes, and was soon having about twelve hundred 
poor children taught to read and write English and cast 
accounts. In 1674, to receive and manage the necessary 
funds for his work, he organized a corporation composed 
of churchmen and nonconformists, and at his death 
seven years later there were by this means over three 
hundred free schools maintained in Wales. . 
The Charity Schools of the Society for the Promo- 
tion of Christian Knowledge.—In England itself the 
great majority of ‘charity schools’ were established 
through the ‘Society for the Promotion of Christian 
Knowledge’ (often abbreviated to S. P. C. K.). In 
order to counteract the low ebb in religion, morals, and 
education that still prevailed toward the close of the 
century, this society was founded in 1698 by Rev. 
Thomas Bray, D.D. (1656-1730) and four other clergy- 
men and philanthropists. Its chief project and that 
which is especially pertinent here, was “to set up cat- 
echetical schools for the education of poor children.” 
As a rule, these S. P. C. K. charity schools were estab- 
lished, supported, and managed by local people, but the 
society guaranteed their maintenance, assisting them 
from its own treasury whenever a temporary stringency
-P-A-G-E-57
PHILANTHROPY IN EDUCATION 39 
in local funds occurred. Before long the local sub- 
scriptions were often supplemented by endowments and 
by systematic church collections, for which sermons 
were preached at stated periods. The S. P. C. K. also 
inspected the schools, advised and encouraged the local 
managers, and furnished bibles, prayer books, and 
catechisms at the cheapest rates possible. It made 
stringent regulations of eligibility for its schoolmasters. 
Every one of them had not only to stand all the usual 
tests of religious, moral, and pedagogical efficiency, but 
to be a member of the Church of England, at least 
twenty-five years of age, and to be approved by the 
minister of his parish. Each master was required to 
teach the children the catechism of the church twice a 
week and “more largely inform them of their duty by 
the help of the Whole Duty of Man.’ He was also to 
“take particular Care of the Manners and Behaviour 
of the Poor Children,” and purge them of lying, swear- 
ing, Sabbath breaking, and other vices. This religious 
training was given them in addition to the regular work 
in reading, writing, and “the Grounds of Arithmetick, 
to fit them for Service or Apprentices.” Parents were. 
also required, under penalty of their children’s being 
dismissed from the school, to see that the cliildren did 
not absent themselves, save for sickness, and that they 
came to school cleanly and neat. Besides being edu- 
cated, the pupils were clothed, boarded, and at times 
even lodged. : 
As a result of the efforts of the S. P. C. K., the charity 
schools in London and throughout England and Wales 
increased by leaps and bounds. During the first three 
years at least a dozen of these institutions sprang up in These schools 
undertook to

London, and by the close of the first decade there were 
within a radius of ten miles of London eighty-eight 
schools, with an attendance of 2,181 boys and 1,221 girls. 
The subscriptions had grown to nearly £4,200, and the 
special collections to almost half as much again, while 
the gifts from the beginning had amounted to £9,517. 
Nearly one thousand boys and over four hundred girls 
had been sent out as apprentices. Moreover, there were 
two hundred and fifty schools elsewhere in England and 
twenty-five in Wales. After another decade the charity 
schools increased to over twelve hundred and had an 
attendance of nearly twenty-seven thousand pupils, 
while before the middle of the eighteenth century the 
total number of charity schools in England and Wales 
reached nearly two thousand, with about fifty thousand 
boys and girls in attendance. This increase in facilities 
for the education of the poor was not kindly received 
by many in the upper classes, who would often have 
agreed with Mandeville in his Essay on Charity Schools 
that ‘there is no Need for any Learning at all for the 
meanest Ranks of Mankind: Their Business is to Labour, 
not to Think: Their Duty is to do what they are com- 
manded, to fill up the most servile Posts, and to perform 
the lowest Offices and Drudgeries of Life for the Con- 
veniency of their Superiors, and common Nature gives 
them Knowledge enough for this Purpose.” On the 
other hand, the charity schools had the warm support 
of the numerous advocates of religious and social re- 
form. Many of these philanthropists, indeed, were over- 
sanguine in their estimate of what these schools were des- 
.tined to.accomplish. Joseph Addison even went so far 
as to say: “TI have always looked on this institution of

Charity Schools, which of late years has so universally 
prevailed through the whole nation, as the glory of the 
age we live in... . It seems to promise us an honest 
and virtuous posterity. There will be few in the next 
generation who will not at least be able to write and read, 
and have not an early tincture of religion.” But while While tater 
the benefactions for these institutions continued to came less ef-

the eighteenth century popular interest had waned. 4 jesponsi- 
The subscriptions began to fall off, the system of in- bility for the 
spection became less effective, teachers again came to of national 
be regarded as having a vested interest, and the schools schools. 
ceased to expand. Nevertheless, the Society for the 
Promotion of Christian Knowledge had succeeded in 
impressing the Church of England with a sense of re- 
sponsibility for the establishment of a national school 
-system upon a religious basis. The S. P. C. K. schools 
were largely continued throughout the eighteenth cen- 
tury, and were in most instances absorbed after 1811 
by the ‘National Society for Promoting the Education 
of the Poor in the Principles of the Established Church.’ + 
Some of the best of these foundations have even existed 
until the present day upon an independent basis. The ‘Gravel

of their own. The first of these foundations was thi 
‘Gravel Lane School,’ founded in Southwark, London, 
in 1687, “for the instruction of children in reading, 
writing, and arithmetick, and the girls in sewing and 
knitting, and furnishing them with books for their 
instruction in these arts, and with Testaments, Cate- 
chisms, and Bibles.” This school was maintained by 
voluntary subscriptions, annual collections, and lega~- 
cies, and the number of pupils soon rose from forty 
at the beginning to over two hundred. Half a dozen 
other such nonconformist institutions seem to have been 
established in London during the early part of the eight- 
eenth century. By the middle of the century there were 
in the metropolis at least five charity schools belonging 
to the Presbyterians, three to the Independents, two to 
the French Protestants, and one to the Quakers, and 
before the close of the century there must have been 
sixty charity schools founded in various parts of England 
and Wales by different nonconforming denominations. 
pnd *drcalate Later there was also founded in Wales an interesting 
were also - type of philanthropic institution known as ‘circulating 
founded in schools.’ These institutions simply aimed to teach 
pupils to read the Bible in Welsh, and when this had 
been accomplished in one neighborhood, the school was 
transferred to another. Their organization was begun in 
1737 by the Reverend Griffith Jones, but in their support 
they were largely assisted by the S. P. C.K. Under the 
management of Jones over one hundred and fifty thou- 
sand children and adults were taught to read through 
some three thousand of these schools, and under his 
successor, who continued the organization until 1779, 
there was an even larger number of schools and pupils,

"~ The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in 
Foreign Parts, and Its Charity Schools in America.— 
The charity school movement of the mother country 
also had a counterpart in the American colonies. A 
number of earlier charity schools were started in America 
by various organizations, but most of the institutions of 
this sort developed during the eighteenth century 
through an offshoot of the Society for the Promotion of 
Christian Knowledge. This association had from the 
first contemplated religious education in the colonies as 
well asin England. Dr. Bray undertook the commissary- 
ship of Maryland for the Bishop of London with the 
understanding that he should be assisted in providing 
libraries and schools in America. Before starting for the 
colony himself, he sent over many missionaries, and 
furnished libraries and money to be used in education. 
While schools never came to be organized in America by 
the society, it was evidently intended that they should 
be encouraged in time, but before any definite action 
could be taken, the other work in the colonies had grown 
tosuch proportions that Bray deemed it wise toorganizea 
separate society to manage education. Thus, three years 
after its own creation, the Society for the Promotion of 
Christian Knowledge gave birth to the ‘Society for the 
Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts’ (commonly 
knowWnlas the ‘S. P. G.’), and after 1701 the parent as- 
sociation was enabled to limit its efforts largely to the 
homefield. Through liberal subscriptions and wiseinvest- 
ments the S. P. G. eventually came to have a fund of its 
own amounting to over £400,000. Missionaries were sent 
to America in 1702, and soon spread through all the 
colonies, but no schools were founded for several years. The S. P. G. 
was founded 
in xyor for 
missionary 
and educa- 
tional work in 
America.

guaranteed from the beginning, it was not until many 
years later that the expense of clothing the children was 
provided. Under different masters and with varying 
fortunes, the school was supported by the society until 
1783, when the United States had finally cut loose from 
the mother country and started upon a career of its own. 
Meanwhile Trinity Church had come more and more to 
take the initiative in the support of the school, and 
finally accumulated an endowment of £5000. The 
institution came to be known as ‘Trinity Church School,’ 
and ever since the withdrawal of the society from 
America, it has been continued under that name.

Shrewsbury, and Second River in New Jersey. The 
S. P. G. schoolmasters seem to have: been likewise 
active,in all the other colonies, except Virginia. 
All these schools, except for size and local peculiarities, 
closely resembled that in New York City. The attend- 
ance ranged from eighteen or twenty pupils to nearly 
four times that number. From one-quarter to one-half 
of them were taught gratuitously. Girls were generally 
admitted, and occasionally equalled or exceeded the 
boys in number. As a rule, children of other denomina- 
tions were received on the same terms as those of Church 
of England members, and at times nearly one-half the 
attendance was composed of dissenters, but often those 
outside the Church were given secondary consideration, 
or the catechism was so stressed by the school that the 
dissenting children were withdrawn and rival schools set 
up. The character of the course of study in these charity 
schools is further indicated by the books furnished by 
the society. In packets of various sizes it sent over 
hornbooks, primers, spellers, writing-paper and ink- 
horns, catechisms, psalters, prayer books, testaments, 
and bibles. [There is also some evidence that secondary 
instruction was carried on intermittently in the various 
centers by the missionaries or by the schoolmasters in 
conjunction with their elementary work. ‘The character 
of the work done. by the society’s schools varied some- 
what. | Some masters were notoriously inefficient, but 
as a whole they ranked above the average of the times.

church similar to that of England, and both sides dis- 
played considerable sectarianism and bigotry. After 
1750 the opposition to the society increased in bitterness 
and became more general, owing to the feeling that its 
agents were supporting the king against the colonists. 
It was gradually forced to give up its schools, and by 
1783 had entirely left the country. Yet its patronage of 
schools was most philanthropic and important for 
American education in the eighteenth century. While 
it insisted upon the interpretation of Christianity 
adopted by the Church of England, it stood first and 
foremost for the extension of religion and education to 
the virgin soil of America. It carried on its labors with 
devoted interest and showed great generosity in the 
maintenance of schools. Where it refused to establish a 
school or made any retrenchment, the action can gen- 
erally be explained through an actual lack of funds or a 
want of codperation on the part of the colonists. The 
hope was frequently expressed that the people of the 
colonies would soon be able to assist in the support of 
these charity schools, or to assume the entire charge 
themselves, but, except for the aid given in New York 
by Trinity Church, the time never came. Nevertheless, 
the support of schools in the colonies by the S. P. G. 
exerted some influence toward universal education, and 
among the colonists where the Church of England pre- 
vailed it afforded the nearest approach to a public 
school system. It can hardly be claimed that the so- 
ciety would have encouraged a genuine state support 
and control of schools, but it certainly furnished a 
generous example and paved the way for such an edu- 
cational policy.

Charity Schools among the Pennsylvania Germans.— 
During the eighteenth century the efforts of the S. P. G. 
were supplemented by the formation of minor associa- 
tions and the establishment of other charity schools in 
various colonies. The most noteworthy instance was 
the charity school movement among the German sects 
_of Pennsylvania. The Germans had come to the colony 
‘in the early part of the century at the invitation of Penn. 
They had there found peace and content, and by the 
middle of the century they numbered not far from one- 
half of the entire population. But the educational 
facilities, on account of their poverty, the sparseness of 
population, and the dearth of efficient schoolmasters, 
soon proved inadequate, both in quantity and quality. 
An attempt to improve these conditions was made in 
1751 by raising funds among the Calvinists in Holland 
and Scotland, and through an appeal to the S. P. G. 
in 1753 by Provost Smith of the new College at Phil- 
adelphia (afterward the University of Pennsylvania). 
In addition to the arguments of religion and education, © 
Dr. Smith urged the political reason that “by a common 
Education of English and German Youth at the same 
Schools, acquaintances and connexions will be formed, 
and the English language and a conformity of manners 
will be acquired.” In response to his petition, an addi- 
tional fund of £20,000 was raised through contributions 
by the S. P. G., the royal family, and the proprietaries 
of the colony. This fund, ‘from the interests of which 
free schools were here to be established and sustained, 
was placed in the hands of certain trustees, constituting 
A Society for Propagating the Knowledge of God among 
the Germans.” In accordance with a plan of Smith’s, Through con- 
tributions

S. P. G. and

a number of 
charity 
schools were 
started among 
the German 
settlers of

about the 
middle of the 
century, and

  while the aid 
was with-

stitutions

   there was appointed a general colonial board of 
trustees. One or more of the trustees were to visit each 
of the schools annually and award one prize for the best 
oration in English by a boy of German parentage, and 
one for the best oral examination passed by any boy in 
civil and religious duties. The course of study included 
instruction in “both the English and German languages; 
likewise in Writing, keeping of common accounts, 
Singing of Psalms, and the true Principles of the holy 
Protestant Religion.” 
It had been planned to establish twenty-five such 
schools, but owing to lack of funds, insufficiency of 
teachers, and quarrels as to location, there were prob- 
ably always less than half that number. In the va- 
rious schools and at different seasons of the year, the 
attendance ranged from twenty-five to sixty-six, and at 
most the number of pupils accommodated at any one 
time in all the charity schools must have been well under 
one thousand. The schools lasted only about a decade. 
From the beginning the minor sects—Dunkers, Men- 
nonites, Schwenkfelders, Moravians, Siebentagers—eyed 
them with suspicion, and later the Lutherans and Cal- 
vinists were likewise persuaded that this English school- 
ing threatened their language, nationality, and institu- 
tions. The resulting opposition ultimately led to their 
abandonment by the S. P, G. and the king. Yet the 
organization of these institutions left some good results. 
They stimulated the Germans to provide schools to 
maintain their own language and religion, they helped 
unify the people of Pennsylvania, and paved the way for 
the establishment of a system of public schools in 1834.4

Robert Raikes and the ‘Sunday School’ Movement 5 Sunday for 
in Great Britain—A variety of charity school, quite instruction | 
different from those already mentioned, sprang up in in Teller 
England toward the close of the century under the name ments were, 
of ‘Sunday schools.’ The reputed originator of these Gloucester, 
institutions was Robert Raikes (1735-1811) of Gloucester, ae in 
England. This city was a manufacturing center, and Robert 
child labor, with all the attendant ignorance, vice, and Rs 
squalor, was everywhere in vogue. Several clergymen 
and philanthropists of the vicinity had s$ught with 
more or less success to improve conditions by gathering 
children and adults together on Sunday for instruction 
in religion and the rudiments, but until the time of 
Raikes no general system arose, and the Sunday schools 
scarcely spread to the neighboring parishes. The success 
of Raikes came largely through the publicity he was able 
to give the institutions in the columns of his Gloucester 
Journal, the proprietorship of which he had inherited 
from his father.~He opened his first Sunday school in 
‘Sooty Alley’ in 1780 under the direction of a Mrs. 
Meredith, whom he paid a shilling each Sunday to train 
the children. After six months he started a new school 
in Southgate street under Mrs. Mary Critchley, and 
further schools were soon established. The formal 
instruction in these Sunday schools was very rudimen- 
tary. It consisted at the best in teaching the pupils to 
read in the Bible, spell, write, and absorb the elements of 
religion. The religious training did not emphasize any 
particular creed, and was not obscured by sectarian 
bitterness. But even so mild an attempt at reform 
could not pass unchallenged by the conservatives. The 
upper classes held that “the lower orders of mankind   
 
-P-A-G-E-68

are incapable of improvement,’ and feared that, unless 
the masses were kept in their place, there would be a 
social upheaval in England like that going on at the 
time in France. The poor, on their side, were suspicious 
of “people taking pains to bestow benefits without 
having some selfish object,” and declared that “reading 
only serves to make poor folk proud and idle.” Yet 
the new movement was not without warm and influen- 
tial friends among the nobility and others interested 
in reform, and Wesley even incorporated Sunday schools 
as one of the features of his religious ‘societies.’ 
In fact, despite opposition, the Sunday schools were a 
success from the start, and soon spread from the county 
of Gloucester to all corners of the United Kingdom. As 
early as 1784, schools of this type were opened in London, 
and the year following a general Sunday School Society 
was founded. In the course of a decade this organiza- 
tion distributed nearly one hundred thousand spellers, 
twenty-five thousand testaments, and over five thousand 
bibles, and trained approximately sixty-five thousand 
pupils in a thousand schools. The Sunday schools that 
appeared in Wales were probably independent in their 
origin, although they may have been stimulated by the 
Raikes movement. They were largely developed through 
a clergyman of Bala, named Charles, who started them 
in 1785 as the best substitute within his means for the 
former ‘circulating schools’ of Jones,’ and instructed 
adults as well as children. Even in Scotland, where 
religious instruction in the family was excellently or- 
ganized, there was a ‘Sabbath Evening School’ founded 
in 1797. Eight years before, Sunday schools were 
1 See p. 42.

formally organized in Down County, Ireland, and were 
thence extended to Dublin and other centers. The 
Channel Islands, Jersey and Guernsey, also opened 
similar institutions during the early part of the nine- 
teenth century. Hence before the death of Raikes 
there were nearly half a million pupils in the Sunday 
schools of the British Isles, and by the middle of the 
century the attendance had grown to two and one-half 
millions. Meanwhile the teachers had gradually come 
to serve without pay and to instruct less efficiently, and 
the schools had largely given up all training save the re- 
ligious. An investigation of the London Sunday schools 
in 1858 revealed the fact that the teaching was “‘cer- 
tainly not secular, but as purely as possible religious.” 
In no instance were pupils instructed in writing, “and 
reading was taught only incidentally and by means of 
Bible lessons.”” Nevertheless, the Sunday schools were 
continued as a nominal part of secular education until 
the public system was started in 1870, when they came 
_40 occupy the distinctly religious field of the present day. 
“ The ‘Sunday School’ Movement in the United 
States.—The Raikes system of Sunday instruction was 
also soon introduced in America. Sunday schools had 
not been uncommon in the colonies even more than a 
century before this, but they had been exclusively for 
religious teaching. The first school on the new basis 
was organized in 1786 by Bishop Asbury at the house of 
Thomas Crenshaw in Hanover County, Virginia, in 
the hope of combating the ignorance, infidelity, and 
sectarianism that were rampant after the American 
revolution. Within a quarter of a century a number of 
other schools arose at Charleston, Pittsburg, Pawtucket Sunday 
schools of the 
Raikes type 
were likewise 
organized in 
various cities 
of the United 
States, and a 
little later as- 
sociations 
were formed 
for promoting 
this kind of

(R. 1.), Boston, New York, Paterson (N. J.), Stockbridge 
(N. Y.), Albany, and elsewhere. In these communities 
schools were provided for the laboring classes, whose 
children were generally very ignorant and vicious, and, 
as in the British movement, the teachers were at first 
usually paid. The chief texts used were the speller and 
hymn-book. But the organization of the system in the 
United States soon became more extensive than these 
isolated cases of Sunday schools. In 1791 the first per- 
manent association for promoting Sunday instruction, 
‘The First Day or Sunday School Society,’ was organized. 
at Philadelphia. It arose from the lack of free schools 
in the city and the need of improving material and 
intellectual conditions. It was formed by prominent 
men of several creeds, and was purely nonsectarian. 
By the close of the century it was training over two 
thousand children. During the first two decades of the 
nineteenth century a number of similar societies for 
secular instruction on Sunday were founded in New York, 
Boston, Philadelphia, and elsewhere. In 1823 these 
associations were all absorbed into a new and broader 
organization, called the ‘American Sunday School 
Union.’ For a time this society continued secular 
instruction. It published suitable reading-books, and 
furnished primers, spellers, testaments, and hymn-books 
to needy Sunday schools at a reasonable rate, but it has 
gradually come to confine itself to the publication of 
religious literature and the encouragement of religious 
instruction. In fact, after the first quarter of the nine- 
teenth century the prevailing tendency in the Sunday 
schools of the United States was to substitute voluntary 
teachers and purely religious training for the system of

Raikes. The growth of free education everywhere in 
America has gradually rendered secular instruction on 
Sunday unnecessary. 
Value of the Instruction in ‘Sunday Schools.’— While the 
In fact, the value of secular instruction in both British 
and American Sunday schools was not large at its best. 
These institufions were not unimportant in their effect 
upon the extension of education, but their work was 
necessarily limited to a few hours once a week, and their 
secular training was always subordinate to the religious. 
And finally, when the teachers became voluntary, the 
instruction was rendered with more zeal than ability, 
and the'secular element in the content gradually dis- 
appeared altogether. Both Raikes and all others in- 
terested in these institutions recognized their inade- 
quacy as a means of securing universal education, and 
regarded them merely as auxiliary to a more complete 
system of instruction. But while a makeshift and by 
no means a final solution for national education, they 
performed a notable service for the times, and, like all 
philanthropic schools, helped point the way to a system 
of universal instruction at public expense.! 
Lancaster’s School in Southwark—It has been 
evident that while most varieties of philanthropic 
education came into existence in the eighteenth century, 
some of the schools continued into the nineteenth. This 
was even more the case with the schools of the ‘monito- 
rial’ system, which became prominent entirely within 
the first half of the latter century. This system may be 
said to have started in 1798 with a school for the children

of the poor, opened in Southwark, London, The teache: 
was Joseph Lancaster (1778-1838), an English Quake: 
only twenty years of age. The youthful philanthropist 
had come to feel that “the want of system and order is 
almost uniform in every class of schools within the reach 
of the poor.” To overcome the lack of organization and 
the resulting illiteracy, he undertook to educate as 
many of the bare-foot and unkempt children of the dis- 
trict as he could. His school-room was soon crowded with 
a hundred or more pupils, and, in order to teach them all, 
he used the older scholars as assistants. He taught the 
lesson first to these ‘monitors,’ and they in turn imparted 
it to the others, who were divided into equal groups. 
Each monitor cared for a single group. The work was 
very successful from the first, and Lancaster called 
further attention to it in 1803 by an account he pub- 
lished under the title of Improvements in Education as 
it respects the Industrious Classes of the Community. He 
also lectured on his methods throughout England and 
established ‘monitorial’ schools everywhere, and it was 
generally believed that an effective means had at length 
been found for educating everyone with little cost. 
Lancaster, however, proved most reckless, and_his ven- 
ture had by 1808 plunged him deeply in debt. Having 
rescued him from the debtors’ prison, certain philan- 
thropic men of means in that year founded ‘The Royal 
Lancasterian Institution,’ to continue the work on a 
practical basis. But within half a dozen years, Lancaster 
withdrew from the association and started a school of 
his own. A few years later he left England for foreign 
lands, where he again met with failure and poverty, and 
finally died in the city of New York, a disappointed man.

The ‘British and Foreign’ and the ‘ National’ So- 
cieties.—Yet the organization for perpetuating his work, 
which after the withdrawal of Lancaster became known 
as ‘The British and Foreign Society,’ continued to 
flourish and perform a splendid service for education. 
So successful was it that the Church of England began 
to fear its liberalistic influence upon education. Follow- 
ing the nonconformist attitude of its Quaker founder, the 
education of the society included religion and reading the 
Bible, but permitted no catechism or denominational 
instruction of any sort. To most Anglican churchmen 
such religious teaching seemed loose and colorless, and 
in 18iz ‘The National Society for Promoting the Educa- 
tion of the Poor in the Principles of the Established 
Church’ was founded by them. This long-named 
association was to use the ‘monitorial’ system, and to 
have a Doctor Bell as its manager. Andrew Bell (1753- 
1832) had been an army chaplain and the superintendent 
of an orphanage in India, and had the idea of monitorial 
instruction suggested to him by the Hindu education. 
A year before Lancaster opened his school, Bell had 
published his treatise known as An Experiment in 
Education Made at the Male Asylum of Madras; and 
while the Quaker philanthropist began his system inde- 
pendently, it is not unlikely that he received help later 
from Bell. Although they formed no part of Bell’s origi- 
nal methods in Madras,. the catechism and the prayer 
book were now taught dogmatically in the schools founded 
by the National Society, and as Bell proved an admirable 
director, the affairs of the organization prospered mar- 
velously. In consequence, a healthy rivalry with the 
older association of the Lancasterians rapidly grew up. and the Brit-

56 A HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
The Systems of Lancaster and Bell.—‘Monitorial’ 
or ‘mutual’ instruction, however, was'not original with 
either Lancaster or Bell. Besides being used by the 
Hindus,! it has formed part of the Jesuit system of 
education,” was practiced by Trotzendorf in his school,* 
and was confidently recommended by Comenius in his 
Didactica Magna.* Nevertheless, it was the work of 
The system of Lancaster and Bell that greatly developed the method Lancaster was as ‘ broader than and brought it into prominence. The plans of the two 
Rat jf th men, while analogous, differed somewhat in spirit and 
Society, and details. Without considering the methods of religious 
daborate. instruction, the system of Lancaster was generally 
animated by broader motives. While he failed to teach 
certain subjects, it was simply because his resources 
were limited; but the National Society purposely cur- 
tailed the range of its instruction on the ground that 
“there is a risk of elevating those who are doomed to the 
drudgery of daily labour above their station, and ren- 
dering them unhappy and discontented with their lot.” 
In the matter of details, both men worked out systemat- 
ically the idea of instructing through monitors, and 
both used a desk covered with sand as a means of teach- 
ing writing; but in other respects Lancaster elaborated 
the method more than Bell. By having the speller or 
other text printed in large type and suspending it from 
the wall, he made one book serve for a whole class, or 
even for the entire school. Through the use of slates and 
dictation he had five hundred boys spell and write the

same word at the same time. He arranged a new method 
in arithmetic whereby any child who could read might 
teach the subject with accuracy. Moreover, he in- 
stituted company organization, drill, regimental control, 
precision, and a prompt observance of the word of 
command. He also developed a system of badges, 
tickets, offices, and other rewards, and, in order to avoid 
flogging, a set of punishments by which the offender was 
made an object of ridicule rather than physical pain. 
There were likewise a number of unessential differences 
between the two systems. 
Value of the Monitorial System in England.—Neither 
Bell nor Lancaster deserves much praise as an educa- 
tional reformer. Each was vain and pedagogically 
ignorant, and saw but one side of education. While both 
societies accomplished much good at a time when little 
attention was given to instruction and less to the prob- 
lems of education, the monitorial systems overemphasized cal 
repetition in the teaching process and treated education 
purely from the standpoint of routine. The monitorial 
- _ method was not real instruction, but a formal drill. It 
had no principles and little of the elasticity that was 
apparent in the more psychological methods of the re- 
formers on the Continent. The mechanical basis of such 
a system is exposed by the arithmetical boast of Lan- 
caster. He calculated: “Each boy can spell one hundred 
words in a morning. If one hundred scholars can do 
that two hundred mornings yearly, the following will 
be the total of their efforts at improvement.” He then 
shows that there will be an annual achievement of two 
million words spelt. Similarly, in arithmetic he seems 
to hold that it is simply a question of the number of The monitor-

Yet the Lancaster-Bell schools were productive of 
some achievements. Most of them afforded a fair educa- 
tion in the elementary school subjects and added some 
industrial and vocational training. They also did much 
to awaken the conscience of the English nation to the 
need of general education for the poor, and the system 
emphasized the school as an organized community for 
mutual aid. The British and Foreign and the National 
Societies. afforded a substitute, though a poor one, for 
national education in the days before the government 
was willing to pay for general education or the denom- 
inations were able to furnish it, and they became the 
avenues through which such appropriations as the 
government did make were distributed. In 1833 the 
£20,000, constituting the first aid to elementary educa- 
tion, was equally divided between the two societies,’ 
and this method of administration was continued as the 
annual grant was gradually increased, until universal 
public education was enacted. Likewise, in 1839, 
£10,000 for normal instruction was voted to the societies, 
and was used by the British and Foreign for its Borough 
Road Training College, and by the National for St. 
Mark’s Training College. These were followed by several 
other training institutions established by each society 
through government aid. In 1870, when the ‘board,’ 
or public elementary, schools were at length founded,? 
the schools of the British and Foreign Society, with their 
nonsectarian instruction, fused naturally with them; 
but the institutions of the National Society, though

transferred to school boards in a few cases, have generally 
come to constitute by themselves a national system on a 
valuntary basis. 
UResults of Lancasterianism in the United States.— 
In the United States, where complete freedom in religion 
obtained, the system of Dr. Bell and the National 
Society found little footing. The monitorial system in its 
Lancasterian form, however, was introduced into New 
York City in 1806, The ‘Society for the Establishment 
of a Free School,’ after investigating the best methods 
in other cities and countries, decided to try the system 
of Lancaster.1 The method was likewise introduced 
into the charity schools of Philadelphia. The monitorial 
* system then spread rapidly through New York, Penn- 
sylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and other states. 
It is almost impossible to trace the exact extent of this 
organization in the United States, but before long it 
seems to have affected nearly all cities of any size as far 
south as Augusta (Georgia), and west as far as Cincinnati. 
There are still traces of its influence everywhere through- 
yut this region —in Hartford, New Haven, Washington, 
Baltimore, and Albany, as well as in the cities already 
mentioned. In 1818 Lancaster himself was invited to 
America, and assisted in the monitorial schools of New 
York, Brooklyn, and Philadelphia. A dozen years 
later the system began to be introduced generally into 
the high schools and academies. Through the efforts of 
Dr. John Griscom, who had been greatly pleased with 
the monitorial high school of Dr. Pillans in Edinburgh, 
a similar institution was established in New York City 
in 1825, and the plan was soon adopted by a number

Likewise, the state system of academies in Maryl 
and in Indiana, which became high schools after 
Civil War, was organized on this basis. For two decad 
the monitorial remained the prevailing method in secon

Lancasterian basis also became common. 
In fact, the monitorial system was destined t:

. to the ever increasing expenditures and taxation that 
d had to be made before satisfactory schools could be 
| established. Hence the introduction of Lancasterianism 
.; may well be considered to have provided a basis for 
.| the substantial public support of education now universal 
in the United States. 
Moreover, the Lancasterian schools were not only 
economical, but most effective, when the educational 
conditions of the times are taken into consideration. 
Even in the cities, the one-room and one-teacher school 
was the prevailing type, and grading was practically 
unknown. The whole organization and administration 
was shiftless and uneconomical, and a great improvement 
'| was brought about by the carefully planned and detailed 
| methods of Lancaster. The schools were made over 
through his definite mechanics of instruction, centralized 
management, well-trained teachers, improved apparatus, 
| ‘discipline, hygiene, and other features. We can, then, 
well understand the enthusiasm for these new schools 
that is apparent in the utterances and writings of 
statesmen, educators, and other persons of the times that 
felt responsible for the training of the people. One of 
the earliest and best known estimates is that of De Witt 
Clinton, afterward (1817-23 and 1825-28) governor of 
New York, who in 1809 declared in his address at the 
dedication of the new building of the Free School Society: 
“When I perceive that many boys in our school have been 
taught to read and write in two months, who did not before know 
the alphabet, and that even one has accomplished it in three 
weeks—when I view ail the bearings and tendencies of this sys- 
tem—when I contemplate the habits of order which it forms, the 
spirit of emulation which it excites, the rapid improvement which and the work

it produces, the purity of morals which it inculcates—when I 
behold the extraordinary union of celerity in instruction and 
economy of expense—and when I perceive one great assembly of 
a thousand children, under the eye of a single teacher, marching 
with unexampled rapidity and: with perfect discipline to the goal 
of knowledge, I confess that I recognize in Lancaster the bene- 
factor of the human race. I consider his system as creating a 
new era in education, as a blessing sent down from heaven to re- 
deem the poor and distressed of this world from the power and 
dominion of ignorance.” ! 
But while the monitorial methods met a great educa- 
tional emergency in the United States, they were clearly 
mechanical, inelastic, and without psychological founda- 
tion. Naturally their sway could not last long, and as 
public sentiment for education increased, and enlarged 
material resources enabled the people to make greater 
appropriations for education, the obvious defects of the 
monitorial system became more fully appreciated and 
brought about its abandonment. Before the middle of 
the century its work in America was ended, and it gave 
way to the more psychological conceptions of Pestalozzi 
and to those afterward formulated by Froebel and 
Herbart. 2 
‘Infant Schools’ in France.—Another form of phil- 
anthropic education that came to be very influential 
during the nineteenth century and has eventually been 
merged in several national systems is that of the so-called 
‘infant schools.’ These institutions may be said to have 
started with Jean Frédéric Oberlin (1740-1826), Lutheran 
pastor in Ban de la Roche, a wild district in the Vosges 
1¥For Clinton’s complete eulogy of the system adopted by the Free 
School Society, of which he was president, see Bourne, History of the

Mountains of Northeastern France. Among the institu- 
tions that the young minister opened in every village 
were ‘infant schools’ for very young children. In these 
schools he endeavored to inculcate morality and religion, 
as well as to teach the elements of reading, writing, and 
arithmetic. The Scriptures, natural history, and geog- 
raphy were taught through pictures, maps, and drawing; 
and excursions to search for flowers and other products 
of nature were taken. The older children also learned 
to knit and spin, and meanwhile the younger were 
allowed to play. These infant schools did much to dis- 
pel ignorance, immorality, and shiftlessness, and soon 
spread into various parts of France. 
Among the institutions inspired by this example, 1 
was the salle d’ hospitalité (‘room of entertainment’), 
which was opened at Paris in 1801. It did not last 
long at the time, but a quarter of a century later it 
was revived through a study of the infant schools that 
had meanwhile grown up in England, and it then rap- 
idly expanded into a system. In 1833 these institutions 
were adopted as part’ of the French national system of 
education, and in 1847 a normal school was founded to 
prepare directresses “and inspectors for them. In 1881 
they became permanently known as écoles maternelles 
(‘mother schools’), and the curriculum was given its 
present form.? These schools have striven to fulfill-a 
function of their own, and not imitate the formal educa- 
tion given older children. Besides reading and writing, 
they have always included exercises in the mother 
tongue, drawing, knowledge of common things, the 
elements of geography and natural history, manual

and physical exercises, and singing. In place of the 
elements of religion, with which the schools started, the 
secularized cutriculum now furnishes the first principles 
of moral education. 
Robert Owen and his ‘Infant School.’—Quite in- 
dependently, though over a generation later than Ober- 
lin’s work, an ‘infant school’ was opened in 1816 at 
New Lanark, Scotland. The founder was Robert Owen 
(1771-1858), a philanthropic cotton-spinner, who en- 
deavored to put certain theories of social reform into 
practice near his factory. Up to his time poor children 
from six to eight years of age had been sent to the fac- 
tories, and were required to labor from six in the morning 
until seven in the evening. After these hours they 
attended night school, but they were generally too 
fatigued ‘“‘to acquire much proficiency in education, and 
many of them became dwarfs in body and some of them 
deformed.” Instead of employing children so early, 
Owen wished them “to acquire health and education 
until they were ten years old.” At first he was able to 
have only the older children trained, but seven years 
later he bought out his conservative partners and put 
into practice his scheme for the education of very young 
children. For this an ‘infant school’ was started in the 
lower story of the so-called ‘New Institution.’ Children 
were received at the age of three, and were given a care- 
ful moral and physical training. They were taught for 
two or three years whatever was useful and within their 
understanding, and this instruction was combined with 
much singing, dancing, amusement, and out-of-door ex- 
ercise. They were not ‘annoyed with books,’ but were 
taught about nature and common objects through maps,
-P-A-G-E-83
PHILANTHROPY IN EDUCATION 65 
models, paintings, objects from nature, and familiar 
conversation, and their “‘curiosity was excited so as to 
ask questions respecting them.” ‘ : 
For this almost Pestalozzian training Owen found it 
difficult to get the right teachers, but he at length secured 
“a poor simple-hearted weaver named James Buchanan, 
who at first could scarcely read, write, or spell,” but who, 
by following the instructions of Owen literally, made a 
great success of the school. Owen published his methods 
in his New View of Society, and the work at New Lanark 
attracted a great deal of attention both in Europe and 
America, But the socialistic and free thought opinions 
held by Owen soon offended many of his supporters, and 
the management of the school was at length taken away 
from its founder. In 1823 he came to the United States 
and started a communistic society at New Harmony, 
Indiana, in which for a short time he continued his 
theories of education. In this plan he codperated with 
William McClure and Joseph Neef,! who were interested 
in spreading the Pestalozzian doctrines and practices, 
and was assisted by his son, who had been educated with 
Fellenberg at Hofwyl.? 
‘Infant Schools’ in London and the Work of Wilder- 
spin.—Before this, however, the infant school at New 
Lanark had been copied in 1818 at Brewer’s Green, 
Westminster, by a group of peers and distinguished men. 
Buchanan, who had been transferred to London by Owen 
at their request, took charge of the school. While it was 
intended to have the Westminster school based upon the 
principles in use at New Lanark, Buchanan seems, 
when placed upon his own responsibility, to have been 
1 See p, 150. 2See p. 153ff. While Owen 
soon left the 
work and 
went to the

too lacking in intelligence and force to accomplish this. 
He was soon obliged to withdraw, and the school was 
closed within a decade, but it proved largely the source 
of inspiration for Samuel Wilderspin (1792-1866), who 
was destined to become the leading exponent of the 
‘infant schools’ for Great Britain and America. Wilder- 
spin started a school in Spitalfields, London, on the 
same basis as that at Westminster, but he soon put for- 
ward the claim: “‘Mr. Owen’s institution was intended 
merely for an asylum; I alone had the merit of inventing 
what is now known in this country by the name of the 
Infant System.” The school at Spitalfields, which was 
opened in 1820, was immensely successful. Through the 
large number of visitors it attracted, and half a dozen 
books that Wilderspin produced upon infant schools, 
some weight was lent to his claims. 
The infant schools of Wilderspin were far more me- 
chanical than those of Owen, but they had some similar 
principles underlying them. For example, the school was 
organized on the basis of a family, and much attention 
was given to developing kindly feelings, morality, and 
codperation. Recreation and physical exercises on a 
playground were provided, as well as mental and, moral 
training. For this, various apparatus, amusements, and 
games were used, especially those imitating occupations. 
A peculiar grouping of the children for receiving object 
Jessons was invented by Wilderspin. This ‘gallery,’ as he 
called it, was effected through a succession of steps, the 
highest of which was occupied by the oldest child and the 
lowest by the youngest. For teaching the children to. 
count, he also employed an instrument of his own, called 
the ‘arithmeticon,’ which consisted of a number of balls
-P-A-G-E-85
PHILANTHROPY IN EDUCATION 67 
ina frame of wires. The defects of the system were most 
apparent. Wilderspin thought too highly of ‘books, 
lessons, and apparatus,’ and confounded instruction 
with education. He overloaded the child with verbal 
information, depending upon the memory rather than 
the understanding. Before the child was six, it was 
expected that he had been taught reading, the funda- 
mental operations in arithmetic, the tables of money, 
weights, and measures, a knowledge of the qualities of 
common objects, the habits of different animals, the 
elements of astronomy, botany, and zodlogy, and the 
chief facts of the New Testament. Wilderspin did not 
himself understand object teaching, and confused words 
with things. His method was catechetical and mechan- 
ical, and, to assist the memory in carrying its heavy 
burden, the lessons were often made rhythmical or put 
into rhyme. Even the games were stereotyped, and 
the religious teaching was most formal. Despite the 
attempt to train the feelings, ‘natural depravity’ was 
inculcated as a prime tenet. 
Development and Spread of the ‘Infant Schools.’— Though 
While not the real founder of infant schools, Wilderspin ; 
certainly gave them vogue. He lectured upon the sub- 
ject throughout the United Kingdom, often demon- 
strating his methods with classes of children he had taken 
along, and organized infant schools everywhere. In 1824 
an ‘Infant School Society’ was founded through sub- 
sctiptions, with the Marquis of Lansdowne as president, 
and while it lasted only sixteen years, it was remarkably 
active during this period. It was reported the year 
following the society’s organization that: thirty-four new 
schools were opened and that fourteen more were nearly

ready, and this increase continued throughout the sub- 
sequent years of the society. In 1829 Wilderspin also 
visited Scotland at the invitation of David Stow (1793- 
1864) of Glasgow,! who had three years before established 
infant schools upon a modified plan of his own. He 
adopted the playground and ‘gallery’ of Wilderspin, 
but was much less mechanical and memoriter in his 
method, and broader in his purpose. 
An important organization for training infant school 
teachers, known as ‘The Home and Colonial School So- 
ciety,’ ? was established at London in 1836. The founder 
of the society was a retired civil officer, but the most in- 
fluential members were James Pierrepont Greaves (1777- 
1842) and Rev. Charles Mayo, D. D. (1792-1846), who had 
studied with Pestalozzi at Yverdon. Through them it was 
decided to extend Pestalozzi’s principles to the poor, and 
the society undertook to graft Pestalozzianism upon the 
infant school stock. Object teaching and the training 
of the senses were emphasized rather than verbal training 
and the use of the memory. A great improvement in 
observation took place in the infant schools, but even 
then there was still too much imitation of the formal 
instruction of older children, and memorizing of material 
not fully understood. Moreover, there remained a tend- 
ency to cultivate infant prodigies by an appeal to emula- 
tion and by public exhibitions, which puffed up the 
brilliant pupils and quite discouraged the mediocre. A 
1A detailed account of this visit is found in Wilderspin’s Early Disci- 
pline, Chaps. VI-X. 
2This association was founded as ‘The Home and Colonial Infant 
School Society,’ but in 1845 the words ‘and Juvenile’ were inserted in the 
title, to show a widened purpose, and, when this proved too cumbrous, 
the name was reduced to the form given in the text above.

training college was opened, and after 1843 the course 
became greatly improved through Mayo’s sister, Eliza- 
beth, who arranged to give all her time to the institution, 
The work of Wilderspin, Stow, and the Home and 
Colonial School Society was so influential that infant 
schools spread rapidly in Great Britain, and were 
adopted as a regular part of the public system, when it 
was established in 1870. Schools for children between 
three and seven were organized in a separate department 
under the guidance of a trained teacher. Improvements 
were gradually introduced into the methods of these 
infant schools. By 1874 a marked change was made 
through merging in them some of the methods and games 
of the kindergarten. 
Schools open to all younger children likewise sprang 
up generally in the United States. They first arose to- 
ward the end of the first quarter of the nineteenth cen- 
tury, but for many years were not regarded as an essen- 
tial part of the public school system, and were managed 
separately. The establishment of these schools in Amer- 
ican cities and their gradual fusion with the public 
system is of sufficient importance to demand separate 
consideration. 
‘P ‘Primary Schools? in Boston—In Boston one of 
the most influential factors in bringing about the estab- 
lishment of these schools for younger children was the 
introduction of Sunday schools.!_ Through these institu- 
tions were discovered the illiteracy of three-fourths of 
the poor children in attendance, and the need of their 
learning to read, if any attention were to be given to 
religion. As pupils were not admitted to the public

schools until they could read and write, and as many of 
the parents were unable to teach their children themselves 
and could not afford the slight expense of the ‘dame’ 
schools, a considerable number of children were alto- 
gether debarred from even an elementary education. 
Hence those citizens actively engaged in the work of re- 
ligious and philanthropic associations became interested 
in the agitation for ‘primary schools.’ After two peti- 
tions and much discussion in town meeting, in 1818 the 
first modest appropriation, $5000, was made for ‘primary 
schools,’ ‘to provide instruction for children between 
four and seven years of age.’ While the ‘Primary School 
Committee’ was nominally a sub-committee of the city 
board of management, it was in effect a separate organiza- 
tion. By 1844 the weakness of the organization and 
methods in this dual school system had become apparent, 
although Horace Mann met with great opposition in 
his endeavors to improve the situation. The Primary 
School Committee remained a separate body for a 
decade longer, but all public schools were in 1854 con- 
solidated and the existing committees merged in a single 
organization. These primary schools were divided into 
four grades, beginning with the study of the alphabet 
and closing with reading in the New Testament. Besides 
reading, writing, and spelling, sewing and knitting were 
taught the girls, since their poverty made these ac- 
complishments useful. As a whole, a formal course of 
instruction and the ‘monitorial’ system 1! were employed 
until about 1840, when the primary schools became 
generally permeated with the subjects and methods 
started by Pestalozzi.?

“ ¢Infant Schools’ in New York and Other Cities— 
Schools for younger pupils were first opened in New York 
almost a decade later than in Boston. In 1827 an ‘Infant 
School Society’ was organized there to furnish the means 
of instructing poor children between three and six years 
of age, and an ‘infant school’ was opened in the basement 
of the Canal Street Presbyterian Church. A ‘junior 
department’ was also established in the basement of 
‘School No. 8,’ where hitherto, as in the case of the other 
institutions belonging to the ‘Public School Society,’ * 
the pupils of all grades had been taught on the ‘monitor- 
ial’ ? basis in a single department. Early the following 
year a committee of the Public School Society visited 
these two infant schools. They were much pleased with 
the Pestalozzian principles they saw embodied there and 
pronounced them “‘a judicious combination of instruction 
and amusement, ... calculated to form and elicit 
ideas, rather than mere literal knowledge, though this 
was by no means neglected.” They recommended the 
continuance’ of the ‘junior department’ and the estab- 
lishment of an ‘infant school’ in the basement of ‘School 
No. 10,’ and this was shortly done. Hence, while the 
infant schools came under the immediate control of the 
Public School Society, they were really the offspring of 
the Infant School Society, and after some discussion, it 
was decided to use the Pestalozzian system rather than 
the Lancasterian. Although both societies would have 
been glad to extend the number of infant schools, they 
were for a time prevented by financial and legal con- 
siderations. In 1830, however,- these schools became 
known as the ‘primary departments’ of the schools in

which they were located, and thereafter formed a regular 
feature of all the Public School Society’s institutions. 
A committee was appointed in 1832 to examine the 
Society’s schools and suggest improvements. Upon the 
recommendation of two of this committee, who had in- 
spected education in Boston, primary schools were 
established in rented rooms in sufficient numbers to 
be within easy reach for the young children. The 
subject-matter and methods were likewise made less 
formal. 
In the same year that the first infant school was 
opened in New York, three similar institutions were 
founded in Philadelphia and other centers in Pennsyl- 
vania through Robert Baux. By 1830 the number of 
infant schools in the state had risen to ten, with two to 
three thousand pupils. As the numbers would indicate, 
the schools were largely organized upon the Lancasterian 
plan. Two years later a model infant school was started 
in Philadelphia, and in 1834 six others were organized. 
By 1837 there were thirty primary schools in Philadelphia 
alone. Several other cities started infant schools early. 
Hartford began them in 1827, and Baltimore in 1829. 
These institutions were in most cases fostered by the 
leading men of the community, and the ultimate service 
performed for American education by this form of 
philanthropy was considerable. Among other improve- 
ments, the infant schools developed a better type of 
school-room, secured separate rooms for different classes, 
introduced better methods and equipment, encouraged

a movement toward playgrounds, and brought women 
into the city schools of the United States. 
The Importance of Philanthropic Education —Many 
other types of charity school arose during the eighteenth 
century both in Great Britain and America, but the chief 
movements have been described, and sufficient has been 
said to indicate the important part in education played 
by philanthropy. The moral, religious, and economic 
condition of the lower classes had been sadly neglected, 
and by means of endowment, subscription, or organized 
societies, a series of attempts was made to relieve and 
elevate the masses through education. As a result, 
charity schools of many varieties and more or less per- 
manent in character arose in all parts of the British Isles, 
the United States, and even France. In many instances 
the pupils were furnished with lodging, board, and 
clothes. The course in these institutions was, of course, 
mostly elementary. It generally included reading, 
spelling, writing, and arithmetic, while a moral and 
religious training was given through the bible, catechism, 
prayer book, and psalms, and sometimes through attend- 
ance at church under supervision of the master. Fre- 
quently industrial or vocational subjects were taught, or 
the pupils apprenticed to a trade or domestic service. 
The course was usually most formal both in matter and 
method, but occasionally in the later types drawing, 
geography, nature study, physical exercises, and games 
were added, and the more informal methods of Pestalozzi 
or Froebel were partially employed. Sometimes the 
training was especially intended for and adapted to 
children under the usual school age.

the conception of the importance and value of education to society was greatly enlarged, and the need of a gen- 
erous financial support was gradually recognized. These 
institutions were a makeshift to relieve the burdens of 
the poor and were ofttimes sectarian and narrow in their 
attitude, but they became the foundation for a com-

istic_of the American schools has throughout been the 
attempt of a free people to educate themselves, and, 
through their elected representatives, the people of the ~ 
various states have now come, in harmony with the 
genius of American civilization, to initiate, regulate, 
and control their own systems of education. (The univer- 
sal, free, and secular schools of the United States are a 
natural accompaniment of its republican form of govern- 
Ment. But, like the new democracy itself, this develop- 
ment of popular education was not reached at a bound. 
he American schools are the offspring of European 
institutions, and have their roots deep in the social a 
which the coloni; 
At first they resembled the schools of the mother coun- 
tries as closely as the frontier life in the new world would 
permit. In American education the seventeenth century 
was distinctly a period of transplantation of school; s, with 
little or no conscious change, and it is only toward: the 
middle of the next century, as new social and political 
conditions were evolving and the days of the Revolution 
were approaching, that there are evident a gradual 
modification of European ideals and the differentiation 
of American schools toward a type of their own. This 
period of transition from inherited ideals is not marked 
off until the eighteenth century and the first half of the 
nineteenth, and the’ purely American coneéption of 
education cannot be fully discerned before the middle of 
the latter century.

institutions that have come into America from Europe. 
But in the rest of our study of educational history the 
practices of education in the new world will become 
increasingly distinctive and influential, and, to get at 
their origins, we must now turn back in our narrative to 
the early part of (the seventeenth century and briefly 
consider the social and educational situation in Europe, 
especially England and Holland) This may seem like 
a serious breach both in logic aiid chronology, Gut only 
in the light of the conditions out of which they sprang 
can the developed ideals _and_practices of universal 
public education in the United States be really u1ider- stood. 
The thirteen American colonies were started while the 
fierce agitations of the Reformation period were still at 
their height. (The settlers, for the most part, were 
Protestants, and many of them had emigrated in order 
‘o establish institutions—political, ecclesiastical, educa- 
cional—that would conform to their own ideals, and in 
ul cases education in the new world was given a peculiar 
flicts of the-old. At this time in practically all the 
states of Europe, educational institutions were controlled 
and supported by the church and religious orders, with 
the assistance of private benevolence; but a few schools 
everywhere, and especially in Teutonic countries, were 
maintained by pre-Reformation craft gilds, and so had a 
close connection with municipalities. Thus the American 
schools at first naturally adopted the religious conception 
of education and ecclesiastical domination, but had some 
acquaintance with free schools and municipal manage- 
ment. In addition to these characteristics, the religious

reformers, like Lu tither and Calvin, generally held to the 
idea that a system of schools s should be supported, or at 
‘least established, by the state, and that all children 
should have an opportunity to secure an education 
sufficient to make them familiar with the Scriptures) 
If people were to be guided by the word of God, théy 
must all be able to read it) But this view of education 
was not held by those for whom, as in the English Church, 
the Reformation was’ not primarily a religious and 
theological, but rather an ecclesiastical and political Wherever ue

Calvinism prevailed, universal education was upheld by Eatherasism .

education, both secondary and elementary, for the 
__ children of the wealthy, and some provision of the old 
English industrial training through apprenticeship for 
orphans and children of the poor, but no such institution 
as a public elementary school was at first known. Vir- 
ginia, the oldest of these provinces, may serve as a 
_ type. This colony constituted the first attempt of Eng- 
land at reproducing herself in the new world, and here are 
found an order of society, form of government, established 
church, and distinction between classes, similar to those 
of the mother country. The gentry or landowning class 
perpetuated the methods of educating their families 
that were customary in England, while the masses, in- 
cluding the landless, the indentured servants, and other 
dependents, were without any means of formal instruc- 
tion. . 
Hence we find that the educational legislation in 
colonial Virginia concerns itself mainly with (z) the 
organization of a college or university, (2) individual 
schools of secondary grade, and (3) apprenticeship 
education for the poor. During the first quarter of a 1 
century most educational efforts were in behalf of the 
foundation of an institution of higher learning, and were ti 
aided by the king, the Anglican bishops, and the London 
Company. By 1619 over £2000 and a grant of ten thou- 
sand acres of land had been obtained for a university at 
Henrico, but this rather indefinite plan was brought to a 
violent end by the Indian massacre of 1622, and the 
funds were diverted to a school in the Bahamas. An 
even more fruitless endeavor to found a college was made 
in 1624 by Sir Edwin Palmer upon an island in the Sus- 
quehanna. During this period also there was at least Hence educa-

one abortive attempt to establish a school by collections 
and gifts, and during the second quarter century of the 
colony there were chartered a number of secondary 
schools, endowed with bequests of land, money, cows, 
horses, slaves, or other property. These schools, however, 
were local, and resembled the endowed Latin schools of 
England, except that they may sometimes have been 
obliged by circumstances to include more or less elemen- 
tary instruction. By 1660 a number of these colonial 
secondary schools had been chartered, and in that year 
there was a renewed attempt to establish by subscriptions 
a college ‘and ‘free’ ! school ‘for the advance of learning, 
education of youth, supply of the ministry and promotion 
of piety.” But none of the efforts at founding schools 
could have been very successful, for, a decade later, when 
interrogated as to what kind of education existed in the 
colonies, Governor Berkeley made his famous reply: 
“The same course that is taken in England out of towns; every 
man according to his ability instructing his children. . ... I thank 
God there are no free schools, and I hope we shall not have them 
these hundred years; for learning has brought disobedience,and 
heresy and sects into the world.” 
However, despite these biassed remarks of the testy 
governor, by 1692 the constant efforts to obtain an 
institution of learning were finally rewarded. Through 
the management of the Reverend James Blair, D. D.,

twenty thousand acres of land, and the right to certain \ 
colonial taxes were obtained from the king, and large 
donations were made by the planters and additional 
support provided by the assembly. In fact, the college 
was munificently endowed for the times, and it did a 
great work in training the greatest scholars, statesmen, 
judges, military officers, and other leaders during the 
struggle for independence. Moreover, ‘free’ schools now 
greatly increased in number and their courses were much 
improved, and sons of the more prominent families were 
often sent to. England or the Continent to be educated. 
But education was throughout this early period regarded 
as a special privilege, and the masses were mostly em- : 
ployed in making tobacco, and other manual pursuits. | 
For the sons of these people the only educational legisla- 
tion was that provided between 1643 and 1748 in various 
acts concerning the industrial training of the poor, 
apprentices, wards, and orphans. In keeping with 
English precedents, these children were taught a trade 
by the masters to whom they were indentured, or trained 
in the flax-house established by public funds at James 
City.

‘ 
genuine public education began to appear. The leader 
in the movement was the great statesman, Thomas 
Jefferson. As early as 1779, he first introduced into the 
legislature a scheme of universal education. His Dill 
proposed to lay off all the counties into small districts 
five or six miles square, to be called ‘hundreds.’ Each 
hundred was to establish at its own expense an elemen- 
tary school, to which every citizen should be entitled to 
send his children free for three years, and for as much 
longer as he would pay. The leading pupil in each school 
was to be annually selected by a school visitor and sent 
to one of the twenty ‘grammar’ (i. e. secondary) schools, 
which were to be erected in various parts of the state. 
After a trial of two years had been made of these boys, 
the leader in each grammar school was to be selected and © 
given a complete secondary course of six years, and the 
rest dismissed. At the end of this six-year course, the 
lower half of the geniuses thus determined were to be 
retained as teachers in the grammar schools, while the 
upper half were to be supported from the public treasury 
for three years at the College of William and Mary, 
which was to be greatly expanded in control and scope. 
This comprehensive plan for a system of common 
schools was, in the face of most discouraging opposition, 
constantly adhered to by Jefferson, although he did not 
live to see universal education an accomplished fact. 
He did, however, stimulate some movements toward 
this end. In 1796 the legislature passed an ineffective 
law whereby the justices of each county were permitted 
to initiate a school system by taxation, and in 1810 
a ‘literary fund’ was established for public educa- 
tion. When, in 1816, this fund had been increased to a
-P-A-G-E-105
RISE OF THE COMMON SCHOOL 87 
million dollars, those in charge of it recommended to the 
legislature the establishment of “a system of public 
education, including a university, to be called the 
University of Virginia, and such additional colleges, 
academies, and schools as should diffuse the benefits 
of education through the Commonwealth.” This revision 
of Jefferson’s suggestion did not immediately result in 
any legal steps toward universal education, except the 
appropriation in 1818 of $45,000 from the income of the 
literary fund to have the poor children of each county 
sent to a proper school, but it did bring about in 1820 
the foundation of the University of Virginia and a 
generous grant for the erection of a set of buildings. 
In the same year the effectiveness of the ‘permissive’ 
law for common schools of 1796 and of the appropriatiop 
_ act of 1818 was somewhat strengthened by the division 
of the counties into districts, among which the appro- 
priation for education of the poor was distributed and 
managed by special commissioners. ; 
While this law marked one more step in savance, | 
it was hampered by several of the features that in various 
states continually delayed the establishment of common 
schools at public expense. In the first place, it was based 
on the conception of public education as poor relief, 
rather than universal training for citizenship. It was 
often viewed with hostility or indifference by the wealthy, 
who felt that they were paying for that from which they 
received no benefit, and with pride and scorn by the poor, 
who refused to be considered objects of charity. More- 
over, the sum distributed ($45,000) was totally inad- 
equate for over one hundred thousand children, and 
every variety of school, private as well as public, was
-P-A-G-E-106
  88 A HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
subsidized without distinction. The system lacked a 
‘voor schook’ Strong central organization, and the commissioners, often 
appointed by the county judges from the classes most d : . : 
totally inad- opposed to the arrangement, were notoriously inefficient. 
The teachers also were generally incompetent, as it was 
practically impossible to persuade college or academy 
way for pub- graduates to undertake the instruction of the pooy. 
lic education.’ Nevertheless, under this apology for a people’s commgn eel 
— school, the state went on for a score of years, and there 
was a steady growth in the literary fund, the appropria- 
tions, the length of the school term, and the number of 
pupils who were willing to take advantage of such oppor- 
tunities as it afforded. State officials of wide vision, 
moreover, sought in every way to improve the teaching 
corps and the defective administration. While the great 
majority of the school children still attended the denom- 
inational, private, and ‘field’ schools, this system of sub- 
sidies was educating public opinion for something better. 
By the close of the first half century of statehood, while 
Virginia was not yet ready to establish a complete system 
of public education, we shall later 1 see that the ground 
had been prepared for the development of common 
schools that was spreading throughout the country. 
y Peculiarities in the Other Southem Common- 
wealths.—In general, the laissez faire foundation of 
schools and colleges during the colonial period, and the 
slow development of an approach to a system of public ed- 
ucation during the first fifty years of independence, which 
was evident in Virginia, is found to be typical of the four 
other colonies of the South. Practically all of themseem to 
have begun with the aristocratic and semi-feudal society

and education inherited from England, and to have been 
handicapped in their evolution of public schools by the Es 
wide separation of households, Indian wars, poverty... .. 
and the subsidizing of private schools. { But the problems 
“were in every case a little different, and in each there 
were variations in development that are worthy of 
special attention. Maryland, for example, while mainly 
following the same random foundation of schools as Vir- 
ginia, also made a determined attempt to support schools 
in every county by a general colonial tax. In 1696, 
through encouragement and gifts from the governor, 
and general subscriptions from legislators and others, 
the assembly was enabled to pass an act to establish a 
county system of ‘free’ ! schools, and authorize a corpora- 
tion to manage them and receive bequests and donations. 
Eight years later the fund for these schools was increased 
by a duty upon various imports and exports, and ‘be- 
tween 1723 and 1776 several acts concerning the land 
endowment, support, and administration of these institu- 
tions were passed. Thus Maryland undertook a new 
movement in secondary education, and while the plan Maryland,

met with little success before the Revolution, it even- 
tually resulted in a county academy system with a 
permanent annual subsidy. Unfortunately, these acad- 
emies, being close corporations, somewhat delayed the 
establishment of common schools, but during the first 
half century of statehood, Maryland, like Virginia, 
began to move slowly toward universal education by sub- 
sidizing the education of the poor (1816) and by the 
passage of a ‘permissive’ law for common schools in the 
counties (1825).

schoolmaster approved by the vestry of any parish £10 
per annum and to grant £12 towards a parish school 
building. The parish system, however, did not prove 
much more of a success than the county arrangement, 
and most of these schools, while well subsidized, were 
first organized after the Southern method of local en- 
dowment by some individual or of support by some 
philanthropic society. Early in the nineteenth century, 
however, the sentiment for universal. education began 
to develop. While, prior to the Civil War, South Car- 
olina never established a ‘literary,’ or permanent school 
fund, and failed to provide an administrative organiza- 
tion of schools, an annual appropriation for ‘free schools’ 
was started in 1811. A law was passed establishing a 
number of schools in each election district equal to that of 
its members in the legislature and providing $300 for 
each school. While this act was intended to produce 
universal education, its terminology, giving preference 
to poor orphans and children of indigent parents where 
the school facilities were limited, caused a social dis- 
crimination against the free schools to arise, and they 
came to be regarded largely as pauper institutions. 
Moreover, because legislative representation was based 
‘upon property, the distribution of the appropriation was 
very inequitable, and the inland parts of the state, which 
most needed assistance in providing schools, received 
the least.. However, despite poor organization and 
management, the amount of the appropriation was

education continued to develop.

hundred chartered academies had arisen, and from 1825 
to 1838 the state appropriated some $25,000 annually 
_ to secondary schools, mostly county academies. But 
a tuition fee was charged for this training, and, except 
for subsidized education of the poor, these institutions 
were largely limited to the dominant classes. Yet, while 
little was' done toward providing elementary education 
before the general development of common schools 
(1835-1860), an administrative organization had been — 
furnished, a permanent school fund had been started, 
and sentiment for public education had begun to grow.

an influential 
‘middle class,’ 
formulated a 
system of 
public schools 
(1816) and 
established a 
common, 
school fund 
(1825). 92 A HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
North Carolina, as the reselt- ofa more influential ‘ ‘mid- 
dle class,” made much ess_ toward common 
schools than any other Southern state. The colony had 
been originally settled in the seventeenth century under 
English proprietors, but after its sale to the crown in 
1728, a large number of Irish and Scotch Presbyterians, 
German Protestants, and other immigrants, mostly from 
Pennsylvania, came in and formed a vigorous opposition 
to the aristocratic ecclesiastical and civic policy of the 
colonial government. While they were closely repressed 
before the Revolution, with the beginning of national 
life they started the agitation for public education. /The 
constitution of 1776 provided for the establishment of 
schools and a state university by the legislature, 
state soon possessed a vigorous institution o: 
learning and a large number of academies. By avi,, ov 
the request of the legislature, Judge Archibald D. 
Murphy, a statesman with broad educational traditions, 
even formulated an elaborate plan for a complete system 
of public schools. This scheme failed, because it proposed 
to ‘maintain,’ as well as educate, the children of the poor. 
But the suggestions of the Murphy committee shortly 
brought about the establishment of a ‘literary,’ or com- 
mon school fund (1825), the income of which was to be 
used for the support of public schools. Eventually this 
fund was enlarged by most of North Carolina’s share of 
the ‘surplus revenue’ money,-which was distributed by 
the national government among the several states in 
1837, and, early in the educational development of 
1835-60, enabled North Carolina to maintain by far 
the best system of public instruction in the South. 
In the case of the other Southern commonwealths,
-P-A-G-E-111
RISE OF THE COMMON SCHOOL 93 
which were admitted after the union had been formed, 
there was similarly a very gradual growth of sentiment 
for universal education. While each state had its own 
peculiar obstacles, the educational development in them 
all was sufficiently like that already described in the 
five original states to make further details unnecessary. 
In every state of the South there was appearing an 
alliance between far-sighted statesmen and educators 
and the great middle class of citizens for the purpose of 
establishing common schools for all white children, and 
the old ecclesiastical and exclusive idea of education 
was beginning to fade. {By the close of the first half 
céntury of national existence, a public system had 
not actually materialized in any of the states, but most 
of them had begun to create ‘literary funds,’ sub- 
sidize schooling for the poor, and enact ‘permissive’ 
laws for establishing public schools. Except in Virginia 
and South Carolina, provisions had been made for a gen- 
eral administrative organization in state, county, and dis- 
trict; and in North Carolina the common school system 
awaited only a first hint of the great educational awaken- 
ing. (1835-60) to become full-fledged. Moreover, most 
of the larger cities—Baltimore, Charleston, Savannah, 
Louisville, Nashville, Memphis, Mobile, New Orleans— 
had already organized a regular system of public schools, 
and all of the older commonwealths had made some 
attempt at supporting a state institution of higher 
learning, which was virtually the head of a public school 
system. The various denominations had begun to found 
colleges in some numbers, but even these institutions 
were not so strictly ecclesiastical as William and Mary 
started out to be, and assumed a wider function than There was a

merely training for the ministry, while the aristocratic 
and classical ‘grammar’ schools had largely given way 
to the ‘academies,’ which were non-sectarian, demo- 
cratic, and more comprehensive in their curriculum. 
The Parochial Schools and Further Development in 
the Colony and State of New York.—A second main 
type of educational organization appears in colonial 
New York, or New Netherlands, as it was called during 
Dutch days (1621-1674). In contrast to the laissez faire 
attitude of Virginia, the foundation of schools was 
parochial. Instead of the chance endowment of schools 
wherever the benefactors happened to be located, a 
school was founded in connection with every church. 
This arrangement grew out of the Calvinistic conception 
of universal education, which formed an essential part 
of the social traditions in Holland during the seventeenth 
century. Long before the Dutch came to America, the 
parochial school, as a means of preserving the Reformed 
faith, had become an indispensable part of church 
organization. But the Dutch state also had concerned 
itself with the facilities for education. The Reformed 
Dutch Church was granted the right to examine teachers, 
enforce subscription to the creed, and, in the case of 
the elementary schools at least, largely determine the 
appointments, but the legal support and control of 
education were vested in the civil authorities.1 Hence 
there early arose in New Amsterdam and the villages 
of New Netherlands a parochial school system and a 
distribution of control between church and state very

, RISE OF THE COMMON SCHOOL 95 
similar to that in Holland. Besides the ordinary elemen- 
tary branches, these parochial schools of the New 
Netherlands taught the ‘true principles of Christian 
religion,’ and the catechism and prayers of the Reformed 
Church. Thus the Dutch schools differed from those in 
the Anglican colonies of the South, which stressed 
secondary education, in being chiefly elementary, al- 
though some attempt at conducting a Latin school was 
also made in New Amsterdam from 1652 on. However, 
after the English took permanent possession of New York 
(1674), the parochial school of the city was limited to the 
support of the Reformed Church, and, as a result of its 
long refusal to adopt the English language, its possible 
influence toward the realization of universal education 
was completely lost. While the Dutch schools of the 
villages generally retained the joint control and support 
of the local court and church, with a constantly increasing 
domination of the former, as a whole the English occupa- 
. .tion of New York would seem to have set public education 
back about one hundred years. 
At any rate, during the eighteenth century New 
York seems to have fallen into the laissez faire support 
of education that we have seen prevailing in the Southern 
colonies. ‘The upper classes largely sought their educa- 
tion abroad or through tutors and the clergy, although 
in 1754 King’s College (now Columbia University) was 
founded, and during the century a number of secondary 
schools were organized and granted gratuities by the 
legislature. And the few elementary schools that 
existed were either private or maintained by some 
church or philanthropic society. As already shown,’

schools taught

to secure their share of the state donation. Much 
progress was brought about through the first superintend- 
ent, Gideon Hawley, and while, after eight years of 
service, he was removed by political manipulation and 
the office combined with the secretaryship of state, each 
of his successors undertook to distinguish the educational 
side of his administration by some marked advance or 
improvement in the common schools. But for a genera- 
tion the academies and colleges remained under super- 
vision of the regents, and, except for state appropriations 
to academies, no one undertook to extend the public 
system into secondary and higher education. Moreover, 
the professional training of teachers in the academies 
was encouraged by the state, and thereby the organiza- 
tion of normal schools was delayed. Hence, while New 
York started the first system of public education ad- 
Justed to the political and social conditions of the new 
nation, and probably had the most effective schools of 
the times, not until the great period of common school 
development (1835-1860) were its people fully willing to 
contribute for a general public school system, make it 
entirely free, or develop it consistently in all direc- 
tions. 
‘NO New York City.—Meanwhile, an interesting develop- 
ment of educational facilities was taking place in New 
York City. In 1805 the opportunities offered in the 
private, church, and charity schools were seen by certain 
of the most prominent citizens to be totally inadequate 
for a city of seventy-five thousand inhabitants, and a 
‘Free School Society’ was founded to provide for the boys 
who were not eligible for these schools. The president 
. was De Witt Clinton, afterward governor, and, as we with the’ sen

have seen,! in 1806 the first school was opened, from mo- 
tives of economy, upon the monitorial basis. The state 
fund did not reach a sufficient amount to be available 
until 1815, but special gifts were made to theschool society 
from time to time by the legislature, the city, and private 
individuals, and there was a rapid increase in the number 
of the society’s schools during the first quarter of a cen- 
tury. In 1826 the legislature authorized the organization 
to charge a small tuition fee and change its name to the 
‘Public School Society.’ While the fee system was soon 
found to injure the efficiency of the work and was 
abolished within six years, the new title persisted, as it 
did not suggest pauperism in the way the old name had. 
In 1828 the society was allowed the benefit of a small 
local tax. For quite a time the work of the association 
was unhindered, but in 1820-25 a vigorous effort was 
made to obtain a share of the state appropriation for the 
sectarian schools of the Bethel Baptist Church. This 
move was finally defeated, but the Roman Catholics 
made a more successful appeal fifteen years later by indi- 
cating that the society, while nominally nonsectarian, was 
really Protestant. To settle this dispute, the legislature 
in 1842 established a city board of education, and after 
eleven years the institutions of the Public School Society 
were merged in this city system. Thus was the way pre- 
pared for a public school system in New York City, and 
this development was typical of the training of educa- 
tional sentiment through quasi-public societies that took 
place in Buffalo, Utica, Oswego, and several other cities.

to that of New Netherlands, except that it was carried 
on in connection with a number of creeds, and that the 
municipality was seldom a coérdinate factor. Under 
Penn’s ‘Frame of Government’ in 1683 ample provision : . of was made for the enforcement of universal education, ; 
but the whole effect was lost the following year by 
modifying it so as to apply only ‘to those having the 
means to do so.’ The proprietary laws were continued 
in the royal colony, and the chief result of this legislation 
was the establishment of institutions of their own by the 
different religious sects. Pennsylvania was more het- 
erogeneous in population than New York, as the tolerant 
attitude of the government had attracted a large variety 
_ of German sects, Swedes, Dutch, English, Welsh, Scotch 
and Irish Presbyterians, and Roman Catholics, and 
each was devoted to its own ecclesiastical schools. In 
1715-all Protestant religious bodies Were authorized to 
conduct schools and to receive bequests and hold land 
for their support, and, although this was vigorously 
opposed by the supreme judiciary in England, it became 
law by the lapse of time. Before this, in 1689, a ‘Friends’ 
Public School’ had been started, which later (1711) was 
known as the ‘Penn Charter School’ and became the 
center of education in Philadelphia. While itself a 
secondary school, it established branch elementary 
schools over the city upon different arrangements. Some 
charged a fee and some were free; some were for boys 
and some for girls. In keeping with the conclusions of 
various ‘Yearly Meetings’ (1722, 1746, etc.), the Friends 
likewise provided elementary, and to some extent 
secondary, schools in close proximity to all meeting- 
houses throughout the colony.

Similarly, the German sects, Presbyterians, Episcopa- 
lians, and Catholics established their own: distinctive 
parochial schools. The Lutheran congregations, ‘for ex- 
ample, each set up a school alongside of the church as 
early as possible; the Mennonites included in their 
system the famous schools of Christopher Dock, who in 
1750 produced the first elaborate educational treatise in 
America; and the Reformed Church, as we previously 
noted,} started a species of charity schools through the 
help of the S. P. G. There was also some attempt at 
secondary and higher education, especially in the case of 
the well-known Moravian institutions at Bethlehem, 
Nazareth, and Lititz, and the Presbyterian Log College 
at Neshaminy, which became the cradle of Princeton, 
Washington and Jefferson, Hampden-Sydney, and Union 
Colleges. A somewhat broader spirit was manifest in the 
voluntary ‘neighborhood’ schools of western Pennsyl- 
vania, in the attempts at universal education of the Con- 
necticut colonists in the Wyoming Valley, and in the 
‘academy’ set up at Philadelphia through Franklin,” to 
train public men and teachers, and fuse the various na- 
tions in a common citizenship. But, as a whole, parochial 
education prevailed and exerted the largest influence in 
Pennsylvania during the eighteenth century. While 
these schools did much to further the modern idea of the 
elementary school, the national, sectarian, and class 
jealousies that ensued kept the authorities from a con- 
sideration of universal education and greatly delayed the 
establishment of a public system of schools.

-P-A-G-E-119
RISE OF THE COMMON SCHOOL 101 
The state system only very gradually arose through 
a prolonged stage of ‘poor schools.’ The new constitu- 
tion (1790) of the state provided: “The legislature shall, 
as soon as conveniently may be, provide by law for the 
establishment of schools throughout the State, in such 
manner that the poor may be taught gratis.” Men of 
broad vision, like Franklin, Benjamin Rush, and Timothy 
Pickering, had striven hard to have popular education 
introduced, but the general sentiment of the times could 
not reach beyond providing free education for the poor. 
Moreover, although this moderate constitutional provi- 
sion was a compromise, it was not for some years (1802, 
1804, and 1809) that the legislature passed acts to make 
it effective. Even then public institutions to fulfill the 
legislation were not established, but the tuition of poor 
children was paid for at public expense in private, church, 
and neighborhood schools. The result of this was that 
most poor parents were too proud to declare themselves 
paupers, and the proceeds of sixty thousand acres of land 
appropriated for ‘aiding public schools’ went to subsidize 
private institutions. But the idea of common schools 
continued to develop, and governors and other prominent 
men constantly called attention to the need of universal 
education. Philadelphia was the first municipality to be 
converted, and in 1818, under a special act of the legisla~ 
ture, it became ‘the first school district of Pennsylvania,’ 
with the power to provide a system of education on the 
Lancasterian plan! at public expense. After three or 
four years this special legislation was extended to five 
more counties, and in 1824 a general law for free schools 
in any community was enacted, though soon repealed.

was not until

most of the 
districts took 
advantage of 
this permis- 
sive law. oz A HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
Finally, in 1828, ‘the Pennsylvania Society for the 
Promotion of Common Schools,’ after demonstrating 
the ineffectiveness of the ‘pauper school’ law in a series 
of memorials, succeeded in having a state school fund 
established, and six years later ‘an act to establish a 
general system of education by common schools’ was 
passed. 
This law established a state system of schools under 
the general superintendency of the secretary of state. 
For this system it appropriated $75,000 per annum 
from the income of the state school fund, and per- 
mitted the wards, townships, and boroughs, which it 
constituted school districts, to share in this, provided 
they levied local taxes for schools. The northern coun- 
ties, settled mostly by New England colonists, and the 
western portion of the state, with its large element of 
Scotch-Irish Presbyterians, ardently favored this en- 
couragement of universal education, but the law was only 
‘permissive’ and was bitterly opposed by the Quaker 
and German inhabitants of ‘old’ Pennsylvania, who 
feared that their own parochial schools would be replaced. 
The wealthy classes were also hostile to the new law, on 
the ground that they ought not to be taxed to educate 
other people’s children. In a vigorous campaign to 
repeal the act, however, the opponents of the law were 
defeated the following year (1835), and the desire to 
establish public schools was greatly increased by the 
enlargement to $400,000 of the annual state appropria- 
tion, in which the school districts might participate only 
on condition of local taxation. Even then not more 
than one-half the districts took advantage of the op- 
portunity, and it was several years before most of them
-P-A-G-E-121

claimed their share. Hence, while the battle was won 
by 1835, the consummation of public education in Penn- 
sylvania did not take place until the great awakening of 
common schools had swept over the country. 
Early Education in New Jersey and Delaware— 
The two remaining ‘middle’ colonies, New Jersey and 
Delaware, were settled by a variety of nationalities and 
sects,—Swedes, Finns, Dutch, Quakers, Anglicans, and 
Scotch Presbyterians. This extreme cosmopolitanism 
made any real attempt at a general system of public 
education more impossible than in Pennsylvania and 
New York. As in those colonies, the parochial schools of 
the Dutch, the Quakers, the Germans, and the Pres- 
byterians accomplished something for public education, 
but much of the school organization was laissez faire, as 
in Virginia. After the formation of the union, New 
Jersey and Delaware met with the same kinds of hin- 
drance to the development of common schools as did 
Pennsylvania, and they were even slower in getting a 
system established. In both commonwealths a state 
school fund was started early in the nineteenth century, 
but it was not distributed for about.a dozen years, and 
then it was used mostly for the education of paupers in 
subsidized private schools. Some ‘permissive’ legislation The organi-

vailed. Accordingly, Massachusetts may be said to 
have inaugurated the first real system of public education. 
The character of the schools in this colony developed 
from its peculiar form of society and government. It 
was democratic, concentrated, and homogeneous, as 
compared with the cosmopolitan and sectarian social 
structure in the Middle colonies, or the class distinctions 
and scattered population of the South. While there were 
some servants and dependents in the Massachusetts Bay 
Colony and a distinction was made between ‘freemen’ 
and others, there were at no time rival elements that 
were unable to combine. The settlements were not a 
mere confederation, but the blending of all elements 
into a single organism, where the individuality of each 
was merged in a new social whole. This condition was a 
result of the radical ingrained religious conviction that 
every one was a child of God, capable of becoming a 
vital and useful member of society, and that the com- 
munity was obligated to give him training to that end 
in the home, church, and school. Out of this Calvinistic 
attitude sprang a spirit of codperation and helpfulness, a 
general participation of all townsmen in local govern- 
ment, and the Massachusetts type of school organization. 
Common schools seem to have been supported in most 
towns from the first by voluntary or compulsory sub- 
scriptions, and before the close of the first quarter of a 
century there had been established by the colony at 
large an educational system in which every citizen had a 
working share. Because of the exclusiveness and unity 
in matters theological, the schools, while religious and 
moral, could hardly be considered sectarian. The first 
educational act of the colony, passed in 1642, was similar
-P-A-G-E-123
> RISE OF THE COMMON SCHOOL 105 
to the old English apprenticeship law in its provision 
for industrial education, and, while it was broadened 
so as to include some literary elements and a rate to 
procure materials was established, no school is men- 
tioned in it. But in 1647 each town of fifty families was 
required, under a penalty of £5, to maintain an elemen- 
tary school, and every one of a hundred families a 
‘grammar’ (secondary) school.!_ These schools might be 
supported in part by tuition fees, as well as by the 
town sate, and the obligation seems to have still rested 
on the parents to see that the children did ‘resort’ to the 
school, but all the germs of the present common school 
system in the United States would appear to have been 
present in the colony of Massachusetts before the middle 
of the seventeenth century. 
This generous support of public education, however, 
was followed by a period of decline for about a century 
and a half. The causes for this decadence of local 
interest in education have been carefully investi- 
gated,? and found to be rather complicated. In the 
first place, the complete domination of Calvinism grad- 
ually disintegrated and was replaced by a toleration 
of several creeds. The non-Puritans, who were con- 
,Stantly increasing in numbers, were obliged by the law 
of 1638 to preserve an outward conformity to the Cal- 
vinistic regime under penalty of banishment, but by 
1662 @ compromise was granted, whereby persons not 
conforming in every respect might be admitted to all 
church privileges, except communion, and the persecu-

106 A HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
tion of Quakers, Baptists, and other sects was largely 
abandoned. In 1670 came the successful secession of the 
Old South Church from the original church of Boston, 
as the result of a quarrel concerning the compromise just 
mentioned, and within a decade the Baptists were per- 
mitted to build a meeting-house in Boston. By 1692 
recognition had been largely granted to all Protestant 
beliefs, and to be a ‘freeman,’ or voter on all colonial 
questions, it was no longer necessary to be a member of a 
Puritan church. While every town was still required 
to support by tax an orthodox pastor, by 1728 the 
Episcopalians, Quakers, and Baptists were permitted 
to pay their assessments to their own ministers, and the 
alliance of the state with a despotic church, which had 
made possible the systerh of public education, was 
largely broken. Moreover, there was a decided lowering 
of intellectual standards upon the part of the colonists. 
The hard struggle to wring a living from an unpropitious 
soil, and the disturbances due to wars, Indian skirmishes, 
and the difficulties of pioneer life greatly lessened their 
feeling of need for a literary training. Another reason 
for the educational decline was the dispersion of the 
population in the towns, as the best land near the center 
was more and more taken up. The intervening hills, 
streams, swamps, and poor roads, together with the fear 
. Of Indians and wild animals, greatly hindered those on 
the outskirts in reaching the. church and school of the 
town. As a result of these different tendencies, the 
towns, most of which had been eager to establish schools 
even before being compelled to do so, began to seek 
various methods of evading the school law without 
incurring the fine. The minister was at times made the
-P-A-G-E-125
RISE OF THE COMMON SCHOOL 107 
nominal schoolmaster, or a teacher was even employed 
during the session of the ‘General Court’ (. e. legislature) 
and discharged upon adjournment. Laws were enacted 
against these subterfuges, greater vigilance was ex- 
ercised, and the fine was increased first to £10 (1671) 
and then to £20 (1683), with a progressive increase 
where the number of families ran over one hundred 
(1712). Thus the fine came to be sufficient to support a 
schoolmaster, and it was made more and more unprofit- 
able for a town to disobey the law. 
Under these circumstances it became advantageous to 
many citizens, especially those at the center of a town, 
to have the entire support of the school come through 
general taxation rather: than partially by means of 
tuition fees. But the people in the more distant portions 
of the town refused to vote.a rate from which they them- 
selves obtained no profit. They demanded that, in re- 
turn for their taxes, the public school should be brought 
nearer to them. Probably they were influenced in this 
stand by the fact that private ‘dame’ schools, and possi- 
bly elementary schools, had for some time been opened in 
various parts of the town conveniently near their homes. 
Another factor that may have aided in suggesting this 
solution was the legal recognition of various remote 
settlements. within the town, known as ‘parishes’. or 
‘districts,’ through the grant of self-government, separate 
church organizations, and other privileges similar to 
those of the town as a whole, though on a smaller scale. 
At any rate, we find that, in the early part of the eight- 
eenth century, wherever a rate was adopted as the sole 
means of school support, it was agreed that, instead of 
holding the town school for twelve months in the center
-P-A-G-E-126
reached its 
lowest point 
in 1827. 108 A HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
alone, opportunities shouid be offered for a fraction o: 
that period in various portions of the town. When thi 
compromise took the form of having one town maste: 
teach in different districts through the year, the resul 
was known as a ‘moving school,’ but when separat: 
schools under different masters or mistresses came to bi 
taught at the same time, the town school was said to b 
‘divided.’ These divisions were allowed more and mor 
control of their schools by the town until they prac- 
tically became autonomous. Before the time of the 
Revolution ‘divided schools’ were recognized as a regular] 
institution, and, together with other customs that had 
grown up during the eighteenth century, they were 
given legal sanction and denominated ‘district schools’ 
in the law of 1789. By 1800 the districts were not only 
allowed to manage their own share of the town taxes, but 
wereauthorized to make the levy themselves; in 1817 they 
were made corporations and empowered to hold property 
for educational purposes; and in 1827 they were granted 
the right to choose a committeeman, who should appoint 
the teacher and have control of the school property. 
Thus, as Martin describes it, the year 1827 “marks 
he culmination of a process which had been going on for 
more than a century,—the high-water mark of modern 
democracy, and the low-water mark of the Massachusetts 
school system.” ! The district system did in its earlier 
stages bind the families of a neighborhood into a cor- 
poration whose intent was the most vital of human 
needs,—education, and the people came to feel the 
necessity of supporting it by their own generous contri- 
butions. But in the course of time the districts became 
1 Evolution of the Massachusetts School System, p. 92-
-P-A-G-E-127
RISE OF THE COMMON SCHOOL 109 
involved in private and petty political interests, and 
had but little consideration for the public good. The 
choice of the committeeman, the site, and the teacher 
caused much unseemly wrangling, and as each received 
only what it paid in, the poor district obtained only 
a weak school and that for but a short term. The in- 
creasing expense of the district system had also made 
it impossible for any except the larger towns to support 
‘the old-time ‘grammar’ school, and this part of the 
old school requirements had fallen into disuse before 
the close of the eighteenth century. To meet the needs 
of secondary education, the policy of endowing ‘acad- 
emies’ with wild lands in Maine had gradually grown 
up, and this custom was legalized in 1797. Seven acad- 
emies—four in Massachusetts proper and three in the 
province of Maine, had originally been endowed with 
a township apiece, and some fourteen more had been 
chartered by towns at an early date, and empowered by 
the state to hold educational funds. By the time of the 
edueational awakening there were some fifty of these 
private secondary institutions subsidized by the state, 
although managed by a close corporation. The first 
public high school had been established in Boston (1821), 
but this type’of secondary school had not begun to have 
any influence as yet. Into such a decadence had the 
liberally supported system of public education fallen 
before the rapid development in common schools began 
and the influence of Horace Mann and other reformers * 
was felt. Hence during the first quarter of the nine- 
teenth century public education in Massachusetts had 
been quite surpassed by New York, which had largely

outgrown its laissez faire attitude and was now leadin, 
all the states in the development of schools. 
Similar History of Other New England States. 
The development of common schools in Massachuset 
may be considered typical of New England in general, 
with the exception of Rhode Island. During the colonial 
period, Connecticut by the middle of the seventeenth| 
century, and Vermont before the Revolution, had very’ 
closely copied the governmental activity of Massachu- 
setts in organizing schools. The section of the Hartford 
colony law (z650) on ‘children’ reminds one strongly 
of the Massachusetts act of 1642, while the section on 
‘schools’ is an almost verbatim repetition of the Massachu- 
setts law of 1647. Similar provisions were made in the 
New Haven colony before the two were merged in the 
colony of Connecticut in 1661. By the close of the cen- 
tury Connecticut had also granted lands, gratuities, and 
4. taxes for the support of its chief ‘grammar’ schools, and 
had established a fine of £5 upon any town neglecting 
to maintain an elementary school, and double the amount 
in the case of a Latin school. Likewise, by 1766 the 
foundations of a district system had been laid through 
recognizing the divisions in a certain town. In 1794 
these districts were given a separate existence legally and 
allowed to locate their own schoolhouses and levy taxes. 
The results of this step constituted one of the greatest 
problems for Henry Barnard during the great period of 
educational development. Similarly, in Vermont before 
statehood was well under way, provision had been made 
for town and district schools, county ‘grammar’ schools, 
and even a state university, and some legal steps taken 
to see that the towns, districts, and counties lived up
-P-A-G-E-129
RISE OF THE COMMON SCHOOL TIX 
to the statute In the beginning of the second quarter 
of the nineteenth century a state school fund and school 
commissioners were established, but they were abolished 
within a few years, and the schools of Vermont were in a 
parlous condition when the awakening found them. New 
Hampshire was part of Massachusetts until 1693, and 
Maine was until 1820, and their development of popular 
education contains no new features. 
The Early Organization of Education in Rhode Is- 
land.—But Rhode Island would have none of the com- 
mon schools and centralization of education, and until 
well into the nineteenth century tllowed more nearly the 
random organizatiop of schools in Virginia. The colony 
was dominated by ithe idea of freedom in thought and 
speech, for which it had been founded in 1636, and as 
legislation involving the regulation of schools seemed 
to be an interference, if not actual compulsion, it would 
tolerate nothing of the sort for almost two centuries. 
Schools were, however, organized within the first century 
in the chief towns of the colony,—Newport (1640), 
Bristol (1683), Providence (1684), and Portsmouth 
(1726). These schools were voluntarily maintained 
through the rent and sale of local school lands, rent of the 
schoolhouses and their cellars, subscriptions, taxation, 
income from wharves, lotteries, and tuition fees, and 
the management of them was vested in the town meet- 
ings. But these institutions could hardly be considered 
common schools, for they were ungraded and intended 
for the poor. The idea of a free public school for all 
classes was first suggested in 1767 in the report of Moses 
Brown, one of a committee to formulate a plan of educa- 
tion and bring it before the town meeting, but it was Because of its 
idea of free-

naturally not adopted. In 1798, however, the Mechanics 
and Manufacturers’ Association, under the leadership 
of John Howland, and supported by educators and men 
‘of wealth, after a struggle of two years brought about a 
law that permitted each town in the state to maintain at 
public expense ‘one or more free schools.’ Providence 
availed itself of this act and thus started a public school 
system in 1800, but no other municipality paid any 
attention to the law, and it was repealed in 1803. The 
basal state law for common schools was not passed until 
1828, when $10,000 was appropriated and each town was 
required to supplement its share by such an amount as 
should annually be fixed in town meeting. While this 
amount was increased in 1839 to $25,000, and subse- 
quently to much larger sums, the state school system was 
but poor and meager until the influence of the educa- 
tional awakening was felt, and Henry Barnard ! had done 
his work for the state (1843-49). 
The Extension of Educational Organization to the 
Northwest.—It is thus evident that by the close of the 
first half century of the republic, there was everywhere 
slowly growing up a sentiment for public education. 
The development of common schools had, however, been 
greatly hindered in the Southern states by the separation 
of classes in an aristocratic organization of society. 
Yet the superior class had shown no lack of educational 
interest in their own behalf and had through the facilities 
offered reared a group of intellectual leaders, some of 
whom, like the far-sighted Jefferson, had caught the 
vision of universal education. The great diversity of 
nationality and creed in the Middle states, on the other

’ RISE OF THE COMMON SCHOOL 113 
hand, had fostered sectarian jealousies and the traditional 
practice of the maintenance of its own school by each 
congregation. This had proved almost as-disastrous to 
the rise of a system of public schools, although Penn- 
sylvania and even more New York had well begun the 
establishment of a public system. In both sections of 
the country public education was at first viewed as a 
species of poor relief, and the wealthy were unable to 
see any justice in being required to educate the children 
of others. As a result, the young ‘paupers’ at times had 
their tuition paid in private schools, and these institu- 
tions were not infrequently allowed to share in public - 
funds. The New England states, however, as a result 
of the homogeneity of their citizens, had early adhered 
to a system of public schools for all, organized, supported, 
and supervised by the people. While the efficiency of 
their common schools was eventually crippled by the 
grant of autonomy to local districts.and the arising of 
petty private and political interests, they had initiated 
this unique American product,—a public system for all, 
dependent upon local support and responsive to local 
wishes. 
This growth of a ‘common schools consciousness’ was 
destined, as the result of a great educational awakening, 
to increase rapidly about the middle of the nineteenth 
century in the Middle and Southern, as well as the New 
England states. But before describing this development 
further, it is important to see the effect of the ideals of 
these three sections of the country when introduced 
into a new part of the United States by emigrants from 
the older commonwealths. The new domain referred 
to was those large tracts of unsettled territory, belonging,

form but 
slowly, and

according to claims more or less overlapping, to six or 
seven of the original states, and finally (1781), in settle- 
ment of these disputes, ceded to the federal government, 
with the understanding that the territory should be 
‘formed into distinct republican States.’ After much 
discussion and various acts of Congress for half a dozen 
years, the famous ‘Ordinance of 1787’ was passed for 
the government of this ‘Northwest Territory.’ By the 
act the entire territory was divided into townships, six 
miles square, after the New England system, and of the 
thirty-six sections into which each township was sub- 
divided, section sixteen was reserved for the support of 
public schools. Two townships of land were also ded- 
icated for the establishment of a university. This 
policy of educational endowment was later extended 
to the vast territory purchased from France in 1803 
and known as ‘Louisiana,’ and to all the other territory 
afterward annexed to the United States. 
This federal land endowment gave an additional 
stimulus to the establishment of public education in the 
four commonwealths—Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Mich- 
igan—that were admitted from the Northwest Territory 
before 1840. But the final system of public education 
in these new states took form but slowly for various 
reasons. The settlers were poor; incessant Indian wars, 
the wilderness, wretched roads, and lack of trans- 
portation facilities tended to repel immigrants and 
leave the country sparsely settled; the large tracts of 
school land were slow in acquiring value, and, to attract 
settlers, were often leased at nominal rates or sacrificed 
at a small price; and social distinctions and sectarian 
jealousies persisted among the immigrants. As a whole,
-P-A-G-E-133
RISE OF THE COMMON SCHOOL r15 
immigration from the earlier commonwealths had fol- 
lowed parallels of latitude, and the northern parts of 
Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois were occupied mostly by 
people from New England and New York, and the 
southern by former inhabitants of Virginia, Kentucky, 
Tennessee, Louisiana,! and other states where the 
public school system was not yet as well developed. 
In Michigan, however, because of its northerly location, 
the great influx throughout the state had come from 
New York, New England, and northern Ohio. 
Consequently, the history of public education in the 
first three of the new states seems to be in each case 
largely a record of a prolonged struggle to introduce 
common schools among those of the people who had 
come from states not yet committed to this ideal, but 
Michigan, whose inhabitants had migrated from states 
where public education was in vogue, showed the germs 
of a public system even before statehood was conferred. 
The history of the common schools in Ohio, Indiana, and 
Illinois is very similar in general outline. Each one 
started off by claiming two townships of land for a 
university 2 and the sixteenth section for schools, and 
the state constitution committed it to equal school 
opportunities for all. But not until the close of the first 
quarter of the nineteenth century * was a system of 
1 Of course, Ohio was first settled in the southeast by that very impor- 
tant band of New Englanders led by Manasseh Cutler, but the southwest 
was decidedly Southern in the sympathies of its population, and even the 
southeast became more cosmopolitan through later immigrations.

the southwest, on the ground that it was so far removed from the Cutler 
colony.

common schools, with the organization of districts, 
appointment of school officers, and local taxation pro- 
vided by the legislature. Even then the acts were 
largely ‘permissive,’ the tax was not exacted from any- 
one who objected, and for some time various laws 
allowed public funds to be paid to existing private schools 
for the tuition of the poor. The complete system with 
a state superintendent was first organized in Ohio by 
1836, but a similar stage of development was not reached 
by the other two states until after the great period of 
common school development (1835-60) had passed over 
the country. Michigan, on the other hand, as early 
as 1817 established a ‘catholepistemiad,’ which was to 
include a university and a system of schools of all grades, | 
and a dozen years later in its revision of the school laws 
provided for a department of education at the university 
and a state superintendency of schools. While under 
this territorial law of 1829 tuition fees were to be re- 
quired, except from the poor, by the first state constitu- 
tion in 1837 the school lands were taken over from the 
wasteful management of the towns, and a public school 
was required to be open for three months in every dis- 
trict. The state superintendency was also established, 
and. before 1840 Michigan was well started with a com- 
plete system. of common schools. 
Condition of the Common Schools Prior to the Awak~ 
ening.—Thus, while some of the New England states, 
New York, and Ohio possessed the only definitely 
organized systems of public education, the movement for 
common schools had made some progress in all sections 
of the country even before the educational awakening 
spread through the land, A radical modification had

taken place in the European institutions with w. had made 
education in the United States began. To meet the cveryehere 
demands of the new environment,(education had become in elementary, 
more democratic and less religious and sectarian. Wealth and higher 
had become much greater and material interests had met “*#™~ 
with a marked growth. (fhe old aristocratic institutions 
had begun to disappear) ” Town and district schools had 
been taking the place of the old-chuzch, private, and 
‘field’ schools, and in some of the cities the foundation for 
publiceducation was being laid by quasi-public societies or 
even through local taxation. The academies had replaced 
the ‘grammar’ schools, and the colleges had lost their dis- 
tinctly ecclesiastical character. State universities were 
starting in the South and Northwest. All these evidences 
of the growth of democracy, nonsectarianism, popular 
training, and the social movement in education were 
destined to be greatly multiplied and spread before long. 
Such an awakening will be found to be characteristic 
of the great development of common schools that took 
place in the decades around the middle of the nineteenth _ 
century., But, before pursuing the subject further, we 
must direct our attention to some new reforms in method 
and content that were being introduced by Pestalozzi, 
into education in Europe and were destined to produce 
a great stimulus in the public systems of the United 
States.

OBSERVATION AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING IN EDUCATION 
Pestalozzi as the Successor of Rousseau.—Having 
outlined the various phases and influences of philan- 
thropic education and surveyed the rise of the common 
school in America, we may now turn again to the more 
immediate development of the movements that found 
their roots in Rousseau. These received their first great 
growth through Pestalozzi. In the second chapter it was 
noted how Rousseau’s ‘naturalistic’ doctrines logically 
pointed to a complete demolition of the artificial society 
and education of the times. A pause at this point would 
have led to anarchy. If civilization is not to disappear, 
social destruction must be followed by reconstruction. 
Of course the negative attitude of the Emile was itself 
accompanied by considerable positive advance in its sug- 
gestions for a natural training, but this advice was often 
unpractical and extreme and its main emphasis was upon 
the destruction of existing education. ‘Hence the hap- 
piest educational results of Rousseau’s work came through 
Pestalozzi, who especially supplemented that reformer’s 
work upon the constructive side. Rousseau had shat- 
tered the eighteenth century edifice of despotism, privi- 
lege, and hypocrisy, and it remained for Pestalozzi 
to continue the erection of the more enduring structure 
he had started to build upon the ruins. Thus Pestalozzi 
became the first prominent educator to help Rousseau

develop his negative and somewhat inconsistent ‘natu- 
talism’ into a more positive attempt to reform corrupt 
society by proper education and a new method of teach- 
ing. He therein enlarged for education the social and 
psychological tendencies begun by Rousseau. 
Pestalozzi’s Industrial School at Neuhof.—But to 
understand the significance of the experiments, writings, 
and principles of this widely beloved reformer, one must 
make a brief study of his life and surroundings. (Johann 
Heinrich Pestalozzi was born at Ziirich in 1746. After 
the death of his father, he was brought up from early 
childhood almost altogether by his mother.) Through 
her unselfishness and piety, and the example of his 
grandfather, pastor in a neighboring village, Pestalozzi 
was inspired to relieve and elevate the degraded peas- 
antry about him. He first turned to the ministry as being 
the best way to accomplish this philanthropic purpose. 
But he broke down in his trial sermon, and then took up 
the study of law, with the idea of defending the rights of 
his people. In this, too, he was destined to be balked; 
strangely enough, through the influence of Rousseau. 
In common with several other students of the University 
of Ziirich, Pestalozzi was greatly impressed by the Social 
Contract and the Emile, which had recently appeared, and 
he ruined his possibilities for a legal and political career 
through a radical criticism of the government. Then, 
in 1769, he undertook to demonstrate to the peasants 
the value of improved methods. of agriculture. : He took 
up, after a year of training, a parcel of waste land at Birr, 
which he called Newhof (‘new farm’). Within five years 
the experiment proved a lamentable failure. Meantime Pestalozzi 
was inspired 
by the exam- 
ple of his 
mother and 
grandfather 
to elevate the 
peasantry 
through the 
ministry, law, 
improved 
agriculture,

   to rear upon the basis of the Emile, and the resul 
recorded in a Father’s Journal, suggested new ideas an 
ucational principles for the regeneration of the m: 
(te began to hold that education did not consist merel; 
in books and knowledge, and that the children of the poo 
could, by proper training, be taught to earn their livin 
and at the same time develop their intelligence and mor 
nature. 
ee Hence the failure of his agricultural venture afford: 
cation at  Pestalozzi the opportunity he craved to experiment with 
on f philanthropic and industrial education. Toward the 
end of 1774 he took into his home some twenty of the 
most needy children he could find. These he fed, clothed, 
and treated as his own. He gave the boys practical 
instruction in farming and gardening on small tracts, 
and had the girls trained in domestic duties and needle- 
work. In bad weather both sexes gave their time to 
spinning and weaving cotton. They. were also trained 
in the rudiments, but were practiced in conversing and 
in memorizing the Bible before learning to read and 
write. . The scholastic instruction was given very largely 
while they were working, and, although Pestalozzi had 
not as yet learned to make any direct connection between 
the occupational and the formal elements, this first 
attempt at an industrial education made it evident that 
the two could be combined. Within a few months there 
was a striking improvement in the physique, minds, and 
morals of the children, as well as in the use of their hands. 
But Pestalozzi was so enthusiastic over the success of his 
experiment that he gredtly increased the number of 
children, and by 1780 was reduced to bankruptcy. 
The Leonard and Gertrude.—Nevertheless, his widet
-P-A-G-E-141

purpose of social reform by means of education was not 
allowed to languish altogether, for a friend shortly 
persuaded him to publish his views. The Evening Hour 
of @ Hermit,’ a collection of one hundred and eighty 
ee aphorisms, was his first production. This work embodied 
most of the educational principles he afterward made 
famous, but it could be understood by few of the people, 
and he was advised to put his thought into more popular 
' form. So in 178: he wrote his well-known story of 
a 
een aa Leonard and Gertrude. This work, with subsequent 
additions, gives an account of the degraded social con- 
ditions in the Swiss village of ‘Bonnal’ and the changes 
wrought in them by one simple peasant woman. ‘Ger- 
trude’ reforms her drunkard husband, educates her 
- children, and causes the whole community to feel her 
influence and adopt her methods. When finally a wise 
schoolmaster comes to the village, he learns from Ger- 
trude the proper conduct of the school and begs for her 
continued codperation. Then the government becomes 
interested, studies the improvements that have taken 
place, and concludes that the whole country can be re- 
formed in no better way than by imitating Bonnal. The 
Leonard and Gertrude appealed especially to the roman- 
ticism of the period, and constituted Pestalozzi’s one 
popular success in literature. 
His School at Stanz and the Observational Methods.— 
During the last decade of his life at Neuhof, Pestalozzi 
was busy warding off poverty and starvation, and found 
no time for writing or educational work. But in 1798

take charge of them, started an orphan home anu scuvv. 
in an Ursuline convent. Here he soon gained the con- 
fidence and love of the children, and produced : 
noticeable improvement in them physically, mor: 
intellectually. 
He found it impossible to obtain any assistant: 
and materials, but he felt that none of these conv 
aids could be of service in the work he desire: 
Hence he sought to instruct the children rather py ex- 
i perience and observation than by abstract 
and words. This was the real beginning of hi: 
method of teaching through ‘observation,’ which was 
destined thereafter to be more stressed than his © 
intellectual training in connection with manual 
Religion and morals, for example, were never tau 
precepts, but through instances that arose:
-P-A-G-E-143

fives of the children he showed them the value of self- 
control, charity, sympathy, and gratitude. In a simi- 
larly concrete way the pupils were instructed in number 
and language work by means of objects, and in geog- 
raphy and history by conversation rather than by books. 
While they did not learn their natural history primarily 
from nature, they were taught to corroborate what they 
had learned by their own observation. With regard to 
this whole method Pestalozzi said: 
“TI believe that the first development of thought in the child is 
very much disturbed by a wordy system of teaching, which is not 
adapted either to his faculties or the circumstances of his life. 
According to my experience, success depends upon whether what is 
taught to children commends itself to them as true through being 
closely connected with their own observation. As a general rule, 
I attached little importance to the study of words, even when 
explanations of the ideas they represented were given.” + 
In connection with his observational method” Pes- 
talozzi at this time began his attempts to reduce all 
perception to its lowest terms.? It was while at Stanz, 
for example, that he first adopted his well-known plan of 
teaching children to read by means of exercises known 
as ‘syllabaries.’ )These joined the five vowels in succes- 
sion to the different consonants,—‘ab, eb, ib, ob, ub,’ 
and so on through all the consonants. ( From the phonetic 
nature of German spelling, he was able to make the 
exercises very simple, and intended thus to furnish a 
necessary practice in basal syllables. In a similar way 
he hoped to simplify all education to such an extent that 
schools would eventually become unnecessary, and that

tion’ (A BC der Anschauung). See p. 139. He sought to

each mother would be able to teach her children and 
continue her own education at the same time. 
He aomtined Pestalozzi was, moreover, able to continue at Stanz 
manual labor. his principle of intellectual development in conjunction 
with industrial training. While not altogether successful 
in his efforts at a correlation,(Pestalozzi, more than at 
Neuhof, now “sought to combine study with manual 
labor, the school with the workshop, for, said he: 
“T am more than ever convinced that as soon as we have educa- 
tional establishments combined with workshops, and conducted on 
a truly psychological basis, a generation will necessarily be formed 
which will show us by experience that our present studies do not 
require one-tenth of the time or trouble we now give to them.” 
Being forced § The ‘ Institute’ at Burgdorf and the ‘ Psychologizing 
at tear’ he Of Education’—From these experiments and concrete 
eee ae methods that Pestalozzi started at Stanz eventually 
position at developed all his educational contributions. But before 
Burgdorf. the close of a year the convent was required by the 
French soldiers for a hospital. As soon as he recovered 
from the terrific physical strain under which he had 
labored, Pestalozzi was forced to seek another place in 
which to continue his educational work. But, while he 
had a most unusual sympathetic insight into the minds 
of children and had been developing educational practice 
in two important directions, he had, according to the 
orthodox standards for securing a position to teach, 
“everything against him; thick, indistinct speech, bad 
writing, ignorance of drawing, scorn of grammatical 
learning.” He would probably have been unable to 
obtain a school, had it not been for certain influential 
friends in the town of Burgdorf. They secured a Position

for him, first in the school for the tenants and poorer 
people, and later in the elementary school of the citizens. 
In Burgdorf, Pestalozzi was obliged, on account of the 
social position of many of his pupils, to suspend his 
experiment of combining industrial with intellectual 
training. Thus to a large extent his direct contributions 
to the present day social movement in education ceased, 
although, as will later be seen, his special efforts in this 
direction were greatly enlarged and perpetuated by 
Fellenberg. He continued, however, the other great 
feature of his work, his experiments with the ‘observa- 
tional’ method, and thus helped develop the modern 
psychological movement in education. He “followed 
without any plan the empirical method interrupted at 
Stanz,” and “sought by every means to bring the el- 
ements of reading and arithmetic to the greatest sim- 
plicity, and by grouping them psychologically, enable 
the child to pass easily and surely from the first step to 
the second, and from the second to the third, and so on.” 2 (He further worked out and graduated his ‘sylla- 
baries,’ and invented the idea of large movable letters 
for teaching the children to read.\ Language exercises 
were given his pupils by means of examining the number, 
form, position, and color of the designs, holes, and rents 
in the wall paper of the school, and expressing their 
observations in longer and longer sentences, which they 
repeated after him. \For arithmetic he devised boards 
divided into squares upon which were placed dots or 
lines concretely representing each unit up to one hundred. 
By means of this ‘table of units’ ? the pupil obtained a

clear idea of the meaning of the digits and the process 
of addition, and practiced his knowledge further by 
counting his fingers, beans, pebbles, and other objects. 
Pestalozzi further explained that “after the child has 
come to a full understanding of the combination of units 
up to ten, and has learned to express himself with ease, 
the objects are again presented, but the questions are 
changed: ‘If we have two objects, how many times one 
‘object?’ The child looks, counts, and answers correctly.” 
In that way the pupils learned to multiply, and the 
meaning of division and subtraction was similarly ac- 
quired. The children were also taught the elements of 
geometry by drawing angles, lines, and curves. 
Likewise, the development of teaching history, geog- 
. raphy, and natural history by this method of observation 
and thus 
evolved his 
‘A BC of 
observation,’ 
and his stated 
wish to ‘psy- 
chologize edu- 
cation.’ must have been continued at Burgdorf. As a result of 
these experiments, says Pestalozzi, “there unfolded itself 
gradually in my mind the idea of the possibility of an 
‘A B C of observation’ to which I now attach great im- 
portance, and with the working out of which the whole 
scheme of a general method of instruction in all its scope 
appeared, though still obscure, before my eyes.”” And the 
underlying principle of his system he shortly formulated 
most tersely in the statement, “I wish to psychologize 
instruction.” ! By this, he showed, is meant the har- 
monizing of instruction with the laws of intellectual 
development, together with the simplification of the 
system was probably not completed until Pestalozzi settled at Yverdon, 
and much of the credit for the scheme should go to Kriisi and Schmid.

was made by him when asked for a written statement of his system by

elements of knowledge and their reduction to a series of 
exercises so scientifically graded that even the lowest 
classes can obtain the proper physical, mental, and moral 
development. And sense perception or observation, he 
holds, when connected with language for expressing the 
different impressions, is, therefore, the foundation of 
education. | 
Despite a want of system and errors in carrying out 
his method, Pestalozzi seems to have produced remark- 
able results from the start. At the first annual examina- 
tion the Burgdorf School Commission wrote him that 
“the surprising progress of your little scholars of various 
capacities shows plainly that every one is good for 
something, if the teacher knows how to get at his 
abilities and develop them according to the laws of 
psychology.” And the reformer soon met with even 
greater success in a school of his own. In January, 1801, 
the government granted him the free use of the ‘castle,’ 
or town hall, of Burgdorf and a small subsidy for his 
‘institute.’ Pupils poured in; a number of progressive 
teachers, including Kriisi, Tobler, Buss, and Niederer,’ 
came to assist him; many persons of prominence visited 
the school and made most favorable reports upon its 
methods; and during the following three years and a half 
the Pestalozzian views on education were systematically 
developed and applied. 
1 Hermann Krisi, a young schoolmaster of Gais, had, during a famine 
in Appenzell, brought a troop of starving children to Burgdorf at the 
invitation of Fischer, a friend of Pestalozzi. Fischer died shortly after- 
ward, and Kriisi joined Pestalozzi’s venture. Through Kriisi, the ser- 
vices of Tobler, “‘a private tutor whose youth had been much neglected,” 
and of Buss, “a bookbinder, who devoted his leisure to singing and 
drawing,” were also secured for the institute. Niederer was a clergy- Pestalozzi’s

Hl How Gertrude 
| Teaches Her 
Children. 130 A HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
How Gertrude Teaches Her Children.—Pestalozzi was 
also able at Burgdorf to undertake a detailed statement 
of his method by the publication in October, 1801, 
of his How Gertrude Teaches Her Children. This work 
does not mention Gertrude, but consists of fifteen letters 
to his friend, Gessner. The first three letters contain 
biographical details, especially concerning the meeting 
with his assistant teachers. Then follows an account of 
his general principles; of the specific teaching of language, 
drawing, writing, measuring, and number by means of 
observation; of the elementary books that he contem- 
plates writing.—the A B C of Observation and the Book 
for Mothers; * of the reform in elementary education and 
of the need of judgment as well as knowledge; and of 
moral and religious development. Like all of Pestalozzi’s 
works, How Gertrude Teaches Her Children is quite lacking 
in both plan and proportion, and is filled with repetitions 
and digressions. It contains, however, the foundation of 
his system and of most modern reform in elementary edu- 
cation, and has to be studied to reveal its values. It has 
already been quoted several times directly, but the fol- 
lowing summary of its principles, made by Pestalozzi’s 
biographer, Morf, after a most.careful study of this unsys-, 
tematic work, may serve to give an idea of Pestalozzi’s 
educational creed. He had vaguely come to believe: 
man and philosopher, who gave up his parochial duties to work with 
Pestalozzi. 
1The Book for Mothers was later written under Pestalozzi’s direction 
by Krisi. It completely failed in its purpose, however, since the average 
mother was unable to break from the ideals and habits of her own school- 
days. The A B C of Observation also appeared, and during this period 
Pestalozzi and his assistants likewise produced a variety of books apply- 
ing the new method to various school subjects.

The ‘ Institute’ at Yverdon and the Culmination of 
the Pestalozzian Methods.—While this productive work 
at Burgdorf was at its height, a change in the political 
situation overthrew everything. In 1804 the cantonal 
government demanded back the ‘castle,’ although it 
turned over to Pestalozzi an old convent at Miinchen- 
buchsee. For a few months the reformer made a fruitless 
attempt to codperate in his new location with Fellenberg, 
whose industrial school in the neighboring Hofwy1 will be 
discussed later in this chapter.! When, however, despite

their similarity of purpose, a marked difference of tem- 
peraments made a union of the work of Pestalozzi and 
Fellenberg impossible, the former transferred his school 
to Yverdon in 1805, and was soon followed by most of 
his assistants. The ‘institute’ here sprang into fame 
almost immediately, and increased in numbers and 
prosperity for several years. Children were sent to 
Yverdon from great distances, and teachers thronged 
there to learn and apply the new principles at home. 
Visitors and sightseers, including kings, nobles, generals, 
statesmen, and educators came from all parts of Europe 
and America. Pestalozzi was decorated by the czar 
of Russia, and presented with distinctions from half a 
dozen other monarchs. <A flourishing girls’ school grew 
up near the institute under the direction of associates, 
and for a short time Pestalozzi himself conducted a 
school for orphans in the neighborhood, while Conrad 
Naef of Ziirich came to Vverdon and founded a celebrated ~ 
institution for the deaf and dumb upon the Pestalozzian 
principles. 
The work of the institute at Yverdon was 2 continua- 
tion and culmination of the observational methods 
started at Stanz and Burgdorf. It was a great center 
of educational experimentation, and nearly every ad- 
vanced practice characteristic of present elementary 
education was first undertaken there. His general 
method of teaching all subjects was through observation 
connected with language. The children were taught to 
observe correctly and form the right idea of the relations 
of things, and so to have no difficulty in expressing clearly 
what they thoroughly understood. The simplification, 
introduced through the ‘syllabaries’ and ‘table of units’
-P-A-G-E-151
OBSERVATION IN EDUCATION 133 
was further elaborated. A ‘table of fractions’ was also 
devised for teaching that subject concretely. It con- 
sisted of a series of squares, which could be divided in- 
definitely and in different ways. Some of the squares 
were whole, while others were divided horizontally into 
two, three, or even ten equal parts. The pupil thus 
learned by observation to count’ the parts of units and 
form them into integers. There was further developed 
a ‘table of fractions of fractions,’ or compound fractions,! 
in which the squares were divided, not only horizontally, 
but vertically, so that the method of reducing two frac- 
tions to the same denominator might be self-evident. 
It was in this number work that the Pestalozzians were 
most radical. By means of various devices Kriisi, and 
afterward Schmid ? even more, attained great clearness, 
accuracy, and rapidity in arithmetic. The work was 
often done aloud without paper, and many of the stu- 
dents became most apt in calculation. 
Similarly, in order to draw and write, the pupil was first 
taught the simple elements of form. The consecutive ex- 
ercises for building up form from its elements, however, 
Pestalozzi was not happy in determining, but Buss suc- 
cessfully worked out an ‘alphabet of form.’ Objects, such 
as sticks or pencils, were placed in different directions, 
and lines representing them were drawn on the board 
or slate until all elementary forms, straight or curved, 
were mastered. The pupils combined these elements,

2 Joseph Schmid was a Tyrolese shepherd boy, who had come to 
Yverdon as a pupil, but because of his brilliancy was soon promoted to 
be an assistant master. His Exercises on Numbers and Forms was one of 
the best known books based upon the Pestalozzian methods. he taught

instead of copying models, and were encouraged to de 
sign symmetrical and graceful figures. This also paved 
the way for writing, for, said Pestalozzi, ‘in endeavoring 
to teach writing, I found I must begin by teaching 
drawing.” The children wrote on their slates, beginning 
with the easiest letters and gradually forming words 
from them, but soon learned to write on paper with a 
pen. Writing was, however, taught in connection with 
reading, although begun somewhat later than that study. 
Constructive geometry was also learned through drawing. 
Much use was made of squares, which were divided into 
smaller squares or rectangles, and thus sense impression 
preparatory to geometry was furnished. The pupils 
were taught to distinguish, first vertical, horizontal, 
oblique, and parallel lines; then they learned right, 
acute, and obtuse angles, different kinds of triangles, 
quadrilaterals, and other figures; and finally discovered 
at. how many points a certain number of straight lines 
may be made to cut one another, and how many angles, 
triangles, and quadrilaterals can be formed. To make 
the matter concrete, the figures were often cut out of 
cardboard or made into models. Thus the pupils were 
led up to theoretical geometry, which was made more 
valuable and interesting by their working out the dem- 
onstrations for themselves, instead of learning them 
from a book. 
In nature study, geography, and history the concrete 
observational work was similarly continued. Trees, 
flowers, and birds were viewed, drawn, and discussed. 
The pupils began in geography by acquiring the points 
of the compass and relative positions, and from this 
knowledge observed and described some familiar place.

The valley of the Buron near at hand was observed in 
detail and modeled upon long tables in clay brought 
from its sides. Then the pupils were shown the map for 
the first time and easily grasped the meaning of its 
symbols. Pestalozzi inspired the scientist, Karl Ritter, 
with a great love for geography and a desire to work it 
out psychologically. Ritter had already been trained 
in principles similar to Pestalozzi’s in Salzmann’s school 
at Schnepfenthal,! but his method in geography seems to 
have been influenced mostly by Pestalozzi. Like the 
Swiss reformer, he held to the necessity of providing 
children with first-hand experiences by beginning with 
home geography. Hence, instead of the ‘arbitrary and 
unmethodical collection of all facts ascertained to exist 
throughout the earth,’ which constituted the old ‘ency- 
clopedic’ type of geography, Ritter presented a work 
based on principles indicated by the title,—The Science 
of the Earth in Relation to Nature and the History of Man; 
or General Comparative Geography as the Foundation of the 
Study of and Instruction in the Physical and Historical 
Sciences. The principles underlying this elaborate work, 
of which some nineteen volumes were published by the 
time of his death, virtually made the science of geog- - 
raphy. Nor was Pestalozzi sufficiently acquainted with music from 
music to apply his method to it. This was, however, done ee de lest 
by his friend, Nageli, a Swiss composer of note, who re- aad tiligion 
duced it to its simplest tone elements and then combined and morality 
and developed these progressively into more complex and from oeumis 
connected wholes. Pupils were thus led to discover. ples. /

talozzi sought by concrete examples to quicken the germ 
of conscience into action and develop it by successive 
steps. The love of God he believed could be taught 
better through the child’s love for his mother 1 and other 
human beings than through dogma and catechism, and 
the significance of obedience, duty, and unselfishness 
through being required to wait before having his desires 
fulfilled, and so realizing that his own is not the only 
will or pleasure in the world. 
But for va. With all these achievements, however, the institute 
the institute at Yverdon was slowly dying. Pestalozzi was never a 
toke ae" practical administrator, and he was now an old man. 
after twenty The death of his wife deprived him of most-of the mental 
Pestalozai balance that remained to him. He came to depend 
oe Ke, almost entirely upon his assistant, Schmid, who was most 
despotic and drove several of the best teachers from the 
institute. Disputes and lawsuits became common, and 
the finances of the institution went from bad to worse. 
The constant interruptions of visitors also demoralized 
the school. Finally, in 1825, after an existence of a 
score of years and with a reputation throughout the 
civilized world, the institute was closed. Pestalozzi 
retired to Neuhof, then in possession of his grandson. 
Two years later he died and was buried near his old home 
Pestalozat beside the school of the little village. 
makesexplict  Pestalozzi’s Educational Aim.—After this account of 
Rousseau's | ‘Pestalozzi’s personality, experiments, and writings, we 
by defining are ready to discuss his aim in ris aim in education and to under- 
education 85 stand the principles underlying his me | of ‘observa- the natural 
development tion’ and in what sense they were a continuation of 1] 
pacities, Rousseau’s s ‘naturalism.’ In his first writing, The 
1 See How Gertrude Teaches Her Claldren, XIV and XV.  
-P-A-G-E-155
OBSERVATION IN EDUCATION 137 
Evening Hour of a Hermit, he held that “all the beneficent 
powers of man are due to neither art nor chance, but to 
nature,” and that education should follow “the course 
laid down by nature.” So in all his works he constantly 
returns to the analogy of the child’s development with 
that of the natural growth of the plant. For example, 
he writes: 
“Sound education stands before me symbolized by a tree planted 
near fertilizing waters. A little seed, which contains the design 
of the tree, its form and proportions, is placed in the soil. See 
how it germinates and expands into trunk, branches, leaves, 
flowers, and,fruit. The whole tree is an uninterrupted chain of 
organic parts, the plan of which existed in its seed and root. Man 
is similar to the tree. In the new-born child are hidden those 
faculties which are to unfold during life. The individual and 
separate organs of his being form themselves gradually into 
unison, and build up humanity in the image of God.” 
Consequently, Pestalozzi defines education as “the 
natural, progressive, and harmonious development of 
all the powers and capacities of the human being,” and 
insists that “the knowledge to which the child is to 
be led by instruction must, therefore, be subjected to a 
certain order of succession, the beginning of which must 
be adapted to the first unfolding of his powers, and the 
progress kept exactly parallel to that of his development.” 
This belief in the observance of development from within 
is in-keeping with Rousseau’s naturalism, and was after- 
ward enlarged upon by Froebel in his stressing of the 
innate. In contrast to such an education in harmony 
with nature, Pestalozzi saw that the traditional practices 
of the times gave the pupil a mere ability to read words, 
a memory knowledge of mathematics, and a superficial and contrast- 
ing this with 
the formal 
education of 
the day.
-P-A-G-E-156
He further 
extended 138 A HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
culture through the classics that was purely form: 
and ineffective for real development. He declares: 
         
  “Our unpsychological schools are essentially only artificial 
stifling machines for destroying all the results of the power an 
experience that nature herself brings to life.... After th 
children have enjoyed the happiness of sensuous life for five whol 
years, we make all nature around them vanish before their eyes; 
tyrannically stop the delightful course of their unrestrained free- 
dom; pen them up like sheep, whole flocks huddled together in| 
stinking rooms; pitilessly chain them for hours, days, weeks, 
months, years, to the contemplation of unnatural and unattrac- 
tive letters, and, (contrasted with their former condition), to a 
maddening course of life.” 
This need for allowing the powers of the child to de- 
velop gradually in keeping with nature and the complete 
absence of anything of the sort in the schools of the 
period had been pointed out by Rousseau, but largely 
in a negative way. He talked blindly in his ‘natural- 
ism’ about an abandonment of all society and civiliza- 
tion and a return to nature, but he failed to make 
his educational doctrine concrete and explicit and to 
apply it to the school. Pestalozzi further modified and 
-xtended the Rousselian doctrine by recommending its 
pplication to all children, whatever their circumstances 
nd abilities. Where Rousseau evidently had only the 
young aristocrat in mind in the education of Emile, 
Pestalozzi held that poverty could be relieved and 
society reformed only through ridding each and every 
one of his degradation by means of mental and moral 
development. Accordingly, he was the stanch advocate 
of universal education, as shown by the protest implied 
in the following simile:
-P-A-G-E-157
SO ee OBSERVATION IN EDUCATION 139 
“ As far as I am acquainted with popular instruction, it appears 
to me like a large house, whose uppermost story shines in splendor 
of highly finished art, but is occupied by only a few. In the middle 
story is a great crowd, but the stairs by which the upper one may 
be reached in an approved and respectable manner are wanting; if 
the attempt be made in a less regular way, the leg or arm used as a 
means of progress may be broken. In the lowest story is an im- 
mense throng of people, who have precisely the same right to enjoy 
the light of the sun as those in the upper one; but they are left in 
utter darkness and not even allowed to gaze at the magnificence 
above.” 
His General Method and Its Applications.—Pes- 
talozzi’s general method of giving free play to this 
natural development of the powers of all and so for re- 
forming social conditions was to train his pupils through 
‘observation.’ He felt that clear ideas could be formed 
only by means of careful sense perceptions, and he was 
thoroughly opposed to the mechanical memorizing with 
little understanding that was current in the schools of the 
day. In all studies, therefore, he strove to direct the 
senses of the pupils to outer objects and to arouse their 
consciousness by the impressions thus produced. While 
such ‘object lessons’ did not exist in the traditionalized 
schools, Pestalozzi insisted that the material for them is 
all about the children, and that it can best be obtained 
in the home and school and in the ordinary occupations, 
surroundings, and experiences of life. His method in 
general seems to have been to analyze each subject into 
its simplest elements, or ‘A B C,’ and to develop it by 
gtaded exercises based as far as possible upon the study 
of objects rather than words. Yet Pestalozzi felt that 
“experiences must be clearly expressed in words, or 
aa e. Anschauung. His general 
method was 
training in 
‘observation’ 
through the 
surrounding 
material, 
analysis into 
its simplest 
elements, and

otherwise there arises the same danger t

with ‘observation.’ 
The application of this method of nature 
by means of analysis, observation, and ve 
to the various studies constituted the mo. 
work of Pestalozzi. , The special applicatic 
eral method that were worked out by him a1 
in the most common subjects of the curricuuwu uave vou 
described in detail in the account of his work at St: 
Burgdorf, and Yverdon. Language was taught, noi: 
abstract rules, but by conversation concerning object, 
speaking was held to precede grammar, reading, spelling, 
and composition. The language training began with sin- 
gle elements or sounds, learned through the ‘syllabaries’; 
from these words were built up; and from words, sen- 
tences. As sounds were the elements in language, num- 
bers were the basis of arithmetic. Here again observation 
was used, and numbers and their relations were taught 
the pupil through objects. For this purpose the various 
tables of units, fractions, and compound fractions were 
devised. Similarly, from the rudiments of form were 
taught drawing, writing, and constructive geometry. 
For the study of geography, nature, and history, ele- 
ments were found in the locality that could be combined 
until the whole world and all the relations of man were 
worked out. Music was reduced to its simplest elements 
and progressively developed, and moral and religious

training was given through the ordinary concrete rela- 
tions and experiences of life. 
The Permanent Influence of Pestalozzi—It is easy 
to exaggerate the achievements of this almost sainted 
reformer of Switzerland. Pestalozzi’s methods were 
neither very original nor well carried out. His chief 
merit lay in developing and making positive the sugges- 
tions offered by Rousseau, and in utilizing them in the 
work of the schools. Even in this he failed somewhat in 
practicality and consistency. He was often unable to 
work out his own methods. While he stated his views 
in general most convincingly, we have seen that many 
of the details had to be managed by his assistants and 
followers. Occasionally, when he undertook to apply the 
methods himself, he was strangely inconsistent. Although 
strongly opposed to all verbal and memoriter teaching, 
in language work he made the mistake of shaping the 
sentences for his pupils and having them repeat after 
him; he insisted upon teaching reading and spelling by 
pronouncing every possible variety of syllable; and in 
geography, history, and nature study he required the 
pupils to commit mere lists of important places, facts, 
' or objects arranged in alphabetic order. Moreover, 
as can be seen both in his educational experiments and 
his writings, Pestalozzi was groping and never possessed 
full vision. He did not grasp definite educational prin- 
ciples in a scientific way, but, like Rousseau, obtained 
his ideas of teaching from sympathetic insight into the 
minds of children. His writings for the most part record 
his empirical efforts at an effective training, and are 
revelations of methods of teaching in the concrete rather 
than the abstract- His works are also poorly arranged; Pestalozzi 
lacked in 
originality, 
practicality, 
and consist- 
ency, and was 
often _repeti- 
tious, inac- 
curate, and 
lacking in 
compreben- 
siveness,

the people by intellectual, moral, and industrial training, 
and he burned to apply it universally and to develop 
methods in keeping with nature. He would make Rous- 
seau’s ‘ naturalism’ specific and extend it to all. In this 
he may be considered one of the greatest exponents of the 
social movement in modern education. His efforts to 
evolve a natural method of teaching were likewise fruit- 
ful, and mark the greatest stimulus given to the modern 
psychological movement in education. His experiments 
have stimulated educational theorists, instead of accept- 
ing formal principles and traditional processes, to work out 
carefully and patiently the development of the child mind 
and to embody the results in practice. From him have 
come the prevailing reforms in the present teaching of 
language lessons, arithmetic, drawing, writing, reading, 
geography, elementary science, and music. In harmony 
with his improved methods, Pestalozzi also started a dif- 
ferent type of discipline. His work made clear the new 
spirit in the school by which it has approached the atmos- 
phere of the home. He found the proper relation of pupil 
and teacher to exist in sympathy and friendship, or, as he From him

contrast to that of the brutal schools of the times, and 
introduced a new conception into education. 
What, then, if Pestalozzi is right in saying: “‘My life 
has produced nothing whole, nothing complete; my work 
cannot, then, either be a whole, nor complete”? If he 
never produced a closed and perfected system, so much.- ~ 
the better. It is not merely the form of his experiments 
nor even the results, but the fact that he was ready to ex- 
periment, and did not depend upon tradition, that made “# His system

In fact, whenever his practice was most fixed, it was least 
effective; and wherever his spirit has since prevailed, 
the most intelligent practice has resulted. The nineteenth 
century was suffused with his ideals, and his methods 
have become the basis of much subsequent reform. His 
work has constantly grown more significant as the years 
have passed, and the indebtedness of modern educational 
method to him will be more evident when we have seen 
the part he played in developing the practice of Herbart 
and Froebel. 
‘The Spread of Pestalozzian Schools and Methods 
through Europe.—The ‘observational’ methods of Pesta- 
lozai and institutions similar to his were soon spread by 
his assistants and others throughout Europe. Strange 
to say, as a result of their familiarity with his weaknesses 
and the conservatism resulting from isolation, the Swiss 
were, as a whole, rather slow to incorporate the Pesta- 
lozzian improvements. Ziirich was, however, an excep- 
tion to the general rule. This city was naturally more 
progressive and had previously been a seat of reform 
in matters religious.1 Here Zeller of Wiirtemberg, who 
had visited Burgdorf and helped conduct a Pestalozzian 
training school at Hofwyl,? was early invited to give 
three courses of lectures in aid of the establishment 
of a teachers’ seminary based upon the principles of 
Pestalozzi. A large number of teachers, clergymen, and 
persons of prominence heard these lectures, and thus in- 
creased the body of those disseminating the new educa- 
tional reforms. Kriisi, after leaving the institute at

Yverdon, also founded a number of schools and carried 
Pestalozzianism into various parts of Switzerland. He 
finally, in 1833, became the director of a teachers’ sem- 
inary at his native village of Gais. Near this institution 
he founded two Pestalozzian schools under the manage- 
ment of his daughter, and during the last decade of his 
life contributed largely to the Pestalozzian literature. 
Many other disciples eventually started or reorganized 
schools in various parts of Switzerland upon the prin- 
ciples of Pestalozzi, and, before the middle of the nine- 
teenth century, his ‘observation’ methods were in gen- 
eral use, and educational conditions had been greatly 
changed in Switzerland. 
But the reforms in method never secured the hold upon 
the country of their origin that they did in Germany. 
The innovations were most remarkable in Prussia, and 
the elementary education there has come to be referred 
to as the ‘Prussian-Pestalozzian school system.’ The 
name was first used by the great educational leader, 
Diesterweg, in his address at. the centennial celebration 
of Pestalozzi’s birth, but it so aptly indicates the influ- 
ence of the Swiss reformer that it has remained ever since. 
By the beginning of the nineteenth century Pestalozzian- 
ism began to find its way into Prussia. In 1801 the 
appeal of Pestalozzi for a public subscription in be- 
half of his project at Burgdorf was warmly supported. 
In 1802 Herbart’s account of Pestalozzi’s Idea of an 
A BC of Observation attracted much attention. A rep- 
resentative was sent from Prussia to Burgdorf to report 
upon the new system in 1803. Meanwhile the Pesta- 
lozzian missionaries were fast converting the land. 
Plamann, who had visited Burgdorf, in 1805 established Prussia
-P-A-G-E-164
146 A HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
a Pestalozzian school in Berlin,! and published several 
books applying the new methods to language, geography, 
and natural history. The same year Griner opened a 
similar school at Frankfurt, which was later the means 
of starting Froebel upon an educational career. Zeller 
was coaxed away from Wiirtemberg, and in the seminary 
at Konigsberg lectured to large audiences, and organized 
a Pestalozzian orphanage there. A similar institution for 
educating orphans was opened at Potsdam by Tiirck. In 
1808, two of Pestalozzi’s pupils, Nicolovius and Stivern, 
were made directors of public instruction in Prussia, and 
sent seventeen brilliant young men to Yverdon.to study 
for three years. Upon their return these vigorous youth- 
ful educators zealously advanced the cause. The greatest 
impulse, however, was given the movement by the phi- 
losopher, Fichte. In the course of his Addresses to the Ger- 
man Nation, 1807-1808, he described the work of Pesta- 
lozzi and declared: 
“To the course of instruction which has been invented and 
brought forward by Heinrich Pestalozzi, and which is now being 
successfully carried out under his direction, must we look for 
our regeneration.” 2 
In this position Fichte was ardently supported by 
King Frederick William III, and even more by his noble 
queen, Louise, who now felt that only through these ad- 
vanced educational principles could a restoration of the 
territory and prestige lost to Napoleon at Jena be ef- 
fected. Throughout his reign the king took the keenest

-P-A-G-E-165
OBSERVATION IN EDUCATION 147 
interest in the Pestalozzian schools, and the queen fre- 
quently went to visit the institutions of Zeller. A similar 
spirit was animating the other states of Germany. As 
early as 1803, Bavaria sent an educator named Miiller to 
Burgdorf to study the methods, and upon his return he 
started a school at Mainz. Saxony authorized Bloch- 
mann, a former pupil of Pestalozzi, to reorganize its 
schools upon the new basis. Through Denzel, Wiirtem- 
berg introduced the new methods, and during the first 
decade of the century many Pestalozzians were appointed 
seminary directors and school inspectors. Denzel also 
organized the school system for the duchy of Nassau. 
The Princess Pauline of Detmold and other rulers were 
likewise eager to improve the education of their realms 
by the introduction of the new principles. Everywhere 
in Germany the greatest enthusiasm prevailed among 
teachers, state’ officials, and princes. Thus in place of 
the reading, singing, and memorizing of texts, songs, and 
catechism, under the direction of incompetent choris- 
ters and sextons, with unsanitary buildings and brutal 
punishment, all Germany has come to have in each vil- 
lage an institution for training real men and women. 
Each school is under the guidance of a devoted, humane, 
and seminary-bred teacher, and the methods in religion, 
reading, arithmetic, history, geography, and elementary 
science are vitalized and interesting. As a result, the 
German schools have for the past three or four genera- 
tions been considered models, and have been visited by 
educators and distinguished men from every land. 
In France the spread of Pestalozzianism was at first 
prevented by the military spirit of the time and by the 
apathy in education, and later, when the reaction oc- and other 
states of Ger- 
many,
-P-A-G-E-166

Russia, 148 A HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
curred, the schools came under ecclesiastical control and 
had little influence upon the people. Nevertheless, there 
were evidences of interest in the new doctrines. General 
Jullien came to Yverdon to study the methods, and 
issued two commendatory reports, which induced some 
thirty French pupils to go to Pestalozzi’s institute. 
Chavannes also published a treatise upon the Pestaloz- 
zian methods in 1805. Three years later the philosopher, 
de Biran, founded a Pestalozzian school under the man- 
agement of a certain Barraud, whom he had sent to 
study under Pestalozzi. These efforts, however, had 
little effect upon education, and the Pestalozzian prin- 
ciples did not make much headway in France up to the 
revolution of 1830. After that time they rapidly be- 
came popular, especially through Victor Cousin. This 
famous professor, who was later minister of public in- 
struction, issued in 1835 a Report on the State of Public 
Instruction in Prussia, which showed the great merit of 
Pestalozzianism in the elementary schools of that coun- 
try. The other great minister, Guizot, had likewise rec- 
ommended the Prussian schools as the best type for the 
reform movement, and had shown himself most zealous 
in training teachers for their vocation after the ideals of 
Pestalozzi. Spain at first took kindly to the new methods. 
A few schools were founded on these principles, and a 
number of pupils sent to Pestalozzi through the govern- 
ment, but a reaction soon occurred and education was 
turned over to the ecclesiastical authorities. In Russia 
the czar showed himself interested in Pestalozzi’s work, 
a school similar to the ‘institutes’ was founded, and a 
former assistant of Pestalozzi became tutor to the royal 
princes, but probably nothing permanent was accom-
-P-A-G-E-167

plished. Schools were also established before long in 
Italy, Denmark, and Holland by Pestalozzians, but 
none of them met with much success, and continental 
Europe in general adopted the new principles indirectly 
from Germany. 
In England the influence of Pestalozzi was large, but and England 
the use made of his methods was not altogether happy. 
The private school opened by Mayo after his return from 
Yverdon employed object teaching in several subjects, 
and a popular textbook, entitled Lessons on Objects, was 
written by his sister, Elizabeth! This book of Miss 
Mayo’s consisted of encyclopedic lessons on the arts and 
sciences arranged in definite series, and much beyond the 
comprehension of children from six to eight years old, 
for whom it was intended. Together with several texts 
of a similar sort, it had a wide influence in formalizing 
object teaching and spreading it rapidly in this form. 
As we have seen, the Mayos were also interested in in- 
fant schools, and when ‘The Home and Colonial School 
Society’ was organized in 1836, they combined the Pesta- 
lozzian methods with those of the infant school. Thus 
through the model and training schools of this society 
formalized Pestalozzianism was extended through Eng- 
land and America.

little connected at any time. The earliest presentation 
was that made from the treatise of Chavannes in 1805 by 
William McClure. This gentleman was a retired Scotch- 
American merchant and a man of science, who had, 
upon the invitation of Napoleon, gone to visit the or- 
phanage at Paris directed by Joseph Neef, a former 
teacher at Burgdorf. Mr. McClure afterward spent 
much time at the institute in Yverdon, and by his writ- 
ings, articles, and financial support did much to make the 
new principles known in the United States. In 1806 he 
induced Neef to come to America and become his ““mas- 
ter’s apostle in the new world”. Neef maintained an 
institution at Philadelphia for three years and afterward 
founded and taught schools in Louisville, Kentucky, 
and other parts of the country. In 1823 he went with 
McClure and Owen to New Harmony, Indiana, where an 
attempt was made to unite Pestalozzianism with the | 
principles of the ‘infant school’.1 But his imperfect ac- 
quaintance with English and with American character 
and his frequent migrations prevented his personal in-

works that he published upon applications of the Pes- 
talozzian methods were given scant attention.” 
A large variety of literature, describing the new edu- 
cation, and translating the accounts of Chavannes, Jul- 
lien, Cousin, and a number of the German educational- 
ists, also appeared in the American educational journals 
from 1820 to 1860. The American Journal of Education,

OBSERVATION IN EDUCATION I5t 
The American Annals of Education, edited by William C. 
Woodbridge, 1831-1839, were especially active in giving 
«descriptions and personal observations of the Pestaloz- 
zian schools in Europe. Both in articles for his American 
Journal of Education (1855-1881) ' and in his practical 
| work, Henry Barnard lauded the Pestalozzian methods. 
Returned travelers, like Professor John Griscom, pub- 
lished accounts of their visits and experiences at Yverdon 
and Burgdorf, and such lecturers as the Reverend Charles 
Brooks began to suggest the new principles as a remedy 
for our educational deficiencies. Pestalozzi’s objective 
methods and the oral instruction resulting from them 
were used in various subjects by a number of educators. 
For example, the methods advocated in arithmetic were 
introduced into America by Warren Colburn. He spread 
‘mental arithmetic’ throughout the country, and in his 
famous First Lessons in Arithmetic on the Plan of Pes- 
talozzi, published first in 1821, he even printed the ‘table 
of units.’ The formalized ‘Grube method’ of arithmetic, 
which is for the most part based upon Pestalozzi’s prin- 
ciple of reducing every sense perception to its elements, 
also became very popular in the United States about 
1870, and remained a fetish for almost a generation. 
| The Pestalozzi-Ritter method in geography was early 
presented in the United States through the institute lec- 
tures and textbooks of Arnold Guyot, who had been a 
’ pupil of Ritter and came to America from Switzerland 
in 1848. The promotion of geographic method along 
the same lines was later more successfully performed by 
' Francis Wayland Parker in his tr4ining of teachers and 
his work on How to Teach Geography. Colonel Parker

has also had several successful pupils, who are to-day 
largely continuing the Pestalozzian tradition. The Pes- 
talozzian method in music was brought into the Boston 
schools and elsewhere about 1836 by Lowell Mason, 
who was influenced by the works of Nageli. In several 
of the subjects taught in their school, Brapson Alcott 
and his brother urged and practiced the methods of Pes- 
talozzi, and David P. Page, as principal of the New York 
State Normal School, utilized the spirit and many of the 
methods of the Swiss reformer. 
The aot in- The most influential propaganda of the Pestalozzian 
movements, doctrines in general, however, came through the account 
Hanae of the German school methods in the Seventh Annual 
by Horace Report (1843) of Horace Mann,* and through the inaugu- 
Mann’ oe ration of the ‘Oswego methods’ by Dr. Edward A. 
Report Sheldon. Mann spoke most enthusiastically of the suc- 
cess of the Prussian-Pestalozzian system of education and 
hinted at the need of a radical reform along the same lines 
in America. The report caused a great sensation, and 
was bitterly combated by a group of thirty-one Boston 
schoolmasters and by conservative sentiment through- 
out the country. Nevertheless, the suggested reforms 
were largely effected, and were carried much further by 
the successors of Mann in the secretaryship of the Mas- 
and by Shel sachusetts State Board of Education.? Dr. Sheldon, on 
methods’ the other hand, caught his Pestalozzian inspiration from 
Toronto, Canada, where he became acquainted with the 
formalized methods of the Mayos through publications 
of the Home and Colonial School Society.2 He resolved 
to introduce the principles of Pestalozzi into the Oswego, 
schools, of which he was at that time superintendent, and

| INDUSTRIAL TRAINING IN EDUCATION 153 
in 1861 secured from the society in London a Miss 
M. E. M. Jones, an experienced Pestalozzian, to train his 
teachers in these methods. There was some criticism 
of the Oswego methods on the ground of formalism, but 
after a year and a half of the experiment, a committee of 
distinguished educators, who had been invited to inspect 
the work, pronounced the Oswego movement in general 
a success. Superintendent Sheldon had from the first 
admitted a few teachers from outside to learn the new 
methods, and in 1865 the Qswego training school was 
made a state institution. This | was_ the. first..normal.. 
sclB6I"in the United States where object lessons. were the 
chief” ‘feature, and where classes were conducted by 
model el teachers and practice teaching was afforded under 
the superyision of critic teachers. The excellent teachers 
graduated from this institution caused the Oswego 
methods to be widely known throughout the country. 
A large number of other normal schools upon the same 
basis sprang up rapidly in many states, and the Oswego 
methods crept into the training schools and the publicsys- 
tems of numerous cities. As a consequence, during the 
third quarter of the nineteenth century, Pestalozzianism, 
though somewhat formalized, had a prevailing influence 
upon the teachers and courses of the elementary schools 
in the United States. 
Pestalozzi’s Industrial Training Continued by Fellen- 
berg.—Such was the wide influence of Pestalozzi upon 
education. But while throughout his work he main- 
tained and made new applications of his observational ¢ 
methods, his principle of combining industrial training 
with intellectual education, which he had begun so suc- his cessfully at Neuhof and Stanz, could not be continued at After Pesta-

Burgdorf.! His pupils there came chiefly from aristo- 
cratic families and were not obliged to support themselves 
by manual labor. However, Pestalozzi still hoped to save 
enough of the income from the school paymentsof the rich 
to found a small agricultural school for the poor on this 
plan and connect it with the ‘institute.’ And although 
most of those who thronged about him, including teach- 
ers, failed to understand how effective an instrument for 
training the young could be made of manual labor under 
skillful supervision, the lesson of Pestalozzi was not al- 
together lost upon true philanthropists. It foreshad- 
owed a new light that was destined to be thrown upon 
education. The opportunity for carrying out this aim 
came through his friend, Philipp Emanuel von Fellen- 
berg (1771-1844). 
Fellenberg belonged to a wealthy and noble family of 
Berne. His father was cultivated and learned, and his 
mother religious and well educated. He had been pre- 
pared for a diplomatic career, but a more unselfish view 
of life had been presented to him by his mother’s coun- 
sel: “The rich have always helpers enough, help thou 
the poor.” The altruistic impulse thus given him, and 
an interest in the experiments of Pestalozzi, who was a 
friend of his father, were decidedly strengthened by his 
marriage to the granddaughter of an influential and phil- 
anthropic friend of the great Swiss reformer. Like Pes- 
talozzi, Fellenberg believed that an amelioration of the 
wretched moral and economic conditions in Switzerland 
could be accomplished only through education. To se- 
cure the means for an experiment in this direction, he 
persuaded his father to purchase for him an estate of six

hundred acres at Hofwyl, just nine miles from Burgdorf. 
Here Pestalozzi urged him to undertake his favérite idea 
of industrial education, and when that educator removed 
to Miinchen-Buchsee, just a ten minute walk from Hof- 
wyl, the attempted union of their efforts mentioned ear- 
lier in the chapter ! was made. As a result of the marked 
difference in the temperament of the two men, so close a 
coéperation did not prove feasible, and Pestalozzi soon 
withdrew, but their friendship remained unbroken and 
Fellenberg even sent one of his sons to Yverdon to be 
educated. After the departure of the great educator, 
Fellenberg decided to continue the experiment, and in 
1806, with the aid of Zeller,? who had been sent him by 
Pestalozzi, he opened a school to train teachers in the 
Pestalozzian method. 
The Agricultural School and Other Institutions at 
Hofwyl.—Fellenberg especially desired, however, to com- 
bine Pestalozzi’s observational work and his older prin- 
ciple of industrial training in an ‘ agricultural institute’ 
for poor boys. This plan was not fully realized until he 
secured in 1808 as an assistant the young and en- 
thusiastic Jacob Wehrli. Wehrli soon convinced Fel- 
lenberg of his ability to change the most unmanageable 
vagabonds into industrious members of society, but some 
experimentation with four young paupers was necessary 
before the school was well started. The work was so ar- 
ranged that each old pupil, as fast as he was trained, took 
charge of a newer one as an apprentice, and the school 
from the first became a sort of family. The chief feature 
of the institute was agricultural occupations, including 
drainage and irrigation, but from the requirements of farm

life it was natural to develop other employments and to 
train cartmakers, blacksmiths, carpenters, locksmiths, 
shoemakers, tailors, mechanics, and workers in wood, 
iron, and leather. Workshops for these trades were estab- 
lished upon the estate, and the pupils in the agricultural 
institute were enabled to select a training in a wide 
range of employments, without neglecting book instruc- 
tion. By this means, too, they could support themselves 
by their labor while being educated. Through the in- 
stitute also a considerable number of the pupils were 
trained to be directors of similar institutions or to become 
tural school-teachers. Fellenberg thought it important 
that all who were to teach in the common schools should 
have a thorough acquaintance with the practical labor of 
a farm, the means of self-support, and the life and habits 
of the majority of their pupils. 
But the work of Fellenberg did not stop there. From 
the beginning he had felt that the wealthy should under- 
stand and be more in sympathy with the laboring classes, 
and learn how to direct their work more intelligently. 
Hence he began very early an agricultural course for 
landowners, and many young men of the wealthy classes 
came to show a striking interest in his deep-soil plough- 
ing, draining, irrigating, and other means of educating 
the poor, But these wealthier youths remained at the 
institute so short a time that he could not extend his ideals 
very widely. To retain them longer at Hofwy]l, in 1809 he 
opened a ‘literary institute,’ which, besides the usual 
academic studies, used Pestalozzi’s object lessons and 
strove to develop physical activities. Moreover, the 
pupils in the literary institute had to cultivate gardens, 
work on the farm, engage in carpentering, turning, and
-P-A-G-E-175
INDUSTRIAL TRAINING IN EDUCATION 157 
other mechanical occupations, and in many ways come 
into touch and mutual understanding with the poorer boys 
in the agricultural institute. The wealthy learned to dig- 
nify labor, and the poor, instead of envying those in the 
higher stations of life, became friendly and desirous of 
codperating with them. Eventually there arose an in- 
dependent community of youth, managing its own affairs 
outside of school, arranging its own occupations, games, 
and tours, choosing its own officers, and making its own 
laws. Within this little world was provided a training 
for society at large, with its various classes, associations, 
and corporations, which Fellenberg seems to have re- 
garded as divinely ordained. Likewise, in 1823, a school 
for poor girls was opened by his wife, and four years 
later he started a ‘real,’ or practical, school for the middle 
classes, which was intermediate between the two ‘in- 
stitutes.’ 
Fellenberg’s Educational Aim and Course.—Thus Pes- 
talozzi’s principle of observation as the groundwork of 
memory was strengthened by Fellenberg’s emphasis upon 
actual doing. Manual activity Fellenberg felt to be a nec- | A ‘teal?

Fellenberg 
strove to com- 
essary complement to sense perception and object teach- . 
ing. “For what has been done,” said he, “and done with 
thought, will be retained more firmly by the memory, and 
will bring a surer experience than that which has been 
only seen or heard.” Even more than with Pestalozzi, the 
pupil was to be treated not as a mere recipient, but as an 
agent capable of collecting, arranging, and using his own 
ideas. From various letters of Fellenberg we have def- 
inite information concerning the details of the curriculum 
at Hofwyl. Besides the vocational training, the course 
in the agricultural institute included reading, writing,

arithmetic, religion, drawing, singing, history, geography, 
natural history, botany, and geometry, or about the 
same range of subjects as was dealt with in Pestalozzi’s 
‘institute.’ The curriculum in the school for girls must 
have been very similar, except that the industrial work 
consisted of the household arts,—cooking, washing, 
cleaning, spinning, and knitting. In the course for 
teachers, beside manual labor on the farm, special train- 
ing was given in grammar, religion, drawing, geography, 
history of Switzerland, agriculture, and ‘anthropology,’ 
which included physiology, hygiene, and first aid to the 
injured. Those who seemed qualified for a more thorough 
course were allowed to elect work in the literary institute. 
The professional training consisted in a thorough study

gymnastics, military exercises, swimming, riding, walking, 
and skating. As in the other courses, religious studies also 
had an important place. 
Industrial Training in the Schools of Europe.—The 
educational institutions of Fellenberg were well managed 
and proved very successful. The number of pupils in the 
agricultural institute soon increased from a mere family 
circle to over one hundred and fifty, and the idea of

gradually declined, their principles became embodied in 
education everywhere. Various types of industrial edu- 
cation came to supplement academic courses, and ex- 
tend the work of the school to a larger number of pupils. 
Thus the tendency of modern civilization to care for 
the education of the unfortunate through industrial 
training has sprung from the philanthropic spirit of Pes- 
talozzi and his practical collaborator, Fellenberg, and 
their endeavors to furnish educational opportunities for 
all. The poor, the defective, and the delinquent have, 
through vocational training, been redeemed and given a 
chance in life, and many children have been kept in 
school that would inevitably have fallen by the wayside. 
Public schools, special industrial schools, orphanages, in- 
stitutions for the deaf and blind, reformatories, and even 
prisons have yielded rich harvests because of Pestalozzi’s 
first sowing. 
Movements of this sort have been apparent in all ad- 
vanced countries. The industrial institutions rapidly 
increased in Switzerland, beginning in 1816 with the 
school in the neighboring district of Meykirch. In 1832 
a cantonal teachers’ association was formed at Berne, with 
Fellenberg as president and Wehrli as vice president, to 
reform the methods of organization and instruction cur- 
rent in Switzerland. Every canton soon had its ‘farm 
school,’ in which, wrote Henry Barnard, “the school in- 
struction occupies three hours in the summer and four in 
winter; the remainder of the day being devoted to work 
in the field or garden, or at certain seasons of the year 
and for a class of pupils, in some indoor trade or craft.”

object of the industrial work in these institutions was 
to enable students to earn their way through school 
or college and recruit sectarian ranks during a period of 
strong denominational controversy. The other great 
argument for this training was that it secured physical 
exercise for those under the strain of severe intellectual 
labor. It was the first serious academic recognition of the 
need of a ‘sound mind in a sound body,’ and did much to 
overcome the prevailing tendency of students toward tu- 
berculosis and to furnish a sane substitute for the esca- 
pades and pranks in which college life abounded. The 
first of these manual labor institutions were established 
in the New England and Middle States between 1820 
and 1830, and within a dozen years the manual labor 
system was adopted in theological schools, colleges, and 
academies from Maine to Tennessee. The success of this 
feature at Andover Theological Seminary, where it was 
begun in 1826 for ‘invigorating and preserving health, 
without any reference to pecuniary profit,’ was especially 
influential in causing it to be extended. Much impetus 
was also given the movement through the writings 
and addresses of Rev. Elias Cornelius, secretary of the 
American Educational Society, who perceived the ter- 
rible inroads made upon health by education without sys- 
tematic exercise. From 1830 to 1832 many articles and 
lectures describing and commending the Fellenberg system 
were read before learned societies and published in the 
leading educational journals. The ‘Society for Promot- 
ing Manual Labor in Literary Institutions,’ founded in 
1831, appointed a general agent to visit the chief colleges 
in the Middle West and South, call attention to the value 
of manual labor, and issue a report upon the subject.
-P-A-G-E-180
              but, as mate- 
vial conditions 
improved, the 
industrial 
features were 
given up. 
Industrial 
education has 
also been 
adopted for 
of the public 
system. 162 A HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
Little attention, however, was given in the literary in- 
stitutions to the pedagogical principles underlying this 
work. As material conditions improved and formal so- 
cial life developed, the impracticability of the scheme was 
realized, and the industrial side of these institutions was 
given up. This physical phase was then replaced by col- 
lege athletics, By 1840-50 most of the schools and col- 
leges that began as ‘ manual labor institutes’ had become 
purely literary. 
A further movement in industrial education was found 
in the establishment of such schools as Carlisle, Hampton, 
and Tuskegee, which adopted this training as a solution 
for peculiar racial problems. But the original idea of 
« Pestalozzi, to secure redemption through manual labor 
was not embodied in American institutions until the last 
quarter of the century. After 1873, when Miss Mary 
Carpenter, the English prison reformer, visited the United 
States, contract labor and factory work in the reforma- 
tories began to be replaced by farming, gardening, and 
kindred domestic industries. At the present time, more- 
over, the schools for delinquents and defectives in the New 
England, Middle Atlantic, Middle West, and most of the 
Southern states, have the Fellenberg training, though 
without much grasp of the educational principles involved. 
Finally, within the last decade there has also been a grow- 
ing tendency to employ industrial training or trade edu- 
cation for the sake of holding pupils longer in school and 
increasing the efficiency of the public system. In so far as 
it has tended to replace the more general values of man- 
ual training, once so popular, with skill in some partic- 
ular industrial process, this modern movement represents 
areturn from the executive occupational work started by

Froebel ! to the philanthropic practice of Fellenberg and 
Pestalozzi. 
Hence it was largely through the practical’ develop- 
ment of this great disciple at Hofwyl that Pestalozzi 
bas had a marked influence upon the social, as well as 
upon the psychological, movement in modern education.

, CHAPTER VI 
THE COMMON SCHOOL REVIVAL IN NEW ENGLAND 
Location, Time, and Scope of the Revival.—The in- 
terest in the improved methods of Pestalozzi and other 
reformers that was manifesting itself everywhere in the 
United States during the second quarter of the nine- 
teenth century seems to have been but one phase of a 
much larger movement. This awakening has been gen- 
erally known as ‘the common school revival,’ ! which 
first became influential during the latter part of the dec- 
ade between 1830 and 1840. It had its storm center in 
New England, since this portion of the United States had 
especially fallen into an educational decadence, but every- 
where it greatly furthered the cause of public education, 
which had as yet not made a marked advance in any 
state. 
As we have found in Chapter IV, half a dozen of 
the states had started an organization of common 
schools, and in a dozen others permanent school funds had 
been started, an influential minority of leading citizens 
were constantly advocating universal education, and pub- 
‘Revival’ is an unfortunate term that has come to be accepted 
through long usage. It belongs to medival philosophy, and, if we hold 
to evolution and progress, it scarcely conveys our meaning. While its 
general use is recognized, it has been avoided here and in other chap- 
ters as far as possible. It more nearly affords an accurate description of 
the movement in New England than in the other parts of the country, 
since educational conditions there had actually retrograded. 
165 During the 
second quar- 
ter of the 
nineteenth 
century there 
took place a 
remarkably - 
rapid ad- 
vance in pub- 
lic education, 
which has 
been gener- 
ally known as 
‘the common 
school re- 
vival.’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
166 A HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
lic interest in the matter was evidently increasing. But 
the consummation of a regular system was still much hin- 
dered by sectarian jealousies, by the conception of public 
schools as institutions for paupers and the consequent 
custom of allowing private schools to share in public 
funds, and by the unwillingness of the wealthy to be 
taxed locally for the benefit of other people’s children. 
While these obstacles had not been apparent in Mas- 
sachusetts and Connecticut, the systems in these states 
were further hampered by the division into autonomous 
districts and by the interference of petty politics, and 
had, in consequence, sadly declined. Educational ideals 
were everywhere in evident need of expansion and further 
democratization, and school methods and curricula, as 
ell as organization, cried aloud for radical revision. 
As a result of the reform movement, a great work had, 
been accomplished before the middle of the century, and 
its influence was felt up to the close. The common 
schools rapidly increased, and high schools, the true 
American product in secondary education, began to be 
introduced everywhere. Appropriations for public edu- 
cation were multiplied, and salaries became large enough 
to attract better teachers to the public schools. Normal 
schools were established to give an adequate training, and 
paid supervision became part of the system. Text-books 
and methods were greatly improved. As the demand for 
an awakening was most felt in New England, and the 
movement was most in evidence there and was stimu- 
lated by the work of several of the greatest reformers, we 
shall bere limit the discussion to that part of the country 
and reserve the account of progress elsewhere during this 
period for a later chapter.

Early Leaders in the Awakening.—In this awakening While Horace 
the most conspicuous figure is probably Horace Mann, but the most co con- 
spicuous 
the there were several leaders in the field before him, many feure, 
were contemporaneous, and the work was expanded and 
deepened by others of distinction long after he withdrew 
from the scene. For a score of years before Mann ap- 
peared, definite preparation for the movement had been 
in progress, and the labors of the individuals and associ- 
ations engaged in these endeavors should be briefly noted. 
Many of the efforts seem to have aimed at an improve- 
ment in methods through the creation of an institution 
for training teachers, thus anticipating one of the great- 
est achievements of Mann. As early as 1816 Denison 
Olmstead, at that time principal of a ‘union’ school at 
_New London, in his master’s oration at Yale urged that 
a seminary for the gratuitous training of schoolmasters 
be opened, and proposed a curriculum of review work, 
methods, school organization, and government, but met 
with little response. Seven years later, J, L, Kingsley, a 
professor in Yale, made a forceful argument in the North 
American Review for a similar proposition. In 1823 Wil- 
liam Russell, principal of an academy in New Haven, pub- 
lished his Suggestions on Education, in which he held that 
better preparation should be made for teaching through 
the establishment of a professional school. Two years 
after this, the Rev. T. H. Gallaudet issued a series of able 
articles on normal instruction, including an experimental 
school, which were republished and given a wide circula- 
tion. About this time also actual attempts at a private 
normal school were made by the Rev. Samuel R. Hall 
at Concord, Vermont (1823), Andover, .Massachusetts 
(1830), and Plymouth, New Hampshire (1837). movement i

But the great-

made by 168 A HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
Likewise, there were several associations, like the 
‘American Institute of Instruction,’ founded in the in- 
terest of common schools during this period. A number 
of educational journals, moreover, published articles on 
schoolbooks, the methods of Lancaster, Pestalozzi, Neef, 
Fellenberg, the infant and Sunday schools, physical edu- 
cation, European school systems, and a variety of other 
timely topics and reforms. Among these progressive pub- 
lications were the Academician, published in New York 
by Albert and John W. Pickett, 1818-1820; the Teacher’s 
Guide and Parent’s Assistant, issued at Portland, Maine, 
1826-1827; the American Journal of Education, edited by 
William Russell from 1826 to 1830, and then continued 
from 1831 to 1839, as the American Annals of Education 
under the editorship of William C. Woodbridge, and the 
Quarierly Register, published 1828-1843 by the ‘Amer- 
ican Educational Society.’ The latest European ideas 
were also reported from first-hand observation by a num- 
ber who had gone abroad to investigate. The most in- 
fluential of these reports was A Year in Europe, written 
in 1819 by Professor John Griscom, who was a lecturer 
before several New York associations, including the Pub- 
lic School Society.! Almost as widely read were the 
reports of William C. Woodbridge, who visited Europe 
in 1820-1824; of Professor Calvin E. Stowe of Lane The- 
ological Seminary, Cincinnati, in 1836; and of Alexander 
D. Bache, first president of Girard College, Philadelphia, 
in 1839. 
Work of James G. Carter.—All these movements indi- 
cate the educational férment that was going on. But the 
predecessor of Mann, who accomplished most for the

common schools, and influenced that reformer most di- 
rectly was James G. Carier (1795-1849). Henry Barnard 
declares that to Carter “‘more than to any other one 
person belongs the credit of having first attracted the at- 
tention of the leading minds of Massachusetts to the ne- 
cessity of immediate and thorough improvement in the 
-system of free or public schools.” Carter was a practical 
teacher and wrote continually in the newspapers, espe- 
cially on the need of a normal institution to improve in- 
struction in the public schools. These popular appeals, 
which he began about 1824, proved very successful. His 
constructive Outlines of an Institution for the Education of 
Teachers, which was widely circulated and reviewed, has 
earned him the title of ‘father of the normal schools.’ 
After being elected to the legislature, he accomplished 
much by his zeal and his skill in parliamentary tactics. 
Through him a bill was passed in 1826 to reform the deca- 
dent system of Massachusetts. By it each town as a 
whole was required to choose a regular committee, instead 
of the ministers and selectmen, to supervise the schools, 
choose text-books, and examine, certify, and employ the 
teachers. The act was strenuously opposed by many dis- 
tricts, on the ground that it deprived them of their accus- 
tomed rights of local autonomy, and the following year 
the districts were allowed, as a sop, to choose a commit- 
'teeman, who should appoint the teachers. The effect of 
the law of 1826 was largely spoiled by this compromise, 
but the enactment proved a first step toward the central- 
ization and supervision of schools. In 1826 an effort was 
also made to place secondary education, which was largely 
conducted by academies, more under public control. A 
law was passed, requiring each town of five hundred fami- James G.

lies to support a free English high school, and every one 0 
four thousand inhabitants to maintain a classical hig 
school, in which pupils could be fitted for college. Next, 
in 1834, Carter succeeded in getting a state school fun 
established from the proceeds of the sale of lands in the 
province of Maine and-the state’s claims against the fed- 
eral government for military services. By this act the| 
income was distributed only to those towns which raised 
one dollar ‘of taxation for every child of school age, and 
made the returns required by the state. But Carter’s 
greatest and most fruitful victory was won in €837 when 
he managed to procure the passage of the bill for a State 
Board of Education, after it had been once defeated, by 
inducing the house to discuss it in ‘committee of the 
whole.’ 
Horace Mann as Secretary of the Massachusetts 
Board.—By reason of his merits as an educator, his per- 
sistent efforts in behalf of educational reform, and his 
advocacy of the bill, it was assumed by most people that 
Carter would be chosen as secretary of the new board. To 
their surprise, a lawyer named Horace Mann (1796-1859), 
at that time president of the senate, was selected for the 
post, but the choice is now known to have been most for- 
tunate. By both heredity and training Mann was suffused 
with an interest in humanity and all phases of philan- 
thropy, especially education. He possessed a happy com- 
bination of lofty ideals, intelligence, courage, enthusiasm, 
and legislative experience, which equipped him admirably 
for leadership in educational reform. The law proposed 
for the new Board of Education numerous duties in the 
way of collecting and spreading information concerning 
the common schools and of making suggestions for the
-P-A-G-E-189
COMMON SCHOOL REVIVAL IN NEW ENGLAND 171 
improvement and extension of public education, but it 
provided no real powers. It was obvious that the per- 
manence and influence of the board would depend al- 
most wholly upon the intelligence and character of its 
secretary, and the peculiar fitness of Horace Mann can 
alone account for his selection. 
Aids and Obstacles to Mann’s Reforms.—At any rate, 
during the twelve years he held the secretaryship, Mann 
subserved the interests of the state most faithfully. To 
awaken the people, the new secretary at once started 
upon an educational campaign through the state, and dur- 
ing each year of his tenure he made an annual circuit for 
this purpose. Besides the regular trips, Mann held him- 
self subject to calls from everywhere, within the state and 
out, for educational meetings, lectures, and addresses; 
and when, after seven years, teachers’ institutes were in- 
troduced into Massachusetts, he constantly served as an 
efficient lecturer and instructor. An even more effective 
means of disseminating Mann’s reforms was found in the 
series of Annual Reports, which he issued from the first, 
and in the publication of his Massachusetts Common c 
School Journal, begun in the second year of his adminis- 
tration. The Reporis were by law to give information 
concerning existing conditions and the progress made in 
the efficiency of public education each year, and to discuss 
the most approved organization, content, and methods 
for the common schools, in order to create and guide pub- 
lic opinion most intelligently. While practically every ed- 
ucational topic of importance at the time is dealt with, his 
suggestions as a whole maintain a definite point of view 
and a connected body of practical doctrine. Sometimes 
they seem commonplace, but it must be remembered that His chief

they were not so then, and that the work of Marin di 
much to render them familiar. While address ~~ 
State Board, they were really intended for the « 
Massachusetts in general, and their influence w: 
beyond the confines of the state. They vitall: 
school conditions everywhere in New England, 
read with great interest in all parts of the Unit: 
and even in Europe. The Journal, on the other hauu, was 
issued semi-monthly and consisted of only sixteen pages 
to each number. It was devoted to spreading information 
concerning school improvement, school law, and the pro- 
ceedings of the State Board, and it urged upon school 
officials, parents, and children their duties toward health, 
morals, and intelligence, but was not as valuable as 
some of the educational journals that had preceded it. 
Another medium in the improvement of educational facil- 
ities was Mann’s general establishment of school libraries 
by state subsidy throughout Massachusetts. But proba- 
bly the most permanent means of stimulating the awak- 
ening and propagating the reforms led by Horace Mann 
was the foundation by Massachusetts of the first public 
normal schools in this country. A devoted friend of 
Mann offered to donate ten thousand dollars for this 
purpose, in case the state would supply a like amount. 
This generous proposal was accepted by the legislature 
in 1838. It was decided to found three schools, so 
located that all parts of the state might be equally 
served. The course consisted in a review of the com- 
mon branches from the teaching point of view, work in 
educational theory, and training in a practice school 
under supervision. Despite the hostility of conserva- 
tives, incompetent teachers, and sectarian dogmatists,
-P-A-G-E-191
COMMON SCHOOL REVIVAL IN NEW ENGLAND 173 
these schools, while not largely attended, were a great 
success from the start. 
The arduous and unremitting labors of Mann in in- 
stituting and promoting the various means of school re- 
form must have made the greatest inroad upon his 
strength and financial resources. He was frequently af- 
flicted with insomnia for weeks, and his income never 
amounted to a living wage. But a more trying obstacle 
that the reformer had to contend with was the dense con- 
servatism and bitter prejudices often animating people 
that he felt ought eagerly to have supported him. The 
Board and its secretary were for years violently assailed 
by reactionaries of all types. Attempts were early made 
in the legislature to abolish the Board of Education or 
to have its duties and powers transferred to the governor 
and council, but after a fierce fight this type of opposition 
ceased. Mann’s controversy with the Boston school- 
masters was also sharp, but decisive. His Seventh An- 
nual Report (1843) gave an account of his visit to foreign 
schools, especially those of Germany, and praised with 
great warmth the ‘Pestalozzian’} instruction without 
text-books, the enthusiastic teachers, the absence of arti- 
ficial rivalry, and the mild discipline in the Prussian sys- 
tem. The report did not stigmatize the conservatism of 
the Boston schools or bring them into comparison with 
those of Berlin, but the cap fitted. The pedagogues were 
disquieted, and proceeded to answer savagely. But when 
the smoke of battle had cleared away, it was seen that the 
leaders of the old order had been completely routed. A 
more insidious attack was that led by the ultra-orthodox.

accomplishments. But while the public school should 
cultivate a moral and religious spirit, this could not be ac- 
complished, he felt, by inculcating sectarian doctrines. 
The main objection urged to the private school system in 
his First Report was its tendency “to assimilate our 
modes of education to those of England, where Church- 
men and Dissenters, each sect according to its creed, 
maintain separate schools in which children are taught 
from their tenderest years to wield the sword of polemics 
with fatal dexterity.” 
But Mann was mainly a practical, rather than a theo- 
retical, reformer. To the material side of education, he 
gave serious attention. He declared that school buildings 
should be well constructed and sanitary. This matter 
seemed to him so important that he wrote a special report 
upon the subject during his first year in office. He care- 
fully discussed the proper plans for rooms, ventilation, 
lighting, seating, and other schoolhouse features, and in- 
sisted that the inadequate and squalid conditions which 
existed should be improved. In his Fourth Report also 
he considered many of the physical evils, especially 
those arising from pupils. of all ages being in the same 
room. He found that in many cases this was the result of 
a multiplication of districts, and suggested ‘union’ schools 
or consolidation as a remedy. As to methods, he main- 
tained that instruction should be based upon scientific 
principles, and not upon authority and tradition. Pesta- 
lozzi’s inductive method of teaching received his approval, 
for he felt that the pupils should be introduced at first 
hand to the facts of the humanitiesand sciences. The work 
should be guided by able teachers, who had been trained 
in a normal school, and should be imparted in a spirit of He also

mildness and kindness through an understanding of child 
nature. The teachers, who should be men as well as 
women, ought also to supplement their training and expe- 
rience by frequently gathering in associations and insti- 
tutes. In the matter of the studies to be pursued, Mann 
was inclined to be over-practical. In discussing educa- 
tional values, he failed to see any reason “why algebra, 
a branch which not one man in a thousand ever has occa- 
sion to use in the business of life, should be studied by 
more than twenty-three hundred pupils, and bookkeeping, 
which every man, even the day laborer, should under- 
stand, should be attended to by only a little more than 
half that number.” Similarly, he holds that of all sub- 
jects, except the rudiments, physiology should receive the 
most attention, and he writes an extended essay upon its 
use and value. He exaggerates the importance of this 
subject, possibly as a result of his devotion to phrenol- 
ogy; but in his whole espousal of subjects that will pre- 
pare for concrete living, he seems close to Spencer’s test . 
of “what knowledge is of the most worth.” 1 ; 
In order that these various reforms might be realized, 
Mann insisted frequently that the state should spare no 
labor or expense. But in a republic he felt that “educa- 
tion can never be attained without the consent of. the 
whole people.” ‘All improvements in the school sup- 
pose and require a corresponding and simultaneous im- 
provement in public sentiment.” It was such a general 
elevation of ideals, effort, and expenditure that Horace 
Mann sought, and for which he began his crusade. He 
was a man of action, and not a philosopher. Nor was he 
the only reformer of the times, as we have been prone to

believe in our admiration for his moral earnestness and 
great devotion. But it was just such ethical characteris- 
tics as his that were needed to achieve the desired reforms, 
and that largely account for the numerous practical re- 
sults accomplished during his time. And the evident 
progress made in this period covers a wide range. During 
the twelve years of Mann’s secretaryship, the appropria- 
tions made for public education in Massachusetts were 
more than doubled. Through this rise in enthusiasm for 
public education, the proportion of expenditure for pri- 
vate schools in the state was reduced from seventy-five to 
thirty-six per cent of the total cost of schools. The sal- th 
aries of masters in the public schools were raised sixty-two 
per cent, and, although the number of women teachers had ? 
grown fifty-four per cent, the average of their salaries was 
also increased fifty-one per cent. The school attendance 
enormously expanded both absolutely and relatively to 
the growth of population, and a full month was added to 
the average school year. When Mann’s administration 
began, but fourteen out of forty-three towns had complied 
with the high school law of 1826, but, by the middle of 
the century, fifty new high schools had been established, 
and the opportunities for secondary education under 
public control, which had been declining for half a cen- 
tury, were greatly enlarged. While the time for a full 
appreciation of skilled school superintendents had not 
yet arrived, the efficiency of supervision was largely 
increased by making the compensation of the town 
visiting committees, established through Carter, com- 
pulsory by law. The first state normal schools at

of teaching. Teachers’ institutes, county associations, He was not ff

and public school libraries were given general popu- 
larity. 
Quite as marked was the improvement effected in the 
range and serviceability of the school studies, in text-books, 
methods of teaching, and discipline. While not a remark- 
able educationalist himself, Mann rendered practical and 
brought into use many of the contributions made to educa- 
tional theory by others, and thereby anticipated many of 
the features of later educational practice. The word 
method of reading took the place of the uneconomical, ar- 
tificial, and ineffective method of the alphabet, and the 
Pestalozzian object methods and oral instruction were in- 
troduced. The connection between physical and mental 
health and development became better understood. Thus 
during this educational awakening the people of Massa- 
chusetts renewed their faith in the common schools. Mann 
was assisted by many progressive educators and teachers 
of the times and a sympathetic Board of Education, but 
under his leadership a practically unorganized set of 
schools, with diverse aims and methods, was welded into a 
well-ordered system with high ideals. The experiment of 
state school administration under the control of a board 
and secretary proved to be so satisfactory that until 1908 
it retained vogue in Massachusetts. Even now the only

the awakening made by a New Englander, which was of a A different 
rather different nature from that connected with the in- 
fluence of Horace Mann. Before that reconstruction of ® 
thecommon schools, which was responsible for the best ele- 
ments in our national civilization, could be at all complete, 
it was necessary that America should have a better com- 
prehension of what was being done in education elsewhere. 
The United States had for two centuries been undergoing 
a gradual transition from the institutional types trans- 
planted from England and the Continent in colonial days, 
and was coming more and more to blossom out into 
democracy and the people’s schools, but for a long time 
there was little knowledge of what was being done by the 
other countries that had by this time adopted similar 
ideals. Conceptions of universal and democratic educa~- 
tion and of improved organization and methods had 
slowly developed in Prussia and other German states, and 
had extended to France and even to Holland, Denmark, 
and Sweden. A literature connected with the advanced 
theories of such reformers as Rousseau, the philanthrop- 
inists, Pestalozzi, and Fellenberg had likewise grown up 
in Europe. It was very important that America, now 
keenly alive to the need of educational reorganization, 
should become acquainted with all this, that the new 
world might secure the advantages of comparison, corrob- 
oration, and expansion of view from the work of older civi- 
lized peoples. For this it did not need to imitate slavishly 
or adopt wholesale, but it might find in the example of 
other lands suggestions to be modified and adapted to its 
needs.

had been going on before the awakening was well 
under way, especially through the reports of Americans 
that had inspected the educational systems of Europe or 
had visited places where the educational experiments of 
the various reformers were conducted. It has likewise 
been indicated that a number of treatises on foreign 
schools, methods, and organization had been published 
in a series of educational journals that had sprung up in 
the United States. A few European accounts, like that of 
Cousin,’ had also been translated. Suggestions of elab- 
orate systems of popular instruction for one state or 
another had several times been published. The Mora- 
vians had brought in the educational ideals of Comenius; ” 
Lancaster had come to this side of the Atlantic to exploit 
his system further; * and Neef had introduced the methods 
of his master, Pestalozzi, into Pennsylvania and else- 
where; ‘ and Mann himself, while hampered by an im- 
perfect knowledge of modern languages, had been pro~ 
foundly influenced by Europe.’ But the time was now 
ripe for a more extensive and systematic exposition of 
European education and its application to popular educa- 
tion in America, and for a really capable scholar to bring 
these world views within the grasp of all classes of teachers 
and educational authorities. .

America. While still in his teens, Barnard had made a

brilliant record at Yale for general scholarship, and a 
position as assistant librarian during his last two years 
in college did much to afford him a wide grasp of bib- 
liography. After graduation, he had obtained a valuable 
experience in teaching, and, by travelling extensively in 
America and Europe, he had formed a broad acquaint- 
ance with educational institutions, libraries, galleries, 
and social conditions in all the leading states and 
nations. 
Although Barnard’s real work was found in his accounts 
of European schools and education, he frequently occu- 
pied important places in educational administration and 
performed many direct services for American schools. 
For this mission his first opportunity came in his native 
state. Two years after his return to Connecticut, he be- 
gan his part in the educational awakening as secretary of 
the new State Board of Commissioners of Common 
Schools, and undertook to do a work similar to that of F¥ 
Mann in Massachusetts. The public schools of the state 
certainly stood in need of reforms. Throughout the 
eighteenth century Connecticut schools had been among 
themost efficient-in the country, but since theincome from 
the Western Reserve lands had begun, in 1798, and es- { 
pecially after this had been increased by the United States 
deposit fund in 1836, public education had steadily de- 
clined. A state tax was still maintained, but all local ef- 
fort was paralyzed through lack of exercise. No doubt, 
too, this unwillingness to tax the locality had been in- 
creased by the transferal of the entire management of the 
common schools from the town to the ‘school society,’ 
which was a species of district, almost identical with the 
narish of each Puritan or Congregational church. The re- practical serv.

sults of this ruinous policy had been revealed 
tigation made by the legislature. The report « 
tee showed that not one-half of the children c: 
were attending the common schools, that 1 
were poorly trained and supervision was neg: 
there was little attention given to courses of s! 
ings, or equipment, and that there was liitue goucias 
education beyond elementary work. 
Add to this the fact that the masses of the people 
supposed that Connecticut still led in popular education 
and were perfectly satisfied, and it can be seen how des- 
perate was the situation to be overcome. The board had 
little authority, except to inspect, report, and stimulate 
the common schools through its secretary. In his re- 
ports, however, Barnard made suggestions for a complete 
plan of reformed public education, gave practical advice 
concerning school buildings, distribution of school money, 
the need of local taxation, uniform schoolbooks, grading 
of schools, a public seminary for secondary instruction, 
the duties of school visitors, and the professionalization 
and permanency of teachers. In these documents and 
in the Connecticut Common School Journal that he estab- 
lished, he began his rich collection of material bearing 
upon popular education at home and abroad. But Bar- 
nard was more a scholar and literary man than an educa- 
tional statesman like Mann. He succeeded in getting 
the legislature to pass several reforms and a general revi- 
sion and codification of the school laws, and in arousing 
several towns to amend their educational plans, but the 
erucial difficulty of the ‘school societies’ could not be 
touched and seems to have been carefully avoided in all 
his discussions. He did, however, force the conservatives
-P-A-G-E-201

to throw off the mask of indifference and meet him with 
open opposition. At the end of four years they suc- 
ceeded in legislating him out of office and in undoing all 
his reforms. 
Commissioner of Common Schools in Rhode Island.— 
This gave Barnard an opportunity to pursue his favorite 
investigations, and for about a year and a half he was 
engaged in collecting material for a history of education 
in the United States. Then he was persuaded by the 
governor of Rhode Island to become the first Coramis- 
sioner of Common Schools for that state. While he found si 
in Rhode Island a better educational sentiment and less © 
opposition than in Connecticut, the actual condition of 
the decentralized and individualistic schools was far 
worse.' But, through his assemblies of teachers and ™dical 
parents and his educational treatises, he soon began to 
convince the people of the unwisdom of district organiza- 
tion, untrained teachers, short terms, irregular attend- 
ance, poor buildings and ventilation, and meager equip- 
ment. He also continued to publish his collection of 
educational material through the foundation of the 
Rhode Island School Journal. As a. result of his efforts, 
when failing health compelled him to resign in 1849, the 
state no longer regarded wilfulness and personal opinion 
as praiseworthy independence, and he could honestly 
claim that Rhode Island had at the time one of the best 
school systems in the United States. 
State Superintendent of Schools in Connecticut.— 
But the clientéle that Barnard had built up in Connecti- 
cut continued his reforms and constructive work after his 
‘departure, and improved upon them. In 1851, they even

of his adherents. The state ha:

his most distinctive work, as might be expected, was on 
the literary side. He prepared a valuable series of doc- 
uments upon foreign education, normal schools, methods 
of teaching, school architecture, and other topics, and a 
long report upon The History of Legislation in. Connecti- 
cut Respecting Common Schools up to 1838. This last 
document was not merely a record of legislation, but a 
detailed and interesting history of education in Connec- 
ticut, together with a sketch of educational effort in all 
the other states that had made any progress 
Barnard’s American Journal of Education.—It was, 
too, during the last days of his Connecticut superintend- 
ency that Henry Barnard suggested the establishment 
of a national journal of education. He first broached 
the matter to the ‘American Association for the Advance- 
ment of Education’ at its meeting in Washington, 
December, 1854. But the association soon found itself 
unable to pursue this enterprise for lack of financial 
support, and in May of the next year Barnard undertook
-P-A-G-E-203

it upon his own responsibility. In a general circular he 
announced his-intention to supply the need of “a series 
of publications, which should, on the one hand, embody 
the matured views and varied experience of wise states- 
men, educators, and teachers in perfecting the organiza- 
tion, administration, instruction, and discipline of schools 
in every grade through a succession of years, under 
widely varying circumstances of government, society, and 
religion; and, on the other hand, expose real deficiencies, 
excite fo prudent and efficient action, and serve as a 
medium of free and frequent communication between 
the friends of education in every portion of these great 
fields.” 
This was the beginning of the epoch-making work 
known as Barnard’s American Journal of Education. It 
was planned to run the journal for five years only, but 
the period of publication was extended from time to 
time through the editor’s realization of its importance. 
The work was somewhat interrupted upon occasions by 
other duties, but it continued for more than a generation, 
until at length thirty-one large octavo volumes, averaging 
about eight hundred pages each, had been issued. In 
addition, fifty-two special treatises reprinted from articles 
in the journal brought the material together in a con- 
nected way. Besides giving nearly all his time to editing 
this magnum opus, Barnard sank his entire fortune of 
$50,000 in its publication. Even then the returns were 
so small that the plates were kept from being consigned 
to the melting-pot, to meet his indebtedness, only at the 
eleventh hour by the formation of an organization of 
friends to save them. This great treasury of material

First United States Commissioner of Education.— 
Barnard was at various times offered the presidency of 
institutions of higher learning, but, with the exception of 
brief periods in the headship of the University of Wis- 
consin (1859-1861) and of St. John’s College, Maryland 
(1866-1867), he always declined to serve in this capacity. 
He must have learned that he was adapted neither by 
health nor temperament to an administrative position, 
and his interest was chiefly in the common schools and 
educational literature. In fact, even the connection 
with the University of Wisconsin appealed to him mostly 
because of what he hoped he might be able to do for 
popular education and for the training of teachers 
through the accompanying office of Agent of the Board 
of Normal Regents. His work at St. John’s College had 
barely started, when he was appointed the first United 
States Commissioner of Education. This office Barnard

had been constantly trying to have established ever since 
he had found, as Secretary of the Connecticut Board, 
how absolutely lacking the federal government was 
. in school statistics and educational documents. Upon 
several occasions he is recorded to have brought the 
matter before a national organization of teachers. He 
hoped especially to have the government, with its larger 
influence and greater means, perform the sort of service 
that he afterward undertook at his own expense in the 
American Journal of Education. In this way facilities 
might be secured to collect and publish reliable educa- 
tional statistics, and to issue a library of independent 
treatises, which should, when complete, form an ency- 
clopedia of education. 
The bureau was not created for many years, and then 
through the immediate initiative of another, but when 
Henry Barnard was called as first commissioner in 1867, 
he organized the office practically upon the lines he had 
previously suggested. He suspended his Journal and used 
the product of his investigations in the annual reports of 
the office. His wide experience with European and Amer- 
ican educational institutions and systems, together with 
his splendid library, enabled him to fill his publications 
with rich material and accomplish the work rapidly. He 
started that searching inquiry into the administration, 
management, and instruction of educational institutions 
of every grade, and into all educational societies, school 
funds, legislation, architecture, documents, and ben- 
efactions that have since been maintained by the Bureau 
of Education. However, within three years a change 
in the national administration brought a new incum- 
bent into the commissionership. Barnard then gave his He had hoped

necessary that some one should first gather the infor-

ographs, and plans, and publish it as it was found. In 
this way he accomplished a more valuable work than 
if he had published a systematic history of education 
in the United States. The Journal was his crowning 
work and a means of international repute. The exposi- 
tions of Vienna and Paris, as well as those in this country, 
decorated him with medals, and he was lauded by educa- 
tors in every land. This great thesaurus of information 
and enlightenment, in connection with the virile efforts 
of Mann and other practical leaders in education through- 
out the country, has made the American educational 
awakening one of the most fruitful in history, and has 
enabled it to become both an inspiration and a guide 
in the remarkable development of the common schools 
and state educational systems that has since taken place.

CHAPTER VII 
DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN EDUCATIONAL PRACTICE 
Froebel and Herbart as Disciples of Pestalozzi.— 
Before considering the educational development that 
took place later as a result of the awakening, it may 
now be well to take up some of the wider movements 
that have affected modern educational practice every- 
where. the discussion of naturalism, observation, and 
indus training, we have noted great improvements 
taking place in educational practice and have witnessed 
the rise of the psychological tendency in education. The 
germs of this, as of other modern educational movements, 
were found in the suggestions of Rousseau, and were 
developed into more constructive and practical sugges- 
Hons by the philanthropinists, Pestalozzi, and Fellenberg. 
: (The positions of Pestalozzi were somewhat vague and 
‘ -wete based upon sympathetic insight rather than sci- 
entific principles, but, besides leaving a direct, influence 
upon the teaching of certain subjects in the elementary 
curriculum, they became the basis of the elaborate 
systems offHerbart and Froebel) And the development 3 
of educational practice introduced by these latter edu- 
cators has most profoundly affected the content and 
method of the course in all stages of modern training. 
Herbart and Froebel may be regarded as contemporary 
disciples and interpreters of the Swiss reformer, who was-(22/

There were two very definite a. 
positions, which may at first seem Gppvovu w vucu venes, 
but are not necessarily contradictory. On the one hand, 
Pestalozzi seems to have held that education ~*-~'7 *- ~ 
natural development from within; on the ot, 
must consist in the derivation of ideas fron: 
with the outside world. The former point of .-... ..-—~ 
logically argue that every characteristic is innate and 
implicit in the child at birth in the exact form to which it 
is afterward to be developed, and that the teacher can 
at best only assist the child’s nature in the efforts for 
its own unfolding. This attitude Pestalozzi apparently 
borrowed from the psychology implied in Rousseau’s 
naturalism. The other conception of education as sense 
perception, which is evident in Pestalozzi’s observational 
methods,” depends upon the theory that immediate and 
direct impressions from the outside are the absolute 
basis of all knowledge, and holds that the contents of 
the mind must be entirely built up by the teacher. Some 
such naive interpretation has been common since specula- 
tion began, especially among teachers, and had been 
formulated in Pestalozzi’s day by Locké, Hume, and 
others. In the main, Froebel took the first of. these 
Pestalozzian viewpoints and rarely admits the other, but 
1 This view is especially revealed in the quotations concerning his 
educational aim, given in Chapter V, pp. 137f. 
2See pp. 1308.
-P-A-G-E-211
DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL PRACTICE 193 
the latter phase was developed by Herbart to the almost 
total disregard of the former. {Hence the one educator 
laid emphasis upon the ‘cnild’s development and activ- 
ities, and the the concerned himself with method and 
the work of the teacher.! The original contributions of 
both reformers to educational practice, however, were 
large, and are deserving of extended description. As 
Herbart began to formulate his principles somewhat 
before Froebel became interested in education, he will 
here be treated first. Herbart in 
general 
adopted the 
view of edu- 
cation as im- 
pressions 
from without, 
and con- 
cerned him- 
self mainly 
with method 
and_ the 
teacher. 
The Early Career and Writings of Herbart.—Johanm——— 
Friedrich Herbart (1776-1841) both by birth and by edu- 
cation possessed a remarkable mind and was well calcu- 
lated to become a profound educational philosopher. 
his traditions were intellectual. His paternal grandfather 
was rector of the gymnasium at Oldenburg, Herbart’s 
native town, and his father was a lawyer and privy coun- 
cilor there. Moreover, the mother of Herbart is known 
to have been ‘a rare and wonderful woman,’ who was 
able to assist her son in his favorite studies of Greek, 
mathematics, and philosophy. While still a youth in the 
1The Ruling Principle of Method by Antonio Rosmini-Serbati (1797~- 
1855) represents a third possible development of Pestalozzi’s theories. 
It seems to emphasize Pestalozzianism upon the emotional side, as do 
the doctrines of Herbart and Froebel upon the cognitional and volitional 
sides respectively. His professed aim was a natural development to 
moral perfection through obedience to law, human and divine, natural 
and revealed. The system also unites the ordered evolution of Froebel 
_and the apperception of Herbart. Although it grew out of his subtle 
system of metaphysics, and is not fully emancipated from the scholastic 
effort to reduce all intellectual processes to categories, it professes to 
adopt the observational attitude of modern science and the psychological 
method. However, outside of Italy, there were few schools conducted 
upon his principles, and his theories have exerted little influence upon 
educational practice. Herbart’s tra- 
ditions were

194 A HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
gymnasium, Herbart distinguished himself by writing 
essays upon moral freedom and other metaphysical sub- 
jects. At the University of Jena, under the inspiration 
of Fichte, he produced incisive critiques upon the trea- 
tises of that philosopher and of the other great idealist 
of the age, Schelling. He was also influenced here by the 
enthusiasm for Greek displayed by the advocates of ‘new 
humanism.’ This literary movement had its seat near 
Jena, at Weimar, the abode of Herder, Goethe, and 
Schiller. Herbart became an ardent student of the Odys- 
sey, and among other writings produced a treatise on 
some musical aspects of the epics of Homer. Likewise, 
pet he continued his interest in mathematics, and his train- 
            ing in each of the three subjects was destined to play a 
part in his educational theories. 
Just before graduation, however, Herbart left the uni- 
versity to become private tutor to the three sons of Herr 
von Steiger-Reggisberg, Governor of Interlaken, Switzer- 
land. During the period of almost three years (1797- 
1799) that he occupied this position, he obtained a most 
valuable practical experience. He was required by his 
patron to make bi-monthly a written report of the meth- 
ods he used and of his pupils’ progress in their studies and 
conduct. Five of these letters are still extant, and reveal 
the germs of the elaborate system that was afterward to 
bearthename of Herbart. The youthful pedagogueseems 
to have recognized the individual variations in children, 
and to have shown a due regard for the respective ages 
of his pupils, who were eight, ten, and fourteen years old. 
He also sought, by means of his beloved Odyssey, to de- 
velop in them the elements of morality and a ‘many- 
sided interest.’ This early experience, rather than his
-P-A-G-E-213
DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL PRACTICE 195 
ingenious system of psychology and metaphysics, which 
he afterward developed in explanation, was the real 
foundation of his pedagogy, and furnished him with the 
concrete examples of the characteristics and individ- 
ualities of children that appear in all his later works. He 
ever afterward maintained that a careful study of the de- 
velopment of a few children was the best preparation 
for a pedagogical career, and eventually made an expe- 
rience of this kind the main element in his training of 
teachers, 
While still in Switzerland, Herbart met Pestalozzi and 
was greatly attracted by the underlying principles of 
that reformer. He paid a visit to the institute at Burg- 
dorf in 1799, and during the next two years, while at 
Bremen completing his interrupted university course, he 
undertook to advocate and render more scientific the 
thought of the Swiss educator. It was at this time that 
Herbart wrote a sympathetic essay On Pestalozzi’s Latest 
Writing, ‘How Gertrude Teaches Her Children,’ and made 
his interpretation of Pestalozzi’s Idea of an A BC of Ob- 
servation. In the former work, Herbart describes what 
he saw at Burgdorf and defends some of the methods, 
which had been severely criticized. He also suggests 
supplementing the observational work of Pestalozzi with 
a study of triangles. He carries this idea further in the 
latter treatise, and attempts, as a result of his mathe- 
matical bent, to found the methods of Pestalozzi upon a 
definite theory of mechanics. While in Bremen also he 
made public addresses in which he tried to explain and 
expand the Pestalozzian practice. 
The Moral Revelation of the World and The Science 
of Education.—Following this period, from 1802 to 1809, but a practi- 
cal experience 
as a private 
tutor was the 
real founda 
tion of his 
pedagogy.

Pestalozzi at

tion of the 
World and his 
work on The

Herbart lectured ! on pedagogy at the University of Got- 
tingen. While here, among other pedagogical works, he 
formulated his final position On the Point of View in Judg- 
ing the Pestalozzian Method of Instruction, and published 
his ideas On the Moral Revelation of the World as the Chief 
Function of Education.? By this time he seems to have 
largely crystallized his own system. Pestalozzi had by 
his later works made evident the faults in his methods, 
and Herbart no longer strives to conceal their vagueness 
and want of system. In both of the Géttingen treatises 
he further insists upon ‘educative instruction,’ or real 
ethical training. Sense perception, he holds with Pesta- 
lozzi, does supply the first elements of knowledge, but the 
material of the school course should be arranged with 
reference to the general purpose of instruction, which is 
moral self-realization.? His position on the moral aim of 
education was made even more explicit in his standard, 
though deeply metaphysical, work on The Science of Ed- 
ucation,® which he produced shortly afterward (1806). 
His Seminary and Practice School at Kénigsberg.— 
In 1809 Herbart was called to the chair of philosophy at

not receive a regular salary, but is given a percentage of the fees of the 
students attending his lectures.

hung. With Herbart, the essence of the moral judgment is ‘zsthetic’ 
at bottom, and is entirely without proof. It deals with such relations 
among volitions as please or displease. This work was originally intended 
as an appendix to the second edition of his Pestalozsi’s Idea of an A BC 
of Observation, but it proved to be a forerunner of The Science of 
Education. It contains in outline all the positions systematically devel- 
oped in the more elaborate treatise.

theory and practice. He soon established his now his-

connected with it. This constituted the first attempt at 
experimentation and a scientific study of education on 
the basis now generally employed in universities. The 
students, who taught in the practice school under the 
supervision and criticism of the professor, were intending 
to become school principals and inspectors, and, through 
the widespread work and influence of these young Her- 
bartians, the educational system of Prussia and of every 
other state in Germany was greatly advanced. In his 
numerous publications at Kénigsberg, Herbart devoted 
himself chiefly to works on a system of psychology as a 
basis for his pedagogy, but he also wrote a number of 
minor essays and letters upon education. 
The Matured System in His Outlines of Educational 
Doctrine.—The conservatism and opposition to free in- 
quiry in Prussia, however, eventually became too re- 
strictive for a man of Herbart’s progressive temperament. 
After serving nearly a quarter of a century in Kénigsberg, 
he accepted a call to a professorship. of philosophy at 
Gottingen and the last eight years of his life were spent 
in expanding his pedagogical positions and lecturing with 
great approval at his old station. Here, in 1835, he 
issued the first edition of his Ouilines of Educational Doc-

tional system when fully matured. It contains brief 
references to his mechanical metaphysics and psychology,

but is as practical, sensible, and well organized a dis 
cussion of the educational process as has ever been pub- 
lished. The work proved to be his swan’s song, for, 
shortly after the new edition appeared, Herbart died at 
the height of his reputation. 
Herbart’s ‘Ideas’ and ‘ Apperception Masses.’— 
Herbart’s metaphysical psychology grew out of his 
interest in philosophy, and was probably an after- 
thought to his educational doctrines. It seems to have 
been largely developed to afford a scientific basis for 
the method of pedagogical procedure that he had worked 
out of his experience as a tutor and his acquaintance with 
the Pestalozzian practice. But some explanation of his 
elaborate psychology may serve to make clearer his 
educational principles. With the possible exception of 
Kant’s educational theories, Herbart’s was the first real 
system of education that was related to a psychology 
invented by the founder. His psychological positions 
have now been almost entirely abandoned or recon- 
structed, but the idea of justifying educational practice 
through an appeal to some system of psychology, and 
as a logical deduction from the laws of development in 
the child’s mind, has been productive of a marked ad- 
vance in pedagogy. Herbart’s system of psychology 
was largely an outgrowth of his own introspection. For 
the most part he holds that the mind is built up by the 
outside world, and he is generally supposed to have left 
no place for instincts or innate characteristics and 
tendencies! With him the simplest elements of con- 
1Yn this, however, both the devotees of Herbart, such as De Garmo 
was, or those more critical, like Adams, have overlooked the ‘empirical’ 
part of his Psychology and the whole of his Applications of Psychology.

sciousness are ‘presentations,’ or ideas, which result 
from the varying states into which the soul is thrown in 
endeavoring to maintain itself against external stimuli. 
They are atoms of mind stuff thrown off from the soul 
as the product of its contact with environment. 
The main function of the soul is thus to become the 
parent of ideas, and the mind, which is simply the ag- 
gregate of the ideas, is gradually constructed by this 
‘psychological mechanism.’ Once produced, the ideas 
become existences with their own dynamic force, and con- 
stantly strive to preserve themselves. They struggle to 
attain as nearly as possible to the summit of conscious- 
ness, and each idea tends to draw into consciousness or 
heighten those allied to it, and to depress or force out 
those which are unlike. Hence in the constant interaction 
between ideas present at the same time in consciousness, 
‘similar’ ideas fuse or combine into a homogeneous whole, 
and become more powerful in resisting all efforts to drive 
them out of consciousness; ‘disparate’ ideas, or those 
which cannot be compared, also combine, but form a com- 
plex or group rather than an indistinguishable unity; 
while ‘contrary,’ or hostile, ideas produce actual opposi- 
tion, and each attempts to drive the other out of con- 
sciousness. For example, ‘sweetness’ and ‘whiteness’ 
would be ‘disparate’ ideas, since they are not of the same 
In these works he leaves as much room for the innate as could be asked, 
for he admits that the ‘psychological mechanism’ never works itself out 
completely. In the body, which is somehow joined with the soul, are 
innate predispositions, which may retard or stimulate the ideas, and 
“the psychological mechanism is thus interfered with in characteristic 
fashion.” W. H. Kilpatrick of Columbia University has probably been 
the first to point out Herbart’s position in this matter.

class and might co-exist in our idea of an object, but 
‘whiteness’ and ‘blackness’ are so ‘contrary’ that one 
would necessarily contradict and drive the other out. 
Each new idea or group of ideas is, therefore, retained, 
modified, or rejected, according to its degree of harmony 
or conflict with the previously existing ideas.1 In other 
words, all new ideas are interpreted through those al- 
ready in consciousness. 
This principle, which Herbart called apperception, is 
the central doctrine in his whole educational system, and 
- he-works it out mathematically ? and constantly returns 
to it from many different angles. In accordance with ‘ap- 
perception’ the teacher can hope to secure interest and 
the attention of the pupil to any new idea or set of ideas 
and have him retain it, only through making use of his 
‘body of ‘related knowledge. The educational problem 
thus becomes how to present new material in such a way 
that it can be ‘apperceived’ or incorporated with the old. 
Hence, too, the mind of the pupil, which is thus prac- 
- tically built up by environment, must be largely in the 
hands of the teacher, since he can make or modify his 
‘apperception masses,’ or systems of ideas. 
The Moral and Religious Aim of Education.—In 
keeping with this control of the pupil’s destiny by his 
instructors, Herbart holds that the aim of education 
should be to establish the moral life or character. His 
Outlines opens with the statement:

and develops a complete mechanics of ideas. On the analogy of psychical 
tensions to physical forces, he works out a system of mental statics and 
dynamics that may be quantitatively determined.
-P-A-G-E-219
DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL PRACTICE 201 
“The term ‘virtue’ expresses the whole purpose of education. 
Virtue is the idea of ‘inner freedom,’ which has developed into an 
abiding actuality in an individual. Whence, as inner freedom is a 
relation between ‘insight’ and ‘volition,’ a double task is at once 
set before the teacher. It becomes his business to make actual 
each one of these factors separately, in order that later a perma- 
nent relationship may result.” 
In other words, virtue is attained by the pupil when 
his perception of what is right and wrong is in complete 
accord with his deeds,.agd the airn of education should, 
therefore, be to instil such ideas as will develop both his 
understanding of the moral order and a conscientious 
spirit in carrying it out. “To induce the pupil to make 
this effort,” Herbart admits, “is a difficult achievement. 
It is easy enough, by the study of the example of others, 
to cultivate theoretical acumen; the moral application 
to the pupil himself, however, can be successfully made. 
only in so far as his inclinations and habits have taken 
a direction in keeping with his insight.” To make clearer 
the meaning of this ‘inner freedom’ and the moral aim, 
Herbart formulates subsidiary ethical concepts, which, 
together with the main ideal, should from the first be 
incorporated into the pupil’s stock of ideas. But even 
the attainment of moral living is not sufficient. 
“It is necessary to combine moral education proper, which in 
everyday life lays stress continually on correct self-determination, 
with religious training. The notion that something really worthy 
has been achieved, needs to be tempered by humility. Conversely, 
religious education has need of the moral also to forestall cant and 
hypocrisy.” 2

“Many-sided Interest’ and the ‘Historical’? and 
‘ Scientific’ Studies ——The making of the morally reli- 
gious man is, therefore, Herbart’s idea of the end of 
education. His ultimate aim must, however, be attained 
through instruction, and since that medium has to deal 
with the human mind, the more immediate purpose must 
be based upon psychology, just as the final goal is depend- 
ent upon ethics. It is obvious to Herbart that existing 
instruction has not succeeded, because it is based upon a 
false theory. According to his psychology, he maintains 
that “what is customarily ascribed to the action of the 
various ‘faculties,’ takes place in certain groups of ideas.” 
The mind is not possessed of certain powers or forces, but 
consists merely of an aggregate of ideas. Hence he has no 
sympathy with any doctrine of ‘formal discipline.’ 
Even ‘will,’ upon which man’s character rests, is not 
to be regarded as an ‘independent faculty.’ . ‘Volition 
has its root in thought,” he claims, “not, indeed, in the 
details one knows, but certainly in the combination and 
total effect of the acquired ideas.” A careful study must, 
accordingly, be made of each pupil’s thought masses, 
temperament, and mental capacity and processes, to 
determine how instruction may furnish a ‘moral revela- 
tion of the world.’ In Herbart’s judgment: 
“Instruction in the sense of mere information-giving contains 
no guarantee whatever that it will materially counteract faults 
and influence existing groups of ideas that are independent of the 
imparted information. But it is these ideas that education must 
reach; for the kind and extent of assistance that instruction may 
render to conduct may depend upon the hold it has upon them.” ! 
There is not much likelihood of the pupil’s receiving 
10p. cit. p. 23.
-P-A-G-E-221
DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL PRACTICE 203 
ideas of virtue that will develop into glowing ideals of 
conduct when his studies do not appeal to his thought 
systems and are consequently regarded with indifference 
and aversion. They must coalesce with the ideas he 
already has, and thus touch his life; interest must be felt 
in order that will may be aroused. But Herbart does not 
limit ‘interest’ to a temporary stimulus for the perform- 
ance of certain school tasks; he advocates the building 
up by education of certain broad interests that may be- 
come permanent sources of appeal in life. Interest as 
an end or aim,—as a permanent product of education, 
should be paramount and the direct result of interest as a 
" means. Instruction must be so selected and arranged as 
not only to relate itself to the previous experience of the 
pupil, but as also to reveal and establish all the relations 
of life and conduct in their fullness. To expand the 
mental horizon and open every avenue of approach to 
his ideas, interests, and will, it is necessary that the pupil 
should be given as broad instruction as possible. In this 
* way only can a wide range of ideas be furnished and the 
necessary ‘ many-sided interest’ created. 
In analyzing the many-sided interest, Herbart further 
holds that ideas and interests spring from two main 
sources,—‘experience,’ which furnishes us with a knowl- 
edge of nature, and ‘social intercourse,’ from which 
come the sentiments toward our fellow men. Interests 
may, therefore, be classed as belonging to (1) ‘knowledge’ 
or to (2) ‘participation.’ These two sets of interests, in 
turn, Herbart divides into three groups each. He classes 
the ‘knowledge’ interests as (a) ‘empirical,’ appealing ; 
; directly to the senses; (b) ‘speculative,’ seeking to per- pation, 
ceive the relations of cause and effect; and (c) ‘esthetic,’ are divided There is 
needed a 
‘many-sided 
interest.’ 
This will in- 
clude inter- 
ests of (1) 
‘knowledge,’ 
which are 
divided into

  204 A HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
resting upon the enjoyment of contemplation. The ‘par- 
ticipation’ interests are divided into (a) ‘sympathetic,’ 
dealing with relations to other individuals; (b) ‘social,’ 
including the community as a whole; and (c) ‘religious,’ 
treating one’s relations to the Divine. After making this 
analysis of the six types of interest that are needed, he 
also dilates upon the dangers of one-sidedness in each 
case, and endeavors to “bring out more clearly the mani- 
fold phases of interest that must be taken into account.” 
For Herbart, then, just as religious morality is the final 
aim of education, the more immediate purpose of instruc- 
tion is ‘many-sided interest.’ “Instruction,” he de- 
clares, “will form the circle of thought, and education the 
~ character. The last is nothing without the first. Herein 
is contained the whole sum of my pedagogy.” 
Since character is thus to develop through the medium 
of instruction and the growth of concrete knowledge, which 
should be as broad as possible, the subject-matter of the 
curriculum should cover the entire range of known ideas. 
Hence, to correspond to the two main groups of interests, 
Herbart divides all studies into two main branches,—the 
(x) ‘historical,’ including history, literature, and lan- 
guages; and the (2) ‘scientific,’ embracing mathematics, 
as well as the natural sciences. Although recognizing the 
value of both main groups of interests and studies, Her- 
bart especially stressed the ‘historical,’ on the ground 
that history and literature are of greater importance as 
the sources of moral ideas and sentiment: “7”

conditions and relations in the foreground of instruction,
-P-A-G-E-223
  DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL PRACTICE 205 
This humanistic aim should underlie the study of the 
‘historical’ subjects, and only with reference to this aim 
may they be allowed to preponderate.” And elsewhere, 
when dealing with moral development through literature 
and history, he argues: 
“Give to children an interesting story, rich in incidents, relation- 
ships, characters, strictly in accordance with the psychological 
truth, and not beyond the feelings and ideas of children; make no 
effort to depict the worst or the best, only let a faint, half- 
unconscious moral tact secure that the interest of the action tends 
away from the bad towards the good, the just, the right; then you 
will see how the child’s attention is fixed upon it, how it seeks to 
discover the truth and thinks over all sides of the matter, how the 
many-sided material calls forth a many-sided judgment, how the 
charm of changeendsin preference for the best, so that the boy, who 
perhaps feels himself a step or two higher in moral judgment than 
the hero or the author, will cling to his view with inner approbation, 
ped so guard himself from a coarseness he already feels beneath 
The best starting-point and source of material for this 
moral training through the ‘historical’ subjects, Herbart, 
with his ‘new humanistic’ devotion to Greek literature, 
felt was to be found in Homer’s Odyssey. He was ‘chiefly 
interested in the work of the secondary school, but his 
principles were applied especially to elementary educa- 
tion by his followers. Herbart has in this way greatly 
influenced both stages of education in the teaching of 
history and literature for moral training, and has effected 
a great improvement in the methods of teaching these 
subjects. .

ies have for convenience been separated and classified 
‘.. by themselves, they must be so arranged i in the curricu- 
lum as to become unified and an organic whole, if the 
unity of the pupil’s consciousness is to be maintained. 
Concerning this, Herbart holds:— 
“Scattering no less than one-sidedness forms an antithesis to 
many-sidedness. Many-sidedness is to be the basis of virtue; but 
. the latter is.an attribute of personality, hence it is evident that the 
unity of self-consciousness must not be impaired. The business of 
instruction is to form the person on many sides, and accordingly 
to avoid a distracting or dissipating effect. And instruction has 
successfully avoided this in the case of one who with ease surveys 
his well-arranged knowledge in all of its unifying relations and 
holds it together as his very own.” 1 
This position of Herbart forecasts the emphasis upon 
correlation, or the unification of studies, so common 
among his followers. The principle was further developed 
by later Herbartians under the name of concentration, or 
epochstheory,” the unifying of all subjects around one or two common 
central studies, such as literature or history. But the 
selection and articulation of the subject-matter in such a 
way as to arouse many-sidedness and harmony is not 
more than hinted at by Herbart himself. He specifically 
holds, however, that the Odyssey should be the first work 
read, since this represents the interests and activities of 
the race while in its youth, and would appeal to th: 
dividual during the same stage. He would follow 
epic with the Iliad, the Philoctetes of Sophocles, the bis- 
tories of Xenophon, Plato’s dialogues, and othe ~

depicted in them.1 This tentative endeavor of Herbart, 
in the selection of material for the course of study, to 
parallel the development of the individual with that of 
the race, was continued and enlarged by his disciples. It 
especially became definite and fixed in the culture epochs 
theory formulated by Ziller and others.? 
The ‘Formal Steps of Instruction.’—But to secure 
this broad range of material and to unify and systematize 
it, Herbart realized that it was necessary to formulate a 
method of instructing the child. Due sequence and order 
must be introduced to shape the material into a well- 
arranged structure. This plan of instruction he wished 
to conform to the development and working of the human 
mind, and in this connection introduced his distinction 
between absorption and reflection.® This twofold mental 
Process is necessary in grasping all new knowledge, and 
the alternation between the two steps has sometimes been 
described as the ‘breathing’ of the mind. ‘Absorption’ is 
giving oneself up to acquisition or contemplation of facts 
or ideas, and ‘reflection’ is the unification or assimilation 
of the manifold knowledge gained by absorption. As 
these two stages are mutually exclusive, the pupil passes 
in psychical development from one to the other. On the 
basis of this description of mental activity and growth, 
Herbart worked out the outlines of his logical method in 
instruction, which he states as follows:— 
“We prescribe the general rule: give equal prominence to ab- 
sorption and reflection in every group of objects, even the smallest; 
1Herbart’s attitude’on the development of interests in the race is 
most fully brought out in his Science of Education, Introduction and 
Chapter V, 1.

that is to say, emphasize equally clearness of the individual per- 
ception, association of the manifold, coérdination of the associated, 
and progress through exercise according to this codrdination.” 
Of the four steps indicated in this method, (1) clear- 
ness, the presentation of facts or elements to be learned, 
is purely ‘absorption’; (2) association, the uniting of these 
with related facts previously acquired, is mainly ‘ absorp-

tive analyses and interpretations of the mechanics of 
instruction. 
The Value and Influence of Herbart’s Principles.— 
On all sides, then, as compared with Pestalozzi, Herbart 
was most logical and comprehensive. Where Pestalozzi i 
obtained his methods from a sympathetic insight into 
the child mind, Herbart sought to found his upon scien- 
tific principles. The former was primarily a philanthro- 
pist and reformer; the latter a psychologist and scientific 
educationalist. Pestalozzi succeeded in arousing Europe 
to the need of universal education and of vitalizing the 
prevailing formalism in the schools, but he was unable 
with his vague and unsystematic utterances to give guid- 
ance and efficiency to the reform forces he had initiated. 
While he felt the need of ‘psychologizing instruction’ and 
of beginning with sense perception for the sake of clear 
ideas, he had neither the time nor the training to con-- 
struct a psychology beyond the traditional one of the 
times, nor to analyze the way in which the material 
gained by observation is assimilated. Herbart, on the 
other hand, did create a system of psychology that, al- 
though subsequent to, and possibly not altogether con- 
sistent with, his educational practice, had an immediate 
bearing upon it. While his psychological system is fanci- 
ful and mechanical, and applies better as an explanation 
of the process of instruction than as a description of hu- 
man thought, it largely started the fruitful research in 
psycho-physics of modern times, and has worked well as 
a basis for educational theory and practice. Moreover, 
it undertook to show how ideas, which were the prod- 
uct of the Pestalozzian ‘observation,’ were assimilated 
through ‘apperception,’ and maintained the possibility of sense perceD-

of the successive steps in all instruction, and by his

and system into the work of the classroom: 
hie Ber On the other hand, a great drawback to the Herbartian 
ciples have doctrines is found in their formalization and exaggera- 
tended io tion. For these tendencies his enthusiastic and literal- 
alization oa minded followers, rather than Herbart himself, have 
in the hands probably been to blame. No man has suffered more from 
of tis d& the elaborations and interpretations of dogmatic dis¢i-

a a psychology that takes no account of heredity or the 
‘ AR innate characteristics of each mind, but holds that the 
4 mind is entirely built up by impressions from the outside 
and is merely a product of environment. While thisis the 
position, at which he arrives by pure speculation in his 
‘rational’ psychology, he recognizes in his ‘empirical’ 
   
-P-A-G-E-229

psychology that there must be certain native predisposi- 
tions in the body which influence the soul in one direction 
or another.) This limitation of complete plasticity by . 
the pupil’s individuality, and of the consequent influence 
of the teacher, is also admitted in his educational doc- 
trine, and he declares that, “in order to gain an adequate 
knowledge of each pupil’s capacity for education, obser- 
vation is necessary—observation both of his thought 
masses and of his physical nature. The study of the lat- 
ter includes that of temperament, especially with refer- - 
ence to emotional susceptibility.” * Again, while Herbart 
holds that every subject should, if possible, be presented 
in an attractive, interesting, and ‘almost playlike’ way, 
he does not justify that ‘sugar-coated interest’ which 
has so often put Herbartianism in bad odor. “A view 
that regards the end as a necessary evil to be rendered 
endurable by means of sweetmeats,” says he, “implies 
an utter confusion of ideas; and if pupils are not given 
serious tasks to perform, they will not find out what they 
are able to do.”® Often, he realizes, “even the best 
method cannot secure an adequate degree of apperceiv- 
ing attention from every pupil, and recourse must ac- 
cordingly be had to the voluntary attention; 7. e. to the 
pupil’s resolution.” Similarly, the notion of some Her- 
bartians that the goal of teaching is attained with the 
securing of apperception and interest, and that effortful 
memorizing is never desirable, finds no sanction in the

fectly favorable condition.” + Again, ‘correlation’ be- 
tween different subjects, as well as between principles 
within the same subject, was advocated by Herbart, but 
he felt that such ramifications should not be unlimited, 
and held it “an error to argue that one who is being ini- 
tiated into one subject ought to combine with that subject 
a second, third, or fourth, on the ground that subjects 
one, two, three, and four are essentially interrelated.” ? 
Further, while Herbart made some effort in shaping the 
course of study to parallel the development of the indi- 
vidual with that of the race, it was Ziller that erected this 
procedure into a hard and fast theory of ‘culture epochs.’ 
But most common of all has been the tendency of his dis- 
ciples to pervert the attempt of Herbart to bring about 
due sequence and arrangement into an inflexible schema 
in the recitation, and to make the formal steps an end 
rather than a means. ‘These steps may be used to enable 
the novice in teaching to prepare himself for class work 
by arranging the materials he wishes to present after an 
organized plan, but they do not represent definite fixed 
stages that must be followed without exception in 
every recitation, nor do they correspond to the steps 
taken in the inductive method of science or logical rea- 
soning in general, as has sometimes been supposed. 
Moreover, there is reason to believe that Herbart did not 
intend that all these steps should be carried out in every 
recitation, but felt that they applied to the organization 
of any subject as a whole, and that years might even 
elapse between the various steps.* In this respect, as in

the others, the doctrines of Herbart should not be con- 
fused with the wooden interpretations of certain Her- 
bartians. 
The Extension of His Doctrines through Disciples in 
Germany.—Thus the theoretical foundations of Her- 
bart were laid mostly in outline, but some of his disciples 
undertook to fill in, extend, and somewhat crystallize his 
ideas. They reduced his theories to practice and applied 
them to the content and methods of the elementary and 
secondary systems of Germany. At first the doctrines of 
Herbart were little known, but a quarter of a century 
after his death there sprang up two flourishing contem- 
porary schools of Herbartianism. In its application of 
Herbart’s theory, the school of Stoy for the most part 
held closely to the original form; but that headed by Zil- 
ler gave it a freer and more extreme interpretation, and 
contributed several important modifications and elabo- 
rations to the theories. Tuiskon Ziller (1817-1883), 
both as teacher in a gymnasium and as professor at Leip- 
zig, did much to popularize and develop the Herbartian 
system. His great work, The Basis of the Doctrine of Ed- 
ucative Instruction, which was published in 1865, brought 
Herbartianism into prominence, and resulted in the for- 
mation of the society known as the ‘Association for the 
Scientific Study of Education,’ which has since spread 
throughout Germany. Ziller further emphasized Her- 
bart’s division of the curriculum into two groups of stud- 
ies, and made clear the subordination of the ‘scientific’ 
studies to the ‘historical.’ He also elaborated the doc- 
trines of ‘correlation’ and ‘concentration,’ and was the 
first definitely to formulate the ‘culture epochs’ theory. 
“Every pupil should,’ said he, “pass successively A quarter of a 
century after 
Herbart’s 
death, his 
system was

through each of the chief epochs of the general mental 
development of mankind suitable to his stage of develop- 
ment. The material of instruction, therefore, should be 
drawn from the thought material of that stage of histor- 
ical development in culture, which runs parallel with the 
present mental stage of the pupil.” This theory of cul- 
ture epochs, like the biological theory of ‘recapitulation,’ 
of which it is a pedagogical application, is now admitted 
by most educators to be thoroughly inconsistent. While 
it has occasioned much academic discussion, few edu- 
cators, beside Ziller, have ventured to embody it com- 
pletely in a course of study. But Ziller worked out all 
his principles practically in a curriculum for the eight 
years of the elementary school, which he centered around 
fairy tales, Robinson Crusoe, and selections from the Old 
and New Testaments. He, moreover, developed Herbart’s 
‘formal stages of instruction’ by dividing the first step 
and changing the name of the last.1 
Karl Volkmar Sioy (1815-1885), the founder of the 
other school, gave less attention than Ziller to the de- 
velopment of the Herbartian theories, and his numerous 
educational works were mainly a forceful restatement of 
the master’s positions. On the other hand, in 1874 he 
established a most influential pedagogical seminary and 
practice school upon the original Herbartian basis at 
Jena, where he had become a professor. And eleven 
years later, Wilhelm Rein (1847- —_-), who had been a 
ginal pupil of both Stoy and Ziller, succeeded the former in the 
direction of the practice school, and introduced there the 
elaborate development that had taken place since Her- 
bart’s time. He adopted Ziller’s ‘concentration,’ ‘cul-

-P-A-G-E-233
DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL PRACTICE 215 
ture epochs,’ and other features, but made them a little 
more elastic by codrdinating other material with the 
‘historical’ center in the curriculum. Rein had pre- 
viously worked out a course of study for the eight years 
of the Volksschule (i. e. elementary school) in great 
detail, and, by his embodiment of this in the practice 
school, Jena became the great center of Herbartianism. 
Those studying the Herbartian methods there had 
each lesson illustrated through a visit-to a class, fol- 
lowed by a thorough discussion of the principles and 
problems involved therein. Most of the prominent 
Herbartians in other countries, especially the United 
States, obtained their first interest through a residence 
at Jena. 
Other Germans to influence Herbartianism have been 
Lange and Frick. The Apperception of Karl Lange is an 
excellent combination of scientific insight and popular 
presentation. It treats the various problems of education 
on the basis that “‘all learning is apperceiving.” Lange 
agrees in general with the Herbartian method, but warns 
againstits possible mechanics and formalism. Otto Frick, 
director of the ‘Francke Institutions’ at Halle,’ inclining 
more to the close interpretation of Stoy, devoted him- 
self to applying Herbartianism to the secondary schools. 
An organic course for the ‘gymnasium’ (i. ¢. the classical 
secondary school) was outlined in the eighth number of 
the Quarterly Magazine, which he edited. A throng of 
other German schoolmasters and professors have further 
adapted the doctrines of Herbart to school practice, 
and while their theories differ very largely from one

land of its birth, the United States has been more infly- 
enced by Herbartianism than any other country. The 
movement was fostered largely by American teachers 
who had taken the doctor’s degree at Jena during the 
late eighties, and during the last decade of the nineteenth 
century it attained almost to the proportions of a cult, 
The movement centered chiefly in northern Tlinois, and 
was especially strong in the normal schools. Much of the 
organization of the practice school at Jena was adopted 
with practically no modification in a large number of 
American normal schools. In 1892 ‘The National Her- 
bart Society’ was founded to extend the scope of these 
principles and to adapt them to American conditions, and 
included many prominent educators in its membership. 
The association started immediately to translate the 
works of Herbart and various German Herbartians, and 
since 1895 it has regularly published a Year Book. In 
this journal, during the first years of the society, it repro- 
duced its discussions concerning apperception, interest, 
correlation, educative instruction, and other purely Her- 
bartian themes. Besides these efforts, individual mem- 
bers of the organization have been active in discussing 
Herbartian principles and-their embodiment in American 
methods of instruction. Charles DeGarmo, for sixteen 
years professor of Education at Cornell University, as 
early as 1889 published The Essentials of Method, which 
embodied the Herbartian theories, and gave them a wide 
popularity. He became the first president of the Herbart 
Society and editor of its publications, and has utilized 
Herbartian principles as the basis of a number of excel- 
- lent text-books. Charles A. McMurry of the Illinois 
State Normal University, and his brother, Frank M. In the United 
States Her- 
bartianism 
was developed 
during the 
nineties by 
‘The Na- 
tional Her- 
bart Society,’

members of 
the society, 
like DeGarmo 
and the

also made im-

tributions.

218 A HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
McMurry of the Columbia Teachers College, both by 
books and articles, have done yeoman service for Her- 
bartianism. In 1897 they published jointly The Method 
of the Recitation. Five years before Charles McMurry 
had brought out a General Method, and since then he has 
produced a number of works on special method, covering 
most subjects of the elementary curriculum. 
Moreover, many who would hardly consider them- 
selves Herbartians have undertaken to modify and adapt 
these principles, especially correlation and concentration. 
Francis W. Parker of Chicago, among the phases of his 
educational practice, approached Ziller’s principle of con- 
centration so closely as to center the entire course of 
study around a hierarchy of natural and social sciences. 
But, as a rule, the more moderate type of correlation sug- 
gested by Herbart himself has been used, and such inter- 
relations as those between arithmetic and manual train- 
ing, history and literature, and geography and history 
have been developed by many educators. A correlation 
even of science and history was attempted by the late 
Wilbur S. Jackman, Colonel Parker’s associate. The 
Committee of Fifteen, appointed by the National Educa- 
tion Association to report upon elementary education, 
show a strong Herbartian influence in their discussions 
of correlation, although they give the term a wider inter- 
pretation. Various other types of unification about a 
center of literature, history, or nature study, or, through 
combination with Froebelianism, of social activities, have 
been suggested. 
: Largely as a result of the development of Herbartian- 
ism, a reform in the content of the curriculum has also be- 
reforms come general in American elementary schools. This is
-P-A-G-E-237
DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL PRACTICE 219 
especially noticeable in the increased amount and larger 
utilization of historical material. Beside the Herbartian, 
other factors were probably responsible for this develop- 
ment, but the work of the disciples of Rein undoubtedly 
played a leading part in encouraging a broader concep- 
tion of the function of history. A wide appreciation of 
the growth of morality, culture, and social life in general, 
rather than merely the development of patriotism, be- 
came the object in studying this subject. English and 
German history, as well as the American, which alone 
was formerly taught, and sometimes Greck, Roman, and 
Norse, appear in the curricula of many elementary 
schools, and, instead of being confined to the two upper 
classes, historical material is often presented from the 
third grade up. Biographical and historical stories are through the 
Herbartian 
movement.

some attempt is made to use European history as a set- 
ting for American, and throughout there is made as broad 
a study of social conditions as possible, rather than a 
mere account of wars and political changes. A similar 
development in the amount and use of literature also ap- 
pears in the course of the elementary schools as a result 
of the Herbartian influence. Instead of brief selections # 
from the best English and American writers, or even the 
poorer material that formerly appeared in the school 
readers, complete works of literature have begun to be 
studied in the elementary curriculum, and a wide and : 
rapid survey of the great English classics has been en- 
couraged in the place of merely reading for the sake of 
oral expression. Even in the lowest grades some attempt 
to introduce the classics of childhood has been made.

most unknown in the United States, no other s

thought and practice of teachers generally. 
==> Froebel’s Early Life—Let us now turn to Froebel, Z 
velopment and extension of the master’s 
‘natural development.’ Friedrich Wilhelm 
Froebel’s reli- bel (1782-1852) was born in Oberweissbach

ite hed religious, but, owing to the predccupation

institution was charged with the idealistic philosophy, 
the romantic movement, and the evolutionary attitude in 
science. Froebel could not have escaped the discussions 
upon Fichtian philosophy, which were current upon the 
street, at the table, and in every informal place of meet- 
ing, and he must have witnessed the academic growth of 
Fichte’s pupil and colleague, Schelling. He must like- 
wise have fallen under the spell of the Jena romanti- 
cists—the Schlegels, Tieck, and Novalis, and possibly 
even of their friends and protectors, Goethe and Schiller. 
The advanced attitude in science at Jena may also have 
impressed the youth. While much of the science instruc- 
tion failed to make clear that inner relation and mystic 
unity for which he sought, he must occasionally have 
caught glimpses of it in the lectures of the professors. Un- 
happily, after a couple of years, all this enchanted world 
was closed to him through financial difficulties, and he 
was forced -to return home. 
His Adoption of Teaching, and the Crystallization of 
His Law of ‘ Unity..—For the next four years, Froebel 
was wandering and groping for a niche in wre Even- 
tually, in 1805, while beginning the study of architecture 
in Frankfort, he met Anton Griiner, head of a Pesta- 
lozzian model school, who persuaded him of his fitness for 
teaching and gave him a position in the institution. Here 
he undertook a systematic study of Pestalozzianism under 
the guidance of Griiner, and began to develop his own prin- 
ciples and methods. Through the use of modeling in pa- 
per, pasteboard, and wood with some private pupils, he 
came to see the value of motor expression as a means of 
education.) After three years in Frankfort he withdrew 
to study and practice at Yverdon. The two years he romanticism,

about physi-

ied at the 
University of 
Berlin and 
crystallized 
his mystic 
law of ‘unity.’ 
In 1816, with 
Langethal 
and Midden- 222 A HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
spent there proved most profitable. He gained much 
from the training in physiography and nature study that 
he gave the pupils during long walks in the country; he 
found an opportunity to study the play of children in its 
effect upon intellectual as well as physical developmeht; 
he first came to attach importance to that earliest train- 
ing of a child by its mother; and his knowledge of music, 
which was to play so important a part in his methods, 
was greatly enlarged. As a further result of his stay in 
Yverdon, Froebel began to see more than ever the need 
of a broader training, if he were going to unify education, 
and as soon as possible he gave up his work in Frankfort, 
and renewed his university studies. He went first to Gét- 
tingen in 1811, but was the next year attracted to Berlin 
by the reputation of Professor Weiss in mineralogy. 
While with Weiss, he became fully “convinced of the de- 
monstrable connection in all cosmic development,” and 
declared that ‘thereafter my rocks and crystals served 
me as a mirror wherein I might discern mankind, and 
man’s development and history.” Thus he crystallized 
that mystic law of ‘unity’ with which he had long been 
struggling. 
The School at Keilhau and the Education of Man.— 
Except for a year of service in the Prussian army, where 
he met his enthusiastic young friends and lifelong as- 
sistants, Langethal and Middendorf, Froebel remained at 
Berlin for four studious years. But he never lost sight 
of his original purpose of educational reform. While at 
~ the university he continued his study of child nature by 
teaching in the Pestalozzian school of Plamann,' and, in 
1816, he yndertook the education of five young nephews, 
1See footnote 1 on p. 146.
-P-A-G-E-241
DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL PRACTICE 223 
with the hope of working out his pedagogical theories. 
In this venture he was soon joined by Middendorf and 
Langethal, and with them he founded ‘The Universal 
German Institute of Education’ at the Thiiringian vil- 
lage of Keilhau. The education there aimed to develop 
the pupils harmoniously in all their powers through the 
exercise of their own activity in subjects whose relations 
with one another and with life had been carefully thought 
out. Self-expression, free development, and social par- 
ticipation were the ruling principles of the school. Much 
of the training was obtained through play, and, except 
that the pupils were older, the germ of the kindergarten 
was already present. There was much practical work in 
the open air, in the garden about the schoolhouse, and in 
the building itself. The children built dams and mills, 
fortresses and castles, and searched the woods for ani- 
mals, birds, insects, and flowers. They learned to work 
out practical problems in form and number, and had the 
world of imagination opened to them through romances, 
ballads, and war-songs. 
To-popiilarize the institute, Froebel published in 1826 andh 
a complete account of the theory practiced at Keilhau in 
his famous Education of Man. While this work is com- § 
pressed, repetitious, and vague, and its doctrines had af- 
terward to be corrected by experience, it contains the 
most systematic statement of his educational philosophy 
that Froebel ever made. It describes Froebel’s interpre- 
tation of the universe and the consequent meaning of 
human life, makes an exposition of his chief principles 
of education, and applies them to the various stages 
of life and to the chief school subjects. But the times 
were not ripe for the radical educational methods There he

pupils to self-

practiced in the community at Keilhau. The in- 
stitute was suspected of socialistic tendencies, and the 
government inspector of schools was ordered to in- 
vestigate. This official, however, reported that he “found 
here a closely united family of some.sixty members held 
together in mutual confidence and every member seeking 
the good of the whole. . . . That this union must have 
the most salutary influence on instruction and training 
and on the pupils themselves, is self-evident... . No 
slumbering power remains unawakened; each finds the 
stimulus it needs in so large a family... . The aim of 
the institution is by no means knowledge and science _ 
merely, but free self-active development of the mind

reasons Froe. 4 Development of the Kindergarten and Froebel’s Later

ucational importance of play now appealed to him more 
strongly than ever. He began to study and devise play- 
things, games, songs, and bodily movements that would 
be of value in the development of small children, although 
at first he did not organize his materials into a system. 
Then, two years later, when his wife’s failing health com- 
pelled him to return to Germany, he actually established 
a school for children between the ages of three and seven. 
This institution was located at Blankenburg, two miles 
from Keilhau, in one of the most romantic spots in the 
Thiiringian Forest, and was before long appropriately 
christened ‘Kindergarten.’! Here he put into use the 
material he had invented in Switzerland, added new de- 
vices, and developed his system. The main features of 
this were the ‘play songs’ for mother and child; the series 
of six ‘gifts,’ consisting of the sphere, cube, and other 
geometrical forms; and the ‘occupations,’ which applied 
to different constructions the principles the child had 
learned through the ‘gifts.’ During his seven years in 
Blankenburg, he constantly expanded his principles and 
added new material, and the accounts of these additions 
have been collected in the works known generally as Peda- 
gogics of the Kindergarten and Education by Development. 
By 1843 he had also enlarged his collection of songs into 
that attractive and popular book known as Mother Play 
and Nursery Songs. ‘This work was intended to illustrate 
concretely the principles and methods suggested in the 
Education of Mc an. 
1 That is to say, a ‘garden’ in which ‘children’ are the unfolding plants. 
Froebel at first called the institution by the cumbersome and uneupho- 
nious name of Kleinkinderbeschafligungsanstalt or Anstalt fiir Kleinkinder- 
pflege, and the term Kindergarten came to him like an inspiration one 
day while walking in the forest.

and married his favorite kindergartner.t. During this 
period Froebel obtained the friendship and support of

influences of his boyhood and possibly his early com- 
munion with nature,! combined with the idealistic philos- 
ophy, the romantic movement, and the scientific spirit 
of the day) These latter tendencies seem to have been 
assimilated by Froebel not only through his residence in 
Jena and Berlin, but through the influence of Langethal, 
Middendorf, and his first wife. {His conclusions as to 
educational theory and practice would have been pos- 
sible as inferences from a very different point of view, 
but as he developed them logically and consistently 
with his metaphysical position, it may be of value to 
consider briefly the groundwork of the Froebelian philos- 
ophy. This would seem the more important because at 
least one class of his present-day followers have deemed 
his philosophy absolutely essential to a proper under- 
standing of his practices. statement of 
them are the 
product of 
boyhood ex- 
periences, the 
idealism, the 
romanticism 
and the scien- 
tific thought 
of the times. 
From idealism Froebel probably took that interpreta- 
ion of the universe which holds to the unity of nature 
with the soul of man. The ‘Absolute,’ or God, he regarded 
as the self-conscious spirit from which originated both 
man and nature, and he consequently adopted an organic 
and unitary view of life? This was probably emphasized 
1It seems likely that Froebel has exaggerated the impressiori made on 
him by these boyhood experiences. Probably the chief influences in 
shaping his philosophy were those with which he came in contact at the 
University of Jena. 
2 Froebel is unconsciously following Schelling, when he talks of nature, 
symbolism, or esthetics; and Fichte, when he deals with will, duty, 
personality, and morality. Most striking is his resemblance to Schelling,

through the scientific thought of the times, in which ap- 
pear a feeling of unity and inner relation and a concep- 
tion of ordered evolution.’ Similarly, the weird religious 
experiences of his youth may have drawn him to the 
mysticism and symbolism of the current romanticism. 
Hence, while his writings are scientific in form, they ap- 
pear vague and sentimental, and are filled with an ex- 
treme symbolism. (His fundamental view of organic 
unity appears in his\general conception of the universe, 
and the Education of Man opens with the statement:— 
“Tn all things there lives and reigns an eternal law... . This 
Jaw has been and is enounced with equal clearness and distinctness 
in nature (the external), in the spirit (the internal), and in life, 
which unites the two. This all-controlling law is necessarily based 
on an all-pervading, energetic, living, self-conscious, and hence 
eternal Unity. ... This Unity is God. All things have come 
from the Divine Unity, from God, and have their origin in the 
Divine Unity, in God alone. All things live and have their being in 
and through the Divine Unity, in and through God. The divine 
effluence that lives in each thing is the essence of each thing.? 
This fundamental mystic conception Froebel con- 
stantly reiterates in various forms, and from it derives a 
number of educational ideals. But as these subsidiary 
especially as he seems to have borrowed some of his phraseology from 
the pupil of Schelling, his friend Krause. 
1 See pp. 220f. One of the science lecturers at Jena seems to have had 
some idea, of the “interrelations of all animals” and to have foreshadowed 
Darwinism in his conception of man as “but a more developed type 
which all the lower forms are striving to realize.” Judging from the 
strong similarity of Froebel’s works in thought and diction to those of 
Oken, it may well be that the school of Naturphilosophie was more 
influential than either idealism or romanticism in shaping his point of 
view. An unpublished paper by W. H. Kilpatrick of Columbia Univer- 
sity makes this relation very likely.

DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL PRACTICE 229 
conceptions do not play a prominent part in the actual 
practice of his system, it is sufficient to give them in 
outline only. As corollaries of the wity of man and na- 
ture, Froebel holds to continuity in creation and progres- 
sive development from the lower to the higher grades 
of being both in the history of the race and in the life 
of the individual. On the one hand, he holds, “God 
develops the most minute and imperfect elements, 
through ever-rising stages, according to a law eternally 
founded in itself”; on the other, “it is highly pernicious 
to consider the stages of human development—infant, 
child, boy or girl, man or woman—as really distinct, 
and not, as life shows them, as continuous in themselves 
in unbroken transitions.” In carrying out the former of 
these interpretations of ‘continuity,’ Froebel approaches 
the Herbartian theory of ‘culture epochs’ by holding 
that “‘each successive generation and each successive 
human being, inasmuch as he would understand the past 
and present, must pass through all preceding phases of 
human development and culture.” And the latter con- 
ception he elaborates into the declaration that ‘the 
vigorous complete development of each successive stage 
depends on the vigorous, complete, and characteristic 
development of each and all preceding stages of life,” 
and maintains that “‘the child, the boy, the man indeed 
should know no other endeavor but to be at every stage 
of development wholly what this stage calls for.” In 
this he would seem to revert from the general Pestaloz- 
zian principle of ‘development’ to the more fixed and 
set Rousselian theory of ‘delayed maturing.’+ Froebel 
likewise insists not only upon a ‘unity’ in age periods,

but at all periods upon a unity in intellectual, physical, 
and moral life, and in the relations of the mental phases 
of knowing, feeling, and willing. 
Moreover, he extends his principle of ‘unity’ to the 
subject-matter of the school, and maintains that there 
should be aconnectedness in the course of study. “Human 
education,” he declares, ‘‘requires the knowledge and ap- 
preciation of religion, nature, and language in their inti- 
mate living reciprocity and mutual interaction. Without 
the unity of the three, the school and we ourselves are lost 
in the fallacies of bottomless, self-provoking diversity.” 
He holds that this interrelation of studies should exist be- 
cause of their mutual dependence upon the divine efflu- 
ence. Nature study, for example, gives acquaintance 
with the handiwork and manifestation of God, mathe- 
matics makes clear the reign of law in the universe, and 
language must be connected with religious instruction, in 
order that words may be joined with real ideas in life. 
Furthermore, there should be a ‘connectedness’ between 
the home and school life, and the means of education 
should combine domestic and scholastic occupations. 
Hence, while these pedagogical conclusions are drawn 
from his mystic philosophy, they do not differ in spirit 
from the ‘correlation’ and ‘concentration’ based upon 
the Herbartian psychology. 
* Self-activity’ and ‘Creativeness.—But the most 
fruitful consequence of this law of ‘unity’ is Froebel’s 
inference as to the proper procedure in education. He 
holds: : 
“Tn every human being, as a member of humanity and as a child 
of God, there lies and lives humanity as a whole; but in each one 
it is realized and expressed in a wholly particular, peculiar, per-
-P-A-G-E-249
DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL PRACTICE 231 
sonal, and unique manner, and it should be exhibited in each in- 
dividual human being in this wholly peculiar, unique manner.” ! 
Hence he maintains that there is in every person 
at birth a coérdinated, unified plan of his mature char- 
acter, and that, if it is not marred or interfered with, 
it will develop naturally of itself. While he is not en- 
tirely consistent, and at times implies that this natural 
development must be guided and even shaped, in the 
main he reiterates Rousseau’s doctrine that ‘nature is 
right,’ and clearly stands for a full and free expression 
of the instincts and impulses. Moreover, since the nat- 
ural or unmarred impulses are in accord with this 
unique implicit character, and may be interfered with 
or thwarted by an unwise education, he insists that 
“education in instruction and training should necessarily 
be passive, following; not prescriptive, categorical, inter- 
fering,” * and thus presents Rousseau’s idea of ‘negative 
education’ with but slight disguise. / 
But in his conclusion as to the proper method for 
accomplishing this ‘development,’ Froebel naturally 
holds that it “should be brought about not in the way of 
dead imitation or mere copying, but in the way of living, 
spontaneous self-activity,”* for “the eternal divine 
principle as such demands and requires free self-activity 
and self-determination on the part of man, the being 
created for freedom in the image of God.” 4 And this 
principle of self-activity as the method of education is 
most distinctively Froebelian and has proved most im- 
portant and influential. By it Froebel implies more 
than niere activity. It is not simply activity in response

with which is

principle of 
‘creativeness’

pression. 
He also stres- 
ses the social 
aspects of 
  232 A HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
to suggestion or instruction from parents or teachers 
that he seeks, but activity of the child in carrying out 
his own impulses and decisions. Individuality must be 
developed by such activity, and selfhood given its right- 
ful place as the guide to the child’s powers when exer- 
cised in learning. It is not sufficient that the learner 
shall do all for himself, but the activity must enlist the 
entire self in all its phases of being. 
Froebel, therefore, advocates not only motor activity, 
but self-expression as the chief aim of educational 
method. Hence with this idea of development through 
‘self-activity’ is connected his principle of creativeness, 
by which new forms and combinations are made and 
expression is given to new images and ideas.) Here also 
he at first gives his theory a mystic garb and states it in 
religious language. He declares that ‘“‘since God created 
man in his own image, man should create and bring forth 
like God; this is the high meaning, the deep significance, 
the great purpose of work and industry, of productive 
and creative activity.”1 But when he comes to deal 
with constructive handwork in the school, like Rousseau 
he bases his position upon psychological grounds and 
says:— 
ke To learn a thing in life and through doing is much more devel- 
oping, cultivating, and strengthening, than to learn it merely 
through the verbal communication of ideas. Similarly, plastic 
material representation in life and through doing, united with 
thought and speech, is by far more developing and cultivating than 
the merely verbal representation of ideas.” 2

upon this psychological principle of motor expression

-P-A-G-E-251
DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL PRACTICE 233 
under the head of ‘self-activity’ and ‘creativeness’ is 
the chief characteristic of Froebel’s method. Rousseau 
had recommended motor activity as a means of learning, # 
but he had insisted upon an isolated and unsocial educa- ai 
tion for Emile. Froebel, however, stresses the social 
aspects of education quite as clearly as he does the prin- 
ciple of self-expression, and seems to hold that the one 
is essential to the other. (The increasing self-realization, 
or individualization through ‘self-activity,’ must come 
through a process of socialization, The life of the in- 
dividual is necessarily bound up with participation in 
institutional life. Each one of the various human insti- 
tutions in which the mentality of the race has manifested 
itsel{—the home, the school, the church, the state, and 
society at large—becomes a medium for the activity of 
the individual, and at the same time a means of social 
control. The social instinct is primal, and the individual 
can be truly educated only in the company of other 
human beings. ) 
Hence, Froebel held that in education ‘self-activity’ 
should be used to enable the child to enter into the life 
about him and to find the connection between himself and 
the activities of others. As far as he enters into the sur- 
rounding life, he is to receive the development needed for 
the present, and thereby also to be prepared for the fu- 
ture. Through imitation of codperative activities in play, 
he obtains not only physical, but intellectual and moral 
training. Hence Froebel rhetorically asks: 
“Justice, moderation, self-control, truthfulness, loyalty, broth- 
erly love, and again, strict impartiality--who, when he approaches 
a group of boys engaged in such games, could:fail to catch the fra- 
grance of these delicious blossomings of the heart and mind, and education, 
and holds that

of a firm will; not to mention the beautiful, though perhaps less 
fragrant, blossoms of courage, perseverance, resolution, prudence, 
together with the severe elimination of indolent indulgence?” * 
Such a moral and intellectual atmosphere Froebel 
sought to cultivate at Keilhau by cooperation in domestic 
labor,— ‘lifting, pulling, carrying, digging, splitting,’ * and 
through coéperative construction out of blocks of a chapel, 
castle, and other features of a village;? and such an educa- 
tive participation was conceded to exist by theinspector of 
schools sent there with hostile intent.* Similarly, Baron- 
ess von Biilow tells us, the kindergarten was intended 
to “represent a miniature state for children, in which the 
young citizen can learn to move freely, but with con- 
sideration for his little fellows,” > and thus obtain mental 
and moral preparation for life. 
The Kindergarten, and Its Mother-Play, Gifts, and 
Occupations.—Thus throughout all Froebel’s educa- 
tional works and experiments, his basal principles of 
motor expression and social participation are con- 
stantly implied and illustrated. But Froebel also made 
a third contribution to educational practice in advo- 
cating as a means of realizing these principles a school 
without books or set intellectual tasks, and permeated 
with play, freedom, and joy. Even in the Education of 
Man he declares that the systematic use of ‘self-activity’ 
and ‘creativeness’ has been neglected in the education 
of the day. He consequently advocates development 
through drawing, domestic activities, gardening, build- 
ing of dams, houses, fortresses, paper-cutting, paste-

board work, modeling, and other forms of creation. It 
was not, however, until the period of Froebel’s kinder- 
garten at Blankenburg that these means of expression 
and socialization obtained their definite school organiza- 
tion. In the kindergarten, ‘self-activity’ and ‘creative- 
ness,’ together with social codperation, found complete 
application and concrete expression, and Froebel de- 
voted the rest of his life to developing and describing the 
course of this new educational institution. The training 
has always consisted of three codrdinate forms of ex- 
pression: (x) song, (2) movement and gesture, and 
(3) construction; and mingled with these’ and growing 
out of each is the use of language by the child. But 
these means, while separate, often codperate with and 
interpret one another, and the process is connected as 
an organic whole. For example, when the story is told 
or read, it is expressed in song, dramatized in movement 
and gesture, and illustrated by a construction from 
blocks, paper, clay, or other material by modeling or 
drawing. By thus embodying the ideas in objective 
form, imagination and thought are stimulated, the eye 
and hand trained, the muscles codrdinated, and the mo- 
tives and sentiments elevated and strengthened. 
The Mother Play and Nursery Songs were believed 
by Froebel'to contain the best illustration of his system. j 
Of them he says, ‘I have here laid down the fundamen- 
tal ideas of my educational principles.” This work 
consists of an organized series of carefully selected songs, 
games, and pictures, and is intended to make clear and 
direct the educational instinct of the mother. The songs 
should enable her to see that the child’s education begins 
at birth, and should awaken her to the responsibility of The training

garten has

sisted of

motherhood. They should likewise exercise the infant’s 
senses, limbs, and muscles, and, through the loving 
union between mother and child, draw both into in- 
telligent and agreeable relations with the common ob- 
jects of life about them. For the culture of the maternal 
consciousness, Froebel prefixed to the ‘play songs’ seven 
‘mother’s songs,’ in which he depicts the mother’s feel- 
ings in viewing her newborn infant, and her hopes and 
fears as she witnesses the unfolding physical and mental 
life of the child. The fifty ‘play songs’ are each con- 
nected with some simple nursery game, like ‘pat-a-cake,” 
‘hide-and-seek,’ or the imitation of some trade, and are 
intended to correspond to a special physical, mental, or 
moral need of the child. The selection and order of the 
songs were determined with reference to the child’s devel- 
opment, which ranges from almost reflex and instinctive 
movements up to an ability to represent his perceptions 
with drawings, accompanied by considerable growth of 
the moral sense. Each song contains three parts: (1) a 
motto for the guidance of the mother; (2) a verse with 
the accompanying music, to sing to the child; and (3) a 
Picture illustrating the verse. A more complete com- 
mentary is afforded by the ‘closing thoughts’ and the 
‘explanations’ furnished by Froebel at the end of the 
work.?

DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL PRACTICE 237 
materials are the so-called ‘gifts’ and ‘occupations.’ 
The distinction between these two types of media is 
rather arbitrary, as they are both intended. to stimulate 
motor expression and are closely connected in use. The 
‘occupations’ represent activities, while the ‘gifts’ fur- 
nish ideas for these activities. The ‘gifts’ combine and 
rearrange certain definite material, but do not change 
the form, while the ‘occupations’ reshape, modify, and 
transform their material. The products obtained from 
the one are transient, but from the other are more per- 
manent. The emphasis in kindergarten practice has 
come to be transferred from the ‘gifts’ to the ‘occupa- 
tions,’ which have been largely increased in range and 
number. Froebel strove to carry out his principle of 
‘development’ in the order and gradation of the ‘gifts.’ 
They are so arranged as to lead from the properties or 
activities of one to those of the next, and, while intro- 
ducing new impressions, repeat the old. Every new ‘gift’ 
is used alternately with the old, and the use of the new 
makes the play with the old freer and more intelligent. 
The first ‘gift’ consists of a box of six woolen balls of 
different colors. They are to be rolled about in play, 
and thus develop ideas of color, material, form, motion, 
direction, and muscular sensibility. A sphere, cube, 
and cylinder of hard wood compose the second ‘gift.’ 
Here, therefore, are found a known factor in the sphere 
and an unknown one in the cube. A comparison. is 
made of the stability of the cube with the movability 
of the sphere, and the two are harmonized in the cylinder, 
which possesses the characteristics and powers of each. 
The third ‘gift’ is a large wooden cube divided into 
eight equal cubes, thus teaching the relations of the and of the 
‘gifts’ and 
‘occupations.
-P-A-G-E-256
238 A HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
parts to the whole and to one another, and making pos- 
sible original constructions, such as armchairs, benches, 
thrones, doorways, monuments, or steps. The three 
following ‘gifts’ divide the cube in various ways so as 
to produce solid bodies of different types and sizes, and 
excite an interest in number, relation, and form. From 
them the children are encouraged to construct geomet- 
rical figures and ‘forms of beauty’ or artistic designs. 
The exercise the gifts afforded was not unlike the inven- 
tional drawing of Pestalozzi, except that actual material 
was used instead of outlining with a pencil. The most 
surprising ingenuity in invention was often displayed by 
the pupils in Froebel’s kindergarten. In addition to the 
six regular ‘gifts,’ he also introduced additional play 
with ‘tablets,’ ‘sticks,’ and ‘rings,’ sometimes known 
as ‘gifts seven to nine.’ This material introduces sur- 
faces, lines, and points in contrast with the preceding 
solids, and brings out the relations of area, outline, and 
circumference to volume. It offers innumerable oppor- 
tunities for the invention of symmetrical patterns and 
artistic design.* 
The ‘occupations,’ which apply to practice what has 
been assimilated through the ‘gifts,’ comprise a long list 
of constructions with paper, sand, clay, wood, and other 
materials. These require greater manual dexterity and 
include considerable original design. They should not 
be undertaken until after the ‘gifts,’ as one must be 
conscious of ideas before attempting to express them. 
3 Pictures of the ‘gifts’ and a more complete account of their use can 
be found in Froebel’s Pedagogics of the Kindergarien (translated by Jarvis),

garten Guide, First Volume.
-P-A-G-E-257
DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL PRACTICE 239 
Corresponding with the ‘gifts’ that deal with solids, 
may be grouped ‘occupations’ in clay modeling, card- 
board cutting, paper folding, and wood carving; and 
with those of surfaces may be associated mat and paper 
weaving, stick shaping, sewing, bead threading, paper 
pricking, and drawing.! 
The Value of Froebel’s Principles——For one pur- 
suing destructive criticism, it would not be difficult to 
find flaws in both the theory and practice of Froebel. 
The more superficial defects of his practice are singularly 
obtrusive, as, for example, in the material of the Mother 
Play. In this work the pictures are rough and poorly 
drawn, the music is crude, and the verses are lacking in 
rhythm, poetic spirit, and diction. They are difficult 
to memorize, and their arrangement and sequence seem 
at times to lack consistency. But the illustrations and 
songs served well the interests and needs of those for 
whom they were produced, and Froebel himself was not 
insistent that they should be used after more satisfactory 
compositions were found. He wished only to afford ex- 
amples of how the mother might aid in the development 
of her child, and no other collection of children’s songs 
has ever been devised to compare with his in educa- 
tional value. Other criticism of his material has been 
made on the ground that it was especially adapted to 
German ideals, German children, and the relatively 
simple village life of his experience, and that it needs 
considerable modification to suit other countries and the 
industrial organization of society to-day. Also the ar-

the letter of the exact order mentioned by Froebel, have been shown 
his methods. +4 violate the principles of modern psychology. ‘This 
would not be conceded by the literal followers of the 
master or those inclined to make a cult or mystery of 
Froebelianism. But his more liberal disciples realize 
that it is the spirit of his underlying principles, and not 
the letter of his practice, that should be followed, and 
have constantly struggled to keep the kindergarten 
matter and methods in harmony with the times and 
the environment. 
But the great- “The greatest hindrance to the acceptance of Froebel-

five reveal an inner significance.! At times this symbol- 
ism descends into a literal and verbal pun, where it 
seems to a modern that Froebel can hardly be in earnest, 
or is struggling for a suggestive system of mnemonics. 
Such is his explanation of the ‘nursling’ as a great ap- 
Propriating ‘ eye,’ and the ‘boy’as one who strives to ‘an- 
nounce’ himself,2--His theory of knowledge is likewise 
peculiar. Re “implies that general conceptions are im- 
plicit in the child, and each of these can be awakened by 
‘adumbration,’ that is, by presenting something that will 
symbolically represent that particular ‘innate idea.’ 
Thus in treating the gifts and games, he maintains that 
from a ball the pupil gathers an abstract notion of a ‘self- 
dependent whole and unity,’ while to the same child a 
cube represents a ‘developing manifold body.’* Simi- 
larly, his cosmology leads him to curious conclusions. 
Since God is the self-conscious spirit that originated both 
man and nature, Froebel held that everything is inter- 
connected, and each part of the universe may throw light 
on every other part. Hence he takes seriously every va- 
riety of poetic analogy between physical phenomena and 
mental or social. He constantly holds that a knowledge 
of external nature;—such as the formation of crystals, 
will enable one to comprehend the laws of the mind and of 
society. 
Unfortunately, this mystic symbolism, vague and ex- 
treme as it is, is regarded by the strict constructionists

treatment of the family he especially vents an eccentric disquisition on

such associations between common objects and abstract 
conceptions exist for children. But such an imaginary 
symbolic meaning may be forced upon an object by the 
teacher. Hence pupils in conservative kindergartens, 
without appreciating the underlying principles, soon 
learn to adopt the phrases and attitudes that will satisfy 
the teacher. This often tends to foster insincerity and 
sentimentalism rather than to inculcate abstract truth 
through symbols. Had Froebel possessed the enlarged 
knowledge of biology, physiology, and psychology that 
is available for one living in the twentieth century, it is 
unlikely that he would have insisted upon the symbolic 
foundations for his pedagogy. His real principles in edu- 
cation are heavily handicapped by these interpretations, 
and while quite consistent with his type of philosophy, 
might as easily have been inferred from very different 
positions in modern psychology. 
But whatever may be said of, his philosophy, incon- 
sistencies, or other shortcomings, Froebel has had a most 
happy effect upon education as ‘a wa In some re- 
spects he utilized features from other reformers. We 
have seen that he adopted many of Pestalozzi’s objective 
methods in geography, natural history, arithmetic, lan-. 
guage, drawing, writing and reading, and constructive 
geometry; he reiterated Rousseau’s views upon the in- 
fallibility of nature, negative education, and theory of 
maturing; and advocated the physical training and ex- 
cursions and walks as a means of study that are stressed

by both these reformers. In his hint at correlation and 
culture epochs, and especially in his use of stories, leg- 
ends, fables, and fairy-tales, he paralleled his contem- 
porary, Herbart, in his influence upon the curriculum. 
But in his emphasis upon motor expression, and upon the 
social aspects of education, together with his advocacy of 
a school without books or set tasks, Froebel was unique, 
and made a most distinctive contribution to educational 
practice. Pestalozzi had in his earlier career developed 
motor activity as a means of education through indus- 
trial training, but the ‘observation,’ which he introduced 
at the same time, was rather passive and but little 
connected with constructive expression. And while his 
use of drawing, music, and modeling provided a means 
of expression, it remained for Froebel to organize these 
and other subjects into the school procedure and to make 
motor expression essential instead of incidental. In his 
emphasis upon this factor of education, he might, how- 
ever, seem to be reverting to Rousseau, except that, 
quite in opposition to that reformer, Froebel also held 
that the training should not be given to isolated indi- 
viduals, but should operate through social participation. 
These two underlying and associated principles, worked 
out as they were through activities and informal school- 
ing, have become most distinctive of the Froebelian 
method, and have been most fruitful in their influence 
upon subsequent education. 
Whenever the real significance of his principles has 
been comprehended, they have been recognized as the 
most essential laws in the educational process, and are 
valued.as the means of all effective teaching. Froebel 
himself never worked out his theories in connection with and in his em-

244 A HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
the schooling beyond the kindergarten, although there is 
reason to believe that he intended to do so when he had 
time. But, in harmony with Froebel, all stages of edu- 
cation aré coming to realize the value of discovering and 
developing individuality by means of initiative, execu- 
tion, and codperation, and spontaneous activities, like 
play, construction, and occupational work have become 
more and more the means to this end. For example, the 
‘busy work,’ ‘whittling,’ ‘clay-modeling,’ and ‘sloyd,’ 
z which have during the past generation found a place in 
the grades of American schools, together with the more 
advanced types of ‘manual training,’ which have been in- 
troduced into the high schools and sometimes become the 
staple of a special type of secondary institution, have to 
a large degree sprung from the influence of Froebel. 
Uno Cygnaeus (1810-1888), who started the manual 
training movement, owed his inspiration to Froebel and 
his own desire to extend the kindergarten occupations 
through the grades. Asa result of his efforts Finland in 
1866 became the first country in the world to adopt man- 
ual training as an integral part of the course in theelemen- — 
tary and training schools. In 1874, through the visit of 
Otto Salomon (1849-1907) to Cygnaeus, Sweden trans- 
formed its sloyd from a system of teaching elementary 
trades and industrial training to the more educative 
method of manual training. This use of constructive and 
occupational work for educational purposes rather than for 
industrial efficiency soon spread throughout Europe, and, 
together with other forms of manual training, was first 
tence 4 the pnited States by the Centennial Exposi- 
educational theo, elphia. _ Various types of modern 
ry and practice, especially those asso-

ciated with experiments made in the United States, alsore- 
veal large elements of Froebelian influence. Among these 
might be included the work of Colonel Parker and of Pro- 
fessor John Dewey. Parker’s adaptation of part of Her- 
bartianism, especially concentration, has already been 
noted, but the Froebelian emphasis upon motor expres- 
sion, the social aspect of education, and informal schooling 
are evident throughout his work in the elementary school, 
and are even extended so as to include speech and the 
language-arts. Similarly, Dewey’s occupational work 
and industrial activities, which were used through the en- 
tire course of his ‘experimental school’ in Chicago,? al- 
though not copied directly from Froebel, closely ap- 
proached” the modified practice of the kindergarten. 
Moreover; in all these modern systems and materials 
where the factor of motor expression is prominent, em- 
phasis is also laid upon informality of training and the 
social aspect of education. Thus the influence of all 
three of the Froebelian contributions is everywhere 
patent. 
The Spread of Froebelianism through Furope.— 
Froebelianism and the kindergarten, then, contained 
principles that were destined to disseminate themselves 
by virtue of their educational value. But the spread of 
the kindergarten itself began directly after the death of 
Froebel through the reformer’s devoted followers. Froe- 
bel’s widow, Middendorf, and the Baroness von Biilow 
especially became the heirs of his spiritual possessions, 
. and proceeded at once to make the heritage productive. 
- Middendorf did not long survive the master, and Frau 
Froebel’s part in the wide evangelization was somewhat

limited by her education. It remained for the intellec- 
tual and cultured noblewoman, by means of her social 
position and knowledge of modern languages, to become 
the great apostle of Froebel throughout Europe. Shortly 
after his death, having failed to obtain a revocation of the 
edict in Prussia from either the ministry or the king, the 
baroness turned to foreign lands. She visited France, 
Belgium, Holland, Italy, Russia, and nearly every other 
section of Europe, and in 1867 was invited to speak before 
the ‘Congress of Philosophers’ at Frankfort. This dis- 
tinguished gathering had been called to inquire into con- 
temporary educational movements, and after her eluci- 
dation of Froebelianism, a standing committee of the 
Congress, known as the ‘Froebel Union,’ was formed to 
study the system. 
As a result of the labors of the baroness, the propa- 
ganda was everywhere eagerly embraced. Kindergar- 
tens, training schools, and journals devoted to the 
movement rapidly sprang up on all sides. While the 
kindergarten was not generally adopted by the govern- 
ments, it was widely established by voluntary means 
throughout western Europe, and has since met with a 
noteworthy growth. Instruction in Froebelian princi- 
‘ples is now generally required in most normal and 
teacher training institutions of Europe. Sometimes, as 
in France and England, it has been combined with the 
infant school movement,! and has lost some of its most 
vital characteristics, but even in these cases the cross- 
fertilization has afforded abundant educational fruitage. 
Only in Germany, the native land of the kindergarten, 
has serious hostility to the idea remained. The deaden-

ing effects of the decree in Prussia hung over the German 
states for a decade; and even since the removal of the ban, 
kindergartens have, with few exceptions, never been rec- 
ognized as genuine schools or part of the regular state sys- 
tem. Even to-day the German kindergarten is regarded 
as little more than a day nursery or convenient place to 
deposit small children and have them amused.? 
The Kindergarten in the United States.—The de- 
velopment and influence of the kindergarten have been 
more marked in the United States than in any other coun- 
try, and its history there demands consideration in some 
detail. The first attempts at kindergartens in America 
were made shortly after the middle of the nineteenth cen- 
tury. Educated Germans, who had emigrated to Amer- 
ica because of the unsettled conditions at home resulting 
from the revolutionary days of 1848, established private 
schools, which usually included kindergartens, for their 
children. In 1860 Elizabeth P. Peabody and others be- 
came interested in accounts of Froebel’s system made by 
Mrs. Carl Schurz, and, without a proper knowledge of the 
details, undertook to open a kindergarten in Boston. Not- 
withstanding the immediate successof this institution and 
the evident enjoyment of the children, Miss Peabody felt 
that she had not succeeded in getting the real principles 
and spirit of Froebel, and in 1867 she went to study with 
his widow, who had been settled in Hamburg for several 
years. Upon her return the following year Miss Peabody 
1 When Professor Payne of the London College of Preceptors visited 
the kindergartens in six German cities in 1874, he found that, while the 
theory was just, natural, and all-sided, the teachers were inefficient, and 
the rooms were often small, unsanitary, and ifl-lighted. (See Payne, 
Lectures on the History of Education, pp. 203~271.) Even now, forty 
years later, the same general conditions seem to obtain, The kinder-

corrected the errors in her work and established a periodi- 
cal to explain and spread Froebelianism. The remainder 
of her life was spent in interesting parents, philanthro- 
pists, and school boards in the movement, and a service 
was done for the kindergarten in America almost equal 
to that of Baroness von Biilow in Europe. In 1868 
through Miss Peabody the first training school for kin- 
dergartners in the United States was established at 
Boston. A similar institution was opened in New York 
by 1872 in charge of Maria Bolte.! Fraulein Bolte had 
studied with Frau Froebel, and had been induced to settle 
in New York. Through her pupils and those of other 
German kindergartners, the cause was rapidly promoted. 
The same year saw the beginning of Susan E. Blow’s 
great work in St. Louis, where her free training school 
for kindergartners was opened. Two years later 5. H. 
Hill of Florence, Massachusetts, started a munificent 
provision for free kindergartens in his vicinity, and four 
years after that Mrs. Quincy A. Shaw began establish- 
ing them at various locations in the neighborhood of 
Boston, until she was supporting at least thirty such 
institutions. Many other philanthropic persons be- 
came much interested, and over one hundred voluntary 
associations were soon organized to found and maintain 
kindergartens. Through the work of Emma Marwedel, 
who was invited to California in 1876 by the ‘Froebel 
Union,’ successful training classes were established at Los 
Angeles, Oakland, and Berkeley. Voluntary kindergar- 
tens were also rapidly opened, and there was organized 
in 1878 the ‘Golden Gate Association’ at San Francisco, 
1 She afterward became widely known as Mrs. Maria Kraus-Bilte, and

which at its height supported forty-one free institutions 
and an excellent training school. In Milwaukee, Cincin- 
nati, Detroit, Pittsburg, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Cleve- 
land, Washington, Chicago, Louisville, and other centers, 
between 1870 and 18go subscriptions were raised by the 
churches and other philanthropic agencies, and the work 
everywhere grew apace. By the close of the century there 
were about five hundred such voluntary associations. 
But philanthropy and private foundations, after all, 
are restrictive, and it was not until the kindergartens be- 
gan to be adopted by the school systems that the move- % 
ment became truly national in the United States. Boston 
in the early seventies added a few kindergartens to her 
public schools, but after several years of trial gave them 
up on account of the expense. ‘The first permanent estab- 
lishment under a city board was made in 1873 at St. Louis 
through the efforts of Miss Blow and Dr. William T. Har- 
tis, then city superintendent of schools. Twelve kinder- 
gartens were organized at first, but others were opened 
as rapidly as competent directors could be prepared at 
Miss Blow’s training school. Within a decade there were 
more than fifty public kindergartens and nearly eight 
thousand pupils in St. Louis. San Francisco authorized 
the incorporation of kindergartens in the public schools 
in 1880; and between that date and the end of the century 
New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Buffalo, Pittsburg, 
Rochester, Providence, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, and 
most other progressive cities and even many smaller mu- 
nicipalities made the work an integral part of their system. 
In some states the adoption of kindergartens was delayed 
by the necessity of securing special legislation to admit 
children to school under the age of five or six. Statutes, and volun- 
‘aty associa- 
tions sprang 
up in five 
hundred cen- 
ters before 
the end of the 
century.

however, were eventually passed in most states where 
they were needed, and by 1900 there were some two hun- 
dred cities that included this stage of education in their| 
schools. That indicated a total of about fifteen hundred) 
public kindergartens, with nearly twice as many teachers 
and considerably over one hundred thousand pupils. 
About twenty of the cities employed a special supervisor 
to inspect the work. Excellent training schools for kin- 
dergartners are now maintained by half a hundred public 
and quasi-public normal institutions. A large number of 
extensive treatises, manuals, and periodicals devoted to 
the subject of kindergarten work are published, and have 
a wide circulation in every state of the Union. 
The Influence of Herbart and Froebel.—It is now ob- 
vious how large a part in the development of modern 
educational practice has been played by Herbart and 
Froebel. There are few tendencies in the curricula and 
methods of the schools to-day that cannot be traced back 
to them, or to Pestalozzi, their master. But the reforms 
of all three find their roots in Rousseau. By his insist- 
ence upon a ‘natural’ education, he started the modern 
social, psychological, and scientific movements in educa- 
‘tion, and opened the road for the present-day improve- 
ments in organization, method, and content. This ‘nat- 
uralism’ was continued by Pestalozzi’s ‘development’ 
and ‘sense perception,’ and these aspects were further 
elaborated by Froebel and Herbart respectively. Through 
his own ‘observation’ methods, Pestalozzi greatly im- 
proved the teaching of arithmetic, language work, geog- 
raphy, elementary science, drawing, writing, reading, 
and music, and, by means of Fellenberg’s work, developed 
industrial and philanthropic training. As a result of

and, through his carefully wrought educational doctrines,

      CHAPTER VIII 
LATER DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC EDUCATION IN THE 
UNITED STATES 
Pe ne. Common Schools in New England since the Revival— 
land was part We may now return to our account of the progress in 
of a Seneral American public education. The development of com- 
but the effects mon schools that took place in 1835-1860 was not con- 
ment there fined to New England. The new ideals of democracy were 
have eee coming to be felt in American education, and during this 
_period a rapid advance was taking place in the evolution 
of that unique product, the American common school. 
The ‘revival’ in New England has been most empha- 
Ye, sized by historians, but the movement was general and 
a did not have its sole source there. The work of Horace 
Mann and his predecessors and associates was but part 
of a much wider tendency. A little study reveals the 
fact that the influence of the awakening was felt in the 
education of practically every state, and that New Eng- 
land is simply typical of the country at large, It is true, 
however, that, owing to the decadence which had taken 
place in the schools of Massachusetts and Connecticut 
since colonial days, the effects of the awakening have 
been most profound and striking there. In Massachu- 
setts Horace Mann has been succeeded in the central 
administration by seven scholarly and experienced 
educators, who have believed as firmly as he that all 
stages of education below the college should bg open at 
256
-P-A-G-E-275
LATER DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC EDUCATION 257 
public expense without let or hindrance to the richest 
and poorest child alike, and that the smallest town should 
possess as good opportunities as the largest. Since the 
revival the state has likewise seen a steady growth of sen- 
timent for universal education and improved schooling, 
and never again has such an upheaval of the educational 
strata been necessary. The income of the state school 
fund and additional appropriations have been steadily 
increased, their apportionment among the towns has 
been rendered more equitable from time to time, and an 
effort has constantly been made to distribute them in 
such a way as to encourage local effort and codperation. th 
The school term has been Jengthened to ten months and 
the average attendance of a pupil to seven years. The 
amount of truancy and irregularity has become almost i 
negligible through strictly enforced attendance laws. 
The improvements in school buildings, sanitation, and 
equipment begun by Mann have steadily advanced. 
The district system died hard. Mann’s official successors 
all strove tactfully to abolish it, but not until 1882 
was it altogether forced out of existence. Most of the 
academies, which proved such a hindrance to the develop- 
ment of public secondary education, gradually died or _ 
were merged in the public system as high schools. By 
means of state aid, it has been possible since 1903 for 
the smallest towns to afford a high school training for 
their children at public expense. Supervision has also 
become universal during the past quarter century. 
Springfield first introduced a superintendent of schools 
in 1841, Gloucester in 1850, Boston in 1851, and the other

district superintendency, expert supervision has become 
possible everywhere, and during the last decade it has 
been compulsory. The normal schools, which have now 
increased to ten, have brought about a striking improve- 
ment in teaching. It is practically impossible at present 
for an untrained teacher to secure a position in the 
primary, intermediate, or grammar schools of Massachu- 
setts, and, through a system of examinations and inves- 
tigations, teachers of exceptional ability have, since 
1896, been granted an extra weekly allowance by the 
state. Since the middle of the century, the state board 
has been permitted to appoint a number of agents, to 
assist in inspecting and improving the schools, especially 
in the smaller towns and rural districts. 
The course of development since the awakening has 
been very similar in the other New England states. Bar- 
nard was succeeded in the central administration both 
in Rhode Island and Connecticut by a series of skilled 
and earnest educators, and, while their reports lacked 
his literary touch, they were of a rather more 
practical character. Until 1856, under John D. Phil- 
brick, Barnard’s immediate successor, Connecticut made 
no attempt to return from the parish to the town 
organization. Even this, as well as all subsequent 
legislation on the subject, was ‘permissive,’ and not until 
the twentieth century was the ‘school society,’ or district 
system, given up in half of the towns. In Rhode Island, 
even after Barnard’s reforms, almost one-third of the 
districts did not own their school buildings, owing to the 
survival of the method in use when the schools were 
private, but this condition has gradually been remedied. 
Likewise the number of towns levying sufficient local

LATER DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC EDUCATION 259 
taxes to secure a share in the state apportionment rapidly 
grew, and the state appropriation itself doubled and 
quadrupled within a generation. The odds against the 
rapid development of public education in the three other 
New England states were much greater than in Massa- 
chusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. In Vermont, 
New Hampshire, and Maine the amount of wealth was 
small, the soil infertile, the population sparse, and large 
cities few in number. But while effective education | 
could be reached only by slow and cautious steps, it was 
at last attained. These states have gradually followed 
the example of the older commonwealths, and centralized 
their educational administration through the abolition 
of the district system and the creation at various times 
of a state superintendent, a state commissioner, or a 
state board and secretary. This reorganization and 
renewed educational spirit has resulted in increased state 
school funds and appropriations, more systematic statis- 
tics and reports from the schools, and great advances 
in universalizing all stages of education at public expense, 
regularity of attendance, length of school term, material 
equipment, course and methods, text-books, supervision, 
and training of teachers. 
Influence of the Awakening upon the Middle States— 
Thus the New England states, responding to the call of 
Horace Mann, Henry Barnard, and their forerunners, 
contemporaries, and successors, rose to the enlarged 
ideals of the time, and therein furnish a typical represen 
tation of the democratic process by which the America) 
state moves toward educational reform, But this awal:

effects have been most patent and spectacular there. 
Nearly all of the other states seem to have exhibited a 
similar enthusiasm during the period and to have felt 
the influence of the awakening afterward. In close 
conjunction with the awakening in New England, the 
movement appeared in New York, especially the western 
part, and was more or less evident in Pennsylvania, 
New Jersey, and Delaware. But because of its cosmopoli- 
tanism and the need of fusing so many different political, 
religious, and industrial traditions, the older parts of 
New York, where the school system had until the awak- 
ening been rather in advance of other states, did not 
progress as rapidly in the development of public educa- 
tion as Massachusetts and Connecticut, with their more 
homogeneous population. It had, however, by the time 
of the Civil War, succeeded in working over its hetero- 
geneous people into a unified civilization and in causing 
their children to be educated together for a common 
citizenship. The most distinct advances during this 
period of final organization were in the administration 
and supervision of the system, the establishment of state 
normal schools, in the place of subsidized academies, 
for training teachers, and in the methods of state support 
of education. In 1842 county supervision had been 
provided, but, after a contest of three years, this pro- 
vision was abolished, and was not restored until 1856, 
when it took the form of district superintendence. In 
this latter year school commissioners were established 
for the supervision of cities and villages. Two years 
before (1854), the state superintendency had once more 
been separated from the secretaryship of state, with 
which it had been combined for thirty-five years. The
-P-A-G-E-279
LATER DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC EDUCATION 261 
governor, secretary of state, and others for several years 
urged the establishment of state normal schools, and at 
length, in 1844, the first was opened at Albany. This 
pioneer institution was eventually followed. by ten 
others. In 1856, after considerable agitation, a three- 
quarters of a mill tax was placed upon the property 
valuation of the state, and during the next dozen years 
many improvements were made in the disbursing and 
accounting of public funds..” At length, in 1867, the long 
fight that had been made for entirely free education was 
successfu!. Until then nearly fifty thousand children 
had been deprived of all education, because their parents 
were too proud to secure payment of their tuition fees 
by confessing themselves paupers. It was during this era 
of progress, too, that New York City was, in 1842, 
allowed to place the direction of its schools in the hands 
of a board of education, elected by the people, instead 
of giving over the city’s share of the state funds to a 
quasi-public society, controlled by a close corporation. 
For eleven years, however, the Public School Society 
refused to give up its work, but by 1853 it decided to 
disband and merge its buildings and funds with those of 
the city.? 
Pennsylvania was slower than New York in showing 
the effects of the educational awakening, but the leaven 
was at work. While a number of progressive governors 
and other statesmen continually recommended the devel- 
opment of public education, and the ‘Pennsylvania So- 
ciety for the Promotion of Common Schools’ had been 
organized, the towering leader in this movement was 
Thomas H. Burrowes. As secretary of state and ex officio

superintendent of schools (1836-1838), asa privatecitizen, 
public speaker, and educational journalist (1838-1860), 
and as state superintendent (1860-1862), he constantly 
urged a complete system of public education, the estab-

of education, and the organization of state and county su- 
pervision. In the interest of common schools, he visited, 
interviewed, and circularized every portion of the state, 
organized meetings, and wrote articles and treatises. 
By 1843 school directors of counties and boroughs were 
empowered to examine and certify teachers and to ap- 
point a salaried inspector of schools, and the appropria- 
tions to colleges, academies, and seminaries were cut in 
two, preparatory to discontinuing them altogether. Five 
years later the ‘permissive’ feature of the law of 1834 
was abolished, and the two hundred districts that had 
thus far refused to establish public schools were forced to 
do so under its provisions. In 1854 a revised school 
law was passed, which, after twenty years, now made 
the state system of education complete. It established 
in the secretary of state’s office a deputy superintendent 
of schools, who had virtually a separate Jonertrmon+-

lished at first by private enterprise and without state 
subsidy. By 1877 they were in operation in ten counties 
and were maintained largely by the state, and a number 
of others have at various times since been added. 
Educational progress in New Jersey also took some 
time to get under way, but when the reforms once started, 
they continued until an excellent system of common 
schools had been inaugurated. In 1838 the limitation 
of state funds to the education of the poor was removed, 
and the apportionment of the income from them was 
thereafter applied only to public schools. The townships 
were allowed to levy local taxes to the amount of twice 
what they received from the state, but for about a decade 
not more than one-half to two-thirds of them adopted a 
tax, and the state money was spent so wastefully that 
nearly four-fifths of the cost of public schools had to 
be paid by tuition fees. After 13848, when a state super- 
intendency was established, the development was more 
rapid. Within a dozen years, the appropriations were 
greatly increased, the expenditures in the townships 
rose to more than twelvefold, one-quarter of the schools 
became absolutely free, a state normal school was estab- 
lished at Trenton, and county supervision was introduced. 
Thus before the Civil War New Jersey had been brought 
out of the depressing educational conditions of the past. 
Delaware, on the other hand, failed to live up to the 
possibilities under her early ‘permissive’ laws. Even the 
organization of the friends of common school education, 
under the presidency of Judge Willard Hall, showed 
itself very conservative, and would not advocate the Pevisi

states, Delaware did not establish a completely organized 
state system until after the war. Even then, while a 
state board and state superintendency were established 
in 1875, there were no county superintendents, and when

Indiana, and Ninian W. Edwards in Illinois, the friends 
of public education had marshalled themselves for battle.

in behalf of common schools were frequent in most

In 1853 Ohio once more obtained a separate state de-

missioner’;+ the year before, Indiana eliminated all: 
option concerning taxation on the part of the counties, 
and organized universal education; and in the year fol- 
lowing, a system of public education with a state super- 
intendent was established by Illinois. The contest, of 
course, was not ended, as reactionary elements, with 
selfish, local, and sectarian interests, still remained, but 
their contentions have never again been more than par- 
tially successful. New features of the common schools, 
such as efficient teachers for the rural districts, county 
supervision, state normal training, and free higher educa- 
tion in state universities, have gradually rendered the 
state systems more consistent and complete.

of the university funds, however, was gradually stopped, 
and between 1852 and 1860 ‘union’ and high schools were 
rapidly developed to supply the means of fitting for the 
university. This latter institution became virtually free 
in 1842, and in 1850 a state normal school was founded. 
In all the other territory acquired or purchased by 
the United States in its westward expansion, the educa- 
tional history has been very similar to that in the first 
states of the Northwest. Progress in common school 
sentiment has been made pari passu with the settlement 
of the country. Each state, upon admission, has received 
its sixteenth section of school land and two townships 
for a university, and in the states admitted since 1848 
the endowment of schools has been increased to two 
sections, while Texas, which had been an independent 
republic (1836-1845), stipulated before becoming a state 
that it should retain sole possession of its public lands, 
and has set aside for education nearly two and one-half 
millions of acres. Hence in the first constitution per- 
manent school and university funds have generally been 
provided, and a regular organization of the schools of 
the state, with a central authority of some sort, has 
simultaneously appeared with the entry of new states. 
In few cases have sectarian interests been able to delay 
or injure the growth of common schools in any of the
-P-A-G-E-285

later commonwealths, and the interpretation of public 
education as schools for the children of paupers has never 
seriously influenced the West. The triumph of the 
common school idea has been made complete, but it 
has been rendered more consistent in the West and has 
there developed original elements of the greatest value. 
Organization of State Systems in the South.—Thus 
through the awakening of common schools that occurred 
throughout the union from 1835 to 1860 was the old-time 
country and city district school of the North lifted up 
to the present system of graded free elementary, second- 
ary, and normal schools, together with city and state 
universities. But these results were not at first as fully 
realized in the South, because of the approach and 
precipitation of the dreadful internecine conflict that 
weighed down and finally prostrated the resources of 
that section of the United States. During the earlier 
years of the awakening, and in some states up to. the 
very verge. of the Civil War, however, great progress 
in public education was noticeable. The attendance o 
- in the common schools, established in several states by 
‘permissive’ legislation, had been rapidly growing for 
a score of years, and there was an increasing body of 
prominent men desirous of enlarging popular education. 
During the early forties there were many efforts and sug- 
gestions for a system of public schools, and several con- 
* ventions were held in the interest of such institutions. 
North Carolina, moreover, established a public school 
system in 1839, and state, county, and local administra- 
tive organization was well provided for and support ob- 
tained through the ‘literary fund’ and local taxation.

efforts toward state organizations, which, while less suc- 
cessful, were maintained for some time. As late as 1858 
Georgia took a distinct step forward in this direction, while 
Charleston (1856) and other leading cities of the South 
greatly strengthened their public school systems. The 
Southern states generally seem to have been profoundly 
stirred by the vigorous movement that was going on. 
Such leaders as Barnard and Mann were greatly esteemed 
-in the South, and their advice was not infrequently 
sought in various commonwealths. Even in their seces- 
sion conventions some states, like Georgia, adopted 
resolutions or constitutional amendments looking to 
the education of the people, and North Carolina in 1863, 
with the union army actually at its doors, undertook 
to grade the schools and provide for the troinine of 
teachers. But, in general, as the impending -

year. Property and poll taxation were established for 
the support of the schools. A state superintendent and 
state board of education, and county commissioners and a 
county board and trustees in each district, were provided 
for. Text-book commissions were often established, and 
free books were granted to poor children. The foundation 
for a real system was thus laid. This was a tremendous 
undertaking, and it shows the greatest courage and 
executive ability upon the part of the South to have 
brought it to pass. Property had been diminished in 
valuation to the extent of nearly two billion dollars, 
and there were two million children to be educated. 
Moreover, under the reconstruction régime, the tax 
on property was often not collected, and the appropria- 
tions for education remained on paper.? Indifference 
and inexperience were aggravated by the fear that

2. W. Knight has shown in his Influence of Reconstruction on Educa- 
tion in the South (New York, 1913) that undue credit has been given the 
reconstruction régime for interest in popular education. “The legisla- 
tures were indeed most liberal in making appropriations for schools; but 
the appropriations seem not to have been paid fully or even in large part.” : :

millennial zeal in behalf of universal brotherhood. These 
and many other obstacles for fully a decade constituted 
an enormous stumbling-block. Several factors, however, 
aided and encouraged the South in its efforts. Of these 
the most important was the foundation in 1867 of the 
Peabody Educational Fund of $2,000,000, well character- 
ized as “a gift to the suffering South for the good of the 
Union.” George Peabody, the donor, while a native 
of Massachusetts, had lived for a time in the South, and 
realized that the nation could not prosper while such an 
untoward educational situation existed anywhere. Under 
a board of trustees, composed of the most distinguished 
men of the nation, and through the direct management 
of the wisest and most sympathetic agents, this fund 
performed a magnificent service. By an appeal to the 
higher sentiment of the communities and states, it 
awakened and stimulated educational effort by granting 
the necessary assistance. When it proved insufficient 
for the great task, the trustees pleaded with Congress 
for an additional subsidy, and made the whole country 
aware of the crying needs of education in the South. 
Mr. Peabody hoped that his example might be followed 
by others, and such has been the case, for more than ten 
million dollars have been contributed for similar purposes 
from several sources. Aid has thus been granted to 
various grades of public education, institutions to train 
teachers for the new schools have been established, and 
both white and colored children are being given oppor- 
tunities for a thorough public school education. 
Despite the tremendous rally during the seventies, 
“however, the struggle for public education in the South 
was not won for twenty years, but complete systems

    LATER DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC EDUCATION 271 
of common schools have now at length been generally ‘the sentiment 
established. Even the first results of this universal aie FOr 
education were gratifying, especially in the poorer Public educa 
districts, and advanced features have rapidly been since 1890 
added. With the cessation of the reconstruction in- ee ome 
fluence and the subsidence of the dread of mixed schools, 
attendance and appropriations have greatly increased, 
girls have come to be given equal opportunities with the 
boys, the education of colored children has been ade~ 
quately supported, and provision has been made for train- 
ing and stimulating teachers of both races. Separatestate 
institutions for higher education, cultural and vocational, 
have been established to furnish a broad education for 
both whites and negroes. Since 1890 there has been 
no evidence of any widespread hostility to public educa- 
tion, and the expenditures and intensive improvement 
of the schools have been constantly progressing. 
in the Southern states there has been a continual, though 
somewhat fluctuating, growth of a sentiment for common 
schools from the time of its initiation by the broad- 
visioned Jefferson to the universal sentiment of to-day. 
It evolved through long years of varied success and fail- 
ure, and broke its chrysalis after the wreck of the Civil 
War, and gradually attained to its present proportions. 
Its achievements during the past two decades seem al- 
most unparalleled in history. 
With its final development in the South during the last 
decade of the nineteenth century, the distinctly American development 
public school system may be said to have been fully elab- in the South, 
orated. The educational ideals and traditions imported eo ean 
from Europe have gradually been modified and adapted i 
to the needs of America. Schools have become pub- elaborated,

lic and free in the modern sense. The control of education 
has passed from private parties and even quasi-public 
societies to the state. The schools have likewise come to 
be supported by the state, and are open to all children 
alike without the imposition of any financial obligation. 
This latter step has been taken very slowly, and it was not 
accomplished in most states until after the Civil War. In 
secondary education, the academies, which supplanted 
the ‘grammar’ schools, first became ‘free academies’ and 
made no charge for tuition from local patrons, though re- 
maining close corporations, and then were in time replaced 
by the true American secondary institution,—the high 
school. Colleges became largely nonsectarian, even when 
not nominally so, and state universities were organized in 
all except a few of the oldest commonwealths. Thus has 
the idea of common schools and the right to use the public 
wealth to educate the entire body of children into sound 
American citizenship been made complete., Although the 
system is still capable of much improvement, it is expres- 
sive of American genius and development. It is simply 
the American idea of government and society applied to 
education. It is the educational will of the people ex- 
pressed through the majority, and the resultant of the 
highest thinking and aspirations of a great nation made 
up of the most powerful and progressive elements of all

CHAPTER IX 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN SCHOOL SYSTEMS 
National Systems of Education in Europe and Can- 
~ ada.—In previous chapters (IV, VI, VHI,) we have wit- 
nessed the gradual evolution in America of state systems 
of universal education out of the unorganized and rather 
aristocratic arrangement of schools that had first been 
transplanted from Europe in the seventeenth century. 
But development of a centralized organization of public 
schools has not been confined to the United States. Dur- 
ing the past century and a half, the leading powers of 
Europe, especially Germany, France, and England, and 
the more recently federated Dominion of Canada, have 
likewise organized state systems of education similar in 
some respects to those of the American union. All of 
these countries have now established universal elementary 
education free to all, although as yet in few instances are 
secondary schools also gratuitous. France alone has 
completely secularized its system, but the public schools 
of the other nations, while still including religious instruc- 
tion, have been emancipated from ecclesiastical control, 
and are responsible to the civil authorities. In all of 
them school attendance is compulsory. As we have al- 
ready noticed, accounts of this development of national 
systems of education by the European states have proved 
a great source of illumination and inspiration for America.

Yet the educational system in none of these countries is 
identical with that in the United States, but has been 
adapted in each case to the genius and social organiza- 
tion of the people concerned. Its characteristics must, 
therefore, be considerably modified, in order to be util- 
ized or to prove suggestive to other nations, and can be 
understood only in the light of the educational history of 
the particular country to which it belongs. For an in- 
telligent appreciation of these modern school systems, 
we must, therefore, trace the gradual development to 
their present form in response to the changing ideals of 
successive periods, although it will take us considerably 
back of the period we are now considering. 
Early History of German Educational Institutions. — 
The earliest of the European school systems to be estab- 
lished upon anything like the present basis appear in the 
various states of Germany during the eighteenth century. 
Some centuries before, however, most of the elements in 
these educational organizations had arisen and had since 
passed through various stages of their history. The uni- 
" versities in many instances date back to the general 
spread of these institutions in Germany during the four- 
teenth and fifteenth centuries.!_ In the fifteenth and six- 
teenth centuries they began to feel the influence of hu- 
manism and to introduce chairs of classic literature.? 
During the Reformation many of them withdrew from 
the control of church and pope, and came under the state 
and the Protestant princes; and, as an outgrowth of the 
theological agitation, several new universities, Protestant 
and Catholic, were founded.? By the end of the eight-

century.? The German elementary schools, which came 
to be known as Volksschulen, or ‘people’s schools,’ on the 
other hand, find their roots in the Reformation. Luther 
and his associates continually urged the education of the 
common people, and a rudimentary system of elementary 
schools began to be established by the princes in various 
German states during the sixteenth and seventeenth cen- 
turies.2 During the latter century there was a decided 
tendency throughout the people’s schools to add to the

nineteenth century the schools had become political 
rather than ecclesiastical institutions. The state assumed 
the real management of education, although the clergy

declared to be not simply church organizations, but to 
belong to the state (1687), although the teacher was 
still regarded as a sort of pastor’s assistant. Various 
other steps were also taken toward strengthening the 
system. A reformation and reorganization of schools 
was inaugurated (1540), parents were ordered to keep 
their children regularly in school (1648), and it was 
decreed that schools should as far as possible be estab- 
lished in the villages as well as the cities (1687). 
The Reforms of Frederick William I.—These reforms, 
however, were not fully realized at the time, although 
they pointed out the direction of educational progress. 
The greatest developments occurred in the eighteenth decided steps

efficient organization of the civil service. He was liberal 
toward elementary schools, establishing some: eighteen 
hundred of them with money saved from the expenses 
of the royal household, and he endeavored to make 
attendance compulsory. In 1717 he decreed that, 
wherever schools existed, children should be required 
to attend during the winter, and in the summer when- 
ever they could be spared by their parents, which must 
be at least once a week. He founded the first teach- 
ers’ seminary at Stettin in 1735 from his own private 
means, and the next year he caused another to be es- 
tablished at Magdeburg. The same year (1736) he also 
had a definite law passed, making education compulsory 
for children from six to twelve years of age. 
Educational Achievements of Frederick the Great— 
By such acts Frederick William I demonstrated his 
belief that the state should not relegate elementary 
training to the church and locality, but should itself 
see that adequate provision was made, and he thus 
started an educational tendency that was to be further 
developed during the reign of his more able son. Fred- 
's erick the Great was humane, tolerant in religion, and 
sympathetic with the scientific spirit of the rationalists. 
humanized his government and laws, permitted freedom 
of speech and of the press, and greatly promoted research.

emy of Nobles,’ ! to train young aristocrats to become 
army officers and diplomats. Likewise he greatly im- 
proved secondary education by placing all the provincial 
‘consistories,’ except that in the Catholic duchy of 
Silesia, under the jurisdiction of the one at the capital 
(1750). Through this central control, a few excellent 
Gymnasien with uniform courses were developed out 
of a large number of weak classical schools. His achieve- 
ments in behalf of universal education were even more 
noteworthy. During the earlier years of his reign he 
issued several decrees concerning the support of schools 
established in villages, and in 1750 he ordered that all 
vacancies in schools on the crown lands and adminis- 
trative villages be filled by graduates from the real-school 
and seminary founded by Hecker at Berlin three years 
before. But the greatest step toward a national system 
did not take place until 1763, when he issued his General 
School Regulations for the Country. This decree re- 
quired children to attend school from five until thirteen 
or fourteen, and until they “know not only what is 
necessary of Christianity, fluent reading, and writing, 
but can give answer in everything which they learn 
from the school books prescribed and approved by 
our consistory.” If any pupils should arrive at this state 
of proficiency before thirteen or fourteen, they could 
even then leave school only through the official certifi- 
cation of the teacher, minister, and inspector. ‘Provision 
was also made for the attendance of children who had to 
herd cattle or were too poor to pay the school fees. Sun- 
day continuation schools were to be established for young 
people beyond the school age. Teachers must have

attended Hecker’s seminary and had to be examined and 
licensed by the inspector. Arrangements were also made 
for stated visits to the school and conferences with the 
teacher by the local pastor and for annual inspection 
and report by the superintendent and inspector of each 
administrative district. This decree was supplemented 
in 1765 with similar Regulations for the Catholic Schools 
in Silesia, drawn up by Abbot Felbiger. 
Frederick, however, was somewhat in advance of 
general sentiment. The carrying out of the decree was 
stubbornly opposed by many teachers, who could not 
meet the new requirements; by farmers, who objected 
to the loss of their children’s time; and by the nobles, 
who feared the discontent and uprising of the peasants, 
in case they were educated. The execution of the regu- 
lation was still in the power of the clergy, and for some 
time it proved but little more than a pious wish.1 But 
the monarch strove hard to have it enforced, and it 
became the foundation for the more effective laws that 
have since become embodied in the Prussian school 
system. After 1771 the educational work of Frederick 
was substantially aided by the appointment of Baron von 
Zedlitz as head of the Department of Lutheran Church 
and School Affairs. This great minister had been much 
impressed by Basedow’s principles and experiments and 
by Rochow’s application of the ‘naturalistic’ training 
in reforming rural education.2. He was eager to assist 
in elevating the condition of the peasants, and, through 
his efforts, before the close of Frederick’s teign the course

  DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN SCHOOL SYSTEMS 283 
of the village schools was greatly strengthened and 
enriched, and a regular normal school was opened at 
Halberstadt (1778). Zedlitz likewise took a decided 
interest in the movement of ‘new humanism,’ which, 
under the leadership of Gesner, Heyne, and Emnesti, 
had for a generation been stressing a study of the litera- 
ture, thought, and content of the classics rather than 
the linguistic and formal grind that was in vogue. While 
he lacked the hearty support of the conservative school 
authorities in the reforms he was commissioned to make 
in the Gymnasien (1779), he succeeded in reviving the 
humanistic ideal in secondary education. 
Zedlitz and the Inauguration of an Oberschulcolleg- 
ium——The management of the schools, however, still 
remained in the hands of the clergy. It was not until 
the year after Frederick’s death that his policy of nation- 
alizing education culminated in the organization of an 
Oberschulcollegium or central board of administration 
for all affairs in Prussia (1787). This new method of 
control was largely the work of Zedlitz, who had been 
influenced by Basedow’s suggestion of a central board of 
education in his Address on Schools and Studies (1768). * 
He held for some time that an organization of this sort, 
made up of experts, would be much more efficient than 
church consistories under the king’s minister, and he per- 
suaded the new sovereign, Frederick William II (r. 1786- 
1797), to ttansfer the schools from ecclesiastical to state 2 
control, : Unfortunately this king was a reactionary. He 
did not really wish to establish a national system of edu- 
cation, and held that the main business of the schools was 
to teach religion. While Zedlitz was made chairman, the diction.

membership of the Oberschulcollegium was mostly filled 
from the clergy, and the king refused to extend its juris- 
diction to the higher schools. It was thus impossible to 
complete a uniform system, and the schools remained 
under the control of the church and were only indirectly 
responsible to the state. 
The General Code of 1794 and Further Development 
of a National System-—Despite the reactionary policy 
of Frederick William II, a further step toward a national 
school system was taken during his reign. In 1794 there 
was published a General Code, or fundamental civil law 
of Prussia, and in the chapter upon education! was 
formulated the centralization that had been developing 
throughout the century. The law declared in unequiv- 
ocal terms: 
“ All schools and universities are state institutions, charged with 
the instruction of youth in useful information and scientific knowl- 
edge. Such institutions may be founded only with the knowledge 
and consent of the state.” 
It further held that “all public schools and educa- 
tional institutions are under the supervision of the 
state, and are at all times subject to its examination and 
inspection.” Moreover, teachers were not to be chosen 
without the consent of the state, and where their ap- 
pointment was not vested in particular persons, it was to 
belong to the state. Teachers of all secondary schools 
were to be regarded as state officials. No child was to be 
excluded from the schools because of his religion, nor 
compelled to stay for religious instruction when it differed 
from the belief in which he had been brought up.

DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN SCHOOL SYSTEMS 285 
This liberal and comprehensive code marked the cul- and marked 
mination of the attempts to establish a national non- the | culmina- 
sectarian system of education. It naturally met with sectarian sys 
opposition from the clergy and the ignorant masses, but “™ 
the system persisted and has continued to develop. For 
a time, under the well-intentioned, but weak Frederick 
William III. (7.1797-1840), however, the conservatism 
and corruption in government continued and the schools 
were neglected. The complete humiliation of Prussia in 
the battle of Jena (1806) and the treaty of Tilsit (1807), Tbe Mumia 
however, opened the eyes of that good-natured monarch sia in the 
to the need of universal education for the nation. It was et Ti 
then that he gave voice to that policy whose implied 
prophecy was so speedily fulfilled during the reign of his 
son, William I: 
“Although we have lost territory, power, and prestige, still we 
must strive to regain what we have lost by acquiring intellectual 
and moral power; and therefore it is my earnest desire and will to 
habilitate the nation by devoting most earnest attention to the 
education of the masses of my people.” 
In his efforts for a national system of education the _ 
king was stimulated and aided by his heroic queen Louise, Slated 
and by the patriotic songs of Arndt for the common peo- natured Fred- 
ple and the appeals of Fichte to the leaders in thought fr teturwe 
and action.1_ The reconstruction of the civil administra- efforts for * . . oe universal edu- 
tion was accompanied by a more centralized organization cation, and 
of the Prussian school system. The Oberschulcollegium . eral of 
was abolished, to get rid of the clerical domination that the Ober- 
had crept in, and a Bureau of Education was created as a pehulleg | 
section of the Department of the Interior (1807). Within placed by ra

scholarly philosopher, Von Humboldt, and his successor, 
Von Schuckman, national education was made a reality. 
Schools were held to exist for the state, to train religious 
and patriotic citizens, and much progress took place in 
the education of the masses. Great improvements were 
made in method and content, and a new spirit was intro- 
duced into the training of elementary teachers. A cor- 
responding advance was evident in secondary education. 
In order to teach in the gymnasiums, a strict examina- 
tion was instituted, and the work was given professional 
standing by withdrawing the privilege from ministerial 
candidates while waiting for a church position (1810). 
The ‘leaving examination’ for those graduating from 
the gymnasiums, which had been attempted by Zedlitz 
nearly a quarter of a century before (1788), was likewise 
revived, and all classical schools were forced to come to a 
uniform standard of attainment (1812). A commissioner 
was appointed to revise the course of study, and a com- 
prehensive Lehrplan was shortly published (1816), which 
pleased the new humanists by its emphasis upon Greek, 
and the realists and formal disciplinarians by the in- 
creased amount of mathematics. These reforms could 
not be effective at once, especially as competent teachers 
were lacking, but pedagogical seminaries, to train sec- 
ondary instructors, were eventually instituted at the uni- 
versities (1825), a ‘year of trial’ was demanded of all 
teachers (1826), and new requirements, including the 
main subjects taught in the secondary schools, together 
with philosophy, pedagogy, and theology, were intro- 
duced into the examination of gymnasial teachers (1831). 
A gymnasium leaving certificate also came to be required 
of candidates for the civil service, and for eligibility to

examination for admission to the learned professions 
(1834). 
The External Organization of the Prussian System.— 
Meanwhile, the Bureau of Education was erected 
into a separate department (1817).! Next the state 
was divided into educational provinces, and a Schul- 
collegium, or administrative board, with considerable 
independence, but subject to the minister, was es- 
tablished over each province (1825). This organiza- 
tion of the state system was further elaborated by the 
Prussian constitution of 1850 and by many educational 
acts* and ministerial decrees that have since become effec- 
tive. The provinces are now divided into ‘governments,’ 
each of which has a ‘school commission’ over it, and 
every government is divided into ‘districts,’ whose chief 
officer is a ‘school inspector.’ Under the district inspec- 
tor are local inspectors, and each separate school also has 
a local board, to take charge of repairs, supplies, and 
other external matters. The supreme management of the 
schools has thus been gradually coming into the hands of 
the state for nearly two centuries. ‘The decrees of 1717 
and 1763, the establishment of the Oberschulcollegium in 
1787, the General Code promulgated in 1794, the founda- 
tion of a Bureau of Education in 1807 and of a separate 
department in 1817, and the organization of educational 
provinces in'1825, are the milestones that mark the way 
to state control. But, while the influence of the church

has been constantly diminishing, it is still felt to some 
extent. Many of the board members are ministers or 
priests and the inspectors come mostly from the clergy. 
Moreover, religious instruction forms part of the course 
in every school, although it is given at such an hour that 
any pupil may withdraw if the teaching is contrary to the 
faith in which he has been reared. The secondary 
schools are largely interdenominational, but in elemen- 
tary education there are separate schools for Catholics 
and Protestants, alike supported by the state. 
The Volksschulen and the Mittelschulen—Prussia, 
like most of the principal states of Europe, as a result of 
their educational history,' has its elementary and second- 
ary schools quite separate and distinct. The universities 
continue the work of the gymnasiums and real-schools, 
but these two latter institutions parallel the work of the 
people’s schools rather than supplement it. The course 
of the secondary school ordinarily occupies the pupil 
from nine to eighteen years of age, while that of the ele- 
mentary school carries him from six to fourteen, and 
after the first three years it is practically impossible to 
transfer from the elementary to the secondary system. 
A pupil cannot enter a gymnasium or real-school after 
completing the people’s school, and the only further 
training he can obtain is that of a commercial, industrial, 
or ‘continuation school,’ ? which is not part of the system

2 These Fortbildungsschulen are sometimes held in the evening and even 
in a few instances on Sunday, but they are mostly conducted during the 
week in the daytime. They are not intended to review work previously 
done, but to treat some subjects already covered from the point of view 
of application to future vocational needs, and also to consider new sub- 
-jects that serve the same purpose.

proper. The people’s schools are gratuitous and are at- 
tended mostly by the children of the lower classes, while 
the gymnasiums charge a substantial tuition fee and 
are patronized by the professional classes and aristoc- 
racy. Hence the line between elementary and second- 
ary education in Prussia is longitudinal and not latitu- 
dinal, as it is in the United States; the distinction is 
one of wealth and social status rather than of educational 
grade and advancement. There are also some Mittelschu- There are alsa

the first real-school was opened in Berlin by Hecker 
(1747), this type of institution had only six years in its 
course, and was considered inferior to the gymnasium. 
The practical needs of the people were not regarded in 
secondary education, but only the ideal training of the 
ideal citizen. By the ministerial decree of 1859, however, 
two classes of real-schools were recognized. Those of 
the first class had a course of nine years, and included 
Latin, but not Greek. They were given full standing 
as secondary schools, and graduates were granted ad-

institution and making them identical as long as possible. 
In secondary schools of this new sort, French is usually 
the only foreign language taught for the first three years. 
Then the course divides, and one section takes up Latin 
and the other English. After two years more a further 
bifurcation takes place in the Latin section, and one group 
begins with the Greek, while the other studies Eng- 
lish. These institutions are known as Reformschulen 
and the plan was first introduced at Frankfort in 
1892.1 The ‘reform schools’ are now growing rapidly, 
and there is evident an increasing tendency to postpone 
the choice of courses as long as possible. The three 
years of training preliminary to admission to a secondary 
school of any type may be obtained through the people’s 
or the middle schools. But there has also grown up, as 
an attachment of the secondary schools, a Vorschule 
(‘preparatory school’), to perform this function for 
pupils of the more exclusive classes. 
The Universities—Like the other stages of educa- 
tion, the universities are now emancipated from ecclesias- 
tical control, and may be regarded as part of the national 
system of education. The university is now codrdinate 
and under the same authority with the church, for both 
are legally state institutions. Universities can, therefore, 
be established only by the state or with the approval 
‘of the state. In general, however, they are not controlled 
- by legislation, but through charters and special decrees 
of the minister of education. As their income from en- 
dowments and fees is very small, they are for the most

part supported by the state. They are managed inter- 
nally by the rector and senate. The rector is annually 
chosen from their own number by the full professors, 
with the approval of the minister, and the senate is a 
committee from the various faculties. The professors 
are regarded as civil servants with definite privileges, and 
they are appointed by the minister, although the sug- 
gestions of the faculty concerned are usually respected. 
The civic status of the universities is further shown in 
their being recognized by representation in the Diet 
or upper house of the legislature. 
Educational Institutions in France before the Revolu- 
tion—The development of a centralized system of 
education in France began almost a century later than in 
Germany. During the eighteenth and the early nine- 
teenth century the different monarchic powers were not 
at all favorable to training the masses, and popular 
education was badly neglected. It required several 
revolutions in government and the establishment of a 
permanent republic, to break the old traditions com- 
pletely, and to make it evident that universal suffrage 
should be accompanied by universal education. The 
- earlier educational history of France, however, was not 
radically different from that of Germany and the rest 
of western Europe. Thanks to the Renaissance and the 
efforts of such men as Budeus, Corderius, and Ramus, 
the anemic scholasticism and narrow theological dog- 
matism in the higher institutions were replaced in the 
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries by humanism and the 
study of the classic authors. A chair of Greek was es- 
tablished at the University of Paris (1458), and the 
College of France (1530) was founded by Francis I as a

protest and a means of permitting freedom in thought.! 
The Jesuit colleges, with their humanistic courses, be- 
gan to open (1540), and before the close of the century 
Henry IV undertook a reform of the university. Further 
broadening of higher and secondary education took 
place in the seventeenth century through the organiza- 
tion of the Oratorian and Port Royalist courses and 
the introduction of realism.2 Toward the close of this 
century also Rollin wrought his reformation of the 
university. After the middle of the eighteenth century 
the revolutionary spirit began to manifest itself. The 
Emile presented its successful protest against the arti- 
ficial education of the times (1762); the Jesuits were 
suppressed in France (1764); and, at the request of the 
Parliament of Paris, a general plan for a reorganization 
and centralization of education was presented by Rolland 
(1768). 
Educational Development since the French Revolu- 
tion—Up to this time little attention had been given 
to elementary education, except through a small number 
of parochial schools and the institutions established by 
the Institute of Christian Brethren in the seventeenth 
century.* But this plan of Rolland, while not adopted, © 
suggested; that relatively less should be expended for 
secondary education, and recommended universal educa- 
tion and an adequate number of training schools for 
teachers. The Constitutional Convention in 1793 was 
more destructive in its reforms, and abolished all the old 
educational organization, including the University of Paris

and the ‘colleges’ or secondary schools. Then followed 
the confusion of the revolutionary legislation. A large 
number of short-lived proposals and enactments were 
passed and repealed, but during this period of protest 
there were formulated great principles of educational 
administration and practice that were destined later to 
be embodied in more practical form and to rehabilitate 
French education upon a grander and more national 
scale. Each of the three revolutionary assemblies had 
its own scheme of popular education, put forward by 
Talleyrand, Condorcet, and Daunou respectively, but 
the first two plans never got beyond the paper stage, 
and the last (1795) was too loosely drawn to be carried 
‘ out. It did, however, introduce the influential concep- 
‘University of 
France.’ tion of ‘central schools,’ which were the only type of 
secondary education during the Revolution. The year 
before (1794) a system of department normal schools, 
with a great central normal at Paris, was also proposed 
but never really consummated.' 
After the Revolution, during the consulate of Napoleon 
(1802-1804), the ‘central schools’ were replaced. by the 
modern lycées, and the communal ‘colleges’ were recog- 
nized as secondary schools. When he had become em- 
peror, Napoleon went further with his educational reor- 
i, ganization, and ordered all the lycées, secondary colleges, 
and faculties of higher education to be united in a single 
corporation, dependent upon the state and known as the 
‘University. of France’ (1808). This decree of central- 
ization divided the country into twenty-seven admin- 
istrative districts, called ‘academies,’ each of which was

-P-A-G-E-313

to establish university faculties of letters and science 
near the principal lycées. For want of adequate support, 
these faculties were to borrow part of their instructional 
corps from the local lycées, and their chief function was 
to be the conferring of the degrees of bachelor, master 
(license), and doctor. This organization, however, did 
not include elementary education, and little attempt was 
made to provide for schools of this grade before the reign 
of Louis Philippe. Upon the advice of his great minister 
of education, Guizot, that monarch organized primary 
education, requiring a school for each commune, or at 
least for a group of two or three communes, and starting 
higher primary schools in the department capitals and in 
communes of over six thousand inhabitants (1833). He 
also instituted inspectors of primary. schools, and estab- 
lished department normal schools under the more effect- 
ive control of the state authorities. The plan for higher 
primary schools was never fully realized, and the institu- 
tions of this sort that had been established disappeared 
during the second empire. The reactionary law of Fal- 
loux (1850) did not even mention these schools, but en- 
couraged the development of denominational schools, and 
permitted teachers with scant qualifications to teach 
without further authorization than a bishop’s ‘letter of 
obedience.’ . 
The Primary School System.—Guizot, however, had 
given a permanent impulse to popular education, and 
during the third republic foundations for a national sys- 
tem of education have rapidly been laid. Schools have 
been brought into the smallest villages, new and conven- 
ient buildings have been erected, and elementary educa- 
tion has been made free to all (1881) and compulsory be- This organi-

tween the ages of six and thirteen (1882). To provide 
trained teachers, each department has been required to 
provide a normal school;! and two higher normals, one 
for men and one for women, to train teachers for the de- 
-partmental normal schools, have been opened by the 
state (z882).2 Secularization of the school system has 
; also gradually taken place. First, the courses of study 
were secularized by the substitution of civic and moral 
instruction for religious (1881); next, the instructional 
force was secularized by providing that members of the 
clergy should no longer be employed in the public schools 
(1886), and by recognizing public school teachers as 
state officers (1889); and finally, the schools themselves 
were completely secularized by compelling the teaching 
orders * to report to the state authorities (1902), and by 
afterward closing the free schools directed by them 
(1904). The higher primary schools have been reéstab- 
lished and extended (1898), and ‘supplementary courses’ 
offered for pupils remaining at the lower primary schools 
after graduation. The studies in the supplementary 
courses are technical, as well as general, and some of the 
higher primary schools have been established for voca- 
tional training rather than literary. In addition, there 
are continuation ‘schools of manual apprenticeship’ in 
the various communes, subsidized by the state for indus-

schools, and there are (1912) in all eighty-seven normals for boys and 
eighty-six for girls instead of ninety for each sex. ”

tively, and must be distinguished from the higher normal schools at Paris 
and Sévres, which prepare teachers for the secondary schools.

trial and agricultural education, and five large schools for 
training in special crafts have been organized in Paris. 
Institutions for children between two and six years of age 
became part of the primary system in the days of Guizot 
(1833), and half a century later the present name, écoles 
maternelles,s was adopted (1881), although there have 
since been marked reforms made in the curriculum. 
There are also ‘infant classes’ for pupils from five to 
seven years of age. These theoretically form a sep- 
arate stage of training between the maternal and the 
lower primary schools, but are, as a matter of fact, ugu-" 
ally attached to one or the other. Thus within a genera- 
tion universal elementary education has been established 
in France and brought completely under state control. 
The Lycées and Communal Colleges.—As in Prussia, 
the secondary school system of France does not connect i 
with the primary, but is quite separate and distinct. The } 
training has, since the time of Napoleon, been furnished a 
chiefly by the lycées and communal colleges. During the 
Restoration (1814-1830) and the reign of Louis Philippe 
(1830-1848) the lycées were known as ‘royal colleges,’ 
but, with the advent of the second republic (1848-1851), i 
the old name was restored and the curricula were com- 
pletely reorganized. By this revision some elasticity 
was introduced into the last three years of the lycée by a 
bifurcation into a literary and a scientific course, and dur- 
ing the third republic further elections and much modern 
material have been incorporated. The Jatest revision 
(zg02) has resulted in the establishment of four courses,— 
the Latin-Greek, the Latin-modern language, the Latin- 
science, and the science-modern language. The curric-

ulum is divided into two ‘cycles,’—the first of four, and 
the second of three years, and it is during the second 
largely that the differentiation takes place.1 In the lead. 
ing lycées and colleges special preparation is also afforded 
for schools like the military institution of St. Cyr or the 
Polytechnic of Paris, and in some there is a short.course 
of three or four years in modern languages and sciences 
that in function closely approaches that of the German 
Realschulen. The boys ordinarily begin the first cycle 
of the lycée or college at ten years of age, and while 
they may transfer from the primary system at this 
stage, in most lycées and colleges there are preparatory 
classes to train the pupil from six to ten. Education in a 
lycée or college is not gratuitous, but the income from 
tuition fees is so small as to cover but a small fraction of 
the cost, and the rest is contributed by the state. The 
communal colleges differ from the lycées in being local, 
(whereas the latter are considered national), and they 
are maintained by the communes, as well as the state. 
They have not the same standing, and the same attain- 
ments are not required of their professors. Until 1880 
there were no lycées and communal colleges for girls, 
and convents and private schools furnished the only 
means of female education. Even now the course in the 
public secondary institutions for girls is two years shorter 
than in those for boys, although some of the more im- 
portant furnish an extra year for students preparing for

of thought, and a dozen other institutions of uni- 
versity grade, connected with some special line, have 
been established. 
Administration of the French System of Education.— 
The centralization of education is more complete in 
France than in the United States or even Germany. 
The control of the schools is not vested in a number of 
individual states, but is assumed by the national govern- 
ment itself.. The supreme head of the system is the 
minister of education. He is immediately assisted by 
three directors, one for each of the three departments,— 
primary, ‘secondary, and higher education, and by a 
director of accounts, who has charge of all expenditures. 
All three departments contain several bureaus, each of 
which’ has special functions. A rector is in charge of 
each of the ‘academies,’ except Paris, where the minister 
nominally holds the office and a vice rector performs 
the duties. The rector has authority over all three 
fields of education in his department, but does not appoint 
the teachers. This office is performed by the prefect, 
or civil head of each department, upon the recommenda- 
tion of the academy inspector. There is also a depart- 
mental council, which is presided over by the prefect, 
and consists of general counsellors, teachers, and in- 
spectors. It appoints the delegates of each canton, who 
take charge of the school premises and equipment,

and determine the number and location of the primary 
schools, the number of teachers, and the penalties to be 
exacted of them, in case of misconduct. Further organ- 
ization is effected through the maintenance of a complete a corns of in 
corps of general, academy, and primary inspectors. 
Thus the French educational administration is the most 
thoroughly centralized of all modern nations. 
English Education before the Nineteenth Century.— 
In England the nationalization and universalizing of 
education were delayed even longer than in France. 
This country was never controlled by enlightened despots, 
who could, as in Germany, anticipate and force the 
growth of public educational sentiment, nor was it over- 
whelmed by the sweep of a great revolution, destroying, 
as in France, all opposition to popular progress. The 
development of national education in England has National ed- : ucation in 
gradually grown out of the conflict of a number of England has 
elements represented in its society. It has been the omy evolved a 
product of a series of compromises among many different series of com- 
factors,—the church, state, economic conditions, private POmeste 
enterprise, and philanthropy. While such a process of cements io 
educational evolution seems exceedingly slow, and the ° 
resulting system is based upon practical sense rather 
than upon any well-considered theory or plan, it has not 
been subject to serious retrogression or abrupt change. 
Throughout the nineteenth century there was some at- 
tempt to weld together the various conflicting forces 
into a national system, but until late in this period the 
feeling prevailed that the state was not responsible for 
education. This function was regarded as belonging 
to the church and family, and the growing sentiment for 
universal education was retarded in its enactment into

law by the attitude of the House of Lords, which, fo 
the most part, stgove to keep the poor in ignorance and 
to maintain the authority of the established church. 
The medieval monopoly of the church remained even | 
after the Anglican Reformation, for the schoolmasters 
were then licensed and controlled by the bishops of the 
Church of England, just as they had formerly been by 
the Roman episcopate.1_ The sway of formal humanism 
in secondary and higher education also became complete.? 
This domination in administration and content was 
first challenged in the seventeenth century, when the 
struggles of the Dissenters began,* and the period of 
realism developed with Bacon, Mulcaster, Milton, Hart- 
lib, and Locke.* In the eighteenth century established 
authorities were even further questioned. Although 
court and parliamentary decisions still generally held that 
the bishops had power over elementary, as well as second- 
ary education, this became a period of preparation for the 
activities in nationalizing education that appeared dur- 
ing the nineteenth century. Except for the meager 
training furnished through the Society for the Promo- 
tion of Christian Knowledge, the Sunday schools, and

the last of the eighteenth century there began to appear 
a new point of view, especially among philosophers, ju- 
rists, reformers, and economists, like Bentham, Black- 
stone, Robert Owen, and Adam Smith, who advocated 
universal education, compulsory attendance, and a na- 
tional system of schools. 
Movements in the Nineteenth Century Leading to the 
Act of 1870-—The theory of these great thinkers was 
somewhat in advance of the times, but, early in the 
nineteenth century, social changes in the way of liberty Barly in, the 
in thought and speech and of industrial improvement century va- 
began to favor better educational opportunities. The 12s socal

it was often evaded by masters and mistresses, it became and a ame 
an important precedent. Five years later came Mr. formation

defeated by the lords on the ground that it took education Brougham. 
‘out of the superintendence and control of the clergy.’ 
The contest, however, was reopened in 1815 by Henry 
Brougham. While that reformer lost his bill in 1820, 
he had previously secured a commission of inquiry on 
popular education (1816) and one on endowed schools 
(1878), and a large mass of information was thus collected 
that greatly contributed to the final success of universal . 
education. In 1832, the passage of a reform bill, which ope ccension 
largely increased the suffrage, aroused parliament to aroused pil 
the need of educating the masses, and the next year the 1855 to grant 
first parliamentary grant, £20,000, was made for ele- £2.00 for

1870 was the appointment in 1858 of a royal commission 
to inquire into the state of popular education. As the 
result of its findings, the bill of Robert Lowe was passed In :86:, upc 
in 1861 to establish ‘payment by results,’ that is, to Seudston « 
base the grant to any school upon the results shown by * a 
the pupils in the governmental examinations. This education, . 
method was intended to increase efficiency, but, used Pit fo a 
as the sole means of testing, it soon proved narrowing by results! 
and unfair, and had to be supplemented by the general" mee 
opinion formed of the school by the inspectors. 
‘Board Schools’ and their Development since 1870— 
When the franchise was further extended in 1868, Af further ¢ 
Mr. Lowe exhorted his fellow liberals: “Let us educate sufitage led t 
our new masters.” This necessity of preparing millions ne on 
of the common people for new responsibilities and au- establishing 
thority in public affairs led in 1870 to the passage of the gchoots’ sup 
epoch-making bill of William E. Forster. Under this act pore . 
‘board schools,’ or institutions ‘in charge of a board grants and lo 
chosen by the people of the community, were to be es- cal anne 
tablished wherever a deficiency in the existing accom- ting the ‘vol 
modations required it.1 The ‘voluntary,’ or denomi- way, to 
national schools, most of which belonged to the Church oar at 
of England, were to share in the government grants grants. 
upon equal terms with the new institutions, but the 
latter had also the benefit of local ‘rates.’ Elementary 
instruction in all schools had to be open to government 
inspection, and the amount of the grant was partly 
determined by the report of the inspectors. The board 
? The act resulted in the establishment of some fifteen hundred new 
‘voluntary schools,’ as before any ‘board schools’ could be established, 
six months were allowed for the deficiencies to be supplied by private 
means,

schools were forbidden to allow “any religious catechism 
or religious formulary, which is distinctive of any par 
ticular denomination”; and religious instruction in either 
type of school had to be placed at the beginning or end 
of the school session, so that, under the ‘conscience 
clause’ of the act, any scholar might conveniently with- 
draw at that time. 
This act of 1870 was, of course, the magna charia 
of national education, and has become the basis of much 
school legislation since that time. The compromise 
in the bill that allowed the voluntary schools, with their » 
sectarian instruction, to continue receiving government’ 
support, has, however, prevented a logical and consistent 
system from being established. The struggle to complete 
the nationalization of the schools has lasted until the 
present, and meanwhile the dual system of elementary 
schools has continued to be developed in a variety of 
enactments. Compulsory attendance laws were passed 
(1876, 1880), and the minimum age of exemption was 
set first at eleven years of age, and then raised to twelve 
(x893, 1899). An extra grant, to take the place of tuition 
fees (1891), soon made it possible for most schools to 
become absolutely free. A still more advanced step 
toward a national system of schools was taken by the 
creation of a central ‘Board of Education’ (1899). This 
body assumed the functions of the Committee of Privy 
Council on Education, which had been providing for the 
elementary schools and for science and art instruction; 
of the Charity Commissioners, who were reorganizing 
the educational trusts and endowments; and of the 
Board of Agriculture. The act also provided for a ‘con- 
sultative committee,’ to represent the views of the uni-
-P-A-G-E-325
a DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN SCHOOL SYSTEMS 307 
versities and other bodies interested in education, and 
advise the board on any question referred to it. In. 
addition to its control of the elementary institutions, 
the board was authorized “to inspect any school supply- 
ing secondary education and desiring to be inspected.” 
\ The Education Act of 1902.—The next important 
movement toward centralization took place in 1902. 
The board schools had in their generation of existence 
met with a phenomenal growth, and the voluntary schools 
could no longer compare with them. The former had 
come to include about seventy per cent of the pupils, 
and were doing a splendid work, especially for the con- 
centrated population in great industrial communities. 
They weré spending about half as much again upon 
each pupil as were the voluntary schools, since the sub- 
scriptions, endowments, and tuition fees of the latter 
could not keep pace with the local rates, and the board 
schools were able to engage a much better staff of teachers. 
This extension of civil influence in education was bitterly 
opposed. by the established church, and when the con- 
servatives came into power through the assistance of 
the clergy (x895), they were pledged to secure better 
maintenance for the voluntary schools. Such a pro- 
vision they at first attempted to obtain through a special 
government grant (1897), but this proved inadequate, 
and they then passed the act of 1902, whereby the 
denominational schools were permitted to share in the 
local rates.. The administration of both board and volun- 
tary schools was now centralized in the county councils, 
except in the case of cities and large boroughs, which 
were given independent control through their own 
councils. But the immediate supervision of instruction, The devel-

elementary ‘schools have been considered as part of 
one comprehensive system, and the board schools have 
been distinguished as ‘provided schools’ and the volun- 
tary as ‘nonprovided.’ Under the legislation of 1902 
steps were also taken to codrdinate secondary with 
elementary education, and bring. it somewhat within 
the public system. The board schools had early in their 
existence begun to develop upward into secondary 
education and before long had come to compete with 
the older grammar and public schools. In 1900, however, 
the grants of the science and art department were with- 
drawn from the support of secondary education in board 
schools, the ‘Cockerton judgment’ forbade the use of 
local rates for other instruction than elementary, and 
fifteen yedrs of age was fixed by the Board of Education 
as the upper limit for’ pupils in the board schools. Thus 
secondary training was excluded from public adminis- 
tration, but, in keeping with the agreement to deal “not 
with secondary education or with primary education 
 
-P-A-G-E-327
Et DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN SCHOOL SYSTEMS 309 
in their isolation, but with both in one measure,” the 
Act of 1902 imposed upon councils the duty to support 
instruction in subjects beyond the elementary work. 
The Board of Education was also empowered to pass 
judgment upon the work of the great public schools 
and other endowed secondary institutions, and to allow 
grants to all schools meeting the conditions of the Board, 
as determined by the reports of the government inspectors. 
Even since the liberals returned to power, they have 
continued the conservatives’ policy of granting local 
rates to all elementary schools, of bringing secondary 
education under public support and control, and of 
making the county and city councils the unit of school 
administration, with the national Board of Education 
as a unifying force in the entire field. While the education 
bill of 1906, which was kept from passage by the House of 
Lords, did not recognize church schools as such, and 
insisted upon bringing them under the complete control 
of the public authorities, it made no attempt to return 
to the former dual system of schools and the isolation 
of secondary from elementary education. It still held 
also to religious, and, under safeguards, even to sectarian 
instruction in the elementary schools, and, with the 
recent readjustment of the power of the House of Lords 
(1911), it may yet be passed in a revised form. A volun- 
tary committee for a ‘resettlement in English elementary 
education,’ through the mediation of the President of 
the Board of Education and the Archbishop of Canter- 
bury, has been at work for half a dozen years formulat- 
ing a modus vivendi acceptable to both sides. Their 
plan concedes the principle of public control and support 
for all elementary schools and religious freedom for teach- The Act of 
1902, how- 
ever, required 
the councils 
to support in-

ers and pupils, but provides local option for the contin- 
uance of denominational schools. Thus, while England 
is not prepared to adopt a secular system, like that! 
of France and the United States, and has not yet 
articulated all its secondary education with elementary, 
it is upon the high road to a complete centralization of 
school administration in the national government. 
During the nineteenth century the classical and 
ecclesiastical monopoly in higher education was also 
broken. A recognition of the scientific and industrial 
ideals began to appear in the curriculum of Cambridge 
(1851) and Oxford (1853), and the theological require- 
ments for a degree were dropped (1856). By the last 
quarter of the century actual workshops and laboratories 
had been introduced, and students were freed from all 
doctrinal tests at both universities. Moreover, new 
universities, better adjusted to modern demands and 
more closely related to the school systems and the civil 
government, began to arise in manufacturing centers. 
Since 1889 such institutions as the Universities of Birm- 
ingham, Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, and Bristol 
have sprung up as the product of private benefactions, 
municipal enterprise, and parliamentary subsidy, and 
the University of London, started as an examining body 
in 1836, was made a teaching institution in 1900. 
- ‘Types of Education in the Dominion of Canada.— 
The state systems of schools which have grown up in the 
Canadian provinces approach those of the United States 
muck more closely than do those of the European nations. 
Yet they are sufficiently distinctive and important to 
deserve description and to offer suggestions to the older 
countries. Canada developed schools in very early

days. In the beginning education was cared for in the 
four provinces separately, and when the Dominion of 
Canada was finally formed (1867), the federal govern- 
ment left to each province the administration of public 
education within its borders. The same autonomy was 
extended to the provinces that have since been admitted 
to the federation. Two types of educational control,— 
state and ecclesiastical, have been developing from the 
first. The former method is best illustrated by the 
system of public schools, with grants of public funds, 
that has been organized in Ontario; and the latter by the 
public supervision of parochial schools that has been 
established in Quebec. Ontario was settled mostly by 
English and Scotch emigrants, many of whom had, as 
‘union loyalists,’ come from the United States after the 
Declaration of Independence, and practically all the 
_ colonists had brought with them the concept of public 
control of education. The French settlers of Quebec, on 
the other hand, naturally followed their traditions of 
parish schools. 
The Public School System of Ontario.——The system 
of schools in Ontario began before the middle of the 
nineteenth century. As early as 1841 the provincial 
parliament provided for the establishment of township 
‘common schools’ and for district ‘grammar schools’ 
after the English type of secondary education. Two 
years later the college at York, now relocated and known 
as the ‘University of Toronto,’ opened its doors. Then, 
in 1846, through Egerton Ryerson, the Common Schools 
Act for Ontario was passed. This was formulated after 
a careful study of the systems of Massachusetts, New 
York, and the European states, and it included many In the Cana-

    excellent elements from various systems and a num 
of valuable original features. Through tenure of offi 
during thirty years, Dr. Ryerson was able to develo 
and fix this system, and the Ontario law of 1871, aft 
the Dominion had been formed, included free tuitio’ 
compulsory attendance, county inspection, unifo 
examinations, and all the other features for which he ha 
contended. 
Since 1876 an even greater centralizatio 
vincial system has been effected througl 
for the chief superintendent a ‘minister | 
with much larger powers, and bringing 
public education,—the elementary, sec 
higher schools, into much closer relationship. ‘lhe min 
ister has many assistants and advisors, including since 
1906 an Advisory Council of Education, which i: 
up of representatives from the universities and 
schools, the inspectional corps, and local truste: 
initiates and directs all school legislation, decides com- 
plaints and disputes, sets examinations for the high, 
elementary, model, and normal schools, prescribes the 
courses of study, chooses the text-books, and appoints 
the inspectors. His is an office of great power and dig- 
nity. The system is also administered by subordinate 
authorities elected in the localities, whose duties are 
clearly defined by law. The province is for educational 
purposes divided into counties, which are in turn divided 
, into townships, and subdivided into sections and incor- 
porated cities, towns, and villages. The central and 
local administrations are wisely balanced, and while the 
one determines scholastic standards through its profes- 
sional requirements, the other establishes schools, ap-

points teachers, and regulates expenditures under thé 
general control of the minister. The system of elemen- 
tary schools, high schools, collegiate institutes, and 
universities, is fully unified, and the work of each stage 
fits into the others even more exactly than in the ‘ladder’ 
system of the United States. The training of teachers 
is cared for through the departments of Education in 
the universities, the eight provincial normal schools, 
and a model school in each county. The teachers for 
secondary institutions are prepared at the universities, 
the normal schools grant a life certificate to teach in the 
elementary schools, while the model schools afford four- 
teen weeks of training for country teachers. The build- 
ings, equipment, courses, and instruction of the high, 
elementary, and model schools are each reported upon 
by inspectors of assured scholarship and experience. 
Since 1863 permission has been granted to establish 
‘separate schools’ for any peculiar creed.or race, where- 
ever there are five families requesting it. This opportu- 
nity to have schools of their own faith has not been 
embraced by any save the Roman Catholics. Any one 
paying toward the support of a ‘separate school’ is ex- 
empt from taxation for the regular public schools. Spe- 
cial provincial inspectors report upon these schools, but 
in the same way as for the public schools. An effort 
has frequently been made to get rid of this provision by 
instituting purely secular schools throughout the prov- 
ince, but it has never been successful, and even in the 
public schools nonsectarian religious exercises are still 
conducted.

A HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
    ae, Ontario ional administration in the various provinces of 
typical of all Canada, except Quebec. While each province has a 
Porn ee history and peculiarities of its own, many of the features 
in them all have been taken from the Ontario model. 
Every one has sought uniformity of school provision 
and educational standards through government control, 
although none of them grant their central official as 
much power as Ontario. In Nova Scotia, Manitoba, 
and British Columbia the ‘executive council’ consti- 
tutes the educational authority of the province, and the 
chief officer, known as ‘superintendent,’ is appointed 
by the lieutenant governor. New Brunswick vests the 
authority in a Board of Education, composed of the 
lieutenant governor, the members of the executive coun- 
cil, the president of the provincial university, and the 
superintendent, who is secretary and chief executive. 
Alberta and Saskatchewan permit ‘separate schools,’ 
and they existed in Manitoba until 1890, when, after a 
bitter contest, they were abolished. 
But the ecclesiastical type of control in Quebec is 
very different from that of the other provinces. The 
educational system originated there in the schools of the 
parishes and of the teaching orders, like the Jesuits and 
which has a Christian Brethren, and in 1845 the parish was by law 
central feut" made the unit of school administration. But seven years 
Instruction, Jater government inspectors were established, and in with two divi- ae . . 
sions—a 1859 a central organization was completed with a Council 
Catholic, ane of Public Instruction. This authority is composed of two 
each of which divisions, a Roman Catholic and a Protestant, which sit

achools of its creeds. Each division makes regulations for the in- 
om struction and texts of its own schools, and appoints in-

spectors of its own faith. The provincial superintendent 
| of schools, appointed: by the lieutenant governor, is ex 
oficio chairman of both divisions, but he can vote only 
with the division to which he belongs by religion. The 
proceeds from the general public school fund, a special 
tax, or any educational legacies are divided in propor- 
tion to the Catholic and Protestant inhabitants, but the 
regular school rate of one-fifth cent on a dollar may be 
assigned to whichever of the two school systems the tax- 
payer wishes. The local unit in education is the mu- 
nicipality, which may be divided into districts, and the 
trustees in each district have full control of the schools 
| there, subject to the requirements of the Council.

| Comparison of Modern School Systems.—Thus, dur- 
ing the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, systems of 
education have been centralized in the civil governments 
of the leading European nations and of Canada. With 
the exception of the Canadian provinces, however, no 
one of these states has yet altogether welded its primary 
and secondary systems.! Moreover, while France alone 
has been completely centralized and rendered purely 
‘secular, all the others have been liberated from ecclesi- 
" astical control and are under civic organization and 
management. This development represents a very dif- 
ferent situation from the conditions in the administra- 
tion of schools that furnished America with its first edu- 
cational traditions, but the evolution of state control 
in the United States took place quite independently of 
‘that in Europe. In fact, until the early part of the nine- 
\ teenth century, so little was known in America concern- 
; ing European education that adaptations to the systems

of natural 
sciences dur-

THE MODERN SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT 
The Development of the Natural Sciences in Modern 
‘Times.—The germ of the modern tendency to introduce 
the natural sciences into the content of education was 
apparent as early as Rousseau. The Emile, on its con- 
structive side, may be held to advocate the scientific, 
as well as the sociological and psychological ‘movements 
in modern times. Some description has been given in 
previous chapters of the consequent efforts to improve 
the ideals, organization, and methods of education in 
accordance with our modern knowledge of society and 
the mental development of the individual, and we may 
now turn to a more specific consideration of the gradual 
expansion of the course of study and of the, modern 
scientific movement. Such a tendency has constituted 
one phase of the remarkable growth of natural science 
during the past two centuries. This rapid movement 
can best be understood by recalling the development of 
society and education at the times. Science started to 
develop back in the time of Roger Bacon, but even 
during the Renaissance it was bitterly opposed, because 
of the tendency to conflict with religious dogma, although 
this age did not object to the revival of the classics. 
Accordingly, the latter became strongly intrenched in 
educational tradition, and became the most obstinate 
opponent of the sciences. Its numerous representatives 
320
-P-A-G-E-339
THE MODERN SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT 325 
struggled hard to keep the sciences out of education. 
But toward the close of the seventeenth century, with 
the growth of reason and the removal of the theological 
ban, the scientific movement, which had been held back 
so long, began to make a rapid advance. 
How extensive this development was, can scarcely 
be appreciated without a brief enumeration of the marvel- 
lous discoveries and inverttions that have been called into 
being since the eighteenth century began. For more 
than a millennium the Greek developments in astronomy 
had been accepted as final, but in the course of the seven- 
teenth century these dicta were completely upset by 
the revelations of Copernicus, Tycho Brahé, Kepler, 
and Galileo. The work of these investigators paved 
the way for the formulation of universal gravitation 
and the laws of motion by Isaac Newton, which united 
the universe into a single comprehensive system and 
completed the foundations for modern mechanics. About 
the same time the other great development in science 
among the Grecks,—anatomy and physiology, was 
completely revolutionized through Harvey’s discovery 
of the double circulation of the blood and the microscopic 
demonstration by Malpighi of the existence of capil- 
laries connecting the veins and the arteries. From these 
days on the desire for scientific investigation steadily 
grew until, during the nineteenth century, its ideals, 
methods, and results became patent in every department 
of human knowledge. The strongholds of ignorance, 
superstition, and prejudice were rapidly stormed and 
taken through new discoveries or new marshallings 
of facts already discovered. But it will be quite impos-

sible here to do more than mention a few of the more 
important scientific achievements and outline the broad 
sweep of progress in the nineteenth century. In astron- 
omy the Newtonian theory was confirmed by the inves- 
tigations of Lagrange and Laplace (1785) and by the 
discovery of Neptune through purely mathematical rea- 
soning from the effects of its gravitation (1845). After 
the middle of the century, when chemistry had been more 
fully developed, innumerable celestial discoveries were 
made through the spectroscope and astral photography. 
Owing to more complicated phenomena and the opposi- 
tion of theologians to disturbing the Biblical chronology, 
the progress in geology was slower. Yet during the 
century were established Hutton’s ‘Plutonic’ theory of 
the origin of continents and islands, Lyell’s ‘uniformi- 
tarian’ doctrine that past changes in the earth were like 
the present in degree and kind, and Agassiz’s hypothesis 
of a universal ice-age. Paleontology also arose during 
the century, and Cuvier, Lyell, and other prominent 
investigators proved, by means of the fossils, that the 
earth had known successive rotations of population and 
countless zons of time. Despite Lyell’s inconsistent 
advocacy of ‘special creation,’ these discoveries strength- 
ened the conception of evolution in biology. Early in 
the century Lamarck formulated his transmutation of 
species through ‘accumulated and inherited use.” But 
this was displaced by the influential theory of ‘natural 
selection,’ made public by Darwin and Wallace half 
a century later, although the Lamarckian ‘inheritance of 
acquired characteristics,’ tacitly held also by Darwin, 
remained in dispute between the Neolamarckians and 
the followers of Weissmann. Much was contributed
-P-A-G-E-341
THE MODERN SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT 323 
to the theory of inheritance by Galton and Mendel, 
while Pasteur and Tyndall thoroughly disposed of ‘spon- 
taneous generation.’ Physiology and other more special 
phases of biology met with a similar advance. Bichat 
showed the existence of the two sets of processes,—voli- 
tional and non-volitional, in every vertebrate, and reduced 
all animal structures to a few types of tissue. Lister 
settled the question as to the form of the red corpuscles 
in the blood. Through the development of microscopy, 
numerous important discoveries were made in minute 
anatomy, which gave rise to histology as an independ- 
ent science. Embryology also became established as a 
separate science, and proved of great importance in 
developing the ‘cell theory.’ This concept was first 
formulated by Schwann (1839), and, in the modified 
form given it by Virchow and others (1860), became the 
central generalization of physiology. About the same 
time, the researches of Liebig and others brought phys- 
iology within’ the province of chemistry, and, taken in 
connection with the cell theory, the greatest light was 
shed upon the action of the saliva, the stomach, and the 
gastric juice in digestion, and upon the functioning of 
the lungs and liver. Contemporaneous with all these 
discoveries in geology and biology was an epochal 
development of the physical sciences. Early in the 
century Dalton’s rain-gauge and the study of evapora- 
tion led to the theory of ‘atoms,’ on which is based the 
structure of modern chemistry, and in 1811 Avogadro 
proposed that the compound atom be denominated 
‘molecule.’ During the first decade also Young for- 
mulated the wave theory of light, which postulates the 
existence of ‘ether’ through all space. This theory physiology,

made matter and energy the fundamental concepts for 
modern physics, and has been invaluable in the study 
of radiant energy and the constitution of matter.1 As 
an indirect result of it, the doctrine of the ‘conserva- 
tion of energy’ was demonstrated by Joule and Mayer, 
the supplementary theory of the ‘dissipation of energy’ 
was formulated by Lord Kelvin, and atomic and molec- 
ular conceptions were greatly advanced. The ‘periodic 
law’ of the recurrence of similar properties, when the 
chemical ‘elements’ were arranged in order of their 
atomic weights, was formulated by Newlands (1864), 
and three new elements were shortly discovered, to fit 
into the existing series (1880). 
The Growth of Inventions and Discoveries in the 
Nineteenth Century.—It should be noted that the 
majority of these investigations were for a long time 
carried on outside the universities, and, owing to the 
almost proverbial conservatism of educational institu- 
tions, the natural sciences scarcely entered the course 
of study anywhere. In fact, these great discoveries at 
first seem not to have affected practical life in any 
direction. Huxley? tells us: 
. 
“The progress of science, during the first century after Bacon’s 
death, by no means verified his sanguine prediction of the fruits 
which it would yield... . Weaving and spinning were carried 
on with the old appliances; nobody could travel faster by sea or by 
land than at any previous time in the world’s history, and King 
George could send a message from London to York no faster than 
King John might have done.” . 
1%t has also led to many new discoveries and inventions, such as 
wireless telegraphy and the practical applications of X-rays in medicine.

“But a little later,” he adds, “that growth of knowl- 
edge beyond imaginable utilitarian ends, which is the con- 
dition precedent of its practical utility, began to produce 
some effect upon practical life.” The nineteenth century 
will, on this account, always be known for its develop- 
ment of inventions and the arts, as well as of pure science. 
During this period science rapidly grew and took the form 
of applications to the problems of labor, production, 
transportation, communication, hygiene, and sanitation. 
The invention of the cotton gin (1792), the reaping ma- 
chine (1834), the vulcanization of rubber (1837), the 
sewing machine (1846), the cylinder printing press (1847), 
and the typewriter (1868) greatly reduced the cost o 
labor, increased the amount of production, and made 
new industries possible. By the use of anthracite (1812), 
the introduction of friction matches (1837), and illumi- 
nation through petroleum (1853) and incandescent 
electricity (1879), the conveniences and comforts of during the

improved by the screw propeller (1839) and the steam 
turbine (1884), and the locomotive (1830) linked all 
parts of the world together. The telegraph (1837), 
the submarine cable (1842), the telephone (1876), and 
wireless telegraphy (1897) made communication between 
all places almost instantaneous. Warfare became in- 
finitely more destructive and unprofitable through such 
inventions as the gatling gun (2861) and smokeless 
powder (1895). The invention of the stethoscope (1819), 
the production of anzsthesia through the medium of 
nitrous oxide (1844), sulphuric ether (1846), and chloro- 
form (1847), the perfection of antiseptic surgery (1867), 
and the discovery of inoculations for hydrophobia

diseases contributed largely to the progress of hu- 
manity. 
Herbert Spencer and What Knowledge is of Most 
Worth.—Because of these practical results, the vital 
importance of a knowledge of natural phenomena to 
human welfare and social progress was more and more 
felt throughout the century. It gradually became evi- 
dent that the natural sciences were demanded by modern 
life and constituted elements of the greatest value in 
modern culture and education. The German reformers, 
such as Pestalozzi, Herbart, and Froebel, have already 
been seen to oppose the prevailing education on the 
ground that the doctrine of formal discipline was un- 
psychological. But opposition was also offered upon 
the score of content, rather than method, by many 
English and American writers, who maintained that 
an exclusive study of the classics did not provide a 
suitable preparation for life. As the content of the 
sciences became more fully systematized, many promi- 
nent persons began to insist upon their inclusion in the 
curriculum. This step was bitterly opposed by conser- 
vative institutions and educators. During a greater 
part of the century a contest was waged between the 
advocates of the classical monopoly, with their argu- 
ments for formal training, and the progressives who 
urged that the sciences should be introduced and that 
the main emphasis in education should be upon content. 
Advocacy of the new subject matter appeared in trea- 
tises on education by various scientists. The represent- 
ative argument for sciences in the course of study was 
that made by Herbert Spencer (1820-1903) in his essay
-P-A-G-E-345
THE MODERN SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT 327 
on What Knowledge Is of Most Worth.1 Spencer was the 
descendant of educators, and during all his youth was 
surrounded by intellectual and literary traditions. He 
never went to the university, possibly on account of 
poor health, from which he suffered all his life, but he 
read deeply at home on natural science and mathematics, 
performed experiments and made inventions, and showed 
remarkable ability in working out original problems. 
A monumental series of works, including his ideas on 
education, was issued by him. Spencer did not read 
widely upon educational subjects, and, while he was 
somewhat affected by the atmosphere of the times, 
his conceptions were largely his own. He ventured to 
raise the whole question of the purpose of education, 
and was completely subversive of the old classical tradi- 
tions. His clear exposition and his convincing logic 
have brought a wide currency and great influence to 
his work. His discussion runs as follows: 
“In order of time decoration precedes dress. And in our univer- 
sities and schools at the present moment the like antithesis holds. 
As the Orinoco Indian puts on his paint before leaving his hut, not 
with a view to any direct benefit, but because he would be ashamed 
to be seen without it; so a boy’s drilling in Latin and Greek is 
insisted on, not because of their intrinsic value, but that he may 
not be disgraced by being found ignorant of them. The compara- 
tive worths of different kinds of knowledge have been as yet 
scarcely even discussed—much less discussed in a methodic way 
with definite results. Before there can be a rational curriculum, 
we must decide which things it most concerns us to know. To this 
end, a measure of value is the first requisite. How to live?—that is 
the essential question for us. Not how to live in the mere material 
sense only, but in the widest sense. To prepare us for complete

who holds 
that the func- 
tion of edu- 
cation is ‘to 
ffepare for 
complete liv- 
ing,’ , 
and that the 
sciences com- 
pose the

for this pur- 
pose. 328 A HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
living is the function which education has to discharge; and th 
only rational mode of judging of any educational course is, t 
judge in what degree it discharges such function. Our first ste; 
must obviously be to classify, in the order of their importance, th 
Jeading kinds of activity which constitute human life. They ma; 
be arranged into: x. Those activities which direc**- ~*-*-*-- + 
self-preservation; 2. Those activities which; by 
necessaries of life, indirectly minister to self-preserv 
activities which have for their end the rearing au wows vy 
offspring; 4. Those activities which are involved in the main-| 
tenance of proper social and political relations; 5. Those miscel- 
laneous activities which make up the leisure part of life, devoted! 
to the gratification of the tastes and feelings. We do not mean 
that these divisions are definitely separable. We do not deny 
that they are intrinsically entangled with each other in such way 
that there can be no training for any that is not in some measure 
a trairiing for all. Nor do we question that of each division there 
are portions more important than certain portions of the preceding 
divisions. But after making all qualifications, there still remain 
these broadly marked divisions; and these divisions subordinate 
one another in the foregoing order. The ideal of education is 
complete preparation in all these divisions. But failing this ideal, 
as in our phase of civilization every one must do more or less, the 
aim should be to maintain a due proportion between the degrees of 
preparation in each, greatest where the value is greatest, less where 
the value is less, least where the value is least.” 
Applying this test, Spencer finds that a knowledge of 
the sciences is always most useful in life, and therefore 
of most worth. He considers each one of the five groups 
of activities and demonstrates the need of the knowledge 
of some science or sciences to guide it rightly. An ac- 
quaintance with physiology is necessary to the main- 
tenance of health, and so for self-preservation; any form 
of industry or other means of indirect self-preservation 
will require some understanding of mathematics, physics,
-P-A-G-E-347
nn t,t 
  THE MODERN SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT - 329 
chemistry, biology, and sociology; to care for the physi- 
cal, intellectual, and moral training of their children, 
parents should know the general principles of physiology, 
psychology, and ethics; a man is best fitted for citizen- 
ship through a knowledge of the science of history in its 
political, economic, and social aspects; and even the 
esthetic or leisure side of life depends upon physiology, 
mechanics, and psychology as a basis for art, music and 
poetry, and “science opens up realms of poetry where 
to the unscientific all is a blank.” 
Hence Spencer advocates a complete change from the 
type of training that had dominated education since the 
Renaissance and calls for a release from the traditional 
bondage to the classics. Instead of Greek and Latin 
for ‘culture’ and ‘discipline,’ and an order of society 
where the few are educated for a life of elegant leisure, he 
recommends the sciences and a new scheme of life where 
every one shall enjoy all advantages in the order of their 
_ telative value. “The attitude of the universities toward 
natural science,” he protests elsewhere,’ “‘has been that 
of contemptuous non-recognition. Collegiate author- 
ities have long resisted, either actively or passively, the 
making of physiology, chemistry, geology, etc., subjects 
of examination.” But Spencer uses the term ‘science’ 
rather loosely, and seeks to denote the social, political, 
and moral sciences, as well as the physical and biological, 
as being ‘of most worth.’ Hence he cannot with pro- 
priety be stigmatized for his ‘utilitarianism,’ as he has 
been so frequently. His ‘preparation for complete liv- 
ing’ includes more than ‘how to live in the material 
sense only,’ and in this respect his underlying principle

vocates a sub- 
stitution of

tional clas- 
sics.

against the

seems comparable to that of Herbart in his ‘moral rev 
ation of the world.’ With Spencer, education sho’ 
contain such material as will elevate conduct and m 
life pleasanter, nobler, and more effective. 
Huxley’s Advocacy of the Sciences.—Another gr 
popularizer of the scientific elements in education, wh) 
also stressed the value of the sciences for ‘complet 
living’ and social progress was Thomas H. Husley (1825 
1895). Huxley started his career as a naval surgeo: 
but rapidly developed a reputation through his in: : 
gations in natural science during a voyage aroun 
world. He became a professor of natural history 
devoted much time to lecturing and writing on sci 
His use of English was vigorous and epigrammatic 
he showed great skill in bringing his conclusions intc 
such simple language that the most unscientific persons 
could understand them. In an address on A Liberal 
Education’ before a ‘workingmen’s college,’ he most 
forcefully depicts the value of the sciences and | 
modern subjects in training for concrete living | 
ridicules the ineffectiveness of the current classical educa- 
tion. He graphically argues: 
“Suppose it were perfectly certain that the life and fortune of 
every one of us would, one day or other, depend upon his winning 
or losing a game at chess. Don’t you think that we shoul i 
consider it a duty to learn at least the names and the moves ¢ 
pieces? Yet it is a plain and very elementary truth that the : 
the fortune, and the happiness of every one of us, and, more or 
less, of those who are connected with us, do depend upon our 
knowing something of the rules of a game infinitely more difficult 
and complicated than chess. The chess-board is the world, the 
pieces are the phenomena of the universe, the rules of the game are

THE MODERN SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT 335 
what we call the laws of Nature. What I mean by education is 
learning the rules of this mighty game. In other words, education 
is the instruction of the intellect in the laws of Nature, under which 
T include not merely things and their forces, but men and their 
ways; and the fashioning of the affections and of the will into an 
earnest and loving desire to move in harmony with those laws. 
Where is such an education as this to be had? Has any one tried 
to found such an education? Looking over the length and breadth 
of these islands, I am afraid that all these questions must receive 
a negative answer. The whole circle of the sciences, physical, 
moral, and social, are even more completely ignored in the higher 
than in the lower schools. Now let us pause to consider this 
wonderful state of affairs; for the time will come when English- 
men will quote it as the stock example of the most stolid stupidity 
of their ancestors in the nineteenth century. If there be a nation 
whose prosperity depends absolutely and wholly upon their 
mastery over the forces of Nature, upon their intelligent apprehen- 
sion of, and obedience to the laws of the creation and distribution of 
wealth, and of the stable equilibrium of the forces of society, it 
is precisely this nation. And yet this is what these wonderful 
people tell their sons: ‘At the cost of from one to two thousand 
pounds of our hard-earned money, we devote twelve of the most 
precious years of your life to school. There you shall not learn one 
single thing of all those you will most want to know directly you 
leave school and enter upon the practical business of life.’ What 
does the middle class school put in the place of all these things that

compendious title of the ‘classics’—that is to say, the languages, 
the literature, and the history of the ancient Greeks and Romans, 
and the geography of so much of the world as was known to these 
two great nations of antiquity. It means that after a dozen years 
spent at this kind of work, the sufferer shall be incompetent to 
interpret a passage in an author he has not already got up; that he 
shall loathe the sight of a Greek and Latin book; and that he shall 
never open, or think of, a classical writer again, until, wonderful to 
relate, he insists upon submitting his sons to the same process.

those days had not yet fallen into dist 
work of Combe and his friends was : 
their advocacy of what he unfortunately tes ore 
education, which to most Englishmen of the time seemed 
synonymous with irreligious training.t In his work on 
Education, however, he emphasized instruction in the 
sciences relating to moral, religious, social, and political 
life, as well as those bearing upon man’s physical and 
mental constitution, and presented argument *-- ~~

sectarian in character.

THE MODERN SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT 333 
edited a set of lectures urging the claims of the various 
sciences under the title of Culture Demanded by Modern 
Life (1867). He also founded the International Science 
Series (1871), and the Popular Science Monthly (1872). 
Dr. Youmans spread scientific thought throughout the 
country, and by means of his republications made 
Buckle, Darwin, Huxley, Spencer, Tyndall, Haeckel, 
and others well known in America. 
A service for the sciences, bearing more directly 
upon the educational world, was that performed by 
Charles W. Eliot (1835- +), President of Harvard. 
This he accomplished largely by an extension of the 
elective system and an emphasis upon modern subjects 
in the curriculum of school and college. Even in his 
Inaugural Address be holds: “In education the individual 
traits of different minds have not been sufficiently at- 
tended to.” And fifteen years later, in his description of 
‘a liberal education,’ after showing that “the number of 
school and college studies admissible with equal weight 
or rank needs to be much enlarged” and that “a con- 
siderable range of choice should be allowed,” he argues 
for the natural sciences as follows: 
“The arts built upon chemistry, physics, botany, zodlogy, and 
geology are chief factors in the civilization of our time, and are 
gtowing in material and moral influence at a marvelous rate. 
Since the beginning of this century, they have wrought wonderful 
changes in the physical relation of man to the earth which he 
inhabits, in national demarcations, in industrial organization, in 
governmental functions, and in the modes of domestic life; and 
they will certainly do as much for the twentieth century as they 
have done for ours. They are not simply mechanical or material 
forces; they are also moral forces of great intensity.” 
Elsewhere he maintains that the elementary school in Youmans 
popularized 
science and 
the works of 
the great 
scientists.

its curriculum “should begin early—in the very first 
grades—the study of nature; and all its teachers should, 
tavaht eve even therefore, be capable of teaching the elements of physical 
mentary 
school. 
‘Theadvocates

felt that a 
knowledge of 
nature was in-

for human 
welfare,’ - and 
that the con- 
tent rather 
than the °

ally opposed 
the discipli- 
nary concep- 
tion of edu- 
cation, ** geography, meteorology, botany, and zodlogy, the whole 
forming in the child’s mind one harmonious sketch of its 
complete environment.” 
The Disciplinary Argument for the Sciences.—In 
general, the writers and lecturers interested in the 
scientific movement held that a knowledge of nature 
was indispensable for human welfare and constituted the 
‘culture demanded by modern life.” They felt that the 
content of studies rather than the method was of im- 
portance in education. Many of them, like the Ger- 
man reformers also expressed their dissent from the 
disciplinary conception of education urged by the classi- 
cists. Huxley thus parodies the usual linguistic drill: 
“Tt is wonderful how close a parallel to classical training could 
be made out of that paleontology to which I refer. In the first 
place I could get up an osteological primer so arid, so pedantic in 
its terminology, so altogether distasteful to the youthful mind, as 
to beat the recent famous production of the head-master out of the 
field in all these excellences. Next, I could exercise my boys upon 
easy fossils, and bring out all their powers of memory and all their 
"ingenuity in the application of my osteogrammatical rules to the 
interpretation, or construing, of those fragments. To those who 
had reached the higher classes I might supply odd bones to be 
built up into animals, giving great honour and reward to him who 
succeeded in fabricating monsters most entirely in accordance with 
the rules. That would answer to verse-making and essay-writing 
in the dead languages.” 1 
Yet the tradition of formal discipline and the belief 
in faculties or general powers of the mind that might

a > gO, 
a, THE MODERN SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT 335 
be trained by certain favored studies and afterward ap- 
plied in any direction were too firmly rooted to be entirely 
upset. Even the greatest of the scientists seem to have 
been influenced by this notion and to have attempted 
occasionally a defense of their subjects on the basis 
of superiority in this direction. After Spencer has 4 
made his effective argument for the sciences on the 
ground that their ‘content’ is so much more valuable 
for the activities of life, he shifts his whole point of view, 
and attempts to anticipate the classicists by occupying 
their own ground. He admits that “besides its use for 
guidance in conduct, the acquisition of each order of 
facts has also its use as mental exercise, and its effects 
as a preparative for complete living have to be considered 
under both these heads.” But he holds that by “the 
beautiful economy of Nature those classes of facts which 
are most useful for regulating conduct are best for 
strengthening the mental faculties, and the education 
of most value for guidance must at the same time be 
the education of most value for discipline.” As evidence 
of this, he undertakes to show that science, like language, 
trains the memory, and, in addition, exercises the under- 
standing; that it is superior to language in cultivating 
judgment; that, by fostering independence, persever- 
ance, and sincerity, it furnishes a moral discipline; and 
even that science, “inasmuch as it generates a profound 
Tespect for, and an implicit faith in, those uniform laws 
which underlie all things” ‘is the best discipline for 
religious culture. Hence, from the point of view of formal 
discipline and mental gymnastics, as well as of content 
and guidance, Spencer declares science, rather than 
language and literature, to be of most worth in educa- but the tra- 
ditional view 
of faculties 
and of formal- 
ism was 50 
fixedthateven 
subjects on 
this basis,
-P-A-G-E-354
336 A HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
tion. Thus Spencer shows that he is not altogether 
emancipated from tradition, and that he has not fully 
grasped the disciplinary claims of language, which he 
bases entirely upon memory training. He likewise 
begs the question in stating that nature is bound, as a 
matter of economy, to make the training that is best 
for guidance also the best for discipline. As a matter of 
fact, nothing is more uneconomical than nature, which 
always produces a superabundance, since much will 
necessarily be wasted. 
Moreover, numerous other advocates of the sciences, 
early and late, have similarly undertaken to steal the 
disciplinary thunder of the classicists. Combe main- 
tains that “it is not so much the mere knowledge of the 
details of Chemistry, of Natural Philosophy, or of any 
other science that I value, as the strengthening of the in- 
tellect, and the enlargement of the understanding, which 
follow from these studies.” So Youmans declares that 
“by far the most priceless of all things is mental power; 
while one of the highest offices of education must be 
strictly to economize and wisely to expend it. Science 
made the basis of culture will accomplish this result.” 
In fact, nearly every apologist for the natural sciences 
at some time or other has advocated these subjects 
from the standpoint of formal discipline. The argu- 
ments of the scientists, however, are often sufficiently 
rational to harmonize with modern psychology. Huxley, 
Youmans, Eliot, Karl Pearson,! Dryer,? and others 
allude ‘to various mental ‘habits, such as observation, 
inductive thinking, accuracy, breadth of view, inde-

THE MODERN SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT 337 — 
pendence, impartiality, and freedom from superstition, 
that are fostered by a study of the sciences, although 
these writers do not appreciate the fact that a ‘habit’ 
is by its nature not general, but specific, and that the 
ideals created by a study of sciences have to be definitely 
abstracted before they can be transferred. 
Asimilar argument for some sort of mental discipline 
has been urged in the case of each one of the physical and 
biological sciences. Galloway claims that chemistry is su- 
perior to biology, since it cultivates active, rather than 
passive observation, and to physics, because “‘it exercises 
habits of mind diverse to those induced by mathematics.” 
Tyndall, however, holds that “the study of Physics 
exercises and sharpens observation: it brings the most 
exhaustive logic into play: it compares, abstracts, and 
generalizes, and provides the mental imagery admirably 
suited to these procedures.” ‘‘The disciplinary value of 
zodlogy,” writes Bigelow, “is found in that it may con- 
tribute to the development of a scientific attitude of 
mind, by directing various mental processes, such as 
those involved in scientific observing, classifying facts, 
reasoning on the basis of demonstrated facts, exercising 
judgment and discrimination, and learning to appreciate 
demonstrated knowledge.” So botany, according to 
Henfrey, develops reasoning by analogy, which gives it 
“a high value as mental discipline, for the cases in which 
inductions have to be made in common life are most 
frequently of this kind.” Likewise, the peculiar dis- 
cipline of physiology is held by Paget to rest in its being 
“occupied with things of admitted incompleteness and 
uncertainty ” and in being “essentially a science of de- 
signs and final causes.”

the German inventions and the cogent arguments and vigorous 
during the campaigns of advanced thinkers during the nineteenth eighteenth ee . : *, century, it Century, training in the sciences was gradually creeping 
Has not until into educational practice. While the sciences began to

method of the nineteenth that the movement was seriously felt in teaching be- : : 
came com- education. Even in Germany the first attempts at 
mon there. studying nature were made outside the universities in the 
‘academies of science.’ But during the first quarter of 
the eighteenth century Halle, which had been realistic 
almost from its beginning, had become a center for science 
instruction, and by the close of the century Géttingen and: 
most of the other Protestant universities had started pro- 
fessorships in the sciences. It was not, however, until the 
beginning of the second quarter of the nineteenth century 
that, in Liebig’s laboratory at the University of Giessen, 
students first began to be taught through experiments, 
and it was after the middle of the century before this in- 
vestigation work had generally replaced the formal sci- 
ence instruction in German universities. Since then the 
development of science in the higher education of Ger- 
many has been phenomenal.

started his famous Realschule in 1747, and before the be- 
ginning of the nineteenth century similar institutions had 
spread throughout Prussia. Early in the nineteenth cen- 
tury, as a result of the influence of the philanthropinists! 
and the urgency of the new humanists,” the course of 
study in the gymnasiums of Prussia was considerably 
modified, and, as part of the compromise, some science 
was introduced.* The movement later spread into the 
secondary education of states in South Germany, and, 
while the total amount of science was not large, it 
managed to hold its place in the gymnasial curriculum 
even during the reaction to absolutism between 1815 and 
1848. In 1855 recognition was made of two types of 
real-schools, one retaining Latin in every year of the 
nine, and the other having its course determined in each 
case by the local authorities, and in 1882 these became 
part of the educational system as the Realgymnasium in 
the one case, and the Realschule of six years or the Ober- 
realschule of nine in the other.4 These institutions at 
present devote approximately twice as much time to the 
physical and biological sciences as do the gymnasia. 
Technical and trade schools, with scientific and mathe- 
matical subjects as a foundation for the vocational work, 
have also appeared as a species of secondary education in 
Germany.® The first of these were opened in Niiremberg, 
in 1823, but their rapid increase in numbers, variety, and 
importance has taken place since the middle of the cen- 
tury, and their development in organization and method 
has occurred within the past twenty-five years.

  34° A HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
The scientific movement was also felt in the elemen- 
tary schools of Germany during the early part of the 
nineteenth century. Science was considerably popu- 
larizéd by the schools of the philanthropinists,' and was 
widely introduced into elementary education by the 
spread of Pestalozzianism in Prussia and the other Ger- 
man states.? Before the close of the first quarter of the 
century the study of elementary science,—natural his- 
tory, physiology, and physics, appeared in various 
grades; geography and drawing were taught throughout 
the course; and geometry was included in the upper 
classes of the Volksschulen. 
France.—Before the Revolution in France the higher 
and secondary institutions found little place for instruc- 
tion in science. There was a chair of experimental 
physics in the College of Navarre of the University of 
Paris and at the Universities of Toulouse and Montpellier, 
and natural history was also taught at the more inde- 
pendent College of France, but, as a whole, education was 
dominated largely by humanisth. However, with the 
establishment of the Republic a new régime began in 
education, as in other matters, and science entered more 
largely into higher and secondary instruction. Talley- 
rand’s scheme of education presented the old ideas in a 
slightly modified form, but the next year Condorcet’s 
completely subordinated letters to science.* The cur- 
riculum that he proposed for his Imstituis, or secondary 
schools, consisted mainly of science, pure and applied, 
and his defense of the sciences is not unlike that of 
Spencer, except that it leans more on the argument of 
1See pp. 28f. 2See pp. 145ff..

THE MODERN SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT 341 
discipline. In 1794 the Republic also founded a normal 
school, where the famous Laplace and Lagrange gave 
instruction in science. Science occupied one-third of 
the course in the ‘central schools,’ 1 and in 1802 Napoleon 
had included in the scientific course for the lycée natural 
history, physics, astronomy, chemistry, and mineralogy. 
A further advance in quantity and method in secondary 
instruction was made in 1814, when it was provided 
by statute that the pupil in the classical course “will 
one year study animals and vegetables; one year minerals 
and chemistry; one year experimental physics.” On 
the ground that they were injuring classical studies, 
Cousin in 1840 had the sciences curtailed, but he was 
shortly forced to restore them upon an optional. basis. 
A contest between the two types of studies was carried 
on until 1852, when a bifurcation in the course put the 
two theoretically upon the same basis.?. The scientific 
course, however, has never been able to equal the prestige 
of the classical, although it has constantly increased in 
time and difficulty, and now zodlogy, botany, geology, 
physics, and chemistry extend through all the grades 
and are taught by laboratory methods. 
Some instruction in science has come to be given dur- 
ing the past forty years even in the elementary schools 
of France. In the lower primary schools the work is in- 
formal, and consists mostly of object lessons and first 
scientific notions. These are developed in connection 
with drawing, manual training, agriculture, and geogra- 
phy of the neighborhood and of France in general. In- 
struction becomes more formal in the higher primary 
schools, and includes regular courses in the natural and

physical sciences and hygiene, as well as geography, 
drawing, and manual training. In the normal schools for 
primary teachers the instruction in all the physical 
and biological sciences is even more thorough, and it 
is given especially from the practical point of view. It 
includes not only the facts and theories of general 
scientific importance, but it also emphasizes their appli- 
cations to every day life. For example, the flora and 
fauna of the neighborhood are studied in their special 
relation to agriculture. 
England.—In England, through the professorship 
of Newton at Cambridge, some study of physical science 
was stimulated at the universities before the close of 
the seventeenth century, and during the eighteenth sev- 
eral chairs in the natural sciences were established at 
Cambridge. But it was almost the middle of the nine- 
teenth century before the biological sciences and the 
laboratory method of instruction were introduced, and 
not until toward the close of the century did science 
become prominent at Cambridge and Oxford. And 
the most marked promotion of the scientific movement 
in England has occurred within the past fifty years 
through the foundation of efficient municipal universi- 
ties in such centers as Birmingham, Manchester, London, 
and Liverpool.! For many years the laboratory instruc- 
tion was given only in institutions outside the universi- 
ties. Higher courses in science by the new methods 
were afforded through the foundation of the Royal

of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering in 1864, 
and the organization of the Normal School of Science # in 
1868. All of these were in 1890 combined in a single 
institution known as the Royal College of Science. In 
1907 the City and Guilds (Engineering) College,” founded 
in 1881, was also merged, and the entire corporation be- 
came known as the Imperial College of Science and Tech- 
nology. The associated colleges are mainly supported by 
grants from the government, the London County Coun- 
cil, and the City and Guilds Institute. They are located 
at South Kensington, London, and have been furnished a 
number of excellent buildings in late years. An agency 
that was instrumental in encouraging this advanced study 
of the sciences, although formed primarily for the benefit 
of the elementary and secondary schools, was the Science 
and Art Department, which was in 1899 taken over as 
part of the national Board of Education.? It had its 
start through the Board of Trade in an attempt to en- 
courage a knowledge of art and design, but the work was 
soon extended to the schools and in 1857 the direction 
of science and art was brought under the charge of the 
Committee of Council. The following year a regular 
Science and Art Department was organized to bring 
under a single management the science, trade, and 
navigation schools already existing, and to facilitate 
higher instruction in science. A few years later this 
i These normal training classes were segregated from the work of the 
School of Mines (1861) and given the name above (1881) before all 
parts of the.work were again consolidated (1890). 
It was originally called the City and Guilds Technical College, and 
was included in the University of London, when that institution was 
reorganized (1899).

organization began to offer examinations and to grant 
certificates to teach science in the elementary schools. 
In English secondary instruction science first appeared 
, through the establishment of ‘academies’ by non- 
conformists toward the close of the seventeenth century. 
The courses of these institutions were rich in realistic 
subjects, and early in the eighteenth century included 
considerable work in mathematics, natural philosophy, 
natural history, anatomy, and other sciences. Although, 
after the Act of Toleration (1689), the academies wete 
permitted to be regularly incorporated, they had greatly 
declined before the close of the eighteenth century. 
At the same time the humanistic ‘public’ schools and 
secondary institutions of a private character as yet paid 
almost no attention to the sciences. In the first half 
of the nineteenth century an anti-classical campaign 
began to be waged by George Combe and his friends. 
They undertook to point out the relative weakness of 
linguistic studies as an intellectual training, and advo- 
cated ‘real’ training as opposed to that of words. The 
controversy with the classicists continued with ever 
increasing force from 1820 to the middle of the century, 
and the science advocates eventually began to found 
schools to embody the new ideals. Toward the close 
of 1848 the first ‘secular’ school was opened at Edin- 
burgh, and included in its curriculum a study of geog- 
raphy, drawing, mathematics, natural history, chemistry, 
natural philosophy, physiology, phrenology, and ma- 
terials used in the arts and manufactures, as well as 
literary, esthetic, moral, and religious subjects. Simi- 
lar institutions were organized at Edinburgh, Glasgow, 
Leith, London, Manchester, Birmingham, Newcastle,

Belfast, and many other cities of the United King- 
dom. 
While these schools did not Jast long, they were very 
successful for a time, and, together with the writings of 
Combe, did much to stimulate the reform in secondary 
education and the introduction of the sciences that 
shortly followed. The University Commission for 
Winchester in 1856 held that “‘good elementary instruc- 
tion in physical science is essential in the case of many 
boys and desirable in all cases.” Responding to this i 
judgment, Winchester College, the oldest of the great 
public schools, at once started a brief series of lectures, 
which was by 1865 expanded into a regular course run 
ning through the year. After 1868, as a result of the 
governtnental investigation of the endowed schools, si 
which showed an almost complete absence of science in 
the curricula, all the leading secondary schools began to 
establish a ‘modern side.’ This course generally included 
physics and natural history, as well as modern languages 
and history, but it was most reluctantly admitted by the 
institutions, and, while it has attained to great efficiency, 
it has never, except in a few schools, been accorded the 
same standing as the classical.course. The Department 
of Science and Art also afforded much encouragement to 
secondary instruction in the sciences by subsidizing 
schools and classes in physics, chemistry, zodlogy, 
botany, geology, mineralogy, and subjects involving 
the applications of science. Before its absorption into 
the Board of Education some ten thousand classes and 
seventy-five independent schools of secondary grade 
received assistance from this source.

fence bas tributed for technical instruction, and much aid was 
compulsory. furnished for the equipment of laboratories, lecture 
rooms, and workshops, and an increase in the staff of 
instructors. Since then laboratory instruction has rap- 
idly gained ground in the elementary schools. Neverthe- 
less, for a decade no subjects except the rudiments were re- 
quired in the elementary course, and such ‘supplementary’ 
subjects as elementary science and geography, if taught, 
were givenaspecialsubsidy. Since 1900 this scientific work 
has been made compulsory in the elementary curriculum. 
In the col. The United States—In the colleges of the United

here ms ing in the eighteenth century and a little even in the

ighteenth appear in the list of studies advertised at Harvard in 
1642, and ‘natural philosophy’ was offered in 1690 by 
the same institution. During the eighteenth century 
Yale, Princeton, King’s (afterward Columbia), Dart- 
mouth, Union, and Pennsylvania all came to offer work 
in this latter subject, or in ‘natural history,’ which might 
then be used to denote physics, chemistry, geology, and 
astronomy, as well as botany and zodlogy. As far as physics was concerned, before the Revolution it seems to have been a subordinate branch of mathematical

instruction, and owing to the limitations of scientific 
knowledge at the time, to have consisted simply of 
lectures on mechanics, hydrostatics, pneumatics, and - 
optics, with possibly brief discussions on heat and 
sound and a few experiments in electricity. There was 
even less biology taught. There were, moreover, no 
laboratories or instruments of precision, and chemistry 
was apparently not taught at all, except occasionally 
as an obscure and unimportant branch of physics. 
Since then, owing to the great increase in our knowl- 
edge of science, there have been the greatest change and 
enlargement of instruction. Whole fields of science have 
been discovered and defined, and others, like geology 
and astronomy, have been reclaimed from dogmatism, 
and science studies have slowly come into favor. In- 
struction in chemistry gradually grew up in the latter 
part of the eighteenth century through a study of materia 
medica at the medical schools of Pennsylvania (1768), 
Harvard (1782), and Dartmouth (1798). The move- 
ment was slower in reaching the colleges proper, but 
spread rapidly after it had once started. A separate 
chair of chemistry was established at Princeton in 1795, 
at Columbia in 1800, Yale in 1802, Bowdoin in 1805, 
South Carolina and Dickinson in 1811, Williams in 
1812, and so on, until practically all the colleges had 
recognized it as an important branch of study. But 
while experiments were from the first performed as 
demonstrations by the instructors, it was generally 
not until almost the middle of the century that students 
began to be admitted to the laboratories.1 About the

same time laboratories in physics began to be equipped 
with apparatus. Geology was included in the early 
professorship of chemistry at Yale, and was given a 
distinct chair upon the advent of James D. Dana about 
the middle of the century, while by 1825 Amos Eaton 
taught it as a separate subject through field study at 
Williams. In astronomy Harvard had a. telescope 
before the beginning of the century, Princeton devoted 
a room to instruments as early as 1803, Yale improvised 
an observatory by 1830, and a building was specially 
equipped by Williams in 1837 and by Western Reserve 
in 1839. Yet the instruments remained very ordinary 
and the methods authoritative and. prescriptive until 
the opening of the observatories at Cincinnati (1844), 
Cambridge (1846), and Michigan (1854), after which the 
development was most rapid. Biology was even longer 
studied through mere observation rather than investi- 
gation and experiment. Until Louis Agassiz opened his 
laboratory at Harvard to students just after the middle 
of the century, the courses were meager, mostly theo- 
retical and classificatory, and were given entirely by lec- 
ture, without field or laboratory work. Since Agassiz’s 
time, however, the subject of biology has been divided 
and subdivided into several sciences and administered 
by separate departments in the colleges and universities. 
The introduction of the sciences and the development 
of the elective system, which afforded an opportunity for 
taking them, were greatly promoted in existing Ameri- 
can institutions of higher learning after the publication 
the same as laboratory work, and within the next decade apparently a 
number of institutions adopted this ‘Rensselaer Plan of Education’ in 
chemistry, botany, geography, history, and geometry.

af Darwin’s Origin of Species (1859), and the dissemina- 
tion of that doctrine through Asa Gray, professor of 
natural history at Harvard, and William B. Rogers, 
president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
The intellectual development ensuing also brought about 
the foundation of such new institutions as Cornell and 
Johns Hopkins, which emphasized the teaching of 
science as an unconscious protest against the exclusively 
classical training. Special scientific and technological 
schools likewise began to arise. The Rensselaer Poly- 
technic Institute (1825) and the Lawrence Scientific 
School at Harvard (1847) had already been opened, but 
now similar schools of science, like Sheffield at Yale 
(1860) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
(1862), sprang up in all parts of the country. . In 1862 
the Morrill Act of Congress appropriated lands in every 
state to promote education in agriculture, mechanic 
arts, and the natural sciences. These grants, which 
amounted at first to thirteen million acres, were sub- 
sequently extended to new states as they were admitted, 
and the endowment was increased by the annual grants 
of money that were made under later acts. From these 
funds and private benefactions, further schools of science 
were started or old schools were strengthened in every 
state, and from 1865 on rapid progress was made in the 
facilities for pure and applied science in higher education. 
Through the academies, during the latter half of the 
eighteenth century and the early part of the nine- 
teenth, the sciences were introduced into American 
secondary education. Sometimes these were extended 
downward from. the colleges, but often they were subjects 
that had as yet been barely touched by the colleges, such new univer- 
sities, empha-

were founded, 
and special

as astronomy, natural philosophy, chemistry, botany, 
and geography. As a result, the colleges frequently 
found that their curricula were not meeting the popular 
needs as those of the academies were, and were forced to 
enlarge their program of studies. As the early high 
schools grew up, they continued the attention paid to the 
sciences by the academies. The first high school to ap- 
pear, that at Boston in 1821, scheduled geography in the 
first year; navigation and surveying in the second; and 
natural philosophy and astronomy in the third. A similar 
emphasis upon science appeared during the first half of 
the century in all the secondary institutions, whether 
known as academies, high schools, union schools, or city 
colleges. In all cases, however, instruction was given 
mainly through text-books, and, while experiments were 
frequently used for demonstration by the teacher, there 
was no laboratory work for the students. At first the sci- 
ences were included in the curriculum on account of their 
usefulness, but after the middle of the century, the de- 
mand was increased on the strength of their scientific 
value. These studies were by this time becoming more 
scientific through the discovery of new principles and 
-were being emancipated from the mere classificatory 
stage. But a tendency to overload the curriculum with 
‘ sciences, which had been evident in secondary education 
from the days of the academies, was much increased dur- 
ing the seventies by the demand of the legislatures in 
several states that candidates for teachers’ certificates 
pass an examination in several sciences. The high 
schools and academies endeavored to furnish the neces- 
sary training to prepare for these examinations, and until 
toward the end of the century the courses in the sciences

IN THE MODERN SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT 351 
were numerous and of rather superficial character. 
Within the last twenty years, however, the schools have 
come to limit each student to a relatively few courses 
taught by thorough laboratory methods. 
Except for geography, which appeared in the curric- ‘ 
ulum early in the century, the rudiments practically 
constituted the entire course of the elementary school 
until the time of Horace Mann. Largely through his ef- 
forts, physiology was widely introduced by the middle of 
the century. About a dozen years later the Pestalozzian 
object teaching began to come in through the Oswego 
methods, and tended to become systematized and form- 
alized. Use was made of materials in several of the sci- 
ences, and the pupils were required to describe them in 
scientific terms. Thus there was a transition from object 
teaching to elementary science, and later on, toward the 
close of the century, to the more informal presentation of 
the subject, known as ‘nature study.’ The nature study 
movement quickly spread through the country, and has 
most recently appeared in the guise of agricultural in- 
struction. Many states now require agriculture as a 
requisite for a teacher’s certificate, and many normal 
schools have come to furnish a training in the subject. 
The development of institutions to teach this subject will 
be discussed in the account of recent tendencies given 
in the next chapter.* 
Interrelation of the Scientific with the Psychological 
and Sociological Movements.—It is evident that there 
has been a marked scientific movement in the educational 
systems of all countries during the past two hundred 
years, The sciences began to appear in the curricula of

  The scientific

closely re-

discipline and 
in the effect

the other sub-

educational institutions in the seventeenth and eighteenth 
centuries, but their rapid increase, and the use of lab- 
oratories and the scientific method in instruction, dated 
from the middle of the nineteenth. In some respects 
this scientific movement has been closely related to the 
other modern tendencies in education,—the psycholog- 
ical and the sociological. The coincidence of the scien- 
tific movement with the psychological on the question of 
formal discipline has already been considered.1 The in- 
fluence of the development of the sciences upon educa- 
tional method also constitutes part of the psychological 
movement. The sciences demanded entirely different 
methods of teaching from the traditional procedure. 
These innovations were worked out slowly by experi- 
mentation, and when they proved to be more in keeping 
with psychology, they reacted upon the teaching of the 
older subjects so that educational method in general was 
placed upon a more scientific basis. Hence the method 
of the sciences, enforcing both inductive and deductive 
reasoning, is no longer the exclusive property of the sci- 
ences, but has been found to be the true method in history, 
politics, philology, and other studies. A corresponding 
improvement in the presentation of the form, content, 
and arrangement of various subjects has taken place in 
text-books, and a radically different set of books and au- 
thors has been rendered necessary. The scientific move- 
ment has thus discovered and popularized the method of 
teaching that all other branches are beginning to adopt, 
and has consequently come in direct contact and coéper- 
ation with the psychological movement. 
The scientific movement has even more points in com- 
1See pp. 3348.

I THE MODERN SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT 353 
mon with the sociological. In its opposition to the dis- 
ciplinarians and its stress upon the content of education 
rather than the method, the scientific tendency coincides 
with the sociological, although the former looks rather to 
the natural sciences as a means of individual welfare, and 
the latter to the social and political sciences to equip 
the individual for life in social institutions and to secure 
the progress of society. But while the scientist usually 
states his argument in individual terms, because of his 
connection in time and sympathy with the individualism 
of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the same 
writer usually, as in the case of Rousseau, Combe, Spen- 
cer, and Huxley, advocates the social, moral, and polit- 
ical sciences as a means of complete living. Similarly, 
the sociological movement has especial kinship with the 
economic and utilitarian aspects of the study of the sci- 
ences, for professional, technical, and commercial insti- 
tutions have been evolved because of sociological as well 
as scientific demands. Again, the use of the sciences in 
education as a means of preparing for life and the needs 
of society overlaps the modern sociological principle 
of furthering democracy, the best development of all 
classes, and the abandonment of artificial strata in so- 
ciety. As Hughes says in The Making of Citizens: 
“Until this tyranny of classicalism has been abolished, and the 
claims of science recognised, it will be impossible to realise the 
democratic ideal. Time again will, however, see the ideal realised. 
The first phase in this realisation will probably be the organisation 
of a system of schools avowedly independent of the classical spirit 
and keenly responsive to modern needs. Let us hope that they will 
not lack the true-humanistic spirit. The Berlin Conference of 
1890-1891 concluded that two types of secondary school were 
alone needed—the classical or Gymnasium and the modern or The scientific

Realschule. Intermediate types are unnecessary and pedagogically 
unsound. The adoption of modern sides in both England and 
France has been condemned in theory and found inefficient in 
practice. Such a double system, however, cannot be considered as 
a permanent realising of this ideal. Socially such a separation of 
the future citizens of the State is unfortunate, and therefore it is 
with interest and sympathy that all true democrats will watch the 
efforts of American educators to solve this problem.”

PRESENT DAY TENDENCIES IN EDUCATION 
Recent Attempts at a Reconstruction of Educational 
Practice——Because of the remarkable development of 
science and invention, the nineteenth century has often 
been referred to as the ‘wonderful’ century. Such a 
term affords no better description of material achieve- 
ment than of the remarkable progress that has taken 
place in education. The last chapter showed how the 
growth of the sciences during this period has been re- 
flected in the educational institutions of all countries; 
and previous chapters have indicated the extent to which, 
through various movements, education has been broad- 
ened and improved in conception and advancement. 
There has been a continuous gain in the centraliza- 
tion and democratization of schools, in the content of 
the course of study, in the methods of teaching and the 
professional training of teachers, and in the liberality 
with which education has been established and main- 
tained. But momentous as have been these changes 
and expansion of view, the near future of education will 
probably witness a much greater development in vision 
and concrete achievements. At the present time there 
are constant efforts at a modification and a reconstruc- 
tion of education in the interest of a better adjustment 
of the individual to his social environment and of greatly 
improved conditions in society itself. Educational

experimentation and discussion are being conducted 
along a great variety of lines, and are of a richer and 
more scientific nature than ever before. It is, of course, 
impossible to describe all of these movements even in 
the briefest manner, and it is difficult to select for con- 
sideration those most characteristic and promising. Yet 
some of the present day tendencies that appear most 
significant must at this point engage our passing atten- 
tion. 
The Growth of Industrial Training—The movement 
that is perhaps most emphasized to-day is the introduc- 
tion of vocational training into the curriculum of educa- 
tion. There is now an especial need for this type of 
training in industrial lines. Since the industrial revolu- 
tion and the development of the factory system, the mas- 
ter no longer works by the side of his apprentice and in- 
structs him, and the ambition of the youth can no longer 
be spurred by the hope that he may himself some day 
become a master. His. experience is no longer broad, 
but is generally confined to some single process, and only 
_a few of the operatives require anything more than low- 
grade skill, when productive efficiency becomes the main 
goal of the system. Nor, as a rule, will the employer 
undertake any systematic education of his workmen, 
since the present mobility of labor permits of no guarantee 
that he will reap the benefit of such efforts, and the mod- 
em industrial plant is poorly adapted to supplying the 
necessary theoretical training for experts. Hence an 
outside agency, the school, has been called upon to assist 
in the solution of these new industrial problems. 
Industrial Schools in Germany.—To meet the demand:

  schools, all 
the time was 
devoted to 
technical edu- 
cation, and 358 A HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
Europe have maintained training of this sort for at 
least half a century, and the United States has during 
the past decade been making rapid strides in the same 
direction. The especial plans of organization and in- 
struction that have been evolved in each case seem to de- 
pend upon the temperament of the people and upon the 
institutions and industrial conditions of the country or 
locality concerned. In Germany, where this training has 
had the longest history and is probably the most effect- 
ive, the work has been carried on through the Fort- 
bildungsschulen (‘continuation schools’).! Institutions 
of this sort were first established by Wiirtemberg in 
1695, to supplement the meager elementary education, 
and by the earliest years of the nineteenth century 2 
number of other German states had introduced them. 
The ‘industrial law’ of the North German Confederation 
in 1869 permitted the localities to make attendance at 
the continuation schools compulsory for all apprentices 
up to the age of eighteen, and required employers to 
allow them to attend. And after the Franco-Prussian 
war, when a desire to enter into industrial competition 
with the world arose, most of the other states and local- 
ities began to follow the example, and this legislation 
eventually became the basis for an imperial law (1891, 
1900). The course in the continuation schools at first 
consisted largely of review work, but the rapid spread 
of elementary schools soon enabled them to devote all 
the time to technical education. Through the estab- 
lishment of a large number of schools of various sorts, 
training is afforded not only for the rank and file of work- 
men in the different trades, but for the higher grades of

of vocations, and in housekeeping and motherhood. Brads | of

states, have added laboratories and workshops, and the ™™* #4 file. 
training has proved so valuable that many of the pupils 
return voluntarily after the period of compulsory at- 
tendance, 
During the last twenty-five years there have also been 
developed continuation schools for general educa- 
tion, rather than for special industrial training, known 
as Gewerbeschulen (‘trade schools’) or Handwerkschulen 
(‘artisan schools’). These institutions furnish theo- 
retical courses in chemistry, physics, mathematics, South Ger- 
book-keeping, drawing, geography, nature study, his- ae ns 
tory, and law. In South Germany there is a tendency peepee cal 
to combine theoretical and practical work, and to develop work, and 
schools adapted to the particular industries of the various North Ger- 
localities, but North German States generally confine erally con- 
the courses to theoretical training, and leave the practical courses to 
side to the care of the employers or associations. The theoretical 
system of industrial education in Munich, organized The Munich 
by Dr. Kerschensteiner, has been especially developed aed by 
and has attracted much attention. It includes an extra Kerschen- 
class in the elementary schools with the chief stress upon “3nen,pasa™ 
manual work, to bridge the gap between school life and Hema 
employment and serve as a preparation for the indus- to serve as a

Industrial Education in France——In Germany these 
industrial continuation schools are not intended to be a 
substitute for apprenticeship, but furnish parallel in- 
struction throughout this period. Switzerland and Aus- 
tria also use both these features in industrial training, but 
the one especially emphasizes the apprenticeship and the 
other the continuation school. Because of unsatisfactory 
conditions in apprenticeship, France even goes so far as to 
attempt to eliminate it altogether. More than any other 
country in Europe, it has made efforts to furnish the en- 
tire industrial training through continuation schools ar- 
ticulating with the elementary system. The pupils are 
admitted at thirteen, and obtain practice in the school 
workshops for three years. Iron-work is taught to all 
the boys, but the other courses vary with local needs. 
Girls learn to make dresses, corsets, millinery, artificial 
flowers, and other industrial products. A number of 
_ these continuation schools have added normal depart- 
ments, and there is a normal school for industrial train- 
ing at Paris. There are also throughout the country a 
number of national schools of arts and trades that are 
based upon the same principles as these lower industrial 
‘schools, and furnish a training for foremen, superintend- 
ents, and managers. There are also many evening 
classes for industrial training under voluntary auspices, 
ere 
but as a whole continuation education has not been | 
nearly as well developed in France as in Germany. 
Types of English Industrial Training—In England, de- 
spite the rapid industrial development, little attempt was 
made before the middle-of the nineteenth century to im-

These institutions had at first both day and evening ses- through in- 
sions, but after a generation became in many cases reg- dustrial edu- 
ular secondary day schools. There also arose many pri- 
vate organizations, held mainly in the evenings, to teach

but that real skill and technical knowledge were needed. 
With the immense body of unskilled foreigners and under 
international competition, American industrial develop- 
ment could be maintained only in the same way as in 
Europe by training an adequate supply of expert workers. 
At first this type of education was furnished through phi- 
lanthropy and private enterprise. Under such auspices 
there sprang up about the middle of the century a number 
of evening continuation schools in the larger cities. 
Among these were the Cooper Union and the Mechanics’ 
Institute in New York, the Franklin Union and the 
Spring Garden Institute in Philadelphia, the Ohio Me- 
chanics’ Institute in Cincinnati, the Virginia Mechanics’ 
Institute in Richmond, and the evening classes of the 
Young Men’s Christian Association of various places. 
Simple as this beginning was, the public schools were 
slow to follow the example, and it was not until very re- 
cently that evening classes in drawing, mathematics, 
science, and technical subjects were organized by the pub- 
lic school system. 
The first vocational institution to be conducted in the 
daytime was the New York Trade School, founded in 
, 1881 by Richard T. Auchmuty. He wished to have 
American mechanics trained for the building trades, and 
* believed that apprenticeship could no longer serve the 
purpose. Because of the economic difficulties in attend- 
ing, the pupils were at first given a course of only four 
months. Similar institutions arose slowly. At the end 
of twenty years there were but two more,—The William- 
son Free School of Mechanical Trades near Philadelphia 
and the Baron de Hirsch Trade School in New York, but 
since then the development has been more rapid. Since

1910 more than a dozen trade schools have been organ- 
ized through public and private support and in different 
parts of the country, and a number of other schools have 
been opened upon a commercial basis. By 1906 the first public or pri- 
vate support 
or upon a 
commercial 
basis, 
public trade school was established. In that year Colum- — 
bus, Georgia, opened as an integral part of the city sys- 
tem a Secondary Industrial School, in which specific 
trades were taught. A year later the Milwaukee School 
of Trades was adopted by the city. These were soon fol- 
lowed by the organization of public trade schools in Phil- 
adelphia, Portland (Oregon), Worcester, Indianapolis, 
and elsewhere. These schools are mostly for youths be- 
tween sixteen and twenty-five, but ‘preparatory trade 
’ schools’ for younger boys have also been started in New 
. York, Massachusetts, and other states. Such schools 
offer courses in drawing, elementary science, shop cal- 
culations, accounting, business forms, history, and Eng- 
lish, and afford a knowledge of shop materials and 
methods rather than training in a specific trade. 
Another recent variety of trade school is the ‘part- 
time’ institution, which gives students some theoretical 
and formal training while they are obtaining their prac- 
tical experience. These schools somewhat resemble the 
Fortbildungsschulen, but the individualistic spirit of 
American industry has as yet generally kept employers 
from releasing their apprentices for instruction during the 
working period of the day. This part-time alternation of 
practical and theoretical training is sometimes carried on 
within a commercial establishment. By such an arrange- 
ment the maximum of correlation between the two types 
of instruction can be accomplished, but the plan has been 
‘feasible only in the case of very large corporations. ‘Part-time’ 
schools, which 
afford  train- 
ing during ap- 
prenticeship, 
have recently 
grown . up,

instances are

the attempt to respond to a real need. Germany is 
generally admitted to lead in commercial as in industrial

Commercial Schools in England and France.—Thus 
Germany has reached a considerable degree of efficiency 
in commercial education, and has thereby greatly de- 
veloped her commerce. No other country has advanced 
so far in this direction. On the other hand, for a nation 
of commercial supremacy, England has, until lately, been England hes,

There are continuation schools under government super

wise, there have been established a number of commer- 
cial schools of secondary and even higher grade, like 
the School of Higher Commercial Studies at Paris. The 
government control has, however, retarded, rather than 
aided, the development of these institutions. 
American Commercial Education—In the United 
States we find that commercial education at first de- 
veloped through the typically American method of the 
recognition of public need by private enterprise. Early 
in the nineteenth century, and possibly before that, 
private schools and classes in book-keeping were estab- 
lished in all the chief cities. These ventures foreshad- 
owed the so-called ‘business colleges,’ which are under 
private management and now number about two thou- 
sand. They still contain more than one-half the total 
number of students receiving commercial education of 
any sort. Penmanship and book-keeping served as their 
foundation, and are still the main subjects taught. Often 
commercial arithmetic and commercial law were added, 
and later stenography and typewriting, but these schools 
have always been technical and narrow, and their in- 
structors are not infrequently mechanical, deficient in 
1See p. 310.

PRESENT DAY TENDENCIES IN EDUCATION = 367 
education, and swayed by purely pecuniary aims. While 
usually given the name of ‘college,’ or even ‘university,’ 
the institutions are in reality a species of trade school, 
and no longer lead in commercial education. In the late 
eighties many public high schools, normal schools, and 
universities began to offer commercial instruction, and 
there began a new era, leading to much development and 
improvement. 
Until about 1900, however, progress was slow. The 
high schools at first had the work forced upon them 
by the taxpayers, who objected when their children had 
to go to a private school to obtain a business training. 
The first courses, which lasted only two years, were 
undertaken as a necessary evil, and were fashioned in 
imitation of those in the private business colleges, but 
were often inferior to them. Within the last dozen years, 
however, some fifteen or twenty cities have opened sep- 
arate high schools of commerce, and have placed com- 
mercial education upon a stable basis. Here the course 
is like that of any regular high school, except that the 
studies are commercial, and it covers four or five years of 
serious study. University schools and colleges of com- 
merce have also sprung up about the same time. The 
state universities, because of their popular support, have 
been especially hospitable to this training, but many of 
the large privately endowed institutions have given con- 
siderable attention to it. In fact, a score of years before 
the real development began, the Wharton School of 
Finance and Commerce was started at the University of 
Pennsylvania (1881). Some of these colleges of com- 
merce base their technical work upon a liberal founda- 
tion, as in the case of Dartmouth and Harvard; others, Late in the

like Wharton and the schools in the state universities 
coérdinate their cultural and practical work; while a few, 
such as New York University, emphasize the practi 
element and reduce the liberal to a minimum. 
Recent Emphasis upon Agricultural Education- 
The latest phase of vocational education to be popular 
ized is the agricultural. The European countries have 
long realized the importance of this training, and during 
the past generation have everywhere organized agri- 
cultural instruction of both secondary and elementary’ 
grade. Courses in higher institutions had already been 
generally established. As early as 1875 France started 
the école pratique, a species of higher primary school with 
a course of two years, for training the sons of small 
farmers. These institutions now number about fifty and 
are most effective. Further, every normal school was 
in 1879 required to furnish agricultural instruction, and 
three years later similar legislation was made for the rural 
elementary schools. For some time the provision was 
general and indefinite, but in 1896 it was revised and 
made more. specific, and progress has since been very 
rapid. In Germany secondary work in agriculture is 
afforded in special institutions at the close of the Real- 
schule or after the completion of the sixth year of the 
Gymnasium or Realgymnasium.’ This course offers the 
natural.sciences and agriculture in place of languages 
and mathematics. Elementary instruction in agriculture 
has also been furnished in separate schools rather than 
through the existing elementary schools. England has 
done but little toward agricultural training in the schools, 
but several of the British colonies—Canada, Australia, 
1See pp. 289f.
-P-A-G-E-387
PRESENT DAY TENDENCIES IN EDUCATION 369 
the West Indies—have introduced it into certain 
grades. 
The United States has of late been especially emphasiz- 
ing this type of vocational education. The agricultural, 
or land grant, colleges, started in 1862,! increased the 
knowledge of this subject, stimulated an interest init, and t 
prepared the way for the extension of agriculture down- 
ward into the high school and the grades. This tendency 
was also promoted by the scientific and nature study 
movements.? Moreover, it was felt that the United 
States must become a great agricultural nation, and that 
existing methods of agriculture were exceedingly waste- 
ful. The first agricultural high school was opened at the 
University of Minnesota in 1888, and was successful 
from the start. Ten others were organized within a 
decade, and before long the subject began to be taught 
at the elementary schools. Since then the movement has 
been rapid in the secondary and elementary schools. 
The work is now also presented in county and district 
agricultural high schools, state and county normal 
schools, and a variety of private or semi-private institu- 
tions. There are now nearly one hundred agricultural 
high schools in the United States, and the subject is 
taught as part of the course in several thousand high and 
elementary school systems. As the movement has de- 
veloped, both educational and economic results have 
become far-reaching, and the conceptions of the purpose, 
needs, methods, and content of education in the Amer- 
ican schools have been greatly modified.

the material side of civilization. There is a rapidly 
growing sentiment in favor of specific instruction in mor- 
als. There are many reasons why this need should be 
especially felt to-day. One cause has sprung from the 
impersonal relations that have developed with the grow- 
ing complexity of business and political life. When 
men work for impersonal corporations, sell products 
to people they never see, or intrust their welfare to 
officials whose names are scarcely known, one strong 
factor making for honesty and virtue, that of personal 
relations, is lost, and the temptation to wrongdoing be- 
comes greater. Moreover, it is generally recognized that 
moral traditions are failing, as a result of the weakening 
of old religious sanctions, the new conditions in large 
cities, and other causes. 
Such social factors as these are responsible for the 
attention that has of late been directed to moral training 
in the schools. Since 1882 specific instruction in morality 
has been given in the schools of France. This training 
-has been purely secular in its nature, and has excluded 
religious elements and all appeal to the supernatural. 
The course has consisted entirely in direct teaching of 
ethical and civic duties. It has, in consequence, been 
violently opposed by the clergy, and, since the closing of 
the Catholic schools in 1904,! its efficacy has been 
seriously doubted, and the whole question is being re- 
opened and considered anew. In English education, on 
+he other hand, the teaching of morality has always 
yeen associated with religion. In the ‘board’ schools this 
‘eligious instruction has from the first been of a non- 
sectarian character, but in the ‘voluntary’ schools the

a

training has occupied more time and has stressed the 
creed and denominational teaching of some church, 
usually the Church of England.? After the Act of 1902, 
the contest over religious teaching was brought to a 
focus, and a self-constituted commission, with Michael 
E. Sadler as its chairman, undertook to investigate the 
whole subject of moral instruction. A large and illumina- 
ting report on the situation, including the opinions of 
leading thinkers from many countries, was published in 
1908-1909. In Germany and Switzerland the moral and 
religious instruction in all elementary schools is sectarian, 
and Catholic and Protestant schools are alike supported, 
wherever needed, at public expense. 
Moral Education in the United States——During the 
past decade there has been considerable discussion in 
the United States concerning moral education. The 
National Education Association at its annual meeting 
in 1907 passed the resolution: 
“Tt is the duty of the teachers to enter at once upon a systematic 
course of instruction, which shall embrace not only a broader 
patriotism, but a more extended course of moral instruction, 
especially in regard to the rights and duties of citizenship, the 
right of property, and the security and sacredness of human life. 
As a result, the committee made a report in 1908- 
1909 upon various phases of moral training, and recom- 
mended special instruction in ethics, not in the form of 
precepts, but through consideration of existing moral 
questions, to develop the conscience through reflection. 
A number of other methods are being investigated.

ing upon experiments with the high school pupils of the 
state; Professor Tufts of the University of Chicago has 
written and lectured upon the possibility of developing 
public morality by means of a study in the high schools of 
American industry, business, government, and society; 
the National Institution for Moral Instruction, through 
its secretary, Milton Fairchild, has been trying the value 
of moral lessons illustrated with the lantern; and Felix 
Adler has organized ‘courses of moral instruction in the 
Ethical Culture School of New York City, and has striven 
to introduce direct moral teaching into all schools of the 
United States. Another medium of great influence is 
the Religious Education Association, whose convention 
in 1911 was devoted to moral training, and whose 
Journal gives a broad summary of the progress of moral 
education in the United States. The report reveals a 
wide difference of opinion and practice, but an evi- 
dent tendency to trust other agencies than direct moral 
instruction. State laws, while often emphasizing the 
need, do not yet provide for moral instruction in such 
a way-as to have the schools assign a certain amount 
of time and cover a definite field. Sometimes in a county, 
city, or school under a single supervising officer a fairly 
unified system has been put into effect. As a rule, 
however, legislation has confined itself to instruction 
in citizenship, the effects of alcohol and narcotics, 
the humane treatment of animals, and other specific 
duties. 
The Development of Training for Mental Defectives- 
There is another educational movement most character- 
istic of the present day and more significant of the 
growth of the humane spirit than even the recent in-   
 
-P-A-G-E-391
PRESENT DAY TENDENCIES IN EDUCATION 373 
terest in higher moral ideals and conduct. It is found in 
the modern tendency toward adapting education to 
all, whatever their peculiarities, defects, or delinquen- 
cies. The most striking instance of this is the universal 
attention now given to the education of mental defec- 
tives. The history of the movement is comparatively 
modern. While institutions for the care of imbeciles 
were established in Germany, France, England, Scot- 
land, and the United States before the middle of the nine- 
teenth century, it was not until Edouard Seguin (1812- 
1880) came to America in 1850 that any serious efforts 
were made to educate them. Seguin began his syste- 
matic rational training of idiots at Paris in 1837, but, for 
political reasons, migrated to the United States and de- 
veloped his methods here. His general plan was to appeal 
to the brain through the sense organs by means of a train- 
ing of the hand, taste and smell, and eye and ear. He 
used pictures, photographs, cards, patterns, figures, wax, 
clay, scissors, compasses, and pencils as his chief instru- 
ments of education. His achievements were but little 
short of miraculous, and the stimulus he gave to the train- 
ing of defectives has been epoch-making, but the exagger- 
ated belief, which sprang up in consequence, that idiocy 
could be cured, has, of course, not been justified. Feeble- 
mindedness is largely inherited, and defectives cannot, 
even in the milder cases, compete successfully in the battle 
of life, except under most favorable conditions. While 
there is no point of demarcation at which they can be set 
off as a class from average or normal persons, and much 
less can they be discriminated sharply into such grades 
as ‘morons,’ feeble-minded, imbeciles, and idiots, they 
have certain well-known deficiencies in conceptual This prac-

thinking, concentration, and will, and beyond a certain 
point they seem incapable of development. 
In general, the ‘physiological’ training of Seguin has 
remained the most effective means. Since his day there 
has been a tendency to introduce intellectual elements 
into the training of the feeble-minded, especially in the 
case of high-grade defectives, whose education was not 
undertaken by him, but without much real success. 
Some institutions have even closely approximated the 
work of the public schools as far as the third or fourth 
grade, and have made the manual training quite a subor- 
dinate feature. But there is no strong evidence for be- 
lieving that intellectual studies have at all developed the 
minds of defectives. The apparent achievements in these 
lines are mostly the result of parrot repetition, without 
real assimilation, and do not compensate for the loss 
of a more useful education or of more kindly disposition 
in the pupils. The most approved training devotes more 
than half the time to woodwork, basketry, cooking, 
knitting, sewing, and other manual and domestic occu- 
pations, although the proportions are somewhat governed 
by the amount of mental deficiency in each case. 
Educational Institutions for Mental Defectives—All 
the great nations have now provided schools for the train- 
ing of defectives. Germany has over one hundred insti- 
tutions, with some twenty thousand pupils in them, al- 
though nine-tenths of them are not supported by the 
state, but are under church or private auspices. These 
schools generally stress manual education, but give some 
attention to intellectual lines, especially to speech train- 
ing. The most unfortunate feature is that the pupils are 
allowed to leave the institutions for their homes at sixteen,
-P-A-G-E-393

and in many cases marry and perpetuate mental defi- 
ciency. There are but few schools for defectives in 
France, outside the two near Paris. and the juvenile de- 
partment of the insane hospital at Bicétre, but these in- 
stitutions largely follow the physical work of Seguin. In 
London there is one excellent institution with two thou- 
sand pupils, where manual training constitutes almost 
the entire course. But there are five other schools so lo- 
cated as to serve the various parts of England, in which. 
the training is rather bookish and emphasis is especially 
laid upon number work. oe 
Thanks to the. start given by Seguin, America ‘has 
taken up the education of defectives more fully than any 
other country. Schools for the feeble-minded now exist 
in all except a few of the states, and there are some thirty- 
five or forty private institutions of considerable merit. 
Not far from twenty thousand defectives are being 
trained, although this is probably only about one-tenth 
of the total number of such cases in the country. Several 
of the commonwealths have laws providing that feeble- 
minded persons once in an institution must remain there 
for life, but in other states it is still possible for them to 
leave at sixteen, as in Germany. The type of education 
differs greatly according to the institution, ranging from 
almost purely manual training to a large proportion of the 
intellectual rudiments, but in all the work is adapted to 
the various grades in such a way as to raise them a little 
in the scale of efficiency and to keep them as far as pos- 
sible from being a burden to themselves and to society. 
Training of Moral Defectives.—Efforts are also being 
made by progressive nations to afford an education for 
moral defectives, whose lack appears chiefly in stability There are 
only a few

and will power. They closely approach the cases of men- 
tal deficiency and are often associated with them, and in 
a large measure they are best trained in a similar fashion. 
As far, however, as these abnormal persons are the prod- 
uct of unsanitary and immoral surroundings or poor 
nourishment, much is done by establishing more healthful 
conditions and furnishing exercises and plays that will 
develop heart, lung, and nerve power, and stimulate the 
brain to greater activity. Military drill and athletic con- 
tests are often used to develop alertness and prompt obe- 
dience to commands, and to supplant selfish spirit with a 
more wholesome merging in the group interests. 
Education of the Deaf and Blind.—Likewise, persons 
up to the standard mentally, but defective in some sense. 
organ, have for some time been given an education that 
will minimize the difficulty. There have been two chief 
methods for teaching the deaf. The manual or ‘silent’ 
method of communication was invented by the Abbé 
Charles Michel de 1’Epée (1712-1789) in Paris during the 
latter part of the eighteenth century, and his school was 
adopted by the nation in 1791. The other method, the 
‘oral,’ by which the pupil learned to communicate 
through reading the movements of the lips, was started 
in Germany early in the eighteenth century, but was not 
employed to any great extent until the time of Friedrich 
Moritz Hill (x805~1874). Most of the countries now use 
the oral method exclusively, or in connection with the 
older manual system. England abandoned the silent 
method shortly after the middle of the nineteenth cen- 
tury, although it is still used in Ireland, and both appear 
in the deaf schools of Scotland and Canada. France fol- 
lowed the sign system exclusively until 1879, when the
-P-A-G-E-395

German method was introduced. Instruction of the deaf 
by the manual method was begun in the United States at 
Hartford, Connecticut, in 1817 through Thomas Hopkins 
Gallaudet (1787-1851), who had studied in France. This 
system soon spread throughout the union, but, after his 
visit to Europe in 1843,' Horace Mann attempted to have 
the oral method adopted. While his efforts were not suc- 
cessful, the Clarke School at Northampton, Massachu- 
setts, was established upon that basis, and, after a long 
controversy, the new system has generally supplanted 
the manual or has been used in connection with it. Prac- 
tically every state in the union now has one or more 
schools for the deaf. Since 1864 higher education has 
also been furnished by the National Deaf Mute College 
(now Gallaudet College) at Washington, which is the only 
institution of its grade in the world. 
The first instruction of the blind through raised letters 
was given by Abbé Valentin Hatiy (1746-1822) at Paris. 
While his schools, owing to a lack of judgment, were fail- 
ures, the idea spread rapidly. Early in the nineteenth 
century there were one or more schools in each of the lead- 
ing countries of Europe, and a generation later insti- 
tutions of this sort were started in the United States 
through Samuel Gridley Howe (1801-1876) and others. 
Since then the number of schools has everywhere multi- 
plied rapidly. Industrial training has in most instances 
been added to the intellectual, in order to fit every in- 
dividual to be an independent workman in some line. 
Even pupils, both deaf and blind, like Laura Bridge- 
man and Helen Keller, have had their minds reached 
through the sense of touch.

Training for Extreme Individual Variations.—Simi- 
larly, by careful study and wise provision, every possible 
variation in individuality is now being furnished with the 
best training possible. Backward, retarded, and nervous 
pupils are being afforded special instruction even in the 
public schools. Open air class-rooms and better nourish- 
ment are being furnished for anemic and tuberculous 
children. Cripples and truants are alike given the train- 
ing best adapted to their peculiar needs. Even the excep- 
tionally brilliant pupil is now in a few school systems 
allowed the opportunity of improving his genius to the 
utmost. Negroes and Indians are also provided with the 
industrial and intellectual education that will in each case 
_ be most likely to lead to effective citizenship. Thus the 
wide differences in economic conditions, future career, 
and moral, mental, and physical constitution are being 
carefully considered, and the democratic ideal and the 
humane spirit are at the present time coming to be most 
fully realized in education. There is a definite move- 
ment toward furnishing opportunities to all according to

Recent Development of Educational Method.—Nor 
has the past century witnessed any cessation of the at- 
tempts at’ improved methods of teaching. Various 
suggestions and systems have been put forward and 
many have had an important effect upon school proce- 
dure. It is impossible, however, to discuss any except 
two or three of the more influential and prominent, and 
these can be considered but briefly. The occupational 
work of Professor Dewey and Colonel Parker’s scheme 
’ of concentration have especially had a pronounced effect
-P-A-G-E-397
PRESENT DAY TENDENCIES IN EDUCATION 379 
upon methods in the schools of to-day. They have 
greatly improved upon the motor expression and social 
participation of even the reconstructed Froebelianism, 
and have marked the growth of a body of educational 
theory and practice that places the methods of to-day 
far-in advance of anything previously known; The com- 
bination and modification of Ritter, Herbart, and Froebel 
worked out by Colonel Parker have perhaps received 
sufficient attention in previous chapters, but we may at 
» this point outline a little more fully the contribution 
: to method made by Professor Dewey. 
' The Experimental School of Dewey.—The methods 
' of John Dewey (1859- —_) were developed in an ex- 
perimental elementary school connected with the Univer- 
sity of Chicago from 1896 to 1903. The school did not 
' start with ready-made principles, but sought to solve 
| three fundamental educational problems. It undertook 
to find out how (z) to bring the school into closer rela- 
| tion with the home and neighborhood life; (2) to in- 
troduce subject-matter in history, science, and art 
, that has a positive value and real significance in the 
child’s own life; and (3) to carry on instruction in read- 
| ing, writing, and figuring with everyday experience and 
| Occupation as their background ‘‘in such a way that the 
child shall feel their necessity through their connection 
_ With subjects which appeal to him on their own account.” 
| The plan for meeting these needs was found largely 
in the study of industries, on the ground that “the 
school cannot be a preparation for social life except 
as it reproduces the typical conditions of social life.” 
The means used in furnishing this industrial activity 
were evolved mainly along the lines of shopwork, cook-        
    In the his- 
torical study 
of industries, 
Dewey found 
the solution of

ing, sewing, and weaving, although many subsidiary 
industries were also used. These occupations were, 
of course, intended for a liberalizing, rather than a 
technical purpose, and considerable time was given to 
an historical study of them. Dewey declares:4 
“The industrial history of man is not a materialistic or merely 
utilitarian affair. It is a matter of intelligence. Its record is the 
record of how man learned to think, to think to some effect, to 
transform the conditions of life so that life itself became a different 
thing. It is an ethical record as well; the account of the conditions 
which men have patiently wrought out to serve their ends.” 
It can be seen how fully this plan is in accord with 
the real principles of social coéperation : 
of individual activities underlying the wa 
and “‘so far as these statements correct:

“the school should be regarded as its ex:

such conditions of intelligent and sympathetic over- 
sight as to be a means of upbuilding and strengthening 
character.” . Hence, while the Chicago school is now at 
an end, the experiment in education developed there 
is still yielding abundant fruitage. It has stimulated 
similar undertakings elsewhere, and has greatly influ- 
enced both the theory and practice of the present day. 
The Method of Montessori.—The latest development 
in educational procedure and perhaps the most spectacu- 
lar is that originating with Montessori at Rome. Be- 
cause of its novelty and the extravagant claims made 
for it, it may well be given some detailed consideration. 
The new methods are not dissimilar to those of Froebel, 
but they more readily win our confidence from the fact 
that they appear to be based upon modern science, 
rather than metaphysics. Maria Montessori was the 
first woman to receive the doctorate in medicine at the 
University of Rome, and she has since had considerable 
training in psychiatry, psychology, and scientific peda- 
gogy. She was for a time director of the State Ortho- 
phrenic School, and her success in training the feeble- 
minded was most astonishing. She, therefore, naturally 
desired to try her methods with normal children, and in 
1907 accepted the position of educational director of the 
‘Houses. of Childhood’ connected with a set of model 
tenements. The scientific foundation of her. practice 
here is further shown in the conduct of her school. Care- 
ful records are kept concerning the heredity, parental 
occupation, feeding, and infantile sicknesses, and anthro- 
Pometric measurements are taken at regular intervals. 
Moreover, an expert inspection is periodically made of 
the sanitation and economic conditions in the home of The methods

each child. It is stated by biologists that many of the 
scientific statements in Dr. Montessori’s Method of 
Scientific Pedagogy! are inadequate and incorrect, but 
if the author is not as strong as she might be in her 
knowledge of the content of modern science, her system 
is at least scientific in spirit. 
That spirit seems further borne out by the Montessori 
attitude of allowing the pupil as complete freedom as 
possible and holding that the chief function of the 
teacher should be to study the activities of the child. 
“The transformation of the school,” says she, “must be 
contemporaneous with the preparation of the teacher. 
For if we make of the teacher an observer, familiar with 
the experimental methods, then we must make it possible 
for her to observe and experiment in the school. The 
fundamental attitude of scientific pedagogy must be, 
indeed, the liberty of the pupil.” Yn practice, Montessori 
carries out this fundamental belief more fully than most 
Froebelians, who also profess it.2 Instead of holding 
the children to a fixed and complete order of exercises 
imposed by the teacher, she maintains that all education 
worth having is ‘autoeducation.’ The children should 
select their own occupations and solve their own difficul- 
ties, and should be allowed to develop themselves both 
mentally and morally. Only when their activities inter- 
fere with the general interest or are useless or dangerous, 
must they be suppressed. While in this latitude toward 
individual expression Montessori carries out the ‘follow- 
ing, not prescriptive’ education of Froebel more logically

{ than that reformer himself, she does not develop partici- 
| pation in group activities to the same extent. Nor is 
the material used as rich and varied. There is little 
opportunity afforded for the Froebelian construction 
and invention, and the development of imagination is 
tuthlessly nipped in the bud. The interesting plays, 
songs, and stories of the kindergarten find no parallel 
in the ‘house of childhood.’ The conception of ‘auto- 
education’ is admirable, but it is difficult to see how 
genuine activities are to be carried out, except within 
a very narrow scope, with material so limited as the 
( ‘didactic apparatus.’ 
f The Montessori Curriculum and Apparatus.—The 
exercises peculiar to the Montessori schools fall into 
three main groups. ‘These are connected with (1) 
activities of practical life, (2) sense training, and (3) 
formal studies of the elementary curriculum. When the 
| child first enters the school, while he is beginning to 
{ find himself, he may take part in the activities of practi- 
( cal life. Besides practice in ordinary courtesy, setting 
the table, serving a meal, and washing the dishes, the 
children learn how to button, lace, hook, and clasp 
| various articles of dress by means of a unique apparatus. 
( To the opposite sides of light wooden frames are attached 
| strips of dress material, linen, and leather, which are to 
be fastened together at the center. Through constant 
practice with these materials the child learns to dress 
himself and trains a variety of useful muscular codrdi- 
nations. Such exercises might well be adopted by the 
progressive kindergarten or other modern school. 
The utility of the sense training is more doubtful. It 
seems to be clearly based upon the theory of formal disci- than Froebel; 
but she does 
not develop 
social partici- 
pation as 
fully, and 
does not use 
as rich and 
varied ma- 
terial.

pline and to be intended to train general powers and | 
discriminations. Dr. Montessori maintains that “the | 
aim is not that the child shall know colors, forms, and the — 
different qualities of objects, but that he refine his senses 
through an exercise of attention, of comparison, of judg- 
ment; the exercises are true intellectual exercises.” 
And this underlying theory is clearly revealed by the 
nature of the apparatus itself. The primal sense of touch 
is first exercised by passing the finger-tips of the child 
over various materials and pronouncing their nature as 
‘rough’ or ‘smooth’; and then by having him select 
them by this description. Similarly, other general senses 
are developed,— the ‘thermic,’ the ‘baric,’ the ‘stereog- 
nostic,’ the ‘visual,’ and the ‘chromatic.’ Exercises 
of this sort are of great value, as Montessori found, 
in training defective children,! but the assumption of 
their usefulness in the education of normal children 
seems to be largely based upon a false psychology. 
The feature of the Montessori system, however, that 
has attracted most attention is its apparent success 
with the formal studies, especially in the facility and 
enthusiasm with which the children learn to write and 
in the beauty of their writing. The inventor of the 
method, however, declares that this spectacular per- 
formance is of little account, save as a single link in the 
chain of sense development. All the tactile, dimensional, 
form, and visual training, she holds, leads naturally 
to the writing codrdinations. But Montessori has further 
invented three exercises by which the approach to the 
_ Pontaneous dexslopment_of the. graphic language’ 
is mfore directly accomplished. First, the “muscular 
1 Montessori frankly acknowledges her indebtedness to Seguin.
-P-A-G-E-403
  PRESENT DAY TENDENCIES IN EDUCATION 385 
mechanism to hold and use the instrument in writing” 
is developed by the child’s filling in the outlines of a 
geometrical form that he has traced upon paper. During 
this period the child is also engaged in “exercises tend- 
ing to establish the visual-muscular image of the alpha- 
betical signs” by means of sandpaper letters mounted 
on cardboard. The teacher shows the child how to follow 
the contour of a letter with his finger as if writing it and 
at the same time pronounce the sound (not the name) 
of the letter distinctly, and then further exercises his 
memory by saying ‘give me O’ and ‘give me J,’ and by 
asking ‘what is this?’ and ‘what is that?’ Lastly, he 
is exercised in the composition of words by selecting 
unmounted cardboard letters from compartments in 
a set of boxes resembling a compositor’s type-cases. 
“Now the child, it is true, has never written, but he has 
mastered all the acts necessary to writing.” This is 
the secret of the much discussed ‘explosion into writing.’ 
The art is learned so unconsciously that the children 
begin it almost spontaneously and are writing before 
they realize it. It seems to be the one great achieve- 
ment of Montessorianism, and if it can be applied to 
other languages not as phonetic as the Italian, it may be 
regarded as a permanent contribution to special method. 
The Montessori methods in the other formal subjects 
—reading and arithmetic—are not as striking. Reading 
is generally acquired after writing through the names of 
familiar objects written on the blackboard or upon 
cards. The word is shown the child, and if he interprets 
the sounds correctly, the teacher has him repeat them 
more and more rapidly until the word as an entity, and 
not as a succession of sounds, dawns on his intelligence. reading,

ij moetic. 
} social cobper- 
  386 A HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
After single words can be read with some facility, progress 
is made to short phrases and sentences. But there is 
nothing very novel about this method of securing in- 
terest in reading, and, when undertaken with English, 
where the sounds are so capriciously spelt, it can hardly 
be effective. Nor do the Montessori methods in arith- 
metic reveal anything very different in principle from 
the ‘table of units’ and other devices of Pestalozzi. 
The chief feature consists in acquiring the fundamental 
operations by means of rods of different lengths‘marked 
off into sections by coloring them red and blue. After 
the child has learned to count the sections, the teacher 
selects a rod at random and asks for the next longer 
or shorter, or has the child build up all the rods until 
each result equals the longest. Other exercises are 
similarly performed until the child has some command 
of elementary arithmetic. 
Summary of the Montessori System.—The value of 
the Montessori system to modern educational theory and 
methods of teaching is now fairly obvious. It is nomi- 
nally based upon scientific experiment, and, while its 
biological statements cannot always be accepted without 
modification, it is permeated with the scientific spirit 
that is at present animating modern education. Its 
emphasis upon individual liberty is most admirable, 
but the material for exercising this freedom is decidedly 
limited and social codperation is somewhat neglected. 
The exercises in practical activities form a valuable 
feature and the devices for acquiring writing are possibly 
acontribution. But it is to be hoped that a new method 
may yet arise for the lowest classes in our schools, 
which will combine the best characteristics of both the

Froebelian and the Montessorian pedagogy. The ex- 
istence of either as a mystery, cult, or propaganda must 
end, and both should be based upon and merged with 
the wider and more dynamic principles of modern edu- 
cational practice. 
The Statistical Method and Mental Measurements in 
Education.—One of the most significant of present day 
movements is the mathematical attitude taken toward 
the study of education, especially in the United States. 
In the spirit of the scientific age in which we live, educa- 
tors are coming to measure variations and changes in 
intellect, character, and conduct with the same general 
technique, clearness, and precision that are demanded 
by the physical and biological sciences. There is a 
growing tendency in all phases of education to sub- 
stitute objective, impersonal, and unbiased methods of 
investigation for the @ priori judgments of prejudiced and 
untrained persons or for the unchecked speculations of 
nebulous theorists. Analytic scrutiny, exact measuring, 
careful recording, and judging on the basis of observed 
facts are coming to replace guess work and metaphysics 
in education. Educational leaders are beginning to seek 
quantitative knowledge, to describe facts as numerically 
defined amounts, and to state relations or Jaws in terms 
of rigid, unambiguous equations. They are likewise 
ceasing to exalt the machinery of education and are be- 
ginning to examine its product, and, in consequence, they 
are finding that methods and processes long sanctioned 
by usage can yet be greatly improved. 
In the methods of educational administration espe- 
cially, great reforms are taking place along these lines. 
Individual cards for recording the school history of each quiring writ 
ing, however, 
are a contri- 
bution.

pupil are being arranged with ever increasing accuracy, 
and statistics are being taken after so definite and uniform 
a plan that the school facts within a given locality are not 
only made significant and valuable, but may be com- 
pared with those of any other section. The degree of 
efficiency in any system of schools and the relation of any 
one factor to a resulting condition may be ascertained 
mathematically and expressed in the terms of a ‘coeffi- 
cient of correlation.’ By recording not only those who 
graduate from a school system each year, but also the 
number that enter and that are promoted in each grade, 
the statistics of retardation and its causes and the propor- 
tion of those who finish the school can now be calculated 
with practically absolute certainty. In a similarly 
accurate way can be determined what is the best age at 
which to send a child to school, and whether children who 
have attended the kindergarten complete the grades in 
less time. A scientific study is likewise made of retarda- 
tion and elimination, backward pupils, physical defects, 
fatigue, supernormal children, and other perplexing 
conditions. Statistical methods are being used not only 
to throw light upon such isolated and local problems as 
have been mentioned, but ‘educational surveys’ are now 
being instituted in many cities and states, to discover the 
general educational conditions and the efficiency of the 
schools. Such investigations have been conducted with 
great success in Boston, New York, Baltimore, Boise, 
Montclair, and Orange, and in Wisconsin and Ohio. 
They are likewise planned for other localities, and are 
likely to extend to every commonwealth and municipality 
in the union. If power and means were given it, the 
United States Bureau of Education would probably
-P-A-G-E-407
———-—— a ee 1, — SS, PRESENT DAY TENDENCIES IN EDUCATION 389 
be glad to obtain a similarly scientific record of educa- 
tional facts for the nation. 
Probably the earliest and most prominent exponent of 
the new method of intellectual measurements is Professor 
Edward L. Thorndike of Columbia University. In his 
Educational Psychology he amply illustrates how a quan- 
titative description of individual differences and of thefac- 
tors that condition them is necessary to throw real light 
upon educational theory and practice, and how it may 
completely change school procedure of long standing. He 
holds that all qualitative differences may be reduced to 
quantitative, and that the scale for measuring should be 
not arbitrary and subjective, but objective and imper- 
sonal. Such scales for measuring variations in ability 
and changes that take place through instruction, it is dif- 
ficult to construct, because of the great complexity of the 
factors. At present they do not exist to any extent, but 
Thorndike has shown that they can be formed and has 
elsewhere specified what their requirements are. An 
ideal and valid scale of measurement of humanity, as of 
external nature, should have its points clearly marked, 
the distances between its points defined, and its zero 
point absolutely established. Scales that are up to these 
specifications have already been constructed for hand- 
witing by Thorndike, Ayres, Freeman, and Wilson; for 
arithmetical abilities by Stone, Courtis, Thorndike, 
Ayres, and Freeman; for English composition by Hillegas 
and Thorndike; for spelling by Wallin, Pearson, Whipple, 
and Suzzallo; and for drawing by Meumann and by Leuba 
and Hydeé.!_ These fields are, of course, more simple than

the teaching of science, history, and literature. There 
the aims are so intangible that at present it seems impos- 
sible to make standards of measure, but this, too, though 
difficult, must soon be accomplished. 
Thus advanced educators are coming to make sure that 
administrative procedure, the studies in the curriculum, 
and the methods by which they are taught are based upon 
valid reasons and are not the product of usage and tradi- 
tion. Scientific methods and accurate scales of measure- 
ment seem to have come to stay and to be destined to 
make rapid progress in the immediate future. Their ad- 
vantages are evident, but all results coming from these 
sources, while welcomed, must be frankly challenged and 
criticized, lest superficial use of these methods or too 
great an expectation of their achievements throw them 
into serious disrepute before they are generally estab- 
lished. 
Education and the Theory of Evolution-—But the most 
characteristic and far-reaching influence in education 
to-day is that contributed by the Darwinian theory of 
evolution. This fruitful hypothesis came to be generally 
accepted during the last quarter of the nineteenth century 
as the guiding principle of education, and has constantly 
increased in the illumination it has shed upon the educa- 
tive process. It has given an entirely new meaning to ed- 
ucation, and because of this broadened and deepened con- 
ception, it has greatly modified the course of study and 
revolutionized the method of approaching educational 
problems. It has wrought very much the same changes 
in the treatment of intelligence that it did in the biolog- 
of which G. D. Strayer was chairman. See Supplementary Reading,

ical sciences. Consciousness is no longer regarded as a 
fixed set of entities, but as a developmental process. In- 
stead of classifying and cataloguing mental processes in 
fixed groups, efforts are made to study their growth from 
the standpoint both of the race and of the individual. It 
is held that only through a knowledge of its origin and de- 
velopment can any phase of mentality be properly under- 
stood, and that it must be carefully traced from its incip- 
ient to its most advanced stages. Studies of mental 
development in the race, begun by Darwin’s Descent of 
Man, which recognized ‘sexual’ and ‘social selection,’ 
as well as ‘natural selection,’ have been continued by 
Romanes and Lubbock, and more recently by Lloyd Mor- 
gan, G. Stanley Hall, and Thorndike. Equally extensive 
studies have also been latterly made in the form of writ- 
ings on genetic psychology, child study, mental develop- 
ment, and adolesence by Preyer, Perez, and Stern, and by 
Hall, Baldwin, Major, and Shinn. In this way not only 
observation, but experimentation has been introduced 
into the study of mental processes, and a large mass of en- 
lightening facts has been accumulated. Likewise, from 
investigations of this sort have arisen interpretations of 
certain human psychoses as ‘reverberations’ or actual 
‘reversions’ to an infra-human ancestry. And there have 
even been formulated such definite theories as ‘recapitu- 
lation,’ according to which the individual passes through 
the various stages through which the race has gone in 
teaching the stage represented by the individual, and as 
the ‘prolongation of infancy’ in the human race for the 
sake of introducing the child to his intellectual and 
spiritual inheritance.

     olen as in knowledge, however, is the change that has taken place 
tionary con- in the conception, imagery, and terminology of education. 
ce tice ac! y. Educational discussions are now filled with such terms 
self. as ‘variation,’ ‘selection,’ and ‘adaptation,’ and such 
conceptions dominate all educational thinking. Text- 
books upon educational psychology, principles of educa- 
tion, and methods of teaching constantly employ the 
language of evolution. “Education,” says Bolton, “is 
a process of development and of modification or adjust- 
ment to environment and to the ideals of perfection 
conceived by society and the individual.” ! Similar 
ideas have been expressed by Spencer, Fiske, Butler, 
Horne, O’Shea, Bagley, Henderson, Ruediger, Mac- 
Vannel, and a host of others, who have familiarized 
all progressive teachers with the vocabulary of evolu- 
tion. Thus education is generally viewed by present 
day leaders as an evolutionary process, modifying the individual and society, and constantly producing new 
adjustments. It is regarded as an unfolding of poten- 
tialities, and not as a process of addition and accumula- 
tion, and the function of the school is held to be the pro- 
viding of proper stimuli to produce such unfoldment. 
Probably, therefore, the writers upon education of half 
a century ago would find themselves listening to a foreign 
language, if they were to be present at a gathering of 
recent educational thinkers, for through the reception 
of Darwinian evolution education has been born again.

| too numerous to be mentioned. In the organization 
and administration of the public schools there is a de- 
cided tendency toward centralization in educational 
activities, corresponding to the centralization in indus- 
trial and political affairs. There are also such matters 
as the new procedure in school hygiene, arising from the 
modern attitude toward the prevention of disease; new 
health regulations, as a result of having so many chil- 
dren housed in the same buildings; medical inspection 
and open-air schools; new tendencies in school archi- 
tecture; more extensive training of teachers; a rapid 
recognition of education as a profession; and the organi- 
zation of various types of teachers’ associations. In 
connection with higher education there are such new ten- 
dencies as university extension, correspondence courses, 
the correlation of the first two years of college with the 
secondary school, an increasing number of fields of pro- 
; fessional work, university interest in the practical prob- 
| lems of the people, and change in entrance requirements 
due to the new conceptions of education. Similar ten- 
dencies to secure economy, guard health, and cause 
education to serve democratic ideals are continually 
| arising. Educational theory and practice are in a con- 
{ stant flux, and progress in education is unceasing. Every 
; year accepted practice is being worked over and recon- 
structed. New activities and functions of education 
are being sought and developed, and nothing is held so 
sacred in administration, method, or content as not to 
be open for reéxamination and forced to justify itself 
( anew. Education has entered upon a most distinctive 
{ epoch of experimentation, change, and improvement.

CHAPTER XII 
THE EDUCATIONAL OUTLOOK 
Progtess since the Eighteenth Century—The dis- 
cussion of present day tendencies that has just been 
made, while very brief, serves to show how far we have 
progressed in educational ideals and practices since the 
~ighteenth century. And even the mere survey of modern 
1ovements given in the preceding chapters of this 
ook is sufficient to show how radical and rapid has been 
ur progress since Rousseau undertook so ruthlessly 
9 shatter all educational traditions. His recommen- 
ation of isolated education, so palpable in its fallacies, 
pened the way for the numerous social tendencies in 
aodern education and for great improvement in the 
aim, organization, and content of education. (‘The devel- 
4 opment of philanthropic education, which grown 
¥ everywhere into universal and national systems of schools, 
q the combination of industrial with intellectual training 
j started by Pestalozzi and Fellenberg, the Herbartian 
‘use of history and literature for giving us insight into 
jour duties toward our fellows, Frogbel’s encourage- 
ment of the social instincts by means of stories, songs, 
play, and constructive work, and many of the modern 
‘ tendencies looking to social welfare in all directions 
‘4 find some of their roots in the erratic reformer of the 
4 eighteenth Yentury who cried aloud for a radical change 
of front in society. } Likewise, by his absolute rejection

tive attitude 
of the eight- 
eenth cen- 
tury prepared 
the way for « 
the social,

tendencies of | 
modern times,
-P-A-G-E-416
and, although 
many of the 
modern move- 
ments were 
beyond the 
vision of the 398 A HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
of books and the standardized knowledge of the past, 
and his substitution of nature study and observational 
work, Rousseau opened the way to an increased use of 
sciences in the modern curriculum and to a more definite 
crystallization of the scientific movement in education. 
In partial sequence, we have seen the development of 
geography, nature study, and elementary science through 
Basedow, Salzmann, Pestalozzi, Ritter, Guyot, and 
Parker, the encouragement of scientific and technical 
institutions and courses in modern education, and the 
development of the positions of Spencer, Huxley, You- 
mans, and Eliot. Through Rousseau, too, was indirectly 
started the study of the child’s development and the 
formulation of his characteristics at different periods, and 
thus was begun the development of the psychological 
movement in modern instruction and the remarkable 
improvements in method. Rousseau, and to a large 
extent Pestalozzi, made their advances purely through 
a sympathetic insight into the activities of the child, 
but with Herbart and Froebel the educational process 
began to find its justification in an underlying basis of 
psychology. Then, through the new impulse of evolu- 
tionary doctrine, extraordinary developments in genetic 
psychology, the biological sciences, and sociology yielded 
a body of educational doctrine and practice that has 
-made possible methods of the most accurate and scientific 
type. 
The Eighteenth Century as the Beginning of Modem 
Times-—Of course modern education has advanced 
infinitely beyond anything even implied i ousseau 
or any of the reformers of the past century. {The educa- 
tional movements now going on were far in advance of 
re
-P-A-G-E-417
ee a THE EDUCATIONAL OUTLOOK 399 
their ken. They may upon occasion have intuitively 
felt the need of improved conditions in society and more 
natural practices in education, but such movements as 
vocational and moral training, the education of defect- 
ives, and the use of scientific measurements in educa- 
tion were much beyond the range of their vision. At 
times they seem to catch a glimpse of the idea of ‘natural 
development,’ but they could have had no inkling of the 
real meaning of evolution and of education as adjust- 
ment, which has become fundamental in the view-point 
and practice of to-day.\ Yet it is scarcely a strained in- 
terpretation to hold that modern education began in 
the eighteenth century with the effort at eradicating 
the past and beginning progress anew upon a more nat- 
ural basis. As indicated in this and previous volumes, 
educational history may be viewed from the standpoint 
of the development of individualism, and it has been 
held that by permitting variations in the social world, 
just as it has long been recognized in biology, there are 
evolved and fixed new types that will answer to changed 
conditions, and growth and progress will ensue without 
the intervention of conflict and cataclysm. 
From this point of view, the eighteenth century and 
Rousseau mark the parting of the ways. To follow this 
interpretation back to the beginning, it may be stated 
that during the day of primitive man no distinction at all 
was made between society and the individual, and 
practically all advancement was impossible, for no one 
looked beyond the present. With the appearance of the 
transitional period in the Oriental countries, the indi- 
1See History of Education before the Middle Ages, pp. 295f., and His- 
lory of Education during the Transition, pp. 315ft. modern edu- 
cation may 
be interpreted 
as beginning 
with the in- 
dividualistic 
recommenda- 
tions of Rous- 
seau. 
 
-P-A-G-E-418
400 A HISTORY OF EDUCATION 
vidual had begun to emerge, but was kept in constant 
subjection to the social whole, for man was quite enslaved 
to the past. As the Jewish, Athenian, and Roman 
civilizations developed, the beginnings of individualism 
were for the first time revealed, and some regard was had 
for the future. Then, in the teachings of Christ, there 
came a larger recognition of the principle of individualism 
and the brotherhood of man. Owing to a necessity for 
spreading these enlarged ideals among a barbarous horde 
of peoples, individualism was repressed, and throughout 
the Middle Ages the keynote was adherence to authority 
and preparation for the life to come. The cultural prod- 
ucts of Greece and Rome largely disappeared, and all 
civilization was restricted, fixed, and formal. But the bu- 
man spirit could not be forever held in bondage, and, after 
almost a millennium of repression and uniformity, various 
factors that had accumulated within the Middle Ages 
produced an intellectual awakening that we know as 
the ‘Renaissance.’ Its vitality lasted during the fif- 
teenth century in Italy and to the close of the sixteenth 
in the Northern countries, but by the dawn of the seven- 
teenth century it had everywhere degenerated into a. 
dry and dead study of the classics. This constituted a 
formalism almost as dense as that it had superseded, 
except that linguistic and literary studies had replaced 
dialectic and theology. A little later than the spread of 
the Renaissance, though overlapping it somewhat, 
came the allied movement of the ‘Reformation.’ This 
grew in part out of the disposition of the Northern 
Renaissance to turn to social and moral account the 
revived intelligence and learning. Yet here also the 
revival lost its mission, and the tendency to rely upon
-P-A-G-E-419
a distrust of individualism. Again, in the seventeenth 
century, apparently as an outgrowth of the same forces, 
intellectual activity took the form of a search for ‘real 
things.’ The movement that culminated in ‘sense real- 
ism’ appeared, but this small and crude beginning of the 
modern scientific tendency was for some decades yet 
held within limits. Associated with this realistic tend- 
ency, on the religious and political sides also appeared 
a quickening in such forms as Puritanism and Pietism, 
which likewise degenerated eventually into fanaticism 
and hypocrisy. Thus was the way finally opened for 
the complete break with tradition and authority that 
occurred in the eighteenth century. 
The Harmonization of the Individual and Society —— 
This destructive tendency, while in France at least 
most disastrous and costly, was the inevitable result 
of the unwillingness to reshape society and education in 
accordance with changing ideals and conditions. Yet 
out of the attempts at destruction, as we have seen, has 
grown a nobler structure. For a time individualism 
triumphed and ground authority under its heel, but 
when this extremity had been passed, the problem be- 
came how to harmonize the individual with society, and 
to develop personality progressively in keeping with its 
environment. Thus the nineteenth and twentieth cen- 
turies have put forth conscious efforts to justify the eight- 
eenth and to bring out and develop the positions barely 
hinted at in its negations. It is not alone the individ- 
ual as such that has been of interest in the modern period, 
"but more and more the individual in relation to the social 
| whole to which he belongs, as only in this way can the THE EDUCATIONAL OUTLOOK 401

value of his activities be estimated. This is revealed 
in the works of those who followed Rousseau, and, 
especially in the attempts of leading educational philos- 
ophers of the present day to frame a definition of educa- 
tion that shall recognize the importance of affording 
latitude to the individual without losing sight of the 
welfare of the social environment in connection with 
which his efforts are to function. Thus Butler, though 
recognizing the individual factor, especially stressed 
the social by declaring education to be “the gradual ad- 
justment of the individual to the spiritual possessions of 
the race.” ? Then he further declares: “When we hear 
it sometimes said, ‘All education must start from the 
child,’ we must add, “Yes, and lead into human civiliza- 
tion;’ and when it is said on the other hand that ‘all 
education must start from a traditional past,’ we must 
add, ‘Yes, and be adapted to the child.’” And the 
balance between the two factors of the individual and 
society is even more explicitly preserved in Dewey’s 
statement “ that the psychological and social sides are 
organically related, and that education cannot be re- 
garded as a compromise between the two, or a super- 
imposition of one upon the other.”? In the same way 
Bagley has made ‘social efficiency’ { the main aim in 
educating the individual to-day, and both elements are 
carefully considered by all modern writers in discussing 
ucational values. 
Thus the central problem in education of the twentieth 
and succeeding centuries is to be a constant reconstruc-

ion of the curriculum and methods of teaching so as to 
armonize a due regard for the progressive variations of 
he individual with the welfare of the conservative 
astitutions of society, and a continual effort to hand on 
he intellectual possessions of the race, but also to stimu- 
ate all individuals to add,some modification or new 
lement to the product. YIn this way the succeeding 
enturies may prove an eVolution from the revolutionary 
ighteenth and may feveal unending possibilities for the 
‘evelopment of the individual and society through an 
:ducation that recognizes both.

A History of Education before the 
Middle Ages 
By FRANK PIERREPONT GRAVES, Px.D. 
¢ History of Education in the University of Pennsylvania 
    
    cation before the day of the monastic schools, It presents sufficient 
material to mark the most significant movements and discloses the 
underlying principles without entering into unnecessary detail. 
All interpretations are based upon historical data collected from 
the sources, and direct quotation is liberally used throughout. 
“Professor Graves has taken the method of procedure, at once most 
natural and most philosophical, of studying each stage with a view to 
progress.” —The Outlook, 
‘A book which gives evidence on every page of ripe scholarship, 
breadth of view, and keen discrimination between significant things and 
mere detail.’—The School Review. 
“Professor Graves does well to give the profession the fruit of his 
abundant knowledge in a scholarly text-book and reference work, com- 
plete without being tedious, condensed without being lifeless.” —Journat 
of Education.

History of Education during the Mid- 
dle Ages and the Transition to 
Modern Times 
By FRANK PIERREPONT GRAVES, Pu.D. 
Professor of the History of Education in the University of Pennsylvania 
Cloth, r2mo, $1.10 
This volume is a continuation of the “History of Education 
before the Middle Ages.” Without dwelling upon matters re- 
motely related to the educational problems of to-day, an accurate 
picture is afforded of educational history between the sixth and 
the eighteenth centuries. The sources are extensively quoted, 
and selected lists of supplementary reading are given at the end 
of each chapter. The book is suitable as a text or a work of ref- 
erence. 
“Tp the same spirit of careful research and open-minded discussion 
that marked the first part of his work.” —The Independent. 
“The present volume is not only as good as, but better than, the pre- 
vious one. The work is conspicuous among histories of education as 
one of the most comiplete and interesting.” 
—Journal of Educational Psychology. 
“He has made of dry historical facts a narrative full of interest, one 
that touches the life, politics, religion, and philosophy of the times.” 
— Pedagogical Seminary. 
’“Clear and concise, Professor Graves’s work merits praise as an ex- 
cellent piece of text-book writing. The need for such a book has been 
keenly felt by the teacher of educational history.” —School Review. 
*A very interesting text and covers the ground thoroughly.” 
—Western Journal of Education. 
. “Professor Graves takes up the history of educational processes and 
ideals during this period in a very clear and illuminating way. 
—Charles A. Ellwood in The American Journal of Sociology.

Great Educators of Three Centuries 
By FRANK PIERREPONT GRAVES, Px.D. 
Professor of the History of Education in the University of Pennsylvania 
Cloth, z2mo, $1.10 
This book furnishes a popular account of the life and work of 
the men who, during the past three centuries, have introduced 
various innovations and reforms into modern education. While 
the facts of biography are narrated somewhat at length, an effort 
has been made to eliminate everything that does not have some 
bearing upon the contributions of the educator under consideration. 
“As history is largely a matter of biography, and as institutions are 
usually the lengthened shadow of a man, so the historic trend of educa- 
tion can be indicated well enough for the casual reader by an intelligent 
summary of the work of a few great educators together with comments 
on the tendencies and interrelations of that work. Professor Graves has 
gotten up such a summary in his brief volume, in which he has judiciously 
selected and clearly stated his facts, His comments on these facts are 
illuminative and his comments would seem to be well founded.”-—Boston 
Evening Transcript. 
“The thoroughly painstaking method of Professor Graves is evident 
on every page of these splendidly written books. A scientific and 
scholarly attitude combined with common-sense makes these by all 
odds the most practical text-books yet published in this field.”—Presi- 
dent W. G. CLIppINcER, of Otterbein University. 
“The social settings, dialectic methods, and ultimate achievements of 
nearly a score of illustrious world reformers are here brilliantly out- 
lined.”"—The Philadelphia North American.

Peter Ramus and the Educational 
Reformation of the Sixteenth 
Century 
By FRANK PIERREPONT GRAVES 
Professor of the History of Education in the University of Pennsylvania 
Cloth, r2mo, xii + 226 pp. $1.25 
“Professor Graves’s monograph performs a real service in bringing 
to notice again the work of this neglected scholar.”—The American Jour- 
nal of Sociology. 
“Professor Graves’s ‘Peter Ramus’ is the first thorough treatment 
of the work and achievements of this great French philosopher of the 
sixteenth century ever given to English readers.” —Journal of Education. 
“Dr, Frank Pierrepont Graves has placed philosophy under an obliga- 
tion by his memoir of Peter Ramus.”—The Argonaut. 
“A valuable work.” —Normal Instructor. 
“With delightful clarity and precision, he surveys the forces struggling 
for supremacy in northern Europe during the sixteenth century. . . . 
Most illuminating is his sketch of the Humanist Schools and their broad- 
ening influence upon the curriculums of colleges and universities.” 
—Boston Transcript. 
“A useful book of a type which ought to be more common than it is.” 
—American Historical Review. 
* Another educational treat.”—-Chautauqua Press.

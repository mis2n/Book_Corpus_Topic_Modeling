PREFACE 
Most books on play have been concerned with the 
spontaneous activities of children in fortuitous en- 
vironment, or with the description of the more formal 
games that children play. The author has not 
described games nor has she discussed the informal 
play of children as it may be observed ordinarily in 
the home, schoolyard, and vacant lot, but has given 
a picture of children at play in a planned environment. 
If the main task of civilization is, as Wallas suggests, 
to produce a new environment whose stimulation of 
our existing dispositions shall tend toward a good 
life, then the chief office of education is to provide an 
environment whose stimulation of the predispositions 
of children shall tend toward a good life. This is just 
what the author has done. She planned an environ- 
ment adapted to stimulate the play tendencies of 
children toward right responses. The original nature 
of children is conceived by the author not as antagon- 
istic to but as favorable for the development of those 
qualities, physical, mental, and moral, which we desire 
for mankind generally. Human nature as exhibited 
in children has nothing that is not available for the 
good life, if only the sequence of conduct be started 
in the right direction-—it has no quality we can 
afford entirely to lose. But it is in the wisely planned 
environment alone that human nature and the good 
life are wholly consistent. 
Now education has all too commonly made this 
mistake — it has been concerned over-much with the 
adjustment of children to the existing environment.

  viii PREFACE 
Emphasis has been placed upon what we hope our 
children will become rather than upon what children 
at the time may be. This is contrary to the method 
of nature and to the actual line of progress of the 
race as revealed in history./Man has continually 
changed environment to suit \his own needs, his ow 
nature, and not his nature to suit his environment. 
The present trend in education toward a greater 
recognition of human nature as manifested in child- 
hood may be interpreted as an attempt to do prac- 
tically what the author did, namely, to create an 
environment that shall stimulate the predispositions 
of children toward a good life, in the belief that 
abundant life in the present is the best preparation 
for abundant life in later years. Success in education, 
not alone for individual efficiency but even more for 
the rapidly enlarging social conceptions of the times, 
depends upon our knowledge and appreciation of the 
predispositions of children and our skill in providing 
the environment adapted to stimulate to good acts. 
Our schools are in much need of this skill. The 
author has made a genuine contribution to education 
in clarifying the philosophy underlying the spon- 
taneous play of children in the various fields of human 
endeavor and achievement and in showing how 
environment may be adapted to tapping the deep 
reservoirs of child nature, of human nature, in edu- 
cational work.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
My chief acknowledgements are to the children in 
the playgrounds of Pittsburgh and to Mr. George E. 
Johnson, who shared his vision of education through 
play with all who were associated with him during 
his superintendency of the Pittsburgh playgrounds. 
It was while endeavoring to plan a rich, free play life 
for the children under ten years of age in these play- 
grounds that it occurred to me to jot down a memo- 
randum of their spontaneous activities. After using 
these records in connection with my courses in play 
and in childhood education at the University of 
Pittsburgh, I decided to publish these records in 
book form along with my own interpretations of the 
educational meaning and value of particular types of 
play and games. Many of the records presented were 
supplied by play leaders or by students in the play 
courses. As far as is possible, I have mentioned the 
names of contributors in connection with the records 
which they supplied. The records kept by Miss 
Mary T. Lutz were especially valuable. Miss Frances 
McGough contributed a large number of photo- 
graphs after I had left active work in the field: to her 
I am especially indebted. To my late husband, whose 
interest and sacrifices facilitated the completion of 
this manuscript under difficult conditions and who 
made valuable suggestions after reading the prelimi- 
nary draft of this book, I wish to pay the tribute due to 
loyal and discriminating coéperation.

  CHAPTER I 
INTRODUCTION 
Sources of Material. — The plays described in this 
book are recorded just as they occurred in everyday 
life on the playground and in the home. Most of 
them are experiences vital to the growth and develop- 
ment of children. To the seeing mind and the under- 
standing heart these plays are throbbing with human 
interest. They present in panoramic view a vast~ 
throng of children playing out the great experiences 
of life, “hunger and labor, seedtime and harvest, 
life and death.” The children pictured in these 
records are not products of the imagination, nor 
so-called ‘‘universal types.”” They are real creatures, 
flesh and blood; moving among us; breathing vitally 
of life at its best and worst; laughing and crying, 
teasing and caressing, loving and hating, bullying and 
protesting. 
The result of this general survey of the field of 
spontaneous play in childhood is not a system of play 
representing a bird’s-eye view of all human endeavors 
and achievements as they are related to the home, 
school, church, and state, but a string of play activities 
touching life at every point. The arrangement is 
psychological rather than logical. The logical classi- 
fication exists for the adult mind alone. To the child, 
3 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  4 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
life is an unrolling and unraveling of tangled bits of 
experience; a laugh, a look, a frown, a tree to climb, 
a well to dig, a lesson to learn, a reward to win — all 
these are part and parcel of the changing and varying 
events which come from the constant adjustment to 
other people and things. House, store, soldier, 
carpenter, blacksmith, fireman, reindeer, chickens, 
hospital, restaurant, wedding and funeral are all 
shifting scenes in the panorama of life. The child 
plays one as naturally as he does another. And as he 
plays he discovers the meaning of things. No experi- 
ence is too sordid, none too sacred to be represented 
in play. Eating and sleeping, living and dying are 
all experiences which the child plays out; testing and 
proving, sifting and rejecting, according to standards 
of his own. 
The Arrangement and Classification of the Mate- 
rial. — In reporting this exploration into the field of 
spontaneous play the author has carefully avoided 
any comprehensive classification, either from the 
theoretical or the practical side. The problem of 
interpreting children’s play is a complex and difficult 
one. While we can study only particular plays or 
games, the clearer we keep in mind the original nature 
of the child and the results he seeks in any particular 
type of play, the surer we may feel that we are keeping 
on the main highroad of children’s interests. For 
this reason it seems safer to arrange in one group 
plays which are dominantly dramatic in significance; 
in another group, plays which are concerned primarily 
with movement; and in still another group, plays in- 
volving experimentation and manipulation of natural 
 
-P-A-G-E-17

INTRODUCTION a 
forces and materials than to attempt an elaborate 
classification of plays and games. We thus deal with 
large typical experiences indicating general interests 
and avoid separate classifications of specialized inter- 
ests. 7 
The Aim of This Study.—The aim of this excursion 
into the field of spontaneous play and work is to be 
concrete and specific in the interpretation of both. 
Work and play when considered theoretically have 
been the subjects of much controversy among biolo- 
gists, anthropologists, educators, and artists, who 
have searched for a special cause for play as opposed 
to work. In the popular mind we find play rather 
in disrepute, because associated either with sugar- 
coated methods of pedagogy or with amusement. 
On the other hand we find work as popularly miscon- 
ceived; it is often confused with labor, which is 
economically valuable, and perhaps intrinsically dis- 
tasteful. In order to clear up some of the popular 
misconceptions regarding work and play, as well as 
to approach the study scientifically, the author 
proposes to study play and work as ways of acting, 
modes of living, differentiating one from the other 
through an examination of the conditions, social and 
organic, which change action from one form of expres- 
sion into another. There seems to be a real need to 
approach play in a more nearly exact and measurable 
way. This method involves, of necessity, a study of 
the origin of play and of work in the original tenden- 
cies of man, and takes into account the effects of the 
psychological condition of children, as well as their 
individual variations along the lines of hereditary 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
  
  6 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
instincts and capacities. It also involves a recogni- 
tion of the social factors in the situations studied. 
The Path of Study Leads Away from the Idea of 
Play as an Instinct. — Whenever we embark on a 
study of individual plays in concrete social situations 
we realize we must depart from the time-worn custom 
of considering play as a single instinct. When play 
was so regarded, each type of play studied was viewed 
as so much red tape of heredity to be unraveled and 
disposed of before the real preparation for life could be 
undertaken. The following method of analysis reveals 
beyond the shadow of a doubt that play and work 
are made up of the serious use of a large variety of 
instincts and capacities, and are not due to the exercise 
of single-track instincts like hunting and fighting 
An Illustration of the Author’s Method of Analyzing 
Plays. — As an illustration of the complexity of the 
problem of analyzing children’s play, the writer pre- 
sents a typical analysis. This single example of the 
method of procedure ought to show the difficulties we 
meet in studying play. Two seven-year-old boys are 
playing policeman. They quarrel between them- 
selves as to which shall be the traffic officer and finally 
agree to take turns. One child stands on the crossing 
of a quiet street, raises a warning hand to a swift 
moving vehicle, signals some school children not to 
cross the street, assists a small child to collect the 
potatoes he has dropped from a bag, resists with blows 
an attempt of the other policeman to take his turn 
before the time agreed upon, leaves his post to chase a 
stray cat, then forgets all about his duties to run after 
a boy on a velocipede, hoping that he may secure

  INTRODUCTION 7 
from him a much coveted ride. In this apparently 
simple dramatic play we see many tendencies and 
instincts manifested. There is the tendency to 
dramatize striking events; there is spontaneous kind- 
liness toward the weak and helpless; there is the 
fighting instinct connected with self-interest; the 
arousal of a specific hunting response; and an example 
of the precedence of the claim of the new and novel. 
Not all of the records presented show as complex an 
array of tendencies, but few are as simple to analyze 
as the old-time method of approach would indicate. 
Many of the records collected in Pittsburgh reveal 
great limitations of environment, physical and social. 
Some of the children were literally starved for real 
experiences out of which to construct plays and games 
worthy of civilized society. While the enlarging of 
the content of play is one of the great advantages of 
play leadership in organized play centers, yet this can 
not be accomplished in a day or a year. : 
The old-time method of injecting into spontaneous 
play an entirely new content through the use of imita- 
tion is a serious menace to spontaneous, sincere 
expression. However, in playground centers so organ- 
ized that children play in groups according to psy- 
chological age, as in the Pittsburgh playgrounds, it is 
easier to work toward that goal. 
Limitations of This Study. — It would have been 
interesting to the author to trace the development of 
the play activities presented in this book into the field 
of subject matter in the elementary school curriculum. 
However, so many objectives enter into the making of 
curricula that are not necessarily considered in a
-P-A-G-E-20
  8 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
psychological analysis of spontaneous and supervised 
play, that it is hardly practicable to combine the two 
problems in one book. 
How to Use This Book as a Textbook. — For 
kindergartners and primary teachers who wish to use 
this book as a text in normal schools and colleges, the 
author presents in the appendix at the end of the book 
a list of books for collateral reading and exercises 
related to the problems and principles stated in each 
chapter.

  CHAPTER II 
PLay AND Work: AN INTERPRETATION 
Play and Work have the Same Origin. + In 
attempting to discriminate between play and work we 
may be certain of one thing: when the child plays and 
when he works he relies upon the same original ten- 
dencies, the inherited instincts and capacities to 
initiate his efforts, to start things going) A few 
examples from such original starting points as food 
getting, teasing, fighting, ownership, collecting, moth- 
erly behavior, rivalry, imitation, desire for approval or 
display, gregariousness, and the like, will perhapsserve 
to make clear how close in origin are work and play. 
For example, let an adult take some children to a 
wood for a happy playtime. Watch the children run 
hither and thither collecting flowers, leaves, and nuts. 
Notice their happy rivalry as they vie for advantage in 
seeking their treasures; see their motherly behavior 
toward the little ones in the group; watch the playful 
fighting and the various appeals for adult approval. 
Let us suppose the little group of children becomes 
lost from its adult protectors, and that night sets in. 
With the pangs of hunger comes the struggle among 
members of the group for the remainder of the lunch. 
Serious fighting takes the place of the former playful 
combat and an unpleasant rivalry of ideas regarding 
the best thing to do succeeds the former pleasantries 
in conversation. \ 
In both situations the mainsprings of action are the \ 
same; in one situation, however, adult protection and 
9
-P-A-G-E-22
  
  10 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
a favorable environment permit a happy, casual, 
almost accidental use of the instincts of food getting, 
fighting, teasing, ownership, collecting, motherly 
behavior, and the like; in the second situation, fear, 
hunger, cold, and dark stimulate a serious, carefully 
planned use of the same instinctive tendencies. 
Play and Work are Distinguished by the Conditions 
Attending Them. — Play and work, then, having the 
same origin are distinguishable by the conditions 
which force changes in actions. In both situations 
the children fight, tease, and manifest rivalry, owner- 
ship, motherly behavior, and the like. In one case 
reflection upon an end, the necessity to find protec- 
tion, food, warmth, and light, checks spontaneous 
activity and leads to a rearrangement of experience 
to get desired results, in fact forces the children to 
desist from a happy circumstantialWcasual set of 
actions and follow a course which prudence, fear, and 
apprehension render necessary. The, distinction is 
between a set of actions free, spontaneous, and 
/ intrinsically satisfying on the one hand, and a set 
of actions forced, planned, and necessary on the other. 
“There was, it is true, thought upon means and ends 
in the happy playtime; but the interest in the means 
«and ends involved in the play was sufficient to keep 
the activity going by its own momentum. When 
dark, hunger, and cold appeared, reflection had, to 
proceed along lines dictated by results, not by interest 
in the means of accomplishing the results. 
Examples.— A simpler situation may serve to 
clarify the main distinctions between work and play. 
A little child is playing on the floor with his blocks.

-P-A-G-E-24
  I2 SPONTANEOUS. AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
He builds a boat and pushes it about on the floor say- 
ing, ‘‘Chu, Chu.’ Suddenly it occurs to him that 
his boat should have a whistle. He looks among his 
blocks for one of suitable shape, and places it toward 
the front of his boat. But at the first movement 
the whistle topples over. Now the little child angrily 
pushes the blocks apart, thinking he is tired of boats. 
But somehow an image of a successful boat persists in 
his mind. Again he builds up the boat, this time 
placing the whistle toward the rear. Again the boat 
topples over. The boy sits still awhile contemplating 
the wrecked boat. Something urges him on. He 
patiently rebuilds the blocks, fastening the whistle in 
the middle of the boat by using two blocks to support 
it at each side. And behold, the boat proceeds 
smoothly on its course. The boy has mastered a 
necessary adjustment between work and play. He 
has learned to plan how to reach a certain end, even 
where the means devised are not intrinsically pleasant 
and satisfying. 
It would be folly, however, to conclude that when- 
ever a break occurs in a smooth-running, spontaneous 
activity the activity as a whole is work. With little 
children this might be true if the break were not 
happily and quickly bridged over. The ideas of little 
children naturally flow immediately into action. 
In building with blocks, for example, they are satisfied 
to make an oblong block serve for a whistle, a man, 
a track, or a bed, so long as the train of thought moves 
on unchecked. Older children check up their own 
play, imposing longer breaks in order to make their 
results approximate more nearly the realities of things. 
 
-P-A-G-E-25
  PLAY AND WORK 13 
A boy of ten years, for example, experiments perhaps 
an hour in order to construct an adequate whistle for 
a toy boat. He has some regard for the physical 
properties of things —his boat must be of seasoned 
lumber; his whistle must be cylindrical; his smoke 
stacks must be proportioned to cabin and deck — in 
fact, all the parts of the boat must be assembled to 
approximate the proportions of real boats. In attain- 
ing this result he carefully considers means and ends. 
He may searcli for an hour to find a piece of seasoned 
lumber, make a journey to a factory to get a piece of 
wood suitable for a boat, or whittle patiently for an 
hour to shape the prow or stern of the boat in lifelike 
proportions. In other words, he may work or even 
perform drudgery to attain a play purpose. Inso far, 
however, as the activity of boat making as a whole 
is enjoyed for its own sake, and is adapted to the boy’s 
powers and stage of development, even though it is 
frequently interrupted by reflection on the means and 
ends involved, it is or ought to be considered a play 
activity. 
Other examples may make more clear the fact that 
the attitude used in performing an activity determines 
some of the distinguishing factors between work and 
play. 
The Manner or Attitude in which an Activity is 
Performed is one Means of Determining Whether it 
is Work or Play. — A boy left alone with his new 
canoe experiments joyfully in adapting his strength 
and skill to the problem of moving his boat in the 
water. If he is given certain directions which he must 
follow explicitly, his activity becomes work because 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
  14 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
he can no longer yield himself to the accidental and 
casual discovery of ways and means of moving the 
canoe; he must subordinate experimentation to rules 
which necessitate a fixed series of muscular move- 
ments. ‘ 
One more example will perhaps suffice to show that 
work and play differ not so much in the external results 
reached as in the manner of gaining the results. 
Some little children in a playroom were making a doll’s 
bed. They had at their disposal a complete set of 
bed clothes which they were adjusting over a sick doll. 
Their movements were free and spontaneous, prompt- 
ed by the interest in caring for the doll. Presently a 
teacher appeared. She expressed surprise that the 
bed was so poorly made, forthwith removed the sick 
doll from the bed, and instructed the children how to 
make a bed properly. The joy died out of the 
children’s faces; their hands did quick service, their 
minds grasped the principles of bedmaking, but the 
results partook of the nature of work. When the 
teacher passed on, taking with her a sense of duty well 
done, the children began again to play. ‘‘ You poor 
little thing!” said one child, hugging her doll close to 
her, ‘‘your back must ache from lying on a bed 
without a pad!’’ Straightway she whisked the bed 
clothes off again and put them on the bed exactly as 
the teacher had done, with this exception: her mind 
was not bent on a successive order of acts connected 
with bedmaking, but on the purpose of making her 
doll comfortable and happy. The results partook of 
the nature of play, because the child’s attitude was 
free and experimental, since the series of events
-P-A-G-E-27
  PLAY AND WORK ag 
connected with bedmaking was subordinated to the 
child’s happy solicitude and care for her doll. 
Likewise in adult life,{so long as any series of events 
connected with a felt need are moving on progressively 
and happily, bringing immediate satisfaction in the 
performance, we may say the activity as a whole is 
play/ But where the series of events is constantly 
interrupted, and has 
to be checked up by a 
set demand for a re- 
sult not immediately 
satisfying in itself, but 
leading to some end 
which will be satisfy- 
ing later on, we say the 
activity is preémi- 
nently we) We say 
that a philosopher 
plays with ideas, an 
artist with pigment 
and color, a child with 
blocks, sand, and clay, 
not because the experi- 
mentations of each are 
entirely playful but because in each case the activity 
as a whole moves joyfully forward along the line of 
preference, obstacles and checks being met cheerfully 
and constructively. 
When Necessity of Better Adaptation to Life 
Brings Breaks in a Smoothly Running Activity, 
Work is Involved to Bridge the Difficulty. — Life 
abounds in illustrations of this psychological difference     A Task ror AN Aputt Is Pray to 
A CHILD
-P-A-G-E-28
  16 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
between work and play. Take the aforementioned 
philosopher as another example. Let us suppose he 
has played his ideas into a certain system of thought. 
With his whole being he delights to ponder over 
subtleties in opinion. He builds up concepts of 
relativity in thought values and he loves the thought- 
product built up in his mind. A war looms on the 
horizon; new values emerge, bringing the necessity of 
new relationships among ideas. His sense of the 
fitness of things is shocked. His thought building 
halts and proceeds laboriously; his attention is no 
longer spontaneous and joyous, but labored and 
derived. Slowly he rearranges the contents of his 
mind in the light of pressure from without. He no 
longer plays with thought values; he works with 
them, even performs mental drudgery to bridge over 
the chasms of spiritual and economic necessity. 
A last example of the difference in work and play 
as attributable to differences in psychological attitude 
may be taken from childhood. A little child likes to 
throw. When out of doors he picks up pebbles and 
stones, papers, pieces of wood or metal and thows 
them about as whim and caprice suggest. His mother 
appears and demands that he throw all these loose 
materials into a refuse heap. At once the boy’s 
interest wanes, his movements lose their pristine 
vigor; his throwing becomes aimless. And why? 
Because there is no chance to.experiment, to perform 
a muscular act and get variations in result. But 
suppose a wise educator appears upon the scene. 
She demands exactly what the mother does, that these 
different materials be thrown upon the refuse heap,
-P-A-G-E-29
  . 
PLAY AND WORK 17 
but with this difference: she suggests that the child 
watch carefully to see which he can throw faster, 
wood, metal, paper, or stones. The boy’s attention 
becomes alert, his muscular movements vigorous, his 
activity assumes the likeness of play. Why? Be- 
cause he can create through throwing. He can be a 
cause, experiment, watch results, and gloat over 
achievements. And now the work is completed and 
the refuse is set on fire. / Again the boy and the 
educator enter into the realm of play, They watch 
the burning fragments of material; they poke about 
with a stick to discriminate between ashes made by 
paper and by wood; they marvel at the resistance 
stone makes to fire; they watch the melting metal. 
They are scientists playing with physical laws and 
forces. They might have become mere toilers, col- 
lecting a pile of refuse to be relegated to the dump 
heap. ; 
Variation in Capacities and Habits Makes the Same 
Act Play for One Person and Work for Another.— In 
considering play, we come face to face with the 
problem of individual preferences due to differences in 
inherited capacities. It is this difference in original 
nature which makes it play for one child with an 
artistic temperament to experiment continually with 
color, pigment, and form, and converts another child’s 
experimentation along this line into work. If you 
place a group of children in a playroom and allow 
them free access to a large number of materials, one 
child will sometimes seek the same material again and 
again. In observing children in a certain playroom, 
the writer noticed that one little child returned day
-P-A-G-E-30
  18 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
after day to experimentation with color and f_rm. 
She built tiles into rugs and carpets; she painted with 
an abundance of color; she strung colored beads in a 
variety of combinations of color and form; she used 
colored papers and cloth skillfully and artistically. 
Another child with a strong bent toward mathematics 
revealed the tendency in the pre-kindergarten period. 
He used blocks with due rega-d for mathematical 
proportions. It was play when he studied out the 
proportions of a house and subjected the blocks to 
tests and formule of his own choosing; just as the little 
girl was playing when she chose colors for a carpet 
design. If the situation were reversed we should see 
the little girl work at building a house from a mathe- 
matical formula and the boy work to attain certain 
color combinations. We see, then, that individual 
differences in inherited abilities, or lack of abilities, 
account for some of the distinctions in play and work in 
the case of individual children. 
Differences in Physiological Condition are Attended 
by Changes in the Attitude of Work and Play. — 
Physiological condition or variation in readiness to 
act in certain ways at certain times, has to be con- 
sidered in discriminating between work and play. 
The law of readiness accounts for many of the differ- 
ences between them. A little child plays busily and 
happily at his blocks; suddenly his brain becomes 
fatigued and thought ceases to flow readily into 
action. The blocks at once become distasteful to 
him. With an impetuous gesture he pushes them 
away and runs to the swing or climbing rope. Here 
he assumes new postures, stretches himself, uses a
-P-A-G-E-31
  
PLAY AND WORK 19 
different set of muscles. After a time his interest in 
building reasserts itself. To compel him to continue 
at the building when brain tracts are not rested and 
ready to serve is to induce fatigue and force him 
into work or drudgery. 
An adult with literary talents sometimes sits down 
to creative work attuned in body and mind to the 
happy art of pouring forth his thoughts into channels 
of literary production. Again, when he seats himself 
at his desk, his brain seems set along other lines. 
With great difficulty he forces his attention to the 
task at hand. He may be able to overcome the lack 
of facility by sheer will power; or the conditions of 
fatigue may overcome him, and he may deem it wiser 
to set aside the work until he can command the desire 
and control the execution more readily. 
Types of Play are Closely Related to Structural 
Changes in the Body.— Writers advocating the 
biological theory of play have made a valuable con- 
tribution in that they have pointed out the close 
correlation between somatic growth and the changing 
types of play. One of the exponents of this theory 
of play says: ‘{Is it not significant that whatever the 
type of play may be, it just keeps pace with the type 
of somatic growth? And does not the impulse to 
exercise these growing parts furnish all the explana- 
tion that is needed for the existence of the play 
activity?! On the whole the attempt to account for 
types of play through “biological necessity’’ has led 
to the sanest effort yet made among investigators of 
1L. E. Appleton: A Comparative Study of the Play Activities of 
Adult Savages and Civilized Children, p. 78.  
-P-A-G-E-32
    
20 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
play. The biological theory of play accounts for 
many of the common elements in the play of children 
the world over and shows the relation of such big types 
of play as running games, fighting plays, and con- 
structive activities to the order of development of the 
nervous system. ; 
This theory of play has its implications in a con- 
sideration of the relation of play to work. Work in 
childhood should have almost as close a correlation 
with somatic changes as does play. That the work of 
children does not always answer the purpose of growth 
is a sad commentary upon society. When adults 
impose upon children tasks which are meaningless, 
and which do not function in the child’s needs, or 
worse yet, tasks the performance of which violates 
the nature of the doer, fatigue results from the 
conflict between desire and necessity. Children tire 
in play, of course, but only after the vital energy has 
spent itself and brought a train of beneficial accompani- 
ments. ‘ ; 
When any given piece of work is as closely related 
to its corresponding period of growth as is spontaneous 
play; when, in fact, because of the close relation of the 
work problems to the individual’s inherited powers 
and capacities, the transition of play into work is 
accomplished almost unconsciously, then and then 
only have we made work a method of social life which 
brings not only efficiency but a full rich life in its train. 
The Aims of a Desirable Schedule of Play and 
Work. — Yet even where play and work are so closely 
related that both spring from the demands of growth, 
and play passes insensibly into work, we still have the
-P-A-G-E-33
  PLAY AND WORK 21 
problem before us to see that both play and work in 
childhood are of the kinds that function in the social 
life and occupations of a people. It is of a tremendous 
advantage to enable children through early play and 
work habits to participate in the really productive 
work of the community. The individual has to 
acquire social efficiency, and if he accomplishes part 
of this adjustment in the early activities of life he has 
become initiated into society at a tremendously low 
cost of effort, and has done so while engaging in 
activities which enlist his own instincts, emotions, 
and imagination. The foundation of social efficiency 
is laid in the early activities of society. It is the part 
of education to lay this foundation so firmly that 
even the stress and strain of an unbalanced industrial 
world may not entirely warp the original purpose of 
work, and leave the individual in doubt as to the 
value of life and effort. 
Present Economic Conditions Make the Adjust- 
ment of Work, Play, and Labor a Difficult One. — 
But society is not at present so organized that each 
individual can perform the bit of work related to his 
powers and capacities. The specialization of indus- 
try, so organized that industrial processes are broken 
up into bits, often makes it necessary that each 
worker perform an isolated piece of work in order to 
bring about certain combined results. And so the 
product of each individual’s effort does not act as a 
stimulus for something new and better, but is used as 
a medium of exchange by which he buys desired things. 
So we have the labor problem of the eight hour day 
and the problem of recreation; for toilers experience
-P-A-G-E-34
    22 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
an exhaustion of used powers, and seek recuperation 
through calling into play the vast sources of unused 
powers, a tremendously wasteful system, and one 
which demands a national campaign for an enlight- 
ened social conscience with accompanying social and 
economic reforms. 
The Place of Adult Occupations in Children’s 
Play. — Adult occupations naturally play a large 
role in a repertoire of spontaneous play. This 
apprenticeship in the world’s work begins at home. 
Under the tutelage of the mother and father, children 
learn to play at bedmaking, dishwashing, and car- 
pentering. When they go to school they continue to 
participate in the industrial and economic work of 
society, for the modern school has taken on the 
various processes of world work under the guise of 
industrial trainingy gardening, and household arts. 
The activities appeal to the deep-seated instincts and 
capacities involved in both play and work. Accord- 
ing to the movement and direction of the activities 
involved they become play or work. The proper use 
of these adult activities in an educational program 
is the big problem that confronts our modern schools. 
It involves the necessity of acquiring real skill, not 
by routine or dictation, but through reflection and 
experimentation. In other words, these adult occupa- 
tions must be performed in the play attitude, yet 
involve work. Children must not be content with an 
easy, smooth-running way of doing things. They 
must accustom themselves to methods of scientific 
inquiry which, if need be, lead them far afield from 
momentary pleasure. In this way they acquire a   
-P-A-G-E-35
  
PLAY AND WORK 23 
scientific method and amass facts of practical impor- 
tance. They become so identified with the piece of 
work in which they are engaged that their thoughts 
and imaginations play fruitfully with the problem. 
This whole-hearted, spontaneous interest in a piece of 
work is a means of rich living in types of experience 
which the race has found most valuable. It is a 
different thing from the blind participation in cultural 
subjects which came from the old-time bookish study. 
The pith and kernel of the play problem lies right 
here. It is to help children to control their actions: 
more and more by intelligent reflection on a series 
of means leading to a desired end. It is to make 
play pass insensibly into work in order that action 
may not be at the mercy of caprice but may be the 
result of intelligent foresight. 
Conclusion. — In conclusion,( then, we may say 
that play and work differ not in Origin nor result, but 
in the movement of the activity itself. When the 
activity as a whole is smooth-running and is not 
interrupted by breaks essential for progress, we have 
an activity that is essentially playful. On the other 
hand when the activity as a whole is frequently im- 
peded by checks representing problems to be bridged 
over we have an activity that is essentially work. 
Both play and work have the same origin in deep- 
seated instincts and capacities; each of them may or 
may not satisfy some organic need, according to the 
extent to which they utilize nerve tracks ripe for action 
or violate the nature of the doer. Each may or may 
not satisfy a felt social need according to whether the 
activity functions in the life of the individual or is 
   
-P-A-G-E-36
    24 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
associated with results, imposed from without, which 
have no place in growth. Most situations which are 
legitimately called play in childhood are in reality 
highly complex social situations resulting in a com- 
bination of work and play. The problem is to keep 
the play attitude dominant and to increase the work 
element progressively with the age and development 
(of the individual.

  CHAPTER III 
EDUCATION THROUGH DRAMATIC PLAYS 
What Do We Mean by Dramatic Play ?— Much has 
been said and written of the so-called ‘‘dramatic 
instinct.” Often dramatic play has been character- 
ized as the outpouring of this instinct. Yet now 
through the findings of experimental psychology we 
have come to regard dramatic play in larger per- 
spective. It is no'longer thought of as the expression 
of a single instinct, but rather as the outgrowth of 
several tendencies. It is a result of the tendency to- 
ward general physical activity and of the law of habit, 
in which constructive images which have once led to 
action tend to do so again. In childhood, both these 
tendencies are stronger than among adults. Children 
naturally think in terms of action. They have a 
larger number of concrete mental images than adults. 
It takes years to build up the meanings, feelings of 
relationship, and judgments which gradually take the 
place of the rich imagery of childhood. What more 
natural than to visualize characters and events con- 
cretely in dramatic play? What more artificial than 
to reflect abstractly upon the meanings and signifi- 
cance of these characters and events? 
With this brief psychological background let us 
proceed to examine the dramatic plays of children 
concretely and to discuss their educational significance. 
The Infant’s First Dramatizations. — The infant 
early imitates in his own way the events which impress 
27

themselves vividly upon him. ‘‘ Before R was fourteen 
months old I watched with interest the pleased ex- 
pression on his face as he sat by the fire warming his 
clothes. Somehow warming clothes by himself was 
a more pleasurable experience than seeing me warm 
clothes: the act was motor as well as sensory, tactual 
as well as visual. Oftentimes he would scuttle over 
the floor, a dust cloth in his hand, touching chairs in 
imitation of dusting, or he would seize a brush and 
scrub the carpet vigorously as he had seen the kitchen 
floor scrubbed. Holding a newspaper as an adult 
does when reading was another of his favorite plays.’”! 
Before a child is three years old a good part of his 
waking hours is given to imitative dramatic plays. 
Mr. George E. Freeland watched a baby two and a 
half years old an entire day and discovered fifty-four 
dramatizations.? 
Growth in the Mental Content of Early Dramatiza- 
tion. — ‘‘Why,” we ask, ‘‘does the child perform such 
acts? Is he merely copying what goes on around him 
by a mechanical reproduction of the striking features 
of adult acts, or is he getting inside the act mentally 
and thus discovering its meaning?’’ As adults we 
can only interpret the meaning of these childish acts 
by studying the results in the child. It is obvious 
that such activities mean something to the child 
because of his persistence in them and the accompany- 
ing signs of pleasure. It is also possible to observe 
changes in his actions due to his gaining new meanings

by reproducing the acts of others. That is, if he 
persists in warming clothes, scrubbing floors, and 
dusting, there is a change and usually improvement 
in his representation due to the laws of exercise and 
effect. While to the adult the child may seem to be 
merely copying, he has in fact attained his result by 
attention, experimentation, and observation of results. 
Many educators have believed that such acts as the 
aforementioned are acquired as a result of the instinct 
of imitation. In speaking of. imitation, Thorndike 
says: “I can find no evidence that any such tendency 
is original in man. As will be stated later, certain 
particular sorts of behavior do originally provoke in 
the spectator behavior that resembles them, but, so 
far as I can see, behavior in general does not.’’! 
And again, ‘‘The direct potency of behavior in creating 
something like it in another human being’s behavior is 
not discoverable in any series of experiments in which 
the effects of the laws of exercise and effect are pre- 
cluded or allowed for.’’! 
What the Child Dramatizes and Why. — What the 
child dramatizes is not due to circumstances alone. 
He has different interests, physical and mental, at 
different ages, and selects the part to play which 
exercises the instincts and capacities already in action. 
He sees scrubbing all his life, but he first reproduces 
it, not only because the pattern is constantly acted 
before him, but also because he has an innate ten- 
dency to make many minor bodily movements and 
scrubbing provides a satisfactory form of exercise. 
1E. L. Thorndike: ‘The Original Nature of Man,” Educational 
Psychology, Vol. I, pp. r10, 111.
-P-A-G-E-43
EDUCATION THROUGH DRAMATIC PLAYS 31 
He sees policemen and soldiers all his life, but he 
dramatizes their activities at a time in life when he 
admires physical prowess and when his physical 
growth makes it possible for him to simulate the 
external appearance of bravery. Back of dramatic 
plays can be seen some tissue hunger of the developing 
mind and body, some physical craving, some mental 
need reaching out for expression. This gives the 
child’s reason for selecting particular types of play. 
To some extent, however, the content of dramatic 
plays is conditioned from without, patterned, as it 
were, from the activities most frequently seen and 
known. We have only to observe children closely in 
their play to find out what their fathers do, how their 
mothers conduct their homes, and the topics of daily 
conversation among members of the family and 
neighbors. If we are keen observers, it is possible to 
tell what kind of discipline the home affords; tyran- 
nical behavior is as sure to be copied as habits of 
submission, while the coarse actions and rough 
language of parents or servants are as likely to become 
ingrained in the habits of children as the gentle 
manners and refined speech of cultured parents. Any 
striking behavior is likely to be copied in play; in fact 
this is how children grow to understand the meaning 
and significance of manners and morals. 
The Commonplace Activities of Life are a Source of 
Valuable Dramatic Plays.—Some _ kindergartners 
object to children’s realistic dramatization of such 
utilitarian occupations as washing, ironing, scrubbing, 
and street cleaning. They prefer to have play centered 
in symbolic material, and so have invented games
-P-A-G-E-44
  32 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
in which the child is supposed to be interested not so 
much in the overt activity as he plays carpenter, 
blacksmith, or knight, but in a symbolic meaning 
read into these plays by Froebel. In some mystic 
way children are supposed to imbibe a sense of the 
economic relationship the family bears to church and 
state. Many regard this symbolism beyond the ken 
of childish minds. There was at one time a difference 
of opinion among kindergarten teachers as to whether 
a child’s play should deal with things within his 
experience or types and symbols which may be outside 
the realm of his experience. Should he dramatize the 
policeman and the fireman as brave persons, or 
plumed knights on horseback as a type of chivalry 
and bravery? Again, experimental psychology has 
clearly established the fact that symbols may be safely 
used in childhood only after direct personal experience 
with the thing symbolized, and then only as an adjunct 
to experience. 
To a large number of kindergartners it has always 
seemed that the healthy imagination deals with real 
things as they appear to the eye. To the child, the 
common household activities are not mere bits of 
work necessary for the maintenance of the home; they 
represent interesting ways of manipulating physical 
objects and forces, and demand judgment and 
imagination in using them. Pumping water, sweeping 
the floor and washing dishes are activities tedious to 
most grown-ups because such work fails to satisfy 
any inner need. Nerve tracts not ready to act are 
used; attention is forced, and fatigue comes rapidly.

such exercise! The nerve tracts are ready to act; 
much energy is used with little fatigue; and the work 
thoroughly satisfies the nature of the worker. Such 
activities command the interest of children, who thus 
imitate the actions of grown-ups with pleasure and 
profit to themselves. To sum up, there seems to be 
no psychological foundation for this discrimination 
against so-called utilitarian play. It has been clearly 
t monstrated that the roots of play and work are one 
and the same, and that most of the original tendencies 
leading to play initiate work as well. 
A List of Spontaneous Dramatic Plays Gathered 
from Playgrounds. — The records of dramatic plays 
in some thirty playgrounds of Pittsburgh show no 
work too common, no experience too sordid to be 
dramatized. Playing house with dolls, having com- 
pany for dinner, dramatizing the roles of various 
wnembers of the family; keeping hotels, restaurants, 
banks, stores of all kinds; playing church and school; 
‘cowboy, Indian, Robinson Crusoe; dramatizing such 
historic events as the Boston Tea Party and the > 
events of the French and Indian Wars; playing; 
hospital and funeral; taking on the work of the fireman, 
cobbler, blacksmith, dressmaker, street-cleaner, livery- 
man, etc.; playing telephone, train, fishing, diving, 
circus, menagerie; imitating the life and movements of 
butterflies, grasshoppers, rabbits, goats, reindeer, 
birds, and chickens: all these, and more, the records 
show to be subjects for spontaneous dramatic play. 
Breadth of a Child’s Interests as Seen in Dramatic 
Play. — This breadth of children’s interests in dra- 
matic plays and games indicates more than a remark-
-P-A-G-E-47
  EDUCATION THROUGH DRAMATIC PLAYS 35 
able catholicity of taste. With lack of power to con- 
centrate for long periods and a short span of attention 
this would be a dull world for the child, could he not 
overcome such limitations by breadth in play interests. 
Parents often complain that the kindergarten inter- 
feres with concentration by supplying so many and 
varied types of activity. They aim to counteract 
this training by supplying their own children with 
only a few playthings and toys. In this way parents 
limit children’s development. It is impossible for 
children of kindergarten age to give continuous 
attention to any one thing. They need a breadth of 
play interests. Let children of kindergarten age flit 
from one play to another. The poverty of mental 
content accounts for the fact that no one object 
holds the center of attention for a long time. As soon 
as experience adds new meaning to objects, and the 
span of attention increases with age, the power to 
concentrate will increase naturally. We forget the 
characteristics of childhood when we endeavor to 
limit the field of play; we need to remind ourselves 
hat adults necessarily narrow their interests to those 
necessary for a livelihood and that childhood is the 
time to give a broad foundation through play. 
All through childhood there is a strong tendency to 
imitate the striking features of the environment. 
Anything unusual or picturesque appeals to children 
and often leads to dramatizing the person, event, or 
force which has made a-new or unusual_impression. 
Other things being equal, children select people and 
activities that are novel or that permit the display of 
force, movement, and striking acts. Up to the sixth

year firemen, policemen, Santa Claus, fairies, brown- 
ies; carpenters, blacksmiths, and the like are favorite

exercise, permit manipulation of objects, and create 
in the young imitators a feeling of importance. 
The Tendency to Imitate Striking Activities and 
Active or Picturesque Types of Personality. — After 
the seventh year there is a growing tendency to 
imitate strong and vigorous types. Cowboys, 
Indians, soldiers are played over and over again 
because these characters stimulate admiration at an 
—
-P-A-G-E-49
  
EDUCATION THROUGH DRAMATIC PLAYS 37 
age when the performance of physical feats seems 
grand and heroic to children. The minister, teacher, 
scholar, or clerk may be as worthy of admiration as 
the more physically strenuous types, but at an age 
where adventure and physical prowess appeal to the 
wholesome activities of children’s growing bodies such 
characters are seldom copied in play. After the 
tenth year there is seen a tendency to reach out 
beyond the environment for subjects and events to 
dramatize; especially is this true if familiarity with 
history and good literature has been gained. 
Illusion in Dramatic Play. — There is a tendency 
to describe imaginative dramatic play as ‘‘make- 
believe.” Konrad Lange has shown that with the 
higher animals especially there is the element of 
illusion or conscious self-deception. Groos says that 
the capacity for illusion is the most interesting 
feature of imitative dramatic play, and adds: ‘‘On the 
ther hand, the waking consciousness seems to be 
shaken through it all.’’!. How true this is, we see in 
watching children make-believe. Playing that grass 
is salad, a clothespin a doll, and sand sugar, does not 
indicate that the child is making-believe except from 
the adult viewpoint. He does not eat the grass or 
taste the sand. His imagination gives him the 
ability to substitute the qualities lacking in the 
immediate objects. Again, when a child plays bear, 
tiger, and reindeer, these animals are vividly present 
in imagination. His mind overcomes limitations of 
time and space; the bear stalks about, growls, and 
pursues food; still more, the child identifies himself 
1K. Groos: The Play of Man, p. 307.

with the bear by himself representing these bear-like 
characteristics. The adult who does not see the 
importance of this power of the mind to translate 
things not present to sense into realities loses sight of 
the most central thing in the intellectual life of the 
child. 
—— The Play Attitude in Early Childhood One of 
Freedom. — An attitude of mental freedom character- 
izes the dramatic play of children from four to eight 
years of age. A child does not demand that a thing 
really resemble in physical appearance what he pre- 
tends it represents; that is, there is no identity 
between the physical traits of an object and the 
mental images associated with it. A broomstick 
becomes a horse not because it suggests the form and 
outline of a horse, but because it lends itself to loco- 
motion easily and use is more essential in play than 
appearance. Likewise, as occasion demands, a board 
becomes a sled, a boat, a train, or a slide, and to all 
purposes becomes one as easily as another. The 
essential thing is not the board, but the ideas clustered 
about the use of it, the quality of the mental images 
which call it into life as the object it represents. The 
following quotation from Stevenson illustrates the 
freedom with which a child uses objects to clothe his 
ideas: ‘‘The chair he has just been besieging as a 
castle, or valiantly cutting to the ground as a dragon, 
is taken away for the accommodation of a morning 
visitor, and he is nothing abashed; he can skirmish by 
the hour with a stationary coal-scuttle; in the midst 
of the enchanted pleasance he can see, without a

EDUCATION THROUGH DRAMATIC PLAYS 39 
sensible shock, the gardener soberly digging potatoes 
for the day’s dinner.’’! 
In Later Childhood the Fanciful Element is Re- 
placed by Interest in Reality. — There comes a time, 
however, when the ideas which things suggest must 
resemble realities; so also must the objects employed in 
dramatic play represent in detail the ones they stand 
for in life. This attitude begins after the seventh 
year when, in school, training in facts is stressed and 
memory work is considered important. This training 
is accompanied by a corresponding interest in detail 
and skill in workmanship. The child is no longer 
satisfied to run and utter a war-whoop as an expres- 
sion of Indians; he must make for himself an Indian 
costume, construct a wigwam, and portray a series of 
activities true to Indian history. 
During this period the tendency among teachers of 
dramatics to limit costume to a slight addition to the 
ordinary dress seems to the author to be a violation 
of the laws of mental life. While a cap, a shawl, 
and an apron were sufficient for many parts in the 
years before nine, the older child’s imagination de- 
mands the vivid portrayal of a mood. Care should 
be taken, however, to keep a healthful balance 
between the desire for material detail in costume and 
the power of mental growth through a correspond- 
ingly rich imagery. 
Training of Imagination Through Dramatic Play. — 
When children engage in spontaneous dramatizations 
they not only reproduce the mental images that cluster 
1R. L. Stevenson: “Child’s Play,’’ in Virginibus Puerisque, pp. 
218, 219.
-P-A-G-E-52
  40 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
about the thing they are representing, but they 
rearrange and reconstruct these images in a certain 
perspective. Some details are rejected, others are 
stressed, as thoughts flow out into action. For 
example, in playing fireman or policeman a certain 
plot is formed as ideas become clarified and settle in a 
fairly permanent form. And because self becomes 
identified with the play, the emotions enter in, adding 
a richness and vividness to the thought. 
Training in Productive Imagination. — One of the 
present tendencies in education is to demand a great 
deal of reproductive work, in which those pupils who 
possess good memories shine. This tendency in 
education bears directly upon the problem of dramatic 
play. While dramatic play is dependent upon repro- 
ductive imagination for the stuff with which it works, 
the very nature of dramatic play makes for freedom 
in the movement of imagery. The value of dramatics 
as a field for training productive imagery is apparent 
at once. If we wish children to do really creative 
work in life, we must open up fields of practice in which 
those possessing creative power can exercise it. And 
as all children possess some degree of native ability in 
productive imagination, all should have dramatic 
games. Not everyone, it is true, can expect to invent 
new machinery, create new systems of philosophy, or 
develop a new social era; but all can use what native 
ability they have to construct for themselves the best 
kinds of environment their abilities permit. 
Dramatizing Fact and Fancy. — Facts, fairy tales, 
and myths afford a child from four to eight years old 
varied opportunities to use productive imagination.
-P-A-G-E-53
EDUCATION THROUGH DRAMATIC PLAYS 41 
Children of this age dramatize facts as well as fiction. 
They have no mental perspective by which they can 
discriminate between fact and fancy, other than by 
trying to make both work in life. Dramatic games 
provide an opportunity to try out both fact and fancy, 
and to make comparisons with similar events in life. 
By the tenth year, training in sense perception has 
straightened out much of the inevitable confusion 
between fact and fancy. For example, children learn 
that in fairyland, witches, goblins, dwarfs, and giants 
perform miracles, but in actual life man awaits the 
fulfillment of natural forces and laws. After the tenth 
year, children are less susceptible to the fairy element. 
They depend upon observation and memory, and look 
to history and fiction for sources of dramatic play. 
Stories for this age should include scenes from narra- 
tive history and the lives of great men who conquered 
natural forces and laws through invention and ex- 
ploration. The records presented for the purpose of 
study show the pitiable background in stories many 
children in the playground possessed. When good 
stories were presented as a basis for dramatization, 
children found them as satisfying to portray as the 
cheap stories seen in the movies or the happenings of 
their own lives. 
Training in Observation. —In representing their 
own conceptions of things, say in playing doctor, 
soldier, carpenter, or blacksmith, what enters into 
the children’s plot depends upon their observations of 
the characteristics and activities of each. ‘‘Let’s - 
play fire!’’ says one child. ‘‘I’ll be the chief,”’ says 
another, and straightway proceeds to construct a

plot. If he proves resourceful, the other children 
rally about him and respond to his suggestions, 
applying their own knowledge of fact to the game. 
As they become interested in a part, they become 
stimulated to observe things related to in it real life. 
The part played vitalizes the interest by providing a 
social situation or background for the acquisition of 
facts. 
Likewise does observation grow in situations where 
stress is laid on behavior of different kinds. In 
representing people the child learns about good and 
bad, about cause and effect, naturally, without 
precept or admonition. Surely observation of good 
and evil in human nature is as important as observa- 
tion concerning the sense peculiarities of things. It 
is easy enough to waste time in making unnecessary 
sense discriminations, easy enough, also, to waste 
time in character portrayal. Yet, certain standards or 
types of human nature can be set forth with cameo- 
like clearness. ‘‘In life,” says Mrs. Herts, ‘“‘ youth 
could hardly discern the miser, spendthrift, liar, 
hypocrite, egoist, prodigal, swindler, gambler, patriot, 
martyr, and all the rest. Each quality is disguised 
and mixed with others. But the drama presents a 
large repertory of such simplified, elemental human 
qualities, admirably adjusted to the educative appren- 
ticeship stage of life. The primitive traits of which 
human nature is made up can be observed and studied 
as a mechanic studies a machine, part by part, before 
it is put together.’

Child Life, in The Dramatic Instinct in Children, p. 11, Monograph 352.

  44 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
Should Children Portray Evil? — Children often 
hunger to represent characters which they would 
shrink from in actual life. A boy likes to play thief 
and robber, even if delivered up to justice after a 
period of outlawry. ‘‘Give the boy of fifteen his 
chance to play a thief or a murderer on a stage in the 
costume and environment of the part,’ says Mrs. 
Herts; ‘‘he will usually experience all he wants of 
stealing and killing.’"' The consensus of opinion 
among educators seems to be that if children represent 
evil, the results of the evil should follow, either 
through portrayal of the suffering brought on by 
conscience, or through penalties imposed by society, 
and that evil characters which show neither result 
are not fit to be impersonated by children. On the 
whole this seems to the writer a commendable view- 
point, yet it remains to point out a limitation in it. 
It is quite possible to portray evil with such a lure and 
glamor that its results are lost sight of. It is still 
more important to keep the moral atmosphere clean 
and wholesome. If this is done, good and evil 
characters may come and go, each adding its impress 
to the mind, which, denying no evil, yet retains an 
enthusiasm for the good. 
A current article on motion pictures and crime? 
speaks of the extreme suggestibility of the mentally 
young or delinquent, who lack the ability to foresee 
the consequences of different kinds of behavior and 
lack the capacity and willingness to exercise self-

restraint. It mentions also the fact that delinquents 
possess imaginations less controlled and checked by 
realities. For this reason the author of the article 
favors eliminating reports of crime from the news- 
papers, magazines, moving pictures, and advertising 
posters. Another point remains to be made. Con- 
stant association with trivial characters in dramatiza- 
tion is almost as dangerous as with evil ones, for the 
mind has no height nor depth of interpretation in 
following such characters. Neither should the thought 
of the child be focussed entirely on ideal characters, 
since the result would be to picture conditions con- 
trary to facts in life. 
Emotions in Dramatic Play. — It remains to point 
out certain dangers in the line of emotional training 
through dramatization. It is so easy to arouse the 
emotions in dramatic play that there is always danger 
of overstimulation, especially in artificial situations. 
Most of us are familiar with an occasional person, at 
least, who has somehow grown accustomed to lead 
an emotional life apart from real persons and life situa- 
tions. The function of emotion is to guide and inspire 
conduct, not to act as a mere drug. It is possible to 
promote real growth in emotional control through 
tying up emotions with the right situations. This is 
an important function of dramatic play. 
Emotional growth through dramatic play is difficult 
to observe. The child tries on various types of 
emotional attitudes easily. He is stern and unrelent- 
ing when he plays policeman; kind and tender when 
nursing imaginary invalids; tryannical and cruel when. 
impersonating robbers and desperadoes. If such

    EDUCATION THROUGH DRAMATIC PLAYS 47 
plays are supervised the child learns to know unde- 
sirable emotions when he manifests them in dramatic 
play just as he does in life. In a good home evil 
deeds, selfish acts, and inconsiderate manners are 
eliminated by their social results. Good behavior 
meets with rewards; bad behavior is punished. 
Whether the dramatizing of evil characters leads to a 
repugnance or a toleration for evil depends upon the 
wholesomeness of the atmosphere. It is doubtful 
whether a child applies knowledge so gained to real 
life. In a crisis children sometimes repress facts 
which do not fall in with their desires. Many 
youthful crimes are committed by those who foresee 
results, but count on being clever enough to avoid 
them. Yet on the whole good training in dramatics 
cannot be entirely valueless. Children familiar with 
real or fictitious characters who are rewarded for 
suppressing undesirable fears, anger, self-feeling, and 
the like, and are punished for undesirable responses, 
have some advantage over children who have not had 
this vicarious experience. 
Dramatization and Habit.—So difficult is it to 
remake habits on the stage, that a well-known actor- 
manager has said, “‘Give me a gentleman and I'll 
produce an actor.’’ With children it is easy to create 
such a vital interest in a part that they set out to 
acquire the manners and customs required to portray 
it. This plasticity with respect to new habits should 
be made the most of educationally. 
Many children have enlarged their vocabularies 
through an appreciation of the language in dramatic 
games, and through impersonating characters in a
-P-A-G-E-60
  48 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
story. They lose self-consciousness and speak out 
the thoughts and ideas of the game or story with 
oftentimes real dramatic interpretation. If the story 
abounds in good dialogue they often repeat it ver- 
batim, thus appropriating to themselves the author’s 
vocabulary. 
Playing Before an Audience.— There comes a 
time when the normal child enjoys playing before an 
audience. When analyzed, the tendency appears to 
parallel the growth in the social personality at 
adolescence. The desire for attention and the love 
of display accompany us throughout life and it is but 
natural that these native tendencies should crop out 
with the growth of the social personality. To be 
the center of things brings an exhilaration, a sense of 
personal elation. Even to be part of an organized 
crowd participating in some concerted action is a 
form of excitement common to mankind. A whole 
range of human plays depend upon the reénforcement 
of feeling through group action; playing before an 
audience and participating in mass action in pageants 
or festivals are representative of these. 
What Part Should Imitation Play in Dramatic 
Interpretation? — Who has not seen the formalist 
crystallize every spontaneous expression into an art 
form? From the early kindergarten plays to the 
dramatics of college days, we sometimes see action 
artificially inspired in the players by outside inter- 
preters. How easy it is to change buoyant, spon- 
taneous expression into that over-facile copy of a 
teacher’s interpretation which lays the foundation for 
insincerity of expression! 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
EDUCATION THROUGH DRAMATIC PLAYS 49 
Our experts in plays and games are realizing the 
danger of excessive imitation in dramatic play, and are 
striving for originality in expression. Kindergartners 
are studying the spontaneous play responses of 
children of different ages as they represent bears, 
birds, fish, etc., to see what part the physiological 
requirements of the body play in determining the 
forms of dramatic art. When this is done, it becomes 
clear why children of about four years of age play 
bear on all fours, and why they assume an erect 
position at an age when competition in running is 
keen. It is clear, also, why children of kindergarten 
age representing birds spontaneously hop and fly in 
an erect position where the arms may aid in balancing 
the movements of the body. They seldom assume the 
conventional postures one used to see in kindergartens 
in which the child squatted on the floor with arms 
pinned to his side to represent wings. To one who 
understands the physiological and psychological rea- 
sons for these forms of dramatic interpretation, each 
type of expression is seen to have a function in the life 
of the growing organism. 
Cooperation the Result of Dramatic Play. — In 
dramatic games there is much that looks like social 
enjoyment. In this fellowship we see natural tenden- 
cies toward mastering and submissive behavior in 
different individuals of the group. In supervised 
dramatic play one child is not permitted to be ‘‘it’’ 
whenever he feels an overwhelming desire to display 
his powers. Children who seek to dominate are led 
to see the value of group codperation. In the Chil- 
ren’s Educational Theatre, New York City, the

  50 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
children who play the leading rdles one night shift 
scenery, hold the prompt-book, or act a minor part 
another night. They learn that intelligence and 
faithfulness are as much demanded in acting a minor 
as a major role. 
Imitative-dramatic Plays of Value in Supplementing 
Instinct. — Now that psychologists have discarded the 
theory of a single-minded instinct of imitation or of 
dramatization, we find imitative-dramatic plays much 
more difficult to analyze. In playing store, for 
example, a number of natural capacities and instincts 
are called into play. The instinct to manipulate, 
the desire for leadership, the enjoyment of playing a 
part, the love of physical activity — all these tenden- 
cies, and more, enter in and make the play a melting 
pot of habits, instincts, and tendencies. Because of 
the opportunity for interaction of all these tendencies, 
imitative-dramatic plays have an important biological 
significance. What-the child can learn by practice 
he is relieved from acquiring by heredity. Such seems 
to be the plan of life. (Imitative-dramatic plays not 
only supplement instincts, but aid in the reorganiza- 
tion of instincts. ) Unless we believe that ‘Nature 
must be right,’ we cannot afford to miss the chance 
such plays afford to help the child to learn new lessons 
and thus weaken the power of disadvantageous inborn 
tendencies. The hope of education during the play 
period and beyond lies in the thoroughgoing recon- 
struction of life through habits and reason. In 
supervised dramatic plays we have a real opportunity 
to tie up instinctive acts to good social habits.

CHAPTER IV 
Piayinc DoLit AND House 
Why Interest in House-plays is Universal. — There 
are several reasons why house-plays are universal in 
childhood. First, there is the frequency and famili- 
arity of the sights, sounds, and activities of the home. 
Secondly, and of more importance, many of the 
house activities such as washing, ironing, sweeping, 
and dusting commend themselves to a child because 
they fit his tendencies for multiform physical and 
mental activity of a simple, direct kind. Household 
activities which do not lend themselves readily to 
simple imitative acts are not so frequently dramatized; 
thus mending as a dramatic play is less popular than 
scrubbing, and reading and writing are less frequently 
dramatized than washing and ironing. Interest in 
dolls accounts for a large number of house-plays. 
The use of dolls involves a large number of original 
tendencies, among which are nurturing or motherly 
behavior, manipulation, desire for companionship, 
delight in dramatization, fetishism, collecting, and 
feelings of kindliness and sympathy. 
Doll-play Involves a Number of Original Tenden- 
cies. — The nurture of dolls, involving, as it does, 
motherly behavior toward inanimate objects, is one 
of the most interesting features of doll-play. What 
child does not love his rag doll? Most girls and boys 
St
-P-A-G-E-64
    
52 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
of two and three years of age will play contentedly 
for a long time with their dolls, hugging them close, 
petting them, kissing them tenderly, and singing to 
them. Soon the dramatic interest asserts itself. The 
dolls are made to eat, sleep, work, talk, play with 
other dolls, and, in fact, become personalities subject 
always to the child’s control. With children there is 
an age when a favorite doll may become almost a 
fetish. Some children sleep with their dolls, eat with 
them, and drag them along wherever they go: 
Pleasure in manipulation accounts for a large share 
of interest in dolls; their household utensils and 
clothes are objects calling this tendency into action. 
Some sex difference in doll-play is noticed even as 
early as the third year. As soon as the objects handled 
cease to attract because of their manipulative possi- 
bilities, many boys tire of household plays with dolls, 
while girls show an ever-increasing interest in practic- 
ing the arts and crafts of the home. It is possible to 
account for some of this difference in interest through 
the larger freedom usually given boys to roam about 
at will and seek other interests, while girls are kept 
more strictly at home, and thus often play with dolls 
because of mere lack of other interests. 
Habitation or desire for shelter, is noticeable in 
doll-play. The tendency to adopt cubby-holes for 
homes is strong. Dolls and their youthful proprietors 
frequently live and move and have their being under 
the sheltering arms of tables or chairs; overturned 
boxes make houses formidable to attack, and alcoves, 
recesses, or secluded clumps of trees are easily sug- 
gestive of domiciles.
-P-A-G-E-65
  PLAYING DOLL AND HOUSE 53 
Relative Frequency of Some Forms of Doll-play. — 
In a study of dolls it was found that, in answer to 
questions about the relative frequency of some forms 
of doll plays, ‘266 children mention a fondness for 
dressing dolls; 218 like to wash them; 189 have a 
love of doll parties; 183 a love of sewing for them; 176 
a love of playing school; 169 a love of putting to sleep; 
137 a love of weddings; 93 of nursing; 82 mention 
treating them as companions, telling secrets, etc.; 
79 love to feed them; 49 to punish them; 36 to play 
funerals.””! 
Years in Which Children Show the Most Interest 
in Dolls. — In the same study it was also found that 
the years from fourto fourteen were the ones in which 
there was the most universal interest in dolls, with a 
rapidly increasing interest at eight years. It was 
discovered that boys play with dolls as eagerly as 
girls, but for shorter periods, and that they show an 
especial fondness for character dolls. 
The Instinctive Basis for Nurturing or Mothering in 
House-plays. — The writer includes the nurture of 
dolls, pets, and babies in house-plays because the 
records of playing house show few plays where some 
form of nurture does not exist. There is possibly a 
basis in instinct for some of the interest in such plays. 
Of the mothering tendency Thorndike says: ‘‘ Whether 
the * * * holding, fondling, and petting babies, dolls, 
pets, and toys by the young require such special 
instincts or are explainable as the ‘real’ instincts, 
modified by complication or distortion of the situations 
and by training, I shall not try to decide. In any 
1G, Stanley Hall and A. Caswell Ellis: A Study of Dolls, p. 40.
-P-A-G-E-66
  54 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
case, in playful hunting, fighting, mothering, fleeing, 
home-making, and the like, training early permeates 
and overlays man’s original nature.” 
Educative Possibilities in Nurturing-play. — It is 
this modification of instinct through training which 
concerns parents and educators. Whenever a group 
of children gather together to play house, an educa- 
tional situation presents itself in which the mothering 
instinct of little girls, and the tendency boys show to 
make certain nurture responses, can be so guided that 
the right attitudes and habits toward the young and 
helpless are developed. There is every reason to 
‘believe that good example serves the same purpose in 
play that it does in any other situation in life. 
Groups of children learn to punish offenders and 
reward those who lend themselves to group purposes. 
In one house-play recorded a sister administering a 
spanking to a child playing with her was duly repri- 
manded and spanked by another child acting as the 
mother. A point to be remembered is that in super- 
vised play the teacher is near to see that good prevails 
in the end. Often a teacher possessing real under- 
standing of children can accomplish a good deal by 
herself assuming some role. Without ostentation she 
can depict a role which lends itself to valuable copy. 
Do the Habits and Attitudes Gained in Doll-play 
Carry Over Into Parenthood? — Doll-play affords 
much opportunity for the display of native traits of 
kindliness and sympathy, as well as their opposites, 
teasing and bullying. Many parents prohibit cruel 
1E. L. Thorndike: ‘The Original Nature of Man,” Educational 
Psychology, Vol. I, p. 146.
-P-A-G-E-67
  PLAYING DOLL AND HOUSE 55 
treatment of dolls on the same humanitarian ground 
as they would resent a similar treatment of pets. It 
seems to the writer that parents should make a neces- 
sary distinction between the treatment of dolls and 
toys, involving experimentation, such as cutting off a 
doll’s arms and legs in an effort to operate, and such 
treatment as beating a doll brutally when in a temper. 
Many spankings are not administered in a cruel 
spirit; they are rather experimental acts through 
which the youthful imitator gets the ‘‘feel” of adult 
acts. While we must allow for the importance of the 
laws of exercise and effect, we can attach only as 
much importance to harmless experimentation of this 
sort as we can to experimentation in kindliness and 
sympathy. Many youthful tyrants pet and fondle 
dolls just to try out such acts. A fondness for dolls 
does not necessarily indicate fondness for babies. 
Habits and attitudes gained in doll-play have only the 
same chance for later usefulness that habits of kindli- 
ness in any situation have to become a permanent basis 
for character. 
Manipulation as Applied to Household Utensils and 
Toys. — A little child, apart from training, pulls, pokes, 
and touches all objects within reach. This original 
tendency is of the utmost importance in understanding 
house-plays. Such objects as dolls, dishes, beds, 
chairs, washtubs, and stoves are much enjoyed by 
children before put to their real uses in dramatic play. 
This puttering of the fingers with objects and toys is 
noticeable in several of the records presented. Babies 
will sit for long periods fitting lids on pans, covers on 
jelly glasses, and small boxes into larger ones. It is 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  56 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
difficult to discover how much of form, size, and 
dimension they learn from puttering with the hands, 
ybut of this we may be sure, the end of finger play is 
knowledge. It is through puttering with the hands 
that children experiment with the things and forces of 
nature. The skill of the craftsman, the technique of 
    “Pittsburgh Playground Association 
Tue Hanpiinc of HousEeHorp UTENSILS AND Toys Is A 
Means or EpucatTIon To CHILDREN 
the artist, and the training of the scientist are all 
bound up in the use of the hands. When children first 
handle such household utensils as spoons, tin pans, 
cups, and the like, their attention centers upon such 
sense qualities as roughness, hardness, and sweetness. 
Soon, however, they learn the uses to which objects 
may be put; cups are to drink from, spoons to eat
-P-A-G-E-69
  
PLAYING DOLL AND HOUSE 57 
with. Itis then that their play with household objects 
is of the imitative sort. A little later, more freedom 
in the use of these objects is noticeable. A pan be- 
comes a drum, a tin can an engine bell, the clothesline 
a hose. Still later, make-believe no longer satisfies. 
The dolls must have a complete outfit; they must be 
dressed as children are dressed; their bed linen is not 
complete without the conventional sheets, blankets, 
and quilts; the table service must include necessary 
dishes, napkins, and tablecloth, while the cooking 
utensils must approximate reality. Tea parties be- 
come social affairs in which the children mimic the 
actions, bearing, and conversation of adults, exchang- 
ing greetings, inquiring after the health of sick babies, 
and discussing the general work of the home. Great 
ceremony attends the serving of meals, and woe be to 
the unfortunate child who through lack of vision or 
home training puts the skillet or kettle on the dining- 
room table! 
Can Specific Skills and Useful Habits be Taught 
in House-plays? — As has been mentioned in the 
discussion of the value of utilitarian play, the civilized 
child sets the table, washes dishes, scrubs floors, or 
performs the useful occupations of grown-ups, because 
by doing so he defines the meaning of such activities. 
That he may also acquire specific skill and useful 
habits is often lost sight of. Surely the educator 
would lose an opportunity did he not overlay with 
training the spontaneous interest in playing house. 
For example, there is no reason why children should 
not wash dolls’ clothes and dishes with real water and 
thus learn the elementary facts about laundering and
-P-A-G-E-70
  58 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
dishwashing. They may be shown, also, how to set 
the tea table attractively, how to make beds properly, 
how to scrub their dolls’ houses well, how to greet 
each other courteously; and shown spontaneously and 
naturally, as a part of the play or game.

Expansion of Plot Necessary to Meet More Complex 
Mental Interests. — Just as the physical equipment 
used in simple house-plays must be enlarged to meet 
the demand for increasing detail in dramatic play, so 
the expanding mental horizon necessitates a more 
complex plot. A house-play to a child seven or nine 
years of age is no longer a play in which dolls are 
merely nurtured and house furnishings manipulated. 
Rather does it embody a complex plot in which 
schools, churches, stores, industries, and commerce
-P-A-G-E-71
PLAYING DOLL AND HOUSE 59 
are established. Often a play is no more than started 
when some resourceful child says, ‘‘I’ll be a nurse,” 
and another, ‘‘My baby must be sent to the hospital.” 
But of such development in plot the records bear the 
best witness. 
RECORDS OF DRAMATIC PLAYS 
Playing Dolls and House 
1. Doll-Play. School of Childhood, University of 
Pittsburgh. — The play leader left two naked dolls on 
the table without calling attention to them. A little 
boy first discovered them and picked up the boy doll. 
Apparently not noticing the fact that the doll was 
undressed, he wheeled it proudly in a doll cab. His 
movements were so rapid that the play leader said, 
“Does Mother wheel babies so fast?’’ ‘No, nice 
and easy,” was the reply. In the meantime the girl 
doll had been taken up by a little boy, who gave it up 
readily when requested to do so by a little girl. 
“Where are its shoes?’’ asked the little girl; ‘I 
want to give her a bath.” After washing the doll 
carefully in a basin, the little girl asked for a towel. 
The play leader then produced an outfit of clothes, 
and the children put on each garment properly, 
carefully buttoning and adjusting each one. A group 
of children had gathered to watch the dressing of the 
dolls, and some of them built out of chairs a house in 
which the dolls could live. 
This outfit of clothes was carefully prepared in order to give the 
children skill in dressing and undressing and in buttoning and lacing 
the clothes of these large dolls. Previous to this the children had 
devised clothes for smaller dolls themselves.

this served as a 
shelf or table on 
which stood a 
washtub, an iron- 
ing-board, and an 
iron. Four little 
girls, about six 
years old, sat 
cosily around a 
tea table; one girl 
was drinking tea;

were nursing 
their dolls. The

knocked on the 
door to announce 
her visit. One of 
the children arose 
to let her in, bowed, and shook hands, then placed a 
chair at the table for the guest. ‘‘ How are you to-day?” 
said the visitor. ‘Oh, very well,’”’ replied the little 
girl, looking much pleased. She went to the stove 
and came back with two platters. ‘‘Have some meat 
and potatoes,’’ she said to the company. The visitor 
ate an imaginary dinner while the other children 
looked on with evident enjoyment. Soon the visitor 
said ‘‘Good-bye,”” and went home. The mother put 
the dishes in the little tub and washed them in water,     Photographed by Mary G. Wane

drying them carefully on a small tea towel. She 
arranged the dishes prettily on the shelf. The other 
children continued to play with their dolls. 
Such play affords opportunity to help the children form good 
habits in table manners, assists them to gain skill and neatness in 
setting a table and in washing dishes, and to gain courtesy and 
politeness in serving meals. 
  CoMPANY FOR DINNER 
3. Mother and Daughter. Arsenal Park. — Two 
children chose an alcove for a house and fenced it in 
with chairs to keep out intruders. Dolls, cup- 
boards, beds, a doll carriage, stove, and a table com- 
prised the house furnishings. ‘ You be the mother 
and I’ll be the daughter,” said an older girl to a new 
child, who was experiencing her first day in the 
playroom. ‘All right,’’ came the answer. The 
mother then bent over the washbtub, rubbing out 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  62 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
some doll sheets in imaginary water. “I’m washing 
the bedclothes,’’ she said to the daughter who had 
been out wheeling her doll. The daughter then took 
a cup and gave her doll a drink. This called the 
mother’s attention to the dishes. She left her 
washing and gathered up the cups and saucers, saying, 
“T’ll wash them.’’ But the daughter preferred to do 
this herself. She laid her doll on the bed, saying out 
loud to herself, ‘‘I must wash her face,’’ then took 
the dishes away from the mother. Without any 
feeling of loss of authority the mother allowed the 
daughter to take the dishes out of her hands and went 
back to the tub to finish the washing. She rubbed 
till the daughter had set away the dishes; then she 
took the dishes out again and washed them all. She 
next put an iron on the little stove. While it was 
heating, she went back for the sheet, folded it, and put 
it away. Just then her eyes lighted on the dolls. 
She took one out of bed and placed it in the cab ready for 
aride. The daughter appeared and forced her mother 
to give up the cab. The mother took the sheet she 
had just folded and covered the other doll with it. 
She rearranged the chairs, then took all the bedclothes 
off one bed and made up the other for the doll. A 
boy entered and began to arrange the saucers on the 
shelf. He placed the plates together in groups of 
three and set a cup between each group. ‘‘Who is 
he?”’ the supervisor asked. ‘‘He’s the pap,’’ answered 
the mother. The mother left the boy arranging the 
saucers in geometrical patterns and went out for a 
walk. She joined the daughter, who stood watching 
a group of children play house. Soon they both came 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
PLAYING DOLL AND HOUSE 63 
‘ home, bringing the doll in a cab. The ‘‘pap’’ had 
gone. The daughter put the doll in the small bed 
and tucked the clothes around it. The mother took 
the doll up again and wheeled it around the room, 
this time unmolested by the daughter, who was setting 
the table. Suddenly the daughter turned around and 
said to the mother, ‘‘Go over there to that house,” 
pointing to the children playing house. Before the 
mother had time to start, the daughter ran on ahead, 
getting there first. When the mother arrived, the 
daughter said to the other children, ‘‘That’s my 
mother.’’ The mother had wheeled her doll over. 
As she took the doll out of the cab, the daughter 
pointed to it and said, ‘“She’s had smallpox.’’ The 
children in the house went on with their play undis- 
turbed by this announcement; one child was pressing 
a sheet with a warm iron; another child was dressing 
her dolls; still another sat on the floor, playing with a 
toy stove, taking the lids out and fitting them in again. 
The mother soon decided to go home. The first 
thing she did on returning was to wash the dishes. 
Then she stood a while and watched the daughter, 
who had persuaded the children in the other house 
to come out and play Ring Around the Rosy. After 
a few minutes the mother set the table. The daughter 
returned home with her doll and handed it to her 
mother, then joined some children who were playing 
on the slide. The mother wrapped the doll in a 
sheet, and, still holding it, tried to clear the table; 
this proved hard to do, so she put the doll to bed. 
She became so absorbed in watching the children slide 
that she stood doing nothing for some time. After a 
   
-P-A-G-E-76
  64 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
while she swept the floor. A big boy tried to break 
in the house, and the mother called to the daughter 
to put him out. Just then the play leader said, 
“Time to put the toys away.” 
This play lasted forty minutes. The writer presents it in a full 
narrative form just as she saw it work out, because it is a clear 
example of a type of spontaneous, unsupervised house-play natural 
to children under six where the play is left on the plane of instinct. 
To the casual reader it may seem that no thread of purpose runs 
through the play. The children’s interest shifted rapidly from 
the dolls to the dishes and to each other; yet each thing they did was 
_ of absorbing interest to them. Every act partook of the nature of 
work; yet to them it was play because they chose what to do and 
how to do it. The mother was working out a new adjustment. 
She recognized that the daughter possessed a knowledge of the 
environment that she herself did not possess; hence she was glad to 
be told what to do. The doing was absorbing enough in itself. 
She liked to touch, to feel, and to handle the new playthings, dis- 
covering various social uses to which they could be put. The 
daughter had a clearer idea of what she wanted to do; chiefly, she 
liked to exert power, to lead, control, and plan the actions of the 
mother. Unconsciously she was developing leadership, for good 
or evil, and was impressing upon another her own tastes and habits. 
To the educator this play is teeming with values which need to be 
sifted, and freighted with social meaning. When interest in manip- 
ulation is at its height how much skill in handling objects can 
reasonably be expected? What attitudes toward homemaking are 
established in the undemocratic atmosphere this home depicts? 
How far was the subservient attitude of the mother due to her 
unfamiliarity with the new environment and how far to innate 
docility in the presence of masterly behavior on another’s part? 
All these questions would interest a psychologist who aims to build 
upon natural capacities in suggesting procedure of a higher order. 
4. Vaccination. Lawrence Park. — Several girls 
made individual houses by marking off a space on the 
floor. They built tables, chairs, and beds of blocks, 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
  PLAYING DOLL AND HOUSE 65 
then played that their dolls were ill. (There had 
been a smallpox scare in the neighborhood and many 
of the children had been vaccinated.) Some of the 
boys played they were doctors. The girls carried the 
dolls to the doctor’s office and had them vaccinated. 
Each doll came home with a mark on its arm. 
See the development of this type of play in Hospital Play, No. 1. 
5. Making Dolls’ Houses. Washington Park. — 
The younger children wanted to have a doll’s house 
that would “‘keep.”’ The play leader provided a 
large wooden box and the children suggested having a 
downstairs and an upstairs, so a board was nailed 
in to form a partition. The floors and walls were 
scrubbed clean. A little girl suggested papering the 
walls. The following day the children were given 
manila paper and colored crayon with which to design 
wall-paper. Those making the best patterns were 
allowed to paper a room. The next day the children 
were given blue cardboard and white strips of various 
width to experiment with in making striped rugs. 
The best rugs were placed on the two floors. Some 
of the older girls sewed and tacked up white window 
curtains. Because a kitchen and dining room were 
needed downstairs the large room had to be partitioned 
into two rooms. The upstairs was left as it was for a 
bedroom. For the kitchen, the children suggested 
having a small table, a cupboard, and one chair; for 
the dining room a large table, a sideboard, and four 
chairs. The bedroom was to have two beds and two 
chairs. Uneeda biscuit boxes were brought out by 
the play leader for the furniture. The children

helped to plan and make each piece. When it was 
done they wanted to varnish the furniture. It was 
placed on a table which was covered with newspapers 
and each child was allowed to put on one coat of 
shellac. The next day the children arranged the 
furniture in the three rooms, brought out the ‘‘Do 
With Dolls,’”’ and played house all the afternoon. For 
several weeks the dolls’ house was the center of 
interest. The dolls were taken for daily rides in the 
doll buggies, and were put through many kinds of 
housework. The father doll was usually taken away 
to work at some occupation and brought home at 
meal time. 
6. Canning Fruit. Lawrence Park.—The children 
of this playroom were often taken to a small farm 
near the playground. Here they saw several kinds of 
fruit trees. One day they played they were canning 
fruit. Each child made a separate house by parti- 
tioning off a space on the floor, and built a stove with 
blocks. The girls played canning fruit and making 
jelly, using large wooden cylinders for the jars; they 
arranged the jars on a shelf. The boys offered to 
carry the jars down cellar; this necessitated extending 
the space of each house a little. Some of the girls 
took jars of fruit to their neighbors. 
There is no reason why children may not play as spontaneously 
in making real jelly as in pretending to make jelly, and where 
facilities permit this is often done in the playrooms. 
7. Party. Lawrence Park. — One child announced 
that it was her birthday. She wrote invitations 
to a party and delivered them to her girl friends. 
They came and played games. After the interest in
-P-A-G-E-80
    68 SPONTANEOUS AND .SUPERVISED PLAY 
games had worn out, the hostess suggested a boat ride. 
She placed chairs on a table for a boat and the girls 
jumped in. Two boys offered to be the crew. One 
girl jumped overboard and was rescued by members 
of the crew, who swam in after her and together 
carried her to a hospital. The other girls went home, 
forgetting to say good-bye to their hostess. 
Note the opportunity for playful acquiring of habits of courtesy 
and politeness. 
8. House, School, and Hotel. Lawrence Park. — 
One day the play leader introduced the thought of 
promptness into the house-plays. She showed the 
children how to make little clocks for their houses. 
One group of children kept a hotel. Several children 
came there to stay all night and asked to be called at 
acertain time. They lay down to sleep and the clerk 
got them up at the time they requested him to call 
them. Another group of children played school. 
The teacher told them to come at nine o’clock and 
rang the bell at that time. At noon she sent the 
children home to dinner. Some of them planned to 
be late. When they came back to school the teacher 
wrote their names on the board and kept them after 
the other children had gone home. 
9. A Sick Doll. Lawrence Park. — A house was 
made at one end of the playroom by partitioning off a 
space with chairs. In the house sat a little girl 
holding a sick doll. Near by stood a tub of water. 
She wrung out a cloth in the water and carefully 
washed the doll’s face, then took a dry cloth and 
bound around its wrist. ‘‘It takes every rag I can 
get,’ she said aloud to herself.

  to. Getting Spanked. Lawrence Park.—A tea 
table behind a screen represented the home. The 
family were a mother, a young girl, and an older girl 
who was ironing. The mother went away. The 
young girl sat down at the table to drink some tea. 
She spilled the water on the oilcloth, whereupon the 
older girl left her ironing to give her a spanking. A 
small boy was playing near by. He saw the spanking 
and came over to comfort the girl, saying, ‘‘ Never 
mind!”” Then he went back to his play. He was 
George Washington chopping down a cherry tree! 
But the mother had seen the disturbance. She came 
running home and administered a spanking to the 
older girl.

BUILDING PLAYHOUSES 
This play shows the importance of imitation in discipline. It is 
evident that the pattern had been set at home and that spilling 
anything on the table was a punishable offense in at least one home. 
The boy’s protective instinct and the mother’s higher sense of 
justice are good examples of spontaneous kindliness and resistance 
to injustice. In regard to a situation calculated to produce a 
display of kindliness, Thorndike says: ‘‘ The situation ‘a living thing | 
displaying hungry, frightened, or pained behavior by wailing, cling- 
ing, holding out its arms and the like’ provokes attention and 
discomfort, and may, if attendant circumstances do not shunt 
behavior over to the hunting, avoiding, or triumphing responses, 
provoke acts of relief.’”! 
11. House and Restaurant. Lawrence Park. — 
A group of ten girls and one boy, all about nine or 
ten years old, started a restaurant. They arranged 
1E. L. Thorndike: “The Original Nature of Man,” Educational 
Psychology, Vol. I, pp. 102-103.
-P-A-G-E-83
  PLAYING DOLL AND HOUSE 7a 
tables in a long row and covered them with white 
wrapping paper to represent a tablecloth. Two girls 
washed and wiped the aluminum dishes and two 
others set the table. The boy announced that he 
would take in the money and seated himself at a table 
near the entrance. When some of the cooks had 
prepared an imaginary dinner on two toy stoves, they 
put on white paper caps and aprons and stood behind 
the long rows of tables. Then the clerk rang a bell 
long and loudly. All the other children in the play- 
room left their games to see what was going on. 
From those entering the restaurant the clerk insisted 
on advance payment for the dinner, so some of the 
children ran home to get paper money. The clerk 
gave each child the proper change after deducting the 
price of a meal. The dinner proved exciting, for if 
the boarders did not get waited on at once, they 
shouted out what they wanted. So the play leader 
stepped in and quietly supervised the ordering of 
meals. One mother did not get served as soon as she 
wished and left the restaurant in indignation, carrying 
her doll in her arms. Another child ordered roast 
beef and a cup of tea; still another ordered corned 
beef. All ate the imaginary dinner with much satis- 
faction. When they had finished and gone home the 
waitresses cleared the table; the cooks washed the 
dishes, and the clerk counted the money. Then the 
same play started over again. 
Interest in this play persisted for several days. It gave each 
child some principal réle to enact. The cooks, waitresses, and clerk 
had interesting tasks to perform, tasks which permitted manipula- 
tion of materials and adjustments to people. It was interesting
-P-A-G-E-84
    72 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
to see how the children mimicked the manners of their elders. See 
here also the rich opportunity for giving through imitation ideas of 
politeness and good table manners and for teaching the processes 
involved in making change and toemphasize essentials in a good diet. 
1z. A Community Play. Greenfield School Play- 
ground.'! — ‘‘As a result of the summer’s play my pro- 
gram can be summed 
up as a series of 
plays which grew out 
of the contact with 
human nature. The 
plays and games tell 
the story of the hu- 
man family in all its 
relationships. 
“The community 
play began by several 
children choosing for 
a home a_ perfectly 
natural alcove made 
of bushes. The first 
few days were spent in 
organizing the family 
and placing them in 
their natural environment. Out of this grew man’s 
needs for the promotion of his physical welfare. Stones 
were chosen out of which to construct a stove and an old 
bucket was found for a cooking utensil. The materials 
used for cooking were sand for cakes, daisies for 
potatoes, grass for salad, and the yellow center of 
  A Primitive SHELTER 
1 This play was developed and described by Kathleen McSweeney 
and is presented in her own words. 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
  
PLAYING DOLL AND HOUSE 73 
daisies for eggs. A box served as a table, milk-bottle 
tops became dishes, and paper was cut into table- 
clothes and napkins. Then dinner was served. The 
next day’s plan was similar except that everything 
was worked out with more detail. The following day 
a dominant note was struck in this living program 
when another family was chosen, Auntie and 
Cousin who lived next door, thus introducing man’s 
craving for social relationship. The Auntie and 
Cousin visited the family and stayed for tea. When 
one of the children said ‘How do you do?’ she shook 
hands. This seemed a good opportunity to introduce 
the visiting game, ‘We Go Across the Street.’ 
“The following day came the idea of commercial 
relationship. A group of boys started a store. The 
next day more stores sprang up, a fruit store, a 
grocery, and a meat market. This led to a division of 
labor. Day by day the field of play widened until it 
unfolded in the building of a city. Wheelbarrows 
served as delivery wagons and suggested the need of 
drivers and hucksters. The following day some one 
spoke of the need for money, so a bank was incor- 
porated. One of the boys chose to be a banker and 
took a corps of assistants. Money was made from 
milk-bottle tops. Each storekeeper and older citizen 
was supplied with a bank book. When they came to 
the bank they brought these books and deposited and 
drew money. The clerk kept a careful record of ail 
the transactions. 
“A new family was added the tollowing day. The 
other families called upon their new neighbors. Asa 
means of entertainment the hostess was invited to 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
  74 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
tell a story; this story hour was enjoyed and repeated 
at the other houses, with singing. 
““Now the mothers found a school absolutely neces- 
sary. The children were dressed and sent to school. 
At recess they went out in the schoolyard for games. 
At noon the children were dismissed for luncheon and 
at the sound of the bell returned to school. One day 
some one suggested a holiday. Every one in the city 
took Saturday afternoon off and went to the woods or 
games. The next day was Sunday and all went to 
church. Up to the tent they marched, seated them- 
selves on the benches and sang ‘America’; then church 
was considered over. Monday the stores reopened 
and school commenced. k 
“One day a new note of interest was introduced by 
the children suggesting the need of a telephone. The 
following day a telephone was evolved from spool 
boxes, cord, and a spool. The children took much 
pleasure in telephoning to the stores, homes, etc. 
A few days later the play broadened when imaginary 
fire broke out in one of the stores. A volunteer fire 
company was organized; the express wagon became a 
hose cart, and a company of children with buckets 
started to put out the fire. 
“One of the most interesting parts of this play is in 
connection with the selection of roles. The same 
group of children continually played the same parts. 
One little girl who was the first little mother in the 
home played the same réle every day until the end of 
the season. This seems to indicate that to each and 
every one of the children the experience was a vital 
one. The following summer the children who had
-P-A-G-E-87
  PLAYING DOLL AND HOUSE 75 
taken part in this play the summer before requested 
to play again the same drama and enact the same 
roles.” 
Here again we see a social situation in which the enjoyment of 
habitation, the instinct of manipulation, and the social instincts 
were utilized in a neighborhood approaching a community center. 
The children felt the need of stores, banks, and schools. This need 
could have been made the basis for teaching skills in home-making, 
in banking processes, and in businesslike procedure in the stores. 
Arithmetic enters in as a factor in filling orders, while problems 
in engineering engage the attention of those who plan and lay out 
streets or install telephone systems. 
13. A House Play.!— ‘‘The two play houses on 
the porch came to be considered as an established part 
of the playground. There were two complete families. 
The little girl who took charge of the homes was very 
capable. She ordered the daily events in the homes 
much as her own mother must have done. The older 
children were put to work while the younger ones were 
sent to school. Meals were served regularly. At 
first the children used stones, straws, and the like for 
food, but in a short time they brought a few foods, 
such as crackers and fruit from home. The play 
went on daily, and although the members of each 
family changed and the routine of management was 
altered at times, there were very few days when the 
play itself was neglected.” 
Play 13 is similar in content to several previously described, 
but affords too good an example of children’s growth in the use of 
mental imagery to escape special mention. The play leader com- 
ments on the fact that stones, straws, etc., were first used for food, 
but that, later, real food supplanted imaginary supplies; that is,

there had come an inner necessity for the objects used to resemble 
reality with some degree of fitness fiction failed to satisfy. As 
we have said before, this interest in detail comes some time after 
the seventh year, when the more definite working out of mental 
images necessitates actual truth in representation. 
The second point worthy of comment in both Play 13 and the 
one preceding it is the permanence of the dramatic form. The little 
homes and the activities connected with them had become a part 
of the equipment of the playground, physical and social. A space 
was reserved for the homes, and certain children were recognized as 
responsible for certain rdles. These facts seem significant in 
showing how play interests carry over from day to day and become 
habit-forming agencies in the lives of children.

   Why Children Like to Play Store.— Store as a 
dramatic play demands the presence of other children 
in a happy give and take of social amenities. Children 
enjoy experimenting with the actions of people as well 
as with the properties of things and the trade and 
barter of merchandise afford an opportunity for much 
human experimenting. 
Two or three children codperate for mutual advan- 
tage, and native ability in leadership is sure to appear. 
A child gifted with social graces and tact often prefers 
to sell, while one whose interest is in motor activities 
likes to become a driver or to perform the active 
physical work about the store. 
Manipulation. — Manipulation of materials is also 
pleasurable and is partly responsible for the interest 
children take in store-plays. Little children seem to 
take a spontaneous delight in hoarding objects to use 
in store-plays; partly for the joy of manipulating such 
objects, but also because of a native tendency to hoard 
and collect. 
Collecting. — Interest in collecting accounts for 
part of children’s interest in store-plays. As early as 
the last part of the second year the tendency to 
collect sticks, stones, spools, bottles, and the like is 
oticeable. The collecting of valueless objécts con- 
inues all through childhood, indeed, throughout life. 
77  
-P-A-G-E-90
  78 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
There is a good deal of variation in the objects collect- 
ed. Objects of a certain kind are usually collected 
because they are present in the immediate environ- 
ment; thus children in the country collect acorns, 
twigs, or stones, while those in the city collect cigar 
boxes, medals, etc. Objects cherished dearly at one 
moment are surrendered carelessly at another as 
interests change. The sight of another person collect- 
ing objects is enough to awaken a like desire to possess. 
Children under four years of age are likely to collect 
anything they can lay hands upon. I once observed 
for a period of three days a play of a four-year-old 
child involving collecting. It was a crude kind of 
store play. On the store counter improvised from 
several long boards were spread out the following 
articles: a mouse trap, a toy ambulance, a bear, a 
horse, a cart, a gun, an oleomargarine box, a baking- 
powder can, paper cookies, blocks to represent sticks 
of candy, a pencil, a buttonhook, a wheel, castors, a 
knife, toy dishes, and celluloid animals. A few of 
these various articles were at first arranged in rows to 
represent sticks of candy or rows of cookies. But as 
the range of objects grew, the articles were displayed 
without system. Doubtless this last was because of 
lack of space. The objects were still classified in the| 
boy’s mind, however, for whenever I inquired abou 
some article, such as coffee or sugar, which none of hi 
articles resembled, he promptly gave some such repl 
as ‘“‘I haven’t any, but doesn’t your little boy want 
gun or some bread?’’ It seemed that the basis o! 
classification in the boy’s mind was size and shape 
I had noticed this tendency in other children. Recor

2 shows children’s use of wooden beads, cubes, spheres, 
and cylinders to represent objects in a grocery store. 
When customers asked for a particular kind of fruit or 
vegetable the children selected beads most nearly 
resembling the shape of the article demanded. This 
was their way of classifying for shape. 
Children of kindergarten age show some interest in 
arranging and classifying the objects they collect. 
In playing store, for example, sugar is kept in one 
place, bread in another, and potatoes in another. All 
things are not sold in one store; one child keeps a 
grocery store, another a meat market, and another a 
bakery. 
Progression in the Collecting Interest is Due to 
Age. — Miss Burk found the collecting interest to be 
present at six years of age, and to continue through the 
seventeenth year. She states that the time of greatest 
interest in collecting is between nine and ten years, 
when the average number of collections per child is 
4.4. She places the first classifications appearing 
after nine or ten years of age on the basis of color 
and size, while classifications of kind come a little 
later. What a child collects, according to Burk, 
depends largely on the environment. When rivalry 
lenters into collecting the aim seems to be to outstrip 
thers in numbers.!. This kind of collecting is less 
common to store play than is that in which arrange- 
ent or order becomes the important feature. Thus 
tore plays may become a source of really scientific 
raining in the use of objects. ‘

Collecting as Related to the Hunting Interest.— 
Probably one reason 
why interest in col- 
lecting is greatest in 
the pre-adolescent 
period is the fact that 
the desire to roam 
about, to find, and to 
hunt is strong in this 
period. In succeeding 
years the interest 
wanes or becomes a 
fad, such as the col- 
lecting of souvenir 
spoons or dance pro- 
grams. 
Information Gained in Playing Store. — A great 
deal of information about materials and processes of 
manufacturing is picked up in connection with store 
plays. The child who has a dry-goods store learns} 
about such materials as silk, linen, cotton, and wool. 
  COLLECTING 
By means of pictures and stories he may be show: 
interesting facts about raw products and about thi 
machinery converting these products into material 
for clothing. If he keeps a grocery store he learn 
about food stuffs. His interest is easily enlisted i 
sources and processes by which meat, butter, milk 
cereals, and vegetables come to us. Or he may becom 
a hardware merchant and learn about tin, iron, an 
copper, and about the processes each undergoes befor 
it reaches the consumer.
-P-A-G-E-93
PLAYING STORE 81 
Scrap-books a Source of Information. — In con- 
‘nection with store plays children can be stimulated 
to make scrap-books illustrating food products and 
the changes these products undergo before they reach 
the consumer, also to make scrap-books illustrating 
clothing materials and the corresponding processes 
of manufacture. Current magazines and advertising 
catalogs abound in such pictures. Other kinds of 
scrap-books which are related to the collecting interest 
are travel books which appeal to the child’s love of 
adventure, machinery scrap-books, bird and animal 
scrap-books, and ‘‘Who, When, and What’’ scrap- 
books. Children’s librarians make use of the collect- 
ing instinct by telling stories which the children 
illustrate in scrap-books. The children cut out of 
magazines pictures of scenes, people, and activities 
described in a story and paste these pictures into a 
scrap-book. Nature-study teachers make use of 
interest in collecting by stimulating children to make 
their own collections of plants and animals. 
Information Regarding Money Values and Stand- 
rd Weights and Measures. — With interest in detail 
f various kinds comes the demand for money and 
tandard weights and measures. Many schools are 
tilizing store plays in thrift instruction to teach the 
value of money and to give real experiences in weigh- 
ng and measuring. The school children are also 
aken to the stores; are required to buy with real 
oney, and to report on the weight and measure of the 
rticles purchased. On the playground the children 
ften use milk-bottle tops for money. These tops 
an be purchased in quantity. When the children

    1. Store—A Home Play.— One day R built a 
hollow square counter and arranged on it a collection 
of blocks of different sizes. ‘‘What are these?” I 
asked. ‘‘These are sticks of candy,” he said, pointing 
to pillar-shaped blocks. ‘‘There are margarine,” 
showing me a pile of oblong blocks, and ‘‘Here are 
eggs,’ pointing to a row of small wooden wheels. I 
suspect the classification and arrangement of blocks 
would have gone further, but for the diversity in size 
of the blocks he had collected. At any rate, selling 
now interested him more than collecting and I was 
forced to be a customer, ordering by telephone groceries 
which were delivered promptly to the chair where I 
sat reading. Play money was furnished me, and I 
was expected to pay for each article received. 
The following day I assisted R to build a long} 
counter out of boards. We placed the support: 
under the counter. R, not finding a suitable plac 
on the counter in which to arrange classified material 
exclaimed, ‘‘It won’t do!’’ Then, seeing the drawer 
underneath, he began to arrange his playthings an 
blocks in sections. When I asked for candy o 
cookies he weighed his materials on the kitchen scale 
and wrapped them in paper which he had rolled aroun 
a stick to imitate a grocer’s roll.

   2. Store. Washington Park Playroom. — Three 
four-year-old children enjoyed playing a simple game 
of store. They asked the play leader for a box of large 
wooden beads containing spheres, cubes, and cylinders. 
When anyone came to the store, these children said, 
“What do you want ?’’ then searched in the box for a 
bead the shape of which resembled the object named. 
One day they asked for the scales and weighed each 
object before selling it. 
3. Grocery Store. Andrews School Playground.— 
One boy kept a grocery store. Another boy played 
farmer. The farmer molded wet sand into all kinds 
of shapes, naming each shape after some vegetable. 
He then brought his vegetables to the storekeeper, 
who sold them to other children. 
4. Lumber Yard.— Near the grocery just de- 
scribed a group of boys piled up blocks to represent a 
lumber yard. They sold lumber to customers. 
5. Drug Store. A Home Play. — Two little girls 
selected a box to represent a counter for their store. 
They collected bottles of various sizes and filled them 
with colored water. Red and pink were made from 
cinnamon candy, and blue and black from ink. 
Then, as interest in mixing colors grew, the girls 
lexperimented with paints until they had mixed almost 
levery imaginable color. They showed the collection 
f filled bottles to all the people in the neighborhood, 
ut never thought of selling. 
It is clear that to those eight-year-old girls the joy of collecting 
ind experimenting with color was stronger than interest in trade and 
arter.

6. Farm and Store. Sullivan Playground. — Two 
boys started a store. Other boys in the group volun- 
teered to be farmers. A group of girls offered to 
codéperate. The boys planted vegetables, then called 
upon the girls to assist in gathering the crops. One 
farmer loaded an express wagon with tin buckets full 
of vegetables (grass, stones, and sand) and took them 
to the store. The storekeeper bought the vegetables, 
then closed his store, saying it was night. After a 
short rest he set out the baskets of vegetables on the 
counter and said it was morning. A number of 
children then came to buy. 
7. Millinery Store. Washington Park. — A group 
of girls eight or nine years old started a millinery store. 
They set to work making hats out of tissue paper of| 
varioug colors. They cut and sewed the hats, then|

trimmed them with tissue-paper bows, flowers, and 
feathers. They hung up a sign and several girls came 
to the store to buy. The older customers found 1% 
great fun to try on the hats; usually a selection was 
made only after trying on several hats. The six-year- 
old children often took the first hats they saw.     
   
       
     
     
   
   
   
   
      
         With the girls from eight to nine, the point of the play was the 
constructive interest, although the dramatic interest ran almost as 
high. With the younger children, buying was the point of interest. 
8. Grocery Store. South Side Playground. — 
Some boys and girls, eight and ten years old, had great 
fun collecting objects for their store. They brought 
from home sample boxes of cocoa, chocolate, and 
cream of wheat, arranging the articles quite artistically 
lon the counter. Each purchaser was shown every- 
thing in the store before he was permitted to tell what 
e wanted to buy. When he made his choice, the 
aackage was wrapped in brown paper, tied with string, 
nd handed to him by a clerk who invariably assumed 
n air of importance. 
9. Store. O’Hara School Playground. — Two 
arge dry-goods boxes served asa counter. An elabo- 
ate cash box was constructed out of a tin can and a 
iece of string. Whenever a customer paid for goods 
he clerk put the paper money in the cash box and 
ulled a string which carried the box up to a wire; he 
hen slid the box over to the cashier, who examined the 
oney and sent the change back to the clerk. In this 
tore the buckets, hoops, sand tines, shovels, balls, 
lacks, and other toys were sold to children in exchange 
lor paper money. At the close of each morning’s 
lession these playthings were returned by the children.

using them to the storekeeper, who put them away

EDUCATIONAL POSSIBILITIES IN PLAYING STORE 
Store-Play in Connection With School Work. — 
Store-plays are becoming an integral part of a liberal 
primary school education; indeed, we might almost 
say of the elementary school as well; and yet the real 
possibilities of such play represent almost an un- 
touched field. The subject seems worthy of a fuller 
discussion than was given in connection with spon- 
taneous play. 
Sense Education, Memory Work, Drill, and Atten- 
tion as Used in Playing Store.— Public school 
education places stress on situations in which training 
in sense perception, memory, and attention can be 
directed toward educational ends. Store-plays afford 
an opportunity for such training through providing} 
social situations in which the native tendencies t 
collect, to manipulate, and to act in social ways ai 
and abet the teacher’s efforts to secure the resul 
desired. For example, after children have collecte 
objects with which to play store, they can be helpe 
to improve the collections and to arrange them wit 
some regard for scientific method or esthetic appre 
ciation. The quality of the collections is thus im 
proved and sense education can proceed on a highe: 
plane. Attention to the objects collected and arrange 
is of the spontaneous kind, and the wide range o 
most children’s collections tends to bring a breadth o 
interest. Memory drill and review concerning th     
      
    
            
      
     
-P-A-G-E-99
PLAYING STORE 87 
objects collected and their place in relation to some 
social, economic, or scientific system is a matter of 
spontaneous attention. It takes effort to stand the 
strain of drill where no play interest is present, and 
the social store-play helps to bridge the chasm between 
spontaneous and sustained attention. 
These points can best be made clear through con- 
crete examples accompanied by illustrations con- 
cerning the part the thinking processes play in such 
dramatic games as store-play. 
Grocery Store 
Sense Education Through Playing Store. — The 
study of foods and of textiles, also the training for 
some degree of efficiency in the use of both, are a part 
of industrial education in the elementary school. 
What better opportunity to learn about foods than 
through actual manipulation of real objects in a 
dramatic game? Time should be allowed, especially 
with smaller children, to touch, look at, lift, and 
perhaps smell and taste the objects handled. The 
power to observe can be improved steadily up to the 
fifteenth year. Children can be urged to take another 
look where first impressions have been inadequate, 
and then required to verify the second observation. 
Let them combine muscle sense with tactual experience 
and in this way get larger sense data. Memory drill 
can be utilized, too, when interest is high. 
Knowledge of Production of Food Stuffs. — In 
progressive schools children are taken on excursions 
to visit farms where produce is raised, factories where 
it is preserved and canned, and shipping houses and
-P-A-G-E-100
   
           
    
                                     
    
   88 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
freight depots through which it is brought to the 
consumer. Children’s native curiosity naturally leads 
to their gaining information from books concerning 
each place visited. Our libraries abound in good 
children’s literature regarding farm life and the trans- 
portation industry, and interesting facts can be gained 
in supplementary reading lessons. 
How to Develop Arithmetic Through Playing 
Store.— Children in both urban and rural com- 
munities have a close acquaintance with grocery stores. 
They are sent there to purchase a quart of this, and 
a pint of that; a peck of this, and a bushel of that; 
three of this, a dozen of that. They know some- 
thing about the qualities of the objects purchased; at 
least, they can be taught to be discriminative buyers 
and to count their change after paying for things. 
In spontaneous play children often fail to develop 
exactness in measuring, accuracy in distinguishing 
good objects from poor ones, and correctness in 
making change. But where store games are made 
the centers of correlation for arithmetic work, chil- 
dren’s attention can be directed toward these ends and 
instruction can become an integral part of play. To 
carry on such instruction the school equipment should 
include standard scales and measures, also a toy 
currency system. Children can contribute other 
necessary materials. It is easy to collect a bushel of 
potatoes, a peck of apples, bran, oatmeal, or othe: 
materials required for experience in weighing. Th 
teacher or a committee can have charge of the care o 
all such materials; and a group of children can pla’ 
the store, select its personnel, and simulate the socia 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
  
PLAYING STORE 89 
and economic background of a real store. The 
responsibility for correct weighing and measuring 
should vary according to the ages of the children. 
Even children of kindergarten age can bear some 
responsibility for counting and measuring. With 
older children a system of bookkeeping can be estab- 
lished and the pupils held strictly responsible for errors 
in slips and entries in the ledger. Forfeiture of the 
right to play a réle is usually sufficient penalty for 
carelessness in manipulating money and figures; for 
at the ages when a system of accounting can be intro- 
duced children have so developed the sense of re- 
sponsibility that social disapproval is a punishment in 
itself. 
Reading and Writing. — Many children learn to 
read by spontaneous attention to signs on grocery 
wagons or to labels on boxes. A printing equipment 
makes it possible for children to label articles in their 
stores, price them, and thus gradually associate objects 
with their printed symbols. This can be done even 
in the kindergarten, although such material and the 
use of it is more properly a part of the primary school 
equipment. 
Buying as a Means of Learning About Sources of 
Food Supply. — Children can learn a great deal about 
sources of food supply by taking excursions in groups 
to examine supplies. With little children the middle 
man can be dispensed with. They can make a visit 
to a farm, if they live in an agricultural community; 
if not, they can see a community garden and examine 
at first hand the produce which is being grown for the 
markets. Where no visits of this kind can be ar- 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
90 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
ranged, something can be gained through a study of 
catalogs. Many factories advertise their products 
through pictures showing the processes which food 
undergoes in being transformed from a raw state to 
marketable commodities. Children like to make 
scrap-books showing the history of the foods they use 
on the table; they acquire much information from 
such collections of pictures. 
Dry-Goods Store 
Knowledge Concerning Textiles and Industrial 
Processes Connected With Them. — Clothing repre- 
sents another vital interest in childhood. As the 
elementary schools endeavor to give children some 
knowledge of textiles and the processes involved in 
transforming raw materials into clothing and house 
furnishings, so store plays dealing with textiles have 
an important function in the industrial program. I 
do not refer alone to such plays as were listed in the 
examples of spontaneous play, but also to games of 
store in which children share somewhat in the proc- 
esses through which raw materials are changed into 
usable commodities. Children no longer spin and 
weave in the home, but they can be shown the essentials 
of these processes through the use of hand looms and 
through visits to factories where machine processes 
are in operation. Let the children collect linen, 
cotton, silk, and wool to use in playing store. Give 
information which is simple and practical so that they 
can detect cotton, wool, silk, and mixed goods by 
muscular and tactual tests. Help them to see the 
practical considerations of buying clothing materials
-P-A-G-E-103
  PLAYING STORE gI 
for hygienic and utilitarian purposes as well as for 
attractiveness. This can be done by providing a large 
variety of samples to be used in making doll clothes, 
airplane wings, and sails for boats. 
Training in Arithmetic.— Still other types of 
arithmetical work enter into the dramatization of 
dry-goods stores. The children estimate the amount 
of material needed for dolls’ garments as they measure 
for curtains or rugs in a doll’s house. Children acting 
as clerks are expected to measure the goods ordered, 
and to compute the price of the amount purchased. 
For equipment the school should furnish scissors, tape 
measures, thimbles, wrapping paper, etc., while the 
children should contribute pieces of linen, wool, silk, 
and cotton to be sold and to be converted into dolls’ 
clothes or furnishings for the dolls’ house. 
Sense Training. — In the same way that children 
playing grocery store are taught the sense-properties 
of foods through observing and feeling these foods, so 
in the use of textiles they learn the differences in 
appearance and texture by testing with eyes and 
hands. Reports of poor sense observations can be 
eliminated by new sense experiences. Gradually the 
eye can be trained to act for hand, or hand for eye. 
Training in the Three R’s. — The relation of the 
three R’s to store plays was discussed in connection 
with dramatizing a grocery store. In playing dry- 
goods store new systems of measuring, new combina- 
tions of figures, and new words have to be learned 
and practised, but the methodology of instruction 
through the spontaneous use of drill and memory work 
is the same. 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  92 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
Other Store-Plays 
As revealed in the records of spontaneous activities, 
children enjoy playing other types of store than 
grocery and clothing stores; millinery shops, drug 
stores, bakeries, five and ten cent stores, department 
stores, and hardware stores are among those which 
have the greatest appeal. Besides the educational 
possibilities already mentioned in connection with 
grocery and clothing stores, each type presents special 
opportunities. For example, in millinery shops chil- 
dren can learn something of color and of esthetic 
values in combinations, besides gaining a crude 
manipulative skill. In playing drug store some simple 
chemical laws can be taught through experimenting 
with simple dyes or acids and through observing the 
action of these on materials. In playing hardware 
store, something of the processes necessary to produce 
iron, steel, and other metals can be learned through 
excursions to foundries or to manufacturing plants. 
In supervising the dramatizing of department stores, 
the teacher can work for arrangement and classifica- 
tion of materials. It is true that such arrangement is 
on a strictly utilitarian basis, with little regard for| 
form, shape, or color; but use appeals to children, and 
much information can be picked up in these first 
efforts to classify on a commercial basis.

CHAPTER VI 
PLAYING SCHOOL 
é 
School-Plays Usually Depict Conflicts with Author- 
ity. — In their school-plays children dramatize all the 
new contacts the school environment affords; especi- 
ally is this true where unpleasant forms of discipline 
have attracted attention to contrasts in behavior. 
It seems to be a native tendency in most of us to 
recount the human woes that befall us in our adjust- 
ments to the demands of group life. Even when we 
become so well disciplined that we no longer expose 
our personal struggles and achievements to the cold 
glare of public opinion, we often delight in a purely 
imaginary airing of our wrongs, and also derive keen 
satisfaction from mentally rehearsing our triumphs. 
Children, on the contrary, are not yet disciplined to 
test experiences in this subjective way. Their ideas 
carry over almost immediately into overt action; 
pantomime and imitative-dramatic play afford them 
one means to test the meaning of their conflicts with 
society. And since a large number of their conflicts 
or adjustments come in school, where instincts and 
capacities are translated in social terms, it is but 
natural that school-plays should abound in examples 
of misdemeanors and mastering and submissive be- 
havior. Children derive a sense of satisfaction from 
dramatizing the rdles of so-called bad children even 
when they themselves have no tendencies actually to 
commit such misdemeanors. By so doing they gain 
93

   some sort of emotional satisfaction and some intel- 
lectual appraisement of facts. This tendency to 
contrast other lives with our own is not confined to 
childhood and youth; it persists throughout life, and 
seeks outlets through gossip or undue curiosity con- 
cerning the personal details of other persons’ lives, or, 
on a higher level, through fiction and the drama. 
What Constitutes the Appeal of School-Plays? — 
Playing school thus becomes a game in which reading, 
writing, and arithmetic are subsidiary features. The 
real point of the game is social interaction, in which 
we see various degrees of mastering and submissive 
behavior and display with its social results—either 
smiles and stares of approval or scowls and expres- 
sions of scorn and disapproval. Attention-getting 
and the display of oppositional force are among the 
keenest sources of satisfaction such plays afford, as 
the records fully testify. 
Favorite Roles. — Playing teacher is the favorite 
role because it affords the largest opportunity for' 
display and for such physical activities as distributing 
papers and writing on the board. Could teachers 
only be present to study their youthful imitators, 
they would smile at the tricks of gesture, tones of| 
voice, and methods of discipline so facilely displayed 
to groups of admiring pupils. 
The Three R’s.— In the records of spontaneou 
school-plays the three R’s are seen to come in fo 
their share of attention. Drawing and spelling lesson: 
become delightful pastimes while self-initiated moc 
examinations provoke much merriment. Surely thi 
is one example of play as a psychological attitude.

RECORDS OF SCHOOL-PLAYS 
1. School. Ormsby Park Playroom. — Four girls 
about eight years old seat theriselves at a long, low 
table facing a blackboard. A fifth girl is the teacher. 
The teacher rings a bell, then cleans the blackboard. 
Two children come in late. ‘You got to stay five 
minutes after school,’ says the teacher, pointing a 
ruler at the late comers. She gives each child a 
paper, then writes on the board, ‘‘Exsmination in 
Arithmetic.’’ With great hilarity the children set 
about working the problems. There are frequent 
interruptions as they poke each other, crawl under 
the table, or jump up and down in their chairs. Of 
course, they are sharply reproved by the teacher. 
After about five minutes, she collects the papers and 
stands facing the pupils. ‘‘One,’’ she says sternly; 
all the children sit up straight. ‘‘Two’’; all stand. 
“Three,” and the children face her. ‘‘Now we'll 
have our physical culture.’’ The children stiffen and 
appear attentive. ‘‘One, two, three, four,’ the teacher 
calls out, as she extends her arms sideward four times. 
Then she repeats the calls for movements downward 
and upward. ‘Pay attention!’’ she says to a child 
who forgets to do this. ‘‘Now we'll play ‘I Say’,” 
announces the teacher. The children relax. ‘I say 
hands up, hands down.” ‘There! I caught you.” 
The child caught comes forward and becomes the 
teacher. And so on through various movements the 
children follow different leaders with evident satis- 
faction. Then to the same counts, one, two, and three, 
he children turn, march, and sit down in their seats.

“Now we'll make something,” says the teacher. She 
gives each child a sheet of paper and colored crayon. 
Then, looking very important, she steps to the board 
and draws a tree, using quick, broad strokes. But the 
children are busy coloring their sheets of paper. 
Only when each child has succeeded in making a 
bright surface does he turn to the board and imitate 
the drawing of a tree. All this time a supervisor of 
writing stands anxiously outside, waiting her turn. 
At last she rebels at being kept waiting so long, stalks 
angrily into the school, and takes possession of the 
board. The teacher deliberately collects the papers. 
2. School, House, and Cowboy. Lawrence Park 
Playroom. — Some of the girls have houses; they are 
mothers working at home. Others are children 
going to school. At school they sing, draw, cut, and 
take physical exercises. When school is out they go 
home for dinner, which is prepared by their mothers. 
Soon the bell rings and they return to school. At 
recess they play games. The parents then come to 
visit the school and inquire how the children are 
doing. By and by the doctor comes and examines| 
each child. A group of boys are playing cowbo 
near by. They have stacked chairs to represen 
houses. These boys look with interest at the schoo 
play. Some of them gallop over to the school o 
imaginary horses and make the school children a visit.

CHAPTER VII 
HuntTineG Pays 
Hunting as Related to Food-getting. — Thorndike 
lists hunting among food-getting protective responses, 
and says: ‘‘The presence of this tendency in man’s 
nature under the conditions of civilized life gets him 
little food and much trouble. * *. * Teaching, 
bullying, cruelty are thus in part the results of one of 
nature’s means of providing self and family with food; 
and what grew up as a pillar of human self-support 
has become so extravagant a luxury as to be almost a ry     
                       
   
        
   
   vice. 
Persistence of the Hunting Response in Modern 
Life. — In speaking of the persistence of the hunting 
response, Thorndike says: “‘ For example, the readiness 
lof the hunting response persists even in spite of the 
inadequate stimuli and absence of rewards of a modern 
illage or town, so that, if habitual restraints are 
emoved, men will gladly leave their work to chase an 
scaped cat. They will, with slight encouragement, 
ndergo notable privations and expense to spend a few 
ays in tracking game and possessing themselves of 
nimal carcasses got by so near an approach as is 
ossible to man’s original naked-handed pursuit.’’? 
The Culture-epoch Theory Applied to Hunting 
lays. — Many teachers attempt to apply the culture-

98 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
epoch theory. They approach the formal subjects of 
the school through the epoch of culture in which 
children are supposedly living. For example, at a 
certain time children’s minds are filled by teachers 
with literary and institutional products of the hunting 
epoch. Likewise children are encouraged’ to make 
implements used in the hunt. Modern psychologists 
regard the effort to postulate more than a general cor- 
respondence between the development of the child 
and that of the race as unscientific procedure. They 
consider that children like stories of Hiawatha and 
other boys living in a hunting epoch only because the 
life described is simple and attractive. That children 
are as interested in the hunting exploits of modern 
soldiers was evidenced during the late war. Children 
like stories and games of any kind dealing with 
hunting, flight, and pursuit. It is.not necessary that 
the stories or experiences should exist as a part of 
racial inheritance to be attractive. 
Playful Manifestations of the Hunting Instinct. — 
Children’s play abounds in examples of spontaneous 
flight and pursuit. The baby pursues his mother 
with outstretched arms, and hides his face in her lap 
when he is captured and held. Children seldom lose 
an opportunity to chase small escaping creatures, 
birds or butterflies, field mice, or fleeing cats and 
timid dogs. Entirely apart from training, they sho 
a tendency to pounce upon and grasp these resistin 
creatures, exhibiting annoyance if they lose a catc 
and hence fail to investigate the nature of the escapin 
object. Some children are not satisfied to examin 
their prey, but torment and tease until disciplined fo:

cruelty. In rural communities with what patience 
the young archer perfects his shot and _ tirelessly 
pursues his game, bringing down birds and small 
nimals with his missiles! Children seldom care for 
he birds’ eggs they plunder, the fish they strive so 
ard to catch, the bettles and bugs they collect and 
ometimes dismember. They do, however, show a 
endency to exhibit their treasures to some approving 
erson. When the hunting responses are called 
orth by human beings we have the pursuit, capture, 
nd holding of the victim, with either teasing and 
ullying as the result, or fighting if the one pursued

children’s games after the age of six, there is either the

Many Hide-and-Seek Games Involve the Hunting 
Responses.—It remains to discuss the part played by 
the hunting instinct in more formal games involving 
chase, flight, and hiding. Hide and seek is played 
by children the world over. The playful infant hides 
his face against his mother’s arm in order to get a 
sense of alienation and return, and children play 
hide and seek games in rural communities or in 
crowded city streets. In many chasing games such 
as in Fox Chasing and in Hare and Hounds, 
certain handicaps placed upon the chasers protect 
the fugitive and give point to the game. Com- 
plexity is added to certain games by the invention 
of safety zones; that is, the pursued is safe when 
touching wood or a goal, by squatting, or the like.

  102 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
Organized ball games partake of the nature of the 
hunt in that there is attempted mastery over an 
escaping object. Baseball, football, and cricket can be 
utilized to afford social situations in which the hunting 
responses are trained and organized for social group 
purposes. These games are sometimes classed as 
hunting plays, although they show more of the 
characteristics of fighting plays. A wide range of 
children’s games involves hunting for hidden ob- 
jects; such games are Button, Button and Hide the 
Thimble. A large number represent a chase for the 
possession of a vacant chair or a vacant place in the 
ring; such games are Going to Jerusalem, Stage 
Coach, and Flower Basket. 
The Educational Significance of Hunting Plays. — 
This collection of spontaneous plays contains a goodly 
proportion of hunting plays. Hunting plays are 
found in the repertoire of children’s play the world 
over because the hunting responses are ingrained in 
original nature. Hunting plays persist throughout 
childhood and the pre-adolescent period because they 
function in the organization of impulses, instincts, 
and habits. They provide an outlet for vigorous 
activity and give opportunities for the gregarious 
tendencies, for mastering behavior, for codperation, 
ingenuity, strategy, and leadership. It depends upon 
supervision whether these plays degenerate into teasing 
and bullying contests in which oppression of the weak 
and defiance of law and order become the rules of the 
game, or whether kindness, a sense of justice, and fair 
play are evolved as means of control. Under wise 
supervision, such as the Boy Scouts’ and Campfire
-P-A-G-E-115
HUNTING PLAYS 103 
Girls’ organizations afford, we see the normal use of 
the hunting instinct. The records of these organiza- 
tions show that our American youths are as willing to 
undertake difficult and hazardous undertakings for 
the benefit of society as to play bandits and robbers. 
The Hunting Type of Mind in Relation to the 
Drama.— The following quotation shows the possible 
relation of the hunting type of mind to art. ‘‘The 
interest of the game, the alternate suspense and move- 
ment, the strained and alert attention to stimuli, 
always changing, always demanding graceful, prompt, 
strategic, and forceful response; the play of emotions 
along the scale of want, effort, success, or failure — 
this is the very type, psychologically speaking, of the 
drama. The breathless interest with which we hang 
upon the movements of play or novel are reflexes of 
the mental attitudes evoked in the hunting vocation.’’ 
Cowboy and Indian Plays Involve Hunting Re- 
sponses. — Both Indian and cowboy plays include 
hunting responses. The dramatization of Indians 
appeals to children chiefly because of the human inter- 
est their lives and characters afford. Indians rep-— 
resent vigorous, active types of persons who react to 
environment on a level the child can understand. A 
child of six years likes to imitate Indian children riding 
their ponies and learning to shoot with crude bows and 
arrows. He enjoys building imaginary fires, cooking 
food, and caring for the Indian papooses. Gradually 
his interest shifts to more adventurous sports and 
activities. With children from seven to nine or ten

years of age hunting becomes a game involving compe- 
tition in play marksmanship. The child imitates 
Indians pursuing and capturing wild animals. About 
the same age interest in construction is high; building 
wigwams, laying campfires, and making crude suits 
out of paper or cloth are keenly enjoyed. As soon as 
the historical interest begins to develop children 
like to read stories of Indian wars and often spend 
hours at a time dramatizing the thrilling tales of 
adventure found in both history and fiction. 
Cowboy Plays. — The cowboy interest is less vital, 
but still runs high with boys from six to nine years. 
The preference for stories of frontier life and for 
moving-picture shows depicting thrilling adventures 
of cowboys testifies to this interest. The manufacture 
and’ sale of cowboy suits for children has become a 
profitable industry. The cowboy appeals chiefly to
-P-A-G-E-117

the growing boy because the boy loves adventure and 
because cowboy stories tell of things that are difficult 
and dangerous to do. 
ReEcorDS OF HUNTING PLAYS 
1. White Men and Indians. Washington Park. — 
The children play they are white men hunting in an 
Indian forest. An Indian brave sees them and reports 
the news to the chief, who summons all his braves. 
After much gesturing the braves mount their horses 
and gallop off in wild pursuit of the intruders, captur- 
ing all the white men. The Indians then dance 
around their captives, exhibiting in their dance the 
movements of the hunt. 
This dance was most interesting because constructed from spon- 
taneous movements interpreting the children’s own conception of 
the hunt. Of course, Indian pictures and music were supplied as an 
incentive. 
2. Little Red Feather. Lawrence Park. — An 
Indian camp is constructed. The children select 
braves and squaws to live in the camp. A small 
child is named Little Red Feather after a hero in a 
story. The braves tell Little Red Feather to ride 
off to the woods on his pony; then they depart for the 
hunt. When they return from the hunt and sit down 
to a meal prepared by the squaws, they discover that 
Little Red Feather is not among them. The braves 
jump up and ride away on their horses. The search 
proves vain and the braves ride back to camp, shaking 
their heads at the anxious squaws, who stand outside 
the wigwams shading their eyes as they gaze far off in 
the distance. The chief then points to the cowboy  
-P-A-G-E-118
    
106 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
ranch. All the braves ride off in that direction. On 
the way they meet and capture a group of cowboys; 
not finding Little Red Feather with these cowboys, 
they release the cowboys and ask their aid in the 
search. All ride off in different directions. At 
last little Red Feather, fast asleep under a tree, is 
found by one of the cowboys and is brought back to 
the Indian camp. With loud shouts the Indians place 
Little Red Feather in their midst. Both the cow- 
boys and the Indian braves dance merrily around 
him while the squaws hop up and down near by, 
grunting their satisfaction as they dance. 
In plays of this type note the enjoyment of flight and pursuit, of 
imitation of the outward symbols of Indian dress and life, of manipu- 
lative activities, and, most of all, of large, free, unrestricted move- 
ment. 
A Pilgrim Thanksgiving. Lawrence Park. — About 
Thanksgiving time when the play leader told stories 
about the Indians she found that the children associ- 
ated Indians chiefly with cowboys. Gradually, how- 
ever, as the result of listening to stories, the children 
began to take interest in historic events and to 
dramatize scenes connected with these events. One 
day they made Indian caps; later the interest in 
Pilgrims led to the making of Quaker caps. Both 
Pilgrims and Indians hunted and cooked food. 
Girls and boys played these réles; some were Indian 
squaws, others Indian braves, and still others were 
Pilgrims — men, women, and children. One day a 
Pilgrim went to an Indian’s tent. The Indian gave 
him food while all the braves danced their hunting
-P-A-G-E-119
HUNTING PLAYS 107 
dance. Each day something new was added to the 
play until the following plot grew up: 
Event I. Indian camp. Braves and squaws are 
seated around the fire; the squaws are making baskets; 
the braves are smoking pipes; the Indian chief walks 
up and down. 
Event II. Pilgrim home. Mother and children sit 
down to a table but find no food. 
Event III. Indian camp. The chief drops his ear 
to the ground. He hears the sound of deer and 
makes a sign to his braves, who jump up and down for 
joy. All get bows and arrows and run to the woods. 
Soon they return, place the captured deer on the 
ground, and perform a dance around it to show their 
satisfaction. After this ceremony, the squaws cook 
the deer and partake of the meat. One of the braves 
steals away to the Pilgrims’ home, carrying some corn 
he hopes to trade for trinkets. When he finds the 
Pilgrims have nothing to eat he goes back and tells 
his chief. All the braves go over with the remains of 
their deer. The Pilgrims rejoice and invite their 
neighbors in for a feast. 
Event IV. Pilgrim home. The Indians come over 
with corn and show the Pilgrims how to plant. . The 
little children work with their mothers and fathers. 
4. Robinson Crusoe: A Play of Adventure. Law- 
rence Park Playroom.— In the playroom hung a 
picture of Robinson Crusoe and his man Friday. One 
seven-year-old boy noticed the picture and began to 
talk about it. It seemed he had heard the story at 
school. This boy said to his companion, ‘‘ You be 
Friday, and I’ll be Robinson Crusoe.” Then, to
-P-A-G-E-120
  
108 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
himself, ‘First, I’ll need a boat.’”’ He thought a 
while, then turned a table upside down to represent 
the boat and found two brooms for oars. He dis- 
covered he could make the boat rock by pushing his 
feet against the table legs. After a while he jumped 
on to a raft (a large piece of cardboard) and floated to 
the shore. Here he built a fire (selecting a gas grate 
for the fire) and put up a cloth tent. Soon he found 
footprints and followed the imaginary tracks carefully 
until he discovered Friday, whom he brought back to 
the tent. Both went fishing and shooting. They 
brought home fish and wild animals; they skinned the 
animals and cooked the food. 
This play lasted four days. Both boys loved adventure. 
Robinson Crusoe was the same child who played he was George 
Washington cutting down the cherry tree, in one of the house-plays 
previously recorded. The author includes this play under Cowboy 
and Indian Plays because it appeals to the love of adventure and 
involves chasing and hunting activities. 
5. House and Robbers. Andrews School. — One 
rainy day the children were playing in the hall. Four 
girls had built houses, outlining rooms with blocks. 
The houses contained porches and rooms of various 
sizes; in one a telephone was installed. The dolls 
living in these houses visited each other and went to 
market. A group of boys began to tease the girls and 
annoyed them so much that the girls’ play was broken 
up. The boys were dramatizing burglars. One boy 
said he was a policeman; the other boys said they were 
the burglars, and would give the policeman a chase. 
The girls, seeing their chances for house play thwarted, 
now entered into the boys’ play. It was supposed to
-P-A-G-E-121
HUNTING PLAYS 109 
be night; some of the girls went to bed; others started 
away for a visit, but came home unexpectedly in 
order to chase the robbers. Sometimes they caught 
the robbers, sometimes not. They always telephoned 
the police, who usually caught the robbers and took 
them to court. One boy acted as the judge and 
decided what to do with the prisoners. 
Is not this an example of how teasing often originates in boys’ 
love of adventure? The boys teased the girls because there was 
nothing else for them to do; it was raining and all the children were 
crowded into a narrow space in the main hall of the schoolhouse. 
The instant a boy suggested dramatizing a policeman the idea of 
robbers sprang up. This play appealed because it gave them a 
game of chance and hazard, involving chasing, hiding, and catching, 
with a dramatic courthouse scene at the close. Observe how easy 
it was for the play leader to turn this love of adventure into a 
better channel in the Boston Tea Party play, which is next de- 
scribed. 
The Boston Tea Party. Andrews School Play- 
ground. — The same boys who had been robbers and 
policemen began to build forts out of some blocks left 
by the girls. The play leader suggested that the 
group dramatize the Boston Tea Party. Most of 
the boys seemed to know the story fairly well. Find- 
ing a large box for a boat, they rowed it over to the 
American fort. The captain of the British boat, 
accompanied by soldiers, came to the American fort 
with a written message telling about the tax on tea. 
The Americans tore up this note. The British re- 
turned to their boat. That night the Americans held 
a meeting; they dressed up as Indians and while the 
British slept they dumped the tea overboard. When 
the British found out that the tea had been thrown 
   
-P-A-G-E-122

out, they started a battle. The Americans won and 
had a parade. 
Both House and Robbers and the Boston Tea Party belong to 
the type of plays included under Cowboys and Indians; they appeal 
to love of adventure.

CHAPTER VIII 
FIGHTING PLays 
The Fighting Instinct. — During the World War 
much was said and written concerning the fighting 
instinct; current educational beliefs were assailed by 
contending theorists and a clearer formulation of some 
of the psychological aspects of the fighting instinct 
was the result. Several of these viewpoints will be 
touched upon in our discussion of the individual and 
group aspects of pugnaciousness. The fighting in- 
stinct is a secondary instinct in that it presupposes the 
presence of other instincts. McDougall assumes that 
the general tendency to angry behavior of some sort 
at the persistent thwarting of any instinctive response 
is an original tendency; in the main Kirkpatrick and 
Thorndike also agree with this view. Many instincts, 
very different in character, if thwarted in their natural 
expression give rise to the fighting responses. Thus 
we see babies push and scream when held tightly 
because the instinct for physical activity is thwarted; 
children giving rein to the hunting instinct, chasing a 
dog or a fleeing comrade, show irritation and exhibit 
fighting movements if checked in the course of their 
chase; boys or girls interested in collecting chafe if 
their treasures are despoiled, while the thwarting of 
other instincts, such as self-display, mastery, and sex, 
also leads to fighting responses. 
Discarded is the viewpoint which considers fighting 
as a single instinct, aroused and called into action by 
fairly definite and well recognized situations. Experi- 
mr
-P-A-G-E-124
  112 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
mental studies of the fighting instinct have shown it 
to consist of a large number of specific responses 
involving personal encounter in the form of scuffling, 
crowding, pushing, wrestling, and the like, accom- 
panied by temper and anger. Fighting plays are 
thus seen to be difficult to analyze on account of their 
complexity and the variety of situations in which they 
occur. 
The Evolution of Pugnacious Behavior. — Before a 
child has passed the first year most parents have 
observed signs of the fighting instinct. In tracing 
the appearances and development of the fighting re- 
sponses we notice, if we observe carefully, that children 
of three years do not fight with their playmates or 
exhibit fighting movements when in opposition to 
adults from the sheer joy of the combat, but because 
some instinctive activity is thwarted, or because they 
need to redress an injury. From the third year 
onward there is rapid growth in the tendency to com- 
bat anyone who occasions discomfort, or thwarts 
cherished rights and wishes. A mother often meets 
resistance when she attempts to put a child to bed; 
likewise her efforts to withdraw objects which incite 
her child’s curiosity sometimes occasion fits of temper 
or fighting. Ifa boy is hit by another boy he instantly 
hits back, unless the motor response is inhibited by 
fear or will power. Until approaching adolescence 
he prefers to settle difficulties in a direct physical way. 
Might is right until a new code of settling disputes is| 
agreed upon by the group. 
Toleration and Justice Originate in Force. 
Adults show a regrettable lack of understanding o'

   FIGHTING PLAYS 113 
children’s combative behavior from the first immediate 
physical responses of this kind to the later reasoned 
intellectual and moral acts which take permanent root 
in habit and character. Usually both boys and girls 
are forbidden to fight, and are severely punished if 
they do so. But the instinct is so strong that many 
boys and girls either fight without thinking of conse- 
quences or 'ook the punishment full in the face and 
fight anyhow. Punishment seldom eradicates the 
tendency to fight, except in the cases where children 
ave weak wills and can easily be coerced. Parents 
eem to loose sight of the fact that toleration and 
ustice originate in force, and have a permanent basis 
n force, not in moral feeling or in the conscious 
alculation of what is best from the standpoint of 
xpediency. 
The Sociological Significance of Combativeness. — 
icDougall says: ‘“‘The instinct of pugnacity has 
layed a part second to none in the evolution of social 
rganization, and in the present age it operates more 
owerfully than any other in producing demonstrations 
f collective emotions and action on a great scale.””! 
prominent authority on the psychology of childhood 
ys: ‘‘The trouble with parents and teachers often is 
at they want to omit the first crude stage of the 
ndency and come at once to its higher levels; but on 
gical grounds alone it is hard to see how, if a boy 
las been required to inhibit such pugnacious ten- 
lencies on the physical level, he can later on fight for 
untry or friends or principles. He has not known 
hat it means, when thwarted, to stand for his wishes 
1W. McDougall: Social Psychology, p. 279.
-P-A-G-E-126
  114 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
and rights; he has not known the sweets of success} 
or the shame of defeat; he has not known what it 
means to suffer for the sake of gaining something tha’ 
seems worth while. The door has been shut on al 
this opportunity when first the instinct was strong 
how then can we expect him later on to fight hi 
difficulties, take his stand for the right, to suffer for i 
if need be?” ! 
Ellwood says that the view is erroneous which hold 
that the instinct of pugnacity in man must have bee 
stronger in primitive life than now, and adds: “‘It i 
not improbable, therefore, that in the whole course 0 
human evolution the fighting instinct has greatl 
increased in strength.’’ He gives the following sug: 
gestions in regard to the scope and use of the fightin 
instinct: ‘‘Whether or not the fighting instinc 
needs to be exercised against human beings in orde 
to maintain it at normal strength is an open question] 
There seems to be but little danger of the fightin 
instinct in any race dying out, and the more reasonabl 
view is that its legitimate exercise in civilized societ 
is in combating the moral and social evils whic 
prevent humanity from realizing its ideals, rather tha 
in actual physical conflict between individuals an 
groups of individuals.’’» McDougall stresses th| 
part pugnacity has played in the evolution of socii 
organization. He emphasizes the use of collecti

combat in communities and the more refined forms of 
combat within communities.! : 
George E. Johnson believes in organized training 
for combative activities. ‘‘What this pugnacity 
needs now,” he says, ‘‘is to be directed, to be enlight- 
ened, to be tempered with the will to endure so that 
consecrated to some ideal it will know no yielding 
power while life remains.’ 
Should Girls Engage in Fighting Plays? — Although 
the fighting instinct is stronger in boys than in girls, 
it is present in both sexes and needs exercise. If this 
instinct has proved as valuable in race development 
as some sociologists would have us believe, it seems a 
lamentable lack of foresight to leave our girls out of 
alculation in planning for training the combative 
instinct. There is no reason why women should be 
tient and long-suffering in the face of opposition, 
hy they should train themselves to be subordinate 
n matters other than those demanded for group 
elfare. One psychologist throws out the query: 
‘Is it possible women would not be so open to the 
riticism of being ‘lacking in honor,’ of ‘not under- 
tanding fair play,’ or of being sneaky and under- 
anded if this tendency had received proper treatment

2 116 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
accomplished what the writer had in mind, it has 
pointed toward the conclusion that the fighting 
responses are so intimate a part of our original) 
equipment that it is impossible to eradicate them. 
Substitution is the only course. This does not mean, 
however, that we commit ourselves to the viewpoint 
heard so often in connection with criticism of the 
League of Nations, namely, that fighting is so deeply 
implanted in original nature that we can never settle 
disputes by arbitration. Even the biologist admits 
the fact that human nature can be changed to a certain 
extent. That is, situations can be so altered that 
original tendencies to action have no chance to 
function harmfully. 
A practical consideration of educational procedur 
in working with combative behavior would be some 
what as follows: 
On the physical plane we should endeavor to avoi 
as far as possible situations which bring undesirabl 
fighting responses. Likewise we should refuse t 
eliminate situations in which fighting can be used t 
teach fair play, protection of others’ rights, and th 
substitution of unselfish aims for personal gain 
We should eliminate the bullying and teasing of thos 
who are unable to resist. Where teasing is betwee 
equals it has some value in that it develops resource 
fulness and enables the child teased to set up barrier} 
of defense. All plays involving personal encounte 
should proceed according to rules, but so far as i 
possible, the children or the group involved should fe: 
the necessity and urgency of the rules. Self-contr 
and inhibition should be demanded and enforced.

   On the intellectual plane we must recognize the 
value of oppositional force. The impulse to opposi- 
tion should not be regarded as an undesirable quality 
or disposition of mind. It is a valuable asset in 
modern life. Rivalry or opposition in connection 
with the imitative impulse is the very leaven of life. 
The child who opposes the existing order of things 
may have something to contribute. At least the 
teacher and children should consider his suggestion, 
be it an appeal for new rules to a game or an effort to 
champion some desire of the gang. If the opposition 
is unreasonable and the child needs to be swung back 
into line, strong social pressure can be brought by the 
group to induce coéperation even where intellectual 
opposition exists. It is only thus that the rights of 
the majority can be protected. 
Training in Combativeness Through Debates. — 
In connection with school work many situations occur 
which permit training in intellectual combativeness. 
Intellectual opposition can thrive only in a situation 
of social freedom. Children should feel free to 
express differences of opinion; they should also be 
trained to respect other children’s views. Just as 
they must learn what is fair in a fight by fighting, 
they must learn how to argue by arguing. They 
acquire these moral values not by precepts or ad- 
monitions but by practice in intellectual combative- 
ness. Teachers need to learn the laws governing 
intellectual combativeness as well as the rules govern- 
ing sports and games. 
Through Sports and Games. — It is a well-known 
‘act that a better physical development results from  
-P-A-G-E-130
     
                
   
         
   
       
   
             118 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
playing foot-ball and base-ball, from swimming, 
dancing, and track games than can be gained through 
formal gymnastics. This is not only because the 
recreational advantages are superior in group games 
and sports, but also because the situations affording 
combativeness in strength, speed, and daring are life 
situations in which the training that is gained is of 
the practical sort. The writer has selected eight well- 
known games for the purpose of analyzing the social 
situations such games afford for the training of com- 
bativeness. 
1. Cat and Mouse. —In this game, children with 
clasped hands wrestle in circle form to assist the 
passage of a child called ‘‘mouse’’ and hinder the 
chase of the one impersonating a cat. The dodging 
and wrestling movements are valuable for muscular 
development, and the group contest affords training in 
unanimity of purpose. 
2. Circle Ball, a game popular with both boys and 
girls, is also played in circle form with a child in the 
center endeavoring to intercept the passage of a 
basket ball tossed from one member of the outside 
circle to another. Here fighting is involved in 
reaching and jumping movements. 
3. In Dodge Ball half of the players stand in a 
circle attempting to hit with a basket ball the other 
half inside the circle. Those in the center seek to 
avoid the ball by dodging and jumping. 
4. Straddle Ball is another game in which protec- 
tive movements of the feet are required. The children 
stand in a circle astride and touching each others’ 
feet. One child in the center of the circle tries t
-P-A-G-E-131
  FIGHTING PLAYS 119 
throw the basket ball between the feet of some child or 
between two players’ feet. 
5. Pass Ball.— A game in which children in two 
concentric circles facing each other strive to pass balls 
around so rapidly to members of their own circle that 
they can overtake the balls moving in the opposite 
circle. In this game we see the development of rapid 
movements, and devotion to the group’s interests. 
6. Bombardment. — In this game two teams line 
up on opposing sides from fifteen to twenty-five feet 
back of the line on their own territory. Each player 
guards an Indian club which stands on the floor 
beside him. If this club is knocked down by one of 
the balls of the opponents, several of whom play at 
the same time, the player whose club is hit must 
replace the club before returning the ball. Points are 
scored by opposite sides when a club is hit or accident- 
ally falls. In this team game we see fighting for 
points which are scored not as individual gains but for 
the group. 
7. Human Target. — One child as a Human Target 
tries to avoid being hit by a basket ball which others 
re passing among themselves and throwing at him. 
ere we see individual fighting movements in the 
orm of jumping and dodging. 
8. Kick Ball. —In this game we see fighting by 
eans of kicking movements. Both sides line up in 
itting position four feet apart and fight to score points 
yy kicking the ball over the heads of opponents. The 
icking must be done with the feet while both hands 
re placed on the floor.

  120 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
Through Manual Projects.—To train in com- 
bativeness by manual work, one must study the skills 
prevalent at different ages, and learn to understand 
the use of these skills for personal emulation as well 
as for group advantage. In the kindergarten there is 
less interest in competing for manual skill than in the 
grades following. Still the desire to build the best 
house, paint the best furniture, weave the prettiest 
rug, etc., can be utilized. Even in the kindergarten, 
children can learn the fair way to excel and can be 
taught to share with the group some of the results of 
individual gain. Through the primary grades, skill 
is acquired more and more through competing with 
others. School gardens, school fairs, spelling bees, and 
grammatical contests can be so socialized that the 
group always shares a little in the personal advantage 
of some of its members. Children cannot learn too 
early that all do not start even in the race for honors 
and that the rules of fair play demand sharing with 
the group. 
RECORDS OF FIGHTING PLAYS 
1. Soldiers. Lawrence Park.— Seven soldiers 
march away, waving flags to the beat of a drum; 
behind them trails an express wagon containing a 
load of brooms to be used for guns. Some little girls 
playing house step out and wave good-bye to the 
soldiers. The soldiers hold a hurried consultation 
and decide upon a place for their camp. Two boys 
bring a screen to the spot selected and, using it for 
sides, erect a tent. Then they build a fire and get 
ready for bed. The play leader suggests the need of a

sentinel. A seven-year-old boy volunteers to play 
the part. He walks up and down, swinging a club 
as he walks. A new child stands near watching the 
play. ‘‘What are you doing around here?’ asks the 
sentinel shaking his stick at the new child. (The play 
leader makes a movement as if to interrupt but 
checks it and stands thinking.) Then the sentinel 
goes into a girls’ playhouse near by and threatens the 
children there. Morning comes and the watchman 
blows his bugle. All the soldiers scramble to their 
feet, wash their faces, and grab their guns. Following 
a boy who seems to have some plan of action, the 
children leave their camp and dash madly into the 
adjoining locker room. ‘‘Here they are!”’ shouts the 
leader, as he shakes the locker doors. ‘‘Break in!”
-P-A-G-E-134
  
122 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
All rattle the doors. One boy lies down and points a 
broom at an imaginary. enemy, while the others shout 
“Bang! Bang!’’ as they shake the doors. ‘‘All 
killed!’’ says the leader, whereupon the other children 
seem satisfied and run back to the camp. They 
take up the tent and go back to the house where the 
girls live. All eat an imaginary dinner. 
The children dramatizing this play were six or seven years old. 
The elements in the plot are so characteristic that they alone reveal 
to careful observers the psychological ages of the children. What 
interested the children primarily was movement and simple imita- 
tive-dramatic play — shooting, building a camp, and imitating overt 
acts of soldiers. Shooting occurs first because it is the most striking 
thing soldiers do. The children had evidently seen pictures of 
camps, for they knew how to dramatize the simple essentials of 
camp life. In all the dramatization we see that activity is pleasur- 
able as an end in itself, while noise as the result of activity gives 
spontaneous pleasure. Rattling doors and shouting “Bang! Bang!” 
are a source of original satisfaction. While the fighting and hunting 
responses are used, and the instinct of habitation is noticeable, the 
dramatic responses are the center and core of the game. Another 
point of interest in the analysis of this play is the threatening 
attitude displayed on the part of the sentinel. It is quite evident 
that a surly policeman was his copy. The fact that he had never 
been to the playroom before accounts for the play leader’s non- 
interference on the first day. 
2. A Soldier Camp. Andrews School Play- 
ground. — The children became so much interested 
in soldier plays that they wanted a tent. They 
planned how one could be made and selected three 
stakes. The play leader provided some unbleached 
muslin; this the children attached to an upright pole 
and fastened down with stakes. Then they put a 
flag on top of the tent and stacked some brooms out-

   side for guns. The girls put up a clothesline and hung: 
some washing on it. Outside the tent they built a 
fire, making a tripod with sand shovels and hanging a 
pail on it. Then they set the table, using twigs for 
knives, forks, and spoons, and sand molds for dishes. 
The boys formed a company, selected their captain, 
and drilled. The girls prepared the meals and served 
the soldiers. 
This play was repeated intermittently for several weeks, and 
shows the type of dramatic fighting play characteristic of children 
from seven to nine years old. While a child of kindergarten age 
plays soldier largely for the joy involved in the overt activity, such 
s the beating of drums, the waving of flags, and the gay tramping 
arch, children in the first primary grades need to construct more 
aried plots. There must be something for soldiers to do besides 
shoot and march, somewhere for them to go, other soldiers to 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
  124 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
fight, and a camp equipped for outdoor life. On this account 
formal games such as “Soldier Boy, Soldier Boy, Where Are You 
Going?” which appeal to kindergarten children because of the 
activity involved, fail to interest older children. They need to 
build plots full of details and variety. Play 2 is an illustration of 
spontaneously constructed plays of this sort. 
One other fact deserves mention. Note the réles played by the 
girls. I think their lack of active participation in the réles of 
soldiers is accounted for by the fact that the boys naturally took it 
for ‘granted girls couldn’t be soldiers, rather than that the girls 
preferred minor réles. Environment has had a great influence in 
depriving girls of legitimate play experiences. 
3. War. Washington Park Playground. — For a 
period of several years the author observed the spon- 
taneous play of a particular group of boys of many 
nationalities. These boys were between seven and 
ten years of age, full of life, and with a strong ten- 
dency to combat. There were days when they would 
display a restlessness and combativeness toward other 
children that made it hazardous for other children to 
play peacefully near by. This group of boys would 
rove about the playroom annoying other children and 
seeking a destructive outlet for their activities. One 
day when the restlessness was worse than usual, the 
play leader suggested that the boys choose sides for a 
battle. This was done with great alacrity, natural 
leaders springing up on both sides. One leader said 
his side was British; the other shouted, ‘‘We’re 
Americans.”” The Americans built a fort by bracing a 
gymnasium mattress against a swing frame; the British 
camped in the open just opposite. The captains 
of both sides drilled their men, but then seemed at a 
loss what to do. At last the American commander
-P-A-G-E-137
      FIGHTING PLAYS 125 
said, “‘Let’s fight!’ ‘‘What will you fight for?” 
asked the play leader. He looked puzzled for a while, 
then replied, ‘‘They’ve stole some of our land and we 
want the money.”’ The play leader thought a minute. 
She saw the plot was on a low level, yet determined 
to use it to get material out of which to develop a 
better plot. “All right!’ she answered. ‘‘Hadn’t 
you better go over there and ask them for the money, 
so they will know what they are fighting for?’’ The 
American commander went over and made his demand, 
which was refused by the British. It was plain that 
both sides wanted war. Again both sides lined up 
their men, the British standing behind a row of 
chairs. ‘Forward, march!”’ said the American com- 
mander. The soldiers shouldered brooms and marched 
several times around the room to the beat of the 
drum. When the third round was made a spon- 
taneous battle took place in which both sides rushed 
pell mell at each other, shouting ‘‘ Bang! Bang!’’ and 
pushing each other down in great confusion. This 
lasted only a minute or two and soon the play leader 
heard shouts of, ‘‘I pushed him down and he won’t 
stay there!’”’ or ‘“‘Never touched me!’’ Then the 
boys turned to her as the final court of appeal. She 
helped to eliminate the unfair pushing by suggesting 
that every man fall as soon as the broom touched him. 
She also helped to reconstruct the plot, and two or 
three days later substftuted an historic plot. An 
interesting result was that these unmanageable boys 
earned to utilize the combative instinct for group 
urposes. The pushing, crowding, and wrestling 
ovements were not eliminated, but were governed 
       
                         
-P-A-G-E-138
  126 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
by rules. Some direct fighting was permitted, but it 
was carefully supervised, and the children themselves 
were trained to judge and to act as umpires. The 
result was that other children played unmolested 
near by. For a period of several months the boys 
continued to develop interest and good habits through 
the use of fighting plays. 
The first thought occurring to one in examining this record is the 
low type of intelligence which prevailed in the boys’ social adjust- 
ments. One would be interested to know as a result of tests whether 
this was the result of poor native ability or of the immigrants’ 
condition of life in a crowded city. To the writer the play leader’s 
suggestion that the children invent an end to fight for was unneces- 
sary. The direct output of energy was the children’s immediate 
interest; the imposition of an end by the teacher was premature. 
Later plots constructed by the children after conscious deliberation, 
showed a commendable growth in the group’s conception of fair 
play, in loyalty to group ends, and in a willingness to refrain from 
unfair advantage. 
4. Soldiers and Indians. Washington Park Play- 
ground. — The boys chose sides— Americans and 
Indians. The Americans had their fort behind a 
bench on one side of the room; the Indians camped 
on the other side. The American captain drilled and 
marched his troops. The Indian chief led a war 
dance, then crouched down, put his hand to his fore- 
head, and searched for the enemy. When he saw the 
enemy he gave a loud war-whoop. All the braves 
rallied to him and crept stealthily toward the American} 
camp. When near, the Indians fired imaginary guns, 
shouting ‘“‘Bang! Bang!’’ The fighting became s 
rough that the play was stopped by the play leader 
This is an example of the need of constructive suggestion to con: 
vert the play into right channels of expression. 
 
-P-A-G-E-139

5. Indians and Cowboys. Arsenal Park. — One 
day after school, two boys, one in a cowboy suit and 
another in an Indian suit, came into the playroom. 
Both boys strolled listlessly around the room, their 
eyes resting nowhere for more than a moment. 
Plainly there was nothing in sight which appealed to 
them. At length the Indian said, “Let’s get guns!” 
Both boys seized toy brooms and started to shoot 
with them. The cowboy called another boy to him 
and the two hovered near a screened gas fire, pointing 
the guns toward the blaze and shouting ‘Bang! 
Bang!’’ The Indian found another boy to play with 
and crouched behind a table. Soon the Indians 
attacked the cowboys. When asked by the play 
leader why they were fighting, the Indian chief said, 
“For a horse.’’ Then he added, ‘‘ You be our horse.” 
The play leader consented. The Indians tied her to a 
table. Soon the cowboys came over to get the horse 
and in the ensuing battle the play became rough. 
The play leader took away the brooms and stopped 
the game. The Indian said, ‘“Let’s go home; she 
won't let us have the guns!’’ Then he drew off the 
cowboy and both sulked for a while. The play leader 
rallied the other children and together they played 
cowboy. But the play lacked vitality. It did ac- 
complish a purpose, however; it showed the boys the 
necessity of fair play. They watched furtively and 
with interest. Finally the Indian and cowboy played 
chase, hiding behind chairs and sliding down the slide. 
Again we see a play on a very low social and intellectual plane. 
It is included as an illustration of the part the fighting instinct plays 
in causing restlessness. Evidently these boys appeared in the
-P-A-G-E-140
  128 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
playroom after a day in school in which many normal instincts 
toward activity had been thwarted. Many children are unfairly 
blamed for fighting on their way home from school. This fighting 
is sometimes a natural reaction from a day of repression. A study 
of fighting responses shows how naturally they appear when other 
instincts are refused normal functioning. Unfortunately the 
playground cannot handle such cases alone. Until the school, 
also, learns to handle the instincts properly, much of the play- 
ground training is only palliative. 
6. Battles of the French and Indian War. Mt. 
Washington Playground.' 
a. Braddock’s Defeat.—‘‘Indians under Big Chief 
Pratt hide behind trees. English, all armed with 
brooms, parade out in stiff military fashion, and 
stubbornly maintain their ground, while the firing, 
which begins immediately, goes on. Almost all of the 
English fall to the ground, either dead or wounded. 
Two soldiers half carry, half drag the dying com- 
mander from the scene of battle. In the barracks 
the general revives and then the roll call is taken. A 
volunteer consents to go out immediately to spy on 
the enemy, which is still in the vicinity. A cry of fire 
is raised at this instant. Great confusion. One group 
fights the fire; the other group attacks the Indians and 
the French who have committed the outrage. More 
killing; some captures. (All the soldiers and the Indians 
in the play have nine lives.) A lull in hostilities ensue: 
while efforts are made to arrange for a peaceful council. 
English messenger is attacked in Indian camp and hi: 
scalp (a piece of swamp grass on a stick) thrown int 
British camp. Fighting is renewed with increase 
intensity. British have now learned the India

method of fighting and use the same. Fighting 
continues until both sides are exhausted. 
b. Fall of Quebec. — A lumber pile represents the 
Heights and its surface the Plains of Abraham. 
French and Indians lie sleeping on the Plains. Sen- 
tinel, on guard, walks back and forth. (Indians in 
this game use guns.) British creep up under cover of 
darkness in the snow, through the trackless forests. 
Guard is surprised and killed. The Heights are 
scaled and the fight commences. The battle, which 
lasts a long time, is followed by negotiations of 
interesting character.” 
This play, though historically inaccurate in some details, repre- 
sents an interesting combination of the dramatic and combative 
instincts. Miss Lewis states in her notes that the boy who played 
the part of commander-in-chief had been one of the hardest on the 
playground to manage; that after the fighting games began he 
became a helper instead of a menace to the group. 
7. A Snow Battle. Washington Park. — A heavy 
snow brought to the boys’ minds the idea of having a 
snow fight. All hastened to put on caps and coats 
nd ran quickly out-of-doors to the spot where the 
now was deepest. A fort was speedily built; sides 
ere chosen and arrayed against each other; then the 
attle was begun amidst wild shouts of glee. Vigorous 
and-to-hand conflict resulted in clouds of flying snow. 
t was soon evident that the demolished fort had been 
aptured by the invaders, who immediately led a 
riumphant march about the field of battle. 
Snow fights afford splendid opportunities for the training of the 
combative instinct, along with training in manipulation of plastic 
terial. Such plays may include team wrestling, pushing, and

throwing, all under strict rules enforced by group leaders. Tumbling 
about in soft snow is much enjoyed by children, as is the making 
of snowballs and forts. 
8. Fighting Play.'— “ A most interesting house-play 
of a boy six years old. This child for several days had 
been observed closely by the play leader. He seemed 
abnormal in his conduct. He would often rush wildly 
about the playground with a big stick for a gun, 
shooting everyone he met and punching the other 
children. One day, however, he found some loose 
boards, stood them up to form a sort of wigwam, and 
announced that he had built himself a house. He 
furnished it in the crudest manner possible, using 
large stones for furniture. After a while he went 
over to a spot where some other children were keeping 
a store, bought some provisions, and took them to his 
home. He stayed there a few minutes until the play- 
ground closed. 
This was the first time the child had shown any 
interest in anything except rushing about, knocking 
others down, and shooting. A few days later, while 
shooting someone, he was evidently attracted by 
some handwork the children were doing, for he got 
piece of paper and made a wigwam, calling it ai 
Eskimo house. After a while he discovered a habita 
tion —a place — where some boards projected fro 
a little bank of sand. He crawled under this shelte 
saying that he was an Eskimo and that this was hi 
home. When next observed he had placed board! 
on the ground and had enclosed his home with a ro 
and sides. A large stone was the table and small 
1 Described by Helene Reed. 
         
 
-P-A-G-E-143
FIGHTING PLAYS 131 
round stones served as food. Little dishes filled with 
sand stood in a row along the front of his house. He 
himself sat contentedly inside, talking to everyone who 
came along and shooting at anyone who molested 
him. He said, “I’m the father; that fellow is my 
mother. He brings the pies from the store.” This 
play continued for some little time, the father doing 
the ordering, the mother baking the cakes in the store 
and bringing them home. After a while it was 
noticed that both boys sat in the house. On being 
questioned the father said, ‘‘The mother’s shot” 
(pointing to a child who had previously been the 
mother). ‘‘He’s my fellow; he’s the fellow that shot 
the guy that shot my mother. We're brave, we’re 
awful brave.’’ In a few minutes he left another boy 
in charge of his house; it was a hospital now, and he 
started out again to fight. 
     
   
                        
   
     
   In this play one is struck at once with evidences of a low type of 
intelligence; pleasure in mere manipulating of household furnishings, 
enjoyment of mere pushing unrelated to purposive play, quiescence 
in dramatizing a réle — all these indicate arrested development in 
boys of this age. It would be interesting to know the intelligence 
quotient of these boys who, surrounded by a wholesome play 
lenvironment, yet choose to sit under cover and live out a drama of 
his low order. The murder depicted orally shows again immature 
judgment acting upon chance experience.

  CHAPTER IX 
Priayinc HospitaL AND FUNERAL 
Many. Traditional Games Represent Death and 
Burial. — In the childhood of the race we find many 
traditional games originating in funeral services or in 
magic rites performed for the healing of the sick and 
wounded; such games are Green Grass, Green Gravel, 
Jenny Jones, Old Roger, Wallflower, and Booman. Many 
folk dances, also, represent in dance pantomime moods 
of grief and sorrow; such is Lot is Tod. Children 
play these games without a knowledge of their 
content. After the meaning has been lost the words 
are repeated as nonsense jingles, and the games are 
enjoyed because they abound in movement, rhythm, 
and repetition; and because they usually appeal to the 
social instincts. 
The Child Does not Dramatize Grief and Sorro’ 
but the Situations in Which They Occur. — Childre 
show the same primitive tendency to incorporate i 
dramatic play experiences representing joy or sorro 
as does primitive man. They do not repeat th 
experience in play for the purpose of intensifying 
mood of joy or sorrow, as adults sometimes do whe: 
they relive such experiences in memory or when the 
record events in works of art. Children’s joys an 
sorrows are short-lived and their dramatic enactment 
of adult grief and sorrow are a representation not of th 
emotions of adults, but of the striking features in t 
situations which call forth the display of emotions.

          PLAYING HOSPITAL AND FUNERAL 133 
Why Such Plays Appeal to the Child. — There is 
scarcely a household that is untouched by the ravages 
of sickness and death; scarcely a child that does not 
reproduce such experiences in play. If this seems 
strange to the adult it is because he does not put him- 
self in the child’s place, and recall the mystery and 
awe with which in his own childhood he contemplated 
the slowly moving funeral procession; the strange 
majesty of the bowed people veiled in black, the busy 
coming and going of folk to the homes; the crape, the 
flowers, the music, and numerous other interesting 
sights and sounds which attend the last rites of the 
dead. Similar to a child’s fondness for playing 
funeral is his desire to ride in the patrol wagon. A 
child in the Pittsburgh playgrounds once remarked, 
“When I get big, I’m going to ride in the patrol 
wagon; my father has gone in it twice.” 
The Child’s Attitude toward Sickness and Death 
ifferent from the Adult’s. — A young training-school 
ritic once visited a kindergarten where some practice 
tudents were anxiously awaiting her help. One of 
hese students tried vainly to interest some four-year- 
Id children in the Third Gift building lesson, but to 
o avail; in desperation she gave the children some 
enny dolls with which to play. One little girl said 
er doll had died and should be buried. From that 
oment the children became interested and the play 
ok care of itself. The young teacher entered spon- 
neously into the game and several funerals and 
rials were dramatized with great interest. The 
ung critic teacher was horrified to see an example 
a ‘‘negative’’ play. She did not seem to see the 
     
 
-P-A-G-E-146
    
    134 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
matter-of-fact way with which the children reproduced 
the common occurrence of death; nor did she recognize 
that their attitude toward sickness and death was 
different from the adult’s attitude. To her, death 
was associated with grief and the breaking of ties, and 
to play a game about it was sacrilegious.

1. Dr. Smith’s Hospital. Lawrence Park Play- 
room. — Dr. Smith sat at a long table rolling tissue- 
paper bandages. By his side was his medicine 
closet, containing several cups filled with water. 
The play began when Dr. Smith announced he had no 
babies to care for. Some little girls who were giving 
their dolls a tea party jumped up and made prepara- 
tions to visit the hospital. One girl brought her 
doll over in a go-cart. Dr. Smith looked at the doll, 
   
-P-A-G-E-148
  
  136 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
then carried it behind the screen which marked off 
the hospital and handed the doll to the vaccinating | 
doctor. This doctor pushed up the doll’s sleeve and 
found a round pencil mark which he said was yester- 
day’s vaccination. Dr. Smith supervised the putting 
on of a new bandage, then returned to his work cutting 
bandages and rolling them up. Soon another doll 
appeared and was said by Dr. Smith to have its arm 
hurt. He took it out to the ward and laid it carefully 
on the mattress. ‘‘Now I want a nurse,’’ he said. 
Straightway a girl of nine years appeared. Dr. 
Smith looked her over, then said abruptly, ‘Get a 
cap!’’ She disappeared and came back wearing a 
tissue-paper cap and apron. ‘‘Stay in the ward!” 
said Dr. Smith. She went back of the screen and 
bent over the sleeping doll, covering it with a small 
blanket. Another doll appeared. ‘Croup!’ said 
Dr. Smith, and ordered the doll to be put into the 
white iron bed. Presently two mothers came to 
inquire about one of the babies. Dr. Smith waved 
his hand and said, ‘‘Show them the one with the lace 
on its dress.”” The vaccinating doctor came into the 
office and announced, ‘‘Two babies are dead.” This 
remark occasioned no surprise or regret to either] 
doctor. Shortly afterward Dr. Smith called to th 
play leader and said, ‘‘I want a knife to operate with.”’ 
Just then another doll appeared. ‘‘Typhoid!”’ sai 
Dr. Smith, as he handed her to the nurse. ‘‘ Measles!’ 
he said to the mother who had just brought in anothe 
baby. These dolls were put in separate beds and thei 
mothers told to come back at two o'clock. Two othe 
mothers were also sent home to await that hour

boy clanged an imaginary bell, shouting ‘‘ Ding!

finally persuaded a mother to send her child to the 
hospital. The vaccinating doctor had wandered out 
to watch some boys at play. He was called back 
sharply by Dr. Smith, who said, ‘‘Come on! You ain’t 
got no time to watch that!’’ The piano signalled it 
was time to put the toys away. ‘‘Oh!”’ said the nurse 
with regret. ‘‘I’ll use these rolls tomorrow,” said 
Dr. Smith, putting the bandages in the box. ‘‘And 
I'll be the nurse,”’ said the little girl. 
The spirit and zest with which this play was conducted reveal 
the real character of dramatic play. These children played with 
the same singleness of aim-and sincerity of purpose that character- 
ize the work of the adult doctor and nurse. Dr. Smith’s attitude 
became solicitous, his bearing important, and his manner to the 
nurses curt and authoritative. 
     2. Hospital. Washington Park Playroom. — The 
hospital consisted of a row of beds made from large 
wooden blocks. <A doll covered with a white paper 
sheet lay in each bed. A head nurse and two assis- 
tants bent over the dolls, feeling their pulses and tuck- 
ing the clothes closer around the dolls. A special 
chair by the beds was reserved for the doctor, who 
presently appeared to examine the dolls. With 
nothing but a gesture of ‘‘All’s well,” the doctor left. 
3. War and Hospital. Ormsby Park Playroom. — 
war had taken place between Indians and cowboys. 
ix-year-old B, a favorite among the children, played 
e was hurt. He lay very still on the floor, the

     138 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
cowboy suit and red bandanna handkerchief he wore 
adding to the picturesqueness of the part he was play- 
ing. ‘We need a hospital,’’ said one child. Quickly 
the other children arranged two tables to represent a 
hospital ward, then bent over B. He stiffened and 
let them carry him to a table, where he lay very 
quietly, without once opening his eyes. A  self- 
installed nurse folded a tissue-paper bandage and 
pinned it around his forehead. Still B did not stir. 
“Time for your medicine,”’ said the nurse, as she 
lifted his head gently and poured two teaspoonfuls of 
water down his throat. At this B slightly opened his 
eyes, then closed them again. The other children had 
resumed the war game, so the nurse and B were alone, 
except for one boy who now made his appearance 
carrying a doctor’s satchel. He felt the patient’s 
pulse, looked at his tongue, then ordered him up. 
The nurse helped B into a chair and brought him a 
broom for a crutch. B put it under one arm and 
hobbled off to the scene of war, where he soon forgot 
all about being sick and joined the cowboys fighting 
the Indians. 
This play was most interesting to watch. It was quite evident 
that the make-believe sympathy of the nurse and the attention of 
other children were the objects B sought in playing the part. When 
the writer visited the playroom after an interval of a week B was 
still playing this rdle. 
4. Hospital Play.—Some children who were 
thrown together for a few days in a detention home 
became much interested in playing hospital. The 
following verbal descriptions were given by variou 
children. ‘‘We take the babies down to the hospital   
-P-A-G-E-151
  PLAYING HOSPITAL AND FUNERAL 139 
take the tonsils out, vaccinate, feel her hands, and 
feel her heart. On another baby, put vaccination on 
her foot. When they got headache we put cloth on 
their head; when they got earache we should put a 
hot water bag on it. Doctor comes in and feels 
baby’s hands and heart and opens her mouth and 
gives her some medicine. We need keys (real ones) 
to open the bathroom doors. When another baby 
comes, put it in stretcher and give it a bath. When 
their eyes hurt, put something like water in it. If 
their foot hurts, put white stuff and a rag on it. Put 
glass thing under their tongues. When they ain’t 
got no arm put new arm on it. Ambulance goes to 
house if they got a baby sick and bring it to hospital. 
Take it to bed on stretcher. When we (nurses) go 
home we go on car, and lady sets the table and lady 
gives us good things to eat — coffee, oranges, apples, 
cake. Can’t all go at once — only one by one so some 
one can take care of the babies. When the babies 
want something to eat they got to ring bell by bed. 
We clean the babies up.” 
Here we see the crude content of children’s minds. 
5. Cemetery. A Home Play. — A small boy bent 
eagerly over his task of arranging rows of sticks in the 
soft sand; when asked what he was doing, the boy 
looked up with a smile and answered, ‘Oh! making 
graves in a cemetery.”’ 
6. A Kitten’s Funeral. Sullivan Playground. — 
One day a kitten was killed on the playground by a 
stray dog. The children said the kitten should be 
buried. At once some of them began to dig a grave 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
  140 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
while others gathered around the dead body to guard 
it. A few children showed evidence of grief, but 
most of them were absorbed in the ceremony of burial. 
They buried the kitten and covered the grave with 
roses. A stone was selected and placed at the head of 
the grave. When the play leader went home that 
night two negro boys volunteered to watch the grave 
until supper time. 
7. Funeral. Soho Playground. — Two dead birds 
were found on the playground. The boys buried 
them and put tombstones on the graves. They also 
made a fence around both graves.

CHAPTER X 
PLAYING FIREMAN 
    
                                   
     Why Children Play Fireman. — Probably no single 
role is so frequently dramatized among groups of 
young children as that of fireman. Spontaneous 
attention naturally goes out to intense stimuli such as 
loud noises coming in the midst of quiet, to that 
which is unusual and novel in its appeal, to moving 
objects, and the like. Just as the tramping of 
soldiers’ feet and the parade of the town band entice 
children into the street, so the fire-engine dashing 
by, clanging its bells and sounding its shrill 
whistle, stirs up interest in dramatizing that event. 
“TLet’s play fire!’ is the cry. The boy or girl of four 
years becomes the ringing bell, the prancing steed, the 
courageous fireman all in one. ‘To the child of five or 
six years of age the plot unfolds larger possibilities and 
demands a differentiation of parts. “I’m the bell,” 
shouts one child. ‘I’m the hook and ladder,” declares 
another. The child having the clearest vision becomes 
the leader and assigns the parts. If his observations 
ave been good and his interest in details keen, he 
ecomes ‘‘chief’’ and organizes a fire department; 
elects horses or motor trucks and firemen to man 
hem; decides where the fire is to be and directs 
utting it out. Often his images are not clear, his 
nowledge not complete, then other children help him 
ut in constructing the plot and dramatizing it.

RECORDS OF FIREMAN PLay 
1. A Three-Year-Old Child’s Fire-Plays.!'—R began 
to play fire-engine shortly after moving to a neighbor- 
hood where a large fire department was located. 
Because his fire-plays throw some interesting light on 
the psychology of play, the enactment of a series of 
fire dramas is presented in this chapter. The first 
plays consisted of swiftly moving flights in an ex- 
press wagon. ‘Fire! Fire! Ding! Dong!’’ shouted 
the fireman as he sped along. This simple interest 
in movement soon gave way to a more varied plot. 
The front door steps were pressed into service as a 
burning house, a long board became the hook and 
ladder for rapid ascent into the realms above, a coiled 
rope served as hose, and imaginary sprinkling of the 
burning house gave rise to imitative sounds such as 
“Cz! Cz!" The active features of the play, rapid 
movement in a wheeled vehicle, climbing and manip- 
ulating such objects as hose and ladders, was the 
center of interest for some time. Fire-plays occupie 
at least two hours of this boy’s time every day durin 
that fall, and when the winter months made indoo 
play more prolonged, the center of interest shifte: 
from activity in a wheeled vehicle to activity on al 
fours as the boy pushed a toy fire-engine about. Th 
use of this fire-engine, a present to R on his fourt 
birthday, affords some striking examples of growth i 
mental imagery. For several days he was conten 
to push about this attractive fire-engine drawn bi 
three prancing steeds. The automatic clanging o

the bell, the race to the fire on all fours, satisfied 
temporarily the boy’s desire for activity, while interest 
in the mechanism of the new toy for the time being 
stifled the creative play he had been wont to engage in 
out-of-doors. Soon, however, houses appeared, built 
of blocks; long pillar-shaped blocks served as hose; 
while wooden rings represented coils of rope. Other 
blocks served as firemen who manipulated the new 
equipment. The boy would look carefully through 
his cupboards of toys, selecting new equipment suit- 
able for use in putting out fires. He would sometimes 
play for an hour with the toy, piling the truck full of 
objects representing pails, ladders, and the like; for 
each time the department passed the house he ob- 
served new objects in its equipment, while one big 
fire in the neighborhood revealed the uses to which 
the equipment could be put. Then this creation of 
his imagination was abandoned for a new fire toy 
constructed out of blocks from all the plastic materials 
e could lay hands upon. The properties of the new 
re department were much more numerous. True, 
he new motor truck could not be moved about, the 
orn did not blow, and the driver was less realistically 
arbed; but the life it portrayed was more real, for 
t was the creation of the boy’s imagination. He him- 
elf blew the horn, moved the wooden firemen here 
nd there, coiled and uncoiled hose, and rescued 
eople from the burning houses. His mind planned 
he fires, his voice sounded the whistle, his hands put 
ut the fire. The mental imagery thus initiated was 
ore satisfying than the physical activity he had used 
operating the gilded toy.

2. Fireman. Andrews School Playground. — A 
large fire near the school suggested this play. Some 
boys built a house of blocks. One boy said, ‘‘Let’s 
have a fire!’’ Two other boys produced a wagon 
filled with buckets of water; this was the hosecart. 
The boys in the house rang a bell and the firemen and 
hosecart came rushing to the burning house. The 
firemen knocked down the house while pouring water 
on it. The next day the play was repeated. A small 
boy built a stable near the house and placed a block 
inside to represent a horse. Although the firemen 
arrived very quickly the horse had burned and had to 
be buried. 
3. Fireman. Lawrence Park Playroom. — A cor- 
ner of the room was screened off for the engine house. 
Blocks indicated the horses’ stalls. Two children 
were harnessed in rope and stood awaiting the call. 
A fireman wearing a cap stood with a bell in his hand 
ready to ring it the minute an alarm of fire came in. 
At last some one shouted, ‘‘Fire! Fire!’’ The fireman 
rang the bell Jong and loudly while two other boy: 
took out the horses and dashed wildly off to the fire, 
followed by another fireman pulling an express wagon, 
As if by common consent all rushed to the furnac 
room, where the gas fire was burning brightly. On 
fireman jumped over the railing and climbed a fe 
steps up a ladder, which happened to be against th 
wall. He then pointed an imaginary hose at the to 
of the boiler, saying, ‘Sz, Sz!’ Next he ran down th 
ladder and called for an ax, which was handed to hi 
by the fireman in the hosecart. The other firema 
ran over to the furnace door and played he wal

   PLAYING FIREMAN 145 
pouring a stream of water through the crack, where 
the fire was seen to be burning brightly. ‘‘Get my ax 
from under the seat,’ he cried excitedly. As an 
imaginary ax was handed him, he chopped vigorously 
at the wall. After this the fire was considered to be 
put out, and the firemen went home. Ina few minutes 
the same children played it all over again. This time 
after the fire was put out one of the firemen went to 
his house and slept. He got up, drank a cup of 
water, and returned to the engine house. Here he 
harnessed his horse and dashed around the room two 
or three times. When he came back he said, ‘‘See 
the new shoes I got him.” 
As interest in this play grew, all the girls and boys 
in the playroom became a part of it. The plot 
increased in complexity from day to day as different 
children suggested new ideas. More stalls were 
made, ropes were coiled to represent hose; the firemen 
slept when not called out; a policeman walked up and 
own near by and gave the alarm. It became 
ecessary to make the house-play a permanent part 
f each fire in order that the fire department could 
ontrol the time and place of each fire. So some of 
he family agreed to go to bed and let a policeman 
iscover a fire in their dwelling. This policeman 
roke the door, aroused the sleepers, and gave out the 
larm. The firemen jumped out of their beds and 
he horses began to prance and were quickly harnessed 
© an express wagon into which a fireman threw a coil 
f rope. The remaining firemen followed in the hose- 
art, one of them clanging a bell. The members of 
he family stood in the second story of their house and

were rescued by a brave fireman who threw them 
ropes from which to slide to the ground below. The 
other firemen poured water on the house. One fire- 
man was hurt and had to be taken to a hospital 
managed by some girls. Then the firemen and hose- 
cart returned home and prepared for another fire. 
This play lasted for two weeks. It is interesting to see how 
natural it was to select a real fire as the scene of the conflagration. 
And when this place was given up in favor of a site where a family 
lived, how realistically other details were worked out! The steps 
of the slide became the second story of a house and real rope was used. 
as hose. A bell and whistle also added greatly to the reality of the’ 
play. All these points are of significance to one who watches the 
development of the plot. 
4. Fire and Hospital. Andrew School Play- 
ground. — A large number of children who were play- 
ing ring games wanted to play fire. One group used 
the circle of playmates to represent a house. Anothe 
group did likewise. Someone suggested having some 
people sleep in each house, so the two children wh 
had claimed the houses selected families. One bo 
wanted to be a policeman. The members of eac 
family lay down to sleep and then the policemai 
shouted, ‘Fire! Fire!’’ In the meantime, several 
firemen had found children who were willing to b 
fire horses and had harnessed them up in ropes. Th 
fireman now drove to the two houses and worke 
vigorously to put out the fires. One member of 
family was hurt in making his escape from the burn 
ing house and was rushed off to a hospital. Here hi 
leg was pronounced broken. 
It is quite evident that these children were accustomed to th 
kindergarten gesture plays; in perfectly spontaneous play, a ring 
not usually suggested to represent a house.

      .Children Imitate the Movements and Character- 
istics of Animals. — The world is full of the wonder of 
things to a growing boy or girl. Butterflies, bees, 
caterpillars, birds, frogs, fish, horses, cows, sheep, and 
chickens are a child’s natural playmates. He feels a 
kinship with these living things, not because he 
possesses by instinct a presentiment of the common 
source of life, but because living, moving things 
challenge his attention; worms crawl across his 
path; squirrels scamper away at his approach; ants 
build their homes under his feet; birds twitter above 
his head; butterflies challenge him to a chase. While 
he can neither fly like a bird nor swim like a fish, the 
child’s imagination soars aloft with the swallow 
poised on high and penetrates again to the haunts 
where the darting minnow lives. ‘‘I’m a bird!” he 
cries, as he skims over the ground with outstretched 
arms, flying now fast, now slowly; hovering near the 
leafy trees, hopping in the green grass; in fact, reliving 
and reinterpreting the great panorama of life spread 
lout before his searching eyes. 
What Children Copy. — What children copy in their 
dramatic representation of animals is directly related 
o what interests them and claims their attention. 
nd since the child’s attention varies with age, sex, 
nd experience, his play is never the same. There 
re, however, certain significant things about a child’s 
147
-P-A-G-E-160
148 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
capacity for attention which apply to his manner of 
playing animals, and certain changes can with a fair 
degree of certainty be predicted to occur with age 
and experience. Little children notice animals be- 
cause of their motion and their novel and unexpected 
behavior. The sharp, quick contrasts in their move- 
ments, some in water and some on land, call forth 
interest and attention. A fly buzzing by, horses 
prancing and running, birds flying, — all these chal- 
lenge the attention. And in all imitative-dramatic 
play these striking or characteristic acts of animals 
are seized upon and copied; dogs bark at cats; lions 
stalk and roar; tigers crouch and spring; and so on 
through the cycle of actions portraying the behavior 
of animals. 
After children have become acquainted with animal 
life through watching the movements and behavior of 
animals, their attention spreads out to embrace the 
series of acts which are characteristic of each creature 
in its particular environment. How a bird lives, 
what it eats, how it gets its food, where it finds it, are 
points of contact which develop naturally from 
excursions. Kindergarten games are made up of 
simple contrasts of the events in bird and animal life. 
Birds fly and hop, eat, bathe, lay eggs, and rear their 
young. House dogs bark at cats and strangers, bury 
bones, and beg for food. Caterpillars crawl and spin, 
rest in cocoons, then emerge as butterflies. Ponies 
prance and gallop, are rubbed down, fed, and put in 
barns for the night. Lambs graze and gambol. 
Circus horses dance and race and perform various} 
tricks.

     Why Some Kindergarten Games Violate the Mind’s 
Laws of Attention. — Many of the traditional kinder- 
garten songs and games violate the principles of 
attention as exemplified in the child’s interest in 
motion and change and his continuance of attention 
to one subject. These games are so constructed that 
they represent dull, monotonous behavior of animals 
with few contrasts in movement and are continued to 
the point where interest dwindles entirely away. 
Children of kindergarten age are not interested in 
earning ‘‘all’’ about birds, or squirrels, or horses. 
They approach these creatures from the standpoint of 
xpression; squirrels run briskly and hunt nuts; birds 
y, hop, and dig for worms or insects. In helping 
hildren to understand animals, kindergartners have 
ever emphasized structure at the expense of function 
s some primary schools have shown a tendency to do. 
olding true to the expression type of play, the 
indergarten has emphasized the function of animals; 
t has shown what these creatures do as they come in 
ontact with the world. It has, however, as has just 
een indicated, built up plays and games revealing a 
hole cycle of animal behavior, forgetful of the fact 
hat an adult can hold in the focus of attention a 
vhole series of thoughts, but that a child centers his 
ttention on one characteristic of that object. The 
indergarten game, song, or rhythm should be short, 
nd reveal only sharp contrasts in movements and 
cts. With age and development of thinking capa- 
ity, relationships in thought are built up. Even 
efore the kindergarten period has passed, however, 
me games can be constructed which contain a series
-P-A-G-E-162
  Pray ANIMALS
-P-A-G-E-163
  PLAYING ANIMALS I51 
of acts arranged in a certain perspective around some 
point of dominant interest. 
Appreciation of the Value of Life. — Having ap- 
proached animal life from the standpoint of expres- 
sion, the child readily takes the step to the why, what, 
and how. Children see animal behavior in relation to 
their own social contacts and only gradually come to 
understand the kinship of all living things through 
observing their mutual dependence and their individ- 
ual functions. Only when children see the usefulness 
of each creature will they learn to respect its life and 
pursue it with eyes and camera rather than with 
destroying hands. We expect too much from children 
when we think they see themselves as a part of one 
great living universe. It requires years to build up 
this conception. 
Ethical Training Through Play With Animals.— 
The ethical values arising from contact with animals 
develop along with the appreciational values. Kindli- 
ness may be developed and brutality restrained. In 
playing with animals, as well as in dramatic repre- 
sentation of their habits and activities, children 
display native kindliness, sympathy, or cruelty. 
Just as with most of us kindliness predominates over 
cruelty, so in children’s relationships with animals we 
see kind actions imitated most frequently in childish 
play. On the whole, animals are petted and indulged 
by children. However, there are times when children 
lack sympathy and kindliness because for the time 
being other instincts are stronger. For example, boys 
tie tin cans to a stray dog’s tail in order to indulge in 
merriment. For the time being, the excitement and
-P-A-G-E-164
  
     
                                                   
   152 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
fun so fill their minds that their imaginations remain 
inactive; they fail to put themselves in the place of the 
creature they are tormenting. Children often kill 
birds and small moving creatures unthinkingly because 
the impulse to throw operates, before imagination 
pictures the physical distress of the life to be de- 
stroyed. The boys described in the playground 
record as chasing and killing a chicken which they 
found scratching up their garden were acting upon the 
impulse operating most strongly at the time (p. 162). 
It is within the possibilities of supervised play to 
build up right habits of sympathy and kindliness by 
working for appreciation through observation and 
the care of pets. For example, as soon as children 
learn what ants do for us they are eager to protect the 
tiny creatures. The following illustration of training 
in sympathy is taken from the writer’s records. One 
day a mother and child spied a young robin panting 
in a hedge near their home. The mother robin 
hovered near, protecting her young by threatening 
and warning cries. The boy and his mother decided 
to leave the robins alone for a time, thinking the 
young robin might recover enough to fly back to the 
tree. The mother supposed her child was looking at 
some books. Presently he appeared, saying excitedly, 
“The robin is dead! A giant came into the yard and| 
killed him! No! a bad boy did it.’ A visit to th 
hedge revealed two of the boy’s Indian clubs lying i 
close proximity to the dead robin. Without com 
ment the mother went. back into the house with he 
four-and-a-half-year-old boy. Presently she said, “ 
should be so happy to know what really happene
-P-A-G-E-165
PLAYING ANIMALS 153 
to the robin.’ Feeling her sympathy, the boy 
exclaimed enthusiastically, “I hit the robin with my 
Indian club! I petted him. The first club rolled 
away so I threw another!” Realizing that the 
throwing propensity had been the strongest impulse 
operating, the mother set to work to build up sym- 
pathy through imagination. She pictured the poor 
mother robin looking for her young bird and finding it 
dead. She took her boy to the door where they 
listened to the call of the mother robin. ‘Then the 
boy’s mother talked about the useful work robins do 
and spoke of their charming songs. Because contact 
with birds was likely to recur again and again in the 
  LEARNING THROUGH OBSERVATION

154 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
boy’s life, the mother decided to associate punishment 
with the boy’s first act of cruelty to birds. The boy 
was sent upstairs after lunch to remain until his 
supper time, “lest other young robins should be 
harmed.’’ When the boy came down stairs to supper 
he said, ‘‘The poor mother robin is looking for her 
little bird!’’ The tones of the boy’s voice were but a 
reflex imitation of the ones the mother had used in 
speaking sympathetically of the dead bird. The 
mother realized there was no basis for permanent 
sympathy between the child and birds, and set to work 
to build up in her child’s mind an appreciation of 
bird life through feeding the birds in the yard and 
observing their habits. 
Parents can take even little children to near-by parks 
where birds of many varieties can be seen; where 
squirrels will feed from the children’s hands and fish 
sport in the fountains. Much can be accomplished in 
these early contacts with living things to establish by 
example a sympathetic approach. True, a child’s 
first sympathetic acts are purely reflex imitation, but 
accompanied by training in observation, native kind- 
liness gradually asserts itself. Both kindliness and 
sympathy operate in the midst of many individualistic 
tendencies and require parental nurturing to wax and 
grow strong. They are not very definite tendencies at 
best and are easily choked by selfish ones. To retain 
them and adjust them to useful purposes is an impor- 
tant duty of educators. 
Scientific Values. — As soon as children arrive at 
the age when they can observe the characteristic 
features of an animal’s habitat, its manner of securing 
 
-P-A-G-E-167
  
    
 
-P-A-G-E-168
   
  156 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
food and rearing its young, and even its structure, 
“nature hikes”’ are of great advantage. In the Pitts- 
burgh playgrounds these hikes were conducted by 
nature-study teachers and became purposeful excur- 
sions in which observation and the camera took the 
place of chasing, throwing, and killing. Many speci- 
mens were brought home alive to be nurtured in a 
park zoo. It was noticed that as soon as the children’s 
imaginations were trained so that they could put them- 
selves in the place of the animal studied, killing and 
wanton chasing occurred less frequently. The scien- 
tific value of these nature hikes lies almost entirely in 
the habits of mind the child forms. Mere getting 
acquainted with animals and pets should lead to the 
habit of identification and comparison with other 
similar animals. 
Symbolism not Common in Children’s Portrayal of 
Animal Life. — Because play is life and life is play, no 
separation is made in the records between plays with 
real animals and dramatic representations depicting 
their lives and habits. The records show little 
symbolism. Whatever premonitions of kinship with 
animal life occur are hidden from the eyes of even the 
trained observer. The last dramatic play described 
in the records happened to be the only dramatic repre- 
sentation of the home life of birds which was recorded 
in the program notes of thirty playgrounds for al 
period of four years. A perusal of the records o 
dramatic representations of animals reveals the pre-+ 
ponderant part physical activity plays in anima 
games, and the fact that most dramatic representation 
of animals end in chasing games.

to see how intimate a part constructive or manip- 
ulative activities assume in dramatic plays. Especi- 
ally in plays with toy or real animals, or in impersona- 
tions of animals, we see the hands try to work out 
through plastic materials the images the mind 
supplies. Even a three-year-old devises some kind of 
shelter for his toy animals and pets. The records 
show how spontaneously children invent crude cos- 
tumes and accessories to make the rdle they are 
enacting more realistic. 
Constructive Activities Which may be Used to 
Assist Kindergarten Children in the Observation and 
Care of Animals. — For children of kindergarten age, 
clay, wood, cardboard, and paper are the best plastic 
materials to use for constructive work related to the 
care of domestic pets and animals. In connection 
with bird observation, children of kindergarten age 
like to make nests and eggs and birds of clay, to build 
bird houses of cardboard, to make feeders and foun- 
tains, and to play out dramas describing bird life. In 
this way they find out about the habits of birds in the 
neighborhood and learn to identify a few birds and to 
see their manner of securing food, shelter, and pro- 
tection. 
Animal Life. — Nearly every kindergarten is sup- 
plied with a menagerie made of cardboard or rubberoid 
and with a set of toy animals. The children build 
shelter for these animals, in this way learning a few 
facts about the homes of the wild animals, how they

prepare for cold weather, how domestic animals. are 
pastured, and how domestic pets are cared for, as 
well as how animals are cared for in the zoo. Clay, 
cardboard, paper, and paint are also used in expression 
work to depict the habits and habitats of the birds and 
animals observed. 
Constructive Activities Assist Children of the 
Primary Grades in the Observation of Animals. — As 
soon as children can be taken on walks or excursions 
by their teachers, they plan and execute many proj- 
ects which assist them in the pursuit and capture of 
animals. The following is a list of toy models made 
by children from seven to ten years of age in connec- 
tion with supervised hikes planned by the nature-study 
department of the Pittsburgh Playground Association: 
fish nets, polliwog nets, butterfly nets, ants’ nests, 
aquaria, vivaria, developing cages, mounting boards, 
bird houses, pigeon houses, squirrel cages, bird cages, 
cages for white mice, dog houses, rabbit pens, traps, 
fishing tackle, bait cages, and box traps. 
An Outline of Study Relative to the Use of Such 
Play Models. — In a recent publication are offered 
some very complete outlines for the study of animal 
life. The author has followed the functional point of 
view. For the teacher who knows how to use the 
suggestions in a spontaneous way the outline may be 
most helpful, and is for this reason referred to in thi 
study of spontaneous play.!

   1. Fish. Outdoor Playroom, New York City. — 
A child stood on some steps and threw a rope out 
toward several/children who were ‘‘fish swimming” 
on the floor. /Two fish came up to bite and the 
fisherman tugged with all his might to pull them in. 
“T’m a sharkj’’ said one child as he fastened himself 
on to the rope; “catch me!”’ 
Although this game was one of great physical activity, the 
dramatic interest was none the less keen. 
2. The Duck’s Swimming Lesson. Ralston School 
Ptayground. — A little boy brought his pet duck to 
the playground and put it in a tank used for water 
plays. He proceeded to give it a swimming lesson 
regardless of the fact that the duck profited nothing 
by the instructions, but reacted to the water in typical 
duck fashion. : 
3. Rabbits. Junction Hollow Playground. — A 
woman living just opposite the playground had a 
pair of rabbits in her back yard. Every day the 
hildren watched the rabbits and became more and 
ore interested. One day the rabbits escaped from 
he cage. The children chased them and brought 
hem back. Then they wanted to play rabbit. The 
atural thing, of course, was to construct a game tell- 
ng the story of the playground rabbits. First the 
hildren were satisfied to sit up on two feet and to 
op, run, and eat. Then they wanted a cage; several 
hildren made one by joining hands. This at once 
ave a new incentive to the rabbits, who began to 
ry to climb out over and under the children’s arms.
-P-A-G-E-172
  
160 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
One of the rabbits broke through and the children 
forming a cage ran after it. This freed the other 
rabbits and a general chase ensued. Each child who 
caught a rabbit brought it back, and then the children 
discovered there was no cage. One boy said that 
those who made the cage ought to keep in their 
places, while the others chased. This worked very 
well. The play leader suggested that each child 
capturing a rabbit should take this rabbit’s place in 
the next game, while the rabbit caught should take 
the place of some child who was part of the cage. 
One day the play leader added zest to the game by 
changing the words of Rabbit In the Hollow to follow 
the game the children had constructed. The children 
made rabbit caps with long ears and played with 
great interest the following chasing game:    
   
    
    
   
   
      
    
   Rabbits in the yard sit and sleep; 
Children in the playground nearer creep. 
Little Rabbit, have a care. 
Far away out there; 
Quickly to your homes 
You must run, run, run. 
This play is an interesting example of the evolution of a game of 
skill. Many of our traditional games of skill were originally dra: 
matic games which have now lost their content and meaning. 
4. Butterflies and Grasshoppers. Greenfiel 
School Playground. — These children played on 
wide stretch of grass at the top of a hill. Here the 
had a chance to sit under the trees, where occasionall 
they observed ants and bees, butterflies and gras: 
hoppers. One day some children began to hop lik 
grasshoppers and to chase each other around an

           around. The play leader suggested that some be 
butterflies and chase the grasshoppers. This idea 
was greeted with great delight. At first the chase was 
aimless. Then someone said, ‘‘Let’s pair off.” So 
each butterfly chose a grasshopper and at a given 
signal the butterfly flew and the grasshopper leapt 
toward a goal. Generally the butterflies won, be- 
cause of the difficulties of locomotion in hopping; so a 
handicap became necessary. 
This game grew in interest and was finally used at 
a ‘‘game-fest.”” Butterfly and grasshopper caps were 
made of colored crépe paper and added much to the 
dramatic interest of the game. 
5. Reindeer. Ormsby Park Playroom. — A rein- 
deer, a boy of five, was running about the playroom. 
little girl reached out her hand to pet him and 
traightway four other reindeer appeared. A boy 
rranged a cave out of chairs and called out, ‘Here, 
ere, come and live here!” ‘‘We ain’t bears, we’re 
eindeer,” replied one child. He allowed himself to 
e enticed into the cave, however, and lay down 
here. Soon he ran out and joined the other reindeer, 
who were grazing near by. Again the boy of the 
ave called, ‘‘Come on, Father Reindeer!” ‘‘We 
in’t Father Reindeer,’ said a boy of seven, ‘‘we’re 
ust reindeer.”” Then the reindeer began to scramble 
round widely and knock into some little girls who 
ere watching them. ‘“‘Let’s be goats,’’ suggested 
ne boy; ‘‘then we can horn and butt.” So all 
ashed madly around the room, trying to butt the 
ttle girls, who hid behind each other ‘screaming 
Ind laughing. After the fun:had subsided, the play

leader made a chalk mark across the room and sug- 
gested that the reindeer live on one side and the goats 
on the other. This led to a great scrambling and 
chasing. Whenever either ventured on the other’s 
territory, the one getting caught had to help the 
other side. The sides kept about even.     
                          
   
      
       
       Here is an example of spontaneous dramatic play. Butting and 
chasing were the points of the game; that dramatic interest was 
subservient to the use of oppositional force is indicated by, “Let’s 
be goats, then we can horn and butt.” 
6. Chicken. Junction Hollow Playground. — One 
day the boys had worked hard to make a garden on the 
playground. That night a chicken got in and 
scratched up the seed. Some boys living near by saw 
the disaster and, running after the chicken, killed it. 
Then the woman who owned the chicken came out 
and scolded the boys. The next day this story wa: 
related to the play leader with great excitement, 
She reprimanded the boys for killing the chicken bu 
encouraged them to watch the garden. She then se 
the boys to work making a fence out of sticks and 
string. That day the children constructed a chicke 
game. One piece of ground was marked out for th 
garden, another for the woman’s house, and stil 
another for the boys’ house. A boy became th 
chicken; he ran into the garden and started to scratc 
up the earth. This was a sign for the boys to begi 
their chasing, which continued until the chicken wa: 
caught. The boy who succeeded in catching th 
chicken became chicken, but if any boy was caught b 
the woman he had to help her chase the other boy:

Another example of the spontaneous development of a game of 
skill from a dramatic event. 
7. Birds. Ormsby Park Playground. — The chil- 
dren became much interested in watching a family of 
young birds living just outside the playground. 
Every day they saw the father and mother birds 
feeding and caring for their young. One day the 
children played birds. Four of them were baby 
birds, while two more were mother and _ father. 
They flew around getting worms, which they-dropped 
into the open mouths of the baby birds. Since the 
children had not seen the birds learn to fly, the play 
leader brought pictures the next day to supply this 
xperience. After that it seemed natural and easy 
‘o introduce the game ‘‘One Little Birdie Learned to ly.”

   A MiscELLANEOUS COLLECTION OF DRAMATIC PLAYS 
i. Shoemaker. Lewrence Park Playroom. — 
Two boys wanted to be :noemakers. They enclosed 
a space with chairs and brought in a table to use as a 
work-bench. They made shoe soles out of paper. 
Some little girls who were playing house near by came 
over to order some shoes for their dolls; they left the 
dolls to be measured. The shoemaker stood the dolls 
up on a piece of paper and traced on paper some 
shoes to fit the dolls’ feet. With the tapping of a 
little hammer the shoes were put on the dolls’ feet, 
little paste serving to fasten them on securely. Soo 
the mother came back, inspected the shoes, and pai 
for them in paper money. The shoemakers no’ 
added a shoe-shining department to their store. Afte 
a while, two more mothers appeared with dolls to b 
fitted to shoes. At noon, the shoemakers closed thei 
shop by placing a chair in front of the open door 
They went home and ate an imaginary dinner serve 
by three girls. In the meantime some one broke int 
the store. The elder shoemaker caught and put ou 
the ropber; then both the shoemakers returned t 
their work. 
This play continued for forty minutes, although the two bo 
serving as shoemakers were left entirely alone for the last twen' 
minutes. They seldom looked up from their occupations, althou; 
all the other children, attracted by a new slide, were playing noisi! 
near by. This record shows the type of play characteristic of 
child of kindergarten age who is allowed to construct his plot wii 
very little suggestion.

2. The Elves and the Shoemaker. Lawrence 
Park Playroom.'— This play grew out of the 
children’s interest in the shoemaker and his work and 
activities, and was the culminating and _ artistic 
expression of that interest. 
     
   
                           
        
      Previous to the development of the play the chil- 
dren had visited a shoemaker’s shop and through con- 
versation, pictures, and play had gained some real 
idea and appreciation of the life and activities of the 
shoemaker and his importance in the community. 
It was about this time that the children became very 
fond of the story of the Shoemaker and the Elves, 
or the Brownies and the Shoemaker, as they called it, 
a story which I told them several times and then let 
them tell me, one child telling as much as he cared to, 
or could remember, the next child continuing from 
where the last narrator left off. Thus the children 
became very familiar with the story and there was 
lenthusiastic acquiescence in my suggestion that we 
lay it out. 
A shoemaker and his wife were chosen. They im- 
ediately set about arranging their shop. The piano 
tool was used for the shoemaker’s bench, a small 
indergarten chair served for his stool, and a kindly 
anitor was importuned into lending his hammer. 
he brownies departed to brownie land, which was a 
oom opening out of the playroom, and the door was 
Immediately metamorphosed into a window through 
hich the brownies entered the home of the shoe- 
aker. 
1 This play was developed and written up by Catherine Swartz.  
-P-A-G-E-178
    166 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
When we began playing, the children seemed to 
experience surprisingly little difficulty in finding 
words to express what they wished to say. This was 
probably partly due to the fact that they knew the 
story so well, and that rather than make our story 
merely descriptive we had incorporated the conversa- 
tion of the elves, the shoemaker, and his wife into it. 
With the action it was different; for though spon- 
taneous, it was often awkward. But the children as 
a group were quick to see where improvements might 
be made and to offer suggestions. Such questions 
from myself as, ‘‘What do you suppose the shoe- 
maker’s wife would be doing while the shoemaker was 
working at his bench?” or ‘‘How does your father 
work when he is tired?’’ would bring a response from) 
every child and the one we as a group thought best 
would almost unconsciously be incorporated into ou 
little play. So from a crude little dramatization i 
grew into quite a playlet, of which the children neve 
seemed to weary. 
We were especially fortunate in obtaining from th 
children’s library a set of large, beautifully conceive 
pictures depicting a party given by the elves to th 
fairies. These pictures, better than any verbal de 
scription could possibly do, gave the children a clea 
image of what funny, fun-loving, mischievous littl 
people brownies are conceived to be. 
The play as it was finally dramatized was in thre 
parts, the shoemaker’s shop being the scene of the 
all: : 
a. The husband works at his bench while the wi 
sweeps and dusts. The husband says he is tired: an

                         doesn’t see any use in working so hard when no one 
buys his shoes anyhow; the wife, putting her arm 
around him, tries to cheer him up, predicts better 
fortune for the morrow, and goes out to prepare 
supper, to which she soon calls her husband. Re- 
turning to the shop they decide that as it is getting 
dark and late they will go to bed. This they do. 
Just as the clock finishes striking twelve, the brownies 
come leaping through the window and dance about the 
room, poking their fingers and noses into everything 
they see. One finds the shoemaker’s hammer and an 
unmade pair of shoes, and, thinking it great fun, glee- 
fully calls the others to come and help him play shoe- 
maker. At cockcrow, when they are forced to depart, 
they leave behind a finished pair of shoes of exqui_ite. 
workmanship. 
b. The next morning the shoemaker enters his 
workshop and is delighted to find in the place of the 
cut leather he had left the previous night, a pair of 
exquisitely made shoes. He calls his wife, who is 
equally pleased, and predicts an early purchaser. 
The shoes have scarcely been placed in the show 
window when a customer enters the shop and buys the 
shoes, paying a good price for them. The shoemaker 
and his wife are in great glee and hurry off to town; he, 
to buy leather for more shoes; she, provisions for the 
house. On their return he says that he will cut out 
leather while she prepares supper. As on the previous 
night, supper over, they retire to bed, having decided 
before going that they would sleep with one eye open 
n the hope of seeing their mysterious friend, should 
@ come again. The brownies return and this time
-P-A-G-E-180
  168 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
make all the shoes for which the shoemaker has cut 
leather, departing as before at cockcrow. 
c. The shoemaker and his wife talk over the 
situation the next morning and as a mark of gratitude 
decide to make a little suit and pair of shoes for each 
of their little naked friends. They finish the suits by 
nightfall and spread them about the workshop before 
retiring. The brownies, who come back to play shoe- 
maker, find the suits and have a glorious time arraying 
themselves in them. When they have all put them 
on, they join hands and dance about the shoemaker’s 
bench, and as a final expression of joy perform the shoe- 
makers’ dance, the traditional dance which, through 
pantomime, shows the activities of the shoemaker. 
Just as they finish, the cock crows and the brownies 
disappear through the window, never to return. 
                                         
          
                 The repetition of situation, action, and speech, the great amount 
of activity, and the fact that all the children of a group can take 
part make this story ideal for use with a large group. 
3. Blacksmith. Lewis Playground. — After a visit 
to the blacksmith shop the children asked to pla 
blacksmith. Some girls assumed the rdle of mother 
of families living in different homes. Two boys kep 
the blacksmith shop. Another boy had a liver, 
stable and took care of the horses belonging to all th 
families. Other children took the part of horses 
The mothers went after the horses and took thei 
children for a drive. Something always happened t 
the horses’ hoofs; this occasioned a visit tc the black 
smith shop, where new shoes were put on. The blac! 
smith took each hoof between his legs and nailed on 
new shoe.

       4. Street Cleaners. Washington Park Play- 
ground. — Two boys swept and cleaned the play- 
ground every day. Each time they demanded pay 
and were given paper money. They took this to the 
store and with it purchased sand cakes, pies, or bread. 
5. Livery Stable. Homewood School Play- 
ground. — One child was the liveryman. He induced 
other children to be horses in his stable. Every few 
minutes he fed them, then drove them out to a water- 
ing trough to drink. One of the horses kicked and 
jumped, so had to be broken in. The liveryman tried 
out the other horses in teams of twos and threes. A 
man came to the livery stable to buy a horse. The 
liveryman showed off all the horses until the purchaser 
found one that suited him. 
‘6. A Telephone Play. Arsenal Park Play- 
ground. — Some little girls were playing house. A 
pay telephone happened to be located in one of their 
houses, but of course the children were not allowed 
to take down the receiver. So they planned to have a 
telephone of their own. By placing a chair under- 
neath the telephone the children could reach the 
mouthpiece. A receiver was constructed from a 
ribbon bolt and string, and the telephone was then 
connected with other houses. Then each member of 
he family took turns using the line. They called up 
embers of the other household, inquired after the 
abies, discussed the housework, and invited each 
ther to call. 
4. Telephone Flay. A Home Play. — The desk 
elephone was elaborate. It was made by sewing two 
ardboard rolls together and attaching a funnel-shaped 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
170 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
mouthpiece. The telephone was pinned to a table — 
and a small cardboard roll attached for a receiver. A 
cord connected the receiver with a similar telephone in 
another part of the room. One day the following play 
occurred. A seated herself at the desk and called 
central. B answered. ‘“‘Let’s have the line busy 
before we begin,” said A. ‘All right!’’ answered B. 
After several calls and reports of ‘‘line busy,” A 
succeeded in getting her number. B then took the 
place of the person called. “Hello!” said B and 
waited. “Is this L’s grocery?” asked A. “Yes,” 
came the answer. Then A replied, ‘‘This is Mrs. A’s 
residence. Won’t you send me a pound of butter 
and a loaf of bread? How much are bananas?” 
“Fifteen cents a dozen.’’ ‘‘You may send me half a 
dozen.”” ‘Yes, that is all for to-day.”” “All right, 
Mrs. A,” B replied, ‘I'll send them right over.” 
      
                                             A learned to use the telephone by playing this game. Previous 
to this time she had been timid about using the telephone. Con- 
versing with the other children also helped to sharpen her mind for 
ready answers to questions. 
8. Fishing. Lawrence Park Playroom. — One day’ 
the children began spontaneously to play boating. 
Some put the seats of two chairs together and sat on 
one chair with their feet on another. Other children 
played that the tables were boats. They used to 
brooms for oars and rowed vigorously. Each chil 
had a rope which he played was a fishline. He tie 
this line to his arm or to the boat and threw it ou 
into the water toward blocks scattered here an 
there on the floor to represent fish. Whenever 
rope touched a fish it was considered caught. If

child wanted to land, the fish line became a rope and 
was used to tie the boat to the dock. Some children 
took the fish to their houses and cooked them for 
dinner. 
9. Boats and Diving. Lewis Playground.—Three 
boys found a broad board near the playground and 
used it for a‘boat. With brooms for oars they rowed 
long and vigorously. After a while they took some of 
the girls out rowing. The girls sang “Lightly Row” 
while the boys worked at the oars. Another day the 
boys used the board as a skiff, carrying it on their 
shoulders around rapids and across narrow passes. 
After a while it became a diving board from which 
the boys jumped into an imaginary lake and then 
swam around. About a week afterward the same 
board was placed on a stump and converted into a 
merry-go-round. 
to. Ship Play. Washington Park Playroom. — 
The smooth inclined plane belonging to the children’s 
slide happened to be moved temporarily to the boys’ 
playroom. It had never been there before and the 
boys were having great fun rolling balls up and down 
its smooth surface. By and by six children got astride 
he slide and said they were on a boat. Brooms were 
ressed into service as oars and the rowing was ac- 
companied by a spontaneous chorus of “Ah!’’ One 
oy jumped out, seized a flag, and waved it at those 
till rowing. Then all got out, but the self-imposed 
eader, still waving the flag, made them get back into 
he boat. Someone suggested that water was all 
round them. One of the rowers immediately fell 
ut of the boat and began to swim; the others followed

   his example. One boy got into a large box which stood 
near and pushed it along the floor; immediately the 
rowers’ oars became guns and all shot ‘‘ Bang! Bang!” 
at the boy in the skiff. Then the swimming began 
again. 
This play lasted about half an hour. It was arranged by a 
group of Italian and colored boys about seven to nine years old 
and was a very spontaneous play. It does not show a high level of 
intelligence. The primitive “Ah! Ah!” of the rowers was a most 
interesting example of spontaneous rhythm accompanying an 
enjoyable activity. 
11. Dressmaking. Washington Park Play- 
room.'— It took a long time to invent a sewing 
machine, but when it stood complete it was certainly a 
glorious achievement from the children’s point of view. 
A large chair made a good framework. Two blocks 
for pedals were tipped upon a low front rung of the 
chair in such a way that the little seamstress could 
really make them go. A couple of spools placed 
upright a little distance apart on the chair seat and 
connected by a piece of heavy wire stood for upright 
and horizontal shafts. To the right, on one end of the 
spool, hung a circle of rope for a wheel, while a piece of 
heavy twine suspended below suggested a belt. As 
fast as the seamstress sewed, the cutter and fitter 
supplied her with newspaper and tissue-paper dresses 
for both children and dolls. 
By way of variety, the trade room changed one day} 
to a home scene where sat a sewing party. In th 
kitchen near by the food was prepared and cooked o. 
tiny stoves. A table was soon put in readiness

                             Spool candlesticks with lavender shades stood in the 
center of the table, while beside each of their places a 
miniature candle was placed as a favor. The guests 
stopped sewing when luncheon was announced. The 
hostess and guests seated themselves with due 
ceremony. A waitress in cap and apron served in 
proper style. But alas! when it was time for dessert, 
the ice cream had not come. The hostess telephoned, 
but to no avail, There was nothing to do but pass 
the cookies, which was done by the hostess herself. 
Then the serving began all over again. When the 
guests went home, one was heard to remark, “Let’s 
have another sewing party tomorrow.” 
Real cookies were served; the ice cream was imaginary. 
12. Train. Lawrence Park Playroom. — Two 
kindergarten tables with long sides placed together 
made an excellent car. Chairs arranged in rows of two 
were placed on top the tables. A small stand in front 
of the car became the coal car. The engineer sat in 
front of the coal car and manipulated the piano stool 
as a brake. The fireman shoveled coal into the 
engine, using a broom for a shovel. In the meantime, 
the station at the other end of the room was filling up 
with people. The steps of the slide became a ticket 
office, where an agent was kept busy preparing paper 
tickets for the long line of passengers. Every 
passenger was asked where he wished to go and was 
requested to show money before a ticket was given 
him. When all had secured tickets, the caller 
announced the train. Most of the passengers de- 
posited their baggage, consisting largely of dolls’  
-P-A-G-E-186
  174 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
cabs, in the baggage car under the table. After the 
passengers had seated themselves the conductor 
walked down the aisle and collected the tickets. The 
engineer sat in his cab and applied the brakes. The 
brakeman stood in the rear of the car and signaled 
with a flag and lantern to a switchman near by. 
Whenever the train was’supposed to change tracks a 
chair was moved from one place to another to repre- 
sent the switch. By and by the brakeman called, 
“Mexico.’’ All the passengers got off and stood in 
a line waiting for their baggage. The train crew 
went to the station to draw their pay. 
SUGGESTIONS FOR PROMOTING MANUAL ACTIVITIES IN 
’ CONNECTION WITH THE PLAys RECORDED 
Dramatic Plays Involve Constructive Activities. — 
It is almost impossible to separate the constructive 
plays from the dramatic, so intimately does one type 
of expression weave itself into the other. When a 
spontaneous dramatic play springs up the tendency is 
to use some static object in the environment as a 
background; to convert a chair into a boat, a sofa into 
an island, a hall closet into the retreat of bears. The 
attention is likely first to be centered upon the dra- 
matic. Interest, however, often turns to the details of 
the objects or events represented. Then is the 
teacher’s opportunity to assist in constructive proj- 
ects; to supply suggestive materials and pictures for 
these projects, leaving to the children the initiative 
as to ways and means and the uses of materials. 
In the shoemaker play the children attempt to make 
the shoes they wish to sell. The blacksmith play 
 
-P-A-G-E-187
A COLLECTION OF DRAMATIC PLAYS 175 
involved the construction of a shop equipment with 
the necessary tools to carry on the work of the black- 
smith. The telephone play involved some construc- 
tive skill in planning and making a telephone; fishing 
required the building of boats; dressmaking involved 
making a sewing machine; and the other plays re- 
corded could easily develop manual projects. It is 
almost impossible to conceive a dramatic play which 
does not involve some use of manual activities to 
embellish the mental imagery. 
1. Shoemaker. — In this play the boys, who were 
about six or seven years of age, could have been 
stimulated to build out of blocks or boxes a little 
store, and to equip it with tools resembling those 
used by the shoemaker. Shoes in the form of sandals 
could have been cut from cardboard to fit the chil- 
dren’s feet, then sewed into permanent form. Not 
only would the children acquire a fair degree of skill, 
but they would enjoy making shoes for customers. 
The making of shoes for real people involves a larger 
social purpose than the mere cutting and pasting of 
dolls’ shoes. Shoe-polishing could have been of the 
commercial type instead of being mere make-believe 
play. The making of toy money could have been 
incorporated into the play. This involves skill in 
tracing and cutting and could have been done by a 
group outside the store. The cardboard coins must re- 
semble rea} quarters, fifty-cent pieces, and dollars 
if the real value of money is to be taught through 
spontaneous play. 
2. The Shoemaker and the Elves began as a 
spontaneous dramatic play and finally crystallized
-P-A-G-E-188
  
176 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
into an art form involving dialogue and the dance. 
‘The constructive interest could have been utilized, 
however, in helping the children to make simple 
brownie suits and caps for the final performance of 
their drama at a playground festival. 
3. Blacksmith. — The play recorded is typical of 
the rough-and-ready dramatizations that spring up 
spontaneously on a summer playground. The chil- 
dren had visited a blacksmith’s shop and had gained 
some knowledge of his activities. What more natural 
than to build the anvil, construct a crude bellows, and 
make horseshoes and nails out of clay or paper? The 
dramatic play described involves social coéperation of 
an unusual degree, which should not be lost in an 
effort to embellish the drama by means of manual 
skill, The groups could take turns in impersonating 
families and dramatizing the work which goes on in a 
livery stable and a blacksmith’s shop, in order that 
all might relive the experiences of each unit in the 
play. 
4. Street Cleaners. — In the section of the city in 
which this play occurred, it is especially necessary to 
stress personal and group hygiene. The children of 
the entire playground could have been organized into 
a street-cleaners’ brigade and could have cleaned the 
playground or the street. Small shovels could have 
been constructed. Instruction in the hygiene of the} 
street could have been given through pictures and 
simple facts related to the dramatic play. 
6,'7. The telephone plays afford unusual oppor- 
tunities for the manipulation of blocks, wood, and 
other plastic materials. Children of kindergarten

age are easily satisfied with constructing a receiver 
and mouthpiece through which they can carry on 
conversations with their neighbors, order groceries 
for their tea parties, and telephone a doctor when their 
dolls are ill. Children from seven to ten years of age 
can learn by experimentation the simple physical laws 
involved in telephoning and can work out play 
projects illustrating the application of these laws. 
8, 9, 10, 12. Dramatic plays in which ships and 
trains are used afford splendid opportunity for con- 
structive activities. A set of rough floor blocks is 
useful in building large boats and trains possessing 
strength and capacity to hold several children. Long 
boards or tables can be used as a foundation, while 
wheels, cars, sails, and machinery can be added as 
eeded. 
Sometimes children prefer to make small models 
nd to play out the dramatic events individually by 
aking the boat or train go through certain move- 
ents and by supplying verbally the descriptions of 
hese movements. 
11. Dressmaking. — Many play projects involv- 
ng the use of manual activities arise in connection 
ith dressmaking plays. There is the opportunity to 
reate toy models of sewing machines, or to invent 
rude looms and toy knitters on which real sweaters 
ay be knitted for dolls and attractive rugs woven 
lor the dolls’ house. Children from seven to ten 
ears of age show an omnivorous appetite for building 
rude machines. They often study sewing machines 
nd get information concerning how these may be 
ade. In this way children acquire considerable
-P-A-G-E-190
178 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
skill in manual activities and obtain valuable mechan- 
ical information. 
Dressmaking projects also afford opportunities to 
teach children some knowledge of textiles. Color 
training can be made an integral part of this work. 
Skill in sewing by hand can be acquired as a means of 
working out some play project, such as making a cape 
for Little Red Riding Hood or a crude Quaker garb 
for a Thanksgiving festival.

   CHAPTER XIII 
THE DRAMATIC PLAYS OF ONE CHILD! 
The Importance of Studying the First Dramatic 
Expression. — So few of the dramatic plays recorded 
in the playground records have to do'with the child 
under five years of age, and so important are these 
early efforts at dramatic representation, that it seems 
advisable to present the records of one child’s dra- 
matic plays with notes on their psychological sig- 
nificance. In the case of each play activity presented 
for study it is possible to see why and how it arose 
in experience; thus we have a background for the 
interpretation of dramatic plays which it is impossible 
to supply in connection with the playground records. 
The First Dramatic Plays Have Their Roots in 
Reflex Imitation. — The infant’s first dramatic plays 
have their roots in reflex imitation. The child laughs 
with his mother; bursts out crying if she startles him 
by loud cries; imitates her gestures and tones of 
voice. Many times he does these things uncon- 
sciously, but gradually he does them with intention. 
When memory is developed so that he can retain in 
his mind two possible choices of action, a mental state 
rises which permits real freedom in play. It is 
ard to predict with any degree of certainty what the 
hild’s first dramatizations are likely to be, for he 
hows an almost uncontrolled tendency to respond to

his environment, both physically and socially, by 
imitating the things which challenge his attention. 
Thus R, brought up in a civilized community, natur- 
ally reproduces the mode of action common to his 
home and neighborhood, while a child reared in a 
savage tribe responds to the savage type of life. R’s 
repertoire of dramatic plays includes washing clothes, 
scrubbing floors, dusting chairs, pouring tea, etc. A 
child of the savage type of life builds fires, chases wild 
animals, imitates the acts of killing wild beasts, and 
engages in mimic warfare. 
The Outstanding Characteristics of the Dramatic 
Plays of Infancy are Activity and the Sensations Re- 
sulting Therefrom. — The outstanding characteristics 
of children’s early dramatic plays are enjoyment of 
physical activity and the resulting sense impressions. 
The subjective attitude is of more importance to the 
child than the objective result. This fact is important 
in interpreting the play of children under six years cf 
age. The record of the boy who was blissfully conten 
to use a turkey roaster as Santa Claus’s sleigh is on 
case in point; it is an example of the four-year-old’ 
satisfaction in activity for its own sake and in th 
sensations resulting therefrom. The turkey roaste’ 
permitted active locomotion over the floor and als 
served as a vehicle for toys; these were the sol 
requirements of a sleigh to this boy. 
Progression in Early Dramatic Plays.—In th 
early dramatic plays we see progression and increase’ 
complexity in both movement and ideas.  Progressio: 
in movement comes through adjusting the mechani 
of the large bodily movements to the purpose they ar    
   
  
-P-A-G-E-193
THE DRAMATIC PLAYS OF ONE CHILD I81    
                                      
      
   
    
   supposed to serve in play. For example, hopping 
like frogs involves adaptations from mere hopping. 
New sensations and ideas become tied up with the 
movements and produce modifications in hopping. 
Conversely, ideas grow in complexity as they find 
expression in movement. The action reacts on the 
idea back of it, modifies it, and brings suggestions of 
new ideas connected with movement. 
Looking through the following records of dramatic 
plays, we observe that the movements involved are 
reaching, pulling, hauling, pushing, running, walking, 
hopping, and jumping. During the second and third 
years the codrdinations connected with these move- 
ments are rapidly improving, for the fundamental 
movements become reflex during the first three years 
of childhood. Studies of the neuro-muscular system 
indicate that the first three years are the ones in 
which the movements connected with the spinal cord 
and the lower brain centers come into almost complete 
activity. 
After this development is completed, we see more 
freedom in the use of gross bodily movements. The 
child’s mind is then free to develop skill in using the 
movements for increasingly difficult acts. 
Progression in Ideas. — The infant’s first dramatic 
movements are usually gestures. Thus in the early 
part of the second year we see R playing that he 
reads, eats, warms diapers; in fact, performs the acts 
most closely associated with his physical welfare or the 
abits of those closest to him. Later he washes, irons, 
crubs, makes beds, dresses up like adults, and in fact 
elives all the events connected with the household.
-P-A-G-E-194
  
182 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
As soon as he gains wider access to the sights and 
sounds of the street, park, or country, we see him 
taking imaginary journeys on trains, boats, and 
automobiles. He delights to deliver ice and groceries, 
dine at restaurants, play the rdle of woodpecker, cat, 
dog, bear, frog, and alligator. Nor does he tire of 
representing household activities; he continues to 
wash, scrub, and cook. Pictures, stories, and excur- 
sions initiate him into the world of trade; he pounds 
like a blacksmith; works in a factory, builds airplanes, 
and runs a moving-picture show. He progresses not 
only in the type of dramatic acts he performs, but in 
the number of events he incorporates in one play. 
Thus at fourteen months he merely gestures to repre- 
sent eating or reading; at three years of age he relates 
eating to cooking and to feeding dolls, and relates 
reading to other acts of his father or mother. His 
plays show relations between ideas, in fact take on 
the nature of a plot. 
By the time he is five years of age, his dramatic 
representations reveal considerable complexity of 
idea and plot, as a perusal of the records will show. 
For example, R built a bridge under which he ran an 
engine; this in representation of a railroad scene he had 
recently observed. In an instant his play changed. 
Some chance association revived memory images of 
an experience he had heard about four months before. 
He brought out his motor truck. Placing a female 
doll on the seat, he said, “‘Here is Mrs. H taking a 
ride. Where is the cat?’’ A block became the cat; 
it jumped on Mrs. H’s lap, to be removed and thrown 
down by her son. Then a dog chased the cat up a

THE DRAMATIC PLAYS OF ONE CHILD 183 
tree. Here we see a series of dramatic events showing 
sequence. There was a beginning, a middle, and an 
end to the plot, and the arrangement of events in the 
plot varied only slightly from the relation of the events . 
in the incident he had once heard. 
The Role of Adult Suggestion in Connection With 
Early Dramatic Plays. — The mother or teacher plays 
an important réle in training her child’s imagination 
through dramatic play. There is a growing recogni- 
tion among parents of the power of suggestion. How- 
ever, where parents interfere and interrupt there is 
always the danger of breaking abruptly into the 
child’s mental life and of hindering growth by im- 
planting adult ideas. When the child begins to 
weave familiar incidents into a dramatic plot, it is 
best to allow him to organize his own ideas spon- 
taneously, since he alone knows the relationships 
which exist among the facts he is seeking to express. 
It is best always to let these ideas take natural form, 
and then to make suggesticns through questioning, 
stories, pictures, and statements of related facts which 
help to clarify and to organize his ideas. Even then, 
the child must do his own selecting and rearranging of 
facts in accordance with the natural growth which 
results from the suggestions. It is difficult for an 
adult to play the réle of happy playfellow and teacher 
inone. To acquire the ability properly to supervise a 
little child’s play requires real sympathy and a 
training commensurate with the seriousness and 
importance of the task.

184 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
RECORDS 
Imitative-Dramatic Acts of the First Year 
10 Months. — People sometimes entertain R_ by 
trotting their fingers across the tray of his high chair. 
R tried to do the same. He succeeded only in opening 
and shutting his fingers on the tray. A month later 
he scraped his tiny fingers across the tray, producing 
some semblance of the movement and noise he was 
trying to copy. 
11 Months. — R’s mother pretended to bite R’s 
finger when he placed it on her lips. R thought this 
great fun and laughingly continued the game. 
R sneezed. His mother did the same, laughing. 
R laughed almost hysterically every time she imitated 
his act. 
R sat behind a curtain and occasionally drew the 
curtain aside, laughing as his mother said, ‘‘ Peek-a- 
boo.” 
In these simple imitative acts which occurred at the 
close of the first year we see the beginnings of dramatic 
play. We notice the first crude efforts consciously to 
reproduce the acts of another. A sense of the fun of 
pretence is found in the finger-biting play. A realiza- 
tion of the comic is found in the reflex merriment 
resulting from the sneezing episode. 
Imitative-Dramatic Plays of the Second Year 
14% Months. — R was standing in his pen. His 
father jumped up and down outside, laughing merrily. 
R attempted to jump up and down. As he could not 
walk, he succeeded only in flexing his knees and 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
  THE DRAMATIC PLAYS OF ONE CHILD 185 
bobbing up and down. He showed unmistakable 
signs of pleasure from the kinesthetic effects of the 
imitative act. 
One day R’s mother playfully donned a silver bread 
dish as a hat. Later R laughingly slipped his doll’s 
hat to his head. At the time, this appeared to be an 
act of mere manipulative activity; however, he 
followed it up in a few days by placing other hat-like 
objects on his head — a box and an embroidery hoop. 
That social imitation occurs at an early age is seen 
in the following playful acts. R’s mother pressed her 
first finger on a rubber doll to make it squeak; R tried 
to produce the same squeaking noise by pressing his 
first finger on the doll. She rang a bell; he did the 
same. She waved a buttonhook in a circle; R waved 
it horizontally. She rattled a buttonhook about in a 
glass jar; R did the same. She tapped a buttonhook 
on her chair; R waved it horizontally. 
15 Months.— R always watched with interest 
when people lighted a fire in the gas grate with a wax 
taper. One day he found a broom straw; picking it 
up he attempted to light a fire in the grate. When 
supplied with a wax taper, he touched it to the grate 
several times and seemed disappointed that no flames 
sprang out. 
R warmed a diaper by holding it before the gas 
grate. It was a playful but serious attempt to 
reproduce an act connected with his own welfare. 
R read a newspaper. 
R ate from an empty dish and spoon. 
R dusted the floor with a diaper and scrubbed 
it with a brush. 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
  186 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
17 Months. — When his mother lay down in the 
library, R walked along the edge of the couch, pulled 
her nose, played ‘‘peek,” and laughed loudly at the 
slightest exchange of sociability. 
19 Months. — Hiding play. ‘‘Where is Chine?” 
said his mother. R looked under furniture, saying, 
“Gone!” 
21 Months. — Ironing. Using a warm iron R 
pressed out pads, sheets, and diapers. This activity 
lasted fully a half hour. 
Hide-and-seek. R’s mother hid in a corner. He 
ran to find her, laughing and falling into her arms 
when he discovered her. 
23 Months. — Playing with his shadow. R ran 
about, looking at his shadow as it preceded or followed 
him. 
24 Months.—Tea party. R had a new tea set. 
He filled each cup with water and drank, or emptied 
the water from one cup to another. 
Imitative-Dramatic Plays of the Third Year 
Sprinkled salt on a cloth and proceeded to powder 
his face. 
Swept the floor with a broom 
Squeezed an orange and strained the juice through a 
tea strainer. 
Held toast to his doll’s mouth. 
Applied a can opener with point down. 
Attempted to open a crate with the fork end of a 
hammer. 
Tried to mash vegetables through a sieve. 
Imitated a postman by carrying a bag and umbrella.

Played he cut bread by sawing a can with a stick. 
Poured water out of a coffee pot into cups. 
Cleaned a stove with newspapers. 
Attempted to stir food which was cooking on the 
range. 
Made his own bed fairly well, adjusting pad, sheets, 
and pillows; sometimes he pinned his doll in the bed. 
Shoveled snow, imitating both the digging and the 
throwing movements. 
Brushed his hair, imitating the downward sweeping 
motion. 
Held a curling iron to his head. 
In playing with a silver neck chain, he adjusted it 
across the front of his dress in imitation of his father’s 
watch chain. 
Tried to expectorate, making a queer little noise in 
his throat. 
25 Months. — R was taken to visit a friend in a 
hospital. He had been there but a short time when 
he began to cry, ‘‘ Bye-bye”’ and ‘‘Gar-Gar!’’ Grasp- 
ing a small valise he made several trips to the door, 
saying, ‘‘Bye-Bye!’’ each time he started on a trip. 
Later he put a newspaper on his head for a cap and 
with an increased sense of the fitness of things he 
went through the formalities of leave taking with 
added enjoyment. 
R indicated by means of gestures that he wished his 
cuffs turned up in imitation of those of a guest. Thus 
are trivial customs and acts acquired through social 
imitation. 
Doll Play. R attempted to pin a diaper on a small 
rubber doll. When his mother supplied a doll bed and 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
  
188 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
some extra materials for bedding, R derived consider- 
able pleasure from putting the doll in this bed and 
covering it carefully with a sheet. 
Mock sympathy. R threw a rubber doll to the floor 
several times, saying ‘‘Oh! dear!’ This effort to 
reproduce a situation in which he himself had ex- 
perienced sympathy is indicative of a growth in 
imaginative ability. 
Bathing his doll. R likes to bathe his rubber doll or 
celluloid duck while he himself is being bathed. He 
goes through the acts necessary for cleanliness. 
Imitating acts of companionship, R takes his doll 
to bed with him and asks for his Teddy bear. 
Simulating sleep. R plays he is going to sleep, 
covers himself with a blanket, and shuts his eyes. 
Here is another example of pleasure in pretending an 
experience which is distasteful in actual life. 
31 Months. — Ride a cock horse. Sitting on the 
foot piece of the sewing machine R rocked back and 
forth calling, ‘‘Get up ’orses!” 
Playing Pilgrim. R watched a pageant rehearsal. 
In a church scene R knealt down to pray and stood to 
sing with the Pilgrims. 
Playing stake driver. R watched some men drive a 
stake. He did the same, imitating their acts of digging 
and planting 
Engine. R enjoyed pushing two or three camp 
chairs across the floor of the camp dining room, saying 
“Choo-choo!”’ 
32 Months.— Playing boat. R sat in a tent ona 
low chair, pulling on a rope attached to the tent. 
“Here comes a boat!”’ he called out.

       Playing soldiers. R placed a closed umbrella over 
his shoulder for a gun and marched like a soldier. 
“Hip-one-two-three!’’ he called out. 
Mock discipline. During mealtime R is sometimes 
admonished for talking. One morning he admonished 
his mother, who was singing softly. ‘Sh!’ he said, 
his finger on his lips. She stopped singing, whereupon 
he said, ‘Sing again,’’ then reiterated, ‘Sh! Sh!” 
Imitative-Dramatic Plays of the Fourth Year 
Frog and Alligator.— R hopped vigorously on all 
fours to represent a frog; then he became an alligator, 
slowing down his movements considerably. By and 
by he said, ‘‘Here come a frog and an alligator!” 
He himself impersonated both by hopping like a frog 
and pushing a block of wood before him to represent 
the slower movements of an alligator. 
A little child invariably imitates the striking characteristics in 
the things about him. It is the characteristic movements or 
gestures of frogs, alligators, and most other animals that are first . 
imitated in play. 
Washing Clothes.— On the day the laundress 
appeared, R invariably helped himself to soap, water, 
nd a small bathtub, and proceeded to rub out bibs. 
He would play thus for fully fifteen minutes, wringing 
he bibs dry, hanging them up, and washing them 
gain. 
The coming of the laundress merely suggested an enjoyable 
anipulative activity which consisted of vigorous movements in 
imitation of an act connected with the home. 
Automobile. —- Whenever an automobile stopped 
t the house R observed it intently. His first dramat- 
c representation occurred shortly after his third

190 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
    
                                               
      birthday. He sat perched in a fireside chair, his dolls 
arranged in a stiff row back of him. Between his 
knees rested a coffee can used as a steering wheel. 
Soon he was seen to jump out to crank up the machine; 
his little body moved rhythmically up and down as he 
performed this imaginary work. ‘‘Ride in my auto- 
mobile with me, Mother,” he said, in a matter-of-fact 
tone which took her acceptance for granted. As she 
climbed into the seat at his side, he jumped out again 
to crank up, then seated himself beside her and turned 
the can around several times to produce the effect of a 
steering wheel. 
This play is typical of a three-year-old child’s conception of 
locomotion in an automobile. The striking features were the 
steering wheel and the cranking up preliminary to starting. His 
native tendency toward sociability demanded that he find someone 
to share the ride with him. 
Santa Claus Plays. — 1. The Christmas spirit had 
lived on into February in this boy’s vivid memory of 
Santa Claus. One day he fastened a waste-paper| 
basket on his back for a pack and implored his mother} 
to lie down and sleep. She complied with his request. 
He watched closely lest she open her eyes while h 
trudged about with his basket of toys, and finall 
deposited his pack at her feet. She jumped up i 
mimic glee and began to examine the toys. ‘‘Here i 
a music box,’’ he said, handing her a paper, feelin: 
not in the least its inadequacy as a music-box. Shi 
cranked up the music box, at the same time singing 
tune, and R stood by entranced. 
The characteristic feature connected with this three-year-old’ 
representation of Santa Claus was his trudging about with a pack of
-P-A-G-E-203
  THE DRAMATIC PLAYS OF ONE CHILD I9I 
toys after the children were “snug in their beds.”” The fact that a 
paper was picked up to represent a music box is characteristic of a 
three-year-old’s ready acceptance of almost any object to represent 
the thing he has in mind. 
2. One day when R was restless, his mother gave 
him the top of a large roaster to play with. It became 
a boat for a while, then a sleigh. Soon she noticed 
that he had filled his sleigh with toys and was pushing 
it toward her. ‘Lie down!’’ he demanded. Quite 
by chance R sat down on the sleigh and conceived 
the idea of driving his load of toys ‘‘o’er the snow.” 
“T want to take my sleigh out-doors!”’ he called out. 
His mother replied, ‘But I can’t have my turkey 
roaster taken out-doors!’”” “It is not a turkey 
roaster,’’ he explained, ‘‘it’s a sleigh!’’ A little later 
he returned to the sleigh and slid over the floor toward 
her. Sing, ‘Clap, clap your hands!’’ he demanded, 
and from that time on he usually asked for this song 
to describe his Santa Claus activities. 
3. Asa substitute for the roaster, R’s mother sug- 
ested that he use his low coaster wagon. R seated 
imself in the front of the wagon with the waste-paper 
asket full of toys on the back of the sleigh, as he had 
een Santa do in ‘‘’ Twas the Night Before Christmas.” 
stocking cap perched on the top of his head gave 
ore feeling for the part, and some reins with sleigh 
ells attached rang merrily in unison with his move- 
ents over the floor. Slapping the reins he urged his 
maginary reindeer on. After joy in the purely 
locomotive features of this play had subsided, he 
sked for the song and the go-to-sleep features again.

  192 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
R’s protest that the turkey roaster was a sleigh is an example 
of the vividness of his imagery. His mind clothed the roaster with 
sleigh-like characteristics such as he had observed in the Santa 
Claus books. The incorporation of a Santa Claus song into the 
play was natural enough. Less action occurred when the song was 
used. Evidently the words describing 
Now swift o’re the snow the tiny reindeer 
Are trotting and bringing old Santa Claus here 
were a satisfactory substitute for the action, for he would often sit 
perfectly still while his mother sang. His interest shifted from 
joy in propelling himself about on the sleigh to pleasure in dramatiz- 
ing Santa’s visit inside the house. 
4. R asked his mother to play Santa Claus with 
him. ‘‘How?’’ she inquired. ‘‘Be Santa Claus,” he 
replied, giving her a street hat. Then he adjusted 
his own stocking cap, strapped a pack over his back, 
and began to strut about. His mother sat on a low 
stool. ‘I want it!’’ he said, trying to push her off 
the stool. “This is my sleigh!”’ she replied. He then! 
seated himself on his low coaster wagon. Presently] 
the mother harnessed a chair to her sleigh, saying to 
R, ‘‘See my reindeer!’’ “I want some!” said R, doin: 
likewise. ‘‘On Dasher! On Prancer!’’ she cried, 
slapping the reins. Presently she loaded her pack. 
did the same. Once in a while she got out of th 
sleigh to leave some toys at the houses. Always 
got out and Icaded these toys back on to his ow 
sleigh. 
This is an example of adult leadership in play. True, it wa 
about the series of dramatic events the child would soon stumbl 
upon, but the initiative came from the mother, not from the child| 
for when she stopped, he started to play something else.

       5. Interest in playing Santa Claus continued high. 
Often when strangers inquired R’s name, he said, 
“T’m Santa Claus!’”” He was indeed Santa Claus a 
good part of the day. Each room in the house had 
certain chimneys for him to climb, certain sleighs or 
packs to use. He not only felt the part of Santa Claus 
continually, but he would not permit the objects he 
used in this play to be interfered with. 
One day someone started to take a chair which he 
had customarily used for a reindeer. R cried out, 
‘Oh, no, don’t! It’s my tiny reindeer.’ In reality, 
e was not using the chair at all, but it was still a 
eindeer to him. 
6. A new picture of Santa Claus driving his rein- 
eer up to the moon made a vivid appeal to R. After 
his whenever he played Santa Claus he was fre- 
uently heard to say, ‘I’m way up in the sky!” 
nother new feature was added when he was told a 
tory about Santa bringing little Philip a velocipede 
ade by the brownies. His mother had put into her 
tory Santa’s words, ‘‘ Everybody asleep!”’ as he neared 
hilip’s house. These new features considerably 
Itered his Santa Claus play. He sat on a pillow 
aded with toys, pushing a carpet-sweeper back and 
rth to represent the movement of reindeer. He was 
eard to say, ‘‘I have to get a velocipede!’’ Going to 
sofa near by, he began to imitate a carpenter at 
ork. ‘I’m making a wheel!’’ he exclaimed. ‘‘ Now 
e velocipede is done,” he added, at the same time 
acing a toy motor truck in his sleigh. ‘Now, 
sh away, dash away, dash away!” he cried, hitting 
he carpet-sweeper with a stick; ‘I’m up in the sky
-P-A-G-E-206
  194 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY | 
now, and I’m never coming down.” Then in a 
moment he said to his mother, ‘‘You be Philip 
asleep!’’ “Everybody asleep!”” he called out; then 
he got back into his sleigh and enacted the drama all 
over again. |    
            
           
    
    
   
    
    
   Here the stuff with which imagination works is seen very clearly. 
The new plot came from experience and from events pictured in 
books. The making of toys had been suggested by the mention of 
the brownies as Santa’s helpers. 
Valentines. — A little girl rang the bell and gave 
a valentine. As soon as R had examined the card, h 
said, “I want to be Betsy and bring valentines.’ 
Evidently the envelope suggested the postman’ 
bag, for he became a postman. Collecting som 
envelopes, he brought his mother several valentine 
on different trips. | 
Here we see the enjoyment of manipulating objects and of enac 
ing the rdle of the postman, and pleasure in physical activity. 
Grocery. R’s mother sat by the fire writin 
Beside her was a delivery man. Taking blocks fro; 
his wagon, he deposited them one by one on the ar. 
of her chair, naming each article. ‘‘Here’s soa) 
sugar, potatoes, prunes,” he would say. Witho 
demanding any codperation in the play, he remov 
the blocks from the arm of the chair to his delive 
wagon and made another trip from the store to h 
mother. | 
Pleasure in physical activity, in imitation, and in manipulati 
explains the enjoyment in this play. 
| 
Writing. — R asked for ink. He was given a bot 
of water. He dipped his pencil in the water
-P-A-G-E-207
THE DRAMATIC PLAYS OF ONE CHILD 195 
wrote several lines. When his mother started to 
write a letter to a friend he said, ‘‘Oh, don’t, I wrote 
her!” 
Imitating an adult activity is the chief pleasure here.    
   
   
                
   
      
      
         Iceman.— R was playing iceman. In order to 
get the effect of a high, heavy wagon he had pulled 
out the top drawer of a chest. This was the ice 
wagon. There he sat in this perilous position in an 
open drawer, with a whip in his hands urging on a 
horse—a kitchen stool harnessed to the drawer. 
Miner. — R had seen pictures of miners working 
underground. He played miner out-of-doors by pick- 
ing with a stick in the snow. Indoors he laid blocks 
on the floor to represent coal. With the small end of 
his gun he picked and hewed the blocks, shoveling 
them into a coal wagon. One day he donned a cap 
land said, ‘“‘I need a lamp on my cap.” 
“Pockets In My Trousers.’’— In one of R’s books 
as a picture of a small boy with hands in his poc:.ets 
nd a hat on the back of his head. A little verse 
escribed the boy’s first trousers. One day R stood 
ith feet astride and gloves dangling from his pockets, 
hat perched on the back of his head. ‘‘I’ve got 
ockets in my trousers!’’ he exclaimed. He con- 
inued to play thus for about ten minutes. 
This is a good example of an imitative-dramatic play of a three- 
ear-old. Here the posture of the small boy had so impressed R 
at he reproduced it dramatically. 
Sailing. — ‘‘I want a boat,’’ said R, and forthwith 
roduced a wheelbarrow to serve as a boat. “Now I 
ed oars,”’ and he placed a board on each side of the
-P-A-G-E-208
  196 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
boat. Sitting in the boat accompanied by his sailor 
doll and toy animals, he dipped the oars in the water, 
with some pretence of regularity. To add zest to th 
play his mother dropped a doll in the water, callingh 
“Help, help!’”? R merely looked at the doll until his 
mother added, “Aren’t you going to help the man 
out?’’ Then R jumped out of the boat and rescued 
the man. “I’m Captain ——,” he said, giving her 
the doll. Captain had taken them for many 
sails in the summer and had lived on in R’s memory. 
“Are you in his sailboat or in a rowboat?” asked his 
mother. ‘The sailboat,’ replied R. ‘‘I see no sail,” 
she commented. Since R seemed unable to produce 
a sail, she made one out of a newspaper and a to 
broom. R now felt the need of a steering wheel, 
In the summer, the working of this wheel had greatl 
interested him. He found a broken pulley and used i 
for steering. ‘‘I turn the wheel to make my boat ge 
fast,’”’ he commented. ‘‘I’ll close the doors so I can’ 
fall out,”” he said, evidently thinking this time of a: 
automobile. ‘I turn the sail this way. I go thi ” way,’’ said R, moving the sail to one side.    
       
              
    
       
    
         
The confusion of imagery noticed in this play is characteristi 
of a three-year-old. He can hold no set of images in his mind for 
long time, and rides in a boat one minute and in an automobile th 
next. In looking at a boat or an automobile he observes only stril 
ing things such as sails or wheels, and has little knowledge of the 
real uses. 
The boat play continued for some time. R g 
completely felt the part of the captain that whi 
interest in this play lasted he requested his mother 
say ‘Captain ” whenever she called him.  
-P-A-G-E-209
THE DRAMATIC PLAYS OF ONE CHILD 197 
Woodpecker. — R noticed a picture of a woodpecker 
boring a hole in a tree. One day he played he was a 
woodpecker and pecked at a stool. His mother asked, 
“What does a woodpecker use for pecking?’ R 
pointed to his mouth, saying, “His bill.’’ Evidently 
he felt the inadequacy of his mouth as a bill, for he 
soon appeared with a clothespin in his mouth and 
proceeded to peck the chair with the clothespin. As 
very often happened with R in his dramatizations, his 
interest was sustained over night. When he awaken- 
ed the next morning, he said, ‘‘I’m a woodpecker!” 
Climbing out of bed he ran for the clothespin and 
began to peck at the chair and stools. ‘‘What does 
the woodpecker do when he pecks?” he asked.» His 
mother replied, ‘‘Dig food from the tree.” R 
sked, ‘‘Does he talk?’’ She answered, ‘‘Soon the 
birds will return and you’ll hear them chattering and 
inging.”’ In a moment his interest flitted away 
rom the thing he was playing; ‘I’m not a wood- 
ecker now; I’m a miner,’’ he commented. 
Restaurant.— In one of R’s books there was a 
icture of a little girl getting into an elevator. The 
ccompanying story related the little girl’s experiences 
a store, where, accompanied by her father, she was 
ermitted to purchase a dress and to lunch in the store 
lestaurant. After hearing the story, R said, ‘‘Where 
a tray?’’ He carried a tray to his toy closet and 
rranged carefully upon it a varied assortment of 
ishes. Returning with the tray he fed his Teddy 
lear. Then, turning to his mother, he said, ‘‘Do you 
ant lamb chop and baked potato?” It afforded 
m considerable pleasure to see her eat. Soon he

  198 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
said, ‘‘I’ll get you some ice cream and cake.”’ After 
serving her with dessert, he said, ‘‘ Now eat your ice 
cream and jelly cake.” 
Having disposed of the meal in the restaurant, R 
turned a stool upside down to represent an elevator; 
sitting on a low stool beside it, he said, ‘‘ Down, down, 
down,” or ‘Up, up, up.’’ To his mother he said, 
“You ride!” She managed to get within the narrow 
compass of the elevator and was given his Teddy bear 
to hold. Later she showed him how to make an 
elevator door which would slide open and shut. | 
        
   
   
    
        
   
   
   
    It is an interesting fact that the little girl dining with her fathe 
was permitted to eat only the articles of diet prescribed for R’s ow 
noonday meal. The admonition to his mother, ‘“‘Now eat your ice 
cream and jelly cake!” was given in the same solicitous tone with 
which she urged him to eat his food. 
The Little King.— Someone must have told R 
about a little king, for all during breakfast he made 
remarks like these: ‘‘ Does a little king eat this way?’” 
“Does he like oatmeal?’’ Later he played he was 
little king and donned a hat for a crown. 
His idea of kingship did not extend beyond th 
crown. 
This play grew out of the natural tendency to dramati: 
anything that interests forthemoment. The story did rot becom« 
a permanent part of R’s story repertoire. 
Popping Corn. — With much interest R watche 
his mother pop corn in a skillet. Then he said, “T’ 
going to get me a popper.’”’ He returned with a pai 
containing a few blocks to represent pop corn. Covel 
ing the pan he shook it back and forth on the floor i 
imitation of corn-popping.
-P-A-G-E-211
  THE DRAMATIC PLAYS OF ONE CHILD 199 
Susie and Danny. — One day R came to his mother, 
saying, ‘I’m a little girl.”’ Entering into his playful 
mood, she replied, ‘‘ Yes, little Susie.” From that time 
on he was Susie. At night his mother chanced to 
open a magazine on the page of which was a picture 
of a boy and girl under an umbrella. She made up a 
little story about Susie and Danny going to school in 
the rain. R was fascinated with the picture and 
asked her to repeat the story again and again. When 
he was undressed for bed he told his mother that he 
was Susie going to bed and asked her to put Danny to 
bed. In the morning when she entered his room, he 
said, ‘‘Call Susie,” then added, ‘‘Take Danny out of 
bed!”’ All day it was ‘‘Susie this’’ and “Susie that.” 
If his mother called him by his own name, he cor- 
rected her. 
           
      
     
        
     
      
    
       This imaginative play lasted several days. Finally R’s mother 
began to feel that her recognition of the Susie personality as her 
hild was interfering with her personal relations with R. So she 
aid, “I have no Susie, you are R. You may have a Susie of your 
wn.” And R did have a Susie as an imaginary companion for 
everal days. 
Train.—1. R’s first train consisted of a washboard, a 
ocking chair, a dump cart, and a procession of other 
bjects. He invited his mother to ride in his train 
nd then volunteered to be a big black porter. The 
ig black porter said to the mother, “It is time for 
ou to go to bed.” She suggested that the big black 
orter make up the beds. Of his own initiative he 
vered her up with a bib, saying, ‘‘Here is a blanket.” 
ater he fetched a throw from the sofa. By and by 
e sat up in bed to see the sights from the window.

   He came to her and said, “‘I’ll shut the window!”’ He 
hovered constantly near her to see if she was all right. 
R remembered several nights spent on a sleeping car and took 
real pleasure in impersonating the porter, about whom clustered 
many pleasant memories connected with train. } 
2. This train was constructed by. connecting a 
child’s rocker, representing an engine, to a low 
coaster wagon, representing a car. A can was placed 
on the seat of the rocker to serve as a smokestack and 
a box became the engine bell. R made no effort to 
propel the engine. He merely sat within the train 
and enacted a drama in his own mind. He said, 
“Engine go!’’ When his mother approached, he 
cried out, “Big black porter will help you in!” Yet 
he made no effort to assist her. So she made no 
attempt to get in the train. ‘‘Toot, toot!” she said 
“Make the cars go!” replied R. | 
R’s favorite train plays consisted of propelling something ove: 
the ground, and this play is reported in contrast to the usual type ol 
play a child of pre-kindergarten age delights in. There are time: 
with almost any child when the drama is enacted mentally instea 
of physically. 
Fishing. — R was given a tub of water in which t 
play. He found a: long twig which served as | 
fishing pole. He then placed a spoon, a fork, and 
nailbrush in the water to represent fish and pulle 
them out on the bent twig. He kept saying, “ 
caught a sunfish! I caught a catfish!”’ 
Cat and Dog. — R started to dramatize a story of 
mother cat running away from a dog who constantl 
bothered her little kittens. ‘I’m the little kitten} 
said R, cuddling up to his mother; “tell me to once 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
THE DRAMATIC PLAYS OF ONE CHILD 201 
She became the mother cat warning her kitten to creep 
closer. ‘‘But who will be the dog?’ asked the 
mother. ‘‘Let me be the dog,” said R, whereupon his 
mother fetched a toy bear to represent the kitten. -R 
got down and crawled about simulating a dog barking 
at the kitten. The mother cat hissed and scratched 
at the dog; then, taking her kitten, ran away on all 
fours. This play was repeated several times. 
Here is a characteristic impersonation of animals. R preferred 
being the dog because he had a more interesting part to play. He 
felt a sense of power in being able to frighten the cat. 
Factory. — R said, “‘Let’s build a factory.” He 
made a poor building and had to be assisted to con- 
struct a better one. “‘Let’s have the men go to 
work,” said R; yet he suggested no way in which to 
do so. ‘‘You could use your paper dolls for men,” 
his mother suggested. R looked pleased at the sug- 
gestion. Placing the dolls in an automobile he 
wheeled them to the factory. ‘Now the whistle will 
blow for them to go home!” he said. By and by he 
added a wheel to the factory. ‘‘See the wheel go in 
the factory!’’ he said as he turned it round and 
round. 
This play is a four-year-old’s dramatic description of a factory. 
Not far from R’s home is a furniture factory at which men begin 
and cease work at the blast of a whistle. R had seen pictures of 
machinery and somehow connected wheels with factories. The 
luse of paper dolls as men did not suggest itself to R, because he 
ad not yet reached the stage where he required exact representa- 
ion of facts. He was satisfied to convert blocks of wood into 
iremen. His mother’s suggestion was not of much value, therefore. 
Shadows. — R had frequently heard Stevenson’s 
oem about shadows. He had often noticed his own     
                
    
    
-P-A-G-E-214
    
    202 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
shadow. To-day he held a toy over his head to give 
an elongated effect and played it was a shadow chasing 
him about. 
Picture Show. — After R had been taken to a 
moving-picture theater he built one with his blocks. 
Ushers were stationed at the aisles. ‘‘They have 
flashlights,’’ said R. Musicians sat in front of a 
cardboard box which served as a screen. A colored 
picture book was placed against this box, and the 
leaves turned occasionally to represent changes in 
pictures. Cubes and pillars were used for the con- 
struction of everything in the theater; and cubes were 
seats, while the pillars served as ushers, violins, and 
flashlights. The dramatic play was purely imaginative. 
R merely conversed about the happenings in the 
theater. ‘It’s dark now.’’ ‘‘Here are the flash- 
lights.” ‘More musicians are coming in.’”’ ‘‘Here 
are the pictures.” ‘‘More people are coming in and 
I’m showing them where to sit.’’ ‘I have a flash- 
light; see it!’’ ‘Here is a dog trying to get in.” 
“The door is shut.” ‘The picture is ’most over.” 
“No! I was just fooling.’ ‘I got a flashlight.”      
    
     In the beginning of this play the interest centered in laying out a 
moving-picture house. After that, it changed to interest in the| 
events: the going and coming of people, the showing of pictures, the 
flashing of lights, and the music. The play, then, represents 
union of the dramatic and the constructive interests. 
Airplanes. — As a result of several hours’ effort 
evolved some airplanes which showed the character. 
istic features. Then his interest shifted to dramati 
events. ‘‘Watch the airplane fall down and buri 
up!” “See! the man fell out!’ He deliberatel 
 
-P-A-G-E-215
  
THE DRAMATIC PLAYS OF ONE CHILD 203 
destroyed the airplane as he brought it to the ground, 
pulling it apart to represent its broken condition. 
“Now it’s on fire!’’ A hastily improvised fire engine 
came to the rescue. It was in reality nothing but a 
cardboard box, yet it possessed the requirements of a 
complete fire brigade. In each oval depression of 
an egg container sat a tiny wooden block to represent a 
fireman. The engine was a cylindrical thing, a mere 
tin can, yet it assumed dignity and importance as an 
instrument useful for the boy’s purposes. When the 
position of the burning airplane was reached, the fire- 
men jumped out to extinguish the fire. There were 
so many of them that they surrounded the airplane. 
“Do you know why there are so many firemen?”’ 
asked R; ‘‘I need them to work.’’ Ima flash the trend 
of thought changed. ‘Watch the firecracker shoot!” 
he said, vibrating a rubber band which had formerly 
held the various parts of the airplane together. As 
quickly his thought returned to the fire. ‘‘See! the 
firemen have a net.”     
   
            
    
                         
    This dramatic play was the culmination of interest in building 
airplanes. The easy satisfaction afforded by using oblong blocks 
to represent firemen is characteristic of the use of objects at three 
and four years of age. The essential thing in the play is the flow of 
imagery connected with airplanes and fire engines. 
Blacksmith. — R had never visited a blacksmith’s 
hop, but he had seen pictures of the blacksmith at 
ork, and was familiar with songs and stories de- 
cribing the work of the blacksmith. He built a 
hop out of wooden blocks with an anvil in the center 
f the shop. A man stood beside the anvil. ‘‘See 
is big arm!” said R, pointing to a streak in the
-P-A-G-E-216
  204. SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
wooden block which he had chosen to represent the 
blacksmith. . His mother pretended not to see the 
blacksmith’s arm. ‘‘I’ll cut an arm,”’ R said, and slit 
off a piece of paper, which he added for an arm. 
“The blacksmith needs a hammer,” he said.    
       
                                    
         This fragmentary knowledge of a blacksmitlt is rather character- 
istic of the content of a four-year-old’s mind on a subject of which he 
has only superficial knowledge. 
Warships. — 1. R had become interested in pic- 
tures of warships, and listened eagerly while he was 
told a story of one which was fired upon by a sub- 
marine. He examined the pictures of the small life- 
boats which were launched to hold the crew and 
passengers saved by the enemy before the boat was 
sunk. That day he built a big boat to represent a 
warship and a smaller one to serve as a submarine. 
On the submarine was a tower (a candle), guns 
(spools), and cannon (paper wads). The submarine 
fired cannon at the warship. ‘‘Boat on fire!” cried 
R. ‘See the fire engines put the fire out!’’ Three 
fire engines appeared on the scene to assist the burning 
boat. To an inquiry concerning the probability of 
fire engines being used at sea, R paid no attention. 
He took the crew off the warship and placed them on 
the submarine. 
R felt no sense of incongruity in this representation. Into th 
construction of the plot went the ideas he had concerning boats an 
fires. The content of children’s minds at four years reveals mam 
inadequate bits of information picked up in a hit-or-miss way. 
2. Eight warships were tied loosely together t 
represent a convoy of boats which R had seen pictured 
“In case the Germans come, they are ready t
-P-A-G-E-217
THE DRAMATIC PLAYS OF ONE CHILD 205 
    
                                            
      
    
   fight,” said he. One lone German confronted this 
array of boats. The German fired a shot at the 
boats. ‘‘He broke a boat!’’ said R. “A bad 
German!” 
Here again we see a four-year-old’s confused ideas concerning 
war, and his attempt to picture only the striking features. Boats 
and a German were the forces to be reckoned with. 
Engines. — With his mother’s help, R cut from 
paper the parts of an engine and mounted them on 
cardboard. He then cut the engine free from the 
mount and assembled a train which when completed 
consisted of an engine with bell, whistle, wheels, and 
smokestack, and six cars constructed out of old 
envelopes. ‘‘You forgot to cut a cowcatcher,’’ said 
his mother. The engine underwent repairs and 
emerged with a cowcatcher added to the front. As 
it ran under a bridge the paper train overturned. 
“Fixit!” he said. ‘‘ You are the engineer,” his mother 
replied; ‘‘repair it yourself.”’ ‘I’m going to cut out 
a fireman,” said R, and soon returned with a paper 
fireman. Cutting two slits in a paper car, he inserted 
the fireman in the car, saying, ‘‘This is the one that 
shovels the coal.’’ Then, pointing to a place where 
two other firemen were supposed to stand, he said, 
“These two firemen tell the train where to go.” 
hrowing two blocks on the floor to represent men, 
e exclaimed, ‘“‘See these men tumble! They are 
oing to get run over. We'll catch them on the 
owcatcher.’’ ‘‘Chu-chu-chu,” puffed the train, run- 
ing over the two men. No attempt was made to 
escue these unfortunates. Pointing to another man, 
explained, ‘“‘He is the one who oils the wheels.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-218
    206 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
Then an iron engine appeared. ‘‘Why do engines 
switch on another track?’ he asked. His mother 
explained this tohim. He soon applied the knowledge 
gained. ‘‘This track leads to ,” he said. ‘‘See 
this other track. It leads in a different direction. 
My engine is switching on this track now.” Then his 
imagination led him far afield. ‘‘These men knocked 
over the train! They are naughty men! Two police- 
men are coming to lock them in jail. See the police- 
men taking the men to jail.’’ He carried the two 
men off and whacked them violently over their heads 
with a stick. His mother protested, saying, ‘‘The 
policemen would put them in jail.” He next drama-

   CHAPTER XIV 
THE MEANING AND SIGNIFICANCE OF MOVEMENT 
Movement a Pleasurable and Necessary Accom- 
paniment of Organic Life. — Movement is ‘‘the cry 
of the being to be,” the I AM of the human organism. 
From birth until death, life goes on in terms of move- 
ment. Even in sleep, when the body seems in 
perfect repose, the motor processes of the internal 
organs keep up a rhythmic flow of movements. 
These are reflex and automatic acts, initiated entirely 
within the nervous system; they are not directly 
connected with consciousness. Children’s enjoyment 
of movement is seen in their spontaneous expressions 
of joy in even common forms of motor activity. 
They like to run in the open with the rush of the 
wind against their cheeks; they enjoy the “feel” of 
the water as they wade, swim, or row, and they 
respond to the rhythmic flow of uniform movement 
so exhilarating in group games. When we _ see 
children running, skipping, and dancing, we see 
pleasure in movement. Happy laughter accompanies 
the spinning of tops, rolling of hoops, and throwing of 
balls. The delight of adolescents in sports of all 
kinds, ball, croquet, golf, swimming, and dancing, 
testifies to the continuance of pleasure in movement. 
[Enjoyment in passive motion such as is experienced 
in swiftly moving automobiles and in sailing, and even 
in the more active forms like horseback riding, canoe-

  ing, and rowing lead to commercialized amusements. 
Even old age cherishes its mild satisfaction in such 
motor responses as knitting, rocking, and smoking. 
The Physical Basis of Movement. — It is natural 
for the human organism to move when refreshed, 
finding pleasure and growth in movement; and as 
natural for it to be annoyed when obstacles interfere 
with the direct output of motor energy. This 
pleasure and annoyance are part and parcel of man’s 
original nature; for the physical basis of movement is 
instinctive. From birth on the instinct of physical 
activity shows itself in numerous spontaneous and 
involuntary movements which involve all parts of the 
body. That these movements are unlearned, psy- 
chologists are practically agreed. Fond parents some- 
times speak of:teaching a child to walk. They are 
led to believe that they do so because of the im- 
perfections of the child’s first efforts to walk and the 
gradualness with which walking is established as a 
habit. What the parents really do is to add social 
approval to an act initiated from within and accomp- 
lished by practice. And so with other motor acts of 
children: nature sets the time for the act to appear 
and practice establishes the habit. Without the 
readiness of the nerves to act, teaching accomplishes 
nothing. 7 
A Four-Fold Classification of Movement. — Psy- 
chologists classify the native tendency toward move- 
ment in various ways. The author selects the 
classification of Norsworthy and Whitley,' because it

   affords a practical basis for the consideration of 
movement plays. This classification involves: (1) 
movements of gross bodily control; (2) vocalization; 
(3) visual exploration; (4) manipulation — all of 
which admit of separate classifications of the move- 
ment plays recorded and discussed in succeeding 
chapters. Examples of (1) would be sitting, standing, 
walking, running, stooping, jumping, leaping, and 
crouching; of (2), the babbling of infants and other 
vocal manifestations out of which language is de- 
veloped; of (3), which includes among its many 
phenomena perception of color, form, and brightness, 
also passive enjoyment in watching movement; of (4), 
manipulation with such plastic materials as sand and 
clay. 
Is the Need of General Physical Activity Recog- 
nized? — Although children under ten years of age 
are in almost perpetual motion, little allowance seems 
to be made by parents or by public schools, except in 
the kindergarten, for a progressive use of activity. 
One investigator found that the very young child 
cannot sit motionless more than thirty seconds, nor 
children from five to ten years for more than one 
minute and a half. It is difficult for a young child to 
repress movement, because the nerves which bring on 
movement ripen before those which control and 
inhibit movement. Adults, because their nervous 
ystems are adapted to inhibit movement, find it 
ifficult to understand how much energy children 
onsume if compelled to sit still. So important are 
osture and movement as indicative of nervous 
ondition, that child specialists can read the fatigue or

strength of the nervous system from the gestures, 
movements, and postures of the body. 
Opportunity Should be Supplied for a Rich, Free 
Motor Development. — What society needs is able- 
bodied, physically developed children, yet it has never 
been willing to pay the price for them. Playgrounds 
are far from universally accessible to children; 
kindergartens are supplied for only a favored few and 
many elementary school teachers lack the insight, the 
equipment, and the flexible program which permit a 
proper emphasis on physical welfare. Even could the 
school control entirely the conditions of stimuli, 
other factors not under the direction of the school 
might militate against the development of able-bodied 
children. Heredity and environment are responsible 
for the kind of nerves and muscles with which the 
teacher has to deal. 
Places for Motor Education: Home, Playground, 
School. — However, much can be done through a 
broad motor education in the home, the playground, 
and the school. It is a commonplace to suggest that 
every child needs a rich supply of accurate automa- 
tisms, but not a commonplace to place the responsi- 
bility for acquiring these upon the home until the sixth 
year. The child learns to walk, run, jump, reach, 
grasp, and pull, at home; that is, he gains gross control 
of the large bodily acts involving movements of the 
trunk, large joints, neck, back, hips, shoulders, knees, 
and elbows before he comes in contact with public 
school education. 
The nutrition clinics have done much to help 
provide for child welfare through campaigns enlisting

the support of the home. Much could be done to 
enrich the motor activities of children by a similar 
campaign to promote their play activities in the home. 
The work of community play leaders under the 
direction of the National Playground Association is 
an attempt to accomplish this end through enlisting 
the aid of mothers. Mothers, as the natural con- 
servers and defenders of childhood, should be taught 
the fundamental facts regarding the nervous and 
muscular systems of children. Just a little ele- 
mentary knowledge would do away with the ‘sit 
still’’ menace. Demonstrations of playground games| 
with or without apparatus would also help. 
Household activities afford splendid opportunitie: 
for physical development, if used by parents as pla 
activities. Scrubbing, sweeping, and dishwashin 
are not necessarily irksome tasks to be quickly dis 
patched. Like woodchopping, milking, churning, an 
other common chores of country boys, such activitie 
grow tiresome because of the routine, monotony, an 
repetition which enter into their performance. Wit 
little children these acts often partake of the nature 
play. It is a well-known fact that the same type 
motor energy called into use*by these chores could b 
expended in games and sports with no loss of energ: 
Nay more, the energy used thus brings exhilaratio 
zest, and joy to the performers. 
Every home should have some kind of crude pla 
ground for summer use and indoor apparatus for t 
winter. Twenty or thirty dollars a year spent 
play apparatus proves of more lasting benefit than

    expended on the forms of commercial recreation for 
which the same amount of money is often spent. 
The playground movement has passed through a 
rapid and extensive development, but even at the 
present time few cities provide supervision and 
special teachers for children under ten years of age. 
Sometime, perhaps, we may arrive at a realization of 
the fact that it is more important and also more 
economical to provide for the fundamental needs of 
young children than to do corrective and preventive 
work later on. 
That the primary school still falls far short of mak- 
ing adequate provision for the physical side of child 
development is revealed by the long periods spent at 
the desks, by lack of workshop equipment, and by the 
scarcity of play apparatus in a vast majority of schools. 
If the home and school were to codperate to their 
fullest extent in physical welfare work, many a child 
might be spared the handicap of going through life 
awkward and ill at ease, or lacking those specific 
skills which adapt him to his environment. 
All Motor Education is First Concerned Wit! 
Inherited Tendencies.— The child’s original ten 
dencies to movement come through reflexes, instincts 
and inborn capacities. These inherited tendencies t 
movement are the first concern of teachers of physica 
education. At first, many of the motor acts resultin 
from the ripening of inborn connections seem aimless 
But they are most significant to him who reads i 
terms of movements. He who would understand th 
significance of movement must study the neurolagica 
basis for the automatic, reflex, and instinctive acts| 
 
-P-A-G-E-229
  
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MOVEMENT 217 
The tendency of modern theory is to depart from the 
cataloging of instincts as magic potencies which pro- 
duce certain results in behavior. Instead it recognizes 
that what were formerly considered instincts are 
merely more or less specialized responses to certain 
actual situations, and that educational psychology is 
concerned with finding out the associations between 
actual situations and their corresponding thoughts, 
feelings, and acts. 
Is There a Set Order of Muscular Development? — 
That the fundamental movements dealing with gross 
bodily control are unlearned has been previously 
stated as the consensus of opinion of experts. There 
must, then, be a rough order of development, since 
no movements can appear until the nerves which 
initiate them function. As one authority states in 
substance, these movements must be “blind”? and 
“involuntary’’ before they can be voluntary, for 
control is dependent upon the maturing of connections 
between neurones whose action results in these various 
      
          
   
                        
   
       movements. 
The Doctrine of From Fundamental to Accessory 
Muscles. — It has been generally accepted that the 
ough order of muscular development is from funda- 
ental to accessory. This theory, however, has been 
he subject of much controversy for many years and 
as been variously interpreted. The writer accepts 
hepardson’s theory? that the voluntary purposive

Accessory.

  218 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
control of muscles is from those that are oldest in 
the race to those that are youngest. This theory is 
strengthened by an examination of children’s play. 
Kindergartners were among the first to recognize the 
probability that the order of controlled muscular de- 
velopment is from those muscles that are oldest in the 
race to those that are youngest and to adapt their 
materials and plays and games to its practical appli- 
cation. In all children’s spontaneous play the larger 
muscles are the ones used first and most frequently, 
while the smaller muscles come into action later. And 
as Shepardson has pointed out, when movements are 
voluntary, those involving the smaller muscles re- 
quire more effort than the movements depending upon 
the larger muscles. 
Both Bryan and Hancock have given us some experi- 
mental evidence to prove that within a codrdinated 
series of muscles and their movements the progress 
is from large to small muscles. Bryan’s tests of the 
voluntary control of the muscles of the shoulder- 
finger series in children from six to sixteen years of 
age showed that the shoulder muscles have reached 
the best development and the finger muscles are least 
coérdinated in the sixth year. He found also that the 
finger muscles gain in rapidity and precision of action 
after nine or ten years of age.! Hancock's tests 
emphasized the same findings. This evidence is not

conclusive, because there is no definite period of 
maturing for the shoulder muscles, which develop 
rather uniformly up to the sixteenth year with a 
slightly slower rate than the finger muscles. 
The Practical Application of This Doctrine. — The 
most important practical applications of this theory 
are probably: (1) the need of providing for the spon- 
taneous practice of all bodily movements before 
attempting to bring them under voluntary control, 
and (2) the postponement of movements requiring 
finer coordinations until they can be most economic- 
ally used. In regard to the first point we may say with 
certainty that it is an advantage to allow children to 
use a new series of movements in spontaneous play, 
time and time again, before requiring them to make 
these movements voluntarily. This means an atti- 
tude of watchful waiting on the teacher’s part. Since 
she does not know what anatomical concords are 
present, nor what psychological associations have been 
built up, she must find out by observation what a 
child’s motor associations are and what experiences 
lie back of his motor ideas. In regard to the second 
point, concerning the postponement of movements 
requirthg finer codrdinations until they can best be 
laccomplished, it is well to remember that there is an 
pportune time to teach writing, drawing, clay 
odeling, sewing, and weaving, as well as an oppor- 
une time to teach dancing and swimming. However, 
hat there are exceptions to the rough order of develop- 
ment from fundamental to accessory is borne out by 
he fact that a few precocious children ex'st who at 
n early age perform intricate movements with a

maximum degree of dexterity, and by the fact that 
infants pick up small objects before they can sit up. 
Experimentation Needed to Establish Reliable 
Theories. — Thorndike has pointed out that the best 
attitude that the teacher of children from six to 
twelve years of age can take is to find out, by trying, 
the most economical time to teach the movements she 
wishes the child to learn and to make sure, again by 
rying, that the child’s health is not impaired. He 
believes that whether the acquisition of these move- 
ments will injure the child cannot be foretold by any 
theory about the development of the brain by virtue 
of the inner growth, but must be learned by evidences 
of brain exhaustion.! 
Motor and Psycho-motor Tests as a Guide to Motor 
Development. — Another means of obtaining informa- 
tion in regard to the times in which certain sets of 
muscles have their intensive period of growth is by 
motor and psycho-motor tests on selected groups of 
children. From the motor tests we can find out what 
children’s neuro-muscular, or motor, strength, speed, 
or steadiness is. From the psycho-motor tests we 
can discover children’s capacity for sensory dis- 
crimination and for rapid and accurate intellectual 
analysis, also their power of adaptation to a novel 
situation of considerable complexity.2. The variou: 
standard tests used in clinical laboratories are in:

valuable in determining norms or standards for sane 
and safe procedure. Few tests have been made of 
motor ability having to do with such muscular acts as 
the tossing of balls or rolling of hoops. It would be 
necessary to test several hundred children in order to 
discover at what age these movements occur most 
spontaneously. Moreover, if education is to deal 
with shortening the process of learning in any par- 
ticular skill the tests would have to show essential 
movements necessary in any given skill, so that 
teachers could help in the elimination of useless 
movements. 
Known Facts concerning the Order of Development 
of Muscles and of Movements. — How the different 
parts of the neuro-muscular system grow and mature 
is seen roughly through an examination of facts of 
growth from infancy to maturity. Dearborn’s rec- 
ords of L show that her reflex movements on the first 
day were respiration, sneezing, yawning, grasping 
with the fingers, pursing of the mouth, sucking, 
blinking from touch stimulation, and the inhibition 
of crying through touch stimulation.!. Warner says 
that the child at birth may resent an attempt to 
straighten the flexed elbow. He also points out that 
when an infant of seven days moves his limbs, fingers, 
and toes, the movements are slower and more spon- 
taneous than an adult’s; that they are uncontrolled 
by external stimulation, and are not directly useful to 
the child. 
Progress in Babyhood.— We realize that the 
child’s muscular system evidently craves exercise

  222. SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
sooner than we suspect, for the infant kicks, writhes, 
and wriggles to an astonishing degree. This is not 
surprising, since his muscles comprise approximately 
one fourth the weight of his body. 
The writer has condensed a few facts from Warner’s 
account of the further development of muscular 
movements.! When a child is a month old, move- 
ments appear in the face, first about the mouth, later 
in the forehead. The limbs move with more force and 
begin to effect some mechanical result; that is, an 
object placed in the hand is grasped by the fingers, and 
movements of the elbow carry the object to the 
mouth. When the infant is three months old, we 
observe some control of his movements through the 
senses. The head turns toward a bright light, but the 
hand does not yet move straight toward an object held 
before it. Later the child transfers an object from 
one hand to another; as the muscles grow stronger, he 
holds his head up when the body is supported, and 
moves his eyes about. At the fourth or fifth month 
an object seen or heard brings some control to the 
spontaneous movements. The sight of a ball may 
stop such movements and lead to the turning of the 
head and eyes toward the object. Gradually move- 
ments follow the external agencies of light and 
sound, and special combinations of movements lead to 
voluntary actions. 
In regard to the beginnings of volitional control of 
movements, Vierordt has the following to say: ‘All 
indications point to the arm as first becoming obedient 
to volition, and the sucking movements, too, seem 
1F. Warner: The Study of Children, pp. 41-46.

      early to lose their reflex character. Then follow inten- 
tional movements of the head and neck and some 
groups of face muscles, and finally those of the lower 
limbs, which as late as the sixth month still move in 
the most haphazard manner.””! 
Progress in Early Childhood. — By the time a child 
is three years old he runs and talks and chatters. 
Spontaneous movement continues but action con- 
trolled through the senses is established. The child 
accomplishes the movements necessary for gross 
bodily control with little training. As soon as the 
nerves and muscles of the leg are mature he walks. 
Kor the child possesses by original nature the tendency 
to sit, walk, run, and climb, and will perfect these 
acts through experience. The early movements con- 
nected with these acts become reflex through practice 
and form the basis of the complex actions of adult life. 
We know little about the order of development of the 
muscles of the trunk, arms, and legs, but Tyler says 
that the muscles of the trunk are most advanced at 
birth; that the arms are in advance of the legs, but 
that the latter grow more rapidly during childhood. 
At about four years of age the muscles of the legs begin 
to gain considerably. According to Tyler we are still 
much in the dark as to increase of muscular girth, 
et it seems probable that the girth of the upper leg 
ncreases more rapidly during the first four years, and 
fter this the calf.

  224 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
Because each period of pure muscular growth is 
followed by a craving for exercise, the child walks, 
runs, climbs, tugs, and pulls when the muscles of the 
arms, trunk, and legs crave activity. Besides the 
wide range of spontaneous movements noticeable at 
three years, we observe many acts which are con- 
trolled to a large extent through the senses. The 
power to carry over into action some considerable 
time later the impressions gained previously is 
noticeable before the third year. Every thoughtful 
mother observes with interest the child’s motor re- 
productions of her own acts at some interval after 
her own action. In some way the child has secured 
vivid sensory impressions of her acts and reproduces 
later the striking motor characteristics of her actions. 
Progress in Later Childhood. — Some interesting 
facts concerning muscular development after the sixth 
year have been emphasized by observers and experts 
in childhood education. While the period from seven 
to nine years is in general a period of slow physical 
development, called by some authorities a period of 
regression, by others a period of adjustment, motor 
activity is even greater than before. Muscular 
activity is increasing rapidly and must readapt itself 
to new needs. The muscles tire rapidly and with 
boys especially the strength of the muscles of the 
forearm increases more rapidly than the cross-section| 
of the muscles warrants. Movements of the fingers| 
become more skilled during this period, but it is o 
the whole one of adjustment for the higher moto 
centers. As Johnson says, ‘“‘The interest in moto: 
activity is now shifting, as mentioned above, fro:

        225 
interest in activity to interest in result. * * * 
Details of motor activity are coming into prominence, 
and interest in skill is developing. With the child’s 
consciousness of increasing power and skill awakens 
interest in competition. Therefore he begins to play 
games, that is, to play according to form and rule 
with other children, whereas, before, his play was 
largely free, informal, unorganized activity. The 
child is not yet able to codrdinate his activity with ° 
that of others, and there are as yet no truly codperative 
games. * * * The child’s ambition is often quite 
beyond his skill, but his efforts are worthy of respect 
and encouragement.’ 
Tyler speaks of the relative decrease in muscular 
weight and power during this period and mentions 
that it comes at a time when the muscles are beginning 
to crave strenuous exercise which makes far greater 
demands on the heart than mere rapid growth could 
cause.? 
Tyler’s measurements of muscular girths of arm and 
leg were taken by different observers from different 
roups of individuals and are, as he says, hardly 
omparable. ‘‘The arm grows less rapidly than the 
eg up to about the eighth or ninth year; afterwards 
he reverse is true. The running period is followed by 
ne of greater use of the arms. During these years 
he child’s greatest interest lies in plays calling into 
se the muscles of arms and legs. The accelerations 
increase of girth of arm and leg occur at fourteen

and sixteen in the boy. But at ten the increase is 
usually more rapid than we suspect.’’! 
These facts concerning motor development up to 
the tenth year have their significance in motor educa- 
tion in the home, school, and playground. The play- 
ground affords perhaps the best opportunity to 
improve the child’s readiness to act, quickness of 
movement, accuracy, force, persistence, and ability to 
apply force in proportion to the amount of energy 
required. But since some of the causes of defective 
motor ability are disease, uncleanliness, fatigue, and 
unhygienic conditions, as well as repression, the 
home has a big task before it in building up a strong 
neuro-muscular system. The school must cease its 
old-time policy of repression. Some authorities say 
that less than one-fourth of the child’s school time 
should be spent in the seat. To neglect to provide 
the child with free opportunity to run, jump, slide, 
handle, and investigate during the first ten years of 
his life is to stunt his development. It is poo 
economy to neglect his motor education in an attemp 
to force intellectual growth before the time is ripe fo 
the natural blossoming of the intellectual powers. 
The Question of Method in Movement Plays. 
Some of the best experts upon the question of metho 
have pointed out the utter futility of explaining t 
children how to make certain movements they hav 
never chanced to codrdinate spontaneously. Onl 
after a child has performed a muscular act can h 
understand instructions concerning it. The signi 
cance of this is that the trial and error method mu

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MOVEMENT 227 
largely be used in teaching movements, especially 
with little children, and in the beginning stages of any 
new muscular development, even with adults. The 
best procedure is to get the pupil to attempt some 
movements, experiment a while, and then give sug- 
gestions. If left to experiment alone too long, he is 
in danger of forming bad habits; hence a teacher 
must be on the alert to detect good variations in 
experimentation. Trial and error with emphasis on 
the best variation is the only method which can be 
relied upon to bring permanent improvement in 
movements. Ruger says that improvement in habit 
formation comes through cross-cuts which appear by 
chance, but should get into attentive consciousness 
lat once.! Imitation plays an important part in 
erfecting the movements, but not in initiating them. 
t the proper moment the good teacher calls out, 
‘There! you have the right swimming position!” or 
‘That is the best way to bat!’’, and straightway the 
erformers repeat this chance variation which might 
ave passed unnoticed among many others. Once a 
erformer starts out to acquire skill along a given line, 
e must be left largely to himself, except for some 
light suggestion. A good play leader and a skillful 
oach never fail to follow up improvement with praise 
nd encouragement. Neuman says in substance that 
provement must be a conscious aim of the pupil 
imself; that the arousal of the will to improve is of 
ndamental significance in all mental and bodily

improvement.!. The change in the attainment of 
children is marked when their attention is focused on 
strategic mileposts along the way. 
Progress in Learning Not Continuous.—JIn all 
attempts to modify movement through instruction 
it is necessary to bear in mind that progress is not 
continuous. Growth and improvement are irregular 
and gradual. The child proceeds for a while in a 
condition of mental uncertainty until suddenly almost 
by jumps he arrives at a stage where the desired 
movements become automatic. These periods of no 
progress, or ‘‘plateaus,’’ are considered by Book to be 
due to lengthy periods of ‘‘lapses in attention, relaxa- 
tions of interest and effort,’’ and should be overcome.?

    THE VALUE OF GAMES OF SKILL AND OF PLAY 
APPARATUS IN Moror EDUCATION 
Plays and Games of Skill Differentiated from 
Dramatic Plays. — The significance of dramatic plays 
in motor education has been fully considered in Part I. 
In dramatic plays the muscular exercise furnishes only 
asmall part of the pleasure, while perceptual or imagin- 
ative or constructive interests furnish the larger part. 
In plays and games of skill the chief pleasure derived 
is in voluntary motor achievement. 
In a broad classification such as ‘‘ Movement 
Plays” it is important to discriminate between a 
play and a game. Children run, leap, jump, throw, 
and catch, singly or in pairs, and much of their playful 
experimentation is not guided by rules, but proceeds 
according to chance and interest. Whenever their 
plays are guided by set rules, we have a game as 
distinguished from a play. It is thus seen that 
games of skill may occur with or without apparatus 
and play accessories such as bats, balls, and marbles. 
The Genesis of Games of Skill. — A survey of the 
lassification of games of skill discloses the important 
act that traditional games of skill as well as traditional 
ramatic games reveal customs that have come down 
o us from times when practices were in vogue which 
ad nothing to do with games. Playing at games for 
takes involving life or death to the winner or the 
ossession of the loser’s property is found to be a 
229
-P-A-G-E-242
  
230 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
common custom of peoples in widely different environ- 
ment. The cathedrals, churches, and monastic build- 
ings of the Middle Ages reveal diagrams and plans 
carved on the walls or floors which show that the boys 
of the Middle Ages, and probably the monks and 
shepherds too, indulged in games of skill in which 
diagrams or plans were used. There is evidence to 
show that some of the games of handball are out- 
growths of divination, and that the ball games played 
by two opposite parties with bats and sticks have 
developed from early contests in towns.' All play 
among savages is as close to actual life experience as 
is the case with children. In the ordeal and the 
religious plays, and in the gambling games, there is no 
separation at all. It thus seems evident that games 
of skill as well as dramatic plays were in origin 
directly connected with experience, and became un- 
related only when conventionalized and handed down| 
by one generation to another as traditional games. 
Beginning with simple movement plays character. 
ized by moderate motor activity and little or n 
organization, such as hoop-rolling, tossing and catch 
ing a ball in repetitive fashion, juggling objects on th 
hands and feet, and balancing objects on the head, w 
can trace development in organization up to games i 
which tossing, rolling, and throwing are carried on i 
an undefined group. Usually one person is a chi 
performer while others react to his actions. There i 
often some codperation from others and some soci 
feeling from the participants.

THE VALUE OF GAMES OF SKILL 231 
Progression in the Organization of Games of Skill.— 
Gradually the group action becomes defined. Every- 
one playing does the same thing as the others, either 
simultaneously or successively. And more, each 
person tries not only to repeat the act, but to perform 
it more skillfully than it has previously been done. 
This last type of organization is a real game of skill, 
for each player is training himself by repetition and 
effort to compete satisfactorily with others. The 
method of accomplishing the act has become more 
important than the act itself. Examples of such 
games will be found in the records; they include tossing 
a ball from one to another, throwing at a mark, foot 
races, contests of strength in carrying and lifting, 
arching games, ring toss, and many others. A 
higher type of organization in the games recorded 
involves games in which two undefined groups play 
against each other. Here each player must not only 
govern his own actions by the rules of the games, but 
he must coéperate with others in so doing. Examples 
of such games are found in tug-of-war contests and 
in the various tag games played in pairs. This type 
of organization is about as high a type as we see 
develop in the plays of children under ten years of age. 
Games of Skill Correlated With Intelligence. — 
Miss L. Estelle Appleton,! in a comparative study of 
the play activities of adult savages and civilized 
hildren, finds that advanced types of games of skill 
re entirely lacking among the adult Veddahs; that 
hey are almost wholly so among the Central Austral-

ians; that they are somewhat developed among the 
Yahgans, more developed among the Bushmen, and 
comparatively well developed among the Eskimos. 
She thus draws the conclusion that games of skill 
occur in increasing numbers among the more highly 
civilized tribes. She points out the fact that games 
of skill are really games of practical judgment based 
upon concrete conditions. They are, therefore, direct- 
ly correlated with intelligence. Miss Appleton also 
points out that the general and specialized use of the 
muscles has a much larger place in the life of the 
Eskimo than in the other groups. The Eskimo, like 
civilized children, voluntarily subjects himself to 
muscular drill and exercise. 
Sense Education Through Plays and Games and 
Experimentation on Apparatus. — Rousseau was one 
of the first educators to observe that the senses are 
directly connected with motor activities, with the use 
of the hands and legs. He stated emphatically that 
it is not enough to use the senses in order to train 
them, but that we must learn to judge by their use, 
He placed great stress on the quality of thinking con+ 
nected with sense observation, thus making th 
senses primarily active motor organs. Educators of 
the present day realize that most of this active sens 
experimentation goes on through movement play: 
with or without apparatus. We talk a great dea 
about the important motor tasks a child must accomp; 
lish in early childhood, but we sometimes lose sight o} 
the ways and means he unconsciously adopts (1) t 
accomplish the reflex movements connected with th 
spinal cord; (2) to codrdinate the muscles of th    
                                        
     
    
        
-P-A-G-E-245
   THE VALUE OF GAMES OF SKILL 233 
trunk, shoulders, and legs as a result of the growth of 
the cerebellum; and (3) to mature the motor and 
sensory centers in the cerebrum controlling the 
heavier and finer muscular adjustments. A child 
accomplishes these tasks by games of skill and move- 
ment plays on such apparatus as swings, slides, and 
parallel bars. These movement plays stimulate the 
physical development of the growing body. Many 
plays afford stimulation for the use of the entire body, 
while others affect only specialized motor organs such 
as the hands and legs. The specific skills attained are 
connected with useful life activities such as reaching, 
pulling, grasping, walking, hopping, and climbing. 
The motor tasks set by the children are children’s 
tasks, not adults’. And the situations in which motor 
education goes on are social situations preéminently 
suited for development and education. 
It is Difficult to Separate Plays and Games Involving 
the Muscles of the Whole Body from Those Involving 
only Parts of It. — It would be difficult to separate 
the plays of skill and competition involving the whole 
muscular system from the plays involving parts of it. 
In the first place, only a specialist can know accurately 
just what parts of the neuro-muscular system are 
involved in each play. In the second place, even 
yhere the chief activity may be located in the arms,    
   
       
    
  ands, or limbs, the muscles of the entire body are 
ften tense and are found to be codperating through 
esistance. For example, even the games and con- 
ests demanding specialized muscular control such as 
arbles, juggling, jackstraws, tossing balls, cats’ 
radle, parchesi, bean bags, roller skates, and bicycling

      234 
demand coéperation from other series of muscles than 
those directly involved. The most important thing 
to keep in mind is that it has been established beyond 
question that, when children are left alone to find 
amusement and exercise as their impulses direct, by 
far the greater part of their games involve activity of 
the whole body.! 
Play Apparatus as a Means of Motor Education. — 
The value of play apparatus for children under ten 
years of age is less commonly recognized than the 
benefit to be derived from plays and games. We are 
just beginning to realize that play apparatus affords 
an excellent opportunity for motor education in a 
social environment. Sometimes the child plays aim- 
lessly and the main benefits derived are improved 
circulation and respiration. More often he plays to 
accomplish some objective, such as to slide down the 
slide backward, or to climb high on the parallel 
bar fence. In attaining his ends the body is brought 
into positions and situations that present obstacles, 
and to overcome these obstacles requires as much 
thought involving foresight of consequences, com- 
parison, and judgment as is called into play in solving 
problems in arithmetic or in the study of history and 
geography. 
Practical Judgments Involved in Play with Ap 
paratus. — Many adults lose sight of the fact tha 
the child has consciously to build up the neuro-mus 
cular coérdinations involved in reaching, pulling 
walking, and running. For example, when he learn:

THE VALUE OF GAMES OF SKILL 235 
to walk, his attention is fixed for a while upon the 
details of the movements. Soon the nerve centers 
take over the control of the required movements and 
he is able to make them automatically. He thinks 
only of the end to be attained, which may be some 
object to reach, some place at which to arrive. To 
make the arms and legs move together properly in 
situations required of him is his chief problem for a 
number of years. Motor education centers about the 
acts which make this possible. Play apparatus 
involves such a wide range of muscular activities that 
the child experiences no difficulty in constructing 
plays suitable to his particular needs at a particular 
time. He plays on the slide one way at three years 
and another way at six, because even the intervening 
three years bring marked changes in the needs of his 
rapidly developing body. To those who feel that 
apparatus for play is purposeless, the following ex- 
ample may bring a realization of the type of thinking 
required in bringing about the necessary neuro- 
muscular codrdinations. 
A little boy of five years made his first perilous 
journey down the slide. Clinging to the side railing 
lhe let himself be swept downward by the force of 
ravitation. His little face was all puckered up with 
nxiety, but this expression changed to delight as he 
anded safely on the gymnasium mat with only a 
light shock. Quickly running back he repeated the 
eat over and over again, changing the rapidity of 
is descent by strength of grip. At last he dared to 
ake the journey downward without holding on. 
aving mastered this problem, he began to experi-

ment in other ways. One day he noticed another boy 
sliding downward in a swimming position, without 
touching his hands or feet to the side railing. The 
first time he tried to imitate this act, he failed to get 
the right position, and, not trusting himself, caught 
hold of the side railing several times. After much 
selection of means and ends, a process in which mind 
and muscle worked out the problem, he made the 
descent much as the other boy had made it, then 
repeated the act several times with evident enjoy- 
ment. To a careful observer the thinking process 
involved in these acts was none the less important 
because the end was reached by means of the whole 
body. 
Summary of the Values of Plays and Games of 
Skill and Experimentation with Play Apparatus. — It 
is apparent, then, that both plays and games of skill 
and experimentation with play apparatus bring the 
body into positions and situations presenting obstacles 
the overcoming of which brings progressive control of 
the neuro-muscular system; that the method of 
gaining control involves foresight of consequences, 
and practical judgment; }that these plays afford 
stimulation for the use of the whole body as well as| 
for parts of it; that the specific skills attained are 
connected with useful movements such as reaching, 
pulling, walking, running, and climbing; that th 
situation in which motor education goes on is 
social situation, especially suited for the developmen 
of small children.

MoveMENTs oF Gross BopILy CONTROL: KICKING, 
CREEPING, CLIMBING, WALKING, RUNNING, SKIPPING, 
LEAPING, AND JUMPING PLays 
Movements Preparatory to Creeping and Hitch- 
ing. — This group of movement plays is one of the 
first to develop in early infancy, inasmuch as through 
combinations of kicking, rolling, hitching, creeping, 
and walking the child soon learns to propel himself 
toward coveted objects and places. The infant’s 
spontaneous kicking plays an important part in 
strengthening his muscles of the trunk and limbs for 
the later activities of creeping and walking. Froebel 
points out the part a wise and loving mother can take 
in the motor education of her child by playfuliy 
responding to his spontaneous kicking movements. 
Raising the body and learning to sit upright is usually 
accomplished by the child at about six months. That 
this is a pleasurable achievement is evidenced by the 
signs of exhilaration accompanying its performance. 
Not many months later, a child seated on the floor 
rolls, tips, or hitches toward an object he desires. 
Mrs. Tilley’s records show the development of these 
spontaneous movements. (182d day.) ‘‘This after- 
noon he (the first child) was sitting on the floor, and 
when his plaything rolled away from him, he rolled 
over on his stomach and crept after it.” (199th 
day.) ‘‘The second child, when lying down, rolls 
237

238 SPONTANEOUS AND ‘SUPERVISED PLAY 
vigorously toward an object near by. If sitting up, 
he will reach, topple over, and reach till he gets the 
object.” 
A study of 150 children, males and females equally 
divided, showed that 60 per cent. crept, 30 per cent. 
moved along by hitching, 7 per cent. moved by rolling, 
and 3 per cent. moved by crawling, ‘‘swimming,”’ or 
some other means peculiar to the individual.2 Of the 
development of creeping, the following description by 
Sigismund gives an illuminating account: 
Creeping. — ‘‘It is a treat to watch a creeping child. 
The tiny creature, seated on the floor, longs for some- 
thing beyond his reach; straining to get it he loses his 
balance and falls over. In that position he still 
reaches out his hand, and notices that he is nearer 
the object of his desire, and that a few more such 
forward movements would attain it. Soon he be- 
comes more active, sure, and courageous, and learns to 
maintain his center of gravity on three supports while 
he lifts the fourth member for his next step forward; 
for at first the child raises but one limb at a time, 
though he soon learns to use the right hand and left 
foot together. I have never seen one so use the hand 
and foot on the same side. Sometimes the child 
crawls backward like a crab, even when there is 
nothing before him which he wishes to shun.’’

  MOVEMENTS OF BODILY CONTROL 239 
Hitching. — I once observed closely for a period of 
several days the efforts of one child learning to hitch. 
The child reached out for an object just beyond his 
grasp; failing to get it, he rolled over accidentally and 
found himself in a position to reach the coveted ob- 
ject. A couple of days later, he stretched his arms 
out toward an object and tipped over several times in 
succession, finding himself three feet away from the 
place in which he had started. Ten days after this 
he had acquired a uniform position for these excur- 
sions toward objects; placing both hands together on 
the floor he raised his trunk up and forward, pushing 
in oar-like fashion with his right leg. Soon he had 
acquired considerable skill in scuttling frog-like over 
the floor, often choosing favorite places to journey 
toward, or following the various members of the 
family about. 
Learning to Walk. — With the same child, walking 
was accidentally and mechanically induced when a 
low taboret beside which he was standing slid several 
feet on a waxed floor, pulling him along with it. 
Frightened, but holding on to the taboret, he went 
mechanically through the semblance of walking. A 
few days later he voluntarily took several steps from 
a chair to a near-by table. Walking proper, however, 
appeared quite suddenly and unexpectedly. Standing 
beside a chair R walked confidently across the room, 
crept back to his starting point, and walked across 
again, turning to walk in another direction. Soon he 
was heard walking in the next room. Following, I 
saw him creep back to the window-seat and make 
several futile attempts to cross the room. His entire

being revealed signs of exhilaration and excitement; 
his face was pink and glowing with pride, his arms 
slightly outstretched, and his legs spread far apart 
to aid in balancing his trunk, while his breathing was 
rapid and slightly labored. The following day he

started the same experimentation in the same room, 
going over and over the identical course where he had 
achieved a victory the preceding day.' 
Walking a Mechanical Problem Until the Third 
Year. — Walking remains a mechanical problem until 
1 From the author’s unpublished records. 
 
-P-A-G-E-253
  MOVEMENTS OF BODILY CONTROL 241 
about the third year. Until the seventh year the 
torso is heavy in proportion to the legs; because of 
this the legs tire from supporting it. The child quite 
unconsciously throws himself down flat and rolls and 
tumbles about, recuperating for further effort. 
The Parallel Bar Fence.— To protect the child 
from undue strain, Montessori advocates the use of 
several pieces of apparatus, the spontaneous use of 
which exercises the limbs while allowing some support 
of the weight of the torso to fall upon the arms. One 
of these pieces of apparatus, a parallel bar fence, 
deserves special mention in connection with walking 
plays. The writer has tried an adaptation of this 
fence with good results. It consists of two hardwood 
poles, eight feet long, which fit into a series of holes 
in two upright posts supported by a heavy base four 
inches wide. Little tots walk sideways along this base 
while clinging to the pole above. In this way they 
exercise the muscles of the legs, trunk, and arms, 
without throwing the entire weight of the torso on the 
legs, where constant strain of this kind should be 
avoided. The older children enjoy performing feats 
on the upper bars over a gymnasium mat and use it in 
games of skill and dramatic games which they invent. 
Walking Boards.— To meet children’s tendency 
to walk on curbings, fences, and, in unguarded 
moments, along precipices or railroad tracks, several 
ypes of walking boards were introduced into the 
ittsburgh playrooms and playgrounds for small 
hildren. For children under four years, the boards 
sed were twelve feet long and five inches wide. 
hey were elevated from the floor by three-inch blocks

    nailed securely underneath. Narrower boards, more 
highly elevated, were used for children up to seven 
years old, while joists were found suitable for the use 
of children above seven years. 
Walking on Stilts, Snow Shoes, or Skis. — Any 
careful student of spontaneous play can observe a large 
number of walking plays in which children invent 
mechanical obstacles to add zest to walking. One 
small boy when only two years of age delighted to 
strut about in his father’s bath slippers. At another 
time he was seen paddling about with his feet encased 
in coffee cans. After watching boys ski, he was 
observed to slide about on some smooth boards with 
considerable enjoyment. He soon acquired skill in 
skating on these boards without losing the hold of his 
feet on the boards. Walking on stilts is an experience 
every boy or girl enjoys sometime during childhood. 
With the increased height stilts afford it is pleasant 
to strut about, reveling in the power to control the 
new instrument of locomotion. Walking on snow- 
shoes and skiing are delightful sports in childhood; 
and justly so, for to exhilaration from the effort of 
movement is added pleasure in swift gliding motion. 
Hopping and Skipping are Natural Variations of 
Walking Plays. — Hopping and skipping are as much 
a part of the walking plays of children as leaping and| 
galloping are native to young animals. The write 
has seen children, just learning to walk, take a sudden 
leap or several running steps. It is almost as if fo 
sheer joy of living their bodies bounded forward an 
upward. In these movements the body is suspende 
in the air for an instant. In the skipping and hoppin:
-P-A-G-E-255
MOVEMENTS OF BODILY CONTROL 243 
     
   
             
   
                           
    
    movements so common to children, one foot at a 
time is thrust forward and is sustained by a hop on the 
same foot. Some children find it difficult at first to 
alternate the feet in skipping, and drag one foot back 
of the one they thrust forward. The skip gives us 
the beginning of a gallop and the principle of the waltz. 
There are games in which children skip or hop to 
accomplish some end, such as in Skip Tag or Hop 
Scotch. A few games demand a forfeit if the skip 
step is lost during the performance of some feat. 
Running. — From the second year on, the child 
takes great pleasure in running. Left on his own 
devices out-of-doors, a normal child of two or three 
years spends much of his time running actively about 
from place to place. While these journeys are largely 
induced by curiosity about new sights or sounds, a 
large part of the pleasure results from joy in the 
exercise itself. 
Running Plays and Games. — Running plays and 
games appear just after the time of acceleration in 
growth of the muscles of the legs. The period from 
seven to nine years is regarded by most authorities as 
the time for the greatest interest in running games. 
Boys’ interest in such games continues high and 
reaches its greatest development at the age of ten to 
twelve, while girls’ interest in running games is far 
elow that of boys and declines rapidly after the 
ighth year. When running becomes no longer an 
nd in itself but a means to the accomplishment of an 
nd, we have the beginning of a game of skill. Such 
ames are Puss in the Corner, Follow the Leader,

Black and White, Bull in the Ring, one- and three- 
legged races, and wheelbarrow races. 
Climbing. — Although climbing has been mentioned 
with creeping and jumping plays in connection with 
which it first appears, 
other aspects of it 
deserve special men- 
tion. Groos asserts 
that climbing is prob- 
ably the outcome of 
a special instinct.! 
Thorndike lists climb- 
ing and _ sitting, run- 
ning, stooping, jump- 
ing, leaping, dodging, 
and other movements 
as ones that he 
considers unlearned. ? 
Opinions can be’ cited 
to support the opposite 
view also in the case of 
climbing. It is outside} 
the province of thi 
book to enter into 
discussion of this point 
However, the writer’s observations of children’s spon 
taneous play seem to indicate the unlearnedness of thi 
tendency. Whichever viewpoint we subscribe to, th

       practical considerations as to the place and value 
of climbing in motor education remain of paramount 
significance. We do not need to be culture-epoch 
theorists to believe in the value of climbing to stim- 
ulate good circulation and to improve lung capacity, 
as well as to build up 
the muscles of the trunk 
and limbs. 
Robinson called our 
attention to the fact 
that a newborn infant 
was able to cling by his 
hands, sustaining his 
weight. Even casual 
observers note the way 
a baby in arms climbs 
upon his mother’s SPONTANEOUS CLIMBING 
breast and pulls himself 
up to her lap from the floor. As soon as he learns 
to creep, climbing upon low boxes and upstairs is a 
daily pastime. 
When the time comes in which a boy braves danger 
to climb high trees, or scale low buildings, rocks, and 
cliffs, parents and teachers should know what to 
substitute for these hazardous undertakings. 
Realizing from an exhibition of such adventurous 
climbing that the youth longs for an opportunity to 
measure his strength against something, we may devise 
play apparatus which will call forth from the boy the 
spirit of adventure and desire for prowess. The 
climbing rope affords children under ten years of age 
bundant opportunity to gain skill in climbing and

subjects them to none of the hazards they meet in 
promiscuous climbing on fire-escapes and dangerous 
buildings. A climbing rope may be purchased from 
any dealer in athletic supplies or made by suspending 
a strong rope knotted at the bottom from a strong, 
closed iron hook. The children like to pull them- 
selves up and down the rope and to swing back and 
forth. As they gain power in prehension they try new 
stunts by swinging from the rope to a low trapeze 
which can be placed near by, or by swinging and 
jumping to the ground. Many dramatic games such 
as fireman and life saver are enacted on these two 
pieces of apparatus. 
Boys from eight to ten years of age enjoy playing 
part of the time on the boys’ separate playground 
where teeter ladders and high apparatus permit more 
venturesome climbing and sliding. Many common 
types of climbing apparatus would be too dangerous 
for a small playground for small children. 
Jumping. — Pleasure in jumping comes not only 
from the free and swift movement downward, but 
from a certain glory in achievement. Jumping and 
climbing plays appear almost simultaneously. Chil- 
dren learn to jump in connection with early efforts in 
climbing. 
One child two years old considered jumping from a 
footstool a great achievement. He would run to his 
parents before each jump exclaiming, ‘Dump down, 
dump down!” He also enjoyed jumping downstairs, 
step by step. Soon the window seat was the scene of 
new conquests. He also climbed upon a three-foot 
embankment, then half slid, half jumped, down its

grassy slope. Anyone who observes children’s spon- 
taneous play notes how early competition enters into 
their climbing and jumping activities. ‘‘I can jump 
farther than you!”’ is a common boast. The kinder- 
garten has utilized leaping and running and jumping 
in many of its plays and games. Circus horses leap, 
run, and jump over brooms held higher and higher. 
Trick dogs and ponies perform many familiar opera- 
tions. Later these movements are utilized in rhythms. 
Montessori invented a piece of apparatus adapted 
for the broad jump.' It consists of a low wooden 
platform painted with various lines by means of which 
the distance jumped may be gauged. There is a small 
flight of stairs which may be used in connection with 
the platform, making it possible to practice and to 
measure the high jump. The writer has found the 
adjustable stairs belonging to the playroom slides 
fully as satisfactory as the Montessori apparatus. 
The children mark off distances on the ground and 
derive much pleasure from measuring one another’s 
jumps. The springboard used in gymnasiums can 
be built specially for little children’s play. It should 
be lighter and more flexible and should have a longer 
slope. If it is placed in the middle of the room the 
children run and jump various distances from it on to 
the gymnasium mat. They like also to stand on the 
highest point of the springboard and jump up and 
down. Various dramatic games such as train and life 
savers and boat plays take place on this piece of 
pparatus.

RECORDS OF KICKING, CREEPING, WALKING, SKIP- 
PING, RUNNING, LEAPING, AND JUMPING PLays 
1. Sliding Over the Floor.—In the playroom, 
knotted ropes suspended from the ceiling stimulate 
babies, not yet able to walk, to propel themselves over 
the floor. They hold on to the rope and slide gaily 
back and forth. 
2. Creeping and Pushing Plays. — Creeping or 
hitching, while holding on to chairs which are pushed 
along the floor, is a locomotive play which all babies 
enjoy and one which leads to creeping. Babies also 
creep along the floor while pushing toys on wheels.! 
3. Pushing and Walking Plays. — In the play- 
room, children just learning to walk support part of 
their weight on chairs, go-carts, or wagons and thus 
practise walking. Grasping the ledge of the sand bin 
with their hands, they take first steps along it, often 
pushing the weight of the body along with their arms. 
4. Walking in Water. — In the city playgrounds 
the children derive great pleasure in wading, running, 
and leaping about in the shallow water of the wading- 
pools. The water resists their efforts slightly, thus 
giving them a sense of power which, coupled with the 
exhilaration produced by contact with the water, 
makes wading an agreeable pastime. 
5. Experimentation on the Walking Board or the 
Ledges of the Sand-box. — Little tots straddle th 
board, walking forward and backward, sometime 
racing. \

MOVEMENTS OF BODILY CONTROL 249 
6. Walking on Paths or Chalk Lines. — Walking 
contests take place on the chalk lines of the tennis 
court. The children collect blocks or stones and 
arrange them in straight or circular paths, sometimes 
in concentric circles. They walk cautiously on these 
paths of blocks, endeavoring not to make a misstep. 
Some children invent paths showing contrasts of long 
and short steps on which they play leaping and 
running games. 
7. Walking Races. — Children from seven to nine 
years of age enjoy walking and running contests in 
which they race for goals, carrying empty buckets on 
their heads or pushing wheelbarrows. They also 
enjoy potato races, three-legged races, and flag relay 
races. 
8. Running Games. — Children from two and a 
half to four years old enjoy such simple running games 
as Hill Dill, Tag, and Pussy Wants a Corner. Chil- 
dren of kindergarten age enjoy more complex running 
games, examples of which are Ruth and Jacob, Skip- 
ping or Running Tag, Follow the Leader, and Going to 
Jerusalem. From the seventh to the ninth year the 
running games are especially interesting because of 
problems of skill which they present. Japanese Tag, 
Double Tag, Fox and Chickens, Three Deep, and 
Chariot Race are examples of games involving increas- 
ing problems of skill. 
9. Jumping Plays. — Babies two and a half years 
lold enjoy jumping from boxes or low chairs. Jumping 
soon becomes diversified even with small children. 
in the playground the steps of the slide become the 
cene for various jumping contests. There are the

high jump forward, the long jump forward, the long 
jump backward, and other variations. In spon- 
taneous home play children practice jumping over 
boxes, fences, puddles of water, and logs. On the 
playground they run and jump over piles of blocks or 
a pole held at various heights. They practice also 
jumping on one foot or on both feet, and enjoy the 
squatting and leaping jump. 
1o. Leaping and Jumping Games. — Leap Frog 
and Hop Scotch are familiar examples of this type of 
game. 
11. Climbing Plays. — Climbing upstairs proved 
an engaging occupation the first day it occurred in one 
child’s life, as the following record shows: ‘‘One day 
R climbed up two stairs and, looking slightly fright- 
ened, stepped slowly down, one step at a time. 
Nothing daunted, he repeated the climbing, reaching 
a higher place on the stairs, but tumbling down with 
some force. However, he continued to climb again 
and again, twenty times in all, until by dint of perse- 
verance he reached the top of the stairs. By this time 
he had acquired a method of getting down; seated on 
one step he slid down to the next, falling with a slight 
jar on each step.”” ‘‘During house cleaning, a step- 
ladder offered the boy, then two and a half years old, 
an opportunity to climb and look down on his sur- 
roundings. Joyously he repeated his journey again 
and again, accompanying each trip with the words, 
“’Imb up the ladder!’ ’

remembers distinctly paying a visit to a loggin:

community where it was her delight to walk and run 
along the piles of logs, jumping from log to log and 
climbing as high as she dared. Boys and girls in the 
city climb high fences and walk along them with great 
agility. On the playgrounds, children climb up the 
ladders of the slides, pull themselves up the knotted 
climbing rope, and if allowed in the older girls’ 
playground, pull themselves up on the traveling rings, 
teeter ladder, parallel bars, and other pieces of 
apparatus.

An ANALYSIS OF SELECTED GAMES OF SKILL IN- 
VOLVING KICKING, RUNNING, SKIPPING, LEAPING, 
AND JUMPING MOVEMENTS 
The following games represent only a few of the best 
known games of skill. They are presented rather for 
the purpose of illustrative analysis than as a list to be 
used.! 
1. Iron Gates. — Children in a circle clasp hands 
firmly and resist the efforts of one in the center who 
tries to break through their ‘‘Iron Gates.”” The chief 
enjoyment consists of efforts at resistance. 
2. Cat and Mouse. — A circle is formed and the 
child selected to be the mouse stands within it. 
Another player, the cat, stands outside. The object 
of the game is for the cat to catch the mouse. The 
children in the circle assist the mouse by letting her 
out or in the circle at any time, but the cat is hindered 
as much as possible by the children’s tightly clasped 
hands. The game can be made a more difficult game 
of skill by selecting two slow runners for cats and one 
swift runner for the mouse. The chief interest is in 
making movements of strategy and in codperation, 
force, and agility. 
3. Jump the Shot. — A rope with a bag of shot 
attached to one end is swung under the feet of a circle 
of players by one player who stands in the center of 
the circle, the players jumping as it approaches. 
Whenever a player fails to jump over the rapidly 
moving rope, he is dropped out of the circle. The

Life of Some South Carolina Children,” Pedagogical Seminary,

-P-A-G-E-265
MOVEMENTS OF BODILY CONTROL 253 
center player can vary the game by increasing the 
speed of his movements and by raising the rope higher 
and higher as he swings it. The chief interest is in 
agility in jumping, in surprise, and in rivalry. 
4. Rabbit’s Nest. — Groups of four children form 
rabbits’ nests with an additional child as a rabbit in 
the center of each nest. Two other children are 
selected, one to be an extra rabbit, the other the 
farmer’s dog. Whenever the extra rabbit invades a 
nest the rabbit there is forced to leave and_ find 
another nest. When the rabbit is caught the dog 
becomes a rabbit and the rabbit a dog. This game is 
very popular with children between seven and nine 
years of age. The chief interest is in gaining skill in 
running and chasing, in suspense, and in codperation. 
5. Skip Tag. — One child skips around a circle and 
tags another child’s outstretched hands; the child 
tagged skips after the first child, endeavoring to over- 
take and tag him before he reaches the place of the 
one tagged. The chief interest lies in the activity of 
skipping and the added enjoyment of being chosen. 
6. Dodge Ball. — Half of the players form a large 
circle and the other half stand within it. The players 
forming the circle have a basket ball and try to hit the 
“Dodgers” within. When one is hit he drops out. 
When the last one is hit those in the circle take the 
place of the ‘“Dodgers.’’ The chief interest is in 
gaining skill and agility in throwing and dodging and 
in rivalry and competition. 
7. Walking to Jerusalem. — Chairs are placed ina 
row facing alternately right and left, the number of 
chairs being one less than the number of children. All
-P-A-G-E-266
  
254 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
the children march around until the music stops; then 
they try to get a seat. One is left out each time, and 
must stop playing, and remove a chair. The child 
who succeeds in securing the last seat has ‘‘ walked to 
Jerusalem.”” This game is greatly enjoyed because 
of the strategy of walking for the purpose of seizing a 
chair. Suspense and surprise also give point and 
zest to the game. 
8. Goosie, Goosie, Gander.—The geese are placed 
at one goal and a fox at another. After the rhyme 
is repeated the geese leave their base for the other, 
endeavoring not to be caught. The first one caught 
becomes the fox. The chief enjoyment is in chasing 
and running. Enjoyment in rhythmic repetition of 
the rhyme is noticeable, as is the development of 
agility through rivalry. 
9. Pig in the Pen. — One child is a pig in a pen 
made by the other children joining hands around him. 
The pig tries to escape under the hands. The chief 
enjoyment is in physical strength, agility gained in 
opposition, and coéperation. 
io. Wheelbarrow Race.— The racers stand in 
twos at the starting line. One, the wheelbarrow, puts 
his hands on the floor, and the other lifts the wheel- 
barrow’s feet. At the signal ‘‘Go,’’ the teams race 
for an opposite goal. The first crossing the line wins. 
The chief interest is in competition in running; 
emulation, pride in achievement, and coéperation in 
pairs are also important elements. 
11. Pussy Wants a Corner.—Each child has a corner 
except the “kitty.” The ones occupying corners ex- 
change places. Kitty tries to get the corner temporarily

MOVEMENTS OF BODILY CONTROL 255 
       
      
    
     
     
   
   
     
    unoccupied. The child left out becomes “kitty.” 
The chief enjoyment is in running, rivalry, and surprise. 
12. I Spy.— One child, a “‘spyer,” stands at a 
base and closes his eyes while the others run and hide. 
Then the spyer tries to spy the other children, who 
try to return and touch base without being spied. 
The chief enjoyment is in running and chasing, in 
surprise, and in being “it.” 
13. Tag.— One child tags another, and then runs 
to avoid being tagged in return. The chief interest 
is in running and chasing, in agility, and in rivalry. 
14. Wrestling. — The chief enjoyment lies in the 
consciousness of physical strength and in acquiring 
agility through opposition. 
15. .Drop the Handkerchief. — Players stand in a 
circle. One runs behind the others’ backs and sur- 
reptitiously drops a handkerchief behind a child. That 
child picks it up quickly and then chases to his place 
the one dropping it, endeavoring by strategy to get 
there first. The chief interest is in running, surprise, 
strategy, and favoritism. 
16. Baseball. — Played by rule. Chief interest in 
running, unusual activity, dexterity, rivalry, and 
coéperation. 
17. Hop Scotch. — Played on a court marked off in 
rectangular spaces. A block or chip is thrown into the 
spaces in regular order and kicked out by a player who 
ops on one foot. Chief interest is in hopping in this 
nusual fashion, in dexterity, and in rivalry. 
18. Bull in the Ring. — A circle is formed about the 
ull by all the children hand in hand. The bull 
tands in the center and tries to break through the
-P-A-G-E-268
  256 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED. PLAY 
ring. If he is successful, all give chase, the one 
catching him becoming the next bull. Sometimes the 
bull, before attempting to break through, asks of 
each pair holding hands, ‘‘What is this?’’, to which 
various answers are given, as “‘iron,’’ ‘‘silver,” ‘‘gold.”” 
Chief interest is in physical force, running, and chasing. 
19. Leap Frog. — One child stoops and each of the 
others in turn vaults over him. The first one vaulting 
stops and stoops; the third does the same, and so on 
until a row is formed. The first who stooped starts 
the game all over again. Chief interest is in leaping 
and running. 
20. Ruth and Jacob. — Jacob is blindfolded in 
the middle of the ring. He points to someone, who 
becomes Ruth.. ‘Where are you, Ruth?” says Jacob. 
Ruth answers, and guided by her voice he chases her 
until she is caught or time is called. When caught 
and recognized, Ruth becomes Jacob. Chief enjoy- 
ment is in running and chasing, in repeating the words, 
in agility, and in chance. 
21. Hill Dill or Pom Pom, Pull Away. — Children 
stand against a wall ina row or on a line marked on the 
floor, facing another wall or line. One player stands half 
way between the two lines and calls out ‘Hill Dill, come 
over my hill,’’ and the players try to run across to the 
other wall or line. If they reach it without being 
touched they are safe, but all who are tagged remain 
in the center, and as the captain calls out ‘‘Hill Dill” 
they assist in catching the rest of the players. The game 
continues until all are caught, and the first one cap- 
tured is the one to remain in the center next time. Chief 
interest is in running and chasing, and in strategy.

MovEMENTsS OF Gross BopILy CONTROL: SWINGING, 
SLIDING, AND OTHER EFFORTLESS MOVEMENT PLAYS 
Effortless Motion Accompanied by Pleasurable 
Effects in Swinging, Skating, Sliding, and Sailing. — 
That effortless motion is accompanied by pleasurable 
results seems apparent from even a cursory investiga- 
tion into the sports of mankind and the play activities 
of childhood. Peoples of many races enjoy sailing, 
driving, horseback riding, motorcycling, automobiling, 
and aviation, all of which involve a swift gliding or jog- 
ging movement. In most wheeled vehicles, also in boats 
and in airplanes, the forward motion in a lofty seat 
doubtless enhances the pleasure in each new and 
delightful sensation felt. We are agreeably sensitive 
also to changes in the swiftness of the motion, acquir- 
ing such a passion for speeding that racing boats, 
planes, and automobiles have become a commercial 
necessity. While horseback riding and_ bicycling 
partake of the nature of both passive and active 
njoyment in movement, the pleasure experienced is 
istinctly of the passive type. In bicycling as con- 
rasted with walking, we find little or no hindrance to 
wift gliding motion, while in horseback riding the 
orse overcomes most of the mechanical resistance. 
In sailing and in driving a motor boat or automo- 
ile, the satisfaction in movement is doubtless en- 
anced by a sense of power in producing the effect.

  MOVEMENTS OF BODILY CONTROL 259 
Sliding and Swinging the Most Common Forms of 
Passive Movement in Childhood. — With children of 
civilized races as with the peoples of savage or primi- 
tive ancestry, swinging and sliding are the most 
common movement plays. The infant responds 
almost at birth to the soothing effects of rocking in his 
mother’s arms or in the cradle. And what tiny tot 
does not invent some kind of rocking-horse, be it only 
father’s foot or the arm of a chair! What pleasure he 
finds a few years later in swinging on the limb of a tree 
or on the seat of aswing! There is in swinging an ex- 
hilaration and a push of the imagination which enlarges 
the mental as well as the physical horizon. One writer 
goes so far as to say, ‘‘I suspect that there is a specific 
stimulation of the brain-cells that only the swing can 
give, and that the child who has not had this emo- 
tional arousement may be the poorer intellectually all 
the rest of his life.’”! 
What a thrill of delight accompanies a child’s first 
perilous descent down the cellar door or the banisters 
of a staircase! In sliding, the swift downward motion 
brings a thrill of joy heightened perhaps by a sense of 
the hazardous nature of the descent. 
The Use and Value of Swinging Plays in Motor 
ducation. — Skating is one of the oldest and most 
leasurable movement plays in the history of the race. 
ce skating and roller skating are common pastimes 
f children in civilized communities, both urban and 
ural. They appeal to both active and passive 
njoyment of movement. Swings are expensive to 
uy and difficult to install, and bring some hazards.

      260 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
Unless they are set on an elevated piece of land, 
children are frequently knocked down by running in 
front of others who are swinging. There is also some 
danger of the swing frames collapsing unless the iron 
frames are carefully set in cement blocks. However, 
the benefits to be derived cannot be dismissed lightly 
as due to mild emotional stimulus. The child needs 
exercise other than in the erect position. At three 
years his limbs are very short as compared with his 
stature, being about 38 per cent of his height, while 
even at six years they are but 44 per cent. For this 
reason swinging and sliding are of inesttmable value. 
Both activities exercise the legs while relieving them 
of the entire support of the torso. 
Lawn and Hammock Swings. — Babies like to lie 
or swing gently in hammocks. Many playgrounds 
supply hammock swings for babies, in order that the 
“Tittle mothers’’ may play with older children near by. 
For children from two to six years of age, chair swings 
suspended by ropes or chains from a strong wooden or 
steel frame are very satisfactory. Montessori advo- 
cates a wide-seated chair swing which may be set in 
motion by pushing with the feet against a wall. Chair 
swings so suspended that the majority of children can 
swing in them by barely touching their feet to the 
ground provide for more vigorous exercise than the 
wide-seated swings. 
A Single Rope Swing and Trapeze Swing. — The 
orchard swing so common in rural communities find 
its city counterpart in the rope swing commonl 
suspended from trees or unused doorways. Childre 
find the climbing and swinging rope almost as satis

   ‘factory as the seat swing. A low trapeze swing can 
be secured from an athletic supply house or trade 
from an old broom handle and a strong rope. This 
piece of apparatus can well be combined with the 
swinging rope, since many games can be played by 
swinging from one to another. 
The Giant Stride.— The writer remembers the 
great delight she experienced as a child when swinging 
on a revolving clothes-rack in a neighbor’s back yard. 
This device consisted of a large wheel which revolved 
on the top of a wooden pole. In the country it is a 
common practice for youthful experimenters to mount 
a wagon wheel on a pole and to swing from knotted 
ropes attached to the spokes. The giant stride, as : o is 5 
bought jin an athletic supply house, consists of a tall 
pole about fourteen feet high, to the revolving head of 
which are attached six ropes or chains forming ladders. 
The children hold on to the different rungs of the 
ladders and run about the pole, swinging on the rope 
and touching their feet to the ground every five or six 
yards. This piece of apparatus does not belong on a 
small children’s playground. For children to play 
safely upon it they must be taught to jump off and 
dodge quickly out of reach of the other children 
swinging rapidly near by. 
The See-Saw. — The see-saw has proved to be a 
dangerous piece of apparatus. Children have a 
endency to jump off when down, and thus throw 
heir partners off with a thump. They often stand in 
he middle and work the see-saw, falling off or 
ccasioning those at the ends to fall to the ground. 
f see-saws are used in the playground they should
-P-A-G-E-274
  
        
     
     
       
    262 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
have handles and should not be more than two and ° 
one-half feet high. Other see-saws, built still lower, 
will be found useful for the younger children. The 
use of see-saws on the playground demands constant 
care and supervision. The rocking boat is a piece of 
apparatus which, while more expensive to install than 
see-saws, is similar to the see-saw in the motion 
produced and rather more valuable.

Teeter Ladder. — Children enjoy swinging on 
teeter ladder, a piece of apparatus which may bg 
purchased from any athletic supply house. It consistq 
of a horizontal ladder balanced in the middle on ai
-P-A-G-E-275
  MOVEMENTS OF BODILY CONTROL 263 
iron pole. The children take hold of the ends of the 
ladder with their hands and swing as on the see-saw. 
It is not a very safe piece of apparatus, for the children 
tend to jump off at unexpected times and throw their 
opponents down. It is not usually found on a 
children’s playground. 
The Merry-Go-Round. — There are several types of 
merry-go-round. One consists of a circular platform 
on which children sit while other children revolve the 
platform, running along beside it, then jumping on 
while it is in motion. The movement produced is 
capable of making the children dizzy and seasick. 
Even those who push may be affected. Another type 
of merry-go-round is built with wheels and runs 
around an iron track. The children operate it by a 
lever arrangement and derive considerable exercise 
in so doing. 
Sliding Plays: Their Use and Value. — Sliding is 
enjoyed by children chiefly because of the pleasure in 
swift, gliding motion, unchecked by the difficulties 
which usually accompany movement. A baby learn- 
ing to creep derives enjoyment from sliding over a 
lippery floor, pushing chairs and toys about with 
im. ‘‘Before R was two years old he begged to be 
ifted upon a smooth, inclined board from which he 
lid down to the floor again and again. About the 
ame time he derived much pleasure from riding on a 
mall kiddie-car. The sliding motion, coupled with 
he pleasure he found in propelling his own vehicle, 
asily accounts for the enjoyment he experienced.

doors, he soon learned to make good use of it.’ 
Sliding down cellar doors is no longer a common 
pastime with city children. Yet what growing boy or 
girl does not invent some kind of slide! Usually it is 
a smooth board inclined against a fence. The play- 
ground in its early days recognized sliding as a play 
interest and has never ceased to improve upon the 
sliding apparatus. The first slides were planks sup- 
ported in an inclined position by upright poles with 
ladders attached. Pine and cedar planks were soon 
found unsatisfactory and maple was substituted. 
The maple slide comes in three sizes. A kindergarten 
slide should be secured for the use of small children, 
while the ordinary playground slide, fifteen and 
one-half feet long and eight feet wide, is more suitable 
for children over kindergarten age. Where space is 
limited a slide with adjustable incline is an advantage. 
It can be detached from the steps and leaned against 
the wall. An important feature in a slide for little 
children is a series of steps broad enough to prevent 
the child’s falling through, and a slide railing to 
grasp in making the ascent. Many casual observer 
note the long line of children who take turns in the us 
of the slide in the busy hours of a crowded playgroun 
and conclude that the slide is a mere stimulus fo 
relaxation. Others see the value of climbing for th 
muscles of legs and arms, note the apparent relaxatio: 
from strain which follows the sitting position, an 
draw the inference that such play is valuable from th 
physical standpoint only. It is well to remember tha| 
to make the arms. and legs move effectively in earl

childhood is a problem which requires all the thinking 
a child is capable of. Sliding plays present many 
obstacles in which the body must be adjusted to the 
handicap imposed, and in this adjustment reason and 
judgment play an important part. 
The Sliding Pole. — The sliding pole is used in most 
gymnasiums to pass from the second story to the first. 
These poles are placed on the ends of a gymnasium 
frame and are steeper and shorter than the gymnasium 
slide. Boys of ten or over take great pleasure in 
sliding down these poles. The sliding poles are not 
included, however, in the playground equipment for 
children under ten. 
The Kiddie-car. — Before passing on to sled-riding, 
tobogganing, and skiing, it seems best to mention 
again the kiddie-car, a favorite American toy. The 
writer heartily recommends the use of the kiddie-car 
in home and playground. In many cities, where hills 
abound, children use these cars for coasting downhill 
on the side-walk; the three-year-olds guide the car 
by an occasional touch of their feet to the ground; 
the older ones steer with the handle. 
Other Wheeled Vehicles.— The toy market is 
overcrowded with wheeled vehicles which can be 
propelled by pushing, wheeling, rolling, and sliding, 
and by foot movements. Wagons, velocipedes, tri- 
cycles, bicycles, and toy automobiles and airplanes 
on wheels are the delight of city children. They are 
enjoyed not only for the pleasure in rolling and sliding 
motion, but also because of the muscular effort 
necessary to produce motion.  
-P-A-G-E-278
  266 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
Coasting has always been a favorite pastime of both 
city and country children. In many city playgrounds 
there are put up each winter toboggan slides down 
which children slide to. artificial lakes of ice. In 
Pittsburgh, where hills abound, children of many 
neighborhoods do not have to come to the playground 
in winter to coast, as this is the most common home 
and neighborhood sport. 
Skiing. — Skiing is a common sport with children 
in the northern states where the winter brings per- 
petual ice and snow. Little children who cannot 
purchase skis often use home-constructed ones and 
make their own snowshoes. 
Spontaneous Pleasure in Swinging and Sliding 
Toys. — Children derive a certain pleasure in swinging 
balls, tin cans, or other objects attached to strings. 
They like also to swing dumb-bells or weights and to 
move to and fro the various members of the body. 
Some of their pleasure experienced in such plays is 
derived from the repetition and contrast in the 
movements, also from the sense of power in making 
things happen. Many games and folk dances give 
expression to this spontaneous enjoyment of swinging 
rhythms. ‘‘Looby-Loo” is an example of a game 
involving simple swinging movements of the feet, 
arms, and head, while ‘‘Hickory, Dickory, Dock” 
and ‘How Would You Like to Go Up in a Swing?” 
are examples of the use of the more complex swinging 
rhythms in the folk dance. Almost equal to the 
interest in sliding is the child’s interest in pushing toys 
over smooth surfaces and sliding them down inclined 
planes. A visit to the toy shop reveals many games in
-P-A-G-E-279

which marbles slide down a loop-the-loop arrange- 
ment, or a spiral staircase, and many other types in 
which weighted tumblers perform their part on a score 
board or slide down inclined planes and score below. 
RECORDS OF SWINGING AND SLIDING PLAYS 
Swinging Plays 
1. Hammock Swings. — ‘‘Little mothers’’ stand 
in line on the playground to place their charges in 
the hammock swings. Older children play ‘‘sail 
ship”’ in these swings. Sometimes they use brooms 
for oars and play rowing. 
2. Chair Swings.— In chair swings children ex- 
periment with various forms of movement. They 
swing high, low, fast, slowly. They twirl around 
and then unwind, or attempt to swing a certain num- 
ber of times without touching their feet to the ground. 
As these spontaneous variations occurred, the play leader often 
sang appropriate rhythms, thus guiding the spontaneous rhythmic 
movement by a proper musical accompaniment. Children some- 
times row in the chair swings, using the little brooms for oars, and 
throw out a line to catch pretended fish. They play swimming by 
lying flat on the seat, moving their arms or legs in the air. 
3. Swinging on Single Rope Swings With Seats. — 
The children swing two on a seat in standing position, 
working up to considerable speed; they swing various 
ways in sitting position, or whirl gently, twisting and 
untwisting the rope. 
4. Lawn Swings. — In playgrounds where some 
strong lawn swings have been installed the children 
play train, requiring tickets from those desiring to sit
-P-A-G-E-280
268 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
upon the seats, calling out stops, and assisting children 
down the platform when the train stops. 
5. Climbing Rope and Trapeze Swings. — Chil- 
dren play sailor and climb up and down the rope. 
They play fire sliding down the rope as a fire escape. 
Sometimes “‘lifesavers’’ lower themselves from the 
rope to the floor and rescue survivors swimming about 
in the sea. 
Most plays on the climbing rope and trapeze swing are mere plays 
of physical activity. The children try to excel each other in climb- 
ing and swinging high and fast, or in swinging from the trapeze 
swing to the rope and back again. 
6. The See-Saw. — The children experiment in 
swinging high and low, fast and slow. One child 
sometimes stands in the middle and rocks the board 
rapidly up and down.!'| Many dramatic games can 
be played on the see-saw. Boat games are fre- 
quently invented because the rocking movements 
of the see-saws suggest boats. Trains are also dram- 
atized, possibly because slow or fast movement, 
getting off and on, and other features connected with 
trains lend themselves readily to the movements of 
the children on the apparatus. 
7. The Merry-Go-Round. — On this apparatus, 
children experiment in slow and fast movements. 
Sitting securely upon the whirling center-board they 
play they are riding on ocean liners or are driving 
swiftly moving horses. 
8. Swinging Balls and Other Objects. — Children 
like to experiment with balls attached by long strings 
to a horizontal pole. They like to bat the balls back 
1 This is usually prohibited in supervised playgrounds.
-P-A-G-E-281
  
MOVEMENTS OF BODILY CONTROL 269 
and forth to each other and to swing them to and fro. 
Regulating the speed of these moving balls adds 
more zest to the experimentations. This involves 
considerable practice to obtain a high degree of skill. 
It,is more difficult to regulate the speed when move- 
ment is almost imperceptible than when movement is 
at its height. Any group of children invent a variety 
of plays, such as batting a ball to a partner who hits 
it on the rebound, dancing balls up and down, hitting, 
running, and catching balls, twirling and untwirling 
them, swinging balls to represent pendulums or other 
moving objects, and putting the balls through various 
types of rhythm in response to the stimulation of 
instrumental music. 
9. Swinging the Body. — Children like to swing 
the body to represent a rocking-horse, a swing, or 
wind-blown objects such as windmills, trees, flowers, 
or grass. 
Sliding Plays 
1. The Artificial Slide.— Very young children 
sit timidly on the slide and clutch the side railing 
tightly while they slide down. They soon learn to do 
what they see other children do, even to sliding down 
head foremost. 
2. Variations of Play on the Slide. — Boys and 
girls from five to nine years old discovered the follow- 
ing ways of using the slide: sliding down on a block or 
board; sliding down backwards; sliding down on one 
side with arms outstretched in swimming position; 
sliding down in sitting position with arms folded or 
stretched overhead; sliding down while performing

   specified acts with the hands, such as clapping a 
fixed number of times or throwing objects up and 
catching them; starting down on the knees and when 
half way down grasping the side of the slide and 
springing to the sitting position; playing ‘‘tag’’ while 
sliding. 
3. Dramatic Plays on the Slide. — Swimming. 
Train. Birds flying down the slide. Bridge: in this 
play the children hold their hands up to form a bridge 
under which all children must slide. 
4. Sliding Toys.—In the playrooms of Pitts- 
burgh the little children just learning to walk, push 
chairs and doll-cabs about on the oiled floors. Chil- 
dren of creeping age push blocks, engines, and animals 
on wheels with them as they creep. As soon as some 
facility in walking is acquired, children like to pull 
after them toys on wheels, such as wagons, elephants, 
bears, dogs, and rabbits. The smooth gliding motion 
of the wheeled vehicles adds to the pleasure felt in 
controlling the movements of something outside of 
self. Children often incline a board against a table or 
box, and slide blocks or toys on wheels down the in- 
clined plane. They invent various games with weight- 
ed toys called tumblers, counting a certain number of 
points when the tumblers complete a_ successful 
journey to the end of the board or to rings marked on 
the ground. 
5. Skating. — Spontaneous sliding or skating o 
icy streets is a common example of the prevalence o 
sliding play both in childhood and in adult life 
Children sometimes bind on their feet boards slightl 
larger than their shoes, and slide or walk over the ic

on these improvised snowshoes. Roller skating is a 
common pastime with city children. In certain 
sections of our large cities one may walk along streets 
thronged with happy skaters. Some crowded streets 
at certain seasons of the year present the appearance 
of a skating rink.

   MovEMENTs oF Gross BopiLy CoNnTROL: DANCING 
AND SWIMMING 
Both swimming and dancing may be classed as 
active movement plays involving the acquisition of 
skill in their performance. To find the sources of 
pleasure in dancing and in swimming, we must first 
recall the fact that the human organism when re- 
freshed finds pleasure in movement. This fact, how- 
ever, does not account for the peculiar satisfaction 
found in swimming or the fascination and charm the 
dance affords. In swimming, the tonic effect of the 
water upon the skin and its resistance as a medium 
for locomotion, together with enjoyment of the 
rhythmic movements necessary to support the body, 
combine to place this sport in the foremost rank 
of movement plays. Dancing gives us a_ highly 
intensified form of locomotion in which the body 
is put into varied positions suggested by the rhythm. 
We see in dancing almost a complete relaxation from 
tension and a state of physical exhilaration in which 
there is sometimes noticeable complete unconsciousness 
of fatigue together with a sense that the body is of 
feathery lightness. In swimming, there is a relaxa- 
tion of some muscle groups with a corresponding} 
tension in others. 
An Analysis of Adult Dancing. — Proceeding firs 
to a description of the dance, we shall then confin

ourselves to a brief mention of such swimming activi- 
ties as are noticeable among children under ten years 
of age, leaving other and more spontaneous move- 
ment plays in water to be treated in another chapter. 
To the analysis of adult dancing presented by Groos, 
the writer has little to add. Presenting Spencer’s 
view that rhythm is a most suitable instrument for 
the expression of passionate emotion, sad or joyous, 
Groos reinforces Grosse’s criticism that Spencer’s 
theory makes the rhythm of dancing only a strongly 
intensified form of locomotion, and points out that it 
does not in the least explain the pleasurable and 
intoxicating quality of rhythmic motion. As Groos 
says, rhythmic movements are employed among most 
people either as a means of producing ecstatic con- 
ditions as seen in the initiatory rites among savages, 
or as a means of inciting religious ecstasy as practiced 
by the religious sects who roll or dance until a condi- 
tion of intoxication results. He does not overlook the 
use of rhythmic movements in connection with 
fighting or love plays, or their social use in modern 
gymnastic and social dancing. His conclusions point 
out that it is safer to regard dancing as an exciting 
movement-play, which possesses in common with 
other narcotics the magic power of abstracting us 
from commonplace existence and transporting us to a 
self-created world of dreams.!. In speaking of the 
origin of the dance among primitive people, St. 
Johnson says: ‘‘One can almost imagine the Earliest 
Man waking one morning and finding the sun 
shirling, the air bright and cheerful, the birds singing, 
1K. Groos: The Play of Man, pp. 88-91.

  274 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
and everything good to see. And then, through very joy 
of life, he started dancing, and laughing at the plea- 
sure of this new sensation, he would start singing and 
clapping his hands to keep time, and thus there, out in 
the gray wilderness of Ancient Earth, were the two 
great arts of Dancing and Music first brought to life.”’ ! 
St. Johnson’s theory, however, fails to account for the 
spontaneous rocking rhythms which accompany grief 
among many peoples. The Irish ‘‘wake’’ and the rites 
and rituals accompanying the burial of the dead among 
savage tribes reveal the fact that all passionate emotion 
tends to express itself in rhythmic form. 
What is Rhythm? — The fundamental fact about 
rhythm is periodicity or a regular succession of like 
events. When any series of sounds, noises, or move- 
ments is broken up into groups, we have units appear- 
ing in serial form. . It is the feeling for the group as a 
whole which sets rhythm off as distinct from other 
impressions. 
The Origin of Rhythm is Physical. — When we have 
a rhythmic movement we have a rhythmic nerve cur- 
rent. The perception of rhythm comes from the pres- 
ence in consciousness of a wave of kinesthetic sensa- 
tions, due either to movement or tensions of the muscles. 
There seems to be a biological ground for pleasure in 
rhythm. The great pleasure which children find in| 
rhythm is due to the power rhythmic experiences hav 
to set up vibrations within the body and stimulate th 
harmonious activities of the bodily organs. 
The Psychological Basis of Rhythm. — The ten 
dency to make rhythmic movements is instinctiverwit!

children. Their joys and sorrows become externalized 
in rhythmic gestures involving movements of the 
trunk, arms, and legs. Sigismund gives an admirable 
description of the rhythmic movements of a twenty- 
week old infant. ‘If the nurse holds up a child of 
this age on her lap, supporting it under the arm, it 
will dance, hop, and spring perpetually like a hooked 
fish, bound like a grasshopper, draw up his legs like a 
closed pocket-knife, and twist his head and neck — in 
short, he will exhibit the same mercurial exuberance of 
motion which pleases us in young goats, lambs, and 
kittens.” 
Sigismund’s illustration emphasizes the spontaneous 
character of early rhythmic expression. Native ap- 
preciation of rhythm and application of the laws of 
rhythmic progression have a basis in the nervous and 
muscular system. Any movement once started tends 
to recur and to keep recurring. One author explains 
this as follows: ‘‘This tendency to recur follows from 
the fact that the perceptions-reflex of the movement 
itself acts as a stimulus, similar in character to the 
original, toward the repetition of the movement. 
There is, therefore, a tendency for a regularly recur- 
ring series of similar movements to take place, each 
stimulated by the perception-reflex of that which 
precedes it. That this series does not go on indefi- 
nitely as the result of one single stimulus, is due to the 
fact that in the highly complex human nervous 
organism fresh external stimuli are constantly occur- 
ring which interfere with and prevent its development.?

  276 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
The Range of Children’s Dancing. — The walking, 
running, skipping, jumping, leaping, and hopping 
movements of children tend to become rhythmical as 
soon as they become automatic and habitual. Chil- 
dren’s spontaneous dancing includes more than this 
rhythmic repetition of movements. It is the result of 
a mood or idea and as such runs the whole gamut of 
rhythmic expression, including intonations, gestures, 
attitudes, postures, and even song. A close observer 
of the spontaneous dance of emotional children who 
are especially susceptible to music reveals the rare 
transports of joy they experience when responding 
through the dance to the moods and ideas revealed in 
gocd music. It is easy to see that the ecstasies of 
motion transport them into another world, where they 
are content to submerge themselves in ordered and 
repetitive motion. Even the normal child feels at 
times the poetry of motion. With the average child, 
double and quadruple time are easier to interpret 
than triple time. Some children arrive at rhythmic 
perception very slowly, learning first through imita- 
tion and suggestion what other children express 
spontaneously. Interest in rhythmic expression, as 
has been shown, begins as early as the first year and 
declines in the teens. A study of games seems to 
indicate that girls enjoy rhythmic movements more 
than boys. 
Training in Rhythmic Activities. — Many theories 
and systems have been devised to bring about appre- 
ciation and technique of rhythmic expression. Two 
basic methods stand out as extreme views in teaching. 
Both recognize that rhythm is perceptible by both the 
 
-P-A-G-E-289
MOVEMENTS OF BODILY CONTROL 277, 
    
                                              
   aural and the muscular systems. There are those 
who, noticing the ease with which three: and four- 
year-old children respond to music through bodily 
representation of musical values, work for sensibility to 
music, and let the children’s senses, limbs, and mind 
be stimulated to externalize the values expressed in 
the music. Others, while relying upon music to 
supply emotions ; and thoughts, seek first to find points 
of identity between the music and the lives and 
actions of the children. The last mentioned aims to 
catch individual and characteristic modes of expres- 
sion and to improvise music which truly follows and 
embodies that individual or characteristic note. 
Jagues-Dalcroze combines both methods! He claims 
that rhythmic movement can best be acquired by a 
system of physical exercises—a highly flexible system 
adapted to a large variety of temperaments. He 
works for spontaneous representation of individual 
moods and mental attitudes and also for gymnastic 
exercise through exposure to the thought in music. 
Devotees of both methods depend upon the experi- 
mental method for improvement and skill, for recent 
studies concerning the acquisition of muscular skill 
point out that progress comes through this method of 
trial and success. Children must perform a muscular 
ct in order to have a means of understanding sug- 
estions concerning it. But when an improvement 
as been hit upon it should be made conscious and 
ermanent by a teacher who calls attention to it as 
‘ood.

  278 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
Swimming. — Very young children can keep afloat 
in the water. A child of three or four years when 
placed in deep water usually attempts some sort of 
beating movement with his hands and feet. While 
many children learn to swim as early as the fourth 
year, the period from nine to twelve is naturally the 
time when the greatest interest in swimming prevails. 
Studies of play activities of children in various 
localities all unite in assigning to this period the plays 
and games affording the most vigorous activity for the 
whole body. 
Authorities agree that swimming has both physio- 
logical and esthetic value. It is one of the most 
beneficial means of preserving the health. The muscles 
used are of the dominantly fundamental type; and 
the effect of the special swimming codrdinations upon 
circulation, digestion, and the nervous system is 
exceedingly beneficial, Swimming is an esthetic 
asset in that it excels all other forms of exercise in 
variety and grace of movement. It is a physiological 
asset in that it enables the individual to build up 
resistance to disease and offsets the strain city life 
and sedentary occupations bring upon the accessory 
movements and nerves. 
The ability to swim is provided for in the common 
school education of England. Public swimming baths| 
exist in all the large cities, and the children of th 
upper grades, accompanied by their regular teachers, 
go to these baths in the spring and fall. It is a recog 
nized fact that the swimming pool ought to be part o} 
the equipment of every elementary school. No equa 
amount of space devoted to play equipment can per.

   form half the service that the swimming pool renders. 
In the United States the public swimming pools have 
in most cases been connected with the city play- 
grounds. To these public playgrounds, swimming 
pools, and baths thousands of men, women, and’ chil- 
dren flock in the warm summer days; and all through 
the spring and fall the pools are in constant use. 
RECORDS OF AN INFANT’S SPONTANEOUS DANCE 
MOVEMENTS 
9% Months. — R was fretting to-night from teeth- 
ing, when I placed him in his high chair near the piano 
and played to him. His posture and facial expression 
instantly changed. His face brightened and his whole 
body bobbed up and down rhythmically, while at the 
same time his feet hit the footrest at regular rhythmic 
intervals. 
11 Months. — Rocking the chairs is a favorite 
pastime with R. That the muscular exertion oc- 
casions part of the enjoyment is shown from the fact 
that he rocks the heavy chairs most frequently. 
That the repetition and contrast in the movement is 
also a part of his pleasure is evidenced by the fact 
that he follows with his eyes the motion of the chairs. 
R pounds a good deal in repetitive fashion, some- 
times on the floor with his hands, at other times with 
his toys. 
13 Months. — When carried along the floor in erect 
position so that his feet barely touched the floor, R 
moved his feet rapidly and rhythmically as if walking. 
16 Months. —R walked sideways, rapidly, around 
the dining-room table and occasionally stamped.
-P-A-G-E-292
  280 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
When holding on to the table he sometimes stood 
still and stamped rhythmically several times. 
19 Months. — I suspended a red ball from a string. 
R hit it vigorously, watched it swing, then repeated 
the act. 
22 Months. —R was visiting his grandmother’s 
house, where music from a vocalian was played several 
times. Almost at once he began to bob up and down 
rhythmically and with heavy movements of the legs 
to dance about the room, his arms beating time in the 
air. He repeated these movements frequently when- 
ever dance music was played on the vocalian. 
23 Months. —I pointed out some birds; R gave a 
shout of delight as he leaped slightly upwards and 
forwards several times with arms outstretched. 
In this elemental dance we see rhythmic expression in the form 
of pantomime. To appreciate the meaning of the dance it is 
necessary to understand the part that gesture plays in the evolution 
of the race. The appearance of birds sets up rhythmic nerve currents 
within the body and rhythmic movements appear. 
26 Months.— One cold day R was running about on 
the front porch. Accidentally his steps took on a for- 
ward galloping movement. From that time on he gal- 
loped about a good deal as he moved from place to place. 
“Play again”’ is the invariable request after dancing 
about in simple games, such as ‘‘ Here we go ’round the 
sun.’”’ In the boom, boom, boom which follows the 
dance, R jumps up and down vigorously, with keen 
enjoyment. When R was walking around in a ring 
with me I quickened the pace and he danced the 
gallop very rhythmically.!

RECORDS OF SPONTANEOUS DANCE MOVEMENTS 
OBSERVED IN CHILDREN’S PLAYGROUNDS 
1. A group of children from two and a half to six 
years of age were seated on the floor ready to play 
ball when one child started to beat time on the floor 
with her hands. Instantly every child followed her 
example. The play leader improvised simple running 
chords; she played these first slowly, then rapidly, 
changing from loud to soft. Some of the children 
showed instantly a spontaneous appreciation of the 
contrasts in the music; others perceived the contrasts 
largely through imitation of others’ movements. 
2. One day a canary in a cage was brought into a 
playroom. Nearly all the children danced up and 
down in repetitive fashion, some exclaiming ‘‘Ah!’’ 
and clapping their hands. 
Here again we see pleasure in serial form of motion. 
3. A bundle containing several dolls was un- 
wrapped before a group of two- and three-year-old 
children. When the first baby doll was held up, the 
children reached up their arms toward it and bobbed up 
and down in great glee, calling eagerly, ‘‘ Me, me, me!”’ 
4. At Christmas time a group of children were 
taken into an adjoining room where stood a brilliantly 
lighted Christmas tree. Some gazed quietly at the 
spectacle, but the majority jumped up and down, 
merrily exclaiming, ‘“Ah!”’ or ‘‘Oh!”’ 
5. On an outdoor excursion a boy of four dis- 
covered a tiny bud on a bush. He jumped up and 
down and called to the other children saying, ‘‘See! 
see!’’ Another group of children from a slum district 
found some tiny blades of grass, patted the grass

6. In dramatizing the story of the ‘‘Pied Piper of 
Hamelin,” the children walked quickly and excitedly 
when the: rats disappeared, and slowly, almost 
solemnly, when the Piper piped the children away 
from their homes. 
7. In playing Cinderella, the good fairy walked in 
with a slow, dignified tread; the evil fairy limped in, 
and stamped. 
8. The children were sliding on an oiled floor, and, 
quite naturally, threw out their arms every few steps 
to regain balance; the play leader then accompanied 
this spontaneous play with a slide-slide-slide-stop 
rhythm. Later. the children varied this rhythm to 
run-run-run-leap and leap-run-run. 
g. One day the play leader allowed the playground 
rabbit to run about among the children. They chased 
it around gleefully for a minute, then set themselves 
to the task of cleaning the cage. Soon the rabbit, 
left alone, began to leap about on her hind feet. 
It was not long before the children had acquired the 
bunny leap, which they accomplished by shifting the 
weight of the body from their feet to their hands, while 
leaping about on all fours. After this occurrence they 
asked almost every day to play bunny, and, when 
music was supplied, the play took on rhythmic form. 
10. A little bird hopped upon the window sill; 
immediately the children in the playground began t 
hop like birds. A few days later a number of rhythm: 
had developed from this activity, such rhythms a 
run, run, run, hop, hop, and vice versa.

CHAPTER XIX 
MoveEMENtTs OF Gross BopILy CONTROL: THROWING, 
ROLLING, AND SPINNING PLAYS 
Striking and Throwing are Originally Satisfying. — 
The prevalence of throwing plays among peoples of all 
nations seems to indicate to many authorities that 
throwing is at bottom instinctive. Archer thinks that 
throwing stones and hitting with a club are responses 
apart from training.1_ With many primitive peoples 
throwing was a means of killing adversaries and bring- 
ing down game; in fact, like climbing, it was an im- 
portant way of acquiring supremacy qver wild animals 
and inferior races. The fact that the throwing pro- 
pensity persists in full force in an environment which 
ordinarily imposes pain and punishment on many of 
its manifestations, seems to indicate that it is more 
than a mere matter of imitation; in fact, makes it 
seem probable that both striking and throwing are 
originally satisfying. This satisfaction does not nec- 
essarily arise from the fact that both are racially old 
activities, as Archer would have us believe, and hence 
deeply rooted in the brain centers, nerves, and 
muscles concerned with these movements; but from 
the fact that they have a function in maturing the 
muscular system.

Activities of Children Analogous to Those of Primitive Man,”

  284 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
Archer believes that throwing develops from strik- 
ing; that when an object slips accidentally from the 
child’s hand it reveals the possibility of extending 
control over the object by throwing it. Naturally, 
downward throwing occurs first, and forward throwing 
develops soon afterward, while upward throwing 
seems rather difficult to acquire because children 
find difficulty in coérdinating their catching move- 
ments with the course of the descending ball. 
Progressive Development of Throwing and Strik- 
ing Movements. — As early as the sixth month, the 
child shows a tendency to pound with his spoon or 
rattle. At about the same time he begins to drop his 
toys. One child whom the writer observed accident- 
"ally loosened his grasp upon a rubber doll and seemed 
surprised that it had passed from his grasp; then, his 
eyes falling upon the doll, an association was formed 
whereby he connected the act of dropping with a new 
position of the doll which had escaped from his grasp. 
At eight months this same child had developed a 
passion for dropping toys out of his crib. When the 
object dropped or thrown caught accidentally on the 
edge of the crib, he would reach over and attempt to 
push it down. If he succeeded, he would cry out with 
delight; if the effort failed, he would utter a begging 
cry for assistance. At nineteen months, dropping 
pebbles down a steep embankment was a favorite 
pastime. He would shout “gone” or ‘“‘bang’’ as| 
soon as_ he stone left his hands. Picking the stones 
up afterward and throwing them into a pail was decid- 
edly less pleasurable. This was probably due to th 
fact that picking up the stones afterward was play:

  MOVEMENTS OF BODILY CONTROL 285 
fully insisted upon by his mother, hence was not a 
self-initiated activity. At another time, gathering 
stones in a pail became a pleasant pastime. With this 
same child striking by means of a stick was first noticed 
on the occasion of daily walks. Previous to this 
time, however, he had knocked balls about the floor 
with a broom, or rolled them upon the table by hitting 
them with an egg-beater. On one of these walks he 
found a stick and dragged it along the ground, or 
struck it occasionally against a stone wall he was 
passing. From that time on striking at fences, grass, 
and other objects was indulged in freely during the 
daily walks. He would cry out if deprived of the 
stick and would show great satisfaction at the skill he 
acquired in striking grass and weeds a sharp blow. © 
With this child, playfully striking a pet dog was a 
tendency hard to eradicate, while hitting his play- 
mates proved so satisfying that even pain and punish- 
ment failed to eradicate the tendency entirely. The 
following illustration seems to indicate the playful 
nature of this striking propensity. One day in his 
play the child, entirely without provocation, gave 
his playmate a light blow on the hand, laughing as he 
did so. The little girl instinctively drew back and 
cried out, running behind a chair. Quickly the cul-” 
prit sensed a chase; striking both arms in the air as 
he ran, he chased her merrily around the porch from 
place to place. 
Anyone who has played with little children has 
seen numerous instances of their keen enjoyment of 
spontaneous throwing. As Sigismund says, ‘‘All 
children like’to throw and are often blamed for it
-P-A-G-E-298
  
286 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
very unjustly. * * * Weshould rejoice, then, with 
the children when a stone goes a long way or bounds 
into the water with a splash. When children get 
out-of-doors the desire to throw something takes pos- 
session of them; even the yearling picks up pebbles 
and delights to roll them. The older boys stand on 
the coping or carriage block, and are engrossed in 
testing the force and directness of their aim. They 
are trying the power of will over matter.’’! 
That boys are often blamed unjustly for throwing 
seems to be borne out by the following: A group of 
boys in a summer recreation school stood waiting for 
the doors to open, amusing thmselves in the meantime 
by throwing each others’ caps over the high picket 
fence surrounding the school. As soon as the doors 
were opened the boys assumed an eager, expectant 
attitude and went directly to the bowling alley. No 
further transgressions were seen that day. 
Facts about the Striking Propensity. — In writing 
of the striking propensity, Archer presents some 
interesting facts: ‘Many of the boys and girls say 
they carry a stick because they feel safer when walking 
along the street or road. A stick may be used to 
strike at weeds, animals, or even people. It is also 
dragged along a picket fence so as to make a rhythmic 
noise. In riding in a vehicle, one great pleasure is to 
use the whip on the horses. Boys and even girls 
engage in whipping contests, in which two of them 
with whip in hand beat each other until one or the 
other gives up. Driving stock also gives great 
pleasure because the whip can be freely used. Much 
1 Quoted by K. Groos, The Play of Man, p. 104.
-P-A-G-E-299
MOVEMENTS OF BODILY CONTROL 287 
damage is sometimes done in striking flowers, small 
trees, and other plants of value. There seems to be 
an almost blind impulse to perform this motion with 
something in the hand in the shape of a stick or whip.” 
“From the use of the stick and whip the child in the 
course of time learns the use of the lever. This usu- 
ally does not occur until the tenth or twelfth year. 
There is considerable variation here. It is interesting 
that many children do discover this incidentally in 
their play with a stick.’’! Archer also mentions the 
following throwing activities: ‘‘Small children throw 
everything they can get hold of, blocks, toys, spoons, 
knives, forks, food, balls, etc. When larger they 
throw stones, skippers, snowballs, corn cobs, and pieces 
of coal. Stones are used far more than any other object 
in throwing. The returns show that they throw at 
trees, street lamps, birds, horses, wagons, people, 
windows, church steeples, signs on streets, shutters, 
passing trains, brass balls on top of poles, cats, dogs, 
fruit on trees, chickens, and barns. About 40 per cent 
of the boys threw at cats, dogs, and birds.” Does not 
this last fact seem to indicate that a good deal of the 
zest in throwing comes from the desire to make things 
happen, dogs, cats, and birds bringing more startling 
reactions than do houses, lamp posts, and trees? 
Throwing with the Help of a Blow. — There comes 
a time somewhere around the sixth year when the 
boy seeks naturally to hit the ball a blow with his

hand or with an improvised bat. This play is 
usually combined with marksmanship. While chil- 
dren of this age do not play highly involved games of 
marksmanship, they play simplified games of tennis, 
croquet, baseball, and shinny, in which there is either 
hitting at a mark or hitting with some idea of placing. 
In most games of this sort the radius of the arm is 
artificially extended by means of such instrumentali- 
ties as a bat, a racket, mallet, sling, or bow. The leg 
is also used in kicking, another means of increasing the 
sphere of movement, as in football when kicking at a 
goal. Other games involving hitting with the help of 
a blow are polo, billiards, cricket, golf, ping-pong, 
volley ball, and net ball. 
Throwing at a Mark. — Groos believes that with 
primitive people, throwing at a mark originated in 
the hostile use of the ability to throw, and notes the 
fact that these games belong essentially to the male. 
It is an interesting fact that such throwing contests 
still persist in the form of games when conditions no 
longer put a premium on the survival of those posses- 
sing this skill. At the present time there is no 
intimate connection between children’s plays of marks- 
manship and fighting play. 
Aiming Requires Skill and Promotes Concentra- 
tion. — With very young children, simple forward 
throwing is quickly followed by the desire to hit 
something, a house, a tree, animals, or another child. 
The interest in shooting at a mark or goal is not strong 
before the seventh year, although a few kindergarten 
games testify to the beginning of this interest. One 
reason for this interest in aiming, at about the seventh|
-P-A-G-E-301
   
                                      
    
    
      
   MOVEMENTS OF BODILY CONTROL 289 
year, is that the finer muscular adjustments are now 
being correlated) with the rapidly developing brain 
centers, and interest in skill and detail are for the first 
time ends and aims of the child’s motor and ideational 
activity. That marksmanship plays promote a high 
degree of concentration of attention and the capacity 
for swift and accurate reactions is seen by even a casual 
observer. 
Shooting and aiming plays occur spontaneously in 
all playgrounds for small children. A large number 
of indoor games also appeal to this interest. Manu- 
facturers of toys have commercialized the shooting 
and throwing interest in all forms of games, such as 
ring-toss, tenpins, target shooting, faba gaba, etc. 
Indeed, as Joseph Lee says, ‘‘So strong indeed is the 
marksman interest that it threatens, in America at 
least, to absorb the whole play schedule to itself. 
The American youth are just now missile mad. The 
old running games, like ‘Hill Dill,’ ‘Three Deep,’ 
‘Prisoner’s Base’ languish; and everything has to 
be, if not baseball or a modification of it, at least some 
sort of throwing game.’’ ! 
Many Juvenile Offenses are Due to the Throwing 
(Propensity. — The Juvenile Court records of offences 
due to throwing seem to support Mr. Lee’s opinion. 
ne day the writer was riding in a Pullman car 
hrough flat, level country when a stone crashed 
hrough the window at her side and hit the back of a 
an directly opposite. The conductor gave an illumi- 
ating account of a number of accidents of this kind 
hich had occurred in this particular section. The

290 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
accidents had been traced to a group of boys who even 
now were under the probation of the juvenile court. 
The difficulty of eliminating these boys’ throwing 
activities reminded the writer of her own trans- 
gressions in childhood. She remembered gathering 
stones to throw into buckets of water which people were 
accustomed to draw from a well near her home. 
Admonitions from passers-by had little effect. She 
recalled also the scorn with which scoldings about 
snow-balling were received in school. A sling-shot 
was among her early possessions. One day she dared 
a cousin to shoot a stone from his sling-shot at the 
screen door of her home. The cousin accepted the 
dare, and the stone crashing into a piano was a result 
she had little foreseen. The writer also recalls 
vividly the throwing contests held in her early play- 
time. Throwing stones at lamp posts and over low 
fences and buildings and skipping them over the water 
were daily pastimes. 
In all plays with rolling balls pleasure in motion as 
such accounts for the satisfaction afforded. To the 
infant, rolling or shoving balls and other objects is a) 
joy and an end in itself. As soon as the physical 
coérdinations used in aiming movements are built up, 
the child seeks another end, namely a goal. A littl 
later comes the interest in rolling hoops, twirling wheel 
on string, and various activities connected with suc 
play. What adult but remembers the fun of rollin; 
a hoop! Here we find the pleasure in motion com 
bined with a new problem, that of developing skill i 
whipping and balancing a moving object.

From Scotland comes a game called curling, a 
pastime common also in Alaska and Yukon Territory. 
This winter game is played on ice by sliding from one 
mark to another great hemispherical stones with 
handles on top. The object of the sport is to aim 
accurately at a mark, guarding one’s own partner 
while striking off one’s antagonists. 
Both the rolling of hoops and the skipping of stones 
bring a feeling of mastery over the moving object and 
the pleasure increases with the development of skill. 
Skipping stones on water is hardly less pleasurable 
and is a more universal pastime. The writer re- 
members spending long hours, when a child, searching 
for the smoothest, best-shaped stones with which to 
vie with her companions in these skipping contests. 
Tops and marbles have become almost as universal 
playthings as the ball. From the countryside to the 
heart of the city, no boy is found without some form 
lof top to spin, some favorite game of marbles. Lee 
says it is to be regretted that nowadays mere tossing 
f marbles seems to have driven out the more scien- 
ific snapping of the marble. ‘‘Tops,”’ he says, ‘‘reach 
heir greatest popularity when it is a part of the game 
o strike, and if possible to split down the middle your 
dversary’s top by a straight and mighty throw.’ ! 
o illustrate the pleasure children find in spinning 
ops and thus keeping the movements of another 
bject at their mercy, the following is quoted from 
agner’s description of a small boy who liked to 
eep several tops spinning at once: ‘Each had its 
ame, and he talked to them all. The one which

setting them all in violent motion while he ran down 
in the yard. When he came back he rejoiced over 
those that were still spinning.” ! 
RECORD OF THROWING, ROLLING, AND 
SPINNING PLAYS 
1. Simple Throwing 
1. In the baby corner of the playground infants are 
seen dropping spoons, spools, rag dolls, and other 
objects for the joy of seeing the ‘‘little mothers” pick 
them up. Some are tearing newspapers to pieces, 
throwing the fragments about the yard. 
2. In the sand pile little tots are dropping sand 
through their fingers and throwing it as far as they 
can reach. Others are dropping stones into the sand 
buckets. 
3. In one corner of the playground a group of 
small children are throwing rubber balls, then run 
ning after them. One baby is throwing a ball at he 
older sister, who rolls it back for the baby to pursue 
Another small child happens to throw the ball upward 
looks amazed when it is gone, and fails to discover it 
whereabouts. 
4. A little boy is attempting to throw a bal 
upwards and catch it again. At first he loses sight o 
it entirely and misses his catch. After some experi 
mentation he learns to look up after it and reaches ou 
gropingly, his face all puckered up; but so unco| 
érdinated are his movements that he seldom catches i

          5. Older boys are throwing balls upward, trying 
to reach the height of the shelter house. As the balls 
speed upward, the boys bend back their heads and 
follow their courses with their eyes, catching the balls 
with ease and precision. t 
6. Some boys, about nine years old, are playing 
baseball in the modified form of ‘‘Scrub”’ and ‘‘Three 
Ov Cat.” 
7. Bouncing balls while clapping the hands a 
certain number of times between the throw and the 
catch was practiced by a group of girls for several 
weeks until they attained considerable proficiency in 
this art. 
8. “Jacks” is a game in which throwing and catch- 
ing are not the main centers of interest; rather are the 
attention and interest focussed on what is done 
between catches. 
2. Throwing by Means of a Blow or a Stroke. 
1. Babies sitting on a gymnasium mat in the play- 
room kick with their feet against balls suspended from 
the ceiling. At home they kick against their mothers’ 
hands. 
These are perhaps the simplest plays in which hitting by means 
lof a stroke is noticeable. 
2. A group of boys and girls are gathered about a 
suspended basket ball knocking it toward each other 
ith sharp, quick strokes. 
3. Some children sit on the floor playing ‘Hot 
all.” After subjecting the ball to imaginary heat 
hey strike it a sharp blow with the open palm,

sending it across to another child. The ball is kept 
going rapidly in this play. 
4. Two boys are playing a spontaneous game re- 
sembling tennis. Their tennis rackets are oblong 
blocks. They are hitting a rubber ball across a rope 
stretched between two chairs; the child on the other 
side of the rope bats the ball back to the one who 
throws it. 
5. Two girls are playing a ball game with toy 
apparatus consisting of two individual nets for catch- 
ing and a light-weight ball. Placing the ball in the 
hollow of the net they pull the sticks apart and thus 
toss the ball to each other. The child receiving the 
ball in her own net tosses it back to the second child, 
who also attempts to catch it with her net. 
         
   
                 
    
      
   
    Some little tots near by imitate this play; one throws a ball which 
her opponent catches in her apron and then throws back. 
6. Sitting on the floor, some children kick a light 
basket ball back and forth. 
3. Throwing at a Mark 
1. Achild a year and a half old rolled a ball towar 
his mother, missing the mark quite as often as h 
reached it. When he succeeded in rolling the bal 
near her, she gaily rolled it back; when he failed 
she let him creep after it. 
2. A favorite occupation on the playground i 
aiming balls at a tree. When a large circular targe 
is placed on the tree younger children aim at the thre 
outside circles indiscriminately; older ones aim at th 
center with accuracy and precision.
-P-A-G-E-307
  MOVEMENTS OF BODILY CONTROL 295 
3. Several boys and girls between four and six years 
old are taking turns rolling rubber balls at a pyramid 
built of blocks; the one who succeeds in knocking it 
down rebuilds the pyramid and gains another turn. 
4. About twenty children are playing a ball game 
with the play leader; each child has a rubber ball 
which he throws in turn at an open basket; after one 
round, those who succeed in getting the ball into the 
open basket have another turn, and so on until some 
child wins the final honors. 
5.' In the playroom, five boys about six years old 
have propped a table against some chairs to make a 
slide. Down this inclined plane they are rolling a 
ball, endeavoring to knock down a tenpin at the foot 
of the table.     
    
                              
        No score is kept; the activity is an end in itself. One day some 
older boys were found playing a similar game, using the slide as 
an inclined plane and a set of tenpins for the mark. Each boy had 
three turns and kept a score of the number of pins he knocked down. 
6. Ring-toss and quoits are played daily on the 
playgrounds. 
7. A group of boys invented a new throwing game 
by suspending a tin bucket from the shelter house. 
Standing in two lines the members of these teams 
took turns throwing stones into the pail. A score was 
ept and at the end of ten minutes the side having the 
igher score won. 
8. Boys are playing marbles. The six-year-olds 
hoot at anything and use few rules for their play; 
he older ones pick a good shot and play highly 
rganized games.
-P-A-G-E-308
  296 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
g. One day a marble tournament took place on a 
playground. The yard was marked off into courts and 
the boys contested in relays, the finals coming off 
with great spirit. 
10. A group of six boys from seven to ten years old 
invented an interesting marble game; they cut one 
large and two small circular openings in a shoe box, 
propped the box up at the back to form an inclined 
plane, and took turns in aiming three marbles at the 
holes. A score of sixty points was kept; each marble 
that went into the large hole counted five; in the small 
holes, ten. 
       
           
   
             
   
   
    
    Nearly all marble games should be classified as throwing at a 
mark. 
11. Some boys suspended a hoop from the shelter 
house, asked for two basket balls, and lined up on two 
sides. Each time a member of either team suc- 
ceeded in getting a ball through the hoop, a stone was 
dropped into the counting box of that side by the boy 
who made the successful play. No score was kept, 
but when the boys tired of the game they counted 
stones to see which side had won. The play leader 
later introduced the keeping of a written score. 
12. In one playroom boys from eight to ten years} 
of age devised the game of aiming a rubber ball at 
spring bell attached to the wall. The play leader sup 
plied a hoop and bell. After that, several games wer 
invented, the aim of all being to hit the bell a certai 
number of times. One game consisted of throwin: 
the ball over the head when standing with the bac 
toward the bell; another consisted of throwing the bal 
under one leg, aiming at the bell.

MOVEMENTS OF BODILY CONTROL 297 
13. The play leader helped some boys to make a 
wooden target by painting a circular board in three 
concentric circles, red, white, and blue. The hits 
scored were one, two, and three for outer, middle, and 
inner circles respectively. In other playgrounds targets 
were made by pasting squares of red, white, and blue 
paper of three sizes on a square board. 
14. A group of boys, most of them ten years old, 
are playing a game in which the object is to throw one 
ball in the air and hit it with another ball. 
15. Both girls and boys about nine and ten years 
old enjoy throwing a basket ball through hoops 
fastened horizontally to poles. 
16. The following games proved popular in the 
indoor playrooms. Neariy all illustrate the principle 
of rolling or throwing objects through holes: 
Aiming bean bags at an inclined picture board where 
three frogs are sitting. If the bag hits a frog’s head, 
it touches a spring which lets the bag through a 
circular trap door; if not, friction makes the bag 
adhere to the board. 
Shooting toy pistols, with corks attached, at 
pictures of three rabbits seated on stumps. 
Playing faba gaba with a homemade board. 
The marble box game and the hoop and bell game invented by 
children also belong in this class. 
Down and Out. A popular marble game consisting 
of rolling marbles down a spiral tube into holes marked 
with numbers from one to twelve. 
This game is especially popular with girls. Six-year-old children 
enjoy merely rolling the marbles, while children from seven to nine 
years old play for scores.

4. Rolling and Spinning Plays 
1. Babies are rolling balls and creeping after 
them; they are also twirling and bouncing bright 
colored balls attached to strings. 
2. Some babies just old enough to creep are twirl- 
ing small embroidery hoops on the floor. 
3. Little boys sit twirling tops with a rotary hand 
motion. Older ones spin small hoops attached to 
strings. 
4. A two-and-a-half-year-old child, whom the 
writer observed in a home, acquired considerable skill 
in twirling a teething ring on a heavy cord. He would 
beg his father to twirl it even more rapidly and would 
watch the movements with pleasure. 
5. Agroup of three- and four-year-old children are 
sitting on the floor playing ‘‘Roll Over, Come. Back 
Here’’ with a small basket ball. 
6. Both boys and girls are rolling hoops; one boy 
has fitted together two hoops to form a hollow sphere; 
two other children are doing the same thing with four 
hoops. This leads to a new kind of hoop race in which 
the added problem of keeping the hoop-ball intact 
while running and whipping it adds zest to the race. 
7. Some girls are spinning tin pans preparatory to 
playing ‘‘Spin the Platter.” 
8. Boys are twirling small wheels, which have 
come off the wheelbarrows, on strong cord; the object 
is to see who can keep the wheels going longest.

few of the best games are included. The writer’s 
purpose is to show by analysis the important aspects 
of these games; in the analysis the appeal of movement 
will be considered first, followed by brief comment on 
the social and intellectual features.! 
Tossing. —1. Children toss balls together, playing 
individually, yet deriving considerable fun from 
running after the balls, dodging stray balls, and 
sharing achievements. Skill, speed, accuracy, rivalry, 
and display are features of the game. 
2. Balloon Ball.— Children toss a large, light ball 
into the air and bat it upward with the hand until a 
miss is made, or bat it downward, striking each time 
on the upward bounce. Among the developments of 
this game are speed, accuracy of blow, and attempts 
at display. 
3. Children toss or bounce balls to music, using 
simple, accented two-four and four-four time at first, 
later three-four time. There is increasing perception 
of rhythm in relation to accuracy and speed. 
Tossing or Throwing at a Mark.—1. Children 
stand in a circle and toss rubber balls into a large 
basket placed in the center of the circle. The game 
may be varied by tossing sometimes singly, sometimes 
all together. Display, attention, accuracy, and skill 
are involved.

2. A hoop is suspended with bell attached in such a 
way that the bell falls into the center of the hoop. 
The children attempt to hit the bell with a ball or toss 
the ball through the hoop without touching the bell. 
In this game enjoyment of acquiring skill is evident, 
also rivalry and display. 
3. Bean Bags. — Marks are set up or circles are 
drawn on the ground. Bean bags are tossed at the 
marks or into the chalk circles. A score may be kept 
if desired. The chief enjoyment is in the movements 
connected with throwing, in skill, in rivalry, and in 
display. 
4. Straddle Ball.— The players form a circle 
astride, touching the feet of players at each side. 
One player stands in the center and tries to throw a 
basket ball between the feet of any two players or 
between a player’s feet. When he succeeds in doing 
this, the player under whose feet the ball passed or the 
player to whose right the ball passed must exchange 
places with the center player. The chief interest is 
in agility, rivalry, combat, and strategy. 
5. Human Target.— One child becomes a target 
standing in the center of a group of players. The 
others pass a basket ball around among themselves 
and throw it at the center player. When a player 
receives a ball he must throw it from where he stands. 
If in a poor position for a good shot, he can throw the 
ball to someone near the target. A new target 
replaces the center player when he is touched or hit by, 
a ball. The chief interest in this game consists i 
throwing, suspense, strategy, skill, and rivalry.

6. Straddle Ball Relay.— Children are formed 
into two lines, each player standing with feet well 
apart and directly behind the one in front. At the 
sign “‘Go,”’ the first player in each line throws a basket 
ball between his feet and down the line between the 
feet of all the players. The last players in the line 
pick up the balls and run to the head of the lines, 
repeating the throw. When every player in the lines 
has done this, one after the other, the race ends. The 
chief enjoyment is in agility in throwing and running, 
in coéperation, in rivalry in combat, and in suspense. 
7. Bandy-Ball. — An old English game similar to 
golf. Children use “‘bandies,”’ sticks bent and round 
at one end, to drive a small wooden ball to fixed 
points. Accuracy of aim, rivalry, and competition 
enter into this play. 
8. Roll Ball.— A row of holes in the ground is 
assigned to players. One player takes a ball, stands 
off, and tries to roll it into a particular hole. The 
player into whose hole it has rolled seizes the ball and 
throws it at the other players, who scatter to avoid 
being hit. If he succeeds it hitting someone, a stone 
is placed in the hole of that player; if not, the player 
must put a stone in his own hole. Any player 
accumulating five stones is out of the game. Com- 
petition in skill and resistance account for much of 
the pleasure in this game, also a desire to star, rivalry, 
manipulation, and a sense of humor. 
g. Arch Ball. — The children form into two lines. 
The head player in each line throws a basket ball over 
his head into the hands of another player, who has his 
hands in receiving position over his head. This 
 
-P-A-G-E-314
  302 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
player repeats the throw to the one back of him. 
When each player has had a turn, the race ends. 
Agility in throwing and running, codperation, rivalry 
in combat, and suspense make this a popular play. 
Rolling the Ball.— 1. Children sit in a circle and 
roll or bounce the ball back and forth to each other. 
The play is varied by using songs describing the time 
to roll and to send back; or by using balls of different 
size and weight which, because of this variation, 
demand different strength to handle. Interest is in 
being ‘‘it,’’ a sender or a receiver, in skill and accuracy 
of aim, and in manipulation. Where words are used, 
language interest also enters in. 
2. Hot Ball. — The children pretend the ball is 
hot and hit it back and forth in a circle, using a 
quick, sharp blow of the open palm. In this game, 
enjoyment in speed and accuracy of aim is enhanced 
by humor, rivalry, and agility in securing a turn. 
Rolling ata Mark.— 1. Children sit in a circle and 
roll several balls, one at a time, into circles drawn on 
the floor, or roll the balls at towers built of blocks. 
Those who have sufficient accuracy of aim to stop one 
or more balls within the chalk circles, or to hit the 
towers, win another turn. Here’ we see interest in 
skill, rivalry, humor, and display. 
2. Tenpins.— Tenpins are set up and children 
bowl at them with small wooden or hard-rubber balls. 
Scores can be kept if desired. The chief interest is in 
the physical activity of rolling, although some interest 
in competition and display enters in. 
Spinning.— 1. Spin the Platter. Children sit in 
a circle and take turns in spinning a platter. This 
 
-P-A-G-E-315
           
    
   
    
     MOVEMENTS OF BODILY CONTROL 303 
may be varied by using an embroidery hoop, a small 
wheel, or a top. Those who spin longest get another 
turn. The chief interest here is in passive enjoyment 
in motion and in making spinning movements. Skill 
and competitive interest are involved. 
2. Spinning Buttons. — Large buttons are spun 
on a string. Contestants are arranged in pairs. 
Here we see passive enjoyment in contemplating 
motion as well as pleasure in manipulating the string, 
together with love of display and competition in skill.

    CHAPTER XX 
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MANIPULATION AS A PLAY 
ACTIVITY 
What is Manipulation? — A little child, unin- 
fluenced by training, pokes, pulls, scratches, and 
otherwise handles many objects with which he comes 
in contact.\ By manipulation we mean the sum 
total of these movements or any one of the various 
arm, hand, and finger movements made in response 
to objects in the environment. 
What is Its Significance Among Original Ten- 
dencies? — At first sight these instinctive puttering 
movements seem to accomplish little, although they 
appear to have a certain satisfyingness. We have all 
watched the apparently aimless reach-grasp-put-in- 
the-mouth movements of infants, and are familiar 
with the eager fingering of children, who poke and 
maul most objects within their reach. These re- 
sponses are really instinctive, even though they appear 
less definite than some of the other inherited ten- 
dencies. In speaking of the apparently aimless 
appearance of manipulation, visual exploration, and 
vocalization, Thorndike says: ‘‘But a more critical 
consideration of the behavior will show that it is 
conformable to the general type of a connection of a 
definite response with a definite situation, perpetuated | 
in inheritance by its utility.” !

306 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
Manipulation is Pleasurable. — To see, hear, feel, 
and make things happen to materials and objects in 
their environment is the source of real satisfaction to 
children. Sand is to feel, throw, and mold; wood is 
to pound with, to carve, and build into toys; toys are 
to do things with, and are the more satisfactory if 
they can be taken apart and adapted to a never- 
ending variety of uses. Such activities are ends 
in themselves; keen indeed is the pleasure of being a 
cause of the changes and uses of things in the physical 
world. : 
Its Educational Significance. — The aim of finger 
play is knowledge, and all these seemingly indefinite 
hit-and-miss handling movements of infancy and 
childhood are links in the long chain of human experi- 
mentation, necessary as a means of finding out the 
truth about natural forces and materials, essential in 
order that this environment of ours may be: remade 
and adapted to the constantly progressive demands of 
man. 
Manipulation Affords Training in Sense Percep- 
tion. — Practice in handling things gives a greater 
power of discrimination in all departments of sense 
perception. Children acquire the power of attention 
and gain practice in noticing things and their qualities. 
They discriminate between hard and soft, among 
colors, curves, and straight lines. This original 
tendency to manipulate keeps children constantly] 
active where things are concerned. When their} 
movements are maccurate, they are penalized b 
accidents. They learn to feel again, look again 
touch again in order to get clearer reports of object:    
   
    
    
   
            
   
    
    
    
  
-P-A-G-E-319
  
MANIPULATION AS A PLAY ACTIVITY 307 
and to adapt objects to their purposes. A wonderful 
field of sense training is thus the result of a free use of 
manipulation. Such admonitions as ‘‘Don’t touch! 
Don’t handle!”’ run contrary to brain-set and muscle- 
set in childhood. In nine cases out of ten, penalties 
fail to stop destructive acts of manipulation. What 
child does not cut his own hair, riddle clothing with a 
knife, unjoint dolls and animals, break glass to bits, 
bend wire and convert plastic materials into new 
forms and shapes? 
It Affords Social Training. — After the first crude 
handling of infancy has passed into touch experimen- 
tation and construction, manipulating activities de- 
mand a social situation in which to develop. Codp- 
eration is necessary in most manipulative and 
constructive plays of childhood. Children need guid- 
ance and leadership as well as coéperation from other 
children, for impulse and skill are often far apart. 
This necessitates a give-and-take of experience which 
constitutes the principal social gain from constructive 
activities. 
It Affords Economic Training. — As the manipu- 
lative activities of childhood expand into constructive 
work with all kinds of plastic materials, they become 
valuable as ends in themselves. They should not be 
considered as a means of vocational training. The 
chief economic value lies in the habits and attitudes 
formed rather than in the specialized training re- 
ceived. Dewey has shown constructive activities as 
correlation centers in which the child’s social feelings 
are tied up with economic and industrial needs and 
processes. One of the chief causes of industrial unrest
-P-A-G-E-320
  308 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
is that the worker lacks social training and an intel- 
ligent understanding of his economic adjustment to 
labor. If the first constructive activities are social- 
ized, a step has been taken in economic training. 
It Affords Hsthetic Training. — The joy of creating 
or constructing is not necessarily tied up with esthetic 
appreciation of the thing made. When a child makes 
a kite or a cart, or molds apples out of clay, he is often 
carried into enthusiasm because he enjoys doing 
something, ‘being a cause”’ of changes in the paper or 
wood or clay. However, he is more prone to esthetic 
appreciation of his own work than of the work of 
others because of the effort he has put into it. If the 
play leadership is such that the constructive result has 
also some small artistic merit, the transition between 
crudity and beauty, utilitarian and esthetic, is made 
more readily. 
Sex Differences in Manipulative and Constructive 
Abilities. — A study of sex differences in any field 
brings us to the interesting conclusion that there is 
more variation in abilities among members of the 
same sex than exists between the opposite sexes. 
However, it is interesting to note, in regard to motor 
ability of the sexes, that in strength, rapidity of move- 
ment, and rate of fatigue men seem to have an easily 
measurable advantage, and in precision of movement 
aslight advantage. The only concern we need have in 
the field of play is to see that girls have wider oppor- 
tunities for muscular experimentation than have 
hitherto been provided; for in every group of girls 
there are always some who can perform successfully 
many muscular feats men perform; there are others
-P-A-G-E-321
  MANIPULATION AS A PLAY ACTIVITY 309 
who will fall far below the average for male achieve- 
ment. 
Manipulative Activities in the School. — Nearly all 
manipulative activities are included in courses in 
practical arts. The first six grades, however, do not 
teach the practical arts from the vocational point of 
view. The aim is to provide activity centers with 
which to correlate subject matter and to enrich the 
child’s experience by giving him various contacts. 
The modern elementary school includes many of the 
practical arts in its curriculum; it has long been 
recognized that breadth of interest is more necessary 
during these early years than in the years to follow. 
Principles Controlling Progress in Manipulation. — 
To plead for a psychological order of procedure in 
providing for manipulative activities seems almost 
unnecessary in the light of modern reforms in ele- 
mentary education. It is not an uncommon thing to 
see children in progressive schools flit about naturally 
from one constructive activity to another; to see them 
lie flat on the floor as they play with blocks, or sit 
comfortably at low tables to mold with sand and clay. 
However, the rules of procedure in brief are as follows: 
(1) large, coarse movements should precede small, fine 
ones; (2) large materials such as sand, clay, large 
blocks, and large crayons, should be given before such 
materials as scissors, small crayon, and painting 
materials; (3) in all manipulative activities, work 
for the sake of expression should precede work for 
technique. Originality shou'd not be expected until 
some technique has been gained.

  The Project in Connection with Manipulations. — 
According to W. H. Kilpatrick, a project may refer to 
any kind or variety of life experience which is actuated 
by a dominating purpose. He notes four types of 
projects. It is with the first that we are especially con- 
cerned as we study manipulations. ‘The first type 
represents those experiences in which the dominating 
purpose is to do, to make, or to effect; to embody an 
idea or aspiration in material form. The material of 
which the thing it made, in which the idea is to be 
embodied, may vary from clay, wood, cloth, and the 
like, through marble or pigment, to the words and 
thoughts and aspirations of a letter, a speech, a poem, 
a symphony, or a prayer. * * * The criterion for 
judging is the character of the purpose. Is there an 
idea to be embodied?” ! The project may be very 
simple and easily accomplished, as when a child in the 
kindergarten decides to build a wagon in order that 
he may play store, and finally accomplishes this end 
the same day. It may be so complex that it requires 
the combined efforts of a group for a considerable 
period of time to bring about the desired result. 
All manipulative activities are not necessarily proj- 
ects. To partake of the nature of projects they must 
represent purposeful planning where the aim is fixed, 
guide the means used to reach it, and furnish its 
motivation. 
Constructive Activities. — Interest in manipulative 
or constructive activities leads to a large number of

Project Method and How to Overcome Them—A Symposium,’

MANIPULATION AS A PLAY ACTIVITY 311 
experimentations. The constructive efforts of children 
take us far afield into life. Contact with earth, air, 
light, heat, fire, and water demand manipulation on 
the part of the child. Just as primitive man in his 
efforts to sustain life and procure for himself food,

shelter, and clothing found it necessary to subdue and 
control natural forces and materials, so children, in 
their efforts to handle and discover, learn to make 
plastic materials serve their purposes. Children, 
however, learn to control such natural forces as sand, 
clay, and water not because of any outer compulsion
-P-A-G-E-324
  
312 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
such as impelled primitive man to subdue them, but 
because of the inner urge to manipulate and handle. 
The writer regrets that the limitations of the written 
page necessitate a rather arbitrary classification of 
children’s projects with sand, clay, water, etc. How- 
ever, the records themselves show how rich and varied 
children’s experimentations are, and how their thought 
breaks down the barriers of materials and circumvents 
the limitations of natural forces. 
Learning through Manipulative Activities. al In 
their playful experimentation children learn much 
about the qualities of things, and discover the applica- 
tion of many natural and mechanical laws.) For 
example, in gardening the child learns how to control 
conditions of heat and moisture. In building bridges, 
dams, and boats, he discovers the pressure of fluids 
and the laws of density, buoyancy, and _ specific 
gravity. In building fires, he acquires information 
about draughts and combustion. In experimenting 
with kites, windmills, and airplanes he obtains a 
knowledge of air currents and air pressure. In 
playing with mirrors and prisms, in blowing soap 
bubbles, and in making shadow pictures, he learns 
something of the reflection and refraction of light. 
In producing acoustic effects with toys such as drums, 
reed pipes, and whistles, he gains a practical knowledge 
of resonance and density of air. Many of the records 
involving manipulation, experimentation, and curi- 
osity will show, better than any discussion can point 
out, the joy, manual skill, scientific knowledge, and 
social insight gained by children through play activities 
involving natural forces and materials.

  CHAPTER XXI 
SPONTANEOUS PLAY IN THE EARTH 
Spontaneous Play in the Earth is Natural to Chil- 
dren. — The child of to-day shares with children of all 
ages the delight of playing with soil, sand, and clay. 
Without training he rolls, molds, pokes, and handles 
the earth. In all such play the natural impulse to 
manipulate is satisfied by doing something and having 
something happen as a result. The child likes to 
roll in the grass, pile up stones, dig in the moist sand 
with his hands and feet, poke holes in the ground 
with a stick, dig with implements, shape and mold clay 
into creations of his own fancy, till and plant the soil; 
in fact, he likes to test in multiform ways his power 
over materials and natural forces. Perhaps the 
following incidents will illustrate the spontaneous 
interest which contact with soil, sand, and clay affords 
children. The writer once observed some street- 
cleaners deposit a pile of sand in front of a house. 
Instantly all the children of the neighborhood con- 
gregated on the spot, and all during the day numbers 
of them worked like busy bees digging, molding, and 
building in the sand. At another time the author 
was visiting a playground located near the banks of 
the Monongahela River in Pittsburgh. The children 
had discovered a natural clay bed and were wild with 
interest in molding and shaping the moist clay. 
Some of the children made cups, saucers, plates, plat- 
313
-P-A-G-E-326
314 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
ters, and fruit baskets, putting them into immediate 
use on a hastily improvised tea table. Others set 
up a box for a counter and started a store. They 
did not care to sell, so occupied were they in making 
things and arranging them on the counter: cabbages, 
apples, pears, plums, potatoes, loaves of bread, sticks 
of candy —all made of clay. For more than two 
hours these children played happily and constructively. 
As an example of spontaneous gardening we have but 
to recall the story of the boy who dug up the grass and 
sod on a beautiful lawn, in order to plant some grass 
seed, which he carefully covered with loose earth. 
Play in Sand. — From the time when the baby 
begins to sift sand through his tiny fingers just for the 
satisfaction the ‘‘feel’’ of it affords, through the years 
when sand serves as a medium for reproducing the 
environment,! a sand pile should be easy of access to 
the growing boy or girl. As Joseph Lee says: 
“Children never tire of it. The very day of their 
return from the seashore, where they had lived 
actually on a sand beach, they rushed out and began 
playing with the sand box as if they had never seen a 
handful of such material before. The reason, of 
course, as I have elsewhere stated, is that sand is 
plastic to their hands, and more, that it takes the form 
they imagine for it, instead of following some precon- 
ception of its own.” 2 
Community Work in the Sand Table. — Of com- 
munity work in the sand table, Dr. Gesell says the 
1See G. S. Hall’s “The Story of a Sand Pile,” Aspects of Child 
Life and Education. 
2 Quoted by W. B. Forbush: The Manual of Play, p. 13.
-P-A-G-E-327
SPONTANEOUS PLAY IN THE EARTH 315 
following: ‘‘Each child may have a part in building 
the farm, the Indian or the Eskimo village, the circus 
or store. Community work and a common respon- 
sibility establish a feeling of comradeship of which 
the schools are sorely in need. It gives an oppor- 
tunity for just comparisons and mutual suggestions. 
The children will work in pairs or in groups of three or 
four, solving their problems independently, but being 
obliged to conform to the general purpose or plan.”’ ! 
The Scope of Representation in the Sand Pile. — 
As the records show, almost any experience vital to 
childhood is represented in the sand pile, with or 
without the addition of other materials. Farm life is 
depicted, parks and zoos are laid out; fruit stands, 
bakeries, and stores operate on busy streets; circus 
tents are set up and the menagerie is installed on the 
grounds; soldiers’ camps are constructed and war 
carried on. It matters not whether the ideas drama- 
tized are gained through history, literature, or in the 
everyday walks of life, all are realistically played out. 
The records presented show the type of spontaneous 
sand play which occurs on a playground. Where 
smaller groups of children play together, better edu- 
cational results can be obtained than where the sand: 
pile is congested. The presence of a play leader 
insures progress. She clarifies and enlarges the chil- 
dren’s ideas through suitable suggestions or through 
the use of stories or pictures. 
Materials Used in the Sand. — Children of two and 
three years of age need few materials for play in the 
sand. They enjoy sifting the dry sand through their

fingers, heaping it loosely in piles, throwing it about, 
and burying their hands deep in the sand. Given 
shovels, pails, and spoons they occupy themselves 
for hours filling buckets with sand and emptying the 
sand out of the buckets. They also enjoy sifting sand 
through cans with perforated tops. When the sand 
is moist, young children soon jJearn to pat little cakes 
in the hollows of their hands. Later, after they have 
acquired skill in doing this, sand molds of various 
sizes and shapes add zest to the play and suggest new 
possibilities. Children of kindergarten age usually 
mold with their hands trees, roads, houses, and 
figures. It is possible to purchase a tin village for 
sand modeling. This set consists of hollow figures of 
houses, trees, and other objects. After filling the 
forms with moist sand it is possible for children to 
transfer these molded forms to the sand _ table. 
Wooden stencils for molding in the sand are also 
procurable. These are used by the children to 
transfer pictures into the sand. For printing in the 
sand there are boxes of raised letters.!. Molds of fish, 
birds, animals, and of various geometrical patterns 
are to be found in nearly every department store. 
A wooden sand mill with a wheel which turns around 
by the action of the sand is also much enjoyed by the 
children. The writer has a vivid recollection of 
playing for hours in her childhood with a sand mill 
made out of a tin can perforated in several places so 
that the sand kept running out by the force of gravity. 
It is evident to anyone who has watched children play

Play, p. 298.

318 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
in the sand that they are ready and willing to invent 
their own materials as the need arises. The records 
will show how cannon were made out of old window- 
shades; trees and flowers, from twigs and tissue 
paper; soldiers, out of clothespins dressed up; a 
menagerie out of waterproof roofing paper; ducks, 
fish, and frogs were cut from paper and mounted on 
corks so that they would float on water; houses were 
constructed of blocks, boards, and spools; and wagons, 
telephones, and street cars were hastily improvised 
out of cardboard boxes, spools, ribbon bolts, collar 
buttons, and milk-bottle tops. A tool chest and 
boxes of sewing material are indispensable aids in 
meeting emergency calls for materials to enhance 
dramatic and constructive play in the sand. 
How Play in Sand Correlates with School Sub- 
jects. — The sand pile presents opportunity to the 
teacher for constructive suggestions in the use of 
number through collecting the objects molded and 
arranging them in groups; in art, through the forms 
molded; and in physics, through the control of phys- 
ical laws in constructing with sand. Miss Frances 
McGough mentions some of these possibilities in an 
article on ‘The Sand Pile — Its Use and Care’’: 
“The next development is that in which the molded 
sand is turned out of the mold for further play. The 
handling is no longer an end but a means by which 
the child is enabled to weave innumerable imaginative 
and imitative plays. The boy becomes a grocer and 
weighs out sugar for his customers. The girl is a 
homemaker and the sand becomes sugar, flour, tea; 
in fact, anything which it in any way suggests. Who
-P-A-G-E-331
  
SPONTANEOUS PLAY IN THE EARTH 319 
has not made mud pies, and perhaps tried to eat them? 
In connection with the store plays, counting and 
measuring plays spring up. Buying and selling sugar 
and similar commodities call for weights and measures. 
The words pint and quart begin to be heard, although 
the vessels which the child uses to represent these 
measurements are very diminutive. When the chil- 
dren begin to do this the teacher may use the oppor- 
tunity to introduce real measures. Crude scales are 
also used for weighing. The baker sells cakes by the 
dozen and half dozen. Artistic tendencies exhibit 
themselves through the efforts of the children to 
obtain and use prettily shaped molds for their cake- 
making and through attempts to decorate the cakes 
with pretty flowers, pictures traced in the sand with 
sticks, or designs of small pebbles.’’ ‘‘Older children, 
especially the boys, delight in plays that show the 
operation of physical laws. They delight in crudely 
constructed sand mills. They have been known to 
spend hours in the construction of a gravity road, down 
a winding pathway on a mountain of sand. If the 
curve of the road or the inclination of the slope is not 
just right the marbles go over the side instead of 
rolling down the pathway made for them. There is a 
feeling of real triumph when the road is just right and 
the marbles at last go racing round the curves and 
finally reach their resting place at the bottom.” ! 
How to Construct Sand Boxes, Trays, and Bins for

installed. If a kindergarten sand table is used, a 
table top can be put over it whenever the use of table 
space is desired. Window seats can be so constructed 
that zinc-lined sand trays may be fitted in near the 
top, while a space for toys remains below; doors open- 
ing up in sections on top make the sand trays available 
for use, and when closed form the window seat. Sand 
trays may also be built under the floor by cutting a 
sectional door in the floor. Care to cleanse the sand 
by frequent exposure to the sun is quite necessary. 
The outdoor sand pile should have both shade and 
sun, because if there is no sun the sand soon becomes 
unsanitary, and if there is no shade the sand becomes 
hot and baked in appearance, and the children un- 
comfortable when using it. A tree affords the best 
kind of shade for a sand pile; it is cooler than the 
canvas shades sometimes stretched on frames above 
the playground sand piles, and affords an ideal com- 
bination of shade and sun. Any building sand or 
bank sand will prove satisfactory, although, of course, 
the white sand of the seashore is best. The sand bin 
may be built of any desired size; twelve-inch planks 
make a sufficiently deep box. A ledge about eight 
inches wide should surround the box. This may be 
used as a shelf on which to mold cakes or to display 
wares in store plays. 
Gardening 
The Appeal of Gardening. — Digging in the soil is 
almost an instinctive pleasure with children. It 
seems to appeal to nerve cells in some way that makes 
for relaxation and emotional contentment. Children
-P-A-G-E-334
  322 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
like to dig and scratch in the soil and, until taught to 
protect and nurture growing things, they often 
uproot and demolish. From this genuine interest in 
digging in the soil it is but a step to planting and 
gardening. Native curiosity often impels busy hands 
to dig up what they have planted that eager eyes may 
search for the first signs of life. To meet this instinctive 
interest in digging and planting, many playgrounds 
have established community gardens in the neighbor- 
hoods near by. In these gardens each child may have 
his own plot, and dig, plant, and nurture, aided by 
the wind, rain, and sun. 
There is something so elemental and primitive about 
children’s enjoyment of digging and planting that we 
need to give it more serious consideration. 
The Educational Content of Gardening. — Garden- 
ing is rich in educational content; it affords rich 
contacts and gives children of different ages a chance 
to learn about nature through working with her, 
applying her laws, and observing the wonders she 
creates. It is the ‘‘doing’’ side that is important. 
However, the knowing side should not be left out of 
consideration. As a means of understanding the 
harvest, our source of food supply, the home and 
school garden offers a center of correlation. Excur- 
sions to enlarge the child’s conception of the harvest, 
the marketing of crops, transportation, prices, and cost 
of production, all bring a better understanding of the 
significance of gardening. There are many approaches 
to gardening, all of which have a point of contact in 
play and a significance in education. First, there is 
the esthetic side, the interest in beauty of color,
-P-A-G-E-335
  SPONTANEOUS PLAY IN THE EARTH 323 
form, and design. Then there is the appeal of neat- 
ness and orderliness; through raking up leaves and 
burning weeds, children learn the value of tidiness in a 
garden. The economic side also has some educational 
importance. Children like to use what they grow 
and thus come to 
know the relative 
economic values 
and uses of var- 
ious herbs, fruits, 
and vegetables. 
The scientific in- 
terest is perhaps 
of paramount 
importance. 
Through caring 
for plants, chil- 
dren learn the life 
cycle of each 
plant and its 
habits of reacting - 
to various kinds 
of soil, temper- 
ature, and rainfall. The hand that manipulates, the 
eye that observes, follow the trail of the scientist and 
formulate laws by direct observation of cause and 
effect.     School of Childhood, University of Pittsburgh

Playing with Clay 
The Appeal of Clay. — Did you ever see a group of 
children yield themselves completely to the enjoy- 
ment which play with clay affords? It is probable
-P-A-G-E-336
  324 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
that to shape and to mold this soft, yielding substance 
is instinctively satisfying. The instinct of manip- 
ulation and the love of workmanship, inherent in 
original nature, combine to make the appeal of clay 
immediate and universal where children are con- 
cerned.. One has but to walk along the crowded 
beaches at any summer resort to observe the tendency 
common to adults to poke, handle, and mold damp 
sand into shapes the fancy suggests. It is as if surplus 
nervous energy were discharged with resulting free- 
dom from strain. Children sometimes quiet down 
instantly as they yield themselves to the enjoyment 
which results from externalizing their ideas and feelings 
in molded clay. 
The Educational Significance of Clay Molding. — 
This study does not aim to apply the values gained in 
observing spontaneous play to subject matter of the 
elementary grades. In regard to the universal use 
of clay in public schools it seems necessary only to 
point out the wide range of experimentation which 
has resulted in courses in the practical arts. 
Records of Sand Plays 
Play in Dry Sand. Washington Park. — One day 
a new sand table appeared in the Washington Park 
playroom. The small children from two and a half 
to six years old gathered quickly around it and began 
to handle the dry sand. Some of the smallest 
children delighted in sifting the sand through their 
fingers: one child said it was salt; another called it 
sugar. They enjoyed burying one hand by sifting 
sand from the other hand gently over it. Other, 
 
-P-A-G-E-337
  PLAYS IN THE SAND
-P-A-G-E-338
  326 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
children started at once to pile up the sand; two or 
three connected their piles. Some dug wells. Others 
made sand piles of varying sizes and dug holes in the 
tops for chimneys, evidently intending to make 
houses. One child built a large sand pile and called 
it a mountain, tracing a railroad track around the 
base. 
Carrying Sand. Washington Park. — By mistake, 
a load of sand was dumped on the ground instead of in 
the sand boxes. The children played they were 
expressmen and street cleaners. For several days 
they shovelled the sand into small wheelbarrows and 
carted it to the boxes. One child played ‘‘boss’’ and 
directed the work of the others. 
Houses. Lewis Playground. — Each child in th 
group made his own house and yard in the sand box, 
Some built walls around their houses; others sur. 
rounded them with fences. The houses varied i 
size and appearance; some had doors, chimneys, an 
steps shaped in the wet sand; a few houses were buil 
of sand and blocks together; these last were larger an 
stronger than the others. Nearly all the childre 
gathered grass to put in the yards. 
Farmyard Play.!— One day a group of children mad 
a farm scene in the sand table. The following mornin 
a little girl brought a tiny wooden dog to guard th 
farm. Other animals were contributed and _ th 
children had great fun making the animals walk i 
and out of the farmyard gate. They said the do| 
could live in the house, but the cow, horse, and shee 
must go to the barn. As the first barn constructe}

SPONTANEOUS PLAY IN THE EARTH 327 
was too small to hold all the animals, a larger one had 
to be built. They planned a barn in which there was 
room for all the cows and the horse; they also built 
separate kennels for the dogs, pens for the pigs, and 
coops for the chickens. 
Gardens. Washington Park.— A group of chil- 
dren made gardens in the sand. Each child marked 
off a space for himself. He next asked for some tissue 
paper, and twisted small pieces of it into flowers; 
these he planted in straight rows and circles, using 
green, blue, and yellow in various combinations. 
When these small gardens were finished several 
children made a large park and built a fence of blocks 
around it. 
Gardens and Farm. Sullivan Playground. — One 
day the children became much interested in making 
gardens in the sand; this interest grew into the laying 
out of a farm into fields, orchards, and a house. 
Then the children seemed satisfied and proceeded to 
play farmer. They loaded the wagon with grass 
to represent hay, pulled it a short distance, and then 
unloaded it in the barn. After loading and unloading 
several times it occurred to them to unhitch the horses. 
In this simple little play, the loading and unloading seemed to be 
the chief point. Interest in constructing the farm and wagon was 
subservient to the playing out of a little drama, representing some 
familiar events connected with farming. 
Park and Zoo. Wickersham School Playground. — 
Some of the children had been taken by their parents 
to picnics at Kennywood and Highland parks. On 
the playground the next day they built an amusement 
park, laying out car tracks and constructing a roller 
 
-P-A-G-E-340

   coaster and shoot the chutes. They hollowed out a 
lake, filled it with water, and put paper boats on it. 
After they had sailed the boats a while, it occurred to 
them to make a zoo. They decided this should not be 
near the car tracks, lest the animals be frightened. 
So they selected a quiet corner of the park and dug 
caves for the different animals. This play con- 
tinued for several days. 
Fruit Stand. Arsenal Park. — The children molded 
wet sand into apples, pears, and peaches, using twigs 
for stems. They arranged these on a board for a 
fruit stand and sold fruit to passers-by. 
Beehives. Ormsby Park. — One day the children 
made beehives in the sand by covering cubes with 
damp sand. 
Street Life. Ralston School Playground. — A very 
quiet business street was represented, having a meat 
market, grocery, bakery, and bank. Next, a resi- 
dence street was laid out exactly parallel to the 
business section. Homes were built along both sides 
of the street; telephones were put up and business 
flourished for some time. 
Baking Day. Soho Club Playground. — A group 
of small children made cakes of various shapes by 
molding wet sand in tins. They arranged the cakes 
in rows on the board. One little girl said she had a 
store and called to some other children to come and 
buy some of her cakes. A boy who was building an 
elaborate house of blocks came over to buy; then he 
went back to his building again. The play leader| 
suggested that he might telephone for the cakes nex 
time, since he was so busy. He looked pleased and|
-P-A-G-E-341
SPONTANEOUS PLAY IN THE EARTH 329 
quickly grasped the necessity of putting up a telephone 
system between his house and the bakery. He found 
two sticks which served as poles, and some string 
which he used for the wires. It proved great fun to 
shout out his orders; so much so that a group of older 
boys and girls gathered around the sand pile to set to 
work building similar houses and telephones. This 
led to more telephoning, which kept the girl in the 
bakery so busy that she called on another girl to bake 
cakes while she answered the telephone. A small boy 
offered to deliver the cakes; this necessitated his 
building roads between the houses. When he had 
laid out a complete line of roads, he took an oblong 
block for a wagon and pushed it around from house to 
house, leaving a cake at each house where a cake had 
been ordered. This play continued nearly all of one 
afternoon. 
Schenley Park. Lewis Playground. — One day a 
group of boys laid out Schenley Park in the sand; 
Carnegie Library and Phipps Conservatory were 
constructed of blocks and somewhat resembled these 
buildings. Another group of boys made a train shed; 
tracks were laid out and a train constructed of blocks 
was pushed along the tracks and under the tunnels. 
Burying Play. Lewis Playground.— A group of 
boys had great fun all one afternoon, burying each 
other, all but their heads, in the sand. 
Caves. Sullivan Playground.— Some boys from 
ten to twelve years of age became much interested in 
making caves. As they gained experience in sur- 
mounting the obstacles of construction, the caves grew 
larger and more substantial. One day all the older
-P-A-G-E-342
  
330 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
children joined in making one large cave. They used 
blocks to strengthen the walls, cementing them together 
with sand. They called this cave a fort and selected 
soldiers to act as guards. The smaller children 
wanted to crawl into the fort, but were not permitted 
to do so by the guards. These little ones then made 
forts of their own, building a deep trench between 
their forts and the big one. 
Park. Mt. Washington School Playground. — An 
elaborate city park was made, also a street car line. 
Lights were put up all along the car track; string was 
used as overhead wire for the street cars. 
Tunnels, Bridges, and Ponds. Washington Park.— 
About a dozen children were playing in the sand; 
some made tunnels, bridges, and houses; others buried 
pails in the sand to represent ponds and watering 
troughs. This suggested bringing animals to drink, 
and the rubberoid animals were taken to drink. The 
children decided that these animals must have a place 
to live; so large stables were built in the sand. The 
stables were soon full of occupants. 
Parks. National Tube Company Playground. — 
All the younger children worked together to make a 
park in the sand. They laid out walks, circular and 
straight, and designed flower beds of various shapes. 
For flowers they twisted up bits of brightly colored 
’ tissue paper, for trees they set out twigs and small 
branches. The swings they constructed by fastening 
a crosspiece to two upright sticks and suspending 
rope swings from the crosspiece. In these swings they 
placed dolls cut from manila paper. The play 
leader cut a ring of dolls hand in hand. This pleased
-P-A-G-E-343
SPONTANEOUS PLAY IN THE EARTH 331 
the children very much; they said the dolls were 
playing ‘‘Ring Around the Rosy.” After the children 
had given the dolls a swing they decided to make a 
roller coaster. This was modeled out of sand, a spool 
box serving as a car. Then the dolls were taken the 
round of the park, some to swing, some to ride on the 
roller coaster, and some to look at the flowers. 
Park Attractions. Andrews School Playground. — 
A group of girls molded the Old Mill of Kennywood 
Park, also the roller coaster. The last was elaborately 
represented with a double track leading down slopes 
and hollows. For many days different groups of 
children worked out this scene in various ways, adding 
a lake, café, and other details. One day two leaden 
Indians were placed on the crest of the slope to act as 
spies. This changed the entire character of the play. 
Circus. Arsenal Park. — Some of the children had 
been to a circus. They wanted to cut out animals, 
so the play leader brought patterns and let them trace 
and cut tigers, elephants, bears, lions, and giraffes 
from rubberoid roofing. The next day the children 
brought boxes of various sizes and made cages for the 
different animals by cutting slits along the edge of the 
top and bottom of each box and running wooden slats 
through the slits. They put each animal in a suitable 
cage and then surveyed the results. The outdoor 
sand box was decided by all to be the best circus field. 
The children carried the cages there and arranged 
them to face out along the four sides of the box. One 
child opened a ticket office. Any child purchasing 
a ticket was allowed to walk around the circus field to 
see the animals.

Forts. Washington Park. — The children made a 
big fort in the sand. They built the fort with oblong 
blocks and fortified its inside walls with sand shovels. 
Pieces of lath formed a barricade, beneath which they 
dug a ditch. This was done by a few boys, who, in 
order to complete their fort, took the blocks away 
from the smaller boys. These smaller boys organized 
themselves into a band, built a sand fort, and had a 
battle with the older boys, getting some of their 
blocks back again. 
Forts. Arsenal Park. — Several boys became inter- 
ested in making long mountain ranges with tunnels 
penetrating lengthwise and crosswise; then they built 
forts. One large fort was hexagonal in shape; the 
boys called it Fort Duquesne. Another was oblong, 
modelled from the Arsenal Park House; it was called 
Fort Shelby after the commander, who rode around 
the park and stopped every day to watch the children. 
Flags waved from these forts; fine roadways led up to 
them, and earthen breastworks protected them. 
Towers of blocks served as lookout stations for 
sentinels. Ends of old window shades were rolled 
up to represent cannon and were placed in the lookout 
holes along the sides of both forts. Near by, the boys 
set up an Indian camp; the wigwams were made of 
rag paper. A general war followed between the paper 
soldiers and Indians. 
Pike’s Peak. Andrews School Playground. — The 
children made an enormous hill which they called 
Pike’s Peak. A car line was built around it and 
passengers were taken up to see the sights.

Soldiers’ Camp. Lawrence Park. — A high hill, at 
the bottom of which stood a row of tents surrounded 
by a sand wall, was the soldiers’ encampment. Some 
little girls opened a bakery and sold pies to the soldiers, 
receiving paper money in return. At another store 
some girls sold paper badges, tents, and soldier caps 
they had made. 
War between Indians and English. Andrews 
School Playground. — The English forts were built of 
blocks and fortified with cannon. The soldiers took 
daily gallops astride brooms. The Indian village was 
in the sand pile; the Indian wigwams were made of 
brooms arranged in tent shape and covered with 
brown paper. A wooden box was the Indian canoe; a 
broom, their paddle. Every day one of the English 
soldiers mounted his horse and rode after the mail. 
One day be brought back a piece of wood on which the 
Indians had written a declaration of war. Both sides 
prepared for war. The Indians won the first battle, 
the English the second. Both sides seemed willing to 
take turns at losing. 
Houses, Forts, and Airplanes. Lewis Playground.— 
Some girls built rows of houses, surrounding each 
house with a picket fence made of sticks. The boys 
made elaborate forts with flags flying from the 
summits; paths led from the forts in all directions; 
paper soldiers stood at the lookout posts and other 
soldiers appeared to be ready to fire paper cannon. 
A group of boys suggested that an airplane was needed; 
so one was made to fly about the forts to afford pro- 
tection from the enemy.

Outline Pictures in the Sand. Lewis Playground. — 
After a rain which left the sand hard and moist the 
children started to draw pictures. First they patted 
and pounded the sand into a smooth, slate-like surface. 
They drew outlines of houses, barns, trees, flowers, 
chickens, coops, hens, and pigs. One child drew a 
flag. Another child laid out a rough but good map of 
Pittsburgh, with the two rivers coming together at the 
point near the block house and with Penn Avenue 
running fairly parallel with the Allegheny River and 
Second Avenue with the Monongahela. 
Goldilocks and the Three Bears. Wickersham 
Playground. — Some little girls made a park showing 
a lake with a few paper boats sailing on it. Flowers 
were made by pinching sand between the fingers. 
The flowers suggested the story of Goldilocks and the 
Three Bears. ‘‘Here she was lost while picking 
flowers,’’ they said. The park became the woods 
where the three bears took their daily walk. A 
house was built of sand and Goldilocks’ experiences 
in the three bears’ home were played out most 
realistically. 
Washington Crossing the Delaware. Arsenal Park 
Playground. — The children had enjoyed working 
out a large puzzle representing the famous picture of 
Washington Crossing the Delaware. One day when 
playing in the sand, a boy made a boat out of sand 
and assembled on its decks guns (clothespins) and 
paper soldiers. Other children became interested and 
offered to build forts along the shore; these were very 
carefully built forts guarded by soldiers and guns and 
connected with the shore by means of drawbridges. 
 
-P-A-G-E-347

A deep trench surrounded the fort. The sand was left 
loose and rough to represent ice. The picture when 
completed pleased the children very much. 
A Battlefield in the Sand Pile. Adams Market 
Playground.'!— It was nine o’clock in the morning, the 
beginning of a bright summer day. We were in the 
heart of a congested business district in Pittsburgh, 
where every inch of space is occupied, save a narrow 
lot granted by the city as a breathing spot for the 
children living in the crowded thoroughfares and 
alleys of this district. 
From all sides the children came flocking in, some 
happy and buoyant, others sullen and ill-tempered; 
yet all eager to play. I decided to wait and utilize 
any interest that might spring up. The toys, buckets, 
shovels, and other play materials were brought out; 
as usual, the sand pile attracted the greatest number 
of children, who were scattered in loose groups over 
the field. ‘‘Let’s build a fort,’’ was the proposal of 
some boys. At once all became interested. In a 
minute the sand pile was cleared of pails, shovels, and 
babies and the blocks were carried, wheeled, and flung 
upon the field of operation. The boys divided 
themselves into two groups, one taking charge of the 
building of the fort, the other establishing some sort 
of arsenal or workshop where the equipment of the 
fort and the camp ground was planned and carried 
out. A strong and substantial fort was built of 
wooden blocks with windows just big enough to 
permit the sending of bullets and cannon-balls. At 
2 This play was supervised, recorded, and contributed in the present 
form by Mrs. Hermine A. Johnson.
-P-A-G-E-348
  
336 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
one side a flower garden was laid out and enclosed 
by a fence made of clothespins. A deep ditch, 
spanned with several bridges, divided the sand pile 
along its whole length into two parts. The boys 
were working on both sides, adding, improving, and 
changing according to their ideas. 
So far everything went smoothly and no thought of 
using the encampment as a battlefield entered the 
boys’ minds. Yet war was close at hand. Some ditch 
diggers had come into too close contact with a group 
of other boys who were making a fort on the other side 
and the two sides began to quarrel about the territory. 
The clashing of shovels and words called me to their 
side and I overheard two boys saying to each other, 
“They are British; let’s beat them.” Ina minute the 
sand pile became the scene of feverish activity. Two 
hostile battlefields were forming— here the Americans, 
there the British. The spirit of '76 had taken pos- 
session of the sand pile and the Revolutionary War 
was to be lived over again. Most strenuous efforts 
of attack and defense were made on both sides; in- 
trenchments were thrown up and barricades built. 
It was very evident that the enthusiasm of the English 
side did not keep pace with that on the American 
side and by and by the majority had left the British 
forces. I asked the boys if they thought it fair to 
desert their posts, but they declared the English must 
not be strong, ‘“‘for we are going to beat them.” 
Meanwhile the workers in the arsenal had not been 
idle. Tents, flags, and cannon were constructed and 
sent out to their place of destination. When the 
tents appeared they were objected to. ‘They are no
-P-A-G-E-349
SFONTANEOUS PLAY IN THE EARTH 337 
good,” the boys said. ‘‘They are Indian tents.” 
The defect was soon remedied by placing an American 
flag on top; the tents then met the approval of the 
critics. These tents were placed in rows of five; flags 
were arranged on the grounds of both British and 
Americans; yet the boys were careful to keep the best 
on the American side, while the ones of inferior grade 
were shipped to the British. The cannon were con- 
structions of some ingenuity; a cylindrical box, two 
milk-bottle tops (for wheels), and a meat skewer put 
together made quite a realistic cannon of the primitive 
type. The boys stationed one cannon upon the 
highest point of defense; at once the necessity of a 
soldier behind the cannon was keenly felt and word 
was sent to the workshop to produce such a soldier. 
In response a paper soldier was cut out and brought 
over, but he stood so weakly on his feet and looked so 
little the part of a man of strength and courage that 
he was scornfully rejected and soon disappeared. 
Then some bright boy ran to the flower garden and 
came back with a clothespin, which he planted beside 
the cannon. This soldier at least had the qualities of 
strength and steadfastness, but he could make nobody 
believe he was anything but a clothespin. So he 
had to go to the arsenal for transformation, and 
transformed he was when he came back, on his head 
the typical George Washington hat and in his arms a 
gun which pointed directly toward the camp of the 
British. In a moment all the clothespin fence rails 
were unearthed and transformed into an army of 
warriors, or rather into two armies, for some regiments 
were sent over to the British side. The two armies
-P-A-G-E-350
338 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
were easily distinguishable by their differently colored 
caps; the Americans wore blue, the other side white 
caps. Meanwhile other work had been going on in 
both camps. A big Union Jack was hoisted on top 
of the British fort and smaller flags, targets, and 
signal boards were distributed everywhere. Both 
sides now were swarming with soldiers armed with 
guns and carrying flags. The intensity of the play 
began to reach a climax, new ideas springing up in 
close succession. ‘‘Here comes the Doctor,’’ shouted 
a youngster bringing in a clothespin soldier on whose 
breast was plastered a red cross. ‘‘Watch the 
ambulance,’’ was the next announcement; and in 
came a vehicle constructed of an oblong box with four 
wheels of milk-bottle tops, each side decorated with a 
red cross. The ambulance was placed by the side of 
the surgeon. As my idea of how a battlefield should 
be run was rather vague, the boys had often to 
explain what it all meant. ‘‘Here is a soldier with a 
white cap in the American camp. Why don’t you 
keep him where he belongs?”’ I criticized. ‘‘Why, he 
is a captive,” I was told. ‘‘And these soldiers 
haven’t any caps on their heads at all,” I objected. 
“They’re shot off,’’ was the prompt reply. Near the 
British fort I found a bridge, with two white-capped 
soldiers standing on top and two blue-capped ones 
- underneath. ‘‘What are these Americans doing here 
under the bridge?’’ I asked. ‘‘They are — they 
are — what you call those men who sneak around to 
find out about the enemy?” ‘‘Spies,”’ I helped out. 
“Yes, yes! They are spies. Do you see them 
hiding under the bridge? They can hear every word
-P-A-G-E-351
  SPONTANEOUS PLAY IN THE EARTH 339 
the British say.’’ In a corner near the American side 
I came across a small building with something looking 
like a steeple. ‘‘What’s this’? I asked. ‘‘That’s the 
church Paul Revere rode away from,” said my in- 
formant. ‘‘And this man here, what is he doing 
down here in the ditch?’’ “It’s George Washington 
crossing the Delaware.” 
“Come over here,” said another boy. ‘I am 
building Independence Hall, but I don’t know where 
to get the bell.”” I walked over to the venerable 
structure. ‘‘I will try to get one,’’ I promised. But 
Liberty Bell was not to ring for us on the playground; 
in its stead all the noon whistles began to blow, 
calling the boys to dinner and thus causing an inter- 
ruption in our work. ‘Don’t let us break the fort 
up; save it all till this afternoon,’”’ was the general 
request. Two or three boys volunteered to watch 
until the others came back to take their places. 
When we returned that afternoon we found the 
camp ground untouched, except that some little 
vandals had thrown a handful of oats among the 
tents. I asked the boys to pick up the oats; unfor- 
tunately this request was misunderstood and the 
boys took it as a signal for a general breaking up. 
In a minute sticks and stones were hailing down upon 
the battlefield, smashing indiscriminately the British 
and the American, sparing neither friend nor foe, 
neither the doctor beside the ambulance nor George 
Washington in the ditch. In less than a minute the 
work of three hours was undone, destroyed with the 
same zest and exultation with which it was created, 
and the boys who were the leaders and the main

workers were the first to tear down the labor of their 
own hands. I was stunned and perplexed for a 
moment; then I understood. During the whole 
morning the boys’ activity was directed towards the 
one goal — the making of a battlefield. So far their 
work had been constructive, well planned, preparatory 
for things to come. This was one phase of their play. 
Now the other part had to come, for war means de- 
struction, annihilation, lawlessness. All the morning 
this spirit of war had been ‘urking in their conscious- 
ness, ready to break forth as soon as the intensity of 
their work would relax. So, long suppressed, it now 
broke forth with a vengeance, sweeping everything 
within its reach. The battle had to come, and here 
it was.

   CHAPTER XXII 
SPONTANEOUS PLAY WITH FIRE AND WATER 
Fire as Known Through Myths. — The fire myths 
of many races indicate the almost universal use of 
fire long before the annals of history. In myth 
generally fire is regarded as a living thing. ‘‘As, 
with primitive man, hunger and thirst are the natural 
enemies of his existence, and his chief source of misery 
or happiness, fire, food, and water became some of 
his earliest gods. * * * Fire especially comes to 
take a principal part in his life, though water worship 
seems to have preceded that of fire. * * * Besides 
warming him and giving him light at night, fire made 
his food taste better and digest easier. * * * The 
mysterious nature of the blazing fire, its apparently 
spontaneous creation, its decomposing power and 
perpetual self-motion, place it far above the other 
elements or natural forces as an object of his venera- 
tion and awe. Thus primitive man was a arena 
fire-worshipping animal.’ ! 
The Fire Playing Propensity. — The conquest of 
fire, the power to understand its significance in the 
life of man, took centuries to accomplish. To-day, 
however, the mind and hand of man utilize fire in 
industries and commerce. Its uses are so complex 
that the average child has few opportunities to see its

      342 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
possibilities. Yet although he does not understand 
the significance of fire in modern industrial life, fire 
appeals to the child. It is difficult to analyze its 
charm. Building bonfires, brandi hing fire-brands, 
and setting off firecrackers are pleasurable activities 
because of the fun of doing something and having 
things happen as a result. Enjoyment in watching 
fire seems to be due to esthetic appreciation of color 
and form. Such plays of visualization, however, do 
not belong in the same category with plays involving 
active experimentation with fire. 
Is the Fire-playing Propensity Ingrained in Original 
Nature? — Of course there are theorists who persist in 
explaining all natural propensities through recapitula- 
tion. To the writer it seems much simpler to account 
for the child’s special interest in fire through pleasure 
in manipulation and experimentation, allowing for 
the special attraction of unusual and startling effects. 
Anyone who has been constantly among children 
knows that the chief enjoyment of a bonfire is in 
touching it off and seeing the results; the same may be 
said of the universal interest in striking matches, 
shooting off firecrackers, and lighting pin-wheels. 
In the last three examples, noise and illumination 
make the results startling and spectacular. 
Fire-playing Common to Both Country and Ci 
Children. — Country children play more freely wit! 
fire than city children, because there are fewer restric 
tions. In winter, the country child revels in the ope: 
fireplace. It is the center of domestic activities 
Children gather in the wood, feed the flames, and soo’ 
learn to discriminate between woods that burn quickl

and those that do not. Here the family group gather 
for warmth and comfort, pop corn, sew, talk, and 
think. When the great logs burn brightly, the 
shadows become bears and tigers as fancy supplies 
shape and contour. In summer the brush is piled 
high in the fields or woods and children’s eager hands 
feed the fire, while their eyes delight in the pictures 
the leaping flames make against the dark sky. 
Country children are taught to fear fire because of the 
disastrous results. Such plays as those mentioned 
above are invariably neighborhood affairs and are 
carefully supervised by adults. 
The city usually prohibits bonfires except at certain 
distances from buildings. Yet wherever there are 
bonfires, children swarm like busy bees, gathering 
leaves or loose pieces of wood and paper to feed the 
hungry flames as fast as the fire can devour them. At 
certain times during the late summer and fall one sees 
children congregated around such bonfires, laughing, 
exclaiming, and, unless prevented from so doing, 
running hither and thither brandishing firebrands. 
In one neighborhood with which the writer was 
familiar the boys came often to the houses, collecting 
papers to burn in sand ovens. Some of these ovens 
were well constructed with good draughts, showing 
that the youthful builders had gained considerable 
knowledge of the principles of combustion and their 
application to heating apparatus. 
Boys Show a Greater Propensity for Fire-playing 
than Girls.— The Camp-fire Girls’ organizations 
utilize active experimentation with fire as well as 
emphasizing its symbolic characteristics. The Boy 
 
-P-A-G-E-356
  
344 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
Scouts’ work also gives opportunity for legitimate 
contact with such elemental forces as fire and water. 
The boys learn to make fire without matches, to cook 
over the campfire, and to perform a series of acts 
which are equally useful and enjoyable. 
Much additional light is thrown on children’s 
delight in fire-playing through the following excerpts 
from a study of “Children’s Ideas of Fire, Heat, 
Frost, and Cold,”’ by C. E. Browne and G. S. Hall.1 
In this study, 148 returns to questions concerning the 
fire-playing propensity were received, 103 were from 
boys and 45 from girls. ‘‘The average age of the 
boys was 6.5; of the girls 6.7. From 71 cases noted 
in the reminiscent returns, as directly observed by the 
writers, there were 36 boys and 35 girls. Of the boys, 
52 per cent played with fire; 47 per cent did not. 
Of the girls, 34 per cent played, 66 per cent did not.” 
It thus seems apparent that boys are more attracted 
by fire than are girls, although the interest seems 
strong with both. 
Various Ways of Playing with Fire. — ‘‘ The delight 
in fire-playing shows itself most commonly in building 
bonfires, 24 per cent of all the instances. The next 
most commonly reported is that of ‘swinging around’ 
or rotating about the vertical axis with burning sticks 
or papers in the hands, 16 per cent. Then, in order, 
follow: Putting of sticks, straws, and other com- 
bustibles into the fire to see them burn, 12 per cent; 
building fires in houses and other buildings, 8 per cent; 
setting buildings on fire 7 per cent; setting curtains, 
bedding, and carpets on fire, 3 per cent; building fires 
1See Pedagogical Seminary, Vol. X, pp. 39-41.
-P-A-G-E-357
  PLAY WITH FIRE AND WATER 345 
for baking or roasting, also in pans and cans, each 2 
per cent, etc. In 14 per cent of these cases among 
the boys, and 4 per cent among the girls, the building 
of fires was accompanied by other activities, as 
running, jumping, whirling the fire around, and 
yelling. Interesting analogies are found in many 
fantastic dances and orgies of the North American 
Indians about their campfires.”” A consideration of 
the distribution of interest in the various kinds of fire 
experimentation mentioned in this study seems to 
bear out the author’s viewpoint that active experi- 
mentation, doing something which brings novel and 
startling results, accounts for the greatest appeal fire 
makes to children. 
Serious Aspects of Fire Play.— The returns also 
emphasize the serious aspects of fire play. .Statistics 
show that more children are burned to death than 
perish from any other cause. Itis likely that their in- 
terest in experimenting with fire grows through periods 
of unprotected and unsupervised play. The training 
in caution regarding fire should begin in earliest baby- 
hood and continue throughout adolescence. How many 
of the cases of destructive fire play cited above are due 
to carelessness about early habits in connection with 
fire and how many are due to the intensity of the desire 
to experiment — a desire so strong that the child seeks 
in unprotected moments to find out how fire acts, will 
never be known. In the case of the writer’s boy, a 
chance five minutes alone was utilized to burn matches 
in the house. ‘‘I just wanted to see why ashes from 
paper are different from those of wood,” said this 
six-year-old child. Extreme punishment and a pro- 
 
-P-A-G-E-358
  346 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
gressive educational program seem the only courses 
for parents to pursue in regard to this dangerous 
tendency to experiment. The sane Fourth of July 
movement is doing much to point out the dangers 
involved by experimentation with fire even where 
fireworks have been manufactured in accordance 
with certain statutes. Spontaneous experimentation 
with fire will be controlled in accordance with the 
measure of supervision over children’s play and with 
education as to the nature of inflammable materials. 
Water as Known through Myths. — Some early 
peoples believed water to be the origin of all things, 
and thought all plant and animal life either came 
from water or was made of water. As Bolton! says 
in substance, through connection with plant life, 
water was regarded as possessed of life-giving power. 
People living in countries where there were seasonal 
droughts ascribed to water the power of a super- 
natural being. The Egyptians speak of the ‘‘spirit 
of water.’’ Thus, among various peoples, certain 
streams and lakes were set apart as sacred; rain cere- 
monials were used for the purpose of securing rain; 
water was used for healing and purifying purposes; 
offerings accompanied by religious ceremonies were 
made to propitiate the ‘‘spirit of water’’ in wells and 
streams, and holy waters have often been places of 
oracles and divinations. 
Is the Tendency to Play in Water Ingrained in 
Original Nature? — Several writers believe that a 
love of water is ingrained in original nature as the 
1F, E. Bolton: “Hydro Psychoses,” American Journal of 
Psychology, Vol. X.
-P-A-G-E-359
  PLAY WITH FIRE AND WATER 347 
result of man’s past history. For example, according 
to Bolton, as quoted by Thorndike, we find the 
following theory: ‘‘ This universal love for water seems 
not to be due to experience alone, for all babes exhibit 
it in their earliest days, if conditions are supplied. 
It seems partly instinctive and of more than recent 
philogenic (sic) origin, and at least suggests a survival 
of the old-time life in an aquatic medium. This is 
not demonstrable, but the weight of all testimony is 
in that direction. How else can we account for the 
passionate desire of children to paddle, to splash, ride 
on rafts, run out in the rain; for their intense delight 
in swimming, even going without meals, walking long 
distances, enduring severe punishments, etc., just for 
the sake of being in the water? Many of these 
characteristics are exhibited by adults when the 
conventionalities of civilized life can be thrown off.” ! 
To this argument Thorndike answers: ‘‘It is, in 
my opinion, probable that the love of paddling, 
wading, and swimming is wholly or in large measure 
due to the love of ‘doing something and having 
something happen as a result,’ and to the increased 
freedom of the body when fewer or more comfortable 
clothes are worn. Water is enjoyed in large measure 
for the same reasons that a sand pile, a roomful of 
toys, or a gymnasium is enjoyed.” » 
The writer’s observations of thousands of children 
in spontaneous play with water have led her to accept 
Thorndike’s view that enjoyment of water is in large

measure due to the love of ‘‘doing something and 
having something happen as a result.” 
How Children of Different Ages Play in Water. — 
It is interesting to observe the different ways in which 
children of varying ages respond to water. The 
child of three is satisfied at first to walk slowly and 
carefully in the shallow water, enjoying the ‘‘feel”’ of 
it on his feet. When he has had his fill of this, he 
begins to splash, laughing and jumping up and down 
in glee at the exhilaration which comes from this 
contact with the cool, resisting water. He takes great 
delight in filling tin buckets with water and emptying 
them again in the sand; in splashing water with his 
hands, or in pushing floating boards hither and 
thither with his hands and feet. But to the child of 
five or six years, this is tame play indeed. He likes to 
wade, spash, and jump in the deep water; to run 
and chase the other children; to throw balls and hoops; 
to tug at boards and ropes thrown into the water; 
and to float boats and craft of all kinds. The child of 
seven or nine years likes to do all this and still more. 
He wants to do things that appear to be difficult and 
dangerous; he is constantly daring his fellows to 
perform some new feat— to jump over ropes, to skip 
pieces of wood or stones, and to engage in such games 
as “Water Tag,” ‘“‘Tug of War,” and ‘‘Find the 
€oin:” 
Rural Life Affords Better Opportunity for Water- 
play than Does Urban Life. — Most children who live 
in rural communities have daily contact with small 
lakes, brooks, and creeks; here sand and water present 
wonderful opportunities for free play and constructive
-P-A-G-E-361
PLAY WITH FIRE AND WATER 349 
genius. What fun to walk barefoot along the hard 
sand at the water’s edge; to dig the toes deep into the 
wet sand; to draw pictures on the sand with a stick; 
to make deep wells and watch the water flow in and 
out with the coming and going of the waves; and to 
  AT THE SEASHORE 
dig deep ditches wide enough for sailboats to ply up 
and down! Or what joy to play daily in the little 
brook near home; to ford the narrow places; to build 
dams and locks; to make water wheels which will 
turn sand mills round and round; and to whittle boats 
which will sail majestically along the banks! Add to 
this the fun of wading on and on indefinitely, without

coming to the end of anything, and the country 
child’s joy of comradeship with water is complete. 
The city child, though far removed from streams 
and brooks, yet comes early into contact with water. 
Children invariably play with faucets; experimenting 
  CuttpreN Like To Pray AT THE WATER’S EpcE 
with the falling water, pouring it into and out of 
kitchen utensils, and producing crude waterfalls and 
fountains by using a sieve or by holding a hand over 
the faucet, thus splashing the water about the room. 
They like to use the garden hose, to sprinkle not only 
the grass and walks but also pedestrians and passing 
vehicles; to dart in and under the water; and they 
shout with glee when permitted to don a bathing suit

and test the force of the water on the feet, back, and 
chest. 
To the city child the streets and gutters on a rainy 
day afford great delight. School children splash 
merrily through puddles and small boys poke with a 
stick along the curbings and gutters. Wherever there 
are tubs or pails filled with water children gather about 
them, for they delight to splash stones in the water, 
to sail boats, to fill tin cans with water, and, if per- 
mitted, to throw water over each other's heads. 
Most civic agencies for recreation realize the appeal 
of water play, and provide wading pools, swimming 
tanks, and shower baths in the recreation parks and 
playgrounds. 
The Wading Pool: Its Construction and Use. — 
Country children need no wading pools, for in most 
rural communities sandy or rocky brooks, creeks, or 
streams entice children back to prehistoric amphibian 
contact with soil and water. City children of 
twenty years ago, if not fortunate enough to live near 
the water, were deprived of much pleasure and 
profitable experimentation. But to-day most cities 
have playgrounds, in many of which is a wading pool, 
that blessed substitute for the pebbly brook and the 
“old swimming hole.’’ Since most of the wading 
pools are circular in shape, with a drain in the center 
from which the water is usually emptied each day, 
permitting scrubbing of the cement bottom, there is 
little of the danger of contagion from sources of in- 
fection which make stagnant pools a constant menace 
to health. However, the cold cement is a poor 
substitute for mud or sand. Half of the enjoyment of
-P-A-G-E-365
  
PLAY WITH FIRE AND WATER 353 
wading comes from putting bare feet down in soft, 
yielding soil and at the same time reinforcing the 
exhilaration this contact affords with the stimulating 
effect of cold water on the skin. Then, too, the 
crowded cement wading pool gives a sense of physical 
limitation, for one’s movements must necessarily come 
in conflict with those of dozens of other children who 
have equal rights to enjoyment. It is also difficult to 
get the same enjoyment one experiences in roaming 
along the shores of a lake or aimlessly following the 
course of a brook. Yet there is the stimulating 
contact with the cool water. It is hard to explain the 
emotional contentment that contact with water affords 
the mind and body. Suffice it to say that some 
transformation of nerve cells occurs and that there 
results a physical relaxation, a sense of well-being, 
which defies analysis. 
One advantage, however, inheres in the circular pool 
fifty or sixty feet in diameter as compared with 
brooks and creeks. The larger area is shallow and 
permits even very young children some means of being 
initiated into the charm of contact with water, while 
their more venturesome brothers and sisters play 
contentedly near the center of the pool. Where the 
pool has no cement bottom, but is made by excavating 
the soil, and where the water is occasionally filtered 
away through a drain in order to supply fresh water 
and allow the rays of the sun to disinfect the sandy 
bottom, care should be taken that the children’s 
mouths, noses, and eyes do not become exposed to the 
water, which necessarily contains dust and carries 
infections. The feet alone are not liable to contagion

354 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
except from skin diseases, which are uncommon in 
early childhood. 
Toys and Materials Suitable for Play in Water. — 
It is not necessary to provide elaborate toys for chil- 
dren to use in the water. Wherever children are 
found playing in the water, they are observed to be 
using toys of their own construction. Bits of wood 
    Photographed for the Pittsburgh Bureau of Recreation 
THE PLAYGROUND FLEET 
become boats and are pushed about by means of 
sticks or are guided by the hands of the children them- 
selves. Boards become oars; the children sit down 
in the shallow water and propel themselves by means 
of these oars. Cork boats are among the most 
practicable for playground use; cork reefs and corn- 
cob crafts, though more difficult to construct, can 
easily be made by children from seven to nine years of 
age. Walnut and egg-shell craft and the tiny peanut-
-P-A-G-E-367
PLAY WITH FIRE: AND WATER 355 
shell boats furnish children genuine amusement. 
They are fragile and difficult to handle, and are 
always capsizing at unexpected times; yet they afford 
considerable merriment. When children are old 
enough to handle knives, boats may be whittled out 
of cigar boxes; a mast, a sail, or cannon can convert 
these boats into schooners, men-of-war, or super- 
dreadnaughts. 
Fishing plays require only a stick, a line, and a bent 
pin. The children sometimes cut fish from paper or 
cardboard, mount a steel hook through the fish, and 
with a tiny magnet in place of a hook, bait and catch 
the fish, which, mounted on corks, sail about on the 
water. These floating fish are infinitely more difficult 
to catch and require more skill than is demanded to 
catch the stationary ones supplied in the Magnetic 
Fish Pond game. Water wheels of various kinds are 
on the market, but left to himself any ingenious child 
can invent one and learn through using it the ele- 
mental facts concerning water power. 
For indoor water play the writer has made suc- 
cessful use of galvanized-iron trays made to fit any 
table desired and furnished with a drain pipe at one 
end. The water can thus be emptied easily into 
pails. This does away with the necessity of emptying 
the water by hand. Duck ponds are on the market; 
some of them are mere mechanical inventions by which 
ducks and swans float around for half an hour or until 
the mechanism runs down. Celluloid fish, ducks, 
and swans are attractive materials to add to the 
galvanized-iron tray mentioned above. They are more 
durable than the floating toys which children them-
-P-A-G-E-368
  356 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
selves invent. Seaplanes, balloons, and other aerial 
craft enhance the pleasure of play in the water. 
They can be manipulated by strings while the children 
wade about, and the seaplanes, at least, can be made 
to run smoothly over the water. Hoops, balls, and 
long boards are useful materials to provide for simple 
plays and games in the water. 
REcoRDS OF WATER PLAYS 
1. Wading Pools. Soho Moultrie Playground. — 
Boys banked walls of sand around the inner ledge of 
the sand box to form a wading pool. They then 
carried buckets of water from a neighbor’s pump and 
filled the pool with water. They enjoyed splashing 
in the muddy water with their bare feet. After the 
fun of this had worn off, they made crude boats out of 
pieces of wood and pushed these around the pool by 
means of sticks. 
2. Wading Pool. Junction Hollow Playground. — 
The children went occasionally to the Ormsby Park 
swimming pool and were always planning how they 
could have one of their own. Every time the super- 
visor appeared they told her of some new way in which 
a swimming pool could be built on their playground. 
As the playground was located in a small valley 
underneath a railroad bridge, the immediate fulfill- 
ment of their hopes did not seem probable. One day, 
however, they discovered how to make a pool for 
themselves. A small natural spring was in the 
location selected for the pool. The children cleaned 
up the surrounding ground and dug a pit about five 
feet wide around the spring; this soon filled up with 
 
-P-A-G-E-369
PLAY WITH FIRE AND WATER 357 
water and made a small pond in which they could 
wade. The day after the pool was finished, a mother 
brought three ducks and let them swim in the pool; 
this proved a great delight to the children. 
3. ‘The Old-Fashioned Bucket.’? Ormsby Park. — 
A group of children dug a well; they lined it with 
blocks molded together with damp sand. It sug- 
gested pictures of the ‘‘Old-Fashioned Bucket.’’ The 
children planned a frame similar to the one they had 
seen in the pictures. To do this they stood two sand 
shovels upright over the well and suspended a bucket 
tied by a string to another shovel used as a crosspiece. 
After filling the well with water the children took turns 
lowering the bucket and bringing it up full of water. 
This play lasted several days. 
4. Ponds. Arsenal Park. — Ponds were made by 
burying pails in the sand and filling them with water. 
Turtles, fish, ducks, and frogs were cut out of paper 
and mounted on milk-bottle tops. The children 
enjoyed floating these in the water. 
5. Flood. Arsenal Park.— One day a group of 
children dug a deep river channel in the sand, filled it 
with water, and floated boats down the river. They 
kept pouring in more water until the river overflowed 
and flooded the banks; then they knocked down the 
bridges and sank, or rescued, the boats. 
A thrilling dramatic play, constructive in purpose yet de- 
structive to material. 
6. New York Harbor. Sullivan Playground. — 
Some boys had seen pictures of New York Harbor. 
They planned to represent it in the sand. They 
made the bay and harbor, constructing ferry boats,
-P-A-G-E-370
  358 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
steamers, and rowboats to put in the harbor; along 
the banks of the harbor they laid out parks and 
palisades; out in the bay they added islands, forts, and 
the Statue of Liberty. 
7. Sailing Boats. Ormsby Park. — The children 
tunneled out a river to extend around the four sides of 
the sand box, filled the river with water, and construct- 
ed paper boats to float on it. These boats proving 
fragile, the children got some large, flat corks, and with 
thumb tacks attached paper sails. The wind was 
very strong and blew the boats here and there on the 
river. 
8. Fishing. Washington Park Playground. — In 
the playroom was a large galvanized-iron tray, just 
the size of the kindergarten table which it was made to 
fit. It was planned especially for water plays. The 
children converted this tray into a fishing pond. 
They made cardboard fish to which steel rings were 
attached. With an improvised pole and magnet 
they caught the fish. Sometimes they took the fish 
home on a string and cooked them for dinner; at other 
times they were satisfied to catch and land the fish. 
9. Boats and the Carrying Trade. Washington 
Park. — During a heavy rain, the outdoor sand pile 
became flooded with water. After the storm had 
subsided the boys dug river channels, using blocks for 
wharves and setting up tall buildings along the river. 
Next they made boats. One boy put a few sticks in 
his boat and said he was loading it with lumber, Then 
all the boys decided to have freight boats carrying} 
different things. They loaded the boats with wood, 
stone, and sand, going from dock to dock to dispose o

the cargo. Someone suggested having a trading place; 
so a number of stores were started, some for lumber, 
some for stone, and others for sand. The girls left 
their house plays to buy at the stores; some interesting 
bartering resulted. 
This is a splendid example of play where the dramatic goes 
hand in hand with constructive interest. The accidental sug- 
gestion of a lumber cargo started the chain of ideas resulting in the 
dramatic representation of the carrying trade. 
ro. Water Carnival. — Minerva Stern, in an article 
entitled ‘‘A Water Carnival,’’ published in the 
January, 1917, number of The Playground, describes 
an interesting carnival held on a wading pool. Each 
child came bringing his own boat, and, after getting 
his number, waded around the pool until the judges 
had made their decision. Then came various races in 
which the boats were grouped according to weight, 
size, and character. Finally the winners were lined 
up for the finals. Another race was run for balance; 
and it was discovered that many builders had failed to 
balance their boats carefully.

VISUAL EXPLORATION 
The Field of This Study Defined. — Having sur- 
veyed two divisions of movement play, namely, plays 
involving gross bodily control and manipulation, we 
shall now turn our attention to the field of visual 
exploration, our third division of movement plays. 
Here we encounter a wealth of playful experimentation 
connected with brightness, color, form, and perception 
of movement. Our purpose is to touch upon spon- 
taneous activities which reveal the scope of interest 
children have along this line and point out a natural 
procedure or “‘method’”’ for visual education. The 
importance of visual education has long been recog- 
nized, but its scope is hardly realized at the present 
time. A magazine called Visual Education is devoted 
to the publication of the results of experimental study 
in this field. 
The Development of the Eye in Childhood. — Any 
consideration of visual education brings home the 
important fact that the eye in early childhood is 
incompletely developed, underfocused, and poorly 
adapted for close work. But as the body approaches 
general maturity, the eye tends to become emme- 
tropic. It is safe to say that the eye, like the other 
sense organs of the normal child, does not change 
percetibly after the second or third year. How, then, 
do we account for improvement in perception of bright- 
363

ness, color, form, and movement? It is through the 
perfecting of new brain associations. For example, a 
one-year-old child sees a ball as something to mouth, 
handle, drop, and roll. He also associates some 
degree of brightness and color with it, but later he 
perfects all these ideas and associates new ideas with 
the old ones. Sense training then, so far as the eye is 
concerned, is a matter of making brain connections. 
The Effect of Light, Brightness, and Color on the 
Human Eye.— The human longing for light is so 
strong that from time immemorial we have used light 
as a symbol of divinity, a fact on which we have no 
time to dwell except to note the significance of the 
heavenly bodies and of fire in religion. 
The infant’s face takes on a satisfied expression 
when turned toward the light. In the second and 
third months his gaze clings to bright and shining 
objects. Differences in brightness are perceived at 
about six months, but color is not usually perceived 
until the second half of the first year. In the writer’s 
observations of her son she noticed that although his 
eyes rested with pleasure on colored bows suspended 
over his crib during the fourth, fifth, and sixth months, 
yet he gazed with almost equal satisfaction at yellow, 
blue, and red bows, at candle light, or at a pink 
afghan. This seems to indicate that degrees of 
brightness were unperceived by him until about the 
sixth month. 
Most authorities agree that colors are not perceived 
until the second half year. The consensus of opinion 
seems to be that most children display more interest 
in the warm colors, red and yellow, than in the colder
-P-A-G-E-377
  VISUAL EXPLORATION 365 
ones. Blue is perceived with greater difficulty than 
red and yellow, according to most investigators. 
Preyer says: ‘‘The inability of my two-year-old child 
to recognize blue and gray can be argued not only 
from his occasional failure to do so, but also from the 
evident difficulty he encounters in connecting the 
commonly used and familiar names ‘blue’ and ‘gray’ 
with any special sensations, while ‘yellow’ and ‘red’ 
were correctly applied several months ago. Were the 
sensations of blue and gray as clear as are red and 
yellow, there would be no failure to recognize the 
colors.’’! In the case of the writer’s son, at the fifth 
year gray and cold blues were perceived only in cases 
where memory associated the name with some article 
of clothing or a favorite toy. Even the color-blind, 
as Whipple points out, learn to recognize reds and 
greens by means of secondary criteria such as bright- 
ness and saturation and familiarity with the applica- 
tion of color nomenclature.2) Hence we cannot be 
sure that a child recognizes colors at a particular time 
without testing with a large number of colors of varied 
degrees of saturation and brightness. Applying this 
knowledge to this child’s apparent lack of perception 
of blue and gray, we conclude that he either failed to 
perceive these colors or, perceiving them, found them 
less attractive than the brighter hues; for whenever he 
was asked to point out colors in a sunset he invariably 
failed to mention gray or any blues except the bright- 
est hues of blue.

The Young-Helmholtz theory assumes that primeval 
man distinguished only the three primary colors, red, 
green, and violet. From these were derived orange 
and yellow, while blue was the very last to be dis- 
covered. Primitive tribes paint their bodies and 
color their ornaments almost exclusively with the 
warm colors. The cool colors are seldom seen in 
primitive ornamentation, even in combination with 
the warm colors. With savages as with children it is 
safer to assume that the cooler colors are less attrac- 
tive than that they are imperfectly perceived. Nature 
uses them profusely and civilized homes are decorated 
largely in neutral tints. 
Sex Differences in Perception of Color. — It is 
interesting to note that boys concern themselves less 
with color than do girls. Groos interprets this fact to 
indicate differences in training rather than in inborn 
capacity and points to the fact that the history of 
painting seems to show that the masculine sex has a 
finer color sense than the feminine.' He fails; how- 
ever, to mention the important parallel that the 
history of household arts shows that feminine interest 
in and appreciation of color extends far beyond the 
masculine. In conclusion, then, it appears that boys 
and girls have few differences in inborn capacities for 
color discrimination, but that their attention is direct- 
ed to different fields. 
Perception of Space. — As concerns perception of 
space, without entering into the controversy as to 
whether or not children have to learn by practice to 
respond appropriately to distance, we may safely 
1K. Groos: The Play of Man, pp. 59-60. 
 
-P-A-G-E-379
VISUAL EXPLORATION 367 
conclude that space perception for short distances, 
aided as it is by the adjustments of the hands and 
eyes, is earlier and more effectively developed than 
is color perception, which is dependent upon the eye 
alone. 
Children get their first ideas of form, as they do of 
space, by using the coéperative results of the hands, 
the eyes, and the kinesthetic sensations. The 
human face, the first oval, is at first to the child a 
mere patch of light connected with the comfort of 
being fed. The bottle gives early impressions of 
cylindrical shape. The ball registers impressions of 
sphericity to the hands closing in upon it. } 
Before the results of scientific investigations in 
perception of color and form were known, the early 
kindergarten tried to teach form through type shapes, 
namely, the ball, cube, and cylinder. A child was 
supposed, somehow, to carry over a knowledge of 
these three forms to a recognition of form in his environ- 
ment. For example, he was asked to see cylindrical 
characteristics in a stove-pipe, a vase, a whistle, or an 
engine. Procedure of this kind hindered real per- 
ception of form. It is more important that a child 
recognize a stove-pipe as such, than as having cylin- 
drical characteristics. To ask a child to see a cylinder 
in a stove-pipe is to demand that he eliminate accuracy 
of proportions from his perception of form and 
substitute fancy for truth. In psychological termin- 
ology it is asking him to reconstruct the image. 
Children have enough to do to learn to see accurately 
without being required to juggle their mental images 
in this fashion.

The Relative Importance of Perception of Form in 
Visual Education.— Groos makes the interesting 
statement that the visible form of objects is of higher 
biological value to the exceedingly important faculty 
of recognition than is color or brilliancy.1. Recogni- 
tion, the first requirement for reproduction, is natur- 
ally dependent on perception of form. However 
true this statement may be concerning the value of 
form in visual education, it seems more than probable 
that the early perception of form is indissolubly 
bound up with that of brightness and of color. 
Although there are no reliable data gathered from 
scientifically conducted tests to prove that little 
children show a preference for colored pictures, from 
the writer’s own experience in showing pictures to 
children it has appeared that children under three 
years of age can scarcely recognize the meaning of 
simple outline. On the contrary, a child of kinder- 
garten age has learned through secondary connections 
to associate form with simple outline. R came home 
from kindergarten one day exhibiting a series of crude 
lines which meant to him trees, soldiers, houses, and 
flowers. These lines stood for objects only because 
associations had been built up between lines and 
objects. 
The Natural Way to Learn Form. — Most children 
learn the fundamental characteristics of form before 
they go to school. While busy mothers work about 
the house, busy children finger and manipulate 
anything which responds to their purposes. And as 
they handle they learn how form lends itself to 
1K. Groos: The Play of Man, p. 60.
-P-A-G-E-381
  
VISUAL EXPLORATION 369 
locomotion and to construction. A classification of 
form from the child’s viewpoint would vary at 
different ages, but would center about the uses of 
objects. Round pie tins are recognized as better to 
spin and roll than oval ones; square pans can be built 
into houses; oblong tins can be used for street cars. 
Round baskets are seen not as parts of hollow spheres, 
but as containers. This incidental’ knowledge of 
form which the child gets in spontaneous play needs 
only to be made conscious to afford a basis for more 
intelligent recognition and appreciation of form in 
industry, art, and commerce. The mother or teacher 
needs but to direct the appreciation and classification 
of form along constantly progressive lines, and teach 
a suitable terminology. Many mothers unconsciously 
help their children to distinguish form through spon- 
taneous play with buttons, boxes, jelly glasses, pie 
tins, and blocks. Playing store, collecting nature 
specimens, as well as drawing, cutting, clay modeling, 
sewing, and carpentry work, all teach form in relation 
to life situations and reveal the characteristics of form 
in useful ways. The records show many cases where 
perception of form was perfected through such 
spontaneous play. 
Perception of Movement. — Passive enjoyment of 
motion is common throughout life. As soon as the 
eyes develop the power to follow moving objects, 
children exhibit an unlearned tendency to watch and 
enjoy motion. The infant follows the movements of 
people near him; his glance seeks out the undulating 
movements of flames, the wreaths of curling smoke 
blown from a pipe, water running from a faucet, or 
 
-P-A-G-E-382
  370 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
steam rising from a teakettle. When held at the open 
window he delights to gaze at falling rain, the whirling 
snowflakes, and trees and leaves blown by the wind, 
and to watch the swift movements of automobiles, 
street cars, and trains. Toys that move are early 
sought out and the movements of birds, insects, and 
animals seldom fail to challenge attention. 
The writer can remember the delight she ex- 
perienced in her childhood from watching the move- 
ments of the sand and water at the seashore. It was 
pleasurable to see the beating of the waves on the 
shore, the dashing of the breakers on the piers, the 
lapping of the water against the small craft moored in 
the harbor, and the circling of the sea-gulls over the 
water. On stormy days it was great fun to watch, 
from a sheltered place, less fortunate people hurrying 
to their homes; to follow with the eyes the course of 
scattering leaves and papers tossed about by the 
wind; and at rare moments to hear the crash of 
boughs lashed to the ground by the storm. 
Most adults share these interests with children. 
What a delight to watch the movements of throngs of 
skaters threading their passage over the ice; to con- 
template the merry whirl of dancers skimming 
lightly over a waxed floor; to watch the undulating 
movements of swimmers working their passage so 
gracefully through the water! What pleasure, too, to 
follow with the glance the swiftly rolling balls sent 
toward a goal or to watch the progress of tennis balls 
released from the racket, of arrows speeding upward, 
or the flight of the swiftly whirling discus! Adults 
enjoy watching the speeding of automobiles and horses 
 
-P-A-G-E-383
  VISUAL EXPLORATION 371 
along race tracks. There is more than the enjoyment 
of seeing physical skill in watching skillful acrobatics; 
there is pleasure in contemplating motion in and of 
itself. 
Method in Visual Education. — The records of play 
activities connected with brightness, color, form, and 
movement indicate some important considerations for 
more formal work in visual education and are therefore 
worthy of mention. In his play the child trains his 
eye to recognize colors and forms in situations useful 
to him as he works out purposes of his own. He uses 
a red glass window for his house of blocks, because he 
likes the color effect; but when he finds that he cannot 
see clearly into the interior of the house he is building, 
he substitutes a white window pane. He soon learns 
that cylindrical blocks make excellent rollers for toy 
vehicles; but when he tries to fashion a permanent 
toy, he discovers that wheels are more easily secured 
to the toy and serve his purpose better. In construc- 
tion, the child is not interested in trying out various 
materials for the sake of mere experimentation; he 
has some purpose to serve, some end to attain. The 
old type of sense training was to refine the senses. 
This seems to be Montessori’s position. Her didactic 
apparatus was calculated to serve the purpose of 
intellectual gymnastics. She seems little concerned 
with evidence for or against the transfer of training to 
situations useful in life. It seems extremely doubtful 
whether the children taught by her method to dis- 
criminate among geometrical forms would recognize 
those forms in their relation to constructive problems 
in machinery, sewing, or carpentry work, or whether
-P-A-G-E-384
  
372 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
their appreciation of art would profit by such exercises. 
On the contrary, it seems highly probable that a child 
who learned form through building with blocks, con- 
structing with boxes and paper, and through cutting 
and drawing would have learned about form in a useful 
way. The same may be said of training in color. 
It is what the child learns that counts, not how his 
senses are refined by so doing. 
In speaking of the didactic apparatus of Montessori 
and her method, Kilpatrick has the following to say: 
“Tt is true that any experience with color or form or 
weight helps to make one’s concepts of these things; 
and pleasurable experience along any one of these 
lines will lead the child tc look for further allied 
experiences. It is further true that growth comes 
from the organization of such experiences, and that 
this is the training that we really wish. In these 
ways exercise with this apparatus may be, indeed, 
will be, of service; because from it comes opportunity 
for the conscious consideration of such experiences. 
The formal and mechanical aspect of the training is, 
however, practically valueless.” ! 
RECORDS OF PERCEPTIONS OF COLOR AND 
OF BRIGHTNESS 
The following records show play situations in which 
perceptions in brightness, color, form, and movement 
are gained through spontaneous play: 
Twentieth day. “R’s eyes followed a moving 
lighted candle up and down, but not from left to 
right.” 
1W. H. Kilpatrick: The Montessori System Examined, pp. 50-51.
-P-A-G-E-385
   VISUAL EXPLORATION 373 
Twenty-third day. ‘‘R’s eyes followed a candle 
flame sideways once out of about every three trials.” 
Twenty-eighth day. ‘‘R seemed to enjoy gazing in 
the direction of the windows and the lighted gas 
grate. His gaze also seemed to cling repeatedly to a 
pink afghan thrown over a chair near his crib.” 
Forty-fourth day. ‘‘He gazed at a large mirror 
with interest.” 
Seventy-eighth day. ‘‘R’s gaze rested for several 
minutes at different times on a red tissue-paper bow 
suspended by a string from the wall near his crib. 
Several days later he looked with almost equal interest 
at yellow, blue, and violet bows.” 
Fourth month. ‘‘Three balls, red, yellow, and 
blue in color, were placed in a row in front of R. At 
first it seemed that he gazed less at the yellow ball 
than at the others, but when the position of the balls 
was changed several times, it was discovered that he 
looked more frequently at the extreme left ball, 
regardless of color.’ 
Seventh month. ‘One cloudy day I turned on 
the electric light. R noticed the difference in bright- 
ness at once and looked around, then up to the lighted 
dome. His gaze returned to the dome again and 
again.” 
Eighth month. ‘‘R likes especially well to see the 
flames spring out when I touch a match to the gas 
grate.”’ Mere color and brightness are not the only 
attraction; fire brings an appeal of its own. 
Fourteenth month. ‘Several rolls of crépe paper, 
red, orange, blue, and violet, were placed before R ina 
row. He seized red first, then orange, then blue.    
    
-P-A-G-E-386
  374 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
An hour later the same colors were arranged differ- 
ently before him. He reached for orange, red, blue, 
in order named, then held the orange for a consider- 
able period. A third time the rolls of colored paper 
were laid before him. He crept past the red and blue 
rolls to reach the orange one.” 
Fifteenth month. ‘From red, orange, violet, and 
blue, R chose orange. From red, orange, violet, 
and white R chose violet.”’ 
Eighteenth month. ‘‘The same four rolls of paper 
were laid on the floor. R picked them up one at a 
time and threw each down on his other side. He then 
picked up the orange roll and manipulated it. A 
few days later R chose red and orange from the four 
colors. Later in the same day he chose orange and 
violet. R is apparently at this time partial to 
orange as a color.” 
Four years and two months. ‘R was playing with 
the buttons in my button box. He said, ‘here’s a 
mahogany button. This one is gold.’ I nodded 
approval, saying, ‘Find a blue one.’ R picked out a 
dark blue button. ‘Yes! that is navy blue,’ I said; 
‘Find a light blue one.’ .R picked out a bright blue 
button, either not recognizing the meaning of light 
blue, or not perceiving the color.” ! 
Playing with Colored Glass.— The writer spent 
many happy hours, when a child, playing with samples 
of bright transparent and translucent glass. In the 
pure white sand so abundant near the shore, the 
squares of glass gleamed forth like precious stones. 
1 All these examples are selected from the author’s unpublished 
records. 
 
-P-A-G-E-387
  VISUAL EXPLORATION 375 
Glass houses and church windows were built and 
rebuilt. It was fun also to look through the glass at 
houses, trees, and people; not only were the color 
effects interesting, but the objects viewed obliquely 
through the glass took on variations of form and 
changed in perspective. 
It would be easy to guide such playful experimentation along 
lines of scientific inquiry in which the cause of refraction and laws 
controlling it are spontaneously discovered by children. 
Treasuring Bits of Cloth. — Children collect pieces 
of bright silk, velvet, and satin, treasuring them care- 
fully. Most children enjoy the ‘‘feel”’ of silks, satins, 
and velvets so that color is not the only factor here. 
Blowing Soap Bubbles. — Who has not gazed with 
delight at a group of children blowing soap bubbles 
in the sunshine and watched their eager faces light up 
with pleasure when the golden bubbles sail majestic- 
ally upward, or break into myriads of shining stars 
before the perilous journey downward is completed? 
Each bubble acts as a reflector, producing many 
colors of the rainbow.. 
Experimenting with a Prism. The Light Bird. — 
Sooner or later every child discovers for himself 
bright spots thrown on the wall, floor, or ceiling of a 
room by the refraction of light through a prism or 
mirror. ‘‘One day when R was a little more than a 
year old he sat so unusually still for several moments 
that I looked in the direction of his gaze and dis- 
covered he was pleasantly engaged in watching a 
dancing spot of light on the wall.’’! In Froebelian 
kindergartens the children call this refracted light 
1 From the author’s unpublished records.
-P-A-G-E-388
    
376 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
“the Light Bird” and often try to catch it, running 
hither and thither in its quest, only to discover that 
their eyes alone can catch and hold their pretty 
plaything. 
The Rainbow. — The rainbow invariably calls from 
children responses of delight. Many children are 
observed to gaze spellbound by the riotous, sensuous 
appeal of so many colors. The rainbow is, of course, 
a common example of reflected and refracted light. 
Experimenting with Vegetable Colors Obtained 
from Roots, Barks, Leaves, and Berries. — The 
writer has seen children who were playing drug store 
go to considerable trouble to make colors to represent 
various ‘‘drugs’’ which they displayed in bottles. 
With a few suggestions concerning the action of salt, 
alum, and baking soda as mordants or to produce 
changes of color, many chemical experiments can be 
performed by children. The results are pleasing and 
satisfying. For example, the husks of walnuts or 
butternuts make brown. Brown can also be made 
from coffee, tea, or onion. Grape skins and purple 
cabbage make violet. Pokeberries make a red violet 
and cranberries a red or old rose. Nasturtium or 
tomato leaves can be used for green. 
RECORDS OF PERCEPTION OF FORM 
Eleventh month. ‘‘R discovered that cylinders 
roll and learned how to roll them to me by pushing 
them away from himself.’ 
“While rolling an embroidery hoop, R accidentally 
learned that a certain method of throwing with a high 
arm movement induced spinning. He repeated the
-P-A-G-E-389
  VISUAL EXPLORATION 377 
act several times. Here were perception of form and 
enjoyment in contemplating motion voluntarily pro- 
duced.” 
“R tried to pick up the spots in the linoleum pat- 
tern.” 
“R fits a small cylindrical box in a larger cylindrica! 
box and says ‘gone’ when he can not pull it out.’ 
“Whenever R is left free to do what he pleases in 
the kitchen, he goes directly to the cupboard and 
takes the lid off the double boiler, then tries to fit it 
on the various-sized utensils near by. He has never 
been observed to fit a round lid on a square tin or vice 
versa.” 
“One interesting feature of R’s perception of form 
in objects is his growth in ability to perceive the uses 
of objects in relation to their size and shape.. He 
places small dolls in boxes, and has been observed to 
note variations in the same shape in fitting together 
such objects as boxes, pans, and jelly glasses.”’ 
“R learned to spin an oval tin as well as a round 
one.”” 
Thirteenth month. ‘“R is pleased to take corks 
out of bottles and put them back again. Given 
three glass bottles with stoppers of different sizes, 
he will devote himself for a considerable period to 
fitting the stoppers in the right bottles. Here 
pleasure in manipulation is the chief enjoyment. 
Mistakes are self-corrective, since only the right 
stopper will fit each bottle.” 
“Given a nest of blocks, R did not at first discover 
how to fit all into a nest. He placed only two 
together.”
-P-A-G-E-390
  378 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
“R fits together four stew pans of various sizes, 
each size in its proper place.’ 
“R attempts to arrange clothespins in a row over 
the edge of a box. Here some esthetic appreciation 
of regularity of form is noticeable.” 
Fourteenth month. ‘‘R appeared to be gazing into 
a hand mirror which chanced to lie on the flaor 
beside him. Presently he looked again and laughed. 
I wondered if he was amused at the grotesqueness of 
the image. He reinforced this belief on my part by 
holding the mirror perpendicularly and gazing in- 
tently into it. In all probability he nottced the 
reflection of other objects besides himself.’ + 
1. Distorting Mirrors. — Gazing at images of 
themselves in the bowls of silver spoons, in glass 
globes, and in crystals is a favorite occupation of 
children. Great glee greets the abnormalities of form 
and features thus produced. Recreation agencies 
have seized upon this spontaneous interest. Amuse- 
ment resorts present crystal palaces where the 
principle of spherical aberration in convex and 
concave mirrors is worked out for the purpose of 
getting unusual and startling effects. People become 
suddenly thin or fat and great merriment results. 
The interest in spherical mirrors might extend to 
embrace an understanding of the ‘industrial uses of 
reflected light, examples of which are searchlights, 
lighthouses, and the headlights of locomotives. 
2. Double or Triple Mirrors. — Many children 
play with double hand mirrors, or gaze into the triple 
mirrors of dressing-tables. Here the reflecting sur-

faces form an angle. The children notice that several 
images can be seen at once in the triple mirrors; three 
when the mirrors are at right angles; more when the 
angles are less than right angles. 
3- Looking at Reflections in the Water. — Chil- 
dren enjoy bending over wells, ponds, and streams to 
see the inverted images of themselves reflected in the 
water. They soon notice that trees and houses at 
the water’s edge appear to be upside down in the 
water and that poles resting obliquely in the water 
look broken. They also note that the depth of a 
pond or stream appears different according to their 
distance from the water. 
4. Shadow Pictures and Shadowgraphs. — What 
child cannot remember the delight of shadow chasing! 
Many children, too, learn to make shadow pictures 
on the walls: rabbits, bears, wolves, elephants, and 
tigers chase each other across the sheet in rapid 
succession. Half of the interest in shadow pictures 
comes from passive enjoyment of the movements of 
the forms created and pleasure in being a cause. 
Lions can be made to roar and stalk, tigers crouch 
ready to spring, and kittens dart after their prey. 
This interest has been commercialized through shadow- 
graphs. The shadowgraph set consists of punched- 
out cards on which designs are lithographed in colors. 
The light shining through produces pictures on the 
wall. 
5. The Stereoscope.!— This instrument is com- 
monly used in schools and homes. It is an optical 
device by which two lenses give the appearance of life 
1See W. B. Forbush: The Manual of Play, pp. 327-328.

  380 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
proportions to objects, persons, and scenery. Add to 
this the effect of perspective and roundness of contour, 
and it is readily perceived how children delight in 
this instrument, also what splendid educational oppor- 
tunities it has for broadening the scope of such school 
subjects as geography, history, and botany. 
6. Multiple Pictures. — When children look into a 
thick mirror, they notice several images of a near by 
light or candle. This is because the front surface of 
the mirror and the metallic surface at the back act as 
parallel reflectors. 
7. The Kaleidoscope. — What joy most children 
derive from looking at the beautiful figures in the 
kaleidoscope! By looking through a tube containing 
three mirrors extending its entire length, the children 
see geometrical patterns of ground pieces of colored 
glass which are loosely placed between ground glass 
and a plate of clear glass parallel to it. 
8. The Camera. — Nearly every child desires to 
own a camera. The problems involved here are too 
intricate to be included in this book. 
RECORDS OF PERCEPTIONS OF MOVEMENTS 
1. The Edison Home Kinetoscope.!— Children 
who are fortunate enough to possess this scientific toy 
can have motion picture exhibitions in their own 
homes. Small rolls of films are used and the light is 
turnished by a small acetylene generator. 
2. The Radiopticon or Postcard Picture Machine. 
—— By means of this machine, ordinary post cards 
and pictures can be reflected enlarged upon a sheet.

CHAPTER XXIV 
EXPERIMENTATION WITH SOUND 
The Scope of This Study Defined. — The field 
connected with experimentation in sound is so vast 
that it will be possible to touch upon only two or 
three phases. Babbling and voice play have been 
purposely omitted while spontaneous experimentation 
with sounds and noises, also with toys producing 
acoustic effects, have been selected for emphasis. 
Groos’ Theory of Sound Play. — In speaking of the 
tissue hunger for sound on the part of the sensory 
organism, Groos says: “It seems that, in order to 
maintain our present life, an incessant rain of outer 
stimuli must beat upon us, like the atomic storm 
which many believe pours constantly upon the 
heavenly bodies and accounts for gravitation. * * * 
This may be why children are so indefatigable in 
making noises, patting their hands, cracking their 
knuckles, snapping and drumming with the fingers, 
stamping and beating with the feet, dragging sticks 
about, cracking and slamming doors, beating hollow 
objects, blowing in keys, banging on trays, clinking 
glasses, snapping whips, and, in short, delighting in 
tearing and smashing noises generally. And adults 
are not much behind them. These same sounds in 
other forms please us too, as for example the clinking 
of spurs, snapping a riding whip, rattling sabres, the

tinkling of tassels and fringes, the rustle of flowing

Experimentation with Sound.— The child’s first 
experimentation with sound comes through a rec- 
ognition of the noises and sounds going on about 
him. Music soothes him in his cradle, toys squeak, 
birds sing, bells ring, whistles blow, and animals utter

-P-A-G-E-395
  EXPERIMENTATION WITH SOUND 383 
their characteristic sounds, while people talk, whistle 
and sing. The writer can testify from her own 
records of one child’s natural responses to objects 
yielding acoustic effects. Before R was a month old 
he was easily quieted when crying by listening to 
piano music or the ticking of a watch held near his 
ear. As soon as he could tear paper the noise pro- 
duced in this way seemed particularly pleasurable. 
Ability to grasp and to control his arm movements 
made the shaking of rattles and pounding and clapping 
with his hands enjoyable. The noise produced by 
pounding on the glass doors of the bookcase was so 
pleasurable that he persisted in this activity even 
when punished for so doing. He particularly liked 
pounding with a spoon on tin lids and dishes, rattling 
dishes about, and pounding wood with a glass bottle; 
and if not watched he would attempt to pound on 
marble with a bottle. On his first birthday he was 
given a drum. He was not satisfied with the noise 
produced by beating it with a drumstick, but tried 
other effects by beating the drum softly or loudly 
with his hands, or by striking it with a bottle, a spoon, 
or an egg-shaped darning ball. When he heard 
piano music, he often responded instantly by jumping 
up and down in his high chair, sometimes also by 
beating against the chair with his hands and feet. 
He liked shaking keys, striking a tap bell, and ringing 
sleigh bells. In fact, he enjoyed making any noises 
possible to make by hitting and pounding. At thir- 
teen months he sometimes struck a note softly on the 
piano, although then, as earlier, pounding on the 
piano loudly with both hands was his chief delight.
-P-A-G-E-396
  384 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
About the same time he discovered that by inserting 
one end of a steel strip between the rails of his play 
pen he could vibrate it and produce a buzzing sound. 
This was one of his favorite plays for several weeks. 
The Physiological Foundations of Appreciation of 
Sound. — All this stimulation and appreciation of its 
meaning is an important part of education in infancy 
and childhood. The impression of each sound is 
transmitted by ‘the proper nerve to the brain and is 
there recognized. And so, in children’s early bab- 
bling, certain chance variations in sound are more 
pleasing than others and are noticed by eager parents 
who encourage their children to reproduce them. 
Thus they are perceived and felt more vividly and are 
developed for use in connection with the speaking or 
singing voice. Such a conscious and willed reproduc- 
tion of sound represents real achievement in the 
development of the mind-ear. There is in the mind 
an image of these sounds and this image persists and 
motivates the reproduction of the sound on a certain 
pitch, and with a certain intensity, duration, and 
stress. To reproduce these tone effects accurately 
the whole vocal apparatus — the lungs, the muscles 
surrounding them, the vocal cords, tongue, palate, 
and maxillary muscles— must be set in motion. 
The mind-ear also judges the result and the child 
repeats a tone or sound until desired effects are 
gained, or until satisfied by the activity itself. 
Development of Apprehension of Music.—The mere 
recognition of isolated musical sounds or of noises does 
not necessarily lead to musical appreciation. So 
long as this tone is unrelated to other tones in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-397
   EXPERIMENTATION WITH SOUND 385 
mind we have not musical thought. It is only whena 
series of musical sounds is grouped in rhythmical units 
and these groups of sound are harmoniously perceived 
that musical thought may be said to exist. The faculty 
of hearing, of listening, so as to make sense of what is 
heard requires steady and systematic cultivation during 
the same years that the eye is being trained in count- 
less ways to see and perceive accurately. It is a com- 
monplace to suggest that the ear requires training 
during its period of greatest sensitivity. It is prior to 
the fourteenth year that the child’s nervous system 
is the most responsive tosound and rhythm. 
Musical Appreciation. — It will be impossible to 
more than refer to the wide, new experimentation 
having for its object musical appreciation as distinct 
from performance. A number of phonograph com- 
panies are conducting experiments in connection with 
records, trying out different systems in practice 
centers. The following range of experimentation is 
perhaps typical of the new lines of development. 
The author says:      
       The following ways for arousing curiosity and directing interest 
have proved very successful in the experiments: 
(x) By selecting a poem or story that is believed to be in a 
mood parallel to the music; thus stimulating the curiosity of the 
listeners to hear how nearly the literary mood suggests the music 
mood. 
(2) By directing the attention of the listeners to music through 
their knowledge of marching, dancing, e 
(3) By suggesting that the music may be used in pantomime or 
interpretative dancing. m" 
(4) By suggesting that the music is in the same mood as a 
picture, either shown or described. 
     
                
       
  
-P-A-G-E-398
  386 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
(5) By presenting a problem, for instance: two poetic selections 
with one musical selection. After studying the mood in each 
selection, play the record and have the listeners decide which they 
think the music fits the better; or by reversing the process and using 
two selections of music with one poetic selection.! 
Acoustic Playthings. — Children, like savages, show 
extraordinary cleverness in fashioning crude musical 
implements. With savages the impulse to make 
musical instruments arises largely from their desire 
to accentuate dance-rhythms, and incidentally to add 
new methods of experimentation in imitating the 
sounds suggested by nature or by voice play. With 
children, pleasure in manipulating materials in such 
a way that musical sounds are produced is sufficient 
to account for the large numbers of ingeniously 
fashioned clappers, whistles, drums, and stringed 
instruments we find among children’s original toys. 
Musical Toys to be Struck or Shaken. — This 
group of toys may correspond to such musical instru- 
ments as the drum, the gong, the tom-tom, the 
triangle, bells, the hammer, the tuberphone, and the 
tambourine. The child invents his own rattles by 
filling boxes with stones, gravel, or sand. Jingles are 
made of bunches of pebbles or bones. Clappers of 
wood or bone are frequently made and castanets are 
made of shell and metal. Drums are invented by 
stretching a piece of cloth or leather over gourds, a 
hollowed piece of wood, or a metal dish. These 
drums are struck either by the hands or by sticks. 
Gongs are made from stone or wood and are sometimes 
arranged in sets to produce contrasting sounds. 
1L. Mohler: “Music Moods,” Educational Bulletin, Columbia 
Graphophone Company. 
 
-P-A-G-E-399
    EXPERIMENTATION WITH SOUND 387 
Many children learn to play crude tunes on pans or 
glass goblets filled with water. They soon discover 
how to produce varying sounds by altering the 
amount of water in the goblets or the nature of the 
stick they use for striking. 
Toy Stringed and Wind Instruments.— Spontaneous 
plays with so-called wind instruments are almost as 
numerous as with beaten ones. Children blow on 
grasses or willow whistles, thus producing shrill and 
startling sounds. Playing tunes on combs is a favorite 
pastime. Experimentation with a tin horn or roll 
of paper often leads the youthful inventor to produce 
a megaphone; if he lives on a ranch, natural horns are 
converted into trumpets. It is but a step to the 
invention of the traditional ‘‘Pipe of Pan,’’ made 
of reeds, grasses, wood, or stone, and with no hole 
to finger or reed to set in vibration. Most children 
stop at this point, although a few go so far as to 
learn that the principle of producing sound’ through 
a pipe is to set the air within into vibration by allow- 
ing a stream of air from the mouth to strike the 
edge of the pipe, or by using a vibrating tongue 
or reed. The children who have constructed crude 
wind instruments are quick to grasp the principles of 
sound-making illustrated by the flute, the clarinet, 
and the trombone. 
An introduction to stringed instruments often comes 
through playful experimenting. Boys who work 
with metal discover that they can produce musical 
sounds from thin strips of metal fastened securely in a 
vise. Drawing a bow across a partly filled glass of 
water also produces pleasant tones. Someone has said 
       
                  
    
    
-P-A-G-E-400
   
  388 SPONTANEOUS AND SUPERVISED PLAY 
that thrumming with the hand on a bowstring may 
first have suggested musical sound to the ears of the 
caveman. The child gets his introduction to the 
harp type oftenest by stretching cord tightly over a 
shallow wooden box. He varies this by adding a 
series of catgut strings of different length or mass 
and plucking them with a piece of wood, metal, or 
ivory. The number of strings varies from one or two 
upward, though the weakness of the framework usually 
limits both number and tension. Many boys enter- 
tain themselves for hours by plucking the strings of a 
home-made banjo or guitar. They soon learn that 
even in the simplest of these stringed instruments the 
air within the box acts as a resonator. For the same 
reason a teacup or a sea shell held to the ear emits 
sounds which seem to the ear to resemble the roar of 
the sea. 
Echo Plays. — Echo plays may well be included 
under acoustic effects spontaneously produced by 
children even though the agency is the human voice. 
Most children can remember the pleasure derived 
from shouting loudly near steep hills, tall piles of 
lumber, or high buildings, and hearing the sound 
come back again. Children who travel notice the 
strange and unusual echoes which occur between the 
parallel walls of deep canyons. Boys out hunting 
experience aerial echoes when they hear the sound of a 
gun gradually rolling off in the distance. At amuse- 
ment parks there are whispering galleries into which 
children are often taken. When they whisper softly 
on one side the sound may be heard distinctly at some 
distant point because of the curved walls.

The Toy Orchestra. —So many of the results of 
experimentation with children’s toy orchestras have 
been published in educational magazines and musical 
journals that it seems unnecessary to explore the 
possibilities of the toy orchestra in this study of 
spontaneous sound play. 
The writer includes a selected list of descriptions of 
various experiments in connection with the many-sided 
efforts to give children musical appreciation.

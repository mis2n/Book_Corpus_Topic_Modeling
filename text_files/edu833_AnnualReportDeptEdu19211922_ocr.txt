; i 
The Department of Education presents the following report for the bien- 
nial period between July 1, 1920 and June 30, 1922. * 
Since the meeting of the Legislature in 1921, Tennessee has, because of — 
the far-reaching and fundamental laws passed concerning education, made — 
substantial progréss along many lines. 
A discussion of some of the outstanding achievements follows. 
ScHooL FINANCES 
The uneven distribution of taxable wealth has imposed upon the State — 
the necessity for a revision of its methods of financing the public school 
system. Of necessity the State must give liberal support to the 
financially poor counties. To fail to lend this aid would be to deny schools 
  to these children, and would result in the depopulation of the rural counties, — 
-the destruction of their wealth and the impoverishment of the State. 
According to the official records of 1922, Hamilton County has a per capita 
wealth of $4,159 for each child between the ages of six and twenty-one; 
Madison County, the median county, has $1,491; Pickett County has $648. 
Hamilton County would be required to levy 11 cents on the $100 assessed 
valuation of property to produce $5.00 per child of school age, while Pickett ~ 
County would be required to levy 77 cents on the $100 assessed valuation of 
property to produce $5.00 per child of school age. Levying the same tax in 
each of these counties for school purposes, Hamilton would be able to run her 
schools 7 times as long, or pay her teachers an annual salary 7 times as great 
as Pickett County. 
If Pickett County should levy a tax sufficient to meet the average amount 
spent per child of school age for rural elementary education in Tennessee 
($9.33), it would require a county elementary school tax of $1.50 on the $100 
assessed valuation of property. This rate, of course, would be prohibitive. 
Under the Acts of 1921, the following method of apportioning the State 
elementary school fund is provided: 
1. $6,000 to all counties of the State whose county court levies a county 
elementary school tax sufficient to produce $5.00 per child of school 
age. Ifa minimum of 30 cents county elementary tax does not pro- © 
duce $5.00 per child, said county will receive the $6,000, provided every 
school in the county is run for at least 100 days term. This 30 cents 
county elementary tax is exclusive of the 14 cent state elementai 
school tax, which is collected and retained in the county where co 
lected, nor does it include the 8 cent State elementary school tax. 
2. The remainder of the elementary school fund is distributed on the 
basis of the average daily attendance in the several counties of bee 
State. 
3. Under the same Act the State Legislature levied an additional 3 cent 
- elementary school tax on the $100 assessed valuation of property, to 
be collected and paid into the State treasury, and to be apportioned 
on the basis of $2,000 equally to all counties, and the remainder to be 
apportioned to the several counties on the basis of average daily 
attendance in the public elementary schools. 
      
 
-P-A-G-E-18
Seopgee!     It will be seen from the above that the law governing the apportionment of 
school funds has a three-fold purpose: 
1. A county must make a minimum county levy for elementary schools 
before receiving the $6,000. Ninety-two of the ninety-five met this 
requirement for the year ending June 30, 1922. 
2. The county must run all of its schools for a term of at least one 
hundred days. Striking evidence that the school laws passed by the 
last Legislature are responsible for an increase in the rural elementary 
school term is seen in the fact that only one county in the State, for 
the school year ending June 30, 1922, had a rural elementary school 
term of less than one hundred days. For the preceding school year 
ending June 30, 1921, fourteen counties had a rural elementary term 
of less than one hundred days. - Five of these fourteen counties had 
a rural school term of only ninety days, and nine a school term of 
eighty days or less.’ 
3. The county’s share in the remainder of the State elementary school 
_ fund is conditioned upon the average daily attendance in all schools. 
The State school fund is returned to the counties for the purpose of 
extending the school term, and increasing the salaries of teachers, that the 
counties may have better schools. But this is not always the case. Some 
counties receiving a liberal share of State school funds have not increased 
their school term, as was rightfully expected A few counties have run their 
schools for the usual five or six months, and have diverted the remainder of 
_ the funds to building purposes. Whereas, had these counties matched 
the State fund dollar for dollar, an eight-months’ term would have been 
realized for their children. 
It is, therefore, recommended that the school law be so amended that no 
part of the State school funds, or of the county school funds collected by taxes ~ 
levied for maintenance purposes shall be used for other than meeting the — 
expenses incident to the operation of the schools. Further, that funds for 
buildings, sites and equipment be provided for by special levy or by means 
of bond issue. 
        The State, counties, and municipalities will collect and disburse for edu-_ 
_ cational purposes this year about $18,000,000, of which 97% is to be administereq 
by the local school authorities. The State has no check on this fund except in 
case any part is lost or stolen. TheState Superintendent isclothed with au- | 
_ thority to employ an attorney to institute proceedings for the recovery of such | 
funds. Said attorney receives 10% of the amount recovered for his services_ | 
Thelaw provides that the school funds shall be kept separate from all other funds 
_ This law is violated in many counties. School funds are used in payment of 
general county debts. The loss to the schools on account of loose handling of © 
funds cannot be estimated. Incompetence in bookkeeping, rather than 
_ criminal intent, is responsible for much of the delinquency in public office. 
a It is recommended that provision be made for the employment of an au— 
ditor to work under the direction of the State Superintendent of Public In— 
struction in checking the financial and statistical records of the county 
trustee, the county superintendent and the county board of education. It ig 
believed that such an official would save to the State many times his salary . 
    
   
-P-A-G-E-19
   
  Computsory SCHOOL ATTENDANCE LAW 
The apportionment ofthelarger part of the State elementary school fund 
upon the basis of the average daily attendance in all schools, has had a most 
wholesome effect upon county officials in respect to the enforcement of the 
Compulsory School Attendance Law. 
Comparing the total average daily attendance for the wchoeeee year. 
ending June 30, 1922 with that of the preceding year, it was found that the 
total increase in elementary school attendance was only slightly larger than — 
the increase that was known to have taken place in Davidson County alone. 
In order to get at the truth of the situation, a list of the counties has been 
arranged according to the percent of scholastic population which they had 
in school in 1920-21. It was found that, with the exception of only one county 
the twenty counties, reporting the highest percent in average daily attendance — 
for 1920-21, have shown tremendous losses for the year 1921-22. The aver- 
age loss in these twenty counties would amount to 26 percent of last year's soy 
attendance, or 18.5 percent of their scholastic population. 
With the extra incentive which the new law affords for keeping children 
in school, it seems impossible that one-fourth of the children in these counties. 
should have dropped out of school in one year. Indeed, some of these twenty 
counties have reported in newspaper articles that their attendance during 
1921-22 was greater than during 1920-21. It is to be noted, also, that the 
reports in 1921 were not sworn to, as was the case the past year, hence it is 
highly probable that these twenty county reports were incorrect. Excluding 
them from the computation, it is found that few of the remaining counties 
have varied more than 5 percent in the proportion of scholastic population 
which they have in school. These seventy-five counties show a net increase _ 
in average daily attendance of 33,433 despite the fact that fourteen of them ~ 
lost in attendance. We assume that, considering the great losses in the first 
twenty counties and the improbability, such a loss occurred at all, that 
not only did they fail to lose, but that if correct reports had been submitted 
for the scholastic year 1920-21 they, also, would have shown cals in the same 
_proportion as the other counties. 
In the seventy-five counties whose reports for 1920-21 appear to be re- 
liable, it was found that 8 percent of this year’s average daily attendance 
represents an increase. Applying this percentage to the first twenty counties, 
we get an increase of 7,202. This amount, added to the 33,433 as above, 
makes a total increase of 40,625. It is believed that this estimate is very 
conservative. 
    
     
        
ScHooLt TERM 
The length of school term is a vital factor in any school system. _ 
The elementary course of study for Tennessee is divided into eight grades, 
which requires eight school terms of eight months each, or sixty-four months, s 
for its completion. 
The cities and the larger counties run their schools for nine months, and 
are thus enabled to introduce more supplementary workand todo the whole 
year’s work in a more satisfactory way. 
It is not reasonable to assume that a child in a rural school can do as much 
work in five months as the average child in the large county or city system 
can do in eight or nine months. On the basis of sixty-four months for the
-P-A-G-E-20
—20— 
completion of the elementary school course, it will require thirteen years for 
the child who has the privilege of only a five-months term to complete his 
eight grades. Entering school at the age of six, he would be nineteen when 
he completes the elementary school course. While in the county having an 
eight-months term, the elementary course will be completed in eight years, 
and a child entering at the age of six will complete the elementary course at 
fourteen, and will have completed his high school course and one year in 
college by the time the child having only a five-months term can complete 
the elementary course. 
The short school term affects the county in another very vital way. 
Teachers who have invested time and money in professional training and who 
expect to make teaching their life’s work, rightly expect employment for full 
time at a salary commensurate with the capital invested in preparation for 
their work. The county running a short term pays an average annual salary 
of $200.00 to $400.00. The county having a longer term pays an annual salary 
of $600.00 to $1,000.00. This difference in salary is largely responsible for 
the drift of the teachers, who have acquired educational efficiency, from the 
smaller counties having a short term to the larger counties with a longer term. 
As a result the small rural counties that have a short school term and pay low 
annual_salaries experience difficulty in securing and holding teachers thor- 
oughly equipped for the duties of the class room. 
County Boarp or EDUCATION 
Gratifying results have been secured in the management and operation of 
the schools under the new county board of education law enacted by the 
General Assembly during its 1921 session. 
In most cases the men elected to the county board of education are persons 
of known business ability and integrity, and are conscientiously striving to 
administer the school affairs of their counties in the best interests of the 
children. 
Despite the fact that when the new county boards of education came into 
office the school indebtedness was larger than ever known before, the rural 
elementary school term ending June 30, 1922, shows an increase of ten days _ 
over the rural elementary school term of 119 days for the school year ending | 
June 30, 1921. 
It is confidently believed that the county school systems are being more — 
economically and efficiently administered under the new system of adminis- — 
tration than ever before in the history of the State. 
THe County SUPERINTENDENT ‘ 
The progress in education in any county is determined in a very large — 
measure by the county superintendent. He should be a person of broad | 
scholarship, special training and successful experience in class-room work, and — 
should have had training in school supervision and administrative practices, 
Aside from his professional training, the superintendent should be a person 
of business ability. He should know the resources of his county and its © 
ability to _pay for education. The large sums of school money expended on 
warrants drawn by the county superintendent demands a knowledge of 
_ methods of school accounting.    
     i}
-P-A-G-E-21
  calles 
The General Assembly of 1921 passed a law which provides that the State 
shall supplement the salary of the county superintendent with an amount 
equal to that paid by the county, provided that no county shall receive more 
than $1,000 in any year, and that no county shall receive any part of the fund 
unless it pay the county superintendent at least $500 exclusive of State sup- 
plement; provided, further, that any county superintendent receiving State 
aid shall devote all his time to the duties of his office. 
The result has been increased efficiency in all counties, for never before 
has the superintendent been required to devote his entire time to the duties 
of his office. More interest has been taken in school by the patrons and 
taxpayers, school attendance has improved, a higher standard has been set 
for the teachers, and many other commendable improvements noted. 
Yet the average salary paid the county superintendent is too meager to 
attract the best school men and women. The term of office is so brief that 
not even the best trained superintendent has time in which to lay out an 
educational program and put it into successful operation before the expira~ 
tion of his term. The law should be changed so that the county superin- 
tendent would be elected by the county board of education for a term of from 
three to five years at a salary that would appeal to the most efficient men and 
women of the teaching profession. The standard of qualification for the 
office of superintendent should be raised until a college education is required 
of applicants to fill this important position. 
Hic ScHoors 
During the past year there were 533 high schools in the State. Of this 
number, 202 gave four years of high school work, 87 gave three years, and 244 
gave two years. There were 1,474 teachers in all high schools, a total en- 
rollment of 29,641, and 2,663 graduates from the four-year high schools. 
The high school situation in the State is developing very satisfactorily. 
The figures compiled show a decided gain over the previous year in enroll- 
ment, attendance, salaries of teachers, number of schools and teachers, num- 
ber of graduates, as well as in receipts and expenditures. 
TEACHER TRAINING IN. County HicH SCHOOLS 
To meet the needs of the small counties in the matter of providing teach-_ 
ers of better education and some professional training, a three-unit teacher _ 
training course was adopted for use in the first-class high schools of the rural 
counties of the State. Thirty-seven counties organized teacher training 
classes at the beginning of the school term, September, 1921. 
Hundreds of graduates of the teacher training course are employed in. 
the rural elementary schools. Superintendents report that the work of these 
high school graduates with special training has been most satisfactory. No 
better service can be rendered by the high schools in the rural counties than 
to supplement the efforts of the normals and colleges of the State in the train- 
ing of teachers for the rural elementary schools. 
It is confidently believed that if teacher-training in county high schools is 
made a permanent feature in the rural counties, in five years’ time county 
boards of education and superintendents can make high school graduation, 
with special training, the minimum qualification of rural elementary teachers.

    VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE 
The progress made in Vocational Agriculture may be noted by referrin= 
to statistics found elsewhere in this report. 
The first year the work was organized, there were twelve schools with @ 
total enrollment of 189 boys. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1922, there 
were sixty-four schools with an enrollment of 2,116, all day students. Part— 
time work with farmers and junior project work with boys in the elementary 
schools began this year. There were 595 farmers and 660 junior project 
boys, making a total of 3,371 taking organized instruction. 
: The increase in schools since the beginning has been 433 per cent, and the 
increase in enrollment 1,683 per cent. 
It is interesting to note that the project earnings for three years has beem 
_ $168,989.81, and the State and Federal expenditures for four years have beem 
_ $131,502.28. The project earnings for the three years exceeded the expendi— 
tures for four years by $37,466.93. 
Part-TIME CONTINUATION SCHOOLS. 
    Part-time continuation schools have been organized in a number of the 
towns and cities of the State for the purpose of providing special instruction 
for the boys and girls between the ages of 14 and 16 who have left school be— 
cause the curriculum in the day school did not appeal to their interest or who 
_were forced, because of economic reasons, to go to work in shops and factories _ 
This class of students goesto workas soon as the law permits. In most 
cases they drift from job to job, and as a result their attitude towards society 
is not the best. 
: The part-time teachers are rendering a valuable service to these students 
___ by cultivating in their minds the proper attitude towards the home and the 
community, and by guiding them in the selection of a vocation suited to their 
abilities and natural bent. 
2 In the promotion of part-time continuation schools the appeal has be@nm 
made direct to the employers and to the children and their parents. The 
response on the part of both has, indeed, been gratifying. The average em— 
_ ployer gladly contributes to the financial support of the school. 
The employers report that the part-time pupils in their employ show a 
better attitude towards their work than before this work was organized. 
_ Aside from this, the output due to their employment is increased, notwith— 
standing the shorter hours of labor. The teachers of these part-time pupils” 
_ advise that their school spirit has been completely transformed. : 
I would recommend that the benefits of part-time instruction be extendeq 
___ by amending the Compulsory School Attendance Law so as to provide for 
_ the instruction of all employed children between the ages of 14 and 16 in al} 
villages, towns and cities of the State. 
              
      VocatioNAL Home Economics 
- Vocational Home Economics aims to provide instruction in home makin 
for the girl in high school;and for the woman who is already in her home but de— 
sires improved methods and has only short periods of time to devote to study _ 
Evening classes were organized in settlement districts in Nashville ag 
xtension work from Watkins Institute, and in the Nashville city schools _
-P-A-G-E-23
         
       Ina number of the towns of the State classes in clothing were organized it 
which the problem of making over old garments was emphasized. Under 
the able instruction of competent instructors some remarkable results wer 
_ obtained. : 
‘The Vocational Home Economics teachers have done a great deal of com: 
‘munity work in cooperation with nutrition workers, Red Cross activities, 
Associated Charities, Home Demonstration Agents and other local organiza- 
tions. 
The total number of all day white schools, meeting standards set up in — 
the State plans for 1921-22, was 33, with an enrollment of 1,419; eo 
schools, 20, with an enrollment of 617. 
The total number of all day negro schools, meeting standards set up in 
the State plans for 1921-22, was 11, with an enrollment of 524; evening 
schools, 11, with an enrollment of 494. 
    SUPERVISION 
“During the school year 1920-21 only 10 counties employed supervisors. 
In 1921-22, 12 counties took advantage of State aid in the employment of 
“Supervisors, some counties employing from two to five. see 
There is an urgent need for more adequate supervision of rural school work. _ 
_ The county superintendent’s duties are so many that it is a physical impos- 
sibility for him to give to this work the needed time. Efficient supervisors 
should be employed to aid in standardizing the schools and to give direct, 
efficient supervision of class room instruction. 
CONSOLIDATION 
During the past biennial period 86 consolidated school buildings have 
been erected, taking the place of 215 small schools. 
These schools cost approximately three-quarters of a million dollars. : 
Under the regulations of the State Board of Education, a county may 
receive State aid on only one consolidated schoo! building during any one 
year until all applications have been considered. This being true, the State 
has not aided on all consolidations in the State. For example, one county 
_ last year completed seven consolidated school buildings, State aid being given 
on two of the buildings only. 
In order to guarantee the erection of only the best types of school houses, 
_ Community School Plans are furnished by the State Department free of 
cost, for the guidance of county school officials in the construction of these 
schools. A 
“It is encouraging to note in connection with the consolidation movement — 
that wherever a practical consolidation has been effected in a county, that — 
- county has become a staunch advocate of consolidation, and is rapidly revising _ 
its educational ideals and policies. 
See special report on Consolidation for details of the work in the different — 
counties. 
PHILANTHROPIC AGENCIES 
    
Grateful acknowledgment is made of the encouragement given super- — 
vision by the General Education Board of New York. < 
The salaries and expenses of three State schoolinspectors and supervisors : 
in the State Department have been paid by this Board. Assistance is also 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
a ae 
given by the appropriation of funds to be used in the purchase of equip- 
ment for rural negro schools; in payment of the salaries of supervisors and 
teachers in training schools for negroes; and in aiding these teachers to 
take courses in approved summer schools. 
Other generous aid to this work has been made by the Jeanes and Slater 
_ Foundations. 
The Slater Board has provided funds for the payment of part salaries of 
rural negro county training school teachers. Also funds for the purchase of 
equipment and the encouragement of industrial work in the negro town 
schools. The Jeanes Board has provided a generous fund to be used in pay- 
ment of part of the salaries of negro county supervisors. 
The Julius Rosenwald Fund has given an impetus to the school building 
program for negroes. This fund is given on condition that the negroes and 
the county raise a supplement sufficient to complete the proposed buildings. 
A study of the report of the rural School supervisor will reveal the remarkable 
extent to which the negroes have been caused to give of their money, material 
and labor for the betterment of their schools. 
Through the cooperation of the above named agencies a new and more 
practical educational program for negroes is being evolved that will result in 
large benefits to our negro population, and that will greatly enhance the in- 
terests of the State. 
SratE NorMAL SCHOOLS 
An extensive building program has been carried out at each of the five State 
normals, $150,000 having been appropriated by the Legislature of 1921 as a 
building fund for each of the three normal schools for white teachers, $100,000 
for the Tennessee Polytechnic Institute, and $75,000 at the Agricultural and_ 
Industrial Normal School for negroes. 
At the Middle Tennessee State Normal the new buildings include a dor- 
mitory for men, a gymnasium, a laundry anda dairy barn. In addition to these 
buildings, a large apartment capable of housing at least sixty students was 
purchased as a dormitory for girls. 
At the East Tennessee State Normal a dormitory for men, a gymnasium, 
library, and a concrete silo were erected, and the Industrial Arts Building 
remodeled. 
Improvements at the West Tennessee State Normal include a new dining 
hall and kitchen; dormitory for men, and a power plant. 
At Cookeville the State has erected a dormitory for men, a dairy barn, anq 
a Mechanic Arts Building. The capacity of the Administration Building has 
been doubled, and an auditorium and laboratories have been added. 
With the $75,000 bond fund appropriated by the Legislature for the A _ 
and I. State Normal School, and other funds accruing to the State, more thay, 
$200,000 has been invested in permanent buildings in the past two years. 
These buildings include (1) a shop building used for auto mechanics 
gymnasium, shoemaking, printing, steam engineering and plumbing; 125 
additional rooms to the dormitories; a new dining hall and home economicg 
building; a heating system, concrete walks, greenhouse, and new dairy herq

  SORES 
CONFERENCES 
In November, 1921, a Conference of Church-aided and Private Colleges 
was held at Peabody College, Nashville, for the purpose of setting forth the 
need of trained teachers for the rural elementary schools, and of discussing 
ways wherein these institutions could render the maximum aid to the rural ~ 
elementary schools. These institutions are private in point of financial 
support, but public in service. Their contribution to Christian Education 
has been immeasurable. The need for their services in supplementing the 
work of the Normal Schools in teacher training is positive. The thirty-five 
representatives at the Conference pledged to the State Department of Edu- 
cation the hearty cooperation and support of the colleges of Tennessee, 
both public and private, in the work of training teachers for the public schools 
of the State. 
A special Conference for County Superintendents was held at the Uni- 
versity of Tennessee, Knoxville, the week beginning March 6, 1922. Seventy-. 
six of the ninety-five county superintendents and a number of members of 
county boards of education were present. Topics of fundamental importance 
to the schools of the State were studied. At the close of the five days’ con- 
ference, definite policies looking to the improvement of school conditions were 
presented and adopted as follows: 
Salary Schedule for County Teachers. 
A Score Card for Buildings. 
Uniform System of Reporting¢chool Expenditures. 
Standardization of Elementary Schools. 
In addition to this State-wide Conference, two special conferences of the 
county superintendents were held in each grand division of the State. These 
Conferences were characterized by the eagerness and earnestness of the su- 
perintendents to get a thorough understanding of their mutual problems and 
to find the most practical way of meeting them. It was unanimously voted 
to meet annually for such conferences. : 
Special conferences have been held in East, Middle and West Tennessee, 
both for high school principals and teachers and for vocational teachers. At 
these conferences problems pertaining to their respective divisions have been 
worked out by the principals and teachers and the members of the State 
Department having the work in charge. 
Prysicat Epucation 
. The mental and moral well-being of the individual is conditioned on a 
sound body. A sound body can only be assured by an intelligent under- 
standing and respect for the laws of health. 
Much has been accomplished in the schools during the past by the in- 
troduction of physical exercises and training in proper health habits. This 
effort, however, has not been general throughout the State, and especially in 
the rural schools. The work should be organized in a definite and systematic 
way, and regular training in health habits made a distinct and important 
feature of the school program. A law should be enacted making Physical 
Education compulsory, and providing for a State Physical Director whose 
duty it would be to organize a system of physical training for all schools, 
both rural and urban.
-P-A-G-E-26
te9G 
  Many preventable diseases may be practically eradicated by proper and 
systematic exercises and drills, which a physical director would be able to give. 
The record of the men drafted for military service during the World War 
in which more than thirty of every hundred men were pronounced unfit for 
military duty because of physical defects, is a challenge to the intelligent 
_ leadership of our nation. The children of today are no more fortunate than 
were their elders. A thorough-going physical education program will result 
in immeasurable increase in wealth and happiness to the home and society. 
     
  PUBLICATIONS 
Early in 1921 a course of study for elementary schools was carefully worked 
out by a committee of the educational leaders in the State. The aim of the 
State Department of Education was to outline a course of study flexible 
- enough to meet the needs of our schools. 
This is the first attempt to make a detailed course of study for the grades, 
and, while it has served very effectively, it should be revised, in the light of 
the criticisms*of the teachers who have been using it. 
A new adventure in publications from the State Department is the Ten- 
nessee Educational Bulletin. This monthly bulletin is used to disseminate 
news items of interest to the school people. Many official announcements 
usually sentincircularlettersare now made through the Bulletin. Through 
this medium the school public is kept informed as to school activities, 
the trend of educational thought and new policies affecting the schools of the 
State. ® 
The Bulletin now has a circulation of 3,000 monthly. S Se 
From the High School Department have been issued a High School _ 
Manual containing Laws and Regulations, Program of Studies, Curricula, 
and List of Text Books for the County High Schools; Graded List of Ap- 
proved County High Schools, and a Syllabus of Courses in Education and 
General Regulations Relating to the Teacher Training High Schools of 
Tennessee. i 
The Department of Vocational Education has issued a Course in Agri- 
culture for Elementary Schools, and a Course in Vocational Home Economics. | 
A series of 12 pamphlets containing Community School Plans have been 
- issued from the Division of Rural Schools. : 
Other publications during the biennial period are: 
Publicity Bulletin No. L, Industrial Rehabilitation Dept. 
Library List for Public Schools of Tennessee.

CHARTS AND EXPLANATIONS 
CHART I.—TAXABLE WEALTH FOR EACH CHILD OF SCHOOL AGE 
IN THE STATE. 
Do all counties experience the same difficulty in raising sufficient funds to educate their 
children? 
A study of this Chart shows that Hamilton County, with $4,159.00, has 7 times as much 
wealth per child as Pickett, with $648.00. This means that without State aid Pickett County 
would have to levy 7 times as much for schools as Hamilton County, if the children in each of 
these counties were to have equal educational opportunities. 
In 1921 Hamilton County levied 37c for elementary and high schools exclusive of State levy. 
To raise an equal amount per child, Pickett County would have been required to levy $2.40 for 
schools alone. 
Compare the first ten counties, which have an average wealth of $3,134.00, with the lowest 
ten, which have an average wealth of $811.00 for each child. The ten counties with the greatest 
wealth have to levy only one-fourth as much as the ten poorest counties, to maintain similar 
schools. This inequality is still further increased by the fact that it is more difficult to provide 
good educational facilities in sparsely settled communities. The first ten counties found it neces- 
sary to levy an average rate of 37/4c for schools in 1921. To have raised an equal amount per 
child by local taxation, the ten poorer counties would have been forced to levy for schools alone 
a tax of $1.50 on each $100.00 assessed valuation. If the poorer counties are to be able to proper- 
ly educate their children, they must receive State aid. 
Figures for this Chart were taken from the report of the tax commission for 1922 as to assess- 
ment, and from the school census report for 1921, as to the scholastic population. The wealth 
per child was found by dividing the total assessed valuation by the number of children between 
six and twenty-one years of age.

  CHARTS II AND III.—ANNUAL COST PER CHILD IN AVERAGE DAILY ATTEND-. 
ANCE IN RURAL AND CITY SCHOOLS 
Why do parents move to the city to educate their children? 
A comparison of Charts II and III_ reveal some very startling facts. In Memphis 
$74.26 is spent on each child in attendance. The county schools, however, cost only $26.86 per 
child. The figures for the city include high schools, hence the figures for Memphis are some higher 
than they would otherwise be. Nevertheless, almost three times as much is spent per child in 
Memphis as in the rural section of the county. In Knoxville $56.67 is spent on each child who 
attends school, whereas in the country surrounding $32.97 is spent. Thus almost twice as much 
is spent for a city child as for a country child. In Hamilton County a larger amount is spent 
for each rural child attending than is spent on the rural children in any other county. Neverthe-- 
less, Chattanooga spends $8.00 more per child than the remainder of Hamilton County. In 
Nashville $39.31 is spent for each child attending, but in the rest of Davidson County only 
$27.85 is spent. . 
Hamilton, Knox, Davidson, Shelby, Dyer and Henry fall in the first ten counties, when we 
consider both the city and the county expenditures. In the city schools an average of $46.79 
is spent for each child in attendance, as contrasted with $29.56 in the rural communities. When 
we consider the smaller counties, the difference is even more striking. Here the difference in 
length of term in the county and city systems is greater, and this difference in term causes the 
annual cost to be greater relatively than it is in some of the larger counties. 
In Blount County, Maryville and Alcoa spend $38.60 for each child in average daily at- 
tendance, as contrasted with $17.74 for the rural child. In Hardin County $31.76 is spent on 
each city child and $13.50 on the rural child. 
The average expenditure for city pupils attending is $40.00. Not one county in the entire 
State spends this much on its rural children. An average for the whole State shows that the 
tural child attending school has only $17.84 available for his education each year, whereas the 
city child has $40.35. It is not surprising then, that people prefer to live in cities, where twice 
as much money is spent on the education of their children as in rural communities. Compare 
with this table Chart VII of the Ayres Scale, which shows the average expenditure for both 
counties and cities. : 
In 1918 the average cost per pupil attending in rural schools in the United States was $33.00, 
which is larger than the expenditures in any Tennessee county except Hamilton and Knox. The 
average expenditure in the cities of the United States was $52.00, which is exceeded in Tennessee 
by Memphis and Knoxville alone. 
If Tennessee is to raise her educational rank among the forty-eight states, the rural school 
problem must receive even greater attention, The rural child is entitled to the same oppor- 
tunities given to the city child. 
Figures for Charts Il and III were found by taking the total amount spent for all 
purposes other than new school buildings and trustees’ commission and dividing this amount by 
the number of children in the average daily attendance. Permanent improvements were excluded 
since this item varies greatly from one year to another.

CHART IV.—COST OF TEACHING ONE PUPIL ONE DAY. 
What should it cost to keep a child in school one day? 
Tennessee answers this question with an average of 18c. The United States average is 42c. 
In no county of Tennessee is the cost of teaching one pupil one day as great as it is in the average _ 
State of the Union. Indeed, only one State spent less per pupil per day than Tennessee in 1920. 
At that time Arizona was spending 84c per pupil per day and Montana 80c. The highest in 
Tennessee is Shelby with 32c, followed by Knox, 26c, Polk, 25c, Hamilton, 24c, Carroll, 23c. At 
the other extreme we find that Hancock, Stewart and Fayette counties spend only 9c per pupil 
day. This is only slightly more than one-fourth the amount spent in Shelby County. Accord- 
ing to Chart I, Fayette County has twice as much wealth per child as Pickett, and is spending 
approximately the same amount of money per pupil per day. 
Obion County, with a wealth of $2,930.00 per child, as shown in Chart I, is the fifth wealth- 
iest county, according to the number of children. This means that it has more wealth per child 
than 89 other counties in the State. Yet 72 counties’spend more per pupil per day than Obion 
County. 
A similar comparison between the amount of wealth and the amount spent per pupil per day 
should be made for all of the other counties of the State. 
The figures for Chart IV were found by taking the total expenditures for all purposes other — 
than buildings and trustees’ commission and dividing this figure by the total number of days 
attended by all school children. 
      CHARTS V AND VI. 
Charts V and VI ‘show the enrollment by grades in all of the schools of the State, county 
and city, white and colored. The most striking fact in this Chart is that there are twice as many __ 
pupils enrolled in the first grade as in any other grade. This may be accounted for by the fact 
that a large number who entered the first grade are very irregular in attendance, and hence are __ 
forced to repeat the grade the following year. 
The next largest break is between the eighth grade and high school, showing that the high 
schools are getting only approximately one-half of the eighth grade graduates. By consulting 
Chart VII, it is found that 80% of the eighth grade graduates come from two and three- 
teacher schools, hence most of these pupils probably have high school facilities available. 
Each bar is divided into two sections, representing boys and girls. It is to be noted that in 
the first, second, third and fourth grades the boys outnumber the girls, Fifty-four out of every 
hundred in the first grade are boys. Beyond the fourth grade the girls outnumber the boys. 
Fifty-five percent of all pupils in the eight grades are girls, and in the fourth year of high school 
66% are girls, This shows that the schools have greater holding power for girls than for boys. ~ 
The three bars at the bottom show the perctnt enrolled in each grade of the elementary and 
high school for county systems, city systems and the United States. The figmes for county 
and city are for the scholastic year 1921-22 ; for the United States for 1918. 
The county systems enrolled 29% of all their pupils in the first grade, the city schools 21%, 
and the United States 20%. Likewise, both county and city systems in Tennessee enroll a larger 
percent of the pupils in the second and third grades than in the average schools of the United 
States. The percent enrolled beyond the fifth grade decreases much more rapidly in rural schools 
than in the cities or in the United States as a whole. In the sixth grade the counties enroll only 
7.3 percent, the cities 8.9 percent, and the United States 9.1 percent. In the eighth grade the 
counties enroll 4.7 percent, the cities 5.8 percent, and the United States 6.8 percent. The en- 
rollment in high schools is 6.1 percent of the total enrollment, in city high schools 6.6% and in 
the United States 9.6%. Both county and city systems will have to increase the holding power 
of their schools before Tennessee will equal the 1918 average for the United States. 
It is hoped that the county boards of education will be able to provide longer te1ms for 1922- 
23 asa result of the laws passed in 1921. This should tend to equalize educational opportunities — 
and remove the cause for much of the retardation which now exists in rural sections. Longer 
terms and better teachers are necessary if pupils are to show the same rate of advancement in — 
counties as in city schools. 
In Chart VI the grade distribution of county and city schools, elementary and high, is shown 
in another manner. The heavy curve shows the grade enrollment for the entire State. The 
broken line indicates the grade distribution of county pupils, and the dotted line the grade en- 
rollment of city schools. The piling up of pupils in the first grade is much less marked in city 
ae and the curve descends very gradually, without falling off so much beyond the sixth 
grade.

CHART VIL. 
The three bars at top of following page give us an indication of the part of the school popula~ 
tion which is being educated in county and.city schools. The upper bar shows that out of a 
total scholastic population of 815,000, 642,000 are enrolled in public schools, but that only 
420,000 are in regular attendance; thus we see that only slightly more than one-half of the total 
population between six and twenty-one years of age is in regular attendance. 
The upper bar shows that 73.9 percent 01 approximately three-fourths of all the children in 
the State live outside the cities. 
In the second bar we see that the counties are slightly more successful than the cities in 
enrolling their pupils in schools. Of the total enrollment 77.1 percent are in rural schools. ~ 
In the third bar we sve that the average daily attendance in the county is 74.8 percent of 
the total attendance in all schools. This shows that the counties have a very slight advantage 
due to the distribution of State money on the basis of attendance 1ather than scholastic popu- 
lation. Under the old system of apportioning school money the rural schools would have re- 
ceived 73.9 percent of the total elementary funds. Under the present law they receive 74.8 
percent. 
The children in the middle of the page show, for the entire State, the percentage of the school 
population enrolled in schools, the percentage of school enrollment in daily attendance, and the 
percentage of the total school population in daily attendance. 
The three bars at the bottom of the page compare the one-, two- and three-teacher schools 
in rural communities. Two out of every three tural schools in the State have only one teacher, 
and only one school in ten in Tennessee has three or more teachers. The one-room schools enroll 
44 out of every one hundred pupils. Only 28 out of every hundred, or one-fourth of the rural 
children, have the privilege ot attending three- or more teacher schools. In the second of these 
bars we see that although the one-teacher schools enroll 44% of all rural pupils, only 20% of the 
eighth grade graduates come from this type of school. This would indicate that normal prog- 
ress in these schools is almost impossible, at least with the type of teachers at present employed. 
By consulting Chart VIII it would seem that 62 percent of the teachers in one-teacher schools 
have less than a high school education, and 40% are themselves only eighth grade graduates or 
less. Under such conditions it is not to be expected that a large peiccnt will be held through the 
entire eight grades.

CHART VIII—EDUCATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
Are the best teachers found in one-, two-, or three-teacher schools? 
At the top of the Chart are three bars showing the training of teachers in one-, two-, and 
three- or more teacher schools. In the upper bar the training of teachers in one-room schools is 
given. We see that twenty of each one hundred, or one teacher in five, in one-room schools, have 
never even entered high school. Forty-two out of each hundred, or almost half of the total, 
have finished elementary school, and have done some work in high schools. Combining these 
two, we find that sixty-two out of the 100 have not finished high school. Of the remaining thirty- 
- eight, twenty-two have finished high school, but have had no additional training. This leaves 
a balance of only sixteen who have had training beyond high school. Nine of these sixteen have 
been to normal school but have not graduated. 
In the two-teacher schools the condition is somewhat better. Instead of twenty with only 
elementary training we find only eleven. Instead of forty-two with some high school training 
we find only thirty-seven. Twenty-seven of the teachers are high school graduates. Three 
have finished the academic normal course; twelve have finished high school and have done some 
work in normal schools. Two have graduated from normal schools; six have done some work in 
colleges, and two are college graduates. 
In the three- or more teacher schools, the training of teachers is much more satisfactory. 
Only two out of the one hundred have merely an elementary education, as against twenty in the 
one-teacher schools. Nineteen have only partial high school training, as against forty-two in 
one-teacher schools. Continuing this comparison of the educational equipment of teachers in 
one-, two-, and three-teacher schools, as shown in the Chart, we find that the children in three- 
teacher schools have seven times as much chance of securing a normal school graduate for their 
teacher, six times as much chance of securing a college graduate, and three times as much chance 
_ of securing a teacher who has had partial normal training. 
- The child who lives in a community where there is a large school is much more fortunate 
than the child in the same county who must attend a one-teacher school. 
At the bottom of the page another study is made to determine where teachers with each type 
of training are located. By consulting the upper bar, we find that 7114% of the normal school 
graduates are teaching in three- or more teacher schools. Only 914% or less than one out of 
every ten normal graduates are found in one-teacher schools, where almost one-half of all the 
children are enrolled. The three-teacher schools, with one-fourth of the total enrollment, have 
almost three-fourths of the normal graduates, five-eighths of the college graduates, and approx- 
imately one-half of all teachers with partial normal, partial college and academic normal training. 
and one-fourth of the high school graduates. 
The classes enumerated above have enough education to be able to teach successfully. 
There remains, however, two classes of teachers with less than high school education which 
include approximately one-half of the rural teaching force. There are in the State at present 
1,100 teachers who have never entered high school, and 3,000 who have entered high school but 
have not completed the course. Of those with only elementary education, the one- and two- 
teacher schools get 93%, and of those with partial high school training the one- and two-teacher 
schools get 84%. 
It is generally recognized that it is more difficult to teach in a one-teacher school than in a 
graded school. Nevertheless, the present practice is to send the teachers with less education and 
training into this type of school. This practice is due to the following reasons. First, the intel- 
ligent leadership in the larger communities demands well-trained teachers, and have the temerity 
to demand recognition at the hands of the Boards of Education. Second, it has been the custom 
of County Boards of Education to pay higher salaries to teachers in larger schools, even though 
these teachers have the same education and experience. Third, the teaching conditions and 
_ social and educational advantages afforded in the larger communities tend to make positions in 
_ the larger schools more attractive. 
Until the one- and two-teacher schools are made economically as attractive to good teachers. 
this type of schools will continue to suffer. This unequal opportunity offered 72% of the rural 
children of the State, if continued, will result in disaster to the rural civilization. 
Since the economic factor enters into the educational problem of the small community, the 
_ County Board of Education, and the County Board of Education alone, must solve the question 
_by placing a sufficient salary to secure the strongest teachers for the smaller schools.

  FOREWORD ~ 
To the School Officials and Friends of Education in Tennessee: 
To obtain a more accurate idea concerning the relative merit of the school — 
systems in the various counties of Tennessee, Mr. Joe Jennings, Associate 
High School Inspector, and Mr. A. B. Caldwell, Chief Clerk, were requested 
to rank the counties in the order of their educational efficiency, The measure- 
ments used in this comparison are the same as those used by Dr. Leonard P. 
Ayres of the Russell Sage Foundation in his study of State School Systems. 
The reader of this report should keep the following points in mind: 
In each county all of the schools, white and colored, have been considered, 
including those under city boards of education. It would have been prefer- 
able to have limited this study to those schools under the control of the county 
boards of education, but the difficulty of separating county and city high 
school statistics rendered this impossible. 2 
Before passing judgment on any county for high or low scores, an investi- 
gation should be made as to the ability of the county to provide adequate 
educational facilities. 
Many of the counties are handicapped because of a limited amount of 
taxable wealth per child of school age. For example, Pickett County has 
an assessed valuation of $641 per child of school age, according to the 1922 
assessment, and on the other hand Shelby County has an assessed valuation 
of $4,983 for each child of school age. 
There are other conditions which are a hindrance to educational progress 
in some counties. Among these are sparsely settled communities, bad roads, 
natural barriers, and the one-crop system. 
The tables worked out in this study are based upon the certified reports of 
county superintendents and teachers for the year ending June 30th, 1922. 
The ranking of many of these counties will not be pleasing, but the public is 
entitled to know the truth. Until all the facts are known, there is but little 
hope of arousing the public conscience as to the needs. “Ye shall know the 
truth and the truth shall make you free.” 
We trust that a study of this report will encourage each county to renewed 
effort to raise its standing in those items in which it is deficient. 
J. B. Brown. 
The most significant facts revealed by this investigation are presented in 
the opening pages, and are illustrated in the charts. The methods used in 
obtaining these conclusions are explained in the discussion following. An 
inspection of the two tables given later in this report will disclose the strength 
and weakness of the educational system of each county. 
1. Which county has the best school system? 
The most accurate and best known method of comparing school systems 
is that used by Leonard P. Ayres in ranking State school systems. Ayres 
showed that in 1918 forty-one States had better systems than Tennessee. 
This same method applied to the counties of Tennessee indicates that Hamil- 
ton County, with a score of seventy-eight, has the best school system in the 
= 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
             
   eg 
State. Shelby, Bradley, Washington, Knox and Davidson follow in the order 
named. The highest State average in 1918 was Montana, with a score of 
seventy-six. Thus, we see that the highest State average in 1918 is now sur- 
passed by Hamilton County. (See Chart I.) 
2. What: questions were considered in estimating the worth of a school 
system? 
(1) Percent of school children in average daily attendance. 
(2) Average days attended by each child of school age. 
(3) Average number days schools were kept open. 
(4) The part of the total number attending schools who attended high 
school. : 
: (5) The number of boys as compared with the number of girls in high 
school. 
(6) The number of dollars spent for each child who attended school. 
-(7) The number of dollars spent for each child of school age. 
(8) The total number of dollars spent divided by the number of teachers. 
(9) The number of dollars spent per pupil not including teachers. 
(10) Average annual salary of teachers. 
  _ 8. Where do the most children of school age take advantage of the school 
term provided? a3 
In Van Buren County three out of four children attended every day school 
wasinsession. Contrasted with this, in Lake County a little more than one- 
third of the children attended school daily. In Cumberland County, which 
is the average county in this respect, fifty-six out of every one hundred chil- 
dren of school age were found in school each day. Pennsylvania, the average 
_ State in 1918, also kept fifty-six out of each one hundred in attendance. (See 
Beechart<1I.) 
_ 4. If the total number of days actually attended by those enrolled were 
eS divided equally among all the children of school age, how many days 
would there be for each child? 
Trousdale County leads in this respect with 115 days for each child. 
Hamilton follows with 114; Lake County “tails the list,” giving but 54 days 
per child. The average for Tennessee is 91 days, which is the same as the 
United States average in 1918. (See Chart III.) i     
     
    
      
    5. Which county provided the longest school term? ‘ 
Trousdale offered its children a term of 175 days. Warren County is at 
_ the bottom of the list with 86 days. The average child in Tennessee was 
__ offered a term of 141 days, which is one month less than the average for the” 
_ United States in 1918. (See Chart IV.) 
    6. oe were the most successful in placing their children in high 
school? 
__ Knox County has the largest percent of its enrollment in high schoo] 
where out of every one hundred pupils twelve are in high school. Last year 
Pickett and Union Counties had no high schools. In Macon County only 
one out of every one hundred was in high school. For every twelve given 
high school instruction in Knox County, only one is given similar instruction 
in Macon. (See Chart V.)
-P-A-G-E-67
                —67— 
7. Where do the high schools enroll approximately the same number of 
boys and girls? 
The three counties enrolling practically the same number of boys and — 
girls are Hickman, McNairy and Claiborne. Benton County ranks lowest | 
in this respect, enrolling only four boys to every ten girls. In Tennessee 
about eight boys are enrolled in high school to every ten girls. _ This is 
slightly better than the United States average in 1918. (See Chart VI.) 
8. Which counties place the highest value on a child’s education? 
The real test of the value which the different counties place upon educa- 
tion is determined by the relative amounts they are spending. Hamilton’ 
County spent last year $92.31 for each child in average daily attendance. 
Shelby County spent $73.38 for each child in average daily attendance. On 
the other hand, Hancock spent only $9.80. It is to be remembered that a 
considerable portion of this $9.80 was contributed by the State, and that 
Hancock levied only the minimum tax rate necessary to secure these State 
funds. (See Chart VII.) 
9. Is every county raising sufficient funds to educate all of its children? 
An investigation of this question shows that many counties are spending 
an extremely small amount as compared to the total number of children of 
school age. Hamilton County spends most in this respect, the amount being 
$59.89 for each child between six and twenty-one years of age. This, however, 
represents a considerable expenditure for new buildings. Shelby County 
spends $37.00 for each child of school age, and Bradley County $36.39. 
Compare with this the following expenditures: Hancock County $5.58 and 
Macon $7.18. As noted above, Hancock County made the minimum levy 
necessary to secure the State equalizing fund. The same is true of Macon 
- County. In each of these counties the total expenditure for permanent im- 
provements was less than $1,500, showing that no preparation is being made 
for better conditions in the future. The United States average in 1918 was 
$27.58, and the Tennessee average in 1922 was $18.54. (See Chart VIII.) 
10. Where is the most money spent per teacher employed? 
This is merely another measure of the value which the different counties 
place on education. Hamilton County spent $2,635.92 for every teacher 
employed. This includes all expenditures, not merely teachers’ salaries. 
Shelby County came next with an expenditure of $1,902.48. Hancock 
County is again found at the bottom of the list with $388.56. Grundy is 
second from the bottom, with an expenditure per teacher of $409.20. Com- 
pare with these the United States average of $1,142.00, and the Tennessee _ 
average of $1,019.28. (See Chart IX.) 
11. How much should be spent in addition to teachers’ salaries? : 
It is usually found that schools are poorest where little or no money is 
spent for purposes other than teachers’ salaries. Good school facilities cannot 
be built up without an expenditure of money. Hamilton County, exclusive 
of teachers’ salaries, spent $57.00 for each child attending. A part of this 
expenditure was due to the unusual building program carried on in this county 
last year. The standard expenditure per child, as used by Ayers, is $50.00. 
Decatur County, which is lowest in this item, spent only $1.01 per child last 
year. In this county the elementary teacher must act as janitor and provide 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  Ego ss 
_ fuel and certain other supplies for his school, out of his annual salary of only 
' $344.45. This policy is one of the reasons why, in Decatur County, 63% 
of the teachers have only an elementary education, and only 16% have finished 
high school. In Hamilton County every teacher has more than an elemen- 
tary education, and 96% of them are high school graduates, or better. (See 
Chart X.) 
12. Which county gets the best teachers? 
The reports submitted this year show clearly that the counties which pay 
the highest salaries secure the best qualified teachers. The 1,355 teachers 
of Shelby County, with an average annual salary of $1,098, are the best paid 
teachers of the State. Three-fourths of these teachers have had either 
normal or collegiate training. The remainder, with an exception of 67 
teachers, are at least high school graduates. It is to be noted that these 67 
teachers are colored. In other words, every white teacher in Shelby County 
has not less than a high school education. Contrast with this Overton 
County, which has an average annual salary of $262.08. In this county, 
where there are only two colored teachers, the following conditions prevail: 
Three-fourths of the teachers have not finished high school. Six teachers 
out of every ten have never entered high school, and not one of the ele- 
mentary teachers has had any professional training in normal school or col- 
lege. A county must pay an adequate salary before it can hope to. secure 
teachers with professional training. (See Chart XI.) : 
13. What educational advance has Tennessee made since 1918? 
Tennessee has made remarkable progress in the four-year period from 
1918 to 1922. Her index number has risen from 35.14 to 45.49, a gain of 
10.35. This is most noteworthy, considering the advance made in the 
period from 1890 to 1918. In this space of twenty-eight years the index 
number rose from 21.01. to 35.14, a gain of only 14.13. An inspection of 
table below will reveal the marked progress from 1918 to 1922 as compared 
with any previous ten-year period.

  EXPLANATION OF THE TEN PoINTs 
Each of the ten index numbers is so arranged that under ideal conditions 
it would be 100. For example, the first item, “Percent of school population 
attending school daily” would, under ideal conditions, be 100 percent if 
every child of school age attended school every day. The third point, 
“Average number of days schools were kept open,” under ideal conditions 
would be 200 days. In order to obtain the index number, the length of term 
is divided by 2. Following is a detailed explanation of each of the points as 
applied to the schools of Tennessee: 
Tiem 1: ‘‘The percent of school population in average daily attendance.’’ 
This is found by dividing the average daily attendance by the total number of 
children between the ages of six and twenty-one years. The figures used by 
Ayers in his study of the 48 States are secured by dividing the average daily 
attendance by the number of children between five and eighteen years of 
age. It has been considered wise to change these figures for Tennessee to 
conform to the legal school age. If all of the children between six and twenty- 
one years of age attend school every day during the school year, that county 
would receive the index of 100 on this item. In Tennessee 55.85 percent of 
all children of school age were in attendance. Thus the same item is found 
for all the counties and entered as “Item 1.” 
Item 2: “The average days attended by each child of school age.” This 
is determined by dividing the aggregate days attended by all students in 
Tennessee by the total number of children of school age. If all of the chil- 
dren of school age attend school every day, and if all of the schools were 
kept open 200 days, the average number of days attended by each child would 
be 200. In order to make this figure comparable with the percentage figures 
in Item 1, the actual number of days attended is divided by two. Thus, in 
Tennessee the average number of days attended by each child of school age 
last year was 90.52. One-half of this number is 45.26, which is the index 
number for the entire State, under the “Second Item,” 
   
-P-A-G-E-93
      298-3 
Tiem 8: “Average number of daysschools werekeptopen.” This figure is 
entered as one-half the average number of days taught in all the schools of 
the county. Under ideal conditions, it is assumed that this figure would be 
200, hence, to make it comparable with the other items it is entered at one- 
half its actual value. The schools of Tennessee last year ran for an average 
of 140.72 days. One-half of this gives us an index number of 70.36. 
Tiem 4: ‘The percent that high school attendance was of total attend- 
ance.” If all of the pupils who enter the first grade should finish one grade 
each year and should remain in school until the completion of a high school 
course, one-third of the total enrollment would be in high school. Hence, 
the actual percentage found by dividing the high school attendance by the 
total attendance is multiplied by three before it is entered as the “Fourth 
Item.” In Tennessee we find that 7.55 percent of all pupils are in high school, 
and three times this figure gives an index number of 22.64. 
Item §: “Percent that boys were of girls in high schools.” This percent- 
age is used directly on the assumption that an equal number of boys and girls 
should be in high school. Should the number of boys exceed the number of 
girls, the percentage of girls to boys is taken. In Tennessee the number of 
boys in high school is 77.13 percent of the number of girls. 
Item 6: “Annual expenditure per child in average daily attendance.” 
This is entered at its actual value. It is found by dividing the total expendi- 
tures for all purposes by the total average daily attendance. Tennessee 
spends an average of $32.18 as compared with the standard of $100.00. 
Item 7: ‘Average annual expenditure per child of school age.” This 
item is entered in dollars at its actual value. It is found by dividing the 
total expenditures by the number of children between six and twenty-one — 
years of age. The average in Tennessee was $20.70 as compared with the 
standard of $100.00. 
Item 8: “Average annual expenditure per teacher employed.” This is 
found by dividing the total expenditure by the total number of teachers em- 
ployed, and dividing this quotient by twenty-four. It is thus one-half of 
the monthly expenditure per teacher if all the months of the year are taken 
into consideration. The standard for this item is $200.00 per month, hence 
the index number under ideal conditions would be $100.00. The average 
monthly expenditure for this item in Tennessee is $82.14, and the index 
number, $41.07. 
Item 9: ‘Expenditure per pupil for purposes other than teachers’ sal- 
aries.’ Expenditures for other than teachers’ salaries are divided by the 
number of children in average daily attendance, and the quotient is multi- 
plied by two in order to secure the index number. This is based on the 
assumption that the standard expenditure is $50.00 per child. Tennessee 
spent $11.46, hence the index number for the State is 22.93. 
Item 10: ‘Expenditure per teacher for salaries.’ The figure used is the 
average monthly salary per teacher on a twelve-month basis. This is based 
on the assumption that the annual salary of a teacher should be $1,200, or 
$100.00 per month. The average annual salary in Tennessee is $634.65, or 
$52.89 per month on a twelve-month basis. :

       ‘The sum of these ten index numbers as computed for the entire State is _ 
43,230, which, divided by ten, gives us an average of 43.23. It may be said 
‘by some that the standards as set up in this scale are too high for Tennessee — 
at the present time. It is to be noted that Hamilton County, with an index 
‘number of 78.26, has a higher index number than any of the 48 States hadin- 
1918. At that time the highest was Montana, with an index number of 
75.79, followed by California with 71.21. This indicates that, although the 
standards set up are very high, they are no higher relatively for the counties 
of Tennessee than for the States of the Union. : 
In order that a clear understanding of these ten items may be had, it is 
well to consult the following table. Under ideal conditions each county 
could score 100 points on each of the ten items. These conditions would 
be as follows: 
  A PERFECT SCORE WOULD REPRESENT THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS—

Report of State High School Inspector 
Nashville, Tennessee, November 18, 1922. 
Supt. J. B. Brown, Secretary State Board of Education, Nashville, Tennessee. 
Dear Sir:    There is submitted herewith complete statistics concerning the high 
schools of Tennessee for the year ending June 30, 1922, and other general 
information and statistics concerning the high school situation for a period 
of years. 
Mr. B. O. Duggan, State high school inspector since 1919, resigned in 
February, 1922, and the present high school inspector, who had been asso- 
ciated with him in the work, was elected as his successor. Mr. Joe Jennings, 
associate high school inspector, and I have sought to carry on the work, and 
the facts here presented give credit to Mr. Duggan and his predecessors in 
office, who have so successfully directed the high school movement. 
During the past year there were 533 high schools in the State. Of this 
number 202 gave four years of high school work, 87 gave three years, and 244 
gave two years. There were 1,474 teachers in all the high schools, a total 
_ enrollment of 29,641, and 2,802 graduates from the four-year high schools. 
The high school situation in the State is developing very satisfactorily. 
_ The figures compiled show a decided gain over the previous year in enroll- 
_ ment, attendance, salaries of teachers, number of schools and teachers, and 
number of graduates, as well as in receipts and expenditures. 
-ENROLLMENT AND ATTENDANCE 
Reference to the tables in the following pages show that the enrollment in 
the county high schools of the State amounts to approximately 30,000, and 
the average daily attendance to about 25,000; but these figures do not fairly 
represent the high school situation in Tennessee, inasmuch as they do not 
include statistics from the large city high schools, the high school pupils en- 
rolled in private high schools and academies, and the enrollment in the negro ~ 
high schools of the cities and the few counties in which there are such schools. 
To the figures given above should be added the enrollment of 9,500 white 
students in city high schools, the enrollment of 2,634 colored students in the 
city and county high schools, and more than 3,000 Tennessee students in 
private high schools in the State. The average daily attendance should be 
increased proportionately. The total high school enrollment in the State, 
therefore, is approximately 45,000, of which 41,000 are white students and the 
remainder colored; and the average daily attendance totals approximately 
35,000 in all high schools. 
THE TEACHING FoRcE 
Table 5 furnishes very interesting information in regard to the teaching 
force of the State. It will be observed that there were employed in the county 
high schools last year 1,474 teachers, of which number 734 were men and 740 
_ were women. The proportion of male teachers in high schools is very 
much larger than in elementary schools of the State, which can be explained, 
_ no doubt, by the longer term and larger salaries in high school positions. 
 
-P-A-G-E-218
  —218— 
    Of the 1,474 teachers employed in the county high schools, 1,024 were 
engaged in the four-year high schools and 450 in the three and two-year schools. 
Comparing the enrollment and teaching force in the four-year high schools 
with the three and two-year high schools, we find that the teacher-pupil ratio 
is 21 in the first type of high school as against 17 in the second. 
The cost per pupil in the four-year high schools is $58.00 per year, as 
against $61.00 per pupil enrolled in the three and two-year high schools; and 
when we consider that the education and training of the teachers in the four- 
year schools are superior and that the equipment and general physical con- 
ditions are also much better, it will be found that the real cost in the three 
and two-year schools of the State is considerably greater than that in the 
four-year schools. 
An interesting study of the salary schedule is made in table 4. A sum- 
mary of that table is as follows: 
The average annual salary of 1,474 high school teachers in all high schools is_ 
The average annual salary of 1,024 teachers in four-year high schools is___- 
    
     
    1,241.19 
‘The average annual salary of 450 teachers in two and three-year high schools 1,066.63 
The average annual salary 734 men in all high schools. 1,354.49 
The average annual salary 740 women in all high schools 1,021.74 
The average annual salary 446 men in four-year schools___ 1,519.39 
The average annual salary 288 men in two and three-year schools. 1,097.44 
The average annual salary 578 women in four-year schools__._-.-- 1,024.13 
The average annual salary 162 women in two and three-year schools_ 1,013.35 
The average annual salary of 193 principals of four-year high schools 1,873.09 
The average salary of 299 principals of two and three-year high schools. 1,153.41   
We have no comparative figures in regard to the education and training — 
of the county high school teachers, but statistics given in table 5 seem to — 
indicate improvement in this respect. The figures given on thispoint are not 
asaccurateas they shouldbe, since the term, college graduate, does not mean 
the same thing to all the officials who report our school statistics, but it ap- 
pears that about 40% of the teachers in our four-year high schools are col- 
lege graduates, while about 25% more have had some college training. 
Nearly all the teachers in our four-year schools hold first grade or profes- 
sional certificates. 
CoMPARATIVE STATISTICS 
A better idea of the marked development of the county high school sit- 
uation will be given by a study of the summaries below showing the progress 
during the last ten years in the county high schools of the State, as well as a 
table giving comparative statistics for the high schools from 1909 to 1922:

533 1,474 1,188.00 29,681 
  From any point of view that we study these comparative figures, the de- 
velopment of the high school situation is clearly manifest. 
The number of high schools has increased 380 per cent during the ten 2 
  years, and there are nearly 8 times as many four-year schools in 1922 as in 
1912, The number of teachers and pupils enrolled have increased about 
fourfold. The value of school property is six times as great, and the receipts 
and expenditures for high school purposes are eight or nine times what ne 
were in 1912.
-P-A-G-E-220
—220— 
In 1912 the high school enrollment in county white schools was 2% of 
the total enrollment, in 1922 the high school enrollment is’7% of the total. 
The growth of the enrollment in the various years of the high school course 
reveals an improvement of the high school situation, inasmuch as it shows a 
more evenly distributed percentage of the total enrollment throughout the 
four years. In 1912 the percentage of high school students was as follows: 
first year, 50%; second year, 26%; third year, 15% and fourth year, 9%; and 
in 1922 the percentages were as follows: first year, 42%; second year, 27%; 
third year, 19%; and fourth year, 12%. Weare slowly approaching the ideal 
situation when there will be approximately the same percentage in each year 
of the high school course. 
The facts given above indicate a remarkable and gratifying growth, and 
show the strong hold that the high schools have on the interests of the people 
of the State. It is safe to assert that the high schools are improving in their 
standards—as regards teaching force, the type of work done, the equipment 
and physical conditions—quite as much as they are growing in numerical 
strength. : 
Satisfactory standards have long since been established for the four- 
year high schools, and in spite of the growth in the number of such high 
schools, these standards have been reasonably well maintained. The most 
important problem that confronts us now is to standardize properly the two 
and three-year high schools. The State Board of Education has adopted 
regulations to this effect during the last few months, and a more serious at- 
tempt is being made to bring the work of such schools up to the standards 
that prevail in the four-year high schools. 
We also need to consider the large number of students, approximately 
-2,500, who are being instructed in high school subjects by teachers who are 
employed in the elementary schools. If proper safeguards are thrown around 
such instruction so that these boys and girls may have properly prepared 
reachers, with such length of recitation periods and school term as will entitle 
them to high school credit, the needs of the situation will have been fairly 
met. I take it that we need some legislation to remedy this defect in our high 
school situation; and I suggest that it may be done by providing for the es- 
tablishment of junior high schools, comprising the seventh, eighth and ninth 
grades, under such regulations as the State Board of Education may provide. 
Respectfully submitted, 
J. W. BristEr, 
State High School Inspector.

It seems desirable that students completing the three-unit course should 
be given more recognition in the matter of certification than students finishing 
the one-unit course. Steps should be taken at the next Legislature to bring 
about this recognition. 
Statistics compiled from the county superintendents’ reports for the school 
year ending June 30, 1922, show that 1,648 new teachers were needed in the 
white elementary county schools. 1,354 of these were needed in the one- 
and two-teacher schools. : 
373 white students finished the three-unit teacher training course in June. — 
The great majority of these are either teaching now or continuing their 4 
professional work in normals or colleges. Eight out of every ten of those now | 
teaching are teaching in the one- and two-teacher schools, according to reports | 
now available. It may be seen that the teacher training courses have already 
begun to fulfil the purpose for which they were established. 4 
In five years from now, with adequate State aid, the teacher training high — 
schools will be able to supply a sufficient number of professionally trained | 
high school graduates to fill the vacancies in the one- and two-teacher schools. | 
The following high schools received State aid and offered the three-unit i 
teacher training course: .

. SUGGESTED EQuipMENT 
On account of the limited State funds available for teacher training work, 
it is impossible to require of teacher training schools many desirable items. 
However, it is strongly urged that where they can do so, teacher training 
schools provide for themselves as many items on the following list as possible. 
1. A separate room for the teacher training classes and library. 
2. A reading table or tables. 
3. Book cases. 
4. Maps. A world set, U. S., Tennessee. ; 
5. Map of county especially urged. This can, in many instances, be 
secured by writing your congressman. All schools of the county should be 
located on this map.

DIVISION OF VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 
Report OF STATE SUPERVISOR OF AGRICULTURE 
Vocational agricultural education in Tennessee has made progress and 
has been hindered. On June 30, 1921, there were five of the 1920-21 schools 
to be discontinued. Three of these were not located in schools that were 
well suited to vocational agriculture. One discontinued the work because 
the teacher could not teach other subjects and be reimbursed for full time. 
One was discontinued because of general dissatisfaction. 
On July 1, 1921, there were added nine new schools. Two of these were 
schools that had been on the list in 1919-20. There was a very small turnover 
in teachers from 1920-21 to 1921-22. Two were lost to the cause out of a 
total of thirty-eight. There were thirty-nine schools with thirty-eight teach- 
ers in 1920-21. There were forty-six schools with forty-five teachers in 
1921-22. 
The general agricultural education situation in the state for the negroes 
has been good. Three new men were put in charge of six schools in one 
county. Two schools were dropped because County Board of Education 
did not see fit to continue them, as the financial condition of the county was 
not the very best. Seven new schools were added in Shelby. Four men have 
charge of these.. The man who taught in Carroll County in 1920-21 was 
transferred’to Colliersville. The man who taught in Wilson County Train- 
ing School was transferred to the Hardeman County Training School, due to 
the death of the teacher at that place. The man who taught in the Water- 
town Preparatory School. was transferred to the Wilson County Training. 
School. The only loss of colored teachers was one. This was caused by 
death. The number of schools in 1920-21 was fourteen with fourteen teach- 
ers. The number this year is nineteen with sixteen teachers. 
The State Supervisor has officially visited each school once, made twenty- 
one promotional visits, held three sectional conferences with white teachers 
and one conference with negro teachers, and presented the cause of vocational 
eres to the county superintendents and high school principals of the 
tate. 
Special work has been accomplished in part-time work, junior project 
work and community activities. The attached sheets give the nature of 
the work in detail. x 
The Department of Agricultural Education of the University of Tennes- 
see, in cooperation with the State Board for Vocational Education, has pub- 
lished ‘The Survey as a Means of Working Out a Course of Study in Voca- 
tional Agriculture” and ‘‘A Bibliography of Agricultural Experiment Station 
and Extension Service Bulletins.”

    The final project report of forty-four white schools and ten negro schools 
in thirty-four counties of the State shows that 1,442 boys began project work 
in 1921 and 1,146 of this number completed their projects. 
The scope of the projects taken is represented by a total of 1,861 acres, 
1,348 animals and 4,134 chickens. 
The financial return of the project work is gratifying, when the general 
depression of the country is taken into consideration, and especially the slump 
in the price of farm produce. The gross earnings of the boys, after all out- 
side charges had been deducted, were $95,937.13, or an average of $82.99 
per capita. Of this amount, $69,163.40 was earned by 613 white boys, an 
earning of $112.82 per capita, and $26,774.73 was earned by 533 negro boys, 
an earning of $50.23 per capita. 
2 The total number of hours the boys worked at the projects was 112,277. 
_ The return per hour of labor for all the boys was 85 cents. The return per 
_ hour of the white boys was 80 cents, and the return per hour of the negro 
_ boys was $1.11. 
4 Corn, hogs, dairying and poultry were the most popular projects. There 
were 378 boys to engage in corn growing. ‘Their projects represented 1,189 
acres of land, and their earnings were $23,422.11. This represents an earning 
_ of $62.00 per capita or an income of $11.30.per acre. 
There were 197 boys engaged in pork production projects. Their earn- 
ings from 1,084 hogs were $12,612.83. The earning per capita was $64.02. 
__ The return per hog was $11.63. 
There were 51 boys engaged in the dairy business, with 181 cows. The 
a were $12,058.82, or $236.44 per capita. The return per cow was 
There were 104 boys doing project work with 4,134 chickens. Their 
earnings were $7,150.47. The earning per capita was $68.75. Each hen 
gave a return of $1.72. 
In terms of money returned for money spent, the project earnings returned 
$2.17 for each dollar of Federal money spent; $2.58 for each dollar of State 
money spent; $3.50 for each dollar of local money spent, and eighty-eight 
cents for each dollar of Federal, State and local money spent. 
    During the past year 28 part-time classes were given. There were 595 
farmers to attend. Junior project work was organized in forty schools and 660 
little boys in the rural elementary schools were instructed in elementary agri- 
culture and lined up for project work. Besides this, the men had 35 organi- 
zations with an active enrollment of 3,280. Thirty-one community fairs 
were held with an attendance of 37,039. In addition to the fairs there were 
_ held 366 farmers’ meetings, with an attendance of 32,842. It can be seen 
_ from this that teachers of vocational agriculture have come in contact with 70,476 
people outside of the school room. 
: As a means of community service, teachers helped in pruning 16,975 
_ trees, spraying 7,809 trees, terracing 2,840 acres of land, draining 905 acres, 
culling 10,555 hens, treating 681 sick animals, and vaccinating 502 hogs for 
cholera. They responded to 4,511 phone and 5,610 personal inquiries from 
farmers. There were 3,514 farmers, exclusive of projects, visited. The number 
of rural elementary schools visited was 292; teachers’ meetings attended were 335.

The majority of those enrolled in the instructor training classes were from 
the trades and industries, and took the work to enable them to better dis- 
charge their instructional duties “on the job.” 
Temporary vocational certificates are given upon the recommendation 
of Professor Coxen, to those who satisfactorily complete the work. 
These groups furnish us a source from which excellent instructors for 
evening classes can be selected.

CONSOLIDATION 
Under provisions of the public school laws of the State, the Department of 
Public Instruction has cooperated with county authorities in erecting 86 
consolidated school buildings during the biennial period ending June 30, 
1922. These buildings range in type from three to ten teachers, and repre- 
sent, according to inspection reports, a total cost of $795,672.00, of which 
$85,818.75 was paid by the State. By reason of the erection of these 86 
buildings, 215 old dilapidated buildings have been abandoned, and the 
children that formerly occupied them are now comfortably housed in new, 
attractive buildings, adequately lighted, properly ventilated, conveniently 
arranged and heated. 
In the distribution of State aid for consolidation, two objects have been 
kept constantly in mind. First, the State authorities have endeavored to 
place the funds in communities that stood in greatest need, provided the _ 
conditions were met. Working on this basis, the rural communities have 
naturally profited most; second, an effort has been made throughout the 
entire building program to standardize school buildings. In so doing, the 
best authorities on school house architecture have been consulted, and plans 
worked out combining the most modern ideas on lighting, ventilation, 
economical arrangement of space, sanitation, heating and attractiveness. 
All buildings aided by the State must have represented the union or bringing 
together of two or more schools, and must have been built according to plans 
and specifications furnished by the Department, or upon plans and specifi- 
cations approved by the Department. 
In order to meet an urgent need in the matter of consolidation, the old 
tuling providing that the State would pay one-fourth the cost of the building, 
not exceeding $1,000.00, was repealed, and the following regulations made: 
In accordance with Section 2, Chapter 118, Acts 1921, the State Board of 
Education in regular meeting hereby formulates the following plan on which 
the distribution of the State school funds shall be made available for the 
encouragement of consolidation of rural schools. 
1. County Boards of Education having the sole authority to consolidate 
public schools, and who desire State aid for this purpose, shall file with the 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction application on forms that will be 
furnished by the Department for aid. 
2. A site consisting of not less than two acres of ground for small buildings, 
and more for larger ones, approved by a representative from the State Depart- 
ment of Public Instruction and deeded to the County Board of Education, 
without a reverting clause, shall be provided. : 
3. All plans shall be furnished by the State Department of Public In- 
struction or approved by same. 
4. School buildings erected according to plans and specifications shall be 
completed in detail, painted inside and out, and equipped with suitable fur- 
niture. 
5. All buildings and equipment shall be inspected and approved by a 
tepresentative from the Department of Public Instruction before State 
funds are issued. 
6. Whenever two or more public schools are brought together in one cen- 
tral school and a standard two-teacher building erected according to plans 
   
-P-A-G-E-270
0 
and specifications, provided or approved by the Department, the State will 
pay $750.00 on the cost of the building; $1,000.00 on a three-teacher type; and 
a maximum of $1,250.00 on a four-teacher or larger type. 
7. In the event there are not funds enough to apply to all regular applica- 
tions, preference shall be given those counties which have not heretofore 
received aid. 
So popular is the movement to abandon the little isolated one-teacher 
school, a number of well-arranged and attractive consolidated buildings have 
been built om State plans independently of State aid. Under the regulations, 
the funds do not apply to more than one school in a county, until all applica- 
tions have been considered. This being true, the county that puts on a real 
building program frequently builds from three to five splendidly arranged and 
equipped consolidated schoolhouses, two or more of which are paid for in- 
dependently of State funds. This being true, it is very evident that more 
State funds must be made available, if the necessary building requirements 
are met. 
Below is a list of the counties, names of new schools, amount paid by State, 
amount paid by local authorities, total cost of buildings, and the type of each 
for the scholastic year ending June 30th, 1922. The type of building indi- 
cates the number of standard class rooms provided, and in addition, each 
building is provided with cloak rooms and an auditorium in keeping with the 
community needs. The four-teacher and larger type buildings are provided 
with office and library rooms in addition to industrial rooms.

SUPERVISION 
Recognizing the urgent need of more adequate supervision of public school 
work, the Legislature very wisely provided funds to be used in encouraging 
Boards of Education to employ County Supervisors, whose duty it is to assist 
County Superintendents of Public Instruction in the organization, gradation 
and supervision of the public schools of the county, and in the organization 
of industrial work. The funds appropriated for this purpose are never given 
outright, but are always matched by either philanthropic funds or by local — 
county funds. Before State aid is granted to a county to be used in paying 
the salary of a Supervisor, the State Department of Public Instruction must 
approve of the qualifications and general fitness of the applicant. These 
supervisors must have had practical and successful experience in teaching, - 
and, in addition, professional training. State funds for the encouragement 
of this work are applicable to every county in the State; however, only a 
‘limited number have taken advantage of it. According to the standardiza- 
tion tests made of the counties in the State, it is observed that those counties 
in which special supervisors have been employed for any length of time are — 
the ones which are standing at the head of the column. 
In 1921 the State expended $8,135.00, which represented about one-third 
of the cost of special supervision employed in Davidson, Greene, Hamilton, 
Henry, Knox, Lawrence, Monroe, Montgomery, Morgan, Robertson, Shelby 
and Weakley counties. The following year $7,445.00 was expended by the 
State, representing about one-third of the cost expended for supervision in 
Davidson, Greene, Hamilton, Hancock, McMinn, Overton, Rutherford, 
Shelby, Union and Weakley counties.

Industrial Teachers for rural schools, and for the extension of terms in a 
limited number of counties having less than ‘six months. 
During the scholastic year ending June 30th, 1921, twenty-four of ‘these 
teachers were employed in 26 counties, representing about 70% of the entire 
egro population of the State. They were paid a total salary of $21,000.00, 
f which $7,540.00 was paid by the State and $6,710.00 by the Jeanes Fund. 
_ The following year twenty-four industrial teachers were employed, and 
operated in twenty-six counties, and received a total salary of $23,310.00, 
$7,350.00 of which was paid by the county, $8,305.00 by the State, and 
$7,655.00 by the Jeanes Board. The contribution made by these workers in 
the interest of better schools, better home conditions, and higher standards 
of living can hardly be overestimated. According to reports covering the 
past year, the sum of $55,470.23 was raised by these teachers for better 
buildings and better school facilities. 
Below is a list of the workers for 1921-22, showing the number of schools 
in each county, the number visited, the term, total number of visits, and 
-amount of money raised.

     EXTENSION oF ScHOoL TERM 
The Jeanes Board, in 1920-21, made an appropriation for the extension of = 
school terms conditioned on the following, and applicable to counties having 
_ five months or less term: 
Whenever a community, through local subscription or by county funds, 
will extend its school term one month, the Jeanes Board agrees to pay for an 
additional month, provided the salary does not exceed $45.00, and provided 
further, that the terms of as many as six schools be extended in each county. — 
This proposition was accepted by the six counties listed below: 
Fayette, Lauderdale, Dyer, Haywood, Rutherford, Tipton. 
In 1921-22, Rutherford, Dyer, and Lauderdale counties qualified to re- 
ceive aid for the extension of terms. Due to the fact that aid was not offered ~ 
to counties-that had previously received aid for the purpose of extension for 
a number of years, only the above mentioned counties qualified. 
    County TRAINING SCHOOLS 
Four new county training schools have been established since 1920, 
making a total of thirteen for the State, all of which have been made possible 
through contributions from the Slater and General Education Board Funds. 
The Slater Fund contributed $500.00 to each for maintenance, with a liberal 
appropriation from the General Education Board for industrial equipment. 
The general aims of these special schools are as follows: 
1. To supply for the county a central public training school, offering at 
least ten grades of work. 
2. To relate the school to the home and farm, preparing the children for 
their life’s work. 
8. To teach the boys and girls how to earn an honest living and to live 
well on what they can earn. 
4. To prepare, ultimately, a few teachers who are in thorough sympathy 
with country life and well qualified not only to teach the pupils the so-called 
fundamentals of an education, but to inspire them to love the country and 
to remain on the farm. 
The following summaries outlined show that the 13 county training schools 
are functioning in the interest of a more practical type of education for the 
negroes throughout the State. The 13 schools range in type from a four to 
twelve-teacher, each provided with a splendid auditorium, and representing 
107 class-rooms. The combined campus area is represented by 56% acres. 
Each school maintains at least 8 elementary grades and ten of the 13 maintain 
10 to 12 standard grades as outlined by the State Department of Public 
Instruction. In these schools there are employed 90 well-trained and capable _ 
teachers to give instruction to 3,905 pupils. The training school property 
of the State aggregates in value $214,021.20, of which $12,825.00 is in land; 
$76,122.83 in buildings, and $25,073.37 in equipment. These figures do not 
include a recently established school in Sumner county, which, when com- — 
pleted and fully equipped, will be easily worth $20,000.00. 
The work in the county training schools is carefully supervised, and is 
meeting the needs of the various communities in which they are located.

Town ScHoots AIDED BY THE SLATER FUND 
In order to help establish industrial departments for the boys and girls 
in the towns, the Slater Fund appropriates a small amount to Tennessee to 
assist in paying the salaries and installing industrial equipment, on condition 
that the public school board will give as much or more from public funds. 
_ The initial appropriation for each school cannot exceed $300.00, but is gen- 
erally not more than $250.00, which amount is diminhed each year for three to 
four years, until finally the entire expense of the department is paid from 
apace funds,

  SUMMER SCHOOLS 
a The General Education Board has given, during the biennial period, 
$3,400.00 in support of summer schools in a number of counties in which 
regular teachers’ courses were offered, for the benefit and instruction of 
teachers who could not attend regular teachers’ summer schools at a distance.

   The General Education Board has also made it possible for a limited num- 
ber of teachers in county training schools and industrial supervisors to attend 
Hampton and Tuskegee Institutes. During the summer of 1921, $800.00 
was appropriated for this purpose, with which a part of the traveling expenses 
of ten selected teachers were paid to Hampton Summer School and twelve to 
Tuskegee Summer School. During the summer of 1922 six teachers were 
sent to Hampton Institute and ten to Tuskegee. The appropriation by the 
General Education Board for this year was $500.00. 
ROSENWALD SCHOOLS 
The Julius Rosenwald Fund, cooperating with the State Department of 
_ Public Instruction, has aided in the construction of 131 negro school buildings 
_ in Tennessee up to and during the biennial period ending June 30th, 1922, 
about 76 of which were constructed prior to 1920. These buildings repre- 
_ sent a pupil capacity of 13,680, teacher capacity, 304, and a total cost of 
_ $512,581.00. They range in type from one to seven- teacher. In addition 
 
-P-A-G-E-277
  Ii 
     
      
  to the school buildings proper, three modern teachers’ homes have been 
erected, at a cost of $8,500.00. 
PLAN FOR DISTRIBUTION OF AID FROM THE JULIUS ROSENWALD FUND FOR 
Buitpinc RuRAL SCHOOLHOUSES IN THE SOUTH 
For the Year Beginning July 1, 1922 and Ending June 30, 1923. 
1. The Julius Rosenwald Fund will cooperate with public school authori- 
ties and other agencies and persons in the effort to provide and equip better 
tural schoolhouses for the negroes of the Southern States, such equipment 
as desks, blackboards, heating apparatus, libraries and toilets being deemed 
of equal importance with the schoolhouses themselves. 
2. The sites and buildings of all schools aided by The Fund shall be the 
property of the public school authorities. 
3. The Trustees of The Fund and the State Department of Education — 
have agreed as to the number of new buildings in the construction of which _ 
they will cooperate. . 
4, The school site must include ample space for playgrounds and for such 
agricultural work as is necessary for the best service of the community. — 
Aid will be granted only when the site meets the approval of the State De- 
partment of Education and the General Field Agent of The Fund. The 
minimum acceptable for a school is two acres. For the eee school more 
land is desirable. 
5. Plans and specifications for every building shall be aierered by the 
General Field Agent before construction is begun. On request from the State 
Department of Education, The Fund will consider it a privilege to furnish 
general suggestions, plans and specifications for schoolhouses. 
6. It is a condition precedent to receiving the aid of The Fund that the 
people of the several communities shall secure, from other sources: to wit— 
from public school funds, private contributions, etc., an amount equal to or 
greater than that provided by The Fund. Labor, land and material may be 
counted as cash at current market values. Money provided by The Fund 
will be available only when the amount otherwise raised, with that to be given — 
by The Fund, is sufficient to complete, equip and furnish the building. 
7. The Fund will deposit with every cooperating State Department of 
Education a sum of money recommended by the General Field Agent to 
constitute working capital, from which the proper State official may make 
disbursements as required. Whenever the State Department reports to the 
General Field Agent any amount or amounts disbursed, with a statement 
. showing that the work has been inspected and approved by an authorized 
representative of the Department, The Fund will replenish its deposit in 
the amount disbursed; if the inspection report is approved. 
8. The amount appropriated by The Fund shall not exceed $500 for a 
one-teacher school, $700 for a two-teacher school, $900 for a three-teacher 
school, $1,100 for a four-teacher school, $1,300 for a five-teacher school, 
$1,500 for a six-teacher school or larger, and $200 for the addition of a class 
room to a Rosenwald School already built. 
9. Aid will be granted toward the construction and equipment of only 
those schools where the term runs at least five consecutive months. 
   
-P-A-G-E-278
—278— 
10. Every community where an application has been approved agrees to 
complete, equip and furnish its school building before June 30th, 1923, other- 
__ wise such application automatically cancels itself. 
i 11. To insure the protection of the property, and to make the schools 
serve the broadest community interests, teachers’ homes should be provided 
_ on the school grounds. In a limited number of selected localities, where the 
_ annual school term is eight months or more, The Fund will consider coopera- 
_ tion in the construction of teachers’ homes, to be completed and furnished to 
_ correspond with the school building. The amount of aid to be given on a 
teachers’ home shall not exceed one-half of the total cost of the building, 
provided the maximum from The Fund shall not exceed $900 for any teachers’ 
home. Just as in the case of school buildings, the teachers’ home must be 
deeded to the public school authorities. It is desirable for each of these homes 
_ to have a bath-room, and, if possible, a bath-tub and wash basin. If there is 
_ ample water supply, a hand-power force pump with a tank can be installed 
at a very small expense, which will furnish water for the bath, a kitchen sink, 
and the home economics room of the school. 
The statistical table below gives the name of the county, school, type, 
cost, etc., of each school erected up to the close of the present biennial period. Ry

THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL REHABILITATION 
To the State Board for Vocational Education: 
The Department of Industrial Rehabilitation of Tennessee respectfully 
submits the following report for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1921, and 
ending June 30, 1922. 
The work of the Department of Industrial Rehabilitation begun under an 
Act of the Legislature in 1921, is to place disabled citizens in suitable courses 
of training which, upon the completion of said courses, will restore them to 
industrial ranks as self-supporting citizens. The legal requirements for eli- 
gibility are as follows: the disabled person must be sixteen years old, or over, 
must have resided in Tennessee for twelve months preceding application for 
training, and must have a disability that handicaps in following a regular 
occupation. The disability does not necessarily have to be incurred in course 
of employment. Persons, both male and female, who are crippled by acci- 
dent or disease, or by congenital defects, are eligible to this training. For 
persons who are eligible, this department provides tuition, books, tools and 
railroad fare from the disabled person’s home to the approved place of 
training. 
The training is being given in approved schools, shops, factories, corpora- ~ 
tions, upon farms and industrial establishments. The courses of training 
include Agriculture, Accounting, Business Management, Pedagogy, Law, 
Medicine, Music, Art, Stenography, Bookkeeping, Mechanical Drafting, 
Salesmanship, Show-card Writing, Dictaphone Operation, Weaving, Chair 
Caning, etc. The type and place of training are determined by the disabled 
person’s age, education, previous experience and physical disability. When- 
ever possible, the training is given in or near the disabled person’s home. 
A letter, dated November 17th, from the Federal Board for Vocational 
Education, makes the following statement in regard to the civilian rehabili- 
tation work throughout the United States

  REPORT OF UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE, KNOXVILLE 
To Honorable J.-B. Brown, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Nash- 
ville, Tennessee: z 
Dear SIR:— 
I submit to you herein a report of the operations of the University of 
Tennessee for the biennial period, 1920-22, together with a statistical and — 
financial statement for the same period. 
The past biennium has amply justified the wisdom of the State in provid- 
ing revenue for its University commensurate with the resources of the State 
and, ina degree, comparable to the revenues of institutions of similar standing 
throughout the South. It represents the first period following the readjust-_ 
ment of our people to conditions approaching those of normal times; and the 
effect of this increased support upon the attendance and the service oppo 
tunities has been most acceptable and gratifying. - 
The training of educational leaders by resident teaching is only one of the 
demands upon a state university. With the advancing complexity and com- 
petition characterizing our civilization, research, or the development of in- 
formation, and extension, or the distribution of this information to the people 
of the entire State, are now recognized as of fundamental and universal im- 
portance. Reliable information for the class room or for the public is based ~ 
upon investigation. Knowledge of plant diseases, taxation, soil poverty, © 
tenancy, highway construction, industrial by-products, crop production, 
marketing, child life, animal development, and government of a state must — 
be secured through efficiently organized departments of the university of 
the commonwealth in which the problems arise. For instance, new diseases — 
and pests are constantly threatening the welfare of the communities of the — 
State. The relief from or control of these must come through investigations 
conducted by the departments of this University. 2 
- There is much emphasis being laid upon the Ameriean problem of the © 
rural elementary school. The problem is not peculiar to Tennessee, but is 
common to all the states ‘of the nation. Where the rural population pre-_ 
dominates the situation is more acute. The conditions have grown out of an - 
economic evolution. Our forefathers are involved. Their vision did not — 
extend beyond the “‘little red school house,” as a place to prepare men for the © 
professions, nor beyond the wooden plow, the sickle and the flail as agricul- 
tural implements, the country store as a commercial center, and the village 
blacksmith shop as an industrial plant. In their day, rivers and the Great 
Lakes were the chief means for transportation. Invention .and industrial 
enterprise, however, have possessed our people; and until the cycle had been 
run the flag of impending difficulty remained unnoticed... 9 2°) 
There is but one way to save the rural. élementary school. : The-com- 
munity supporting it must be made prosperous, and the school definitely: re 
lated to the community’s welfare. The problem is one not of pedagogics bu 
of economics. The experts of the agricultural and engineering experiment 
stations, together with those of the schools of education and“home economics, 
have already begun the work of rehabilitating the rural elementary ‘school. 
Upon them, associated with well-trained state and county officials, the solu-

tion of this problem devolves. ‘The majority of the lands in Tennessee can 
be made to produce Ten Dollars to Fifty Dollars moreperacre thanare now 
being realized. The tax of One Dollar and Fifty Cents per acre will cease to be 
a burden when increased production and economic distribution are an under- 
stood and intelligent part of the operations of every farm of the rural school 
community. Last year over eleven thousand boys and girls of elementary 
_ school grade were enrolled by the University and given continuous instruction 
in agriculture and home-making. Through these boys and girls, their parents 
and their communities were reached in a very definite way. This is one 
approach to the elementary school problem, but the University has other 
plans in operation that are eventually to give stabilization to the rural school, 
and bring to its community that prosperity and wealth of health and con- 
tentment which shall save our civilization, both rural and urban. 
- The biennium that has just closed has erected a new milestone in the in- 
stitution’s history. The facilities afforded by the new buildings and the 
additional equipment have established pride and confidence in -the students 
and public alike in the purposes and ideals of a great university program. 
The spirit of cooperation on the part of the State departments, school and 
county officials, of individuals and communities, and of the other colleges of 
the State, is an evidence of the genuineness of the University’s obligation to 
all the people. What has been accomplished is but a beginning. The plans 
and projects of the Board of Trustees deal with the future of the State as 
well asthe present. The faculties of the colleges are preparing their programs 
‘for a decade or more in advance, believing that productive research and 
education for the development of Tennessee’s soils, mines, industries, com- 
merce, homes, system of distribution, and citizenship shall never want for 
adequate moral and financial support. 
The organization through which these plans and projects are to be carried 
forward is here outlined.

CoLLEcE oF LiBERAL ARTS 
Nowhere in the State University ideal are the elements of research, resi- 
dent teaching, and extension teaching more essential for a proper plan of 
public service than in the College of Liberal Arts. Moreover, there is no 
_ part of a state university organization so necessary as the facilities afforded 
by the Liberal Arts College. Its service is fundamental to the proper opera- 
tion of the colleges and schools concerned with the applied arts and sciences. 
To develop a program of improvement in animal husbandry, for instance, 
without the information discovered in the zoological and botanical and the 
chemical and physical laboratories and imparted through the teachers of 
these subjects would be as impossible as an attempt to develop a sound body 
without an adequate knowledge of food values and physical exercise. No 
more can the several fields of medicine and health progress without the funda- 
mental facts furnished through the departments of chemistry and bacteriology 
and other fundamental sciences; or the other branches of applied knowledge 
be promoted without the basic facts which come from the various depart- 
ments of the College of Liberal Arts. 
Liberal Arts research has for its task the finding of such information and 
principles as are necessary for both resident teaching and non-resident or 
extension teaching, in all the branches of knowledge. It is the function of 
resident teaching in Liberal Arts to assemble resident students, to enable them 
to discover themselves and to train them, and through its instruction to these 
students to carry better principles of citizenship over to the people of the . 
State. Extension teaching in Liberal Arts provides direct practical service to 
. those citizens of the Commonwealth who are unable to spend a period of time 
in the University for instruction. 
The approximation of this ideal represents the efforts of the College of 
Liberal Arts for the past two years. The chart which follows demonstrates 
the relation which the Liberal Arts College in its three-fold function has main- 
tained to the other colleges and schools in this University.

Homer Economics 
The welfare of the 519,108 families of the State of Tennessee will be very 
materially affected by the mothers who head these families. To the De- 
partment of Home Economics is delegated the task of training the women of 
the State through leaders in all phases of home life. In 1920, there were 
1,163,918 women and girls in Tennessee. However carefully these may be 
trained for professional and other activities of life, the ultimate goal of wo- 
ianhood is the home. Through the extension work of the University the 
homes already established may be reached, but leaders for the future must be

developed. The demands upon the University’s accommodations for women 
are increasing in a perplexing ratio. Expansions and reorganizations have 
been arranged, but these will be entirely inadequate in the very near future. 
Among the expansions the increased facilities of the practice house, where 
the Seniors in Home Economics receive adequate training in the exercise of 
the fundamentals learned in the class-room, the concentration of the man- 
agement of the several girls’ dormitories and dining halls under a trained 
member of the Home Economics faculty, giving ample opportunity for girls 
to attend to the details of housekeeping under adequate supervision and at the 
same time defray a part of the expenses of their college careers, and the addi- 
tion of a teacher trainer in Smith-Hughes Home Economics, who will also do 
field work, may be mentioned. 
$ Scuoot or Epucation 
Since the last biennial report this School has continued its efforts in 
a constructive way in the training of teachers and in helping to carry forward 
the general educational work of the State. There has been an increase of 
more than forty per cent in enrollment. Moreover, the Summer Session en- 
rolls more than seven hundred teachers, in addition to the several hundred 
otherregular students. Most of these teachers are people of experience. Thirty- 
five, during the past summer, were graduate students working for advanced 
degrees. A Department of Rural Education has been added during the last 
_ twelve months, and is now organizing for the rehabilitation of the rural ele- 
      ‘ 
         mentary school. A Spring Short Term for Teachers has also been added as a 
means of relieving the shortage of qualified teachers in the State, with grati- 
fying results. Degree credits are allowed for work in this short term. Other 
constructive measures will be undertaken as rapidly as facilities will permit 
for the development of this important phase of university work. 
The School of Commerce likewise has been expanded, to meet the de- 
mand for men trained in the fields of finance, business management, mar- 
keting and accounting. An additional professor for each of the fields of 
marketing and accounting has been added to the staff of this School, and read- 
justments of courses have been effected which place it in the front rank among 
like schools in the universities of the South. 
COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE 
The economic upheaval that has taken place since the war has produced 
problems difficult of solution. The basic position of agriculture in the na- 
tion’s existence has not been realized by the majority of our citizens, urban 
‘and rural. The depression that has prevailed has been universal. Never- 
theless, the trend of press and public discussion has centered around so-called 
“big business.”’ The basic industry of agriculture, poorly organized for 
competition, has suffered out of proportion. This condition has forced 
problems for the solution of which there is no precedent. The college or- 
ganization, comprising the experiment station staff, the teaching faculty and 
the extension forces, has had to meet this new economic setting by readjust- 
ments of plans and projects. Profitable production is so intimately con- 
nected with marketing facilities and opportunities that sudden adjustments 
are impossible, which has prolonged the distress in many agricultural sec- 
gi tions. The effect of these conditions has been the discouragement of agri- 
cultural education and a general turning away from the businessof farming.
-P-A-G-E-310
  
310—~ 
Disheartened parents have either not been able to send their children to col- 
lege or have discouraged their taking agricultural training. This atmos- 
phere has permeated our rural communities, and has caused a very noticeable 
reduction in the portion of the State’s population living in rural communities, 
an index of the dangerous swing of people toward the cities. Tennessee’s 
rural population has decreased from 79.8% of the total population in 1910 to 
73.9% of the total in 1920. During this decade, although the urban popula- 
tion has increased 25%, the rural population has increased a little more than 
1%. ; 
The University has gone to the crux of this problem. Some of the more 
than 1,600 lines of inquiry and extension teaching have been indicated else- 
where. But they can better be illustrated than enumerated. Asidé from 
economic distribution, increased production and the maintenance -of soil 
fertility are fundamental. The University is attacking these propositions in 
-two ways: (a) the producing power of the soil is being improved; and (b) more 
prolific strains of the staple crops are being introduced. Every soil in the 
State is under chemical control and analysis in the experiment stations. 
These analyses are followed by experiments designed to adapt soil improvement 
methods to the soil characteristics. The University’s investigation of the 
lime problem illustrates a method of approach to soil improvement. An illus- 
tration of the introduction of more prolific strains of staple crops is the use of 
improved strains: of corn, disease-resistant red clover and tomatoes, beardless 
barley, and lespedeza. The Experiment Station for years has been testing and 
improving the different varieties of corn suitable for Tennessee, with the re- 
sult that the Division of Agricultural Extension was instructed to encourage 
the wide use of a particular variety. A study made this last year disclosed 
the fact that this one effort has increased the corn yield by two and one-half 
million bushels, or One Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars, at a 
Seventy Cents price of corn. This method, experimentation followed by the 
extension of the practical knowledge gained to the entire State, is one of the 
State University’s answers to the unrest of our rural communities. The 
University’s program of experiment and extension in agriculture covers every 
phase of the rural home and community life, and is undoubtedly going far 
toward the relief of these conditions of unrest. 
It is the task of resident agricultural teaching to send back to the rural 
community leaders and agriculturists to consolidate the. vantage points at- 
tained through these improvements in living conditions. It is the function, 
too, of resident teaching as carried on at the University, based on proper re- 
search and coordinated with extension teaching, to inspire that vision which 
inevitably results in the development of new and improved phases of agri- 
cultural industry in the State. 
TEACHER TRAINING IN VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE, Home ECONOMICS AND 
TRADES AND INDUSTRIES 
The Teacher Training in Home Economics and in Trades and Industries 
has been referred to elsewhere. The cordial relationship which has existed 
between the State Department of Education and the University departments 
concerned with these types of work has very largely facilitated their progress. 
We wish to speak specifically of the work in Teacher Training in Vocational 
Agriculture. It has now been three years since the work was undertaken, 
and there are fifty-five teachers of vocational agriculture in as many schools;

  eighteen in West Tennessee, twenty-one in Middle Tennessee, and sixteen in 
East Tennessee. The enrollment in these schools for the past year was five 
thousand fifty-three. In addition to resident training of agricultural teachers, 
the University has maintained a close relationship with these schools through 
itinerant teachers, whose business it has been to train the agricultural teach- 
ers in the field. Conferences and short courses have also been conducted at 
the University. Much research has been done by the department, resulting 
in the accumulation of considerable data and the formulation of plans for 
_ teaching this subject in this State; and these materials are being published in 
bulletin form for the guidance of agricultural teachers. 
THE COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING 
Marked progress has been made by the College of Engineering during the 
_ past two years; reporting’an increase of sixteen per cent in attendance, a 
considerable increase in students enrolled in graduate courses, the organiza- 
tion of the Engineering Experiment Station, an extensive service to disabled 
soldiers through the Vocational School, and the completion of details prepara- 
tory to the offering of home study courses of instruction in engineering sub- 
jects to the men employed in the industries of the State. 
The College of Engineering is supplying a larger number of young men 
trained for the industries of the State each year, and the graduates of the 
College are in an increasing ratio being absorbed by these-industries. Fully 
one-half of the highway engineers doing work in Tennessee received their 
technical training at the University. The Professor of Industrial Education, 
associated with the State Supervisor of Industrial Education, is conducting 
_ conferences in shops and factories, for the training of foremen, with excel- 
lent results. 
: The Engineering College is devoting itself in the most cordial way to the 
_ assistance of those in charge of the promotion of highway building in this 
State. The East Tennessee district office of the State Department is housed 
in the Engineering Building, with sufficient floor space for drafting rooms. 
_ The State Highway Department makes daily use of the University labora- 
tories, testing all of the sand, rock and steel used in the State on Federal aid 
projects, thus saving the State many thousands of dollars in investment, and 
the yearly rental of working quarters. Engineering students frequently find 
part-time employment in this work, and many worthy young men are enabled 
to earn a part of their expenses in the highway drafting room. Each year the 
engineers of the Highway Department assist in conducting the annual Short 
Course for Road Builders, held in January and February. 
The Engineering Experiment Station, started without funds, has received 
tbstantial support from the coal and zinc producers of the country. These 
funds are now being used to investigate qualities of the coal and for study of 
oncrete made from the crushed stone refuse from zinc mining. Cooperating 
ith the Federal Government, with the State Highway Department and with 
le county highway officials, the Professor of Civil Engineering has made a 
aluable study of highway economics, to determine what investment may be 
made on a highway project when the traffic conditions are known. _ ;

     THE COLLEGE OF LAW 
_ The College of Law has been reorganized and is conducting its. work ac- ording to the requirements of the American Association of Law Schools, of yhich it is a member. *

    This College is maintaining the highest ideals of the legal profession in its 
resident teaching. The course of study comprises three years of work based 
on a minimum of one year preliminary collegiate study in Liberal Arts, and 
the system of instruction is that followed by the best law colleges of the land: 
viz, the case system. It is consistently working toward the further ideals of 
serving the members of the bar throughout the State by giving to the profession 
the results of study and investigation conducted by the College, of publishing 
for them the Law Review devoted to these materials, and of cooperating with 
them in maintaining the best intellectual and ethical standards of the pro- 
fession. It further is the purpose of the College to serve the entire citizen- 
ship of the State, whenever called upon, by drafting and criticizing proposed 
bills so as to avoid constitutional defects, and by otherwise placing its facil- 
ities at their disposal. 
‘THE VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION DEPARTMENT 
The Vocational Rehabilitation Department is operated by the University 
in cooperation with the U. S. Veteran’s Bureau for the purpose of retraining 
disabled ex-service men and returning them to profitable employment. 
The trainees are divided into three groups: professional, agricultural and 
trade. The professional group is composed of men who have completed high 
school and are able to present the necessary entrance credits to a regular — 
four years college course. The other two groupsare composed of men below — 
high school grade, and special two years courses have been arranged for them. 
These courses lead to different job objectives and are thoroughly practical. 
The following are the agricultural objectives toward which men are being 
trained: live stock herdsman, dairyman, cow tester, dairy manufacturer,’ 
poultryman, bee keeper, general farmer, orchardman and market gardener. 
During the early stages of these courses the work is somewhat theoretical, 
much of it being done in the class-room. During the last nine or twelve _ 
months, however, very little work is done in the class-room, as the student — 
spends practically all of his time on a farm project, which is as nearly like the 
job he intends to handle when he has finished his training as it can be made. 
The trade group is being trained toward the following objectives: ma- 
chinist, pattern maker, house wirer, armature winder, stationary engineer, 
mechanical draftsman, highway surveyor and auto mechanic. The men in 
this group go to work at seven o’clock in the morning and work in the shop at 
as nearly production speed as possible until twelve o’clock. The afternoons — 
are given over to the related subjects of English, mathematics and drawing. 
The shops, so far as possible, are run like industrial plants, in order to give 
the men an atmosphere similar to that in which they will work when they 
have finished their training. ; 
The work of the Vocational Department has been in progress about three 
years, and a number of men have been rehabilitated, and a larger number 
will be rehabilitated in the very near future. One of the trainees has a 
responsible position as manager of one of the largest commercial orchards 
in the State; another is managing a creamery at forty dollars per week; — 
another is chief of production in an ice-cream plant, and receiving a wage of — 
thirty-five dollars per week; a fourth is located at Memphis, Tennessee, as 
branch manager of one of the largest distributors of apiary supplies in the — 
United States, and others are making splendid successes in their respective 2 
lines of work.

CoLLEGES oF MEDICINE AND DENTISTRY AND SCHOOL OF PHARMACY 
Changes, adjustments, faculty additions, increased equipment, co-ordina- 
tion with public health agencies and a much larger student enrollment feature 
the conditions prevalent in these two years in the Memphis Departments of 
the University, the College of Medicine, the College of Dentistry and the 
School of Pharmacy. Cooperating in the new laboratory building erected 
last year are the following agencies: the malarial research laboratory of the 
United States Health Service, the West Tennessee laboratory of the State 
Board of Health, the laboratories of the Memphis Department of Health, 
and the pathological and bacteriological laboratories of the University, form- 
ing an institution of unusual merit in the promotion of disease investigation 
and medical teaching. 
The University has reorganized its laboratories and equipment in the 
Dental College, in an effort to meet the acute demand for more dentists with- 
in the State. The tabular arrangement of the results of a recent study (given 
below) discloses the situation for which this reorganization must provide. 
In consideration of the fact that the community which one dentist can 
serve should certainly be not larger than three thousand people, this table is 
startling, to say the least, in its revelations. There are ten counties in the 
State, approximately 71,400 people, that have no dentist; there are three 
counties, approximately 83,300 people, where one dentist must serve 15,000 
people or more; there are eight counties, approximately 101,900 people, with 
10,000 people for each dentist; seven counties, approximately 112,500 people, 
with only one dentist for each group of 7,000 people; there are fifteen counties, 
_ 290,700 people, with a dentist for every 5,500 people; and twenty counties, 
or 443,800 people, with 4,000 people for each dentist; while only sixteen 
counties have an adequate supply of dentists, according to the standard given 
_ above, with sixteen other counties in a very doubtful category. Rectifying 
this situation is the task the Dental College has set for itself.

Reticious Work 
Practically seventy per cent of the men in the University, together with 
all the women in the dormitories of the University, were enrolled in the re- 
ligious work of the Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A. during the past year, and 
the enrollment in religious activities for the preceding year of the biennium 
was about the same. There were twenty men in the Christian Life Service 
Band, a body preparing for Christian service as a life occupation and meet- 
ing bi-weekly throughout the’ year. Of the young women, there were ap- 
proximately seventy-five engaged in Bible study and mission and settlement 
work. The work of the two religious organizations is quite comprehensive, 
involving the improvement of the social relations of the students as well as 
the maintenance of a high moral and religious atmosphere on the campus. 
Of much importance is the church census promoted each year for the pur- 
pose of enlisting the interests of the students in the activities of those churches 
representing the denominations with which they were affiliated at home. 
All the work of the year points toward the evangelistic services conducted in 
the spring. At the meeting held in the spring of 1922 there were one hun- 
dred fifty students who consecrated themselves to Christian living, together 
with fifty who made the decision to enter some form of Christian service as 
their life work. 
ANNOUNCEMENT OF GIFTS

STATE SUPPORT 
Taxes for the support of the service indicated in the foregoing paragraphs 
(and the service of the University of Tennessee in promoting wealth produc- 
tion, health and contentment, as well as in developing leadership, can only be 
indicated in a brief report) are not burdens, but profitable investments. 
With the investments which this State is now making through its State 
University, the Board of Trustees may for the first time in the history of the 
institution undertake its program of adequate service to the State with a 
|} hopeful outlook. That you may more fully appreciate the significance of 
state support, a chart representing the rank of the several Southern States in 
“appropriations for the maintenance of State University education and ser- 
vice (research, extension teaching and resident teaching) has been prepared. 
This chart shows graphically the number of dollars per thousand white in- 
habitants the several states have appropriated for 1922-23, and also the aver- 
‘| age number of dollars per thousand white inhabitants for the United States 
as a whole in 1920-21. Obviously, from the place occupied by Tennessee, 
this state is obtaining its university service, under the present tax, on a more 
_} economical basis than the rest of the country.

New Bvi_prncs 
Four new buildings, costing about $150,000.00, are in the course of con- 
struction, and all will be completed before the opening of the winter quarter, 
1923. These buildings will greatly enlarge the facilities of the school, and 
will contribute to its usefulness. The funds for the new buildings were pro- 
-vided by bond issue authorized by the General Assembly of the State, and 
these buildings have been erected under the management and supervision of 
the State Board of Education. 
Men’s Dormitory. This building, of fire-proof construction, contains 
fifty double bed-rooms with closets, society hall, reception room, bath rooms, 
trunk-rooms, and servants’ quarters. Each bed-room is supplied with win- 
dow shades, bedsteads, springs, mattresses, dresser, table and chairs. The 
building is heated with steam, lighted by electricity, and supplied with hot 
and cold water. 
Gymnasium. This is a brick, concrete and steel building, modern in its 
planning and perfectly lighted and ventilated. Its playing court is 50x70 
feet, and its galleries will seat 1,000. It contains apparatus room, directors’ 
rooms, and has ample dressing rooms and lockers for men and women. 
Library. This building contains a general reading and reference room, 
30x100 feet, stack room for 10,000 volumes; assembly and class rooms, and 
has perfect lighting and ventilation. Its architecture is attractive, and it is 
of concrete, stone and brick construction. 
Industrial Arts Building. The old cafeteria has been remodeled and con- 
verted into an industrial arts building. It is 100 feet long and 40 feet wide, 
with brick veneer walls and asbestos shingle roof. It contains machinery, 
mechanical drawing, lecture and supply rooms, and more than double the 
space formerly used by the manual training department. 
Other Additions. The old library room in the main building will be used 
as a class room. The old gymnasium has been converted into chemistry 
laboratories, providing space for ample lecture room, laboratories for general 
and advanced chemistry, supply rooms, lockers, and waiting rooms. The 4 
_ old chemistry rooms have been supplied with new equipment, and will be —         
    
-P-A-G-E-337
  —337— 
used by the biology and agriculture departments. Additional equipment and 
apparatus will be supplied, and these important departments will be made 
modern in every way. 
A new concrete silo, 10x30 feet, has been erected at the school barn. A 
dairy house with concrete floors and troughs and equipped with modern 
apparatus has been provided. New concrete walks and macadamized road- — 
ways will be built leading to all the new buildings. 
Campus. Much attention is being given to the beautifying of the grounds 
and parks, which, by their natural attractiveness, offer exceptional oppor- 
tunity for artistic landscape gardening. More than thirty-five hundred 
trees and shrubs contribute much to the natural beauty of the grounds. One 
mile of macadamized roadway has been built, setting off to the best advantage 
the beauty of the buildings, campus and park. 
    NEEDS OF THE SCHOOL 
The needs of the school may be classed under two heads: material and 
social. Some of the material needs of the school, as they appear at the present 
time, are as follows: 
(a) An Additional Dormitory for Women. The dormitory for women now 
in use accommodates 115 women. This meets the demand of the institution 
only during the fall quarter. For the remainder of the school year, beginning 
January 1, many young women must find rooms in private homes at great 
additional expense and much inconvenience. While it could not be expected 
that dormitory room will be provided for the very large number of women 
who come during the summer quarter, the dormitories should be ample enough 
to accommodate all who attend during the regular year. An additional dor- 
mitory to accommodate 150 women is now needed. 
  (6) Kitchens and Cafeterias. Our present kitchens and cafeterias will — 
comfortably take care of 400 boarders. Additional room should be provided, 
and must be provided if the students are to be properly cared for in this im- 
portant department during the spring and summer quarters. If in the dor- | 
mitory recommended for women a kitchen and cafeteria should be provided 
for all the women in the dormitories, leaving the old kitchen and cafeteria for _ 
all other students, I believe the arrangement would be satisfactory and eco- 
nomical. 
  (c) Laundry. At the present time only limited provisions have been 
made for laundry. A building sufficient for this purpose and properly equip- 
ped should be provided. ‘This is not only desirable from an economic stand- 
point, but from a hygienic one as well. It seems to me that this is an impera- 
tive need of the school at the present time. 
  (d) Athletics and Grand Stand. The new gymnasium will greatly enlarge 
the facilities of the Normal School for health education, recreation and play; _ 
but if this important department is to be enlarged as it should be, an athletic 
field should be developed, with a suitable grandstand and seating accommoda- . 
tions. : 
  (e) Barn. While some improvements and enlargements have been made 
_ on the school barn, additional room is needed. The barn we now have should 
be enlarged to at least twice its present capacity. 
 
-P-A-G-E-338

SoctaL NEEDS 
(a) Department of Home Study and Correspondence Work. The Confer- 
ence of Superintendents at its annual session at the State Normal School 
on June 21, 22 and 23, adopted the following resolution: 
“We believe that teachers in service should be encouraged to improve their 
educational efficiency, insofar as they may be able to do so without interfering 
with their daily tasks as teachers. We recommend that the State Normal 
School establish a Department of Home Study and Correspondence Work, 
and that such teachers as may meet the requirements in such a department 
shall be permitted to work out credits in the Normal School. We believe 
that such a department of correspondence study would encourage hundreds 
of teachers in East Tennessee to pursue helpful professional courses while 
engaged in teaching, and would later encourage the resident attendance of 
such teachers at the Normal School.” 
The establishment of such a department would enable hundreds, if not 
thousands of teachers to carry on, in connection with their school work, 
professional courses that would add to their efficiency and contribute to their 
working out Normal School certificates and diplomas. Departments of cor- 
respondence work have been established in nearly all universities, colleges, 
and normal schools; and approval by the State Board of Education of the 
recommendation made by the Conference of Superintendents would contrib- 
ute very largely to the usefulness of the school. 
(b) A Strengthened Course of Study. At the present time the State Normal 
Schools offer courses of study eae to certificates and diplomas and teachers’ 
license as follows: 
(1) The One-Year or Conical? Course of Study. On the completion of 
this course, the student receives the certificate of the Normal School, and a 
first-class elementary teacher’s license. 
(2) The Two-Year Normal Course of Study. On the completion of this 
course of study, the student receives a Normal School certificate, and is issued 
a first-grade high school license, good in schools below first class. 
(3) The Three-Year Normal Course of Study. On the completion of this 
course, the student receives a diploma of the Normal School, and is granted 
first-class high school license, good in the department in which the student 
‘has done major or minor work. 
These three courses are intended to supply teachers for elementary schools, 
both rural and city, high schools below first class, and high schools of the 
first class. 
Additional courses should be provided as follows: 
(1) Rural Elementary Teachers. A special course of study designed for 
those who expect to become efficient teachers in rural schools should be pro- 
vided. This course would be differentiated somewhat from the present one- 
year certificate course, and should require at least four quarters for graduation 
above the completion of a standard high school course. 
(2) Fourth-Year Normal Course. The Normal School should give a four- 
year course of study leading to the bachelor’s degree. Those who complete 
this course should be authorized, by law, to receive, under general regulations, 
license for a county superintendent and license to engage in vocational work 
in agriculture, home economics, and manual training for such students as 
had majored in these departments. 
While the Fourth-Year Normal Course would not, for a while at least,
-P-A-G-E-339
        39 
  include a large number of students, it would give opportunity for those who 
desire to complete their professional training and receive a bachelor’s degree 
to do so in the school in which they had completed three years of college work. | 
At the present time quite a number of the graduates of the Normal School, 
after completing the three-year course of study, attend Peabody College, the 
University of Tennessee, or some other college or university for the additional 
year necessary to earn a degree. This opportunity should be offered in the 
State Normal Schools. Such addition would not weaken, in any way, the 
Certificate Course of Study, the Two-Year Course, or the Three-Year Normal 
Course, but would rather strengthen these departments, which would always _ 
include the larger number of students. The tendency at the present time is 
to authorize Normal Schools to confer the bachelor’s degree. During the 
past few years many Normal Schools have been converted into teachers’ 
colleges; and, in my judgment, the Normal Schools of Tennessee would be 
made more useful, and the cause of public education would be strengthened, 
by the addition of a fourth year to the present three-year course of study, 
and the conversion of the State Normal Schools into State teachers’ colleges. 
This change should be accompanied by the requirement that the entrance 
requirements at the State teachers’ colleges should be graduation from a 
four-year high school, giving at least 15 units of standard high school work. 
‘The elimination of the two years of high school work now given, and the addi- 
tion of one year to the Normal Schools, could be made without the employ- 
ment of any additional teachers in the Normal School faculties.

Our facilities have been very much increased recently by the addition of | : 
a number of new buildings which have been needed for a number of years. 
Our building program made possible by the bond issue is about complete. 
These buildings include an up-to-date dormitory for men, with all modern 
conveniences, consisting of about seventy-five rooms. This building is lo- 
cated east of the administration building, corresponding in position with the 
girls’ dormitory, and having a similar appearance to that building. 
A long-felt want has been supplied in the erection of our new gymnasium 
and physical training department. This building is now nearing completion 
and will be ready for occupancy by the middle of November. It will be well 
equipped with all needed appliances so as to give this institution one of the 
best gymnasiums in the State. This building is located in the rear of the 
auditorium, and very accessible to both the boys’ and girls’ dormitories. 
A new laundry has also been constructed and will soon be ready for use. 
We have not yet supplied the necessary machinery to put this department in 
operation, but this will prove to be a very valuable asset to the institution. 
_ We expect by the first of December to have our equipment installed so as to
-P-A-G-E-344
oat 
   do all the laundry work of the school, and we then will be relieved of the em- 
a barrassment of having our students to send their clothes to various negro 
houses for the purpose of laundering. 
We also have built a new dairy barn, large enough to care for fifty cows. 
_ This barn will be used not only for practical purposes in developing a first 
class dairy, but will also be used for demonstration purposes in our agricul- 
tural department. It is equipped with the most modern appliances and built 
upon the most up-to-date plans. Very few dairy barns in the State surpass 
_ this upon the beauty of its structure, convenience of its arrangements, and 
_ the adaptability for the purpose of work on the farm and the school. It is 
located near the farm residence, and adds very much to the attractiveness of 
the Normal School property. 
____ In addition to the new buildings enumerated above, the State Board of 
_ Education has purchased the large dormitory located on the west side of the 
_ Normal Boulevard to be used as a practice house and dormitory for girls. 
This will take care of 45 or 50 girls comfortably. It has been remodeled so 
as to make it convenient, attractive and suitable for that purpose. 
Our Model and Practice School is at the present time being taught in the 
east end of the administration building. About six rooms are being used for 
_ that purpose. About one hundred students have been enrolled and this is a 
sufficient number to give the student-teachers observation and practice in 
the work of teaching. The Model and Practice School of a Normal School is 
really a part of the institution. This is the place where the student-teacher 
puts into practice the theory given them in the class room, and no Normal 
School is complete without an up-to-date and well equipped Model and 
Practice School. Our needs are seemingly well supplied, but the next ob- 
jective should be the building of a modern building on the Normal School 
campus for this purpose. It need not be a pretentious building, but should 
cost from $15,000.00 to $20,000.00, and be sufficient to take care of all the 
grades the students of the Normal School will have to teach when they have 
finished their courses. This building is also made necessary by the fact that 
the rooms now being used for that purpose in the administration building are 
- needed for the regular work of the school. 
Our library should be enlarged by the addition of a room on either side 
of it. Ina few years the room now being occupied by the library will not be 
sufficient in size to accommodate the number of students who use it. The li- 
_ brary should also be enriched by a number of needed books. At least $1,000 
should be spent each year in the purchase of new books and magazines that 
the library may be kept up-to-date. _ 
E The work of the new year, 1922-23, has started out full of promise. Our 
attendance has increased and the character of the student body has im- 
proved. We confidently look to the future with all possible pride in develop- 
ing a great institution which will serve the needs of the State. We are 
grateful to the faculty, the student body and the friends of education for 
making this success possible. The State Department of Education has 
_ always been ready to render any service possible in cooperating with the 
_ work of the school to bring about the desired success. 
Thanking you for this splendid cooperation, and the assistance which 
_ you have given during your administration, I am 
                        
  Very truly yours,

FINANCIAL 
During the year beginning September 1, 1921, and ending August 31, 1922, 
this school has received a local revenue of $67,929.89. It has spent of this 
amount $65,877.28, a portion of which has been applied to the settlement of 
bills contracted before the beginning of the year. 
From state revenues, the school has received $96,022.58, and has ex- 
pended $77,603.08. 
IMPROVEMENTS 
Three new buildings are nearing completion on the West Tennessee State 
Normal campus. 
The new dining hall and kitchen are beautifully appointed. 
The dormitory for men will be ready for occupancy at an early date. 
Due to the increased attendance of men students, it is evident that every 
room in that building will be occupied. The building is fireproof in construc- 
tion, and contains fifty double bed-rooms, commodious closets, a large recep- 
tion hall or lobby, and ample bath rooms. It will be heated with steam, 
lighted by electricity, and supplied with hot and cold water. 
The new power plant will furnish heat, light and water for the various 
buildings on the campus. The second floor of this building will be devoted 
entirely to the use of the school laundry. 
Recently a new well was sunk on the campus, which guarantees a yield 
of more than a million gallons of water per day, whenever such a supply 
might be required. 
NEEDS 
The institution needs a practice school and a gymnasium. 
With a well equipped, modern practice school, the opportunities afforded 
the young men and young women who annually attend the West Tennessee 
State Normal School would be unlimited. 
The emphasis which is being laid on physical education throughout the 
country, and the interest which is being manifested in this branch of study by 
students everywhere, suggest that the Normal School should have an up-to- 
date gymnasium. 
CoNcLUSION 
Considering the facts set forth in the foregoing report, I am happy to 
inform you that the West Tennessee State Normal is in excellent condition 
and is progressing satisfactorily in all.departments. 
Respectfully, 
  A. A. Kincannon, President.

This work has met with unusual success. Many students have advanced 
from the first grade of an elementary education to the high school grades in 
this brief time, and in addition have learned a practical trade or vocation. 
Others, who had formerly engaged in profitable occupations but who were 
prevented from following their previous vocation because of the nature of 
their disability, have learned new trades which they will continue with profit 
and enjoyment for the remainder of their lives. 
The work of this entire department, which has been unique in its organ- 
ization and execution, was considered an experiment of the Government in- 
the beginning, but it has become a definitely worked out system of training, 
and is becoming a splendid object lesson in vocational training for all insti- 
tutions of learning, and especially schools of technology and vocational 
education. 
ImpRovEMENTS, 1920-22 
Dormitory and Administration Building 
During the past two years the institution has added to its plant several _ 
buildings. A dormitory for women has been erected at a cost of more than _ 
$50,000.00. This building will accommodate 125 students. The adminis- 
tration building has been enlarged by the addition of nine class rooms and 
laboratories, and a new auditorium. These additions to the administration 
building cost approximately $45,000.00. Both the dormitory and adminis- 
tration building were erected with funds received from the last issue of State 
bonds, of which this institution received $100,000.00. 
These additions partially relieve the overcrowded condition which the 
school has experienced for several years, and makes possible the installation 
of modern equipment in the chemistry and physics departments, and in the 
biology and home economics laboratories. The auditorium will seat about 
1,000 persons, and is adequate for the present. ’

  Farm 
In the summer and fall of 1921 a new dairy barn was erected on the farm, 
and a herd of nine pure-bred Jersey cows purchased. During the past year 
the barn has been completed and several additional animals purchased, so 
that now the herd totals twenty. The farm has been divided into pastures; 
fences have been erected; lime and manure added to the soil until it now 
‘produces well, and furnishes a model demonstration of an ideal farm, with ~ 
sufficient pasturage and a complete system of drainage, a beautiful herd of 
hogs, and an up-to-date poultry plant. There has also been added to the 
farm equipment a poultry laboratory plant, in which may be found five yards 
containing modern houses and five different breeds of fowls. Many other 
breeds of poultry are also studied in the laboratories. The school is well 
prepared to teach poultry husbandry effectively, and to supply the community 
with standard breeds. A 
  Mecuanics Arts DEPARTMENT 
_ Buildings z 
A new steel building, ideally lighted and ventilated, for the housing and 
operation of machinery, has been added during the past year. This building - 
covers 10,000 square feet of floor space and houses the Auto Mechanics De- 
partment, Cabinet Making Department, Manual Training Department, 
and Shoe Repairing Department. 
Equipment 
In regard to equipment, the school has purchased a number of machines 
and tools for the various departments and also has in custody a magnificent 
assortment of machinery of the United States Government for the training 
_ of ex-service men in the Rehabilitation Section. 
NEEDS OF THE SCHOOL 
The school is not adequately equipped, either with buildings or machinery. 
In the first place, much of the machinery and equipment being used at 
present is housed in wooden buildings hastily constructed by students of the 
_ S.A.T.C. The lighting and ventilation are poor and the heating expensive 
aaand inefficient because of the necessity of using stoves. 
Mechanic Arts Building . 
A new modern brick mechanic arts building should be erected in front of 
tttithe new shop building. In this building should be provided lecture rooms, 
nrnimechanical drawing rooms, electrical laboratories, class rooms, drying rooms, — 
FFF|paint rooms, study rooms, and laboratory space for instruction in manual 
ttt training, hydraulics, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering, and 
aaaiall subjects which are now being taught in the old wooden building. 
Dining Hall 
At present the dining hall and kitchen space is located in the basement 
ccc of the east dormitory. This extends several feet below the surface of the eg ground, making lighting and ventilation very poor and unsatisfactory, be- sss sides being entirely too small. A new dining hall should be erected at a ccc central location with reference to the dormitories now constructed and those 
ttt to be built in the future.
-P-A-G-E-352
  —352— 
Provisions should be made in this building for the installation of modern 
equipment for the kitchen, including storage space and a refrigeration plant, 
quarters for servants, etc. 
Central Heating Plant 
At present the heating apparatus of this institution consists of five fur- 
naces in the basements of the different buildings, in rooms that are incon- 
veniently located and adjacent to storage rooms for coal that are inadequate 
in capacity. In addition to these five furnaces, it is necessary to keep in 
operation at least twenty-five stoves in the buildings not provided with steam 
heat to make them comfortable. The cost of the coal and the expense of 
firing these stoves and furnaces, together with the unavoidable waste, would 
amply justify the installation of a central heating plant in connection with 
which should be installed a laundry. The approximate cost of this plant 
would be $25,000.00. 
Beautifying Grounds 
The institution is also badly in need of a fund to build a system of drive- 
ways and walks on the campus and for the planting of shrubbery, setting of 
trees and otherwise beautifying the buildings and grounds. 
CONCLUSION ~ 
The administration of Tennessee Polytechnic Institute is highly gratified 
with the progress made during the past two years, which, briefly summarized, 
represents an increase in value of the school plant, in the form of buildings, 
live stock, fences, machinery, and laboratory apparatus, of more than $200,- 
000.00; an increase in the enrollment of more than thirty-three and one- 
third per cent; and an increase in the number of graduates of at least thirty- 
three and one-third per cent. 
These results have been brought about by the close cooperation of the 
State Board of Education, the Superintendent of Public Instruction, members 
of the faculty, and friends and patrons of the school; to all of whom we wish 
to express our warmest appreciation. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Q. M. Situ, President.

REPORT OF THE TENNESSEE AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOL : 
The establishment of this school for Negroes was authorized by an Act of 
the State Legislature in 1909, under what is known as the General Education 
Bill, which provided an annual appropriation for the maintenance of such a 
school for the colored people of the State. Z 
The avowed purpose of this institution is to train a body of efficient 
teachers and leaders to meet fully the demands for practical service in the 
various schools and communities of Tennessee. The founders and sup- 
porters of this institution were not able to fully realize the magnitude to which 
their first pioneer efforts would grow with advancing years. Fromarelatively 
humble beginning, the school has enlarged its scope of usefulness so much 
that it has ceased to wield its influence merely locally, but includes in its 
educational reach many communities outside its first State confines. The 
demand for a school to supplement the academic equipment of Tennessee’s 
colored children before their entrance into varied fields of work has become 
so strong that work of an advanced nature, leading to college, is imperative; 
the work below the first year high school is being dropped to give place to this - 
higher type. The local communities of the State are much better able - 
to take care of the elementary education of their children than formerly. To 
teach legally in our first-class high schools, Smith-Hughes Agriculture and 
Home Ecenomics Department, and receive Federal Government funds, we 
must add college work. : 
The physical appearance and equipment of the school have far surpassed 
the fondest dream of the State Board of Education. From a rocky, uneven 
campus, beautiful lawns, trees and undulating ground have sprung up, as 
it were, by magic. From three rather scantily equipped buildings, nine 
modern structures grace the campus. From a rooming capacity of a little 
over a hundred, dormitories to accommodate six hundred have been patiently 
prayed and worked into existence. 
The following improvements to the physical plant have been made in the 
last year of 1921-22: well-equipped greenhouse, poultry colony houses, 
laundry, improved heating system, large gymnasium, women’s industrial 
building to house a dining room seating eight hundred people, teachers’ 
dining room, kitchen, model household economics rooms for class and demon- 
stration work, guest rooms, etc., new dormitories,-increasing the boarding ~ 
department capacity several hundred. : 
To meet the ever-increasing demand for more thorough training, the 
faculty has been greatly augmented since the opening of the school in the 
summer of 1912. Wherein that year there were only ten or twelve, now the 
list has grown to forty-five, graduates of the best schools of the country, with 
excellent training and teaching experiences. 
The increase in the school’s prestige as indicated above has reflected itself 
in the type of student who comes to the school and who leaves at the end of 
He fourre of training. The trend of development is conspicuous all along 
the line. 
The school has enrolled during its existence over 11,000 students from nearly every county in the State. Its graduates from its twenty depart- 
__ mnets number over 1,400. The thousands who have been touched through
-P-A-G-E-354
  —354— 
these students justify the statement that the educational influence of the 
school can hardly be estimated. 
The following lines of work are taught at this institution: Secondary, Nor- 
mal, College, Vocational and Teacher Training, Agriculture, Auto Mechanics, 
Blacksmithing, Brickmasonry, Broom-making, Carpentry, Commercial, 
Domestic Science, Dress-making, Handicraft, Laundrying, Manual Train- 
ing, Manual Art, Millinery, Painting, Printing, Plain Sewing, Shoemaking, 
Tailoring, Smith-Hughes Agriculture and Home Economics. 
Of the ninety-five counties of the State eighty-one have been represented 
in the registration of students. In the other fourteen there are practically 
no Negroes. 
The funds for maintaining the school are drawn mainly from the State.

Dormirorres. The State Normal School has been experiencing a very 
intensive building program during the past year. The building of wings to 
each of the dormitories has provided ample space for the accommodation of 
several hundred additional students. The rooms in these dormitories have 
been provided with every modern convenience so that students may learn 
lessons of neatness and economy in house furnishing. Each dormitory con- 
tains three commodious reception rooms together with tub and shower 
baths, fire escapes and cooling system for furnishing cold water for drinking 
purposes. The basement of each dormitory is furnished with laundry pe 
ment for the convenience of its occupants.

AGRICULTURE. A spacious greenhouse has been built to make the in- — 
struction of Agriculture and Landscape and Truck Gardening more thorough. 
This building is located conveniently so that classes in Biology and other 
sciences may have access to it. The tractor has been doing much of the work 
on the farm, giving the students an opportunity to learn lessons in farm ma~- 
chinery management. The Poultry Division has been augmented by the 
addition of several colony houses and incubators. Only high-class poultry — 
is being raised under the direction of an expert. The Dairy Department has 
been especially fortunate in having added to its equipment a power churn — 
and ice cream freezer, together with a fine herd of full-blooded stack. Milk 
and butter constitute a very important article of diet for the boarding de- 
partment. 
Gymnasium. The new gymnasium recently completed, affords ample 
space for general class work as well as for athletic contests, so much appreci- 
atedbythestudent body. Specialclasses have been organized for prospective 
athletic directors in play-ground supervision. 
Printinc. The Printing Department has installed two first-class lino- 
type machines. This will not only furnish valuable material for the instruc- 
tion of our students, but it will enable the school to do more and better 
printing. 
Mecnantcat Department. The-shop industries have been increased 
through the installation of a complete line of shoe-making equipment. The 
institution is well-equipped for making and repairing shoes for the school and 
community. 
The Auto Division has sufficient space for instruction purposes and stor- 
age of the large number of school cars, together with those owned by indi- 
viduals. The instruction in this Division includes all phases of work per- 
taining to auto repairing, driving and shop management. ‘This is one of the — 
most popular of the several industries for young men. svat 
Home Economics. Undoubtedly the most striking addition to the school 
campus is the large Home Economics building. It contains theory and prac- 
tice rooms for all the women’s industries, including the Commerical Depart- 
ment activities. The basement floor is being equipped for cooking and stor- 
age purposes. The first floor proper contains the dining hall, with seating 
capacity of six hundred. On the second floor, in addition to the classrooms, 
are guest chambers and the teachers’ dining room. The exterior of this 
building is very beautiful, and gives the campus the appearance of a growing 
university, which we are hoping will soon be realized in fact. 
ENGINEERING. The heating plant of the school has been overhauled and 
a large amount of new equipment installed, so that more heat and hot water 
may be available at a comparatively low cost. The installation and manage- 
ment of this heating plant affords great opportunity for students in the plumb- 
ing, electrical and mechanical engineering trades. 
SUMMARY 
The State Legislature approved, in 1921, bonds for A. & I. State Normal 
School for a building fund of $75,000. With this and other funds secured by 
the State Board of Education, the following buildings have been erected: 
1. SHops. Auto mechanics, gymnasium, shoe-making, printing, steam 
engineering and plumbing, a large building 75x150 ft., and two stories high, 
_ at an approximate cost of $50,000. 
   
-P-A-G-E-358
    —358— 
  2. Dormirorirs. We have been able to make the old dormitories three 
stories high, with four additional wings and 125 additional rooms, more than 
doubling the previous capacity, at a cost of $110,000. The dormitories will 
accommodate more than 500 students. 
3. NEw Dinrnc Hatt anp Homr Economics Buitpinc. A new dining 
hall and Home Economics building, 88x108 ft. in dimensions, two stories and. 
a basement, at a cost of $45,000. The dining hall will accommodate 800 people. 
The Home Economics building includes quarters for handicraft, plain sewing, 
dressmaking, designing, nurse training, laundering, canning, cooking, type- 
writing, bookkeeping and stenography. 
4. AppiTions. A new heating system, two new boilers, 125 horse power, 
concrete walks, greenhouse and a new dairy herd. More than $200,000 
invested in permanent buildings in the past two years. 
NEEDS 
Some of the needs of the A. & I. State Normal School are briefly as fol- 
lows: 
AGRICULTURE AND SCIENCE Buitpinc. The Agricultural Department is 
playing such an important role in the life of the school that a separate build- 
ing for technical instruction is badly needed. Such a building would be used 
for all the Animal Husbandry Industries, and serve as a clearing house for 
the various activities in this branch of work. The call for experts both as 
teachers and demonstration agents is so urgent and the supply so limited, due 
to lack of properly trained people, that we feel an investment in such a build- 
ing would be in keeping with the idea of efficiency in agricultural education, 
as expressed by the State Department of Agriculture. 
The school has a need for a four-year college course, and this will neces- 
sitate equipment for much more science teaching than has been true hereto- 
fore. A special building for this subject will give the school much better 
opportunity for theory and applied work in the various branches of science 
which are taught. The Science building could be used by all departments 
in the institution as a laboratory. 
Lisrary. The need of a Library building is equally urgent. The work 
of the upper classes is becoming so extensive that a convenient place for re- 
search work for both teachers and students is an absolute necessity. At 
present the Library is occupying one of the class-rooms, which is badly needed 
for the purpose for which it was built. 
Tracuers’ Home. A home for teachers would be a great asset to the in- 
stitution, inasmuch as the faculty is becoming larger, and an increasing 
number of married teachers, as well as a large number of single teachers who 
would eventually settle on the school campus, would welcome such home life _ 
were a place provided for light housekeeping. A place such as we have in 
mind would more than pay for itself in the comfort and convenience which 
it will afford the teachers of the school. 
We sincerely thank the State Legislature and the State Board of Educa- 
tion for their loyal support of our State Institution, morally and financially. 
Whatever we have been able to accomplish has been done largely through their _ 
generous acts. We ask only for greater opportunities in the form of buildings 
and equipment that we may serve more largely and effectively the citizens _ 
of our great State. ; ;      
    Gratefully yours, 
W. J. Hate, President.

  TENNESSEE SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND 
Honorasre J. B. Brown, Superintendent of Public Instruction, Nashville, 
Tennessee. 
In compliance with your request, I take pleasure in handing you herewith 8 
a brief report of the Tennessee School for the Blind, covering the period July © 
1, 1920 to July 1, 1922. 
The Tennessee School for the Blind, begun in a small way in 1844, has 
been expanding and growing in usefulness from year to year until today it is — 
one of the largest State institutions of its kind in the country, and offers oppor- 
children of school age, from the State of Tennessee, giving them board, tui- 
tion, laundry, medical attention, use of books and other equipment, free of 
charge, the only expense of the children being railroad fare to and from the 
school and incidental expenses, the pupils furnishing their own clothing. ; 
The school, under the same management, conducts both a white and a 
colored department. The white department is located in Nashville, Ten- 
nessee, on a ten-acre campus, one mile southeast of the heart of the city, on 
an elevation overlooking Cumberland River and facing Hermitage Avenue, 
on the south, six hundred and fifty feet. It is one block from the Medical 
Departmen: of Vanderbilt University, and is within easy reach of churches 
of various denominations. 
The colored department is located at No. 338 Shepherd St., one mile from 
the white department, on an elevation that gives it a commanding view of 
South Nashville. 
During the last biennium the buildings at the white department have been 
repainted, improvements and additions have been made, and the grounds 
have been beautified. 
Through the special appropriation of $25,000.00 made by the last Legis- 
lature, the facilities of the colored department have been improved and en- 
larged, until it is now capable of accommodating sixty or seventy-five chil- 
dren. ® 
Both departments of the school, barring a few needed repairs and improve- 
ments contemplated, are in splendid condition, and the Tennessee School for — g 
the Blind, in both departments, is well equipped and ample to take care of 
the blind and partially sighted children of the State of Tennessee. 
The school offers advantages to its pupils in literary subjects corresponding 
to courses given in the public schools of the State, throughout the primary, 
intermediate, and high school grades, the only difference being that pupils 
of the Tennessee School for the Blind use their fingers in deciphering embossed 
texts, while the seeing schools use ink print texts. The blind and partially 
sighted use specially designed slates for writing the Braille and for calculations. 
With the handicapped there is always great need for special and definite 
training as preparation for a more narrowly prescribed field of opportunities, 
the purpose being to fit,as far as possible, each child to fill a place in lifé. 
This school must, therefore, offer a greater diversity of opportunities and 
advantages to its pupils while in school than are offered to sighted children in 
other schools. If, for instance, a pupil has musical talent and promises well 
___ in the field of music, he should be trained accordingly, in addition to his gen-

eral literary work, and the manifestation of any peculiar aptitude or bent of 
mind that would lead to success in after life must be sought after and provided 
for. Only by following such a plan can the school adequately perform its 
duties and function. Hence, the wide range of opportunities and courses, as 
well as an attempt to work out a system of prescribed and elective studies, 
leading to graduation. 
The following departments are maintained: 
(a) Literary, primary, intermediate and high school. 
(b) Music: (1) instrumental, including piano, violin, pipe organ, reed or- 
gan and band instruments; (2) vocal, including public school music in the 
grades, choral singing, glee club work, and private voice. 
(c) Industrial and vocational: shop-work for boys, including broom-, 
mop- and mattress-making, chair caning, etc.; handcraft for girls, including _ 
sewing, knitting, fancy work, weaving, etc.; boys are also instructed in tuning 
and repairing, and the girls are taught cooking; both girls and boys are given 
instruction in typewriting and poultry raising. 
(d) Physical training: the school has a splendidly equipped gymnasium, 
and every boy and girl must spend at least one period a day in physical train- 
ing. 
UNITS AND CREDITS 
It is believed to be desirable from many standpoints and but fair to give 
due credit to all studies and activities required, assigned or permitted. The 
plan makes room for the encouragement of special talent. It gives impor- 
tance to, and dignifies, all school duties, and insures a higher standard of 
effort and efficiency in every line. 
- Pupils must meet credit requirements to gain credit and not merely meet 
_ assignments in a perfunctory manner.

  _TENNESSEE SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF AND DUMB 
To the Honorable J. B. Brown, State Superintendent of Public Las es . 
Nashville, Tennessee. 
SiR 
In compliance to your request, I herewith submit a brief report of the 
Tennessee School for the Deaf and Dumb, covering the biennial period from 
July 1, 1920 to July 1, 1922. z 
The course of study covers the main branches of the elementary work as 
offered in the public schools. Beginning with the session of 1922, higher work 
will be added each year until a well rounded high school curriculum is estab- 
lished. 
Our method of instruction is what is generally known as the ‘(Combined 
System.” This system is defined in the American Annals of the Deaf as 
follows: “Speech and speech-reading are regarded as very important, but 
mental development and the acquisition of language are regarded as still 
more important. It is believed that in some cases mental development and 
the acquisition of language can be best promoted by the Manual or the Man- 
ual Alphabet method, and, so far as circumstances permit, such method is 
chosen for each pupil as seems best adapted for his individual case. Speech 
and speech-reading are taught where the measure of success seems likely to 
justify the labor expended, and in some of the class rooms of most of the 
oo Schools the Oral or the Auricular method is strictly fol- 
owed.” 
In the academic department twenty-one teachers are employed. This 
number includes the supervising teacher with ten regular teachers in the 
oral department and nine teachers in the manual department. Printing, 
shoe-making, barbering and carpentry are offered as trades for the boys: 
sewing, dressmaking, cooking and housekeeping for the girls. Five part- 
time teachers are employed in the industrial department. 
In a school where all children are resident pupils, great opportunity is 
offered for guiding their general habits, not in any sense institutionalizing 
them,—we continually guard against that—but with the idea of keeping a — 
home-like atmosphere, their conduct is under guidance and ample oppor- — 
tunity given for moral, social and religious training. We have regularly con- 
ducted Sunday school’ classes, chapel lectures, a literary society, supervised 
social gatherings each month, athletic contests among ourselves, and in — 
competition with school for the hearing. We operate our own moving pic- 
ture machine and accept pictures of only the highest type. The school has 
a military organization among the older boys, also a band. | The latter gives 
us the distinction of being the only southern school for the deaf with Bee an 
: organization.

STATE OF TENNESSEE 
DEPARTMENT oF PuBLic INSTRUCTION 
NASHVILLE 
In submitting this annual statistical report, I beg to call your attention 
to the discussion of recent school legislation, and certain statistical inter- 
pretations. 
Charts have been used in order that certain significant facts might the 
more easily be read and interpreted by those interested in public school 
affairs of the State. These charts reveal some conditions that may be as- 
tounding. However, if the schools are to be improved the public must first 
be advised of the conditions and the causes producing them, that remedies 
may be prescribed and applied. 
A broad comprehensive program of education is necessary if all classes 
and interests of the State are to be served. But it should be remembered 
that a proper balance must be maintained in the support of every school 
from the remote rural school through the high school. 
The rural school situation challenges the thoughtful interest and the 
unselfish efforts of every school official, teacher and citizen in Tennessee. 
Since seventy-two percent of the total enrollment in the public schools is in 
the rural elementary schools, this phase of our educational system presents 
the most important problem and the most difficult of solution. 
The maximum efficiency cannot be reached until the people realize that 
the public schools belong to them, and that progress in public education de- 
pends upon whole-hearted public support. 
A careful study of the charts and tables included in this report is invited, 
in the hope that all citizens may join heartily in a definite, constructive, pro- 
gressive program to the end that adequate educational opportunities may be 
provided for every child in the State. 
Very truly yours, 
J. B. Brown, 
Superintendent.

SCHOOL LEGISLATION PASSED BY THEEGENERAL ASSEMBLY 
OF 1921 
Tennessee’s code of school laws as a whole is recognized by national 
educational leaders as being one of the best codes in the nation. But laws 
alone do not guarantee efficient schools. They provide the machinery, the 
ways and means of administering the school system in which the children of 
the State may be educated. These laws must be honestly interpreted and 
observed in all good faith. . 
County Boarp or Epucation Law 
The Tennessee General Assembly, at its 1921 session, reflected the best 
educational thought of the nation respecting the method of county school 
administration when it passed the new County Board of Education Law. 
Under the provisions of this law a county board of education consisting of 
seven members elected for a term of seven years, one member retiring each 
succeeding year, was created. This long tenure of office guarantees a con- 
tinuity of educational policy in the county school administration. 
Under the old dual system, in which two boards of education adminis- 
tered the school affairs of the county, the county high school board limited 
its efforts to the establishment and maintenance of high schools. On the 
other hand, the county board having charge of the elementary schools was 
satisfied when its demands for the elementary schools had been met. There 
was no co-ordination of effort on the part of the two boards. Frequently 
there was overlapping of authority and duplication of effort resulting in 
confusion and disagreements. 
Gratifying results have been secured in the management and operation 
of the high schools. The standard fixed for this group of schools should be 
maintained. But the elementary schools that have suffered so much for 
lack of proper standards must be improved. 
Reference to Charts 6 and 7 indicates a most serious situation in the dis- 
tribution of pupils in the grades from the first grade of the elementary school to 
the last year of the high school. Ninety-five percent of the total enrollment 
in the county school system is found in the elementary schools. It is sin- 
cerely hoped that a county board of education responsible for the adminis- 
tration of both elementary and high schools will be more thoughtful of the 
children enrolled in these grades. 
County SUPERINTENDENT LAW 
Another forwara step was taken by the General Assembly at its 1921 
session in the enactment of a law extending the term of office of the county 
superintendent to four years, effective January Ist, 1923, instead of two 
years, as at present. A longer tenure of office of the county superintendent 
will attract the best talent in the profession to this responsible position. 
Further, it will give the county superintendent opportunity to project an 
educational policy with the assurance that he will have more time than for- 
merly in which to demonstrate its merit. 
The minimum qualification of an applicant for the office of county su- 
perintendent is fixed by this law at two years of college or normal training, 
plus at least twenty-four months of teaching experience. 
 
-P-A-G-E-388
In order to secure the maximum efficiency in the administration of the 
office of county superintendent, the Legislature fixed the minimum State 
supplement to the salary of county superintendents at $500 and the maxi- 
mum at $1,000, the county to provide an equal amount. The State supple- 
ment will be paid on condition that the county superintendent devotes his 
entire time to the duties of the office of county superintendent. 
Scuoot Bupcet Law 
Through the application of the school budget law strict methods in the 
business administration of the county school system are guaranteed. Under 
a penalty of dismissal from office, the county board of education is forbidden 
to exceed the legitimate income for any school year The school funds must 
be spent in keeping with the budget submitted by the county board of edu- 
cation and approved by the County Court. 
TEACHER-TRAINING IN HiGH SCHOOLS 
It is highly desirable that every teacher in the elementary public schools 
possess good scholarship, with special training in school management and 
class-room methods. But we have not yet attained this standard and pos- 
sibly shall not for many years. The responsibility for the shortage of trained 
teachers cannot properly be charged against the State teacher-training in- 
stitutions, the State Normal Schools. The fault lies in the fact that we have 
minimized and belittled rather than magnified and dignified the profession of 
teaching. The normal schools have rendered an indispensable service to 
the public school interests of the State in training teachers for the public 
schools and in setting up and holding up educational standards. Li,ewise, 
the University of Tennessee and the private and church-aided colleges have 
been a great source of strength to the public schools in furnishing teachers 
from among their graduates. But all of these sources of supply will not 
meet the annual demand for new teachers to fill vacancies caused by resigna- 
tions in the city and town schools and in the high and elementary schools of 
the counties. In fact, the total number of graduates from all of these schools 
have not, in previous years, supplied more than one-third of the total number 
of new teachers needed each year. 
To meet the shortage of trained teachers in the rural elementary schools, 
especially of the financially poor counties, the Legislature at its 1921 session 
provided a special fund to be used to encourage the establishment of teacher- 
training departments in county high schools. These departments will be 
established in about forty county high schools the coming year. Special 
teacher-training courses have been outlined for the third and fourth years of 
the high schools. Graduates of county high schools taking these courses 
will be granted a certificate good for one year in the rural elementary schools 
in the county in,which they graduate. 
It is further recommended that county boards of education require their 
teachers who have had less than a high school education to enroll in the 
teacher-training schools in their respective county high schools or in some 
teacher training institution at the close of the present school term. By the 
application and enforcement of this regulation, it is the belief that in a few 
years high school graduation with special training can be made the minimum 
qualification of all new teachers.
-P-A-G-E-389
State ScHooL Funps 
The method of apportioning a part of the State school funds to counties 
will, after July 1st, 1922, be on the basis of average daily attendance instead 
of on the basis of scholastic population. This has been found to be one of 
the fairest methods of apportioning the State funds. The State is interested 
in the children who are in the schools, and this fund should go to equalize 
the expense of education in proportion to the number of children being taught 
in any county. 
This basis of distribution will stimulate school officials, teachers, patrons 
and taxpayers to a greater effort in the enforcement of the compulsory school 
law, a law that has been on the statute book since 1913, but which has never 
been consistently and persistently enforced. 
The high school apportionment, after July Ist, 1922, will be on the basis 
of, first, $1,000 to all counties; second, the remainder on the average daily 
attendance in the high schools. : 
— — oe 
STATE EQUALIZATION FUND 
In order to aid the financially poor counties a subsidy of $6,000 is offered 
each county that levies a county elementary school tax sufficient to produce 
$5.00 per child of school age, but if a minimum county elementary school tax 
of thirty cents on the $100 assessed valuation of property does not produce 
as much as $5.00 per child of school age, said county shall receive the $6,000 
without further increase in its levy. The effect of this provision of law will 
be to stimulate local initiative. 
THe TuReE-CENT ELEMENTARY Tax 
In addition to the funds above mentioned, the State Legislature at its 
1921 session levied a three-cent elementary school tax on the $100 assessed 
valuation of property of the entire State, the proceeds from which are to be 
distributed, first, $2,000 annually to all counties; second, the remainder on 
the basis of the average daily attendance in the elementary schools. 
With the increased State and county funds, we should have longer school 
terms. With the added efforts of the high schools, normal schools, the State 
university, and private colleges in training teachers, we should expect a more 
efficient school system. .

COUNTY AND CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS OF TENNESSEE FOR THE 
YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1921 
CONTENTS—Value of School Property; Annual Cost Per Pupil; Grade 
Enrollment; Census, Enrollment and Average Daily Attendance; Edu- 
cational Qualifications of Teachers. 
The statistics found in this State Report are derived entirely from the 
reports of the County Superintendents. These statistics do not consider 
private schools of the State; but include only elementary and high schools 
of both the county and city systems. The financial receipts and expendi- 
tures for the county elementary and county high schools are separated. As 
many cities in the State do not separate the city elementary and city high 
school receipts and expenditures, these two have been combined. 
The following charts are based on the reports of the County Superin- 
tendents for the year ending June 30, 1921. 
CHART ONE—TaxasLe Werattu For Eacu CurILtp oF ScHooL AGE IN 
THE STATE. 
Chart One ranks the counties of the State according to the taxable 
wealth back of each child of school age. This chart was obtained by divi- 
ding the assessed valuation of each county in the State, as fixed by the State 
Board of Equalization for the year 1920 by its school census of July, 1920. 
An inspection of this chart reveals that forty-seven counties have a taxable 
wealth per pupil of less than $1,672.00. It is impossible for these counties 
to have long school terms, adequate salaries for teachers and proper housing 
facilities for pupils, unless very high tax rates are levied. Counties with 
two thousand or more dollars for each person of school age are enabled by a 
comparatively low tax rates to maintain the school term for eight or nine 
months. 
Shelby, with a taxable wealth of $4,983.00 for each child of school age, 
has more than seven times the resources with which to educate its children 
as Pickett, which has only $682.00 of taxable wealth for each child. Shelby 
is also three times as wealthy per,child as Van Buren, the median county of 
the State. In other words, Pickett must levy a tax rate seven times as great 
as that levied by Shelby in order to have the same amount per child. Half of 
the counties must levy tax rates more than three times as high as Shelby’s in 
order to make available the same amount of money per child. 
A study of Tables Twenty-Five and Twenty-Six show that many of the 
poorer counties are levying very high tax rates, and are yet unable to have 
long school terms or to pay their teachers good salaries. On the other hand, 
many of the wealthier counties have very low tax rates, and are yet able to 
keep their children in school for nine months and pay their teachers good 
salaries. 
It will be impossible for all children of the State to receive anything like 
the same educational opportunities unless the State more adequately provides 
for the poorer counties.

CHART TWO—Vatve or ScHoot Property PER Cuitp ENROLLED. 
Chart Two shows the value of the school property for each child en- 
rolled. The total value of the school property in the State of Tennessee 
for the year ending June 30, 1921, as reported by Superintendents, is $26 ,500,- 
022.00. This includes the value of buildings, sites, and equipment. The 
value of elementary and of high school property is not separated in this 
report. Such a separation is desirable and should be made by the County 
and City Superintendents in their next reports. It is very probable that 
this table is not as accurate as it should be, as no definite standards have 
heretofore been issued by the State Department of Education for the valua- 
tion of school property. There is no uniformity in the methods used by the 
County Superintendents in arriving at their property valuations, and it is 
very probable that a uniform system would materially change the valuation 
as given in Table Twenty-Four and shown in Chart Two. It is very prob- 
able that in many instances the total value of the school property has been 
overestimated. ' : 
A great variation exists among the different counties. Hamilton County 
ranks first with $106.00 invested in property for each child enrolled. At 
the other extreme is Fentress County, with $8.00 per pupil enrolled. The 
average for the whole State is $44.00. However, only twenty-one counties 
have a valuation greater than this average. 
The United States valuation of 1918 was $95.00 per child, and it is very 
probable that the valuation for the year ending June 30, 1921, is considerably 
more than $100.00. Only one county in the State of Tennessee has a valu- 
ation greater than the United States average of 1918, It will be seen that 
Hamilton County has over thirteen times as much money invested in school 
property per child enrolled as Fentress County.

CHARTS THREE, FOUR AND FIVE—Annvat Cost PER Pupit ENROLLED. 
In Charts Three, Four and Five the annual cost per pupil was com- 
puted by adding together the total amounts spent for administration and 
supervision, and operating expenses, and dividing this sum by the total 
number of pupils enrolled. It was thought best to exclude expenditures in- 
curred in permanent improvements, as one county might rank very high in 
permanent improvements one year and very low the next. Such an omission 
avoids these extremes. 
Chart Three, which shows the annual cost per pupil enrolled in all 
schools, county and city, elementary and high, indicates that there were 
only three counties, Hamilton, Shelby and Knox, spending more money than 
the 1918 U. S. average of $30.91 per pupil enrolled. The United States aver- 
age is now higher than in 1918. Only sixteen counties of the State are above 
the Tennessee average, $18.18 per child. Hamilton County is first with an 
expenditure of $44.60, and Stewart at the foot with $5.51. Hamilton County 
spent over eight times as much per child as Stewart County, and more than 
three times as much per child as was spent by the median county, Marshall. 
Chart Four shows the annual cost per pupil in city schools. This in- 
cludes, as explained above, both elementary and high schools. Hamilton 
County, with an expenditure of $63.95 per child enrolled, is again in the lead. 
Johnson County is at the bottom, with an expenditure of $4.13. Smith, the 
median county, with an expenditure of $18.54, is above the Tennessee av- 
erage of $18.18. In other words, half of the city systems are spending more 
than the Tennessee average of $18.18. 
Chart Five shows the annual cost per pupil in the rural elementary 
schools. This is the most important division of our State school system, as 
72.3 percent of the total State school enrollment is found in the rural ele- 
mentary schools. It is the most neglected division of our State school sys- 
tem, as the average amount spent on each child in the rural elementary 
schools is only $12.03. The state average for elementary and high schools 
combined is $18.18, while the city average (elementary and high combined) 
is $29.31, and the average spent per pupil in the county high schools is 
$71.67. The average spent per pupil in the United States (elementary and 
high) in. 1918 was $30.91, and is now considerably higher. Not a single 
county in the State of Tennessee is now spending as much per rural elemen- 
tary pupil as the general United States average of three years ago. Only 
oné county, Hamilton, with an expenditure of $30.80 per child, is above the 
city average of $29.31; while but seven counties, Hamilton, Davidson, Lake, 
Bradley, Smith, Shelby and Polk, are spending more for the rural elementary 
child than the general state average of $18.18. 
Such a small expenditure for the rural elementary schools explains in a 
large measure the great retardation and elimination of pupils now taking 
place in the rural schools. Chart Five, in a great measure, explains the con- 
ditions presented in Chart Seven. The short rural school terms are 
results of the poor financial.support given the county elementary schools. If 
Tennessee is to raise her educational rank among states, the rural elementary 
situation must receive more consideration from the tax payers than it now 
receives. Seventy-two out of every one hundred future citizens now in school 
are found in the rural elementary schools. They are entitled to the same 
educational opportunities as are given the twenty-eight children enrolled i in 
city elementary and county and cith high schools.

CHART SIX AND SEVEN—Grabe .ENROLLMENT. 
Chart Six shows the grade enrollment for all the public schools of the 
State, city and county combined, and the percentage of boys and girls in 
each grade. The most striking fact seen in this chart is the very large number 
enrolled in the first grade. The large number enrolled in the first grade may 
be-partially accounted for by the fact that there are many repeaters. The 
worst breaks in the system are between the first and second grades 
and between the eighth grade and the first year high schools. There is also 
a decided break between the first and second years of high school.. Another 
noticeable feature of this chart is the ratio of enrollment between the boys 
and girls. 52.2 per cent of those enrolled in the first grade are boys. The 
percentage of boys gradually decreases until the third year high school is 
reached; here we find only 39.8 percent of the pupils are boys. More boys than 
girls in the third year continue in school throughout the fourth year for in the 
fourth year the percentage of boys rises to 41.8 percent. 
The two bars at the bottom of the page show the grade enrollment by 
percentages of the county and city systems respectively. These bars show 
the very large percentages of pupils in the lower grades, and the corres- 
pondingly low percentages in the upper grades. 
In seventeen states having the eight-four plan (eight years elementary 
and four years high), 1918 statistics show that an average of 19.2 percent of 
the total school enrollment were enrolled in the first grade. Some of the 
better city systems do not have more than 12 percent of the school enroll- 
ment in the first grade. In our county system 29.63 percent of all the pupils 
are enrolled in the first grade, while in our city schools only 21.32 percent are 
in the first grade. In our county schools only 4.57.percent of the total en- 
rollment is found in the high school, whereas in the city system 10.8 percent 
of the entire enrollment enters high school. A student who has the advan- 
tages of the city system has more than twice as good a chance of reaching 
high school as a student in the rural schools. The United States Statistical 
Report for 1918 ranks the various states according to the percentages of their 
total school enrollment found in high schools. California was the highest 
with nineteen percent of her total enrollment in high schools, and South 
Carolina was at the other extreme with only 2.2 percent of her enrollment 
in high schools. The average of the United States was 9.3 percent. All 
these averages are probably higher now. The proportion of the entire Ten- 
nessee State enrollment found in high schools is 6.08. It will be seen that 
in this respect Tennessee takes a low rank among the states, and that our 
county schools are especially faulty. 
The short rural elementary school terms and the poor articulation be- 
tween the elementary and high schools of the county system are largely 
responsible for this small enrollment in the county high schools. As long as 
the rural elementary schools are run five, six and even seven months in the 
year it will be impossible for them to prepare many students for the high 
schools. 
Chart Seven shows the grade distribution, county and city, elementary 
and high, in another manner. The heavy curve shows the grade enrollment
-P-A-G-E-407
e259 
of all the schools of the State, the broken curve indicates the distribution of 
county pupils, and the dotted curve shows the grade enrollment of city pupils. 
It will be seen that in the city curve the fall in enrollment is much more grad- 
ual and not so irregular as in the county curve, where the grade enrollment 
decreases with great rapidity and irregularity. This indicates that the city 
schools are on the whole more successful in promoting their pupils from grade 
to grade than the county schools.

CHART EIGHT—Scnoot Census, ENROLLMENT AND AVERAGE DaILy 
ATTENDANCE. 
The two bars at the top of the page compare the school population and 
enrollment in the county and in the city schools. 74.4 percent of our school 
population lives outside the cities. 75.7 percent of our school enrollment 
attends county schools. These bars show that a somewhat larger percent 
of the county school population enrolls in school than does the city population. 
This may be partly accounted for when we remember that county school 
terms are shorter and that on the whole county children attend school until 
they are much older than city school children. 
The third bar compares the average daily attendance in county and city 
elementary schools. This is especially interesting, as a large part of the 
State elementary school funds, and all the county elementary school funds 
beginning July 1, 1922, will be distributed between the county and city 
systems on the basis of the average daily attendance. For the past school 
year the county systems actually obtained 74.4 percent of all State and county 
school funds that were distributed on the basis of the school census; whereas, 
if these same funds had been distributed under the new law, which apportions 
according to the average daily attendance, the county schools would have 
obtained 75.7 percent. 
The children at the bottom of the page show for the entire State, the 
percentage of the school population enrolled in school; the percentage of the 
school enrollment in daily attendance; and the percentage of the school popu- 
lation in daily attendance.

CHART NINE—Epvcationat QuaLiricaTIONS OF TEACHERS 
At the top of the chart is displayed the educational qualifications of every 
one hundred teachers who teach in one room, two room, and three or more 
room schools respectively. Thus we see of every hundred teachers found in 
one room schools forty-one have elementary education only, thirty-three 
have had partial high school education, eighteen are high school graduates, 
three have had academic normal training, two are normal graduates, two 
have had partial college training, and one is a college graduate. 
Of every one hundred teachers in two room schools seventeen have ele- 
mentary training, thirty have partial high school education, thirty-four are 
high school graduates, seven are academic normal graduates, four are normal 
graduates, six have partial college training, and two are college graduates. 
To mention the two extremes of education found in the three room and up 
schools, five only of every hundred teachers have elementary education, 
while fourteen are normal graduates and sixteen are college graduates. 
It will be seen that the teachers with college and normal school educa- 
tions are found largely in schools of three rooms and up, while very few are 
found in two room schools, and even fewer are in the one room schools. 
In the seven bars-in the center of the Chart, each bar represents one 
hundred teachers with education as indicated below the bar. The black sec- 
tions indicate teachers in one room schools, the cross lined sections indicate 
teachers in two room schools, while the diagonally lined sections indicate 
teachers in three room schools. 
It will be seen that in the first two bars the black predominates, showing 
that those teachers having only elementary or partial high school education 
find their way largely to the one room schools. Of every one hundred teach- 
ers with elementary education seventy-three are teaching in one room schools. 
As we go on to the bars representing groups of teachers who have had better 
educational advantages, we find fewer and fewer of them teaching in one 
room schools, until out of every one hundred teachers who graduate from 
colleges or normals, only eight teach in one room schools. This is to be 
expected as long as teachers of one room schools are generally paid the lowest 
salaries. It is a natural result that teachers with higher educational qualifi- 
cations go to schools which offer better remuneration. 
Nearly one-fifth of every hundred teachers having elementary educations 
are found in two room schools, and the percent increases with those having 
partial high school education and a further increase is noted in the high 
school graduates, approximately one-third of all high school graduates teach- 
ing in the two room schools. A decrease is noted as the academic normal 
graduates are reached, and successive smaller percentages are found in those 
bars representing higher and higher qualifications of teachers. Teachers 
who are high school graduates predominate, thirty-two of every one hundred 
teachers who are high school graduates teach in two room schools. The two 
room schools also get a large share of the teachers with partial high school, 
academic normal and partial college educations. Fourteen normal graduates 
out of every hundred and seven college graduates teach in two room schools. 
It will be seen that the schools with three rooms and up are supplied with 
teachers having far superior educational qualifications. This is natural, for 
not only are the salaries better in larger schools, but the schools are situated 
generally in larger communities where superior social advantages and modern 
conveniences are to be enjoyed. Of every hundred teachers with elementary
-P-A-G-E-414
ee 
educations only, eight are found in three room schools. As the educational 
qualifications}become higher, we find the number of teachers from each group 
entering the three room schools becoming larger. We find that seventy- 
eight of each one hundred teachers who are normal school graduates and 
eighty-five of every one hundred who are college graduates are teaching in 
schools having three or more rooms. 
Now considering the bar at the bottom of the page, we find that out of 
every one hundred rural elementary pupils forty-seven attend school in one 
room schools, twenty-five are found in two room schools, and twenty-eight 
are in schools of three or more rooms. 
As nearly three-fourths of all rural and two elementary pupils are found 
in one room schools, a strong effort should be made to raise the educational 
qualifications of teachers in this much neglected type of school.

i : November 30th, 1921. 
STATE BOARD FOR VOCATIONAL EDUCATION, 
Nashville, Tenn. 
GENTLEMEN: 
I take pleasure in submitting a brief summary of the classes in tho 
trades and industries receiving Federal and State aid from Smith-Hughes 
funds. 
During the past year the emphasis has been placed almost entirely upon 
the part-time and evening classes for employed people. Unsettled employed 
conditions have made necessary many changes in plans. 
Employers have given splendid cooperation in the organization of classes 
and in several cases have assisted the local school boards in a financial way. 
One of the greatest handicaps in vocational education is the lack of funds by 
the County and City Boards. 
The greatest need in Tennessee at present is the part-time general con- 
tinuation class for minors where employed children can be taught citizen- 
ship, hygiene and the three R’s. 
Under the Vocational Act the part-time pupil may be taught any sub- 
ject that will increase his civic or vocational intelligence. We are unfor- 
tunate in Tennessee in not having a compulsory part-time law compelling 
school boards to establish part-time classes for employed children who have 
not finished the 8th grade. This is one of the objectives which we must try 
to reach. 
The Trade and Industrial Teacher Training is under the direction of 
Mr. H. H. Coxen, professor of Industrial Education at the University of 
Tennessee. 
Respectfully submitted, 
July 7, 1921. Jas. ARENTSON. uly 7, 1921.

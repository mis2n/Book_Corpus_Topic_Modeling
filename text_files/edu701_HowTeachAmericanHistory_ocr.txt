PREFACE 
Tuis volume is intended for use as a textbook in 
normal schools, teacher-training classes, and teachers’ 
institutes, and as a handbook for the teacher and stu- 
dent in school or at home. The principles discussed 
are believed to be true of history in general, but the 
application throughout has been made to American 
history and to the study and teaching of history in 
American schools. 
An effort has been made to have the style simple 
and intelligible. Technical terms not well settled in 
common usage have been avoided. A rather close and 
logical classification by chapters has been attempted, 
and the book lists have been classified and distributed. 
It has been my aim throughout to give in the book lists 
and footnotes information of practical value and to 
place it where it can be found conveniently. It is 
hoped that the complete index appended will be found 
a useful feature. 
The methods herein suggested are an outgrowth of 
practice, and have been proved in the experience of 
capable teachers and students of history in many parts 
of the country. The portions of the book for which 
the author ventures to claim more or less originality, 
for example, Chapters IV, XIV, XVII, XIX, XX, 
XXIV, XXVI, XXVIII, XXX, are no exception to 
this rule; for they have all been evolved from actus 
vu

classroom experiment, most of them by what may 
properly be termed the laboratory process. 
Special emphasis has been placed upon the moral 
values of history in normal social relations. Conse- 
quently the principles acknowledged are those that are 
constructive rather than destructive. The heroes ex- 
tolled and the victories cheered are those of peace 
rather than those of war; and the “brave at home” 
are given due recognition. 
It is suggested that teachers may find it desirable to 
introduce the matter of Chapter XXVII near the be- 
ginning of a course of instruction. 
Special obligation is acknowledged to my friend, 
Miss Yetta S. Shoninger, B.S., of the George Peabody 
College for Teachers, Nashville, Tennessee, for valu- 
able suggestions regarding the treatment of certain 
topics, and to Miss Elizabeth P. Cleveland, A.B., one 
of my colleagues in the State Normal School, Harrison- 
burg, Virginia, for helpful criticisms regarding form 
and for aid in reading proof. 
For various appreciated favors grateful acknowl- 
edgment is made also to the following: Miss Beulah 
Wardell, M.A., Columbus, Ohio; Professor E. M. Vio- 
lette, First District Normal School, Kirksville, Mis- 
souri; Dr. Frank A. Magruder, Princeton University ;

  HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
CHAPTER I 
TWO PRELIMINARY QUESTIONS 
WE spend so much time and energy on the ‘“‘ What” 
and the ‘‘Where” and the ‘‘When” of history, as 
well as of other things, that we often forget or neglect 
the ““How” and the ‘‘Why.”’ All are important, 
and each must receive due attention in its place; 
but now let us consider briefly, in an introductory 
way, the ‘“‘How”’ and the “Why.” 
Why study history. — First, we should study it, let 
us say, for the pleasure of it. Most things that 
most people do, when they act upon choice, are 
done for this reason. It may not be the best reason, 
but it is compelling in its appeal and universal-in its 
scope. If the pleasure sought or found is clean and 
wholesome, then the reason is good. Normal pleas- 
ure, like springtime and youth, gives health to the 
body and growth to the spirit. The pleasure that 
comes with the study of history is like the pleasure 
of travel, which fills the eye with ever changing won- 
ders ; or like the fascination of the drama, which lifts

the far-flung curtain on a world stage, and presents 
before our eyes the Esthers, the Caesars, the Alfreds, 
the Shakespeares, and all the people, in habit and in 
action. 
Second, we should study history for the knowledge 
it supplies. Consciousness of intelligence and knowl- 
edge increases one’s proper confidence, and heightens 
one’s legitimate pleasures. Knowledge is the light 
of the soul, and only those souls that are born of 
the night can be satisfied in the narrow cells of igno- 
rance. The great decree, ‘‘Let there be light,” was 
spoken not to the world of material chaos alone, but 
to the world of potential consciousness as well. The 
desire to know is strong in every healthy mind, and 
this desire is justified by an eternal right. History 
is one of the great doors through which the soul 
goes out seeking and finding knowledge. 
Third, we should study history as an aid to the 
appreciation of other things. The young lady who 
said, ‘‘I like history because I am very fond of read- 
ing, and history helps me to understand and enjoy 
what I read,” gave a good reason. History enriches 
literature, it explains civil government, it justifies 
social institutions, it gives character to art, speech 
to architecture, and accompaniment to music. It 
teaches a thousand years of progress in a single 
arch or column, and unfolds the story of a race in 
the meaning of a word. It lifts the vision to a 
mountain-top, and there points down upon the mov-

ing ages. The family grows large in history; the 
church comes to adorn herself with humility and 
charity; the state proves the need of justice and 
equity ; and the school emerges as the fundamental 
rector of society. Geometry, physics, chemistry, and 
medicine are all well clad in the robe of history. 
The Roman law in Louisiana and the German law 
in England are anomalies until history uncovers the 
winding ways of the past. Shakespeare is only half 
understood and Milton speaks in an unknown tongue 
till Clio unfolds her wondrous parchment and _be- 
comes interpreter. Then strange words have mean- 
ing, and old words count double. Then the masters 
speak in our own familiar tongue, and we, delighted, 
listen. 
Fourth, we should study history as a means to a 
better understanding of ourselves. ‘‘ Know thyself” 
was inscribed over the main entrance to the temple 
at Delphi, and all the history of the world seems to 
be written as an aid to him who endeavors to obey. 
When the heathen said that that command came 
down from heaven, they spoke better than they 
knew. It is, indeed, divine. Being divine, it must 
be heeded ; and obedience is blessed. History teaches 
a man how small he is by showing him so many 
greater. It teaches him how great he may be by 
showing him what less favored men have done. It 
purges him of conceit by revealing his fancied origi- 
nality as a commonplace of centuries gone. It over-
-P-A-G-E-16
4 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
throws his dogmatism by proving to him that other 
men no less honest than he, and much wiser, have 
been mistaken in their judgments. It convinces 
him that he did not begin with himself, and that he 
cannot end with himself; that the most he has 
others have given him ; that the most he knows others 
have taught him ; and that all he can do he owes to 
others. History helps him to see himself as one 
among countless millions, yet it brings him to know 
himself as a man, in whom is potentially every 
power, feeling, thought, and achievement that any 
man has ever had, felt, known, or done. 
Fifth, we should study history to broaden and 
quicken our sympathies with others. As we learn 
to know ourselves we are brought into closer touch 
with our fellows, whether of this age or of other ages. 
As we begin to know ourselves as men and women, 
we begin to understand other men and women, whom 
we soon recognize as our kinsfolk. From the primi- 
tive sense of the family bond, we soon perceive the 
cosmopolitan circle, and say for ourselves: “‘ Being 
human, no human being is altogether a stranger to 
me.” I have a little more charity for the crimson- 
handed worshipers in the dark forests of Germany 
when I remember that my ancestor was there, and 
that he probably forged the blade with which the 
victims were slain. I can understand a little better 
the swift fierceness of the Viking when I see that he 
was seeking a home for my mother’s children. I 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
  
  TWO PRELIMINARY QUESTIONS 5 
feel a little nearer to my neighbor here and now 
because history reveals to me that we were brothers 
just a few generations ago, and sat around the same 
hearth fire yonder. 
I count every man a little braver because John 
Hampden and Walter Reed were men; every maid 
a little truer because Grace Darling and Elizabeth 
Zane were maids; and every woman a little nobler 
because Cornelia and Mary the mother of Washing- 
ton were women. The laughter of Sarah, the senti- 
ment of Ruth, the vanity of Darius, the hate of Elec- 
tra, the frugality of Charlemagne, the wrath of 
William, the deceitfulness of Elizabeth, and the tears 
of Marie Antoinette bring the races and the ages 
nearer together; for a ‘“‘ touch of nature makes the 
whole world kin.” If drama be a mirror to nature, 
history is its sympathetic system. 
Sixth, we should study history to make us more 
efficient citizens. ‘‘ History for its own sake” is as 
incomprehensible as ‘‘ knowledge for its own sake.” 
If knowledge for self is selfish, knowledge for itself 
isabsurd. It is knowledge for service that is wisdom. 
As a great American educator has recently put it, 
“Scholarship and knowledge fulfill themselves only 
in service to men.” ! 
History for self is selfish; history for itself is ab- 
surd. History for efficiency in service to home and 
church and state, in the present and for the future, 
1 President Edwin A. Alderman.
-P-A-G-E-18
6 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
  is history worth while. The study of history should 
make the citizen more intelligently patriotic, and 
increase his capacity for all healthy sentiment. It 
should enlarge his powers for social influence and 
constructive statesmanship. It should give him 
aggressive confidence, balanced by judicial caution. 
It should make him a seeker after the truth and the 
right in every public question, rather than a partisan 
vendor of arguments. It should give him breadth 
and perspective, and at the same time give him pene- 
tration and skill in particular cases. 
How to study history.— This is a subject which 
we should study with enjoyment, as something fasci- 
nating; with discernment, as something profound ; 
with reverence, as something bequeathed the race in 
sacred trust; with intense earnestness, as something 
vital to the welfare of society. 
Let the child study history at home, in his own 
family. Perhaps the house he lives in has a history. 
Perhaps his father or his grandfather has done or 
knows something of historical significance. There 
may be some old land patents, beautifully written 
on parchment now yellow with age, in that old desk. 
There may be files of an old newspaper, almost price- 
less now, stored away in the attic. In yonder an- 
cient chest are almost certainly some old letters 
written from Manassas in ’61, from California in ’49, 
or from the falling cities in 37. That old diary is 
now a treasure house of long-forgotten facts, and that
-P-A-G-E-19
  TWO PRELIMINARY QUESTIONS 7 
old relic may recall the story of thrilling days and 
deeds. Let all these sources and resources of the 
child’s home be utilized to wake up and lead out the 
child’s spirit. It will answer to these voices of the 
past, for they speak in familiar tones. 
Having had his historical spirit and instincts 
awakened at home, the child will readily adopt the 
methods of the school. The teacher should take 
account of what the child has already done and 
learned, or failed to do and learn. An appreciation 
of what he has will make him appreciate what the 
teacher offers, and soon the resources of the school 
will be seized upon with eagerness. 
From the school it is an easy step to the surround- 
ing neighborhood. Let the teacher and the class 
find the oldest house in town, and ascertain its 
history. If the town is a county-seat, the public 
records to be found there will prove rich and inter- 
esting. Probably in the nearest cemetery is the 
grave of some noted man or woman; and almost 
certainly there is some historic spot in the neighbor- 
hood that ought to be visited and marked before the 
very place is lost. Frequently patriotic societies 
offer prizes for essays on historical characters and 
subjects, and these may be made the means of in- 
ducing a whole class or a whole school to undertake 
special studies of interest and value. It may be that 
some person in the community has published a book 
or paper of historical content. If so, such publica-
-P-A-G-E-20
  8 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
tion should be made familiar in the school, and the 
author secured to address the history classes. 
The story of one’s home and family, his town, 
his neighborhood, his county, may not be history 
in the sense demanded by the critics; but it is a be- 
ginning; and history, like charity, may well begin 
at home. Beginning at home, the student will go 
abroad with interest, intelligence, and appreciation. 
Moreover, the principles of history and of historical 
study are all, or nearly all, truly illustrated in small 
circles and in small events as well as in large circles 
and great events. 
Let the student of history not only acquaint him- 
self with the facts that are common knowledge, but 
also add to the store by eyery possible discovery. 
And let it be part of his i to preserve what is 
in danger of being lost, as well as to discover what 
has hitherto been unknown. 
Finally, let him aim continually at tracing the 
past into the present; that

tered, voiceless fragments were neither attractive 
nor intelligible. A vital power must breathe upon 
them; a prophet’s wand must touch them; then 
they take form and motion, an exceeding great army. 
Then the martyrs of a time, the pathfinders of a 
people, the heralds of an empire pass and speak 
before us. History is not dry bones; neither are 
dry bones history; but when the prophet comes, 
when the true historian walks upon the plain, the 
dead past stirs and leaps into the living present. 
History stories have a charm, a value, and a place 
in our work, even though they are not history in the 
scientific sense. They give color to the whole hori- 
zon, and induce the eager youth to hasten toward the 
realms of light, to climb upon the heights, and there 
to see the long procession of the ages coming from the 
distant East. We shall find much need for history 
stories as we proceed in this study ; let us, therefore, 
not reject them, even though they are not strictly 
history. 
Let us open our eyes to the fact that history is not 
a small subject. Let us forever quit talking about 
“finishing ”’ English history, for example, in a year. 
Let us quit thinking that eight years in the grades 
and one more year in the high school are too many 
to give to the study of United States history. Let 
us recognize the impossibility, even by the magic of 
scientific classification, of compassing or compre- 
hending in a brief lifetime all that it has taken mil-
-P-A-G-E-24
12 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
lions of men and women, living and striving and 
suffering and conquering for uncounted centuries, 
to work out. Let us not imagine, when we have read 
a dozen or two books of history, that we have done 
more than make a beginning upon the thousands of 
books already written, or the thousands more that 
might be written. 
Again, let us not imagine that history is an easy 
subject — so easy as not to deserve our best effort 
or require the exercise of our highest powers. His- 
tory has easy phases, easy stages, and may be in- 
troduced to children to their keen delight; but 
history in its entirety presents the profoundest phi- 
losophy of human life and destiny. It has had as 
its producers the mightiest men and women of every 
nation, and it has engaged the growing interest of 
toil and genius in every land and every age. The 
fact that it is not an exact science — perhaps no 
science at all, as 2 est its demands upon 
effort and reason all the more insistent. The fact 
that it foreshadows so wonderfully the destinies of 
the race makes its claims upon us compelling. 
History is a great and an subject. It is great 
for the reasons already indicated ; it is vital because 
it is ever growing and. bee interpretation and 
application of history mean life or death to the race. 
History is the life story of the human race. Itisa 
record of the past and a prophecy for the future. It 
is like the stream of a — river, in that it has a   
 
-P-A-G-E-25
THE MEANING OF HISTORY 13 
course, a direction,-an onward movement, despite 
its many windings, turnings, and eddies; it is like 
the life of every full-grown man, in that it presents all 
the stages of progressive development, from child- 
hood to perfect manhood, without the necessity of 
death. 
The story of history is ever growing; the stream 
of history is ever widening; the life of which it tells 
is ever becoming fuller and richer. History, to be 
complete, must portray and interpret this life in its 
manifold phases; it must not neglect one phase, nor 
emphasize another phase unduly. In the writing of 
history and in the teaching of history we are now 
coming to see that it has an intellectual phase, a 
moral phase, a religious phase, an economic phase, an 
industrial phase — many social phases — as well as 
a military phase and a political phase. Peace gives 
growth; anarchy is disease; war is bitter medicine: 
these are some of the truths that the historian is 
beginning to see and to teach. 
The editor of the World’s Work has recently put 
certain facts of the case before us in the following 
good form :— 
“The changes in our economic and political life deserve 
much more attention than they usually get. As a nation 
we neglect these things. As children we are taught Ameri- 
can history as a series of wars, from the conflicts with 
the Indians and the French, down through the Revolution, 
the Mexican War, and the Civil War to our conquest of 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
    14 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
the Spanish islands. The true history of the United States 
is a succession of economic and political steps, here and 
there interrupted by war. Our more serious wars have 
been operations on the body politic. They have come 
only when some of the regular machinery of progress has 
broken down — when our politics and industry were sick. 
And the convalescence from the operation of war has been 
long and costly. 
“The old saying, ‘Happy is the nation whose annals 
are few,’ is true when you think of annals, as most of our 
historians do, as being in a large part the records of wars. 
But wars do not mark the progress of a people. They 
mark their worst periods. The real annals of a people are 
the exploits of the men of inventive genius and con- 
structive minds who make possible the ever-improving 
standards of life.” ! 
Just as social life is constructive, so history is a 
constructive science, and accordingly deals properly 
with constructive rather than with destructive forces ; 
with the positive rather than with the negative ; 
with the normal rather than with the abnormal. 
War, for example, is destructive, abnormal. It is 
a negative value, so far as progress is concerned. 
The causes, the real character, and the results of war 
may be studied with profit, and should teach the na- 
tions wisdom; but to waste the powers of history 
in the glorification of war as such is open folly. The 
biography of a man deals naturally with his healthy 
1The World’s Work, August, 1913, p. 363.
-P-A-G-E-27
  THE MEANING OF HISTORY 15 
working years and his positive achievements; not 
with his days or weeks of illness and violent delirium ; 
so history finds its proper subject matter in the 
“years of noble deeds” that enrich the paths of 
peace, and not in the mad carnage of rage and strife. 
History is properly a record of life and growth, when 
strength and beauty are increasing, and the state 
abounds in good works. Such history will tend to 
repeat itself as the world grows wiser. 
History is a wondrous chain, in which the links are 
cause and effect, forged in national eras, and com- 
posed of national and personal achievements. An 
event without a cause, a force without an effect, is 
as absurd in history as in physics. The forces of 
history work more slowly than those of physics, but 
no less surely. The sowing determines in due time 
the reaping in the life of a nation as well as in the life 
ofaman. This fact rings a warning; it also reveals 
an inheritance. We, the people of the United States 
of America, are reaping happy harvests every year 
that were sown across the seas in Greece, in Rome, in 
Germany, in Britain. Other men have labored, and 
we have entered into their labors — in benefit as 
well as in responsibility. Not a single link in the 
chain is altogether lost or broken; but some are of 
wood and stubble; some are of brass and iron; some 
are of blood and sorrow; and some are of gold. 
History is not only recordation, it is also interpre- 
tation. It records facts and interprets life. In its

full and perfect scope it begins and ends in moral 
values. The qualities of courage, justice, patience, 
industry, and self-sacrifice that distinguish the better 
makers of history are all moral qualities; and the 
finest results that we seek or realize from the making 
and learning of history are those that are registered 
in personal and national character. Achievement, 
record, interpretation, application: this is the per- 
petual cycle in which the forces of history move as 
they come from past to present, and go from present 
to future.t

  CHAPTER III 
SUBJECTS CLOSELY RELATED TO HISTORY 
Brancues of learning, like men and women, are 
found naturally in groups; and just as it helps us 
in studying a man to know something of his kinsmen, 
so in studying a science it helps us to make use of 
related subjects. Wemust, of course, beware of going 
too far afield, and we must not confuse so many 
things as to rob all of distinctness ; yet, as we concen- 
trate attention upon the subject in hand, we should 
give occasional and due recognition to those related 
subjects that stand nearest. 
History depends in a measure upon geography, 
and is vitally related to literature, music, art, civil 
government, ethics, sociology, economics, and nat- 
ural science; and in studying it we may profit 
largely by illustrating it with handwork of various 
sorts. 
In greater or less degree the geography of a country 
makes its history; and nearly every great event and 
stirring incident is associated with some particular 
place. This association should always be strength- 
ened rather than weakened; and the bonds should 
be carried over from both sides. The teacher of his- 
c 17

  18 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
tory should make a bond with geography, and the 
teacher of geography should make a bond with his- 
tory. Unfortunately, these bonds often are not 
well tied, or they are neglected altogether. In num- 
berless cases it has been observed that questions in 
historical geography are the most puzzling of all to 
history students. I fear that we teachers have not 
been doing our duty here. It may be that sometime 
the ideal textbook will be written, in which the 
things that belong together will be so skillfully and 
harmoniously joined that no man can put them asun- 
der. Then, perhaps, the proper association of his- 
tory and geography will be easy. But in the mean- 
time let us make good use of the maps, pictures, and 
geographical descriptions with which our history 
books already abound. 
It is in the study of industrial history, to which we 
are giving increasing attention, that the dependence 
geography becomes most obvious. 
Differences over great questions like slavery and the 
tariff have depended largely upon differences in geog- 
raphy. The location of great manufacturing and 
commercial cities was never an accident, but each 
place was marked out ages in advance in the geog- 
raphy of plain or river, of mountain pass or ocean 
bay. 
When we speak of history and literature we are 
merely turning the shield. For we may speak of 
history as a branch of literature, or of literature as a       
    
     
       
    
   
-P-A-G-E-31
  SUBJECTS RELATED TO HISTORY 19 
branch of history... We may not so often study 
history for its literary value, but we frequently do 
study literature for the light it gives to history. 
Literature helps to make history, and history helps 
to explain literature. How different the modern 
world would be without the English Bible and the 
poems of Milton; yet how little could we under- 
stand or appreciate either without the history in 
them and around them! He who studies literature 
without having his ear open continually to the voice 
of history limits his understanding and loses half his 
pleasure. He who follows the path of history without 
pausing before the glowing pictures that literature has 
painted robs his imagination and stifles his sentiment. 
The teacher must not confuse fact and fiction, nor 
use a novel as a textbook; but having the skeleton 
of fact well set up, well proportioned, and well articu- 
lated, let him then clothe it even with the warm flesh 
and blood of poetry and fiction. It is not alone what 
we learn that is valuable, it is what we remember. 
Poetry and fiction make the scene and the character 
so vivid and full that we cannot forget them. It is 
not alone what we understand that is helpful, it is 
what we feel and aspire to. Poetry and fiction often 
become the oratory of history, and we start up cry- 
ing, ‘‘ Let us march against Philip; let us conquer 
or die!”

20 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
John Richard Green, in discussing a certain group 
of Shakespeare’s plays, says : — 
“No dramas have done so much for Shakspere’s 
enduring popularity with his countrymen as these 
historical plays. They have done more than all the 
works of Engi historians to nourish in the minds of 
Englishmen a love of and reverence for their country’s 
past. When Chatham was asked where he had read 
his English history, he answered, ‘ In the plays of 
Shakspere.’ Honore could he have read it so well, 
for nowhere is the spirit of our history so nobly ren- 
dered.” ! 
If we are concerned about the spirit as well as the 
letter of our eare we cannot afford to neglect the 
best incarnations of that spirit. American students 
and teachers are fortunate here in a wealth of re- 
sources; for it is said that no less than forty per cent 
of the standard novels in English and American 
literature are historical in theme and setting.2 The 
number of our fine historical poems mounts into the 
hundreds. Longfellow’s ‘‘ The Skeleton in Armor ” 
and “‘ Evangeline,’ Joaquin Miller’s ‘“‘ Columbus,” 
Mrs. Hemans’s ‘‘ Landing of the Pilgrim Fathers,” 
Lanier’s ‘‘ Lexington,” Bryant’s ‘‘ Song of Marion’s 
Men,” Gallagher’s “The Mothers of the West,”

Book VI, Chapter VII.

Butterworth’s ‘“ Whitman’s Ride for Oregon,” 
Timrod’s ‘‘ The Cotton Boll,’’ Mrs. Preston’s “‘ Gone 
Forward,” and Roche’s ‘‘ Panama” are a few that 
are typical of a large class. Students and teachers 
of American history should know these poems and 
use them. 
In the Old World a great wealth of history is em- 
bodied in music and art: in ballads, in operas, in 
oratorios, in national hymns, in castles, in palaces, 
in temples, in bridges, and in the marvelous old cathe- 
drals. In the New World our corresponding re- 
sources are not so great, but they are growing; age 
will bring them to full measure; and even now we 
have enough to be helpful in many connections. 
The melodies of the plantation negroes, the primitive 
art of the Indians in textiles and pottery, the archi- 
tecture of lost races in old ruins, not to speak of the 
splendid things our own artists have wrought, will be 
utilized with increasing profit in the years to come. 
It is in art and music that we may most easily, 
perhaps, take up the golden threads that bind us to 
the other lands across the seas. The music to 
“ America ’”’ is vibrant with the history of half a 
dozen great countries of Europe. ‘‘ Maryland, My 
Maryland ”’ is sung to an old melody that comes to 
us out of the German forests; and even the tune of 
“The Star-Spangled Banner” was first heard 
through the mists and fogs of London. Mark the 
columns and capitals at the front of your school

building: they probably speak of Attica or Tus- 
cany. The bold span of the stone bridge yonder may 
be telling what builders the Romans were. The 
pointed arches of the church and the round arches of 
the colonnade all remind the grateful pupil of his Old 
World teachers. The painting on the wall may be 
Italian ; the church is probably Gothic; the towers 
at the campus gate may be Norman. Each has its 
story — its inwrought history —-for the American 
youth. The Raphaels, the Wrens, the Rossinis, 
    the Wagners, the Storys, the Copleys, and the 
Morses have been working industriously for cen- 
turies to equip the history laboratory. 
Obviously, civil government is closely related to 
history. We may say that history depends upon 
geography; that it embodies its best spirit in litera- 
ture, music, and art; and that it registers its teach- 
ing to society at large in the organized state. If we 
take the Federal Constitution, with its various 
amendments, as a text, we may find registered therein 
all the great forces, movements, and interests of 
United States history. Accordingly, in studying the 
history of our country we should take particular care 
to indicate the origins and development of our great 
forms of government. It may help the pupil’s un- 
derstanding and stimulate his interest to show him 
that “ politics’ ought to be the science of govern- 
ment; that politicians ought to be really patriotic 
statesmen; and that our forms of government, in
-P-A-G-E-35
  SUBJECTS RELATED TO HISTORY 23 
town and county, in state and nation, are only the 
great lessons of history that have been demonstrated 
in one country after another, from age to age. 
History should teach ethics to each individual 
man and woman. It makes possible the science of 
sociology, which is or ought to be ethics for the race 
in its related groups. The greatest values of history 
are moral values, and these should be registered in 
the characters of so many individuals that they ap- 
pear as dominating society asa whole. The teacher’s 
business is to see that history counts as an ethical 
factor in the life and character of each of his pupils; 
then in time the effect will be seen in the moral ele- 
vation of society at large. ‘‘ Public spirit’ and 
“ public sentiment ”’ are the names we apply to these 
forces when they become general; but they must 
take rise in individual hearts, before the faces of 
individual teachers. The teacher of history must 
not only be a teacher of ethics, as indicated, but he 
must also help to lay the foundation upon which 
other teachers of ethics, civics, and sociology build. 
In like manner, the increasing attention that is being 
given to these subjects in the schools will aid and 
supplement the teaching of history. 
Economics may be thought of as the state’s busi- 
ness policy: its system of principles and methods in 
managing its food supply, its money, its lands, and 
other forms of wealth. Most business men find 
such records as day books, ledgers, and market
-P-A-G-E-36
  24 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
records contain the history of their business. In 
like manner a town, a state, or a confederation finds 
that its day books, ledgers, and market reports have 
an industrial and a commercial value. These books 
and reports are its history — a result of public book- 
keeping. Business without bookkeeping would be 
unwise, if possible at all; and the larger the business, 
the larger the books that must be kept. Just as 
good business requires good bookkeeping, so good 
economics hehihite good history. Our national his- 
tory and our national business policies must be per- 
fected together. The expansion of social, economic, 
and industrial phases in the writing and teaching 
of American history is noticeable as a present-day 
educational tendency, and is thoroughly justified by 
our economic needs. We must not live altogether 
in the material, but we cannot live altogether out 
of it. 
Natural science, including its applications to useful 
arts and its practical operations in great inventions, 
has perhaps Cr more than anything else to make 
modern history. The invention of printing, the 
making of gunpowder, the successful use of the mari- 
ner’s oat th the cotton gin, the railroad train, the reports of in to them in their business. These 
  
steamboat, the telegraph, the sewing machine, the 
Copernican theory, the teaching of evolution, the 
practice of medicine, the wonders of modern surgery, 
have revolutionized the world. They have corre- 
   
-P-A-G-E-37

spondingly affected history. The teacher of chemis- 
try and physics and astronomy and physiology should 
have respect for the story of this marvelous progress ; 
and the teacher of history must acknowledge his debt 
and the debt of the race to the heroes and martyrs 
of science. 
Finally, the teacher of history may naturally and 
profitably introduce some handwork into his courses. 
Thereby he may secure the values of concreteness, 
tangibility; keener interest, and more thorough 
understanding. These values are specially desirable 
in the work of young pupils; and it is accordingly 
in the primary and intermediate grades that con- 
structive manual work should be given its largest 
proportion. To gather miniature poles and make 
a wigwam; to cut little logs, and build a settler’s 
cabin; to make a tiny canoe, or a tomahawk, or a 
bow and arrow, or to construct a fort and palisade, ~ 
will delight the heart of any normal boy; it will 
also train his eye and hand, and teach him history. 
The healthy girl will at the same time make a 
pair of moccasins, weave a small-size primitive 
blanket, draw pictures and maps, or paint a flag 
with no less delight and profit. In the more ad- 
vanced classes the handwork may be continued in 
the construction of notebooks, the drawing of maps, 
the making of designs and models, and in the accu- 
rate mounting and labeling of relics for the history 
museum.

CHAPTER, IV 
IMPORTANT AIMS IN THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
  Nort many years ago an instructor in one of our 
state normal schools, at the beginning of a course 
on the teaching of history, headed a blackboard out- 
line as follows: “‘ General Aims.” Before he could 
go any further a member of the class eagerly in- 
quired, “‘ In what battle did General Aims fight? ”’ 
To guard against any such misconception here I 
shall not classify aims as general and special, but 
shall present them in a sort of illogical trichotomy : 
(1) Aims of the history teacher regarding himself; 
(2) his aims regarding his manner and method; 
(3) his aims regarding the results of his work. 
Otherwise, thus: (1) What the teacher should aim at 
for and in himself; (2) what he should aim at in his 
teaching; (3) what he should aim at through his 
teaching. 
First, for himself and his work, the teacher must 
learn history. This gives him scholarship and rich 
resources in his craft. A teacher without resources 
in knowledge, in books, in many available sources 
of information and illustration, is like the capitalist 
without capital. For him, ready facts at hand, at 
32
-P-A-G-E-45
  IMPORTANT AIMS 33 
wit’s end and tongue’s end, are most desirable; but 
wealth of resource is a sine qua non. If he does not 
know the fact, he must know where and how to find 
it, if it can be found. 
Second, the teacher of history must like history. 
Tf he dislike it, he may not suffer so much himself, 
but woe to his class! He should like it so well that he 
is enthusiastic over it; then his class will find it 
delightful with him. Knowledge may or may not 
be communicated, but enthusiasm is a contagion, 
and it is bound to be communicated. If I must 
choose between the teacher with knowledge, but 
without enthusiasm, and the one with enthusiasm, 
but without much knowledge, let me follow the one 
. with enthusiasm ; for he will lead me into the ways of 
knowledge. Enthusiasm in any subject is a guaran- 
tee of acquisition and accomplishment in that sub- 
ject. 
Third, the teacher of history, of anything, must 
have an appreciation of values. The scholar may 
know history, the dilettante may like history; but 
the teacher must not only know history and love 
history, he must also perceive its bearing upon human 
life and human welfare. He must not exalt the worse 
for the better reasons, but he must exalt the real 
gods, whether the state worships them or not. 
Fourth, the teacher of history, of anything, must 
develop power in himself, force of personality. Per- 
sonality may be indefinable, but for the teacher, as 
D
-P-A-G-E-46
    34 FOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
well as for the leader of men in any field, it is indis- 
pensable. Personality is doubtless a combination of 
powers, rather than any single power. Moreover, 
these powers likely belong to that class of powers 
that are born rather than made; yet every born 
power may be weakened by neglect or misuse, or 
strengthened by intelligent purpose and exercise. 
Again, the powers that make up personality are moral 
rather than intellectual; but they are none the less 
susceptible, for this reason, to either waste or 
growth. 
What you know, my teacher, is worth much; what 
you can do is worth more; but what you are counts 
most of all, so far as real power is concerned. Men- 
tality may make you master of a book; but you must 
have soul power to be a leader and inspirer of youth. 
You may be admired for brilliancy, but you will 
be loved for sympathy and sincerity. Wit may make 
you an entertainer, but personal worth must make 
you a teacher. 
However difficult and precarious the task may be, 
I cannot refrain from making here the attempt to 
indicate what some of the things are that go to make 
up personality — a forceful personality such as the 
teacher should strive to develop. The following 
scheme is doubtless open to criticism, but it is sub- 
mitted in the hope that it may aid some teacher in 
crystallizing his aims regarding himself. _ 
Some of the things that go to make up personality :

(3) Facial Expression 
2. Intellectual: (1) Understanding, (2) Knowl-

8. Moral: (1) Honesty, (2) Frankness, (3) Sin- 
cerity, (4) Sympathy, (5) Hopefulness, 
(6) Courage, (7) Fidelity, (8) Good Humor 
Let us now consider some of the things that the 
history teacher should aim at in his teaching. Let 
us seek for the principles of his method. 
The first is simplicity. Every great subject is 
involved within itself and related codérdinately, 
superiorly, and subordinately, to many others. 
History is no exception. But the teacher who at- 
tempts to present the subject all at once, in its full 
complexity, is bound to fail; for he is attempting 
the impossible. If his pupils are children, he is ap- 
proaching absurdity. He is like the mechanic who 
points his raw apprentice to a finished watch, bidding 
him to comprehend it, without first having studied 
it piece by piece and part by part. The student of 
logic may not understand a definition of the subject to 
begin with, but after he has studied the subject 
branch by branch and step by step he should be able 
to make a definition for himself. The student of 
medicine and surgery does not seize upon the human 
body entire, but dissects it, and studies it part by 
part, nerve by nerve, organ by organ, function by 
function. The geographer could never know a con-
-P-A-G-E-48
Fe PPL te tee eee va Se eae ee aA ASST 
36 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
tinent if he looked upon it only as an adjusted and 
beautiful whole; but he must follow the windings of 
each river, climb the slopes of each mountain, and list 
the plants of each valley; then, having mastered 
each locality, one at a time, he begins to grasp rela- 
tionships, and finally rises to an appreciation of the 
vast and varied entirety. 
“ Divide and conquer ” is a good rule in war; it 
is a necessary rule in science. Logical division, with 
attendant classification, makes science. It makes 
science and leads to art. Hence, the mechanic be- 
gins with the plane, the lever, and the pulley; the 
logician begins with the word or the term or the sen- 
tence; the physician begins with a bone or a muscle 
or a hinge; the geographer begins with a brook or a 
stone or a tree. 
The master of history must see history entire, and 
know it as a wonderful, beautiful whole ; but he must 
at the same time be wise enough and skillful enough 
and patient enough to break it into pieces, and then 
nicely choose the pieces, fitting them to his pupil’s 
hands and to his own good purposes. The pieces 
are stories, biographies, scenes of primitive life; 
actions, achievements, movements ; forms of govern- 
ment, civic virtues, social dangers; health and dis- 
ease in home and state; triumphs and failures, and 
the reasons therefor. These are pieces, so to speak, 
to be seized and mastered, one by one; but anon 
they are seen to be not so much pieces as parts —
-P-A-G-E-49
  
IMPORTANT AIMS 37 
parts of a complex and wonderful whole, bound to- 
gether by multiple relationships, some obvious, some 
hidden, but all real and vital and rational. Sometime 
the pupil should be able to appreciate history in its 
complexity; but his master must lead him to that 
point of vantage through the converging paths of sim- 
plicity. 
The second principle here is clearness. It is simi- 
lar to the first, but not the same. Clearness is a 
natural consequent of simplicity, and goes a step 
or two beyond it. Simplicity comes of analysis — 
the untying of the bundle, and setting the treasures 
apart; clearness demands that the particular treas- 
ure to be viewed shall not stand behind another, and 
thus be hidden, or in a bad angle of light, and thus be 
colorless. To use another figure, simplicity results 
from the dissection of a body; but for clearness it 
may be necessary to bring each separate part near 
the eye, and perhaps to aid the eye with a micro- 
scope. 
When the teacher of history presents one character 
or one scene or one topic at a time, he is proceeding 
upon the principle of simplicity; yet he may still 
fail utterly to make anything clear. If he hurry too 
much, or use ambiguous terms, or speak only in gen- 
eralities, or fail to connect the yon and then with the 
here and now, his pupils may wonder at his learning, 
but despair at the mystery of it all. The brilliant 
teacher is in special danger of being obscure to his 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
    38 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
class. It is all so clear and plain to him that he never 
dreams that it is all shadows to them; and so he 
races on, vainly imagining that they are following; 
or he launches upon a sublime vision and soars quite 
out of their sight. To be clear and plain to them, he 
must go somewhat slowly ; he must repeat ; he must 
use concrete terms and familiar illustrations; he 
must lead his class around the thing in view, that it 
may be seen at various angles; he must bring them 
to know and to feel its relation to their own time and 
their own interests. 
The third principle to be emphasized here has 
just been suggested : it is concreteness, or vividness. 
This is really comprehended in clearness; but for 
the sake of simplicity and clearness it is now set some- 
what apart and forward. 
If I say, ‘‘ Franklin was a scientist and a patriot,” 
I may be correct ; but when you say, ‘‘ He snatched 
the lightning from the skies and the scepter from the 
tyrant’s hand,” you are certainly more concrete and 
vivid. Then the listener sees things, and hears not 
merely words; the thought assumes tangible form 
before him, and flashes upon his view. The weak 
teacher flounders about in the abstract, until both 
himself and his class are lost or bewildered. The 
strong teacher seizes the concrete and holds it up; 
his pupils see the thing and are glad. They follow 
him with delight and confidence. The gems are un- 
locked from their caskets, and set in the blazing sun.
-P-A-G-E-51
  
IMPORTANT AIMS ioe 
Great facts and deeds are not only made visible, they 
are made to shine and burn and glow. 
The fourth thing that the history teacher must 
aim at in his teaching has also been suggested under 
the head of clearness. It is vitality — the past 
functioning in the present. Some one has defined 
sociology as the live end of history, and history as 
the dead end of sociology. There is herein a sinister 
implication that history is not a live subject. This, 
however, is no more true than the common state- 
ment that Greek and Latin are dead languages. If 
we mean that they do not at present live in human 
speech, we are much in error; for even our English 
is largely Latin and Greek. No great language is 
dead, or can ever die; for if all the words were 
finally lost from the tongues of men, the masterpieces 
of its literature would still survive instory, in thought, 
and in sentiment. If Homer, for example, could be 
translated entirely out of the Greek language, he still 
would live in the literature of the world. If Sappho’s 
very name were lost, we should still hear her sweet 
voice singing to us out of the shadows; and in the 
voices of those whose names we know it might be 
her melody, after all, that would be charming us 
most. ; : 
Doubtless Henry Sumner Maine exaggerated when 
he said, ‘‘ Except the blind forces of nature, there is 
nothing that moves in the world to-day that is not 
Greek in origin ’’; yet we may be sure that the real  
-P-A-G-E-52
  40 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
forces of the past are still living, moving forces. 
They always will be so; they always must be so; for, 
after all, the forces that really move society are com- 
paratively few, and they are eternal. They are 
such things as desire for life, desire for liberty, am- 
bition, love, selfishness, joy in achievement, and 
concern for the future. Since the same forces are at 
work in America to-day that were at work in Rome 
when Cesar lived, the history of Cesar’s Rome is 
not a dead thing to us, or a thing that we cannot 
understand. Wherever in the past we find joy and 
sorrow, hope and despair, benevolence and service, 
the human soul enters in with a sense of fellowship, 
and the hearts of other ages throb against our own. 
The human race that is reading history to-day is the 
same human race that wrote history yesterday, only 
grown a little older and, let us hope, a little wiser. 
Especially on the institutional side, in such things as 
forms of government, church organization and teach- 
ing, social life and domestic values, history is ever 
proving its eternal vitality. The teacher of history 
must find these springs of life. They are indeed 
fountains of youth for every generation. 
Once more, the teacher in his teaching must utilize 
the great principle of adaptation. The history 
teacher especially must do this; for in history we 
must put ourselves in the place of others. It is 
often difficult to do this adequately — to put our- 
selves into another land, another age, with sympathy
-P-A-G-E-53
IMPORTANT AIMS 41 
and justice, or to bring a kinsman of the past into 
our company with grace and pleasure. Every pro- 
cess in method must be squared by the principle of 
adaptation. It demands wise selection of topics and 
materials ; it determines the order and arrangement 
of courses ; it applies in the preference given to text- 
books; it meets the teacher at every turn, demand- 
ing of him knowledge, wisdom, tact, and skill. 
Adaptation is the fundamental principle in the 
world useful, as in all the world beautiful. The three 
great kingdoms of matter — mineral, vegetable, and 
animal — act everywhere in marvelous adjustment. 
A similar coédperative harmony binds the kingdoms 
of mind in efficient unity. A world without adapta- 
tion in action, in form, in color, would be tiring and 
deadening. Suppose, for example, that every human 
figure were surmounted by the same face; that all 
hats and suits of clothes were made in advance, of 
the same fabric, the same color, the same design, the 
same size; suppose that in music a funeral dirge 
were in no wise different from a Christmas hymn; 
and suppose that my teacher of history is using the 
same method in high school to-day that he used in 
the fifth grade ten years ago! 
The teacher must not only utilize the principle of 
adaptation, but must be sure to apply it at the right 
place. We have all heard the story of the despot 
with the iron bedstead. No objection to the material 
perhaps, for we prefer iron bedsteads to-day. No 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
42 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
  objection, either, to the passion for fitness — we like 
snug fits to-day; but we do criticize the despot’s 
judgment when he chose to do his cutting or stretch- 
ing on the guest instead of on the bedstead. We 
say he had a good principle, but he applied it at the 
wrong place. 
Having thus hastily reviewed, first, what the his- 
tory teacher should aim at for and in himself 
and, second, what he should aim at in his teaching, 
let us now in the third place consider what he should 
aim at through his teaching. 
Is it his salary? Is it a better position? Or is it 
a better school system? a better citizenship? a 
better country? a better patriotism? a better age 
to come? 
Dr. Oscar I. Woodley said in a lecture a few years 
ago that he and his teachers had worked out the 
following statement of the history teacher’s ultimate 
aim :— 
“The essential purpose of history is to give an 
idea of individual and national worth, and the means 
by which they have been developed; so that the 
child knowing these may be persuaded to do the 
things and to live the life that will make for the wel- 
fare of himself and the state.” 
As a general statement this is deemed so good that 
no change or comment is attempted; however, in 
an effort to aid the teacher in more specific terms, the 
following paragraphs are offered.
-P-A-G-E-55
IMPORTANT AIMS 43 
My teacher of history should increase my capacity 
for real happiness, and sharpen my appreciation for 
all things beautiful and for all persons noble and 
honorable. He should help me to see that righteous- 
ness exalts a nation, and that sin not only is a reproach 
to any people, but has also been the downfall of great 
empires. While keeping me away from the notion 
of the ancient East, that the citizen exists for the 
state, he should also defend me against the error of 
the modern West, that the state exists for the citizen. 
He should somehow get the ages face to face upon 
the golden balance, and show me that the obliga- 
tions are mutual; that I as a citizen have some- 
thing to give as well as something to get; and that 
no state can rise above the lifting arm of its average 
citizen. 
My teacher of history should quicken my sympa- 
thies and moderate my judgments. He should make 
me more charitable — more judicial in my spirit, and 
less subject to impetuous impulse. He should stir 
up in me a love of truth, and get me to read history 
for the truth I may learn, rather than for the argu- 
ments I may find for my creed or my party. 
My teacher of history should increase my efficiency 
as an active factor in a progressive age. He should 
enable me to see that great constructive statesmen 
like Hamilton and Madison have also been profound 
students of the past, and that theory and practice 
are, after all, but different phases of the same life. 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
    44 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
He should open my eyes to the crag beacons as well 
as to the harbor lights; for, while 
“T doubt not through the ages one unceasing purpose 
runs, 
And the thoughts of men are widened with the process 
of the suns,” 
I still must know that 
“Cursed be the social wants that sin against the strength 
of youth ! 
Cursed be the social lies that warp us from the living 
truth !” 
He should teach me the great fact that the splendid 
ideals of citizenship embodied in the movements 
for world peace are ‘“‘ better ” rather than “‘ newer ”’ ; 
that they are as old as eternity ; and that they always 
have been better, but are just now, in our glorious 
day, appearing so upon a wider and brighter horizon. 
SUMMARY 
The first set of aims herein discussed contemplates 
knowledge and character in the teacher — his resource 
and personality; the second set contemplates his success 
in imparting knowledge; the third set contemplates 
a resulting strength of character and range of efficiency 
in the pupil.

CHAPTER V 
A SURVEY OF THE HISTORICAL FIELD 
A DEGREE of orientation is always desirable, and it 
is usually helpful. Put down in a new country, we 
watch for the sunrise; we mark the trend of the 
mountain ranges; we note the course of the rivers; 
and we ask, “‘ How far is it to the sea?’ In Wash- 
ington City we locate ourselves habitually by the 
Monument and the Capitol dome. In New York 
we are glad to catch a glimpse once in a while of the 
Metropolitan tower, the Woolworth Building, or the 
Statue of Liberty. And in Philadelphia, playing 
mathematics, we take Market Street and Broad 
Street as rectangular coérdinates, Penn’s statue 
surmounting City Hall as the elevated center, and 
proceed to mark out all sorts of loci, with Independ- 
ence Hall, Carpenters Hall, the old Flag House, and 
Franklin’s grave as some of the fixed points. 
In history we cannot see the end or the beginning ; 
neither can we get an open view clear across the field ; 
but we can determine east and west; we can gauge 
somewhat the direction of study; we can look out 
upon what others have done, and forward upon 
what we ourselves may do. The teacher of history, 
45 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
46 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
especially, should have some rather definite notions 
of place, relation, scope, and direction in the history 
field. This brief chapter, with the accompanying 
diagram, is intended to help the teacher and the 
student locate themselves. 
We advocate a lifetime of growth in the under- 
standing and appreciation of history, as well as a 
schooltime of specially arranged and skillfully directed 
study. We may begin to teach the child his kind 
of history in the first grade of school; we ought to 
begin it in the home, before he goes to school at all; 
we should continue our work, helping turn childhood 
into youth, and helping the youth become a man 
upon the stronger meat of sterner facts. At first 
the parent and teacher do nearly everything for the 
child; at last the man should be able to do nearly 
everything for himself. At first the subject matter 
selected is simple and easy ; at last, choosing for him- 
self, the man may take what he finds, even though it 
bea truth so great and so revolutionary that it shift 
the center from the earth to the sun in the historical 
universe. At first the child has no book — he has 
something better, a teacher ; at last the man not only 
has books, but he is also able to make other books, 
and to be that better thing, a teacher. 
Wherever we live, we have the history of all the 
world before us and about us; but naturally and 
properly we study first what is nearest — nearest in 
place, if not in time. As already suggested, history, 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
  A SURVEY OF THE HISTORICAL FIELD 4? 
like charity, should begin at home. Accordingly, 
those people who live in New York begin with the 
history of the New Netherlands; those who live in 
Michigan begin with the heroic journeys of Mar- 
quette and others who bore the lilies of France and 
taught the word of the Cross; and we who live in 
Virginia begin with the failures and triumphs of Ra- 
leigh and Smith and Pocahontas. Carrying this prin- 
ciple still farther, each child may begin with the his- 
tory of his own people and his own neighborhood. 
This is the natural thing, the easy thing, the inter- 
esting thing. The child may not understand the 
people and the things far off in time and place, but 
he will take proper delight in knowing about his own 
family, his father’s house, his town; and, in time, 
about his state, his country, his world. 
Indian life and the pioneer life of the white people, 
in both of which children find a “ happy hunting 
ground,” may frequently be studied to best advan- 
tage in the child’s own community. At the same 
time he gets occasional introductory glimpses into 
the greater world in the appropriate celebration 
of Thanksgiving, Washington’s birthday, the Fourth 
of July, Christmas, and other holidays. 
If the course is well laid out in advance, the Ameri- 
can boy, coming to the last of the grades, will have 
pushed out to the wider historical bounds of his united 
country, without profitless or tedious retreading 
of beaten paths; yet all the while his main work has 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
48 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
been limited to his own United States. He has 
learned something of European history, particularly 
English history, and perhaps a good deal of older 
world history; but these have come in for the most 
part incidentally, to explain or illustrate or enforce 
what he has found here. With him American his- 
tory has been the fundamental thing throughout, 
even though he has been able to comprehend it only 
in an elementary degree. He has had a good intro- 
duction for further study, if he continue in school ; 
and some preparation for life as a citizen of his own 
country, if he must at once face the world. 
In the high school the boy or girl may well begin 
with ancient history, and give special attention to 
Athens, Rome, and Jerusalem. The second year 
he may come on down the ages, following the star 
of destiny westward, peering after its gleam in the 
uncertain darkness, and rejoicing at its greater light 
when the age of confused uncertainties passes. 
Medieval history is rich in chivalry and romance, 
thrilling in tragedy and pathos, and illuminating, in 
spite of its shadows, to the student of modern insti- 
tutions. The normal boy and girl will find the 
Middle Age a delightful period of study for the sec- 
ond year of high school. 
The third year of high school may very properly 
be devoted chiefly to the history of Great Britain, 
our great mother land; and then in the fourth year 
the student, with maturing powers and amplified
-P-A-G-E-61
  A SURVEY OF THE HISTORICAL FIELD 49 
resources of knowledge, may profitably take up again 
the history and government of the United States, his 
own country. He will then comprehend many 
things that puzzled him in the grades, and appre- 
ciate many things that before seemed to him without 
meaning. 
In college the student of history may be allowed 
increasing privilege of election, and if he act wisely 
he will certainly shape his choices according to his 
plan of life. If his plan contemplate a university 
course, his elections will gradually converge toward 
a special field, unless he should be seeking only a 
rather vague general culture. 
In reference to books of history, it will probably 
be best not to burden the child with a textbook be- 
fore the fourth year in school. Much will depend 
upon the teacher. The better the teacher, the less 
the need for a book in the hands of the child. The 
teacher must of course know books and use books 
in the process of teaching the child; and if the child 
wishes to read, and can be provided with a suitable 
book, let him read; but do not burden him with a 
heavy book or discourage him with a dry book. 
Beginning with the fourth grade, or thereabouts, 
the child should be able to use some books with 
profit and pleasure. In order that he may do so, the 
parent or the teacher must make a judicious selec- 
tion. of books for him, adapting them to his knowl- 
edge and capacity, as well as to the plan of the school 
E
-P-A-G-E-62
  50 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
course. As he grows, the books should grow with 
him, still being nicely adapted to his powers and the 
teacher’s plans. In most cases the error will be com- 
mitted in selecting a book too difficult for the child. 
Let the teacher beware of supposing that because a 
book is elementary and simple to him it is necessarily 
so to the boy or girl in his class. But by the time the 
pupil has reached the third year of the high school he 
ought to be able to use almost any book, at least, for 
supplementary work. The regular textbooks should 
still be carefully chosen for him. 
An effort is made to show graphically in the ap- 
pended outline a comprehensive scheme of the history 
field, A, regarding books, B, regarding schools and 
courses of study, as presented in the foregoing 
paragraphs. 
The graded book lists incorporated in Chapter VII 
are intended to conform to this outline, particularly 
to the left-hand section of it, and to carry out some- 
what in specific titles the recommendations herein 
made in’ general suggestions. The subject groups 
offered in the same chapter (VII) will be seen to 
conform similarly to that part of the outline which 
has reference to the course of study that may be 
given in the grades of the elementary school. The 
four-year course of study in history outlined and 
recommended for high schools in Chapter IX will 
also be found in close agreement with the scheme 
herewith indicated.

CHAPTER VI 
THE PLACE AND TIME TO BEGIN THE STUDY 
OF HISTORY 
We are disposed to look upon all beginnings as 
more or less difficult; yet many — even many of 
the right sort — are very easy. It depends largely 
upon the spirit in which we start out, and whether 
we fall in with the natural order of things or not. 
In teaching history the parent may begin at home, 
as soon as the child takes an interest in people 
and their doings. Yonder hangs an old picture upon 
the wall. It was painted long ago by the child’s 
grandfather; and it represents an old tavern, with a 
group of men, some on horseback, before it. That 
picture has a story, a story that fits into the history 
of the community and the nation; and the child’s 
ancestors helped to make that story. How natural 
and easy it is to stir up the child’s intelligent interest 
in that picture and in that story. 
Above the fireplace hangs an old sword. Out on 
the green lawn is a great tree. At the next corner of 
the street is an old stone house. In a dark corner of 
the barn is an old stagecoach. Each of these has its 
story —a story of action, of danger, of heroism — 
52
-P-A-G-E-65
  
PLACE AND TIME TO BEGIN THE STUDY 53 
that the child will eagerly hear from the lips of parent 
or teacher. 
At school, even in the first grade, the resourceful 
teacher will find or make numberless subjects and 
occasions for stirring the child’s historical curiosity. 
There are flags and pictures on the walls; there are 
many curious old relics in the museum; some child 
in the room has a meaningful name; another one has 
found a flint arrowhead or a tomahawk in a newly 
plowed field; there is a small stone marker, with 
some words on it, in the public square, and a tall 
white shaft of marble among the trees in the ceme- 
tery; and every month or two there comes along a 
historical holiday. Each of these presents an oppor- 
tunity to the history teacher for beginning her work. 
They come into the way so easily and naturally that 
the child may enter the history path and travel long 
upon it before realizing that it presents any tasks at 
all. Along with the stories from real objects and 
persons at hand, the skillful teacher may readily 
introduce many others from the books. 
In most graded and high schools the history work 
follows, and in every one it should follow, a carefully 
prepared outline covering every year, from the first 
to the last. Under such conditions the versatile 
teacher should find it easy to adjust herself to her 
particular place in the scheme. She may readily 
see what work has gone before, and what work 
will follow after, her own; and so will be able to set
-P-A-G-E-66
54 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
forth upon her own work intelligently, and to give 
to it the proper scope and bearing. 
In a poorly graded school, or a so-called graded 
school that has no scheme at all for the several sub- 
jects from year to year, the first step is to get a good 
scheme adopted. In a single-room, ungraded school 
the teacher has much freedom for her talents and 
judgment; yet even here nothing will perhaps aid 
her so much as adopting a comprehensive plan, 
dividing the possible history work into seven or eight 
parts, allotting to each part a session of school. The 
several classes may then be set into this scheme. If 
the teacher remain for a second or a third year at 
the same school, she will find her hard planning of 
the first year making easier working ever afterward. 
If she go elsewhere, she should leave to her successor 
a copy of her scheme, with memoranda indicating the 
location of each class in the scheme. 
Probably it is in the normal schools that the teacher 
will find greatest difficulty in knowing just how and 
where to begin. Even if the same course in history 
and history teaching be required in all the secondary 
schools of any particular state, the normal school 
teacher will still have somewhat of the difficulty sug- 
gested, since it is hardly possible that all his pupils 
will have the same kind or the same degree of prepara- 
tion. It would hardly be desirable to require so 
much uniformity throughout the high schools of any 
state in the teaching of any subject that a hundred
-P-A-G-E-67
PLACE AND TIME TO BEGIN THE STUDY 55 
different pupils, from as many different schools, could 
be warranted in advance to fill exactly the same 
measure. Such a thing would not be possible if it 
were desirable. 
Accordingly, when the history teacher in a normal 
school is confronted by a hundred or more young 
men and women from different sections and from dif- 
ferent schools, with different kinds and degrees of 
training, with different habits and traditions, it may 
be well for him to take soundings a little in the harbor 
before launching out into the open seas. 
If the first part of the normal school course be de- 
voted to a review or a new view of subject matter as 
such, conditions are materially helped in various 
ways. If, on the other hand, the course from the 
beginning deal primarily with principles and methods, 
the teacher must start farther out at sea; but in 
either case a cordial relationship of mutual acquaint- 
ance should be established between the teacher 
and his class as soon as possible and as thoroughly 
as possible. The first few days of the session may 
well be devoted to such adjustment and to locating 
a few cardinal points. For such purposes the fol- 
lowing plan has been found valuable. 
Take the first four or five days for general intro- 
ductory work, proceeding somewhat after this 
fashion : — 
First day. — Enroll the class by having each mem- 
ber of it write down upon a card her full name and
-P-A-G-E-68
56 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
home address, including town, county, and state. 
Cards of convenient size should be provided for this 
purpose by the teacher or by the school. If cards 
are provided by the school for registration in the 
class, but do not secure the student’s home address, as 
indicated above, in form convenient for the teacher’s 
use, the latter may well have a second set of cards 
filled out for his own desk. Thereby he may secure 
several advantages. In the first place, he will have 
the names of his pupils in convenient form for alpha- 
betical or other arrangement. In the second place, 
he will have an illuminating index to the characters 
and habits of the different ndividuals in the exact- 
ness or inexactness, the neatness or lack of it, with 
which the cards are filled out. In the third place, 
he may classify his pupils as to locality, and thus 
not only gauge them with reference to their probable 
opportunities and training, but also determine in 
adequate measure some vantage grounds of appeal 
in getting at one with them. 
The enrolling of the class, as suggested, will require 
only a few minutes; accordingly the greater part of 
the hour will remain for something else. There may 
be upon the blackboard, written there in advance, 
a list of, say, thirty-five easy, interesting, small books 
of history — preferably American history. This 
list of thirty-five may be divided into five equal 
groups labeled respectively A— D, E—H, I—M, 
N—R,S—Z. Say to the class : —
-P-A-G-E-69
  PLACE AND TIME TO BEGIN THE STUDY 57 
“You will find in the school library two or more copies 
of each of these books. They are all little books, easy and 
interesting. I want each one of you to get one of these 
books and read as much of it as you can during the next 
two or three days. Read it all if you can. Read it as 
a pleasure, not as a task; yet try to remember it well 
enough to be able to tell something about it afterwards 
if you should be given a chance to do so. All of you whose 
family names begin with A, B, C, or D may take a book 
in the first group; all whose names begin with E, F, G, 
or H may take one from the second group; and so on.” 
Some minutes of the period will likely still remain. 
These may be devoted to any general or special talk 
that the teacher deems appropriate. 
Second day. — The first half of the period may well 
be employed in securing from each pupil carefully 
written answers to the following questions : — 
1. How long have you been studying history ? 
2. What book of history did you first read or study? 
3. Name all the other books of history you have read 
or studied, so far as you can now recall them. 
4. Do you like history, or not? 
5. Give reasons why you like it, or why you do not 
like it. 
The remainder of the hour may be used for another 
general or special lecture. 
Third day. — Have the answers to the above ques- 
tions carefully tabulated, and take the whole hour 
to go over them and discuss them with the class.
-P-A-G-E-70
58 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
This will be an exercise of exceeding interest and 
profit to both teacher and pupils. 
Fourth day. — Call on two or three members from 
each of the five groups to make brief reports on the 
books read. This will give the teacher opportunity 
to make some helpful remarks and to secure some 
helpful observations. It will add to the class’s 
general stock of information. It will give the pupils 
reporting a sort of experience on their feet that should 
be valuable in their preparation for teaching. It will 
do much to promote acquaintance and a spirit of good 
fellowship in the class ; and it will impress each pupil, 
at the outset, with the fact that part of one’s business 
in preparing to teach is to get acquainted with books. 
Fifth day. — The first half of the period may ap- 
propriately be given to a preliminary talk on note- 
books and the methods of taking notes in class, in the 
library, or in other places. The second half may be 
used to explain the rules by which the work of the 
pupil is to be estimated : what values will be credited 
to regular attendance, to oral recitation, to written 
reports, to written tests, to deportment, and to 
general attitude toward the subject and the work. 
The first regular assignment in a textbook may be 
made at this time. 
It is confidently believed that the first week may 
be spent upon introductory work of the sort indicated 
with greater profit than would ordinarily be realized 
by plunging at once into regular routine. But let
-P-A-G-E-71

the plan outlined above, or any plan, be modified or 
supplanted altogether according to the judgment of 
each instructor, as he studies his own pupils and their 
needs. Skillful adaptation is always the chief thing 
to be sought in every plan, in every method, in every 
place. I would lay down only one ironclad rule: Be 
the master of every rule. Let no plan be so iron- 
clad that it cannot be modified or discarded for im- 
provement. 
Common sense must always be a saving grace. 
The teacher who says, “ There is just one way — my 
way ”’ is several centuries out of his time and place. 
He would have done fairly well in medieval Europe, 
but old Egypt or China was his proper home. ‘“ Born 
after his time ” should be inscribed over his door. 
The paths of progress lead elsewhere.?

CHAPTER VII 
HISTORY IN THE GRADES 
Every school should have a well-defined course 
mapped out for the work in history, assigning partic- 
ular phases or portions of the work to the successive 
years, in a progressive series. 
The advantages of such a plan are obvious. 
Thereby each teacher, according to her grade, or the 
grade of her class, can at once fit herself into the 
scheme, knowing where to begin and where to stop. 
She can determine in fair measure what preparation 
her pupils have had in the subject, and what they still 
lack. Needless duplication and identical repetition 
from year to year can be avoided. Having the field 
apportioned to a definite number of years, the several 
teachers should be able to cover it all in the allotted 
time; and, at the same time, since the work of each 
year is limited to a comparatively brief period, or 
to only a few subjects, each teacher, or the same 
teacher from year to year, has a chance to work more 
or less intensively. Extension is assured by the 
scheme as a whole, and intension is made possible by 
circumscribing a part of the field, year by year. 
In most schools the teacher will doubtless find the 
60 ee a
-P-A-G-E-73
HISTORY IN THE GRADES 61 
course of study for each year or each grade already 
mapped out, and her skill in consequence may be 
addressed chiefly to the task of adapting herself to 
the system and at the same time shaping her part of 
the system upon her ideals. In such cases the text- 
books also, and the chief reference books, will prob- 
ably be selected in advance for her. Nevertheless, 
she should have at least opinions of her own — them 
she should claim the right of shaping for herself. 
She should be able soon to reach a conclusion as to 
whether the plan of the course is a good one; whether 
the textbooks she is given are good in themselves; 
and whether they are adapted to the grade for which 
they are provided. She should be able thus not 
only to reach intelligent conclusions, but also to exert 
some influence in a proper and tactful way to get 
conditions changed if they ought to be changed. 
In case the teacher is so unfortunate as to get into 
a school that has no course of study already outlined, 
she should be able to help matters by outlining a 
course at once. The lack may be her opportunity. 
As a possible aid in such a contingency, and as a 
means of expressing some opinions in tabular form, 
the following outline of history for the grades is sub- 
mitted. Since it is for American schools it is devoted 
mainly to American history. European history and 
older world history are brought in rather sparingly, 
and to explain rather than to supplement American 
history. The author has no prejudice against the
-P-A-G-E-74
  62 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
history of the Old World, he loves it; but the his- 
tory of our own country is so vast and so essential 
that we cannot afford to be sidetracked too much 
until we have in a fashion compassed it. 
Moreover, it should be remembered that the child, 
in a good school or in a good home, is by no means 
wholly dependent upon the history course for knowl- 
edge of Old World treasures. Much Old World 
history is touched upon through his studies in litera- 
ture, art, music, and geography, and should be so 
touched upon consciously and deliberately. Reader 
selections, biographical studies, Sunday school les- 
sons, and such material frequently present a rich 
background in the Old World, and enhance the 
child’s appreciation of distant lands and distant 
ages. 
For the course in history for the grades, as pre- 
sented below, the following distinctive features are 
claimed : — 
1. An effort is made to unify the whole by a 
rather close adherence to the American field. Con- 
sequently, only a small amount of foreign matter is 
introduced, and such only as has an obvious bearing 
on American history. 
2. By this close adherence to the American field 
it has been possible to introduce into the course 
certain important topics not usually given place in 
our history courses, for example, social and industrial 
topics like the following: The Story of Steam, The
-P-A-G-E-75
HISTORY IN THE GRADES 63 
Story of Iron, The Story of Cotton, Great American 
Missionaries, Great American Educators, and Great 
American Women. 
8. The chronological order is completed in the 
seventh grade, thus to afford a practicable course 
for seven-grade schools, while the topics presented 
for the eighth grade are selected with a view to 
giving the most desirable work possible in that year 
for eight-grade schools. 
4. In the book list following each grade an attempt 
is made to classify the books in groups corresponding 
to the several topics or groups in the outline; and 
from the fifth grade on two lists are given: one for 
the pupil, one for the teacher. 
Grade I 
SUBJECT 
Group 1. Easy history stories, developed from local subjects. 
2. Glimpses of Indian life, given during Indian Summer. 
8. Thanksgiving stories, centering about Thanksgiving. 
4. Christmas stories, centering about Christmas. 
5. Stories from the life of Robert E. Lee, centering about

6. Stories from the life of Abraham Lincoln, centering about 
Lincoln’s birthday, February 12. 
7. Stories from the life of George Washington, centering about 
Washington’s birthday, February 22. This series may be 
extended over a couple of months, and embrace many features 
of pioneer life and Indian life. 
8. Stories from the life of Daniel Boone, continuing the por- 
traiture of primitive life in America.

9. Various forms of construction work on sand tables, etc., 
may be employed throughout to give concreteness and attrac- 
tiveness to the lessons. 
10. Frequent excursions may be made to places of historical 
interest near the school.

Channing, Hart, and Turner, published by Ginn & Co., Boston, 
contains on pages 62-89 lists of local histories for every or nearly 
every state in the Union. By means of this directory, or a 
similar one, the teacher in most cases will be able to find some 
publication relating to his own particular section.

See List, Grade I: Group 8. 
Suggestions and materials for various celebrations will be 
found in educational journals and in occasional publications of 
schools, societies, the Federal bureau of education, state depart- 
ments of public instruction, etc. 
It will be observed that no attempt is made to put forward 
dates and chronology, as such, in the early grades. Some dates 
will naturally be learned, and a few may be taught incidentally ; 
   
-P-A-G-E-81

but the consecutive arrangement of facts, events, and move- 
ments, and the fixing of dates, will more properly come later. 
At this early stage the child is making personal acquaintances, 
gathering materials, and completing small circles. He is also 
finding his own powers. 
Grade III 
SUBJECT 
Group 1. Stories of Queen Elizabeth, Sir Walter Raleigh, and 
Virginia Dare; John Smith and Pocahontas ; Henry Hudson and 
the Half Moon; the Cavaliers and the Puritans; the Pilgrims

CHAPTER VIII 
A SUMMARY OF AIMS AND METHODS FOR THE 
GRADES 
ir is my purpose to bring together here, in brief 
compass, a. number of the things already presented 
in the preceding chapters, and in connection with 
these a few others that have perhaps not been men- 
tioned hitherto. 
We may do well to begin the teaching of history in 
the first grade, even in the home before the child goes 
to school at all, if we begin in a natural and sensible 
way — that is, largely in the child’s way or in ways 
that the child will understand and appreciate; and 
we may continue to teach history as long as the school 
course continues: through the high school, the col- 
lege, the university, or the professional school. Yet 
in every process and in every period of the course 
we must study the pupil as well as the facts we are 
trying to teach him, and consider carefully our ways 
of doing things with him. In short, we must ob- 
serve a good many cautions as well as some recom- 
mendations. 
Do not burden the child at first with a textbook. 
This caution should naturally suggest itself if we be- 
98
-P-A-G-E-111
SUMMARY OF AIMS AND METHODS 99 
gin teaching the child history before he can read. 
But even after he can read a little, let us be care- 
ful about thrusting books upon him. With a good 
teacher he may get along very well without a history 
book in his own hands until he comes into the fourth 
grade. Do not construe this as an iron-clad rule for 
every case. Every case must be decided for itself. 
The child is the main factor; the subject and the cir- 
cumstances count for something; the books avail- 
able must be taken into account; the teacher is the 
wise judge. If the child wants to read history stories, 
or books of that nature, before the fourth grade, by 
all means let him do so. All I say is, Do not burden 
him with a textbook. This means, do not force a 
textbook into his unwilling hands; do not give him 
one that is too heavy for him, even if he is willing to 
receive it. 
With a wise teacher almost any. rule will work 
well; with an unwise teacher almost any rule is 
dangerous. : 
Do not confuse the little child with dates, and do 
not terrify him with skeletons. Dates are necessary- 
in the complete scheme of history,_but_you_ must-not— 
undertake to teach the little child history in its com- 
pleteness. Skeletons are the framework, or archi- 
tectural fundamentals, of history, shown in their 
bare outlines. Skeletons, too, are necessary, in his- 
tory as well as in anatomy, but in teaching children 
I do not believe we should show skeletons to start
-P-A-G-E-112
100 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
with. It seems much better to study first some of the 
beautiful things of the outside, whether we are study- 
ing the human body, a tree, or history. 
Tell the little child a story, a story of some man or 
woman that helped to make a bit of history, some- 
where, sometime. Tell him a story, and then tell it 
to him again. Do not tell him too many different 
stories at first. Too many will confuse him. When 
you have told him a good story, have him tell it to 
you. 
Celebrate a few holidays — three or four a year; 
more, if convenient and desirable. Make what you 
present in words or in action as full of detail, as vivid 
with color, and as impressive as possible. Vividness 
and impressiveness will generally be secured in pro- 
portion as things are made concrete. The abstract 
is almost certain to be a fatal wilderness to all chil~ 
dren, and also to many a self-approved Joshua. 
Avoid complex stories and complex situations with 
beginiiers. As the child grows the situations and 
stories may grow; but nothing very difficult or com- 
plicated should be attempted in the first four or five 
grades. All along here it is the teacher’s business 
to make things simple, rather than to twist them up 
for the fun of untangling them. 
In order to give much to your pupils, get full of the 
subject yourself. Getting the facts well in hand is 
not enough. An encyclopedia is full of facts, but it 
does not usually prove the best teacher. As a
-P-A-G-E-113
  SUMMARY OF AIMS AND METHODS 101 
teacher, a living teacher for living pupils, you need 
to get full of the spirit of your subject; of botany, if 
you teach botany; of literature, if you teach litera- 
ture; and of history, if you teach history. Beware 
of a zeal without knowledge, but do not imagine that 
a knowledge without zeal is much better — for a 
teacher of children. 
Get some good manuals — guidebooks for teachers 
of history — and make yourself very familiar with the 
one or two that seem to meet your needs most fully. 
Do not imagine that a stack of such books that you 
have never studied, and to which you never refer, 
is going to help you much. In the second place, do 
not be so foolish as to try to do everything the guide- 
book suggests. Every manual ought to be compre- 
hensive enough to meet the needs of many teachers 
and many different classes: it would be folly for a 
single teacher to explode it all upon the heads of a 
single class in a single session. In the third place, 
dare to do some things for yourself — some things 
that are not in the manuals at all. There is little 
hope for a teacher who is afraid to do a thing, good 
though she is convinced it is, until she has glanced 
anxiously into her guidebook to assure herself that 
it has the stamp of authority. Such a person is not 
areal teacher. Such a person is a slave to conven- 
tion, a moral coward, and has no right in the noble 
ranks of the teaching profession. A teacher must 
have courage, and must be willing to face the criti- 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  102 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
cism that is always one of the rewards of leadership. 
Teachers have the right to be pioneers; and no au- 
thority, however renowned, has a monopoly upon 
invention and skill. 
Seize your surroundings: the objects within reach 
and sight that have historical values; the incidents 
of the hour, and the passing anniversaries of notable 
events of long ago. Seize the time, then, as well as 
the surroundings, for both are eloquent in your aid. 
The teacher, like the orator, must make the place 
and the occasion reénforce his utterance. Napoleon 
could not have spoken so forcefully except in the 
shadow of the pyramids, and Lincoln’s most famous 
address could not have been uttered anywhere else 
so finely as at Gettysburg. 
In celebrating holidays, such as Discovery Day 
(October 12) and Thanksgiving, in describing the 
Indians and pioneers, and in portraying primitive 
life in its various phases, use constructions as well 
as stories. A large sand table is a fine foundation for 
temporary structures. Upon it may soon be grown 
a forest of cedar, pine, and oak; at one place may be 
a wigwam, at another a settler’s cabin in a clearing. 
Yonder may be a fort of stone or logs, surrounded 
by a palisade. A piece of glass set down on the 
bottom of the table may represent a lake or an arm 
of the sea; and upon it may be placed some boats or 
a tiny ship. 
Maps and sketches on the blackboard, drawings
-P-A-G-E-115
  SUMMARY OF AIMS AND METHODS 103 
on paper, bows and arrows, moccasins, household 
utensils, and farming implements, each made of suit- 
able materials, may all be thought of as possibilities 
under the head of constructions. 
Utilize the resources of your community for his- 
torical excursions of larger or smaller compass.’ 
Drill yourself in the art of story-telling, by cultivat- 
ing the qualities of directness, clearness, simplicity, 
and sympathy. Get your children to hunting for 
stories, and urge each one to find a new one if possible, 
one that has never been written down or printed in a 
book. 
Have a museum for history, as well as a library, and 
make use of it. For small children — for pupils in 
the first three or four grades — a good museum is 
worth ten times as much as a library. Let the chil- 
dren help build up the museum. This process will 
be a good sort of training in itself, and will develop 
intelligent interest and school spirit. Many old 
cast-off utensils and fabrics of several generations 
past, that will soon be destroyed or lost, if not cared 
for by proper hands, may be gathered together at the 
school with great profit.? 
Remember that all the way through the grades 
the child is chiefly making acquaintances. This, of

  104 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
course, is most obviously and most thoroughly true 
at the beginning. It is your business, as his teacher, 
to introduce him to men and women, to facts, to 
situations, to scenes of beauty and truth and power, 
and to help him gather great stores of materials with 
which he may build through all the following years. 
If you appreciate this great fact you will necessarily 
see that to him, at first, nearly everything is new and 
strange. Not to see this, or not to regard it, may 
mean your failure as a teacher. One of your prob- 
lems, then, is to avoid identical and needless repeti- 
tion from year to year, yet at the same time to en- 
able the pupil to view the common field from many 
points of vantage. 
The materials and opportunities at your hand are 
many, but the motive that pushes you to success is 
one: it is love for your work — enthusiasm, if you 
please. The triumphs of history have derived more 
from the enthusiasm of leaders than from any other 
human force. The teaching of history, with children 
at least, depends more upon the enthusiasm of the 
teacher than upon any other factor. 
Finally, keep continually before you the human 
element in history — the moral values. Men and 
women have made it; it has been made for men and 
women; it points to the origins and the issues of 
life. You must make it a force for character and 
good citizenship. You are under a constant obli- 
gation to make the history course for the grades use-

ful for life to those pupils who never go beyond the 
grades, and at the same time so vital and thorough- 
going that it will serve as a good foundation for any 
and all subsequent study to those who continue in 
school.

  CHAPTER IX 
HISTORY IN THE AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL 
Becauvsz of its general values for good citizenship, 
we claim a respectable place in the high school for 
the study of history ; and because the citizenship we 
contemplate is to be exercised in a particular country 
—our own country—we seek in this study of history 
the particular character and values that seem to 
promise most for the making of citizenship in the 
United States of America. 
For many generations the human interest of his- 
tory has been acknowledged in many lands. In 
recent years it has gained fuller appreciation in the 
great awakening regarding the necessity for a more 
serious and a more general study of all social sciences ; 
yet, strange to say, in only a few of our high schools — 
“ the colleges of the people ’’ — even at this late day, 
has anything like adequate provision been made for 
history-teaching and history-study. In the great 
majority of American high schools the history courses 
are too short, too irregular, too poorly taught, and 
too lightly regarded.!. In many of our high schools,

1914, entitled ‘‘History in the High School Curriculum,” by 
St. George L. Sioussat. 
106 
‘
-P-A-G-E-119
  
HISTORY IN THE AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL 107 
and in some of quite respectable standing, no course 
whatever in American history is provided. This is 
certainly too bad. 
Let us study about other worlds, in which perhaps 
nobody lives, if we have time; but by all means let 
us study about our own world, and the people in it, 
since it is here that we must live and do our life work. 
Let us learn, if we have the opportunity (and, inci- 
dentally, the brains), how to draw, determine, and 
calculate all sorts of possible curves, seen and unseen, 
in space and in infinity; but, in all conscience, let 
us perceive it as our duty to get some notion of the 
sort of curve a normal human life should follow, in a 
normal human society. If schools are intended as a 
preparation for subsequent life, it seems reasonable 
to demand that we have taught in our schools the 
subjects that unfold life in the truest possible colors. 
All subjects of study, doubtless, have something in 
them of vital interest ; but, obviously, if we are seek- 
ing those that deal with human character, human 
conduct, and human destiny most directly we cannot 
neglect such subjects as history, literature, civics, and 
sociology. 
If we decide that history is of sufficient importance 
to merit a place in our high school courses, the next 
question is, What history shall we choose to put into 
these courses? 
Inasmuch as a majority of the pupils in our 
elementary schools never get into high school, or 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
108 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
  never complete high school, it would appear that the 
history taught in the grades should aim primarily 
at helping the pupil to be a man or a woman, and 
only secondarily at articulation with high school 
courses. Likewise, inasmuch as a large majority of 
the pupils in our high schools never go to college, it 
seems right that the history taught in the high 
schools should aim primarily at moral worth and 
social efficiency, and only secondarily at articulation 
with college courses. Nevertheless, a good history 
course for life values ought to be a good course for 
college entrance, and vice versa. Moreover, in the 
better class of high schools it will generally be possible 
to offer some range of election, so that the pupil 
preparing for college may conform agreeably with 
the college standards, and the one preparing more 
directly for home and office and shop and farm may 
study what seems best for him. 
In any case and in every case it would certainly 
not be amiss for the young American in high school 
to study American history and government at least 
one year. If he have but one year in high school, 
one of the subjects of study for that year should aim 
at enlarging his knowledge of his own country and at 
clarifying his sense of what a citizen of that country 
ought todo and be. Upon these premises the foliow- 
ing scheme is submitted: —

It is hardly necessary to remark that four years 
of work in history seems the desirable thing for the
-P-A-G-E-122
110 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
good American high school, and for the good Ameri- 
can citizen, in so far as he is or may be a high school 
product. It is confidently believed that such a 
four-year course as the one outlined above, which is 
approved by good authority! and wide acceptance, 
as well as by sound reason, will be found most profit- 
able for practical life values to the average student, 
and also acceptable to the average college as a prep- 
aration for the more intensive work of higher educa- 
tion. The shorter courses are not recommended in 
preference or even in competition, but only as expe- 
dients to be utilized in case the four-year course seems 
altogether out of reach. 
In his high school history work the student should 
of course make due progress beyond the standards 
and methods of the grades, but should not be 
required to jump any great chasms suddenly, to 
ape the habits of college and university. Many 
students in attempting to pass from the last grade 
into the first year of the high school are confused and 
discouraged upon encountering differences much 
greater than ought to exist. Naturally and properly 
the work of September in the high school is more 
advanced than that of the preceding June in the last 
grade, but there seems to be no adequate reason why 
three months of holiday here may warrant a much 
1See Report of the Committee of Seven to the American 
Historical Association, pp. 34,35. More extended reference to 
this Report will be found in Chapter XXIX. 
   
-P-A-G-E-123
HISTORY IN THE AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL 111 
greater advance than a similar period of equal length 
the preceding year. 
But having crossed the Rubicon, or whatever it is, 
and having entered upon the high school course, 
happily or unhappily, the student must give evidence 
of growth. He must be able to work more inde- 
pendently, though not less regularly and systemati- 
cally. He must develop the capacity for doing more 
work in a given time: for mastering longer assign- 
ments in the text, and for assembling more supple- 
mentary facts and materials from other sources. 
He should find increasing pleasure and facility in the 
use of source books, and after a year or two should 
have some degree of acquaintance with most of the 
history books in the school library. He should 
come to appreciate more keenly the values of history, 
and his interest in the subject should become in- 
creasingly intelligent and vital. 
In high school the fervid patriotism of the grades 
should not be cooled, exactly, but refined, and 
rendered more sane and safe. The youth of fifteen 
ought not to be allowed to pose as a critic, yet he 
may certainly be permitted to learn that all questions 
have two sides — even the questions that were raised 
by the American Revolution; that even aliens and 
enemies have rights; that one purpose of historical 
study is to cultivate the virtues of charity and jus- 
tice; and that the real student of history is seeking 
the whole truth rather than arguments that seem to 
   
-P-A-G-E-124
112. HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
support his favorite set of opinions. He should come 
to understand that an appropriate Fourth of July 
celebration may be had without either noise or 
smoke; that firecrackers are, after all, capable of 
expressing a very limited circle of sentiments; that 
men and women of peace may be just as loyal and 
helpful citizens and patriots as those who haste to 
war; and that the men who are charged with the 
heavy responsibilities of national policy and national 
destiny are as likely to be sincere and right as an 
irresponsible, chinkapin press. 
In the high school an increasing number of topical 
studies may be undertaken with interest and profit. 
Reports should be given, sometimes orally, some- 
times in writing; but in every case the form of the 
report as well as the substance of it should receive 
careful attention. The study of biography should 
still be carried on, old acquaintances being discovered 
in new relations, and new characters being intro- 
duced. The values of biographical studies will come 
into fuller appreciation as the student goes on from 
year to year. 
If the youth in high school is so fortunate as to 
have four years in history, according to the approved 
scheme outlined above, he will come in his senior 
year to the history of his own country again, better 
prepared than ever before to understand it and to 
appreciate it. During the three years in which he 
has been studying ancient, medieval, and modern
-P-A-G-E-125
  HISTORY IN THE AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL 113 
history he has been carrying with him the facts 
learned in the grades about American history, 
together with the notions he has formed upon the 
basis of those facts. As other countries, other ages, 
and other facts have come into his range of knowledge 
his notions about his own country have changed 
somewhat, and even the facts he learned as a boy 
grow larger and more significant as one stream of 
light after another falls upon them from Greece or 
Rome, from Paris or London. Accordingly, when 
he comes again, after long training and with enlarged 
vision, to review the history and governmental pro- 
cesses in the United States they will have many new 
meanings for him, and he will be able to see many 
new reasons for existing institutions here, because 
he has become familiar with many old origins else- 
where.! 
1In connection with the subject of this chapter attention 
is called to two articles in the History Teacher’s Magazine, June,

by N. M. Trenholme; and ‘‘Present Tendencies in High School 
History Teaching,” by T. P. Marshall. In the University of 
Virginia Alumni Bulletin, July, 1908, is an interesting paper by 
R. H. Dabney, entitled ‘‘ History in the High School.”

  CHAPTER X 
HISTORY IN THE AMERICAN NORMAL SCHOOL 
Ovr normal schools have been charged with 
superficiality in the teaching of the facts of history, — 
perhaps in the teaching of subject matter generally. 
History, however, is one of the subjects the facts 
of which seem to be specially elusive. In state 
examinations for teachers and in college examina- 
tions for entering students the marks on history are 
so generally poor as to be painfully conspicuous. 
Evidently there is somehow a frequent failure, in 
many parts of the United States, in the attempt to 
teach the facts of history. Are the normal schools 
altogether to blame? Is it true that the normal 
schools fail in their part of the business? What is 
their part? and what is the truth of the matter? 
I believe it is true that our normal schools often 
do not teach the facts of history very thoroughly. 
May I be pardoned for saying that this is not the 
primary business of the normal schools? The pri- 
mary function of the normal school is to give pro- 
fessional training. It is the business of the elemen- 
tary and secondary schools, among other things, 
thoroughly to fix the facts — the subject matter — 
114
-P-A-G-E-127
  HISTORY IN AMERICAN NORMAL SCHOOL 115 
up to a reasonable degree. The full graduate of a 
high school should know enough to enter college 
or to undertake professional courses in a normal 
school. But sometimes high school graduates do 
not know the subjects enumerated on their certifi- 
cates; and sometimes a state is so poorly provided 
with high schools that the normal schools must take 
pupils who have had less than four years of high 
school work. It is easy to see, therefore, how the 
charge of superficiality falls upon the normal schools. 
But it is just as easy to see that they are being cen- 
sured for what is really somebody else’s sin. 
The normal schools are properly professional 
schools, and should deal with every subject from the 
professional standpoint. Teaching facts, subject 
matter, as such, is not properly their business. It 
would be poor economy for them to do what can be 
done with less expense in the lower schools. More- 
over, if the normal school should undertake to keep 
students long enough to do its own work and the work 
of the high school too, there would be a great outcry 
against the long time-requirement. The normal 
school hardly dares to ask a four-year high school 
graduate to work more than two or three years for a 
teaching diploma; and a period of two or three 
years is not long enough for teaching subject matter 
thoroughly and for giving good professional training. 
It is not long enough for the latter alone if the former 
has not been done.
-P-A-G-E-128
116 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
But there is a way in which the normal school may 
become guilty, and make the charge against itself 
true and just: By admitting students with in- 
adequate preparation, or by granting diplomas to 
those who do not know and cannot do. Those who 
do not know are superficial; and those who cannot 
do will leave their pupils superficial. Under such 
conditions the normal school is in a measure respon- 
sible and culpable. 
To protect themselves against tasks that do not 
properly belong to them, to escape being charged 
with a superficiality for which other schools are justly 
responsible, and to secure a fair chance to do their 
proper work in a satisfactory manner, our normal 
schools must insist that students entering their gates 
really know the subject matter, the facts, that the 
elementary and secondary schools should teach 
them. For, be it clearly understood, the normal 
schools cannot in any way stand for superficiality, 
either in themselves or in other schools for which they 
are in some measure responsible. They must see 
to it that those persons who receive their diplomas 
to teach have adequate knowledge of facts as well 
as approved professional skill. If it is not the real 
business of the normal schools to teach subject 
matter, as such, it is their business to send good 
teachers to the lower schools and then to demand that 
those schools do their duty. Only when the pre- 
paratory schools do their work thoroughly can the
-P-A-G-E-129
HISTORY IN AMERICAN NORMAL SCHOOL 117 
normal schools do their proper work in the time 
allotted them. 
We should take pleasure in the fact, however, that 
the normal schools in doing their proper work have 
many opportunities for supplementing and strength- 
ening the work of the lower (or preceding) schools ; 
and as far as possible these opportunities should 
be utilized. It is a wise provision in the order of 
things that the matter of the various subjects is the 
logical material to use in teaching how to teach those 
subjects. Method depends on matter. The mind 
cannot go through a process of reasoning without 
ideas and notions out of which to construct the chain. 
A man cannot speak in approved manner without 
words. Likewise, in teaching principles and methods 
of instruction a concrete relation must be maintained. 
In giving professional training, materials of some 
appropriate kind must be used as a working basis, 
if the process is to be intelligible and usable. 
Obviously, the facts and materials making up the 
subject matter of the respective sciences and arts 
are the natural and proper objects in which to 
embody the processes of the teacher’s art. How to 
teach arithmetic is best shown in skillfully dealing 
with representative problems of arithmetic. How 
to teach botany is best shown by the scientific col- 
lection, study, and description of numerous plants. 
How to teach literature is best shown in the sym- 
pathetic and appreciative interpretation of some 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
118 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
literary masterpiece. And how to teach history is 
best shown by actually dealing with the facts, move- 
ments, and persons that have made history. 
If, therefore, the normal school teacher should 
proceed at once to instruct his class in the most 
approved methods of teaching history to children, 
he would incidentally, if he did his work well, teach 
more or less history to his pupils. It would probably 
be better still, for his purposes, to take a month or 
two — a whole quarter if available — for reviewing 
or new-viewing the subject as such, so as to gather 
the working materials well into hand. 
Such preliminary study of the subject, and all 
subsequent incidental study, should present new 
views rather than mere reviews. The normal school 
teacher of history should be able to reveal more in 
history than the average high school teacher; and 
the student preparing to teach should be expected 
to have keener and more appreciative discernment 
than the average student in the lower schools. Far 
from being superficial, the presentation of facts, 
although employed incidentally, should give a more 
profound insight and a juster sense of values than 
could reasonably be expected in the earlier stages of 
the student’s progress. In so far, therefore, as the 
facts, forces, and institutions of history are studied 
in the normal school, the work should be compre- 
hensive rather than extensive, philosophical rather 
than statistical; the aim should be toward a helpful
-P-A-G-E-131
  HISTORY IN AMERICAN NORMAL SCHOOL 119 
interpretation and application of facts rather than 
toward a mere catechising process to fix the facts. 
Such a process is out of place in a normal school. 
Discussion should be encouraged, opinions should 
be elicited, and a good deal of stress should be laid 
upon the proper correlation of history with kindred 
subjects, such as literature, geography, civics, 
sociology, and upon the opportunities for making 
it concrete through handwork of various sorts. The 
student should do much work in the library, not only 
for the purpose of collecting materials for reports, 
essays, teaching plans, and supplementary study, 
but also, and especially, for the purpose of getting 
acquainted with books. This last-mentioned pro- 
cess is deemed so important that a later chapter 
(Chapter XXIX) is devoted specially to it. 
Every normal school lesson in history, or in any 
other subject, if you please, whether given in the 
form of a lecture, a recitation, a series of questions 
and answers, a story, or a written quiz, should be an 
observation lesson. This statement is not to be 
construed as meaning that special observation lessons 
in the training school are not desirable or necessary, 
but as meaning simply that every time teacher and 
pupils come together both should have open eyes. 
The teacher should observe his pupils, collectively, 
of course, and individually, as far as possible. It is 
in this way that the teacher who wishes to learn may 
learn some of his best lessons. On the other hand,
-P-A-G-E-132
120 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
his pupils should be able to learn as much from what 
they see him do as from what he tells them to do. 
In his own attitude and procedure before his class he 
should demonstrate at least some of the principles 
and methods he lectures upon with so much com- 
placency and learning. The average pupil watches 
his teacher. The normal school student should make 
a specialty of watching his teacher. Not that nor- 
mal school teachers are perfect, or can be perfect ; 
but they ought to be, certainly, good enough to be 
watched with some profit to the pupil. A teacher, 
particularly a normal school teacher, who is not 
willing to be watched, not cynically but earnestly 
and sympathetically, had better resign. He is 
there to be watched. The intelligent student of 
normal school age is able to get theories and plans out 
of books, but he needs to observe teachers to see 
how they do things. 
The next step, of course, is for the student to do 
things himself. Accordingly, the normal school 
teacher should make it a point of conscience to have 
his pupils do things under his direction. He should 
have them stand before the class. Walking up to 
the front and standing there show character and 
habit. But further acts are necessary. Let the 
student speak. Let her tell a story; let her present 
oral and written reports; let her quiz the class 
occasionally; let her choose subjects for lesson 
plans, adapting her choices to this or that particular 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
  HISTORY IN AMERICAN NORMAL SCHOOL 121 
grade; let her do all the different things, as far as 
possible, that she will be called upon to do when she 
goes out to teach history upon her own responsibility. 
It is what the normal school student does, rather 
than what she says or writes, that enables the teacher 
to judge of her degree of teaching power. It occa- 
sionally happens that a student who knows facts, 
who thinks clearly, who gets all A’s on notebooks 
and examinations, is weak and almost a failure when 
up before a class trying to teach. On the other hand, 
it once in a while turns out that one who has had a 
hard time to make passing marks on paper shows an 
unexpected and surprising power on the floor. 
The scholar whose bodily presence is weak has a 
good chance for growth in personality, and she may 
in time become a dynamic teacher; but so far as 
her all-round rank in a normal school class goes her 
paper grades must go down somewhat to make an 
equitable adjustment with her deficient floor powers. 
Again, in due equity, the low paper grades of the one 
who is deficient in scholarship may be raised some- 
what in the general estimate if she have pedagogical 
tact and personal force, powers that are of primary 
importance in the teacher. 
If three quarters, or terms, can be had for the 
normal school course in United States history, it 
seems to me that a distribution of emphasis like the 
following might be best. In the first quarter put 
the emphasis upon subject matter, reviewing and
-P-A-G-E-134
122 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
new-viewing. In the second quarter let the teacher 
present chiefly principles and methods, ways and 
means of teaching the subject, giving demonstrations 
and illustrations of these methods, and so on, in 
ample measure. In the third quarter let the pupil 
show what she can do in the actual use of the various 
facts and methods learned or reviewed the preced- 
ing quarters. 
As far as practicable, the history courses in our 
normal schools should be shaped toward particular 
fields. That is, the work done in the normal school 
should contemplate this or that definite work or 
definite field for each normal school graduate. 
In other words, each normal school teacher of history 
should have, in each one of his classes, a definite 
notion as to whether he is training teachers for the 
high school or for the grades. Although the general 
principles of history and of teaching history are true 
and applicable everywhere, the training in methods, 
in ways and means, should take a rather special 
character, looking toward, say, the needs of primary 
classes, intermediate classes, grammar grades, or 
high school. 
Frequently college graduates are sought after to 
be teachers of history and other subjects in high 
schools. In many cases they prove to be very poor 
teachers. Two or three reasons are obvious. In 
the first place, most of them have had no special 
training to teach anything. In the second place,
-P-A-G-E-135
HISTORY IN AMERICAN NORMAL SCHOOL 123 
some of them never expect to be professional teachers, 
and hence are little concerned whether they are good 
teachers or not. And, in the third place, about all 
the methods they can think of are the methods they 
have seen used in college, and these do not fit the 
high school. 
Doubtless it would seem unkind to say that some 
very profound college and university professors are, 
as teachers, neither scientific nor dynamic; but it is 
nevertheless true. This fact must also be credited 
with some significance in enumerating the reasons 
why college graduates are sometimes poor teachers. 
Now, nothing herein is to be construed as meaning 
that a high school teacher of history, or of anything 
else, does not need college education. He does need 
it, and he should have it ; but before he goes into the 
schoolroom to teach he should also have professional 
training, aimed definitely at making him a good 
teacher. Frequently, perhaps in most cases, a four- 
year high school graduate, with two or three years 
in a normal school, will make a better teacher for the 
high school, or any other school, than the college 
graduate without any professional training. The 
better way will be happily found when the young 
man or young woman who intends to be a teacher 
will first graduate from the high school, then from 
the college, and then from the normal school. It is 
hardly necessary to say that a college graduate ought 
to get twice as much benefit from his normal school  
-P-A-G-E-136
  124 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
course as the one who comes in straight from high 
school. 
History in our normal schools should be taught in 
a highly sane and judicial spirit. The teachers of 
American youth must have not only a keen historical 
instinct, but also a true historical judgment. En- 
thusiasm is to be kindled to a white heat, but it 
must be safeguarded by fine self-control and a 
religious loyalty to truth. If we prize such qualities 
and powers in the teachers of our youth, we must 
demand them in the makers of teachers. 
Our normal schools must help to develop a just 
appreciation of subjective values in history study, 
along with a due insistence upon objective values. 
History, if well taught or earnestly studied, is certain 
to take hold upon the student’s life, interests, desires, 
ideals, and ambitions. These are subjective values. 
They are worth more than any mere knowledge of 
facts without effects. The teacher of the future will 
give more consideration to what the pupil is becoming 
in himself, and will not make him stand or fall upon 
a trick of memory. 
The normal school teacher of history may certainly 
be allowed to use any method for presenting facts 
that he may choose, just so he chooses well in every 
case. He may lecture; he may assign regular lessons 
in textbooks, and quiz upon them; he may require 
oral or written reports upon particular topics; he 
may occasionally have each pupil make a rather 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
  HISTORY IN AMERICAN NORMAL SCHOOL 125 
exhaustive study of some character or subject, and 
embody the results in a dissertation; but in every 
process he should aim at developing as much as 
possible the student’s own self-directing powers 
and his sense of responsibility. Those who are soon 
to go out to direct others should learn, as good 
stewards of life, how to control themselves, how to use 
their time, and how to direct their own powers and 
activities.

  CHAPTER XI 
THE USE OF THE HISTORY STORY IN THE 
TEACHING OF HISTORY 
WITHIN recent years educators have come again to 
recognize the value of the story, particularly in his- 
tory and related subjects. I say ‘‘ again’; for of a 
truth the value of the story has been appreciated and 
utilized in education at many times in the past; and 
in all countries and all ages, whether in school or 
home, whether in prose or song, whether upon silent 
pages or speaking lips, the story has had power. 
By one of the fortunate accidents that so often 
redeem defective systems, a set of old history story 
books that were published in the early part of last 
century fell into my hands as soon as I began to read. 
They were entitled The Child’s First Book of History, 
The Child’s Second Book of History, and The Child’s 
Third Book of History. It was accident, indeed, 
rather than plan that laid these books before me, 
but the accident worked better than many plans do. 
I looked at the pictures, I devoured the stories, I 
got a hunger for history. The same facts clad in 
the sober garb of philosophy might have repelled 
or even disgusted me; in the simple narrative they 
charmed me. 
1
-P-A-G-E-139
        THE HISTORY STORY 127 
Since the day, so long ago, when those books were 
published, there has been frequent dearth of history 
stories for home and school; but now it is not so. 
History stories — all sorts of stories — abound. Our 
task now is to sift the wheat from the chaff. 
Every child loves a story, just as every race in its 
childhood has loved a story. The poet in the Greek 
camps about Troy, the troubadour in the pleasant 
land of France, the minstrel in the Saxon halls, the 
ballad singer of the wild border, never wanted an 
audience ; for whether he chanted or whether he sang, 
whether he lilted in the measure of verse or dropped 
quaintly into prose, the people listened eagerly, for 
he told a story. 
He who gets the ear of a child will soon touch his 
heart. Securing and holding attention is one of the 
teacher’s hardest problems, but the story is one of 
the easiest and happiest solutions. Moreover, the 
story is valuable for economy. Professor Hinsdale 
well says : — 
“A bit of romance, poetry, anecdote, or story will 
often throw more light upon a historical situation, or let 
you deeper into a man’s heart and life, than a page of 
careful analysis. The story of Alfred and the cakes, of 
Bruce and the spider, of Sidney and the cup of water, 
of Marion and the sweet potatoes, are not only thoroughly 
characteristic, but they tell us more than a laborious 
description.” ! 
1 Hinsdale: ‘‘How to Study and Teach History,” p. 48.
-P-A-G-E-140
  128 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
History in general is rich in story material, because 
persons, action, events, achievement, make up so 
much of history ; and persons in action, participating 
in events and shaping achievement, appear as the 
controlling factors in every story. American history 
in particular is especially fortunate in a wealth of 
story. It is so, first, because of the innumerable 
splendid achievements that have marked our life 
from the early beginnings unto the present ; second, 
because of the rapidity with which the action has 
moved all along the line of our marvelous progress ; 
third, because of the high nobility of character that 
has in nearly every case distinguished our great men 
and women; and, finally, because the stories of 
American history are true stories. 
We assume that no argument is necessary to sus- 
tain the contention that a history story should be 
true. It should at least be true to the common 
life of a time, if not actually true in every name and 
incident. The stories of old Rome and of old 
England are beautiful, many of them, and have great 
value; but how much better for history would it be 
— perhaps for poetry too — if we could say of Romu- 
lus and King Arthur, ‘‘ They were not only real men, 
but they were just as they are pictured, and they 
did just the things with which they are credited.” 
We can say this of Columbus and William Penn and 
George Washington and Lafayette. America has 
its far-off age of shadows, to be sure, when dim, 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
THE HISTORY STORY 129 
uncertain figures moved behind the edge of dawn, 
but so far as our direct ancestors are concerned they 
came upon the New World stage in a full light, and 
the curtain has been lifted high ever since. The 
difference between our early American history and 
the early age of almost every other great country is 
the simple difference between history and myth, 
fact and fancy. It is worth much when we can tell 
the American boy a stirring story of his favorite hero, 
and say to him or let him feel “ It is true.” 
At present no teacher of American history need 
lack suitable books for guidance in history story work. 
As intimated in the opening sentence and elsewhere 
in this chapter, the value of history stories has come 
again into recognition, and all progressive publishers 
are making haste to put suitable collections of story 
books upon the market. They may be had now by 
the dozens, some for this grade, some for that, from 
first to last. However, one rather serious lack may 
still be noted: the lack of stories of women, great and 
good, who have helped to make our history. It 
is probable, however, that this lack will not exist 
much longer. 
Obviously, the largest proportion of story work 
falls naturally into the early grades. At first the 
teacher does nearly everything for the child: it is 
the story hour. At last the child is able to do nearly 
everything for himself: it is his day of strength. 
Accordingly, if one were to draw a diagram of this 
K
-P-A-G-E-142
130 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
transfer of power through the grades, he might use 
two of the dynamic marks of music: a long diminu- 
endo mark, with just above it a long crescendo. The 
first, beginning large and gradually lessening, would 
represent the story work of the teacher ; the second, 
beginning small and gradually expanding, would 
represent what the child grows into and acquires, 
making him more and more independent of what the 
teacher gives and does. 
Notwithstanding the fact that the teacher may 
find many excellent collections of history stories ready 
for her use, she must still exercise her own good judg- 
ment in the selection of the particular stories that 
she uses. A story for little children should be simple 
in plot, and not too long. The characters should be 
few and well marked. The whole story should be 
full of human interest and alive with action. 
Every story, for small children or larger ones, 
should be rich in detail — the little particulars about 
which the child will wonder if they are omitted. 
Broad generalities may glitter and sometimes thrill, 
but it is the realistic touch of a little hand, the shape 
and color of a hero’s cap, the exact words that a 
mother spoke that chain attention and grip the heart. 
The story-teller must train herself in the skillful and 
accurate picturing of detail in action, form, color, 
word, and feeling. 
To secure unity in a story it should be limited to a 
single incident, or should have a progressive conti- 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
THE HISTORY STORY 131 
nuity thav seads clearly and strongly from one incident 
to another. If possible, it should reach a climax at or 
near the end. The climax may involve a surprise 
or may relieve a suspense that has been built up grad- 
ually. The element of suspense is valuable in ex- 
citing interest and holding attention. It should be 
utilized in some way: by withholding a name, by 
creating a dangerous or trying situation, by arousing 
a desire for an explanation which is not at once 
given, or by asking a question which the story is to 
answer. The story-teller must be on her guard 
against giving away all the points of interest at the 
beginning. 
Probably the average story for the child should be 
a hero story; but the good teacher will likely take 
Vergil’s theme and cut it half in two. ‘Arma 
virumque cano”’ is too much for our better time: 
“ Virum cano”’ is enough. Children like the rattle 
of arms and the scramble of the fight, but we are 
now trying to train them for better things. Not 
that we can or ought to pluck out the fighting in- 
stinct, but we should give it proper aims and objects. 
As long as the world is full of dangers and life is full 
of struggles, we need the grit to fight and the grace 
to die; but both are “in viro”’ and neither is “ in 
armis.”’ We have come now to seek the heroism that 
gives life and saves life, rather than the sort that 
takes life or hurts life. We have risen to the plane 
of law and justice, at least in our aims, and widened
-P-A-G-E-144
  132 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
our love of heroism so as to include ‘“ the brave at 
home.” 
Here is a little story of a sort that may be given 
to children in the second or third grade. 
ExnizaBeta Irvine’s Rive 
You perhaps have heard of the ride of Paul Revere, 
from Boston to Lexington, one night in April more than 
a hundred years ago. Now I am going to tell you about 
the ride of Elizabeth Irvine. She lived long ago too, 
about the same time that Paul Revere lived; but his 
home was in Massachusetts, and hers was in Virginia. 
Paul Revere’s ride was made one night, as I said. 
Elizabeth Irvine’s ride was also made one night. But 
there were some differences, too. Paul Revere’s ride was 
in the spring of the year, in April; Elizabeth Irvine’s 
ride was in the fall, in October or November. And she 
rode twice as far as Paul Revere did. He rode twelve 
or fifteen miles, while she rode about thirty. 
As I told you, Elizabeth Irvine lived in Virginia. Her 
home was in the beautiful Shenandoah Valley, on a little 
stream called Long Glade. Near by was a little village 
called Dinkletown. The big county of Augusta then 
included Dinkletown, the Long Glade section, and much 
of the country round about. 
Elizabeth Irvine, at the time of which I speak, was a 
young woman, just recently married. She was not very 
tall, and had bright black eyes. Her husband’s name was 
Francis Irvine. 
One day, as autumn came on, Francis Irvine and all 
the other men on Long Glade and at Dinkletown started
-P-A-G-E-145
THE HISTORY STORY 133 
on a hunting trip. They needed a supply of venison and 
other meat for the winter, and expected to be away from 
home a week or two. 
The men left early in the morning, and the day was long 
and lonesome for young Mrs. Irvine; but about four 
o’clock in the afternoon she had a visitor. Who do you 
think it was? I know you could never guess. It was 
an old Indian woman called Shawnee Kate. 
Kate was an old friend of Mrs. Irvine’s, but her visit 
was a great surprise. 
“Why Kate!” exclaimed Mrs. Irvine, “I haven’t 
seen you for a long time, and I thought you were away out 
on the South Branch with your people.” 
Then the old woman told Mrs. Irvine something that 
made her start and give a little cry. 
“Kill-Buck makes ready to get all the scalps at Deer- 
field. I come to tell you.” 
Deerfield was Mrs. Irvine’s old home. Her parents and 
brothers and sisters lived there. They were in great 
danger, for Kill-Buck was the most cunning and cruel 
chief in all the country between the Shenandoah and the 
Ohio. Shawnee Kate had walked many miles to warn 
Mrs. Irvine; for often the little black-eyed girl at Deer- 
field had given the old squaw a smile and something to eat. 
But ° was thirty miles to Deerfield, and all the men 
of Long Glade and Dinkletown were away hunting. 
Kill-Buck was gathering his braves for the attack. They 
were hiding in the great mountains west of the valley. 
It was a time for action, and Elizabeth Irvine did not 
hesitate. She had quick eyes and strong hands, and her 
heart did not fail. She saw the danger that hung over 
Deerfield; she also saw her own duty.
-P-A-G-E-146

134 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
Out in the pasture lot was a good horse. It was hers. 
Her father gave it to her the day she left her old home to 
come to her new home on Long Glade. She ran out to 
the lot and called : 
“Dundee ! Dundee! Come, Dundee!” 
The horse raised his head, set his ears forward, and came 
quickly to her side. In a few minutes he was bridled and 
a saddle was on his back. Mrs. Irvine mounted him and 
turned his head towards Deerfield. 
The whole country was in forest, and the trails were 
rough and hard to find at many places. It was dark 
before she passed the headwaters of the Glade. It was 
midnight before she reached Buffalo Gap, the first moun- 
tain pass. Because of the darkness and the bad road she 
had to go slowly. Rocks and stumps were in the way, 
bushes swept the horse’s sides, and rough branches of 
trees hung low overhead. If the horse had not known the 
way better than his rider, both would have been hopelessly 
lost. 
Do you think Mrs. Irvine was afraid? Yes, she was 
afraid. And that proves her a brave woman. She rode 
right on through the darkness, even though she was afraid. 
She was used to the hooting of the owls; and I do not 
think she minded much the howling of the wolves; but 
she did shiver a little when she saw a tall stump that 
looked like an Indian. She did not know how soon one 
of Kill-Buck’s warriors might step out into the narrow 
path and clutch Dundee by the bridle. She thought 
that some of them might be on the watch. 
Mrs. Irvine had a wonderful memory. Late in life 
she could recite Milton’s Paradise Lost and Young’s Night 
Thoughts. But she must have had many thoughts of her
-P-A-G-E-147
  THE HISTORY STORY 135 
own that night. I doubt whether she recited poems that 
night, unless it was some of King David’s. She was a 
Scotch-Irish Presbyterian, and knew her Bible by heart 
too. She may have gone over some words like these :— 
“In thee, O Lord, do I put my trust; . . . for thou art 
my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name’s sake 
lead me, and guide me. Pull me out of the net that they 
have laid secretly for me: for thou art my strength.” 
It takes a long time to ride thirty miles, even on a good 
road in the daytime. Over that rough trail, in the dark 
night, it took Mrs. Irvine hours and hours. As I told you, 
it was midnight before she reached Buffalo Gap. Deer- 
field was still eight or ten miles further on. 
After a couple of hours more Dundee went down a steep 
bank and Mrs. Irvine heard his feet splash in water. She 
was pretty certain that it was the Calf Pasture River. 
Some distance ahead she could see the dim outline of a 
high mountain against the sky. It was the first great 
“ange of the Alleghanies, and she knew that she was close 
to Deerfield. As the morning star came up over the Blue 
Ridge, far in the east, she rode up to her father’s door. 
The settlement was saved. 
Elizabeth Irvine lived to tell her grandchildren this 
story, and some of her descendants still live on Long 
Glade. If you wish to find Dinkletown on the map, just 
look for Bridgewater. That is the present name. 
For boys and girls of the fifth grade and upwards, 
who begin to understand the importance of science 
in history and especially in our present-day life, the 
following story and others like it might be used.

  Tue “ VoutrurNo” TRIUMPH 
Shortly after daybreak on the ninth of last October 
(1913) a great ocean steamer was bravely plowing her 
way eastward through the waves of a stormy sea. Sud- 
denly her course changed; her speed quickened. Like 
a frightened monster of the deep she heaved and plunged 
forward. Soon every rib of steel and close-locked joint 
in her giant body was trembling and throbbing under the 
strain of her mighty engines, far down in the burdened 
hold. 
What had happened? Why the changed course and 
the quickened speed? Why was the great ship leaping 
forward like a frightened thing of life, fleeing as from a 
terrible foe ? 
It was indeed a race for life — the life of passengers and 
crew; and the terrible foe that threatened death could 
not be left behind. It clung to the fleeing ship and was 
carried along in the race. The smoke that rose from the 
forward decks and mingled with that of the furnace stacks 
told the story: The ship was afire ! 
It was the good ship Volturno, with hundreds of men, 
women, and children aboard. Her young captain and 
his brave men were fighting the fire and driving the vessel 
forward in the hope of finding rescue. 
Far off on the stormy waters another great ship was 
suddenly changing her course, and leaping forward at 
increasing speed. The passengers perhaps wondered, but 
the reason soon became known. A miracle had called 
out of the skies. Out of the clouds a little voice had come, 
searching far and wide for a listening ear. Out over the 
rolling waves, up into the seething air, from height to
-P-A-G-E-149
  
THE HISTORY STORY 137 
height and from cloud to cloud it trembled on until at 
last it touched and thrilled a human soul. High on the 
second ship the operator of the wireless telegraph sat at 
his post, faithful and vigilant, the receiver at his ear; 
and he caught the little cry for help that came struggling 
through the clouds. 
As he listened he learned the thrilling import of the mes- 
sage: “We are afire— cannot stop it — come quick or 
650 lives will be lost.’ The location of the burning ship 
was also given; and then out into space, far across the 
leagues of sea, this heart-cheering answer flew: ‘“‘We are 
coming — forced draught — cheer up — we will take you 
off.” 
It was to make this promise good that the second ship 
changed her course and rushed forward at top speed ; but 
the distance to the Volturno was eighty miles; and from 
her forecastle was rising a column of flame forty feet high. 
Escape by the lifeboats of the ship was impossible in 
the savage seas. Some were lowered and filled with human 
cargoes, only to be swamped or dashed to pieces. A 
hundred lives were lost to prove that escape in boats was 
not to be hoped for. The horror of the situation was 
increased by several terrible explosions in the hold of the 
ship, which seemed enough to burst her steel-ribbed hull 
and open it to the hungry waters. In terror and with 
shortened breath the huddling groups on the decks 
watched the bow of the ship, expecting to see it settle 
down into the depths at any moment. The officers of 
the Volturno expected that she would burn to the water’s 
edge in an hour, but they did not speak of their fears 
to the passengers. Instead they distributed life preserv- 
ers and continued to fight the flames. Risking their lives
-P-A-G-E-150
  138 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
in deadly peril, they bore themselves as men, cheering the 
passengers with words of hope. 
It was early morning when the fire broke out. It was 
noon before the first rescue ship, the gallant Carmania, 
came up. The chance of rescue even then seemed hope- 
less, for the storm and the sea threatened death to all 
who sought escape from the flames. The shivering groups 
pressed toward the stern of the fated vessel, with imploring 
eyes fixed on the helpers so near, yet so powerless to give 
them aid. Hour after hour passed, and ship after ship 
came racing in over the rolling seas in answer to the little 
trembling call that had gone out upon the winds and 
clouds. Time and again through the terrible afternoon 
efforts were made to lower boats and reach the burning 
ship; but all in vain. Every boat was beaten back, 
though strong men did their best, risking their lives in 
every attempt. 
At half-past five in the evening the ship Kroonland came 
up. Her crew lowered boats, as others had done, but 
these too were dashed back. Night was approaching, 
and death seemed to frown from sky and sea. The 
pain of those who had failed to give help answered to the 
despair of those who were going slowly down with the 
burning ship. One who stood on the Kroonland’s deck 
and looked across the heaving valleys of death thus 
described the scene : — 
“We could see the passengers grouped at the stern of 
the Volturno. Their cries for help wrung our hearts. 
Women could be seen stretching out their arms to us and 
holding their babies for us to see. Their ship was blazing 
like a furnace forward of the funnel. Our boat was forced 
to return without reaching her.”
-P-A-G-E-151
  THE HISTORY STORY 139 
But the brave captain and crew of the Volturno still 
fought on and hoped for rescue. Shortly before dark 
Second Officer Edward Lloyd, stern-faced and resolute, 
with four other brave men, undertook to show the rescue 
fleet that a boat could be taken across the waves. They 
launched a lifeboat, and after a terrible struggle reached 
the Kroonland; but as they clambered up the Kroonland’s 
side their shattered boat sank. 
Through the long, black night the rescue ships circled 
near the center of fire, their searchlights piercing in hither 
and thither through the vales of shadow. Toward 
morning the seas began to subside. From the Narra- 
gansett, an oil steamer, great quantities of oil were pumped 
on the angry waters, and soon it became possible to reach 
the Volturno with less danger. At five o’clock the real 
work of transfer began, and at nine the task was done. 
For more than 24 hours the Volturno’s crew had fought 
the flames, and the terrified passengers had watched the 
fight. Ten rescue ships had come out of the dark horizons 
in answer to that thrilling call of the air, and had gathered 
in a rolling circle about the fated vessel. Storm and sea 
and fire raged through the long hours, but 521 out of 
657 on board the Volturno were saved. 
The young captain of the Volitwrno, having nobly led 
his men in the fight to a splendid finish, came finally up 
the Kroonland’s side. 
“One could not tell,” said a passenger who saw him, 
“whether he was a white man or a black man. His face 
was scorched and blackened by fire and smoke. His 
eyes were red and painful. His uniform was in tatters. 
His shoes had nearly been burned from his feet. His 
coolness and his gallantry were warmly commended by
-P-A-G-E-152
  140 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
his passengers and crew and by the people on the rescuing 
ships.” 
As he came aboard the Kroonland, last of all to leave the 
flaming Volturno, he carried with him his dog, which he 
had found on his last careful search. 
The young captain’s name is Francis Inch; and we 
feel like saying, “Every inch a man.” He and his men 
represent the modern chivalry, the heroism of the higher 
life. And along with their names let us link that of 
William Marconi, the man of science, whose thought 
has winged so many brave acts with power. The triumph 
of that terrible day on the sea was a triumph of modern 
science and modern manhood. 
To begin with, the teacher is the teller. To be a 
good story-teller, she must cultivate a style that is 
clear and easy, and somewhat picturesque or graphic. 
Her manner must be vivacious, and she must have 
feeling and imagination enough to enter into thestory 
with spirit. She must add the power of her eyes 
and face and attitude and tone of voice to the words 
she utters. Reading good stories and listening to good 
story-tellers will help her; but after all she must 
train herself in the art by careful, thoughtful practice. 
As aids in story-telling the teacher may use maps, 
pictures, relics, blackboard sketches, and music. 
A poem recited or a song sung may often add a 
touch of power to a story. The historic songs that 
are now accessible on talking-machine records have a 
decided value for the teacher of children.
-P-A-G-E-153
  
THE HISTORY STORY 141 
Finally, balance impression with expression. Have 
the child reproduce the story. This will help him 
in fixing and organizing the facts; it will give the 
teacher a chance to judge of her own work; and it 
will develop ease and skill in the child’s manner and 
speech. If the story is difficult, it may be told to 
the child several times ; but sooner or later he should 
be asked to repeat it.

CHAPTER XII 
HISTORY IN BIOGRAPHY 
From the history story it is an easy and natural 
step to biography. Most of the stories relate to 
history makers, introducing them in characteristic 
attitudes and significant incidents. Indeed, somany 
incidents in the life of a man like Washington may be 
given in stories in the first grades that a full-length 
picture of the man is constructed by the child, for 
himself, even before anything like a formal bio- 
graphical study is planned by the teacher. When a 
connected biographical study is begun the child is 
pleased to meet an old acquaintance; to find a logi- 
cal connection between the incidents of which he has 
already heard; to see reasons for certain actions he 
has long admired but perhaps never much under- 
stood; and to reconstruct his picture of the hero in 
the fuller light and according to the better standards. 
Biography fills a large place in history; and may 
we not say, especially in American history? The fact 
that, so far as the English, French, Germans, Dutch, 
Swedes, Scotch, and Irish are concerned, we have no 
prehistoric age in America makes our history begin 
with real biography, and not with myth and fable. 
143 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
  144 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
The fact that our state and national systems were 
worked out in fine form before our country was 
crowded with a dense population not only gave a 
few great men a chance to fashion great things, but 
also gives us a chance to see what those men were 
really doing. In older lands the clouds of uncer- 
tainty rest upon the face of history until the ages 
are far advanced, until many fundamental processes 
in politics, religion, literature, industry, and social 
institutions have been wrought out, and until the 
face of the earth is so full of men that we either 
cannot tell who are the masters of progress or despair 
of knowing them because of their multitude. 
In the United States it has been different. From 
the time our forefathers first came to the New World 
we have had a fair record of their doings; and be- 
cause they could begin here with an advanced degree 
of civilization it was possible for them to accomplish 
wonderful things in a few years, and before the num- 
ber of workers became an indistinguishable multi- 
tude. Consequently the biographies of a few great 
characters give us a grip on nearly all the significant 
and constructive forces in the making of what we call 
America. American history is rich in biography 
not only because of the splendid qualities that have 
generally distinguished our leading men and women, 
but also because of what it has been possible for a 
few men and women to accomplish. 
The child appreciates the maker of history before 
 
-P-A-G-E-157
  HISTORY IN BIOGRAPHY 145 
he understands the making or the meaning of history. 
Accordingly, it is possible to introduce the study of 
biography at an early stage in history teaching. Be- 
cause of the many sides of great human beings it is 
possible to continue the study of biography with 
profit in college and university. The child will study 
Washington with one sort of interest, the statesman 
with another; both with profit. 
In biography what we term human interest is 
strong and obvious. This will doubtless be acknowl- 
edged however we may define human interest, or 
even if we do not attempt to define it at all. Each 
person may make his own definition and still find the 
statement true. Theories often seem vague and far 
off. Things often appear to have no connection 
either among themselves or with us; thoughts are 
frequently bewildering ; but living, suffering, loving, 
conquering men and women come very near to us, 
and our hearts are soon beating sympathetically 
with theirs. 
Biography emphasizes the personal element in 
history. The personal element can hardly be over- 
valued. In truth, we are constantly in danger of 
not recognizing the personal forces in great move- 
ments at half their value. We speak of the course 
of events, as if things of themselves worked them- 
selves out in logical series. We abstract the spirit 
of the age, as if it were something that has an exist- 
ence apart from the embodied spirits that walk and 
L
-P-A-G-E-158
    146 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
talk before us. Evolution has become evident in 
so many things, persons, and institutions that we 
almost imagine evolution as a force in itself that 
comes and lays hold of us and makes us go a certain 
way, whether we will or no. Let us know that so 
far as human events are concerned they are shaped 
largely by personal character and personal conduct. 
When we extol public sentiment or the spirit of the 
age let us be thankful that a majority of the influ- 
ential people of the age have such controlling power 
through their agreement upon certain principles. 
It is very well to make the spirit of the age responsi- 
ble; but we must not fail to make the ruling majority 
responsible for the spirit of the age. It is a personal 
thing, and can have no existence apart from persons. 
Sometimes a great man represents the spirit of his 
age; sometimes he dies trying to change it. Evolu- 
tion may be observed in matter, but if so it was 
directed by intelligence, and intelligence can exist only 
in persons. Evolution may be evident in the life 
of a man, in his body, in his spirit; but in either 
case his own intelligence or that of another is respon- 
sible. Responsibility must always be forced back 
upon a person. Evolution in institutions is made 
possible only as people change. 
Whether we speak of science or art or law or litera- 
ture or invention or industry or agriculture or com- 
merce or education or religion, we speak always of 
things that depend on persons and that can have no
-P-A-G-E-159
  HISTORY IN BIOGRAPHY 147 
existence apart from persons. All intellectual forces, 
perhaps, and all moral forces certainly, are personal 
forces. Intellectual and moral forces have made 
much of the world’s history directly; much of the 
remainder they have made indirectly by their action 
upon material things. 
The power of personality in history becomes strik- 
ingly manifest when we behold a man like Luther or 
Napoleon or Peter the Great or John Wesley. Only 
a few persons, it may be, have such power; but 
nearly all great powers come from persons — from a 
single person acting supremely or from may persons 
acting in more or less harmony. 
In proportion as the student recognizes the per- 
sonal element in history, in proportion as he sees 
how social and political institutions are determined 
by the characters and conduct of men and women, 
he will be forced to acknowledge his personal obli- 
gation as a citizen. Upon such a basis education for 
efficient and honorable citizenship ought to be proper 
and easy. Is it fortitude and devotion and patience 
and justice and enterprise and patriotism that have 
made the past glorious? Is it these qualities that we 
cherish for the future? These things are found in 
persons: nowhere else can they be found. 
Biography makes history vital and concrete. It 
shows progress registered in human life, and physical , 
factors controlled and directed by human powers. 
The abstract notion of history as a system beyond
-P-A-G-E-160
  148 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
us or apart from us takes definite forms in the friends 
and foes about us and in the striving forces within us. 
It may be very difficult for a boy or girl to make a 
generalization from many facts concerning a particu- 
lar time; but either one can readily get acquainted 
with a man or woman that illustrates the time by 
being typical or representative. Graft and philan- 
thropy are vague, elusive terms; but Tweed and 
Peabody become living realities, chained in memory, 
walking in the full noon of imagination. 
All of us, children especially, are continually trans- 
ferring ourselves into other selves. It is only a trick 
of imagination, to be sure, but we all do it, and it may 
be done with profit. The boy sees himself an Indian, 
a policeman, Columbus, or Daniel Boone; the girl 
sees herself a fine lady, a missionary, Molly Pitcher, 
or Priscilla Alden. Biography presents many attrac- 
tive transfers to the imagination. Proper biography 
thus opens many desirable flights to aspiration, and 
at the same time closes many that are undesirable. 
The child’s imagination is going to make flights, 
we may be certain of that; the child is going to think 
himself somebody else much of the time. Shall he 
be introduced into the company of nobles, who have 
made the best the world has, or shall he be allowed to 
find heroes for himself in Deadwood Dick and the 
nearest gang leader? 
We prepare ourselves for action by observing what 
others do, and by picturing in thought what we would 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
  HISTORY IN BIOGRAPHY 149 
do in their places. It makes a great deal of differ- 
ence for life and citizenship where the boy goes when 
he jerks on the seven-league boots, as well as when 
he literally walks down town. The boy who habitu- 
ally sees himself John Hampden, or George Wash- 
ington, or Cyrus W. Field is getting ready to do 
his country real service; and the girl who thinks 
with burning heart what she would do in the crises 
that have always proved the nobility of woman- 
hood is growing fiber for humanity in all the ages 
to come. 
Biography makes historical classification easy and 
rapid. One of the great facts we need to learn in 
history as well as in natural science is that things, 
events, people, and institutions fall properly into 
classes, and that among the endless multitude and 
the infinite variety there are, after all, only a few 
great, determining groups. Men are easily classified 
as statesmen, scholars, soldiers, pioneers, inventors, 
and a child is able to make intelligent classifica- 
tions of men long before he is capable of assorting 
and labeling theories, acts, and institutions. More- 
over, upon the basis of the easy classifications in 
biography he is soon ableto reach out and comprehend 
men and women of corresponding classes in all ages 
and all lands. Having learned to know intimately 
a few pioneers, he will have a fair acquaintance with 
the life of all pioneers. Having studied at length a 
few statesmen, he will be able to appreciate the ordi-
-P-A-G-E-162
  150 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
nary experiences and problems of all statesmen. 
Biography, therefore, like the history story, has a 
decided economy value. 
The biography of a great historical character gives 
a natural and obvious continuity to contemporary 
events. The life of Daniel Boone leads one along 
the path of civilization from the older settlements 
out into the wilderness, and makes him a witness of 
the great movement of the people westward. The 
life of Franklin leads one along the shining way of 
scientific experiment, and at the same time chains 
together in a related series the steps and struggles 
of our national beginnings. Biography not only 
supplies the place of chronology, but it also makes 
evident many links in the chain of cause and effect. 
As testimony to the value of biography in history 
teaching, both for children and for acvanced stu- 
dents, we have many authoritative statements from 
Europe and America. Many of the best schools in 
both the Old World and the New World teach his- 
tory largely through a study of the history makers. 
The practice seems to be growing, and all the stand- 
ard publishing houses are making an effort to pro- 
vide suitable biographies of distinguished men. I 
say men advisedly; for as yet not much has been 
done to supply the need of appropriate biographies 
of great women. There is a need here, not only be- 
cause of the telling work women have done in the 
building of our civilization, but also because girls
-P-A-G-E-163
HISTORY IN BIOGRAPHY 151 
in our schools have a right to their inheritance in the 
noble characters and devoted service of their mothers 
and grandmothers.! 
1 In connection with the general subject of this chapter atten- 
tion is invited to ‘Some Social and Political Pioneers of the 
Nineteenth Century,” by Ramoden Balmforth; Swann, Son- 
nenschein & Co. The introduction to this book, dealing with 
biography and its relation to history, is finely apropos. 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
CHAPTER XIII 
DRAMATICS AS A METHOD OF TEACHING HISTORY 
Ture are three to whom drama is almost real life ; 
The child, the savage, and the artist. With the last, 
dramatic expression has been perfected by long 
training ; with the other two it is mainly an instinct, 
inherited through long ancestry. For our purposes 
we shall waive the interest that may attach to the 
savage and the artist, in order that we may give at- 
tention to the dramatic instincts of the child and the 
opportunity we have of teaching him history upon 
the basis of these instincts. 
Just as some nationalities, like the French and 
Spanish, for example, are more dramatic than others, 
so some children are more dramatic than others. 
This probably means, for one thing, that imagina- 
tion is more lively and vivid for some than for others. 
Nevertheless, every normal child has imagination 
and dramatic instinct enough to fill out many a 
historical incident if it is presented in action, and to 
portray many scenes and incidents of his own initia- 
tive if given any chance at all. 
All of us have observed how readily the little boy 
transforms an old broom into a horse, and himself 
152
-P-A-G-E-165
  
DRAMATICS 153 
into the expert rider of a plunging charger. I once 
started to dodge out of a path because I heard what 
I thought was a horse trotting up behind me. When 
I turned to look I saw a small colored boy coming on 
four feet, as it were, and imitating almost exactly 
in sound the horse-trot by holding in his hands two 
small tin boxes. He had the dramatic instinct, and 
was working it out in sound as well as in action. A 
little chap one day stuck his thumb into a cherry 
pudding ; when he drew it out and held it up the tip- 
top was red. “ That’s Santa Claus,’ he exclaimed, 
“in ared cap.” If Snug the Joiner has a good voice 
for roaring he does not need to hide half his face in 
alion’s mane: the child will see him a lion as quickly 
as Oberon, Titania, or Robin Goodfellow. <A feather 
will make an Indian, a tent in the back yard a wig- 
wam in the forest. A penny trumpet and a paper 
drum become a splendid military band instantly in 
the magic alchemy of the boy’s spirit. A dark corner 
is a bear’s den and the boy is a bear as he lunges out, 
growling fiercely. He cannot think about a soldier 
without straightening up and shouldering his imagi- 
nation for a gun if nothing better happens to be in 
his hand. 
Story and biography stir up the dramatic instinct, 
and call strongly upon the boy for action. As he 
goes with Washington across the Delaware he finds 
himself springing up in the bow of the boat and 
giving orders for clearing the way. As he stands 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
154 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
with Nelson upon the deck of the Victory he catches 
himself giving the famous charge, ‘‘ England expects 
every man to do his duty.”” As he walks by himself 
and lives over the life of his hero he breaks out into 
stirring speech, strikes an attitude, and works out a 
long, complex situation in a few simple words and 
motions. 
Since action is so much of the child’s life and makes 
such a tremendous appeal to him, the teacher cannot 
afford to neglect all the waiting opportunities in this 
great field. Since action appeals to the child, let him 
see action: let him see some of the characters, classes, 
and incidents of which he is told in visible, moving, 
talking forms. And, on the other hand, since the 
child is himself always potentially and often actually 
an actor, let him do things and be persons under the 
teacher’s guidance. 
History is full of characters, situations, and inci- 
dents that lend themselves to dramatic representa- 
tion. If any one doubts this let him recall the great- 
est operas and dramas of the greatest masters, and 
observe how many of them are historical. American 
history is especially fortunate here, because America 
has been preéminently the land of action, of swift 
and wondrous achievement. It has been said that 
America is poor in literary materials because of the 
homogeneity of its people and the sameness of its 
physical characteristics. It would be hard to find 
anything farther from the truth. There are cer-
-P-A-G-E-167
  DRAMATICS 155 
tainly obvious differences between New Orleans and 
Philadelphia; between San Francisco and Boston ; 
between the people of Charleston and the people of 
the Appalachian highlands; between the Scandi- 
navians of the Dakotas and the sombrero-wearers 
of the Mexican border. If we desire more striking 
differences, we may utilize the red men who claimed 
the land ahead of us and the negroes that have been 
brought in from Africa. If we want to see the classes 
of our nation in close contrast, all at one place, we 
might find them during a brief stay in Washington ; 
and if we desire to see the peoples of all the earth 
close enough together for interesting situations, we 
might find most of them in a tour about New York. 
For nationalities we have the French, the Dutch, 
the Swedes, the Germans, the Scotch, the Irish, the 
Spanish, the Welsh, the Italians, the Russians, the 
Syrians, the Greeks, the Japanese, the Chinese, and 
as many more as you wish. For social and industrial 
classes we have the farmers, the miners, the lumber- 
men, the fishermen, the ranchmen, the pioneers and 
hunters, the Puritans, the Cavaliers, the Quakers, 
the Jesuit missionaries, the frontier preachers, the 
Indian traders, the stage-drivers, the fire-fighters, 
the soldiers, the sailors, the trained nurses, the Sal- 
vation Army men and women, the Red Cross workers, 
the policemen, and the railroad men. All these 
classes would lend themselves easily to distinctive 
representation, because of their striking costumes,
-P-A-G-E-168
156 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
  their different tools, weapons, or equipment, and be- 
cause of the marked diversity in their several occu- 
pations. Not only would it be comparatively easy 
to represent any one of these classes in drama, but 
every one of them has played or is now playing an 
important part in American history. 
Striking historical characters — persons — may 
be made up just as easily, and with historical accuracy 
enough to be of real educational value. John Smith, 
Pocahontas, Miles Standish, John Alden, Priscilla, 
William Penn, Peter Stuyvesant, Sam Houston, 
Robert Fulton, Lafayette, Eli Whitney, Marcus 
Whitman, Ponce de Leon, Henry Hudson, Benjamin 
Franklin, and many others have enough distinctive 
characteristics and equipment associated with them 
to be recognized without great difficulty, even if they 
were not very well portrayed. 
For small children Indian life and the life of the 
white pioneers afford many appropriate subjects and 
incidents for dramatic reproduction. The “ Indian 
suits ’’ that have for some time been on the market 
for children make the matter of costumes a simple 
problem. For larger boys and girls inexpensive 
costumes and equipment may be improvised with 
little labor. Not long ago I witnessed a beautiful 
presentation of the ‘‘ Song of Hiawatha,” given by 
a number of young ladies. Their costumes were not 
expensive, and they certainly did not require much 
time for construction, for all who appeared in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-169
DRAMATICS 157 
drama were busy students and did not have much 
time for “ extras.” A stick and a string made the 
famous bow, terrible to the timid deer, necessary to 
the hunter, and useful to the poet for adjusting man 
and woman. Another stick served for an arrow. 
An ordinary electric light bulb, wrapped in red tissue 
paper and tucked into a pile of wood under a small 
kettle suspended from a tripod, gave a fine effect of 
fire. Brown autumn leaves on the floor, and branches 
from the forest in profusion in the corners and about 
the windows, produced a woodland scene of sufficient 
fullness and wildness. Dark tresses unbraided and 
fair faces daubed with some harmless paint, with a 
few rather loud ornaments donned for the occasion, 
fascinated the gaze of the spectator and helped his 
imagination to rush swiftly back across the years 
and deep into the primeval forests. The chanting, 
the singing, and the dancing completed the striking 
scene. 
Here are two specific suggestions. For giving a 
class or a school a good notion of the different nation- 
alities that have made up the United States, it is 
possible without much trouble or expense to have a 
pair of the larger pupils represent each. A boy and 
a girl may be costumed and otherwise equipped to 
be Puritan English ; another pair, Cavalier English ; 
a third pair, Quaker English. Other pairs may per- 
sonate the Dutch, the French, the Germans, and 
the Scotch. Similarly the various industrial classes
-P-A-G-E-170
158 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
may be portrayed. Costumes should belong to the 
school, and the equipment may then be kept from 
year to year. 
The second suggestion is this: Let various mem- 
bers of the class or the school personate famous men 
and women in history : Daniel Boone, Elizabeth Zane, 
John Smith, Pocahontas, Benjamin Franklin, Betsy 
Ross, andsoon. There is no harm in letting each boy 
or girl bear in school the name of the historical per- 
son represented. Then, to make the proceeding still 
more interesting and profitable, let each actor make 
a special study of the life and character of the person 
he stands for, — become a sort of authority concern- 
ing that person; and let all questions pertaining to 
the historical man or woman be referred to the boy 
or girl that personates that man or woman. 
Many good people dread the dramatic, and perhaps 
with very good reason. Nearly everything that has 
great possibilities for uplift has corresponding possi- 
bilities for degradation. The press and the ballot 
are other examples. Yet it hardly seems fair for the 
wrong party to be granted a monopoly of great powers 
by the voluntary withdrawal of the right party. 
There seems little more reason for teachers and 
others, who have the welfare of youth at heart, to 
surrender the drama to the vicious and mercenary 
than for them to surrender the ballot to the same 
classes. 
After such a preface one may perhaps be allowed to

mention motion pictures. One hesitates to do it for 
the reason that they are so generally misused; but, 
on the other hand, they embody such splendid possi- 
bilities for real education that teachers cannot af- 
ford to surrender them to those who abuse them. 
Motion pictures supply a fine substitute for the 
drama, and often give values that untrained and im- 
provised drama cannot give. Recently I witnessed 
a representation of Robin Hood and his merry men 
in old Sherwood Forest. The whole thing was ex- 
cellent. It gave one a very definite and striking 
notion of many things that the books present only 
feebly. The outdoor forest scenes, the wild life of 
the outlaws of medieval England, the dangers of 
travel, the castle life of the nobles, the task of the 
king’s sheriffs, the skillful play with the rude quarter- 
staff, and the marvelous skill of the English archers, 
using the famous long bow, were all made very clear 
and vivid. 
In large schools or in any place where a considerable 
number of persons may be secured for the occasion, 
historical pageants have great possibilities. They 
have a value from their imposing proportions as well 
as from their particular features. One of the finest 
lessons in American history it was ever my good 
fortune to receive came from a pageant in which about 
a thousand men and women took part. Nearly all 
the leading characters from Elizabeth’s court to the 
wild borders of the New World were there. They

  160 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
walked and talked in the forms and terms of truth. 
Nearly every State was represented, with some of 
its important persons or some of the most famous 
events in its history. The appeal to the imagination 
through the eye as well as through the ear was strong 
and lasting. The values of the |undertaking far 
overshadowed the slight tasks of preparation.

classroom work is ‘‘Colonial Plays for the Schoolroom,” by

CHAPTER XIV 
THE VISUAL APPEAL IN THE TEACHING OF 
HISTORY 
Dvunrine our waking hours the eye-gate is nearly 
always open. With children it is wide open. We 
can hardly appreciate how much we are continually 
receiving through our eyes until there comes a sudden 
breakdown at the electric “‘ plant,” and darkness 
closes the gate — this wondrous gate to the soul. 
We hear the music in the hedge, or at best a mile 
away ; but not only does the eye show the feathered 
singer near us, in his beauty coat, and the mile-away 
procession, whence the distant music sounds, it 
also reaches out to the far mountain summit where 
winds are turning trees to harps, and even up to the 
shining stars, each of which perhaps “‘ in his motion 
like an angel sings’; but we cannot hear them. 
The ear admits innumerable guests that come knock- 
ing at the door of our understanding; but the eye 
admits more and entertains them longer. The eye 
reaches so far and takes the message so quickly that 
a great world, measureless in extent and infinite in 
variety, is given to our consciousness every moment ; 
yet there is no jumble, no confusion: all is in perfect 
order, harmony, and proportion. 
M 161

162 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN) HISTORY 
It has been said we remember one tenth of what 
we hear, five tenths of what we see, and nine tenths 
of what we do. This is perhaps a fair statement, 
generally true, yet somewhat misleading. The facts 
are perhaps not completely stated. For instance, 
in estimating what we receive or retain from what the 
hand does, we should take account of the great con- 
tribution the eye makes to the skill and efficiency 
of the hand. In other words, part of the nine tenths 
of a possible maximum benefit credited to the hand 
(the doing) should be credited to the eye, under whose 
guidance the hand works, and through which we get 
much of the knowledge and memory treasure sup- 
posedly acquired in the process of doing. If we 
doubt this, let us try working with our hands in the 
dark. Our skill— even our long-practiced skill — 
will miss, and we shall have a very vague notion of 
what we really have accomplished. It seems difficult 
to talk— even to talk — well in the dark, though 
we may have a beautiful picture on the screen, just 
at the shadow’s edge. 
“ Seeing is believing” because seeing is so gen- 
erally understanding. When the boy does not com- 
prehend your explanation, he says, ‘‘ I don’t see it ”’ ; 
but ‘‘ Now I see it,’’ he exclaims when he gets your 
point. The philosopher who said, ‘‘ We are slaves 
to our eyes,’’ must have meant not only that we are 
largely dependent upon them, but also that we most 
readily and quickly follow them. 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
  THE VISUAL APPEAL 163 
One reason, perhaps the chief reason, why drama 
makes such a tremendous appeal is because it sends 
the fact flashing in through the open eye-gate. The 
motion picture gains its superiority over the ordinary 
sort for the reason that it enables us to see so much 
more. Costume and scenery and fierce countenance 
and corded muscles could add no whit of effect, 
either in drama or motion picture, if the audience 
were blind. If the audience were blind, the motion 
picture would be nothing and the drama would lose 
more than half its force. 
My point, therefore, is simply this: Let the history 
teacher, as well as the art teacher, appreciate the 
open eye-gate and utilize the many facilities at hand 
for keeping it thronged with the swift-winged mes- 
sengers of beauty and truth. 
In the textbooks are maps and pictures: they are 
there for a purpose, and in the hands of a competent 
teacher they have a great value. Maps and pictures 
on the walls of the room are of still greater value, 
because they are seen continually and attention may 
so readily be directed to them by the teacher’s pointer 
and pointed words. The relics and models in the 
school museum are worth something as a mere collec- 
tion, but their usefulness may be quadrupled if the 
teacher will bring them before his class and make 
them illustrate the statements of the text. 
Every school, large or small, should have a museum. 
In every new building erected for school use, an ap-
-P-A-G-E-176
Oe een Ment re tr ae 
' 
| 164 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
propriate room should be provided for natural, scien- 
tific, literary, artistic, and historical collections. It 
would be better still if every class room were equipped 
with cases and shelves for the storing of particular 
collections. By this arrangement art collections 
would be in the art room, literary collections in the 
literature room, and historical collections in the his- 
tory room, all ready at hand when needed. In every 
community are many relics and other objects which 
are continually being lost and broken up, but which 
would be really valuable in a school museum. The 
children of the community should be awakened to 
the interest that centers about such things. Being 
once awakened, and given the opportunity to do so, 
they will vie with one another in finding objects of 
interest and bringing them in as contributions to 
their respective museums. The process of collection 
will be interesting and profitable; the further work 
of classification and labeling will give scientific train- 
ing to pupils and teacher ; and the profit from using 
the growing collections will increase through all the 
future. 
Historical excursions to near-by scenes and build- 
ings increase the pupil’s interest, expand his intelli- 
gence, and clarify his notions, because they give 
him so much through the eye-gate. If a place cannot

  THE VISUAL APPEAL 165 
be visited, let the teacher draw a plan of it on the 
blackboard, if she is sufficiently familiar with it to do 
so. Theplan need not be elaborate, or even accurate 
in every particular: it will still give a more complete 
and more accurate notion than will many words with 
nothing to see. 
Every teacher should build up a collection of draw- 
ings, diagrams, and charts on sheets of paper large 
enough to be seen over the class room. Every such 
diagram or chart put in convenient, permanent 
form, will add so much to the teacher’s material 
equipment, besides clarifying and fixing his own 
knowledge of the things represented. The larger 
the collection grows, from year to year, the less time 
will be required in the preparation to teach the things 
thus portrayed. Furthermore, the economy of time 
to the teacher will be insignificant in comparison 
with the saving of time to the class. Permit the 
citation of an actual experience for illustration. I 
had found that, as a rule, hardly one pupil in a hun- 
dred understood or was able to explain clearly how 
the President and Vice President are chosen. And I 
found it necessary every year to spend two or three 
periods, of fifty minutes each, on as many successive 
days, in the effort to make the process clear. Fi- 
nally, a simple and rather crude diagram was made, 
and placed on the blackboard (later on a wall chart) 
before the class. What then? Twenty minutes 
seemed worth as much as two hours before. What
-P-A-G-E-178
166 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
  made the difference? Simply this: There was some- 
thing to see, and everybody saw it. 
Economy of time, economy of energy, definiteness 
of notion, permanence of impression — these are 
certainly values worth considering ; and these values 
may frequently be realized more fully by utilizing 
the eye-gate than by any other means. 
In story-telling the skillful teacher will use action, 
facial expression, this or that object, or make such 
and such marks on the blackboard. She is thereby 
heightening the effect of her words and tone of voice. 
In the study of biography she will show pictures of 
the persons and pictures and maps of the places with 
which the persons have been associated. A vivid, 
orderly notion of the physical geography amid which 
a boy grew to manhood will give every normal boy 
a better notion of what his hero was and how he came 
to be thus or thus. 
It is the open eye-gate that makes travel so swift 
and rich in its results. A half-hour in Independence 
Hall is better than a month of books that tell about 
it. You stand before the cracked old liberty bell, 
and get such a vision of other days and other scenes 
as you have never had before. Since it belonged to 
remote years, you imagined a little bell and a rather 
feeble voice; but when you see that it is as tall as a 
man and weighs over a ton you get an enlarged vision 
of the liberty it proclaimed throughout the land. 
You have read the Declaration of Independence and
-P-A-G-E-179
THE VISUAL APPEAL 167 
the Articles of Confederation and the Federal Con- 
stitution, and you have read much about them; but 
when you walk into the East Room, the “‘ Independ- 
ence Chamber,” you experience a new sense of reality. 
Here the Declaration was signed; here the Articles 
of Confederation were drafted; here the great con- 
vention met in 1787, and here the Constitution was 
finally wrought out. In this room Washington was 
made commander of the American army, and here the 
captured banners from Yorktown were finally laid 
down as trophies of victory. Yonder is the identical 
table upon which the Declaration lay when men took 
their lives as well as their pens in hand to make it 
good. There are some of the old leather-finished 
chairs in which they sat and listened to Richard 
Henry Lee, John Hancock, Franklin, Madison, and 
Hamilton. And all around upon the walls hang 
portraits — portraits of the patriots who labored 
here to build a nation, and whose very spirits seem 
now to come again and charge us to maintain in justice 
and honor what they established at so much sacrifice. 
It is a dream of mine that some day, sooner or 
later, every normal school and college in our land 
shall have for its history department an endowment, 
liberal and secure, provided for the specific purpose 
of enabling the history classes to travel at least three 
months of every year, under the direction and in- 
struction of their teachers. A term of history study, 
connected with travel, will be worth more than three  
-P-A-G-E-180
    168 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
terms in books alone. Geography may thus be com: 
bined with history, and literature also, to some ex 
tent. The time thus gained will make possible the ad- 
justment of programs and render the whole scheme 
entirely practicable.

provides an excellent series of historical pictures, which are much 
enhanced in value by the well-prepared historical sketches

  CHAPTER XV 
HELPING THE PUPIL TO STUDY 
PLEASE observe the caption is not “ studying for 
the pupil,” but ‘“ helping the pupil to study.” It 
might very well be ‘‘ studying to help the pupil,” 
or “ finding ways to help the pupil to help himself.” 
Either extreme — any extreme— is almost in- 
evitably bad. The teacher who does or tries to do 
everything for the child, all the time, is just as bad 
as the one who never does or tries to do anything for 
him, at any time. In fact, neither one is a teacher. 
The former is an infant’s nurse; the latter is a guide- 
post with the inscription rubbed off. Every mean is 
somewhere between the extremes, but not every mean 
is golden. In my opinion, the teacher, especially 
the teacher of young pupils, had better err on the side 
of helping too much than of helping too little. 
In fact, it is the teacher’s business to help the pupil, 
whether the latter is young or old. Some so-called 
teachers do not help; but they are not, then, really 
teachers. Every real teacher is a helper, a leader, 
an inspirer, a benefactor. The question, therefore, 
is not, “‘ Shall I help my pupil?” but ‘“ How can I 
help him most and best? ” 
169  
-P-A-G-E-182
    170 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
No teacher can help his pupil most by carrying 
him when he ought to walk, or by making him so 
dependent upon crutches that he never feels able to 
stand erect and strong upon his own feet. Teaching, 
good teaching, is like good charity. It is a form of 
loving service, aiming to make every sane, healthy 
person a self-supporting, law-maintaining, society- 
‘helping citizen. Society comprises just two classes : 
lifters'and leaners. It-is the teacher’s business to be 
“glifter,and to help his pupils to - into the same 
class as fast as possible. -

Eliminate him from present consideration. I am 
speaking of the earnest student, who is working 
himself to death, or thinks he is, without getting 
much forward. He has my sympathy. He needs 
help, and deserves it. 
The main trouble is, so many teachers have 
not learned the art of studying. No wonder if they 
find teaching others how to study difficult. Little 
wonder if they forget to make the effort to do so. 
To master the task may require years of study and 
experiment ; to indicate completely a course of pro- 
cedure might demand a large volume; but let us 
 
-P-A-G-E-183
HELPING THE PUPIL TO STUDY 171 
briefly consider here a few principles and methods 
that may prove helpful to teacher or pupil. 
No one can study well without good power of at- 
tention. Accordingly, every student should contin- 
ually endeavor to strengthen this power in and for 
himself. This he may do not only by persistently 
controlling his own thought and directing it accord- 
ing to his own purposes, but also by insisting that 
other persons respect the rights of his spirit as well.ag, 
the rights of his body. It is no more,yydeand unjust 
for a fellow to break imto your, reli nit oo ont 
head with a stick than it is for him to come rushing 
in, or shambling in, and break up the hard-wrought 
fabric of thought that you have been getting into 
form with infinite pains, and scatter the fragments 
far and wide. You should not allow him to do it. 
(Students must learn to respect one another’s study 
rights.) You have no more right to walk into your 
neighbor’s study hour than you have to smash his 
watch; and you should be ready to defend your own 
study hour as valiantly as your gold. 
Possibly it may be well for advanced students, 
after each one has mastered the lesson for himself, 
to get into a group for_discussion; but frequently 
such a proceeding is not only a great waste of time, 
but also a process that results in making the weaker 
members of the group still weaker. These likely 
come in before they have done anything, and go away 
imagining they have done something, when in reality
-P-A-G-E-184
  172 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
they have only listened to others say something — 
something usually of less value than the poorest 
line of the textbook. 
Sooner or later the pupil must learn to dig, to dig 
for himself, and to dig hard and long; otherwise he 
can never be a real student. 
About as bad as trying to study in a room full of 
talkers is trying to do it outdoors, under a fragrant 
tree, in early springtime. Pupils do not really 
go outdoors to study books, at such times. They 
go to smell the blossoms, to hear the hum of the bees, 
to watch the quick flight of the birds, to lie upon the 
velvety grass, to look up into the promising skies, 
and to dream of things far away. All this is excel- 
lent, in its place and proportion, but it is not serious 
study in books. Even though a thing is gold, do not 
fool yourself by imagining that you always need gold. 
Sometimes you need iron. If you want to read a 
book without distraction, go where you will see only 
the words on the page, where you will hear only the 
thrilling call of flying thought, and where you will 
feel only the struggle of your own soul to follow the 
call. 
Dry and deadening textbooks are often a serious 
impediment to study; and the teacher can help the 
pupil very much by throwing such books away. 
There is no sufficient reason why any textbook should 
be dull and dry. Nature is beautiful with color and 
form, with adaptation and harmony, clad with flowers
-P-A-G-E-185
    HELPING THE PUPIL TO STUDY 173 
while ribbed with granite. No book can truly and 
adequately portray nature without a beauty-painting 
power. Truth is interesting and simple always, 
when clearly seen. A book that makes truth clear 
is bound to be simple and interesting. Obscurity 
may be profundity, but it is the profundity of shadow. 
There is no need for an author to be boring in order to 
be accurate. And there is no need for a boy or a 
girl to be bored and disgusted with a dull book of 
history, for nowadays there are plenty of books, accu- 
rate as any, that will stir the very soul of youth. 
There are, of course, a few things worse than a dull 
textbook. One of them is an occasional soul of 
youth that will not be stirred. Such a person is like 
powder that is not the least disturbed by the touch 
of fire. But there are only a few so bad as that. 
aE can be stirred, but it takes much patient effort 
in taany cases to make the fiery touch. Dozens 
of our rising citizens can read Antony’s speech over 
Cesar without twitching a nerve or changing a tone. 
As many more can read what John Richard Green 
says about Joan of Arc, or even sing the “ Star- 
Spangled Banner,” with the same Olympian calm. 
But is it ‘‘ Olympian ” calm? I doubt it. I fear 
it is, in plain terms, that sort of deadness that Scott 
suggested with so much unwillingness in the lines, — 
“Breathes there a man with soul so dead, 
Who never to himself hath said, 
‘This is my own, my native land’?”
-P-A-G-E-186
  174 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
What accounts for such deadness on the part of 
occasional young Americans of fair average intelli- 
gence? Is it indifference? Hardly. Is it an af- 
fected cynicism? Not often. Is it a blasé egotism? 
Let us hope not. 
In my opinion it may be explained by what I shall 
call, for want of a better phrase, “‘ innocency of 
words.” To them words have little meaning. In 
their memories many words are like distant friends 
of long ago. In their imaginations words do not 
leap into life and rush up with a life and death 
message. In their thought words are not things, 
vital and concrete, to be seen and felt, shaking the 
world. 
Doubtless it is chiefly the business of the teacher 
of reading to get the pupil to understand and appre- 
ciate words, to visualize a sentence or a page, and to 
enter into the fellowship of silent thought with a 
feeling of kinship and even of ecstasy; but the 
teacher of history, as well as the teacher of mathe- 
matics, is a continual witness of the disaster that a 
lack of such power brings, and is forced to the con- 
clusion that he and every other teacher must help 
to awaken this power. 
How shall this power be awakened? Undoubtedly, 
the teacher that succeeds in taking away this “ in- 
nocency of words ” by making the pupil see and feel 
what the printed page really tells will do more than 
all others to help the pupil to study.
-P-A-G-E-187
  
HELPING THE PUPIL TO STUDY 175 
Somewhere at a handy place in your history note- 
book there should be a straight column of carefully 
written words. Those words were put there one at 
a time, as you found them in your history lessons 
day by day. When you wrote them down you did not 
know their meanings, but now you know, because you 
have written the proper statement as to meaning or 
meanings after each one. You have carried this 
process on so long that it has become a second nature 
. to you. You could not be satisfied not to doit. To 
pass over an unfamiliar word without nailing it would 
keep you from sleep at night. You are positively rest- 
less until you know what a strange word signifies. 
It would be just as impossible for you to be satisfied 
about an urgent message you had failed to deliver, 
or not to keep groping after the name of an old friend 
who passed you on the street until you grasp it, as it 
would be for you to slur lazily over an unknown word 
in your reading. In short, you_have the dictionary 
habit. It has become inveterate with you. If you 
can make the habit contagious, and give it to that 
pupil of yours, it will gradually get him into a new 
world. His innocence as to common words is hold- 
ing him back from man’s estate. 
I believe that many pupils waste time by reading 
too fast. More exactly, they lose values by trying 
to read too fast. Naturally some persons read faster 
than others, just as some think faster and talk faster ; 
but when a student, particularly an immature stu-
-P-A-G-E-188
176 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
dent, races over thirty or forty pages in an hour the 
chances are that he is not studying well. He may 
intend to go over it again; but if he does go over it 
a second time, or even a third time, he will almost 
certainly do it as superficially as he did it the first 
time. One thorough, thoughtful reading would prob- 
ably enable him to understand more and to remem- 
ber more than two or three flying chances. So far as 
the values in careful habits are concerned, there can 
hardly be any question. The chances are that the 
boy who reads twenty pages an hour is a better stu- 
dent than the one who reads thirty in the same time. 
Whatever stimulates the imagination or touches 
the feeling or broadens experience of life quickens 
appreciation of words and helps the reader to visual- 
ize his page. Poetry, fiction, and drama may all be 
used to good effect. There is nothing, however, like 
real life. Real life cannot always be had to order, 
upon call; yet a rich and varied experience on the 
part of the teacher may in some measure be trans- 
mitted to the pupil. It will help him to live as he 
reads. 
The dictionary habit, cultivating imagination and 
feeling, treasuring and utilizing rich experiences, 
reading slowly and filling out the statement with your 
own thought: these are some of the things that will 
make the printed page a busy highway of life, 
thronged with friends we long have known as well as 
with strangers whose graces soon give us pleasure.
-P-A-G-E-189
HELPING THE PUPIL TO STUDY 177 
The student must learn to discriminate as he reads. 
Not all persons who appear in the narrative, not all 
topics mentioned in the discussion, not all dates re- 
corded here and there are of equal importance. The 
reader of history who takes everything at the same 
value, and makes a uniform effort to remember every- 
body and everything and every time and every place, 
may be an earnest plodder, but he is not a good stu- 
dent. The teacher should, of course, give special 
and definite aid to the pupil in the effort to develop 
the power of intelligent discrimination. A plan like 
this is simple and helpful. You have just assigned 
the lesson for to-morrow: Chapter XIX, let us say, 
in Nida’s The Dawn of American History in Europe. 
You say to the class : — 
“Tn this chapter you will find the names of four 
famous men. All of them did some great deeds; but 
two of them did such deeds because they couldn’t 
help doing them, while the other two did them be- 
cause they wished to do them. As you find these 
men and see what they did, try to group them as I 
have indicated. All four are famous men: decide 
for yourselves whether all were great men or not. I 
shall ask for opinions at the close of the lesson to- 
morrow.” 
As teacher you should also help the pupils to dis- 
tinguish between generals and particulars. The 
poor student often flounders about in hopeless con- 
fusion, amid a multitude of incidents, failing to see 
N
-P-A-G-E-190
    178 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
that they merely come in to explain or illustrate the 
main statement, which he perhaps overlooks alto- 
gether. Take, for example, the particular chapter 
just referred to above. Lither first or last you might 
say to the class: — 
“Please notice the real subject of this chapter: 
what is it? ” 
Among a variety of answers you would probably 
get} the correct one: “‘ The winning of English lib- 
erty.” Having written this on the blackboard, in 
large letters, you might continue :— 
“ Do you see how nearly all the particular incidents 
recorded in the chapter go to show this one thing? 
The signing of the Great Charter, the demands of 
the Great Council under the Great Charter, the high- 
handed measures of Simon of Montfort, the sum- 
moning of the knights to sit with the bishops and 
barons, the making of the Model Parliament, are all 
steps in the same process; so I write them down here 
under the main topic, a little further to the right, 
andinasmaller hand. It will help you very much to 
see that we are not studying about a half dozen great 
subjects here, but just one; and that the half dozen 
particular things, though of great importance, are 
really given to make the one thing clear. Always 
try to find the main subject, and then notice how 
other things take rise from it or come up and lean 
against it.” 
Along with discrimination, analysis, and subordi-
-P-A-G-E-191
HELPING THE PUPIL TO STUDY 179 
nation of details go naturally classification and asso- 
ciation. We set things of the same class together 
in thought, even though they were actually separated 
by ages and hemispheres. We may associate many 
things helpfully, even though they may not be much 
alike. 
It should not be necessary in this full year of grace 
to say that history lessons should not be committed 
to memory, word for word. This is not saying that 
memory is an unimportant factor in education. It 
is fundamental. Neither is it saying’ that once in 
a while some fine passage may not be learned or re- 
cited verbatim. What I mean is simply this: It is 
usually much better for the student to make the 
author’s thought his own thought, and thus remem- 
ber the facts in his own words. Expression in his 
own words will then be natural and easy. 
Once in a while the teacher may read over a lesson 
with the class in advance, to enrich their own subse- 
quent reading. Frequently he may give much aid by 
suggesting certain points of lookout — high points of 
observation— whence the field may be seen to special 
advantage. A word of suggestion in advance is often 
worth more than a long talk after the matter is old. 
When all teachers become real students — when 
they study the pupil as well as the facts and forces 
of human knowledge, and come to understand the 
processes by which the student may comprehend 
these facts and forces — then all teachers will become   
-P-A-G-E-192

real helpers. Thenevery history teacher will be a 
benefactor to society, and every normal citizen will 
become an appreciative, life-long student of history. 
SUMMARY 
1. Introduction 
(1) It is the teacher’s business to help the pupil. 
(2) The question is “How?” 
(3) Teaching the art of studying is one of the best 
ways. 
(4) Many teachers themselves need to learn the art. 
2. Development 
(1) The student must have power of attention. 
a. He must develop this power in himself ; 
b. He must demand from others a respect for 
his study rights. 
(2) Studying in groups is of doubtful value. 
(3) The student must be able to dig. Digging is an 
individual process. 
(4) Studying outdoors is of doubtful value. 
(5) The teacher may help the pupil by throwing away 
dry and deadening textbooks. 
(6) The teacher must try to fire up the dead pupil. 
(7) “Innocency of words” is a prevalent condition 
of soul deadness. 
(8) This innocency must give way to visualizing 
power through 
. The dictionary habit ; 
. The cultivation of imagination and feeling ; 
The utilizing of life experiences ; 
. Slow reading and quick thinking. ages 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
  HELPING THE PUPIL TO STUDY 181 
(9) The student must learn to appreciate differences 
of value — to discriminate — in his reading 
and study. 
(10) He must also get into the habit of seizing upon 
the few essential, general facts, and seeing 
how the many particulars serve merely the 
purpose of explanation and illustration. 
(11) He must learn to recognize the people and the 
things that are alike: thus he will be able 
to reduce them all to a few classes. 
(12) Association of things related, similar, or contem- 
porary is helpful and interesting. 
(18) Study should register itself in memory, but in the 
student’s own words and phrases rather than 
in those of the author. 
(14) A preview, judiciously directed by the teacher, is 
often better than a review. 
3. Conclusion 
When all teachers become real helpers, all citizens will 
become real students.

tended not only toaid the pupil in getting the gist of this chapter, 
but also to suggest and illustrate what may be done by the pupil 
himself with the other chapters of this book and with other

CHAPTER XVI 
THE DYNAMICS OF HISTORY-TEACHING 
In the world of matter a dynamo stands for power 
and a source of power. It converts mechanical en- 
ergy into electrical energy, or vice versa, by means of 
magnetic induction. It is capable of serving either 
as a generator or as a motor. 
Without attempting to carry parallels too far, let 
us consider a few that are obvious. In the world of 
spirit a dynamo is a person of power, or a combination 
of active powers ina person. Such a person converts 
intellectual energy into moral energy, or vice versa, by 
means of magnetic induction. A human dynamo is 
capable of serving either as a generator or as a motor. 
As a matter of fact, every dynamic person is likely 
to be both a generator and a motor. 
Every teacher should bea human dynamo. Every 
schoolroom should be a magnetic field. Every pupil 
that enters that magnetic field should feel the thrill 
of transmitted energy, and in due time have within 
himself the activities that generate and the powers 
that move. 
It matters little what you call this power: the 
essential thing is for you to have it and to communi- 
182
-P-A-G-E-195
  THE DYNAMICS 183 
cate it. Call it, if you please, magnetic personality ; 
call it moral force; call it human interest; call it 
soul power ; call it the gift to inspire; call it uncon- 
scious intuition; call it the ability to arouse interest 
and ambition; but try to get it and try to exert it. 
One day, nearly a century ago, in a little Virginia 
town, a boy stood before a teacher. The boy was 
poor; he was ignorant; he was meanly clad. But 
he had in his soul some divine fire. That teacher 
stirred the fire. That seems to have been about all 
he did, for he saw the boy only two or three times. 
But, for his part, that was enough. In the years that 
followed the uncouth boy became a great scholar, a 
great teacher, a master of many arts, a master of 
thought, a light in literature. His name, Joseph 
Salyards, has been a household word in northern 
Virginia for two generations. 
How can we account for this remarkable transfor- 
mation? Salyards himself gave the explanation 
when, as an old man, full of years and honors, he 
wrote to his old teacher. He said, “‘ You inspired 
me.” 
There is telling, there is teaching, there is touching. 
I am speaking now of touching. Those persons who 
stand in schoolrooms and talk, while all the time their 
thoughts and desires and interests are outside, are 
mere tellers. They might be replaced with phono- 
graphs without serious loss. Those persons who 
bring some light into schoolrooms, but go away leay-
-P-A-G-E-196
    
184 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
ing them still cold, are perhaps teachers. They in- 
form their pupils with facts, they let in the light to 
that degree, but the source of light never gets near 
enough, somehow, to fire the child’s soul. His deep- 
est feelings, his strongest energies, are not aroused. 
But that man, that woman, whose soul speaks a 
language that the child’s soul answers to is a toucher. 
And the toucher is, after all, the real teacher. The 
power to touch is the supreme test of the teacher. 
Socrates and Jesus and all great teachers have done 
their greatest work and exerted their most far-reach- 
ing influence through their heart-touching power. 
A few years ago I listened to an address delivered 
before a large educational gathering by my friend, 
Professor Edwin Mims, of Vanderbilt University, 
His subject was ‘‘ Mechanics and Dynamics in Edu- 
cation.” It seemed to me then, it has seemed to 
me ever since, that he brought two great worlds of 
truth into balance in those two terms, as he defined 
them: mechanics and dynamics. Comprehended 
under mechanics are buildings, systems, schedules, 
materials, equipment; concentrated under dynam- 
ics we find the inspiring personality of the teacher, 
the vital and moving interests of the subjects taught, 
and the unconquerable spirit of high aim and achieve- 
ment in the pupil. 
Professor Mims himself is one of the finest examples 
of pedagogical dynamics personally incarnated that 
it has been my privilege to know. It is always a
-P-A-G-E-197
THE DYNAMICS 185 
privilege to know a dynamic teacher. If there was 
good foundation for the fancy that pictured a log with 
a boy on one end of it as a university, because Mark 
Hopkins was made to sit at the other end, then verily 
Mark Hopkins must have been a dynamic teacher. 
His teaching would doubtless have driven that boy 
to the ends of the earth, if necessary, to find what his 
spirit craved. 
The greatest teacher it has ever been my privilege 
to know was Dr. Noah Knowles Davis, for many 
years professor of moral philosophy at the University 
of Virginia. He embodied a number of notable 
qualities: knowledge of facts, wide experience of life, 
the gift of making abstruse things concrete and simple, 
and a marked facility in apt illustration; but I be- 
lieve that most of his old pupils will agree with me 
when I say that his greatest power was that inde- 
finable thing we call personality. It was apparently 
made up in his case of a fierce, unflinching justice, 
balanced by the keenest sympathy; unerring logic, 
balanced by unfailing poetry ; scientific reserve and 
caution, balanced by a terrible earnestness, a burning 
enthusiasm. He taught his young men great truth, 
but the flaming touch of his great spirit drove them 
forth to find greater truth. 
1 Reference may appropriately be made here to the following 
addresses, printed in the N. E. A. Proceedings of 1908, pp. 
108-128: ‘The Personal Touch in Teaching,” by A. F. 
West; and ‘‘The Personal Power of the Teacher in Public School 
Work,” by W. H. Maxwell.
-P-A-G-E-198
  186 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
For the history teacher mechanics may include a 
place of work, the schoolroom, let us say; historical 
maps, books of history, pictures, relics, and a graded 
course of study. Dynamics would be the moving 
forces of human interest, gathered from the human 
race, that drive the souls of teacher and pupil forward 
along the ways of light and life. 
What, now, for me, if I am a teacher of history, is 
“ starting the dynamo ”’? 
It is getting the pupil intelligently interested in 
history. It is getting him vitally interested, so that 
in due time he will generate interest for himself, and 
will not need to be led on by another. It is getting 
him interested in human life, through history, so that 
he will thereby enter into fellowship with the race in 
all of its normal aims and activities. It is giving him 
such an undying ambition to be somebody of worth, 
and to do something worth while, that he will never 
be content in idleness or in selfishness, but will strive 
as a man to contribute his due portion to the welfare 
of society. 
In the next place, how is the dynamo to be started ? 
Whether it is started or not will depend in a meas- 
ure on what the teacher knows; in greater measure, 
on what she can do; in greatest measure, on what 
she is. 
Skillful adaptation of topics, of books, of construc- 
tion work, and attractive presentation of men, women, 
and children in story and in biography will be almost 
 
-P-A-G-E-199
    THE DYNAMICS 187 
certain to win the child’s attention and develop his 
liking for such work and such acquaintances. Such 
a liking on his part is the birth of interest, and is a 
guarantee of his further effort in continual seeking 
and acquiring. 
Liking, interest, enthusiasm, are more readily 
caught than taught. How fortunate it is that vir- 
tues and graces are just as contagious as vices and 
diseases! Accordingly, the teacher of history, of 
anything, needs not only knowledge of his subject 
and skill in imparting the facts of that subject, in- 
cluding the ability to direct study, but he also needs 
enthusiasm in his subject, a spirit of happy conta- 
gion. He must himself find delight in doing what 
he asks the pupil to do. 
The teacher that arouses in his pupil a deep and 
abiding interest in history succeeds in the most vital 
point, in whatever else he may fail; on the other 
hand, the teacher that provokes in his pupil a dislike 
for the subject fails in the worst way, even though 
he fix a thousand facts. If history were something 
to be passed off and then cast off, it might not be so; 
but history portrays and interprets life, and is needed 
for life in every generation. 
Does any one inquire, Why has this chapter been 
held back until now? or, Why was it not put first? 
Let answer be made: The need of arousing the pupil’s 
interest has been indicated repeatedly in preceding 
chapters, but the subject has been reserved for special 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
188 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
treatment here for two reasons. First, it is hoped 
that here some accumulated notions may add empha- 
sis to what is deemed of so much importance. Sec- 
ond, it is about the end of the grades or the beginning 
of the high school that the interests of the child must 
expand into the interests of the youth. Somewhere 
here are dawns of great awakening. Somewhere 
here is a mystic borderland, fringed with fancies, 
haunted more or less with phantoms, but lighted 
day and night with fair, far visions, in which the 
stars of hope kiss all the hills of promise. These are 
dynamic days. Impulses and aims do here take 
deep hold of life.

CHAPTER XVII 
WHY SOME PUPILS DISLIKE HISTORY 
Ir is true, we all know, that some pupils do not like 
history. When it is true, the matter presents rather 
serious problems in every case. It means that both 
teacher and pupil are going to encounter unnecessary 
difficulties. It may mean discouragement and failure 
to both. At the very best, so long as the pupil does 
not like history he is not going to study it with 
avidity or appreciation. He may have to be driven 
to it to study it at all, and this may mean that he’ 
will be driven away from it with an everlasting dis- 
like, if not disgust. All this means vital loss to the 
pupil. As for the teacher, it means failure in some 
degree. At the least, it increases her work and mul- 
tiplies her difficulties and discouragements. 
It is certainly worth while, then, to find out if we 
can why some pupils dislike history, especially if by 
doing so we can in any measure cure their dislike or, 
much better still, prevent it. 
To find out the truth of the matter, I have been 
able to think of no better way than asking the pupils 
themselves. Accordingly, I have made a special 
canvass for several years past, and have interrogated 
189
-P-A-G-E-202
  190 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
hundreds of different students, from various parts 
of the country, on this particular point and related 
matters. 
I have asked them these questions :— 
“ Do you like history, or do you not like it? ” 
“Tf you like it, why do you like it? ” 
“ Tf you do not like it, why not? ” 
Here are some of the most significant answers given 
by those who said they did not like history :— 
“T did not find it interesting.” 
“T had never seen any historical places.” 
“T did not know why I was studying it.” 
“ My teacher did not like it.” 
“ T was entered too high.”’ 
“ T was given a book too hard for me.” 
When a large number said that they did not find 
history interesting, they perhaps really said about 
this: “I did not like history because I did not like 
it.” But the sad fact still remains that they did not 
like it. Moreover, a number of them gave some 
master-keys to the situation. For example, one said, 
“Tt was not interesting — the teacher merely heard 
the lesson.”” Another said, ‘‘ My teacher just taught 
me facts and dates, without any stories or interesting 
things.” Another, “It was presented to me in a 
very difficult form.’ Another, ‘The teacher did 
not make it interesting.” And soon. Is there not 
a secret here revealed? Whisper it softly: The 
main fault lay with the teacher !
-P-A-G-E-203
  WHY SOME PUPILS DISLIKE HISTORY 191 
This disclosure may be rather crushing to the 
teacher’s pride; but after all is not the situation 
fortunate? Is it not much better to find that the 
trouble is due to a temporary aberration in a few 
teachers than to find it due to a constitutional defect 
in the pupils? Certainly it is easier to reach the 
intelligent teacher, who is anxious to solve the prob- 
lem, than it is to reach the unthinking pupil, who 
frequently does not care whether he likes history or 
not. Moreover, if the fault be in the teacher, reach- 
ing the teacher effectively will cure the ills for all 
concerned. Curing the teacher is healing the nation. 
When so many different persons, without any 
chance for malicious collusion, say the same thing 
and thus agree that it was the teacher’s failure when 
history was not interesting, it behooves the earnest 
teacher to be patient and listen. Thus may he 
profit. Can we wonder that when the teacher 
merely ‘hears the lesson,’’ or presents facts in a 
difficult form, or requires the pupil to memorize one 
section after another, or brings in ‘“ only what is in 
the book,” or does not like history himself, the pupil 
should find the subject lacking attractiveness and 
interest? Under such conditions it would be a 
wonder, indeed, if the boy or girl did like history. 
But please observe that all these unfortunate 
conditions are things for which the teacher is re- 
sponsible, and which he can change for the better if 
he will.
-P-A-G-E-204
  192 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
But may we not blame the parents if the boy is 
“ entered too high ’’? or censure the school board or 
the state department if the textbook is too hard and 
dry? Perhaps, a little. But after all, my fellow 
teacher, you and I are still guilty. If the child is 
put into this or that grade, or this or that class, 
when he ought to be in a lower place, you and I have 
had something to do with it. If the book is toohard 
for him, we cannot justify ourselves by saying the 
state has done it, or the local board has done it, and 
I cannot help it. It is the teacher’s business to 
help just such things, among many others. If the 
boy and the book do not fit together, let us hold the 
boy back a little, or hold the book back a little. If 
we cannot do either, let us make the book easy for 
him, or hold him responsible at first for only the easier 
parts of it. 
A short time ago I had a very interesting con- 
ference with a young lady who told me that in her 
childhood she had “ just hated history.”” The main 
trouble, she thought, was with the textbook that 
had been forced into her hands. “ It was too hard 
for me,” she said; “I could not understand it, and 
of course I could not get interested in it. I have 
only recently overcome my dislike for history, and 
I have just within the last few days come to take a 
real pleasure in that old book which (along with my 
teacher) I blame for my childhood troubles with 
history.”
-P-A-G-E-205
WHY SOME PUPILS DISLIKE HISTORY 193 
“T am glad,” said I, ‘‘ that you have at last been 
able to use that old book with pleasure. May I ask 
what use you have been making of it? ” 
Said she, “I have been cutting it up and using 
the pictures in my notebook.” 
Poor teachers and dry, misfit books! Here are 
the two chief reasons for uninterested pupils. The 
former reason is personal and responsible. It must 
shoulder the latter. 
Fortunately there are in history so many forces 
that thrillingly appeal to the human mind and heart 
that both the reasons just mentioned, a poor teacher 
and a juiceless or misfit textbook, are usually re- 
quired in combination to kill out the spirit and in- 
terest of the normal boy or girl. Fortunately, again, 
it does not often happen that these two evils are 
found in company; but by a saving mercy of Prov- 
idence the combination usually encountered is 
this: Good book plus bad teacher; or this: Bad 
book plus good teacher. Accordingly, a guilty 
pedagogue is often overshadowed and partly re- 
deemed by a good textbook; and sometimes an 
otherwise impossible book is recreated and made 
interesting by a good teacher. 
Happily, another ground of hope is found here. 
I have ascertained, from a number of cases investi- 
gated, that, although the child’s dislike for history 
sometimes lasts through life, it is generally possible 
for the unfortunate pupil to displace in later years 
o  
-P-A-G-E-206
194 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
his early indifference or aversion with a real and 
permanent interest. This desirable change of atti- 
tude may usually be hastened by a better teacher, 
who unfolds skillfully the wonderful human kindness 
of history to the quickening and awakening spirit 
of youth. I believe that only a very few cases of 
dislike for history are altogether incurable. In 
these few it is the abnormalities of the patient 
rather than the unskill of the doctor or the inefficacy 
of the remedies that block the way. So much for the 
teacher’s consolation. 
Having enumerated in the beginning of this chapter 
some of the things that cause pupils to dislike history, 
things to be avoided by the teacher, let us catalogue 
now some of the things that have been credited with 
an effect in arousing interest in and liking for the 
subject. Here area few. They all have been men- 
tioned specifically by large numbers of students. 
“T love humanity, and hence am interested in 
things that people have done and are doing.” 
““T was blessed with a better teacher.” 
“Tt is a beautiful subject. It brings before us 
noble men and women, engaged in noble and wonder- 
ful work.” 
“The teacher was interested and made it inter- 
esting to me.” 
“ Tt is related to literature.” 
“Tt helps to explain and appreciate our present 
civil and social conditions.” 
“Tt incites to noble effort.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-207
WHY SOME PUPILS DISLIKE HISTORY 195 
“Tt is real life.” 
“Tt shows that the right usually triumphs in the 
long run.” 
For students in normal schools the following state- 
ments are of special interest and significance :— 
“The interest of my own pupils has stimulated 
my interest.” 
“ T see the part history plays in education.” 
“Tt furnishes me with illustrations.” 
“T am interested in history because I wish to be 
able to teach history successfully.” 
It is suggested to the student and teacher that 
there is an intimate relation between the matter 
of this chapter, particularly the latter part of it, 
and Chapter XVI. History itself is a subject of 
vital and comprehensive interests. The normal 
boy and girl, the earnest man and woman, will 
naturally respond to these interests when they feel 
in any appreciable measure their essence and force. 
With so many good books as we have now from which 
to choose, it would seem that almost any teacher of 
fair equipment and average power ought to be able 
to lead the pupil around and past the bogs of dis- 
like into the fair lands of historical light and promise. 
The best way to avoid dislike is to keep so busy 
over the attractive things that the child will never 
know that anybody ever was discouraged over his- 
tory. When he becomes a man he will put away 
childish things, but he will not put away history. 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
CHAPTER XVIII 
WHY SOME PUPILS FAIL ON EXAMINATIONS 
Some pupils fail through their own faults; some, 
through the faults of their teachers. 
When pupils fail through the errors of their 
teachers the latter are probably guilty of one or 
more of the following faults: (1) Premature pro- 
motion; (2) poor or inadequate teaching; (3) im- 
possible examination questions; (4) bad wording 
of questions; or, (5) unreasonable grading of answers. 
Frequently pupils are promoted to a grade or 
admitted to a school upon too little preparation. 
This is perhaps generally the fault of the teacher 
below, but it often spells failure for the teacher (as 
well as the pupil) above. Poor teaching means 
“poor teacher’; but inadequate teaching may be 
done by a good teacher if the pupil’s preparation 
be deficient or the time allowed for the course of 
instruction be too short. Too many things at- 
tempted and too little time in school are responsible 
for most of the present-day failures in American 
education. Impossible examination questions are 
sometimes given, and answers are occasionally 
graded with unreasonableness. The explanation for 
196
-P-A-G-E-209
WHY SOME PUPILS FAIL ON EXAMINATIONS 197 
this usually is that the teacher is young, or without 
experience, or has so little common sense as to try 
to get college work from grammar-grade students. 
Bad wording of questions is a frequent fault, not 
peculiar to any grade or rank. From the kinder- 
garten to the university, occasional knots in the 
teacher’s English present stumblingblocks to the 
pupil’s reason. 
Teachers, of course, ease their consciences upon 
the assumption that most pupils who fail on examina- 
tions do so because of their own faults or deficiencies. 
Perhaps this is true. At any rate, various lacks 
and confusions on the pupil’s part are certainly 
factors in the result in many instances. Some of 
these lacks and confusions may be stated as follows: 
. Lack of native ability. 
. Lack of knowledge. 
. Confusion of knowledge. 
. Unfortunate and unfamiliar similarities. 
. ‘ Innocency of words.” 
. Indiscriminate reading — lack of attention to 
detail — a phase of the “‘ American habit.” 
1. Some pupils fail simply because they do not 
have the native ability to do exacting mental work. — 
I do not refer to the so-called defectives, but to those 
students who, to all general appearances, are up to 
the average in intellectual capacity, but who habit- 
ually fall somewhat below in every test. There are 
always a few such in every school; and they, of 
aOorPwnr
-P-A-G-E-210
    198 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
course, have great difficulty in doing the work that 
is easy to the brilliant student and generally possible 
to the normal student. 
2. Obviously, outright lack of knowledge is the 
common misfortune of the pupils who fail. — Lack 
of knowledge is indicated by blank spaces upon the 
examination paper, by the frank confession, “I 
don’t know,” or by an answer like the following :— 
“The purpose of the Omnibus Bill was to keep 
foreigners out of our land; author Braddock.” 
The pupil who gave this answer was a hard student, 
and not a “‘ defective ” by any means; but she simply 
did not know the facts. Apparently, however, she 
thought that she knew the facts. She did know some 
facts, but they were much confused. 
8. Confusion of knowledge. — This, I believe, 
is more frequently the cause of poor answers than 
sheer lack of knowledge. Confusion of facts may, 
indeed, be reduced to lack of knowledge; but un- 
der this head I wish to leave ‘‘ blanks ” out of con- 
sideration and call attention to answers that have 
some sense mixed with a good deal of nonsense. 
All the examples given in this chapter are real cases 
that have come under my own personal notice. All 
of them but one have been found upon papers col- 
lected in my own classes during a period of about 
fifteen years. 
Here are some examples of answers that show some 
knowledge of facts, but indicate that the things known
-P-A-G-E-211
a ee ee eee 
WHY SOME PUPILS FAIL ON EXAMINATIONS 199 
were almost as worthless as if they had been entirely 
unknown, being involved in hopeless confusions : — 
1. “St. Augustine, Florida, is the oldest city in the 
world.” 
2. “John Randolph was the father of Pocahontas.” 
3. “James Hargreaves, in 1767, invented the Spinning 
Jenny. He got his idea from a machine called a mule. 
The name Jenny is suggested by the mule.” 
4. “The Charter Oak was in North Carolina. The 
settlers had left, and when they returned they only found 
the word ‘Croatan’ on this oak.” 
5. “A party platform is a place where the men get 
together and decide by a number of votes who will serve 
best in office of any kind.” 
6. “Robert Bruce was the head leader in the rebellion 
for Whales independence.” 
7. “Byzantine Empire was the most important part 
of Europe. Byzan was their leader.” 
8. “The first group of Indians were on the east coast, 
the second up around the Great Lakes, and the third, 
who were in the west, called themselves the Totems.”’ 
9. “Islam was a young girl who, at the age of 18, 
married Philip. He married her for her property. The 
next day he wanted a divorce. Her people objected and 
appealed to the Pope. It was never known why he dis- 
liked her. He treated her very cruelly.” 
Please remember that these answers were not given 
by “‘ defectives,” but by young persons of fair in- 
telligence. They were not incapable, but merely 
confused as to facts.
-P-A-G-E-212
  200 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
A field of frequent confusion is discovered in the 
realm of biography, when an attempt is made to fix 
identities and names. For example, when a class 
in American history was asked to write in a column 
the names of ten Federal generals, and opposite it 
a similar list of Confederate generals, “ Gates” 
and “ Sheridan ’’ were written in the latter column. 
In the lists on other papers were confusions just as 
remarkable. 
If the cases I have cited were without parallels, 
they ought not to be given at all. If I alone had 
found such answers to my questions, the thing for 
me to do would be to look only to my own errors. 
It would mean that I am a poor teacher, and nothing 
more. But it means something more because other 
teachers find the same sort of confusions upon the 
papers they receive from their pupils. Because such 
confusions are common, and could be duplicated 
in kind many times over in nearly every school, they 
have a general interest for teachers, and perhaps 
have a rather far-reaching significance in present-day 
education.! 
As already remarked in the beginning of Chapter 
X, history is one of the subjects that seem to present 
special difficulties. Why is it that so many pupils 
1A recent investigation conducted by H. W. Craven in the 
schools of Seattle, Washington, revealed conditions that were 
surprising, and which would be fairly suggested by the examples 
given above. Conditions in Seattle were probably typical of 
those in many other places.
-P-A-G-E-213
  
WHY SOME PUPILS FAIL ON EXAMINATIONS 201 
fail in history — even in the history of their own 
country? 
First, there are many poor teachers of history 
in our land. It has been a common error to suppose 
that almost anybody will do to teach history. Con- 
sequently, many persons even now trying to teach 
history have no special qualifications for the task, 
and have had no adequate training for it. 
Second, history is not an easy little subject, ~as 
many people suppose. It is a great subject, as big 
as the world, as old as the race, as varied as the 
nations, as comprehensive as life. It is a subject 
of four dimensions, if you please. 
Third, the need of thorough and accurate knowl- 
edge of history has not been sufficiently recognized, 
not to say emphasized, by our school authorities 
and the public in general. It is assumed that arith- 
metic, algebra, physics or chemistry, French or 
Latin, and other subjects, must be studied ; and then 
it is possibly conceded that history may be studied 
if there is a place for it. 
Fourth, insufficient time is allowed for thorough 
work in the schools. This is the main reason why 
pupils lack knowledge of history, and why the facts 
they have laid hold upon are so often in such hope- 
less confusion. It takes a long time to learn history. 
To learn history one must learn geography — be- 
come familiar with many places, here and there, 
separated by wide distances. To learn history  
-P-A-G-E-214
202 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
one must learn biography — get well acquainted 
with a large number of men and women, living at 
different places, in different times, and engaged in 
different enterprises. To learn stor one must 
study out the causes, characters, and consequences 
of numerous events, varying in nature, interest, and 
importance. And to learn history one must grasp 
the ever changing and ever moving front of time, 
and fix the dates of many important events that 
seem scattered with provoking elusiveness over the 
long centuries. 
Recognizing these facts, which are self-evident 
and indisputable, and considering the crowded 
curricula of our schools and the desperate rush that 
is continually on. to ‘ get through ” with it all and 
rush into something else, can we wonder any more 
why pupils do not have a more complete and orderly 
knowledge of history? 
> The cardinal sin of American education to-day is 
the overcrowding of curricula. Some so-called 
educators are trying to cut the school life down, and 
make it a year or two shorter; others are trying to 
put in more subjects; pupils are trying to graduate 
“with their classes ’’; teachers. are trying to push 
them through on schedule time; great truths are 
being ‘‘ smattered ’”’ and nerves are being shattered. 
It is time the current were setting the other way. 
Nature made the school life of man some twenty 
years or more. Man himself is trying to cut down 
 
-P-A-G-E-215
WHY SOME PUPILS FAIL ON EXAMINATIONS 203 
the time and crowd into the task of study many 
more things than nature ever dreamed of. In cut- 
ting down school life we are cutting down life. We are 
making a nation of incapables by trying to do too 
many things in the time at our disposal, which is 
short at the most. We can as easily grow an oak 
in full strength, proportion, and beauty in twenty 
years as we can educate a man adequately in ten or 
fifteen. Education is largely a process of growth. 
For growth — whether in an oak or a man — time, 
much time, is necessary. 
If history is not worth the time necessary to master 
it, let us throw it out of the curriculum, and thus 
gain time for other subjects that are worth while. 
Not mastered, it is not of full value; to master it 
the average pupil needs more time than he is fre- 
quently allowed. If there is nothing else to do, 
let us throw out of American schools all history but 
American history; but if we are going to study 
history at all, let us take a fair chance for mastering 
at least a small field of it. Let us give the pupil 
a fair chance to learn the facts, to get them into 
their right places and right relations, and to become 
so familiar with them that they can be used without 
confusion. 
4. Unfortunate and unfamiliar similarities. — 
In many cases a pupil’s confusion regarding persons, 
places, and incidents in history is led into greater 
mazes by some unlucky suggestion in the examina-
-P-A-G-E-216
  
  204 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
tion question. Here are some illustrations of this 
sort of thing :— 
1. “South Carolina was seceded to the Union in 1860.” 
Herein is an evident confusion of ‘seceded ” 
with “ ceded.” 
2. “In 1844 the Morris telegraph was invented.” 
In this we see a confusion of the unfamiliar name 
“Morse ” with the more familiar name ‘“ Morris.” 
8. “The Spanish Main was blown up in Havana harbor 
by the Spaniards.” 
The confusion here is obvious. 
4. “Wampum is something like a wigwam.” 
5. “A trust is an organization supposed to be entirely 
reliable in every way.” 
6. “In 1692 Benjamin Franklin discovered that light- 
ning was electricity worked by friction.” 
The foregoing was an answer given to the question : 
“What of witchcraft in 1692?” 
7. “George Calvert was the founder of the Calvinists.” 
8. “Sulla was a great general and leader of the nobles 
during the strife between the Plebeians and the Patri- 
archs.” 
9. “We should see the seven hills upon which Rome is 
built, the Palatine, Aventine, Quirinal, etc.; also the 
Appian Way, one of the main thoroughfares. Famous 
buildings seen would be the Parthenon, temple to all the
-P-A-G-E-217
WHY SOME PUPILS FAIL ON EXAMINATIONS 205 
gods, Circus Maximus, the temple to the goddess Athene, 
etc.” 
Pupils frequently confuse the Parthenon and the 
Pantheon. 
10. ‘“‘George Mason helped to draw up the boundary 
line between Dixie and Mason.” 
11. ‘Wat Tylor was a great historian.” 
The pupil who wrote this answer probably lived 
near Williamsburg, Virginia. 
12. “John Hampten: a great minister in the Hampten 
Court Conference.” 
Mt. Vernon was put in Vermont probably because 
of the suggestion contained in “ Ver”; Vicksburg 
in “ Mass.” because of the clutch that ‘ Miss.” 
had once made; and for some such reasons, too, 
many pupils have said that Mt. Vernon was Washing- 
ton’s birthplace. 
In a certain book it is stated that the bishops 
who refused to acknowledge Elizabeth’s supremacy 
in the church lost their sees. Unlucky suggestion 
made a young lady who was asked to explain the 
statement say, ‘‘ They lost their eyes.” 
A particular thing that almost invariably gives 
trouble is ‘strict’ and ‘loose ”’ construction. It 
is so natural to associate “ strictness ” with strength 
in the Federal authority that the average pupil will 
aver that the strict constructionists wanted to give  
-P-A-G-E-218
    206 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
all the power possible to the national government, 
and that the loose constructionists wanted a weak 
national government. 
Sometimes these unlucky confusions blossom into 
real wit — innocent wit, no doubt. For example, 
one pupil wrote: ‘A protective tariff is a tax 
on incomes.’ Another said, ‘General Bee was 
a general who made a bee line to Boston to 
aid Washington.” Of course it was a young 
lady who wrote of the Concord Hymn as the 
“Conquered Him.” ‘“ What was the Sherman 
Act?” was answered thus: ‘‘ Marching through 
Georgia.” ! 
5. “Innocency of words.” — Herein we find a 
prolific cause of failure on examinations — and on 
everything else. When a pupil writes ‘ Jackson’s 
policy of civil service was that no one should go 
into the war who had not good health and was 
trained,” we sigh in real despair and exclaim, ‘“‘ What 
innocency!” Such childlike (or childish) simplicity 
regarding the meaning of common words in our 
mother tongue is indeed painful. It might be amus- 
ing if it were found in only a few cases; but it 
appears so often that it is really distressing. Here 
are other examples :— 
1 The last example appeared on a history paper that I received 
in the summer of 1910. Shortly afterward it gained rather 
wide currency through the “‘funny page’’ of a popular magazine. 
I was not responsible for the publicity given it at that time.
-P-A-G-E-219
WHY SOME PUPILS FAIL ON EXAMINATIONS 207 
1. “Charlemagne was the founder of the Dooms day 
book.” 
2. “A noted French discoverer was Champlain who 
founded Lake Champlain.” 
3. ‘The tobacco rebellion was when they brought it 
from England and over here and showed the people over 
here how to raise tobacco.” 
4. “The Erie Canal was discovered in 1765.” 
Innocency of words usually means poverty of 
ideas. For example, notice how a single adjective 
seems to fill the world for the pupil who, to a question 
regarding thecharacter of certain kings, writes thus : — 
“Charles I was a good king. 
“Charles II was a good king. 
“John was not a good king. 
“ Alfred was a good king. 
“ Alfred II was not a very good king. 
“Edward I was a good king.” 
Innocency of words and poverty of ideas frequently 
seize upon the phraseology of the question in the vain 
effort to express themselves. That is to say, the 
pupil, in his attempt at an answer, merely says over 
what the teacher has said in the question itself, and 
complacently imagines that he has answered the 
question, or at least said something. Here is an 
example. 
Question: “Show definitely why it is necessary for 
the teacher of history to be familiar with the subject 
matter in order to be skillful in method.”
-P-A-G-E-220
  208 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
Answer: “The teacher must be familiar with subject 
matter in order to teach history successfully.” 
This is an actual case, and the answer is more or 
less typical of a large class. It is such fatal innocency 
as this that enables the pupil to say over the words 
of his lesson without seeing what they mean; to 
listen to the teacher in the class room without under- 
standing what he says; and to write answers (?) to 
examination questions without knowing that he has 
said practically nothing or something that is absurd 
upon its own face. 
6. Indiscriminate reading. — By indiscriminate 
reading I mean reading without marking meanings 
and differences. Beginning in the first grade, and 
continuing therefrom, the child naturally endeavors 
to read with thoughtfulness and understanding; and 
his teachers all along the line should be able to 
strengthen his effort in this respect. To read prop- 
erly is to interpret speech and td lay hold of the 
treasures others would give us. Even in the first 
grade, imagination and thought may be quickened 
and developed in the reading process; and if the 
child reaches the grammar school without being able 
to see wondrous forms and vital relationships through 
printed words, his teachers must be charged with 
incompetence or negligence. But placing the re- 
sponsibility upon them will not relieve him of the 
resulting handicap. 
This indiscriminate reading, such as too often 
 
-P-A-G-E-221
  
WHY SOME PUPILS FAIL ON EXAMINATIONS 209 
handicaps the pupil in the upper grades and in the 
high school, is due to poor training and bad habit 
rather than to deficient intelligence. Lack of at- 
tention to detail is a phase of the American habit 
of haste and halfwayness. It is this habit that 
breaks up our nerves and robs us of many an excel- 
lence. We do not fully appreciate the fact that the 
difference between mediocrity and excellence con- 
sists only of small points — of slight touches. We 
try to grasp things wholesale rather than in detail. 
We learn to read and spell on words and sen- 
tences, and get blind spots for letters and commas. 
We buy a coat without trying the buttons, and a 
house without inspecting the locks and latches. We 
gulp a book a page at a time; we guess the con- 
tents of the newspaper from the headlines; we 
estimate a man’s consequence by the size of his 
automobile; we build a tower without testing the 
foundation ; we try to lift society without touching 
the individual. 
The boy in school has caught the fashion. He 
sweeps his glance over the examination question 
as a whole, and misses altogether or fails to mark 
the crucial words. He dashes down an answer, 
never taking the pains to see whether it will fit the 
question or not. He must hurry on to the next. 
Innocency of words and indiscriminate reading 
are of course intimately related, but a distinction 
may be made. In the former the pupil does not know 
r
-P-A-G-E-222
  210 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
what the words mean; in the latter he does not take 
the pains to note carefully the meanings that might 
be plain to him. 
“What are you hauling? ’’ I said one day to a 
little boy with red cheeks and a new express wagon. 
He replied, ‘‘ Out at de Normal School,” and seemed 
well pleased with himself. 
“Who was John Marshall? ’’ I wrote on the black- 
board the next day, in giving a quiz to the history 
class ; and this is what a young lady wrote in answer : 
“ John Marshall was born at Germantown, in 1755. 
He was educated at home until he began studying 
law.” 
The little boy was an indiscriminate hearer. He 
either misunderstood the question, or failed to 
perceive that “ what ’’ cannot be answered as if it 
were “where.” The young lady was an indis- 
criminate reader. She did not see that “ who” 
does not call for place, time, or process. Such 
words as “ what,’’ “who,” ‘“ where,” “ when,” 
“why,” and “ how ” are like index fingers, pointing 
the mind to highways of thought ; but many a pupil 
passes them heedlessly. It is as if he should walk 
into a strange city without noting or heeding the 
street names, the door numbers, the motorman’s 
gong, or the policeman’s signal. 
What are some of the lessons from all these things 
for the teacher and the school official, as well as for 
the pupil?
-P-A-G-E-223
  WHY SOME PUPILS FAIL ON EXAMINATIONS 211 
1. The pupil needs more time for the mastery of 
history. 
2. The appreciative understanding of English is 
necessary to the successful study of history or any- 
thing else in which the pupil must get many facts 
from books. : 
3. The pupil must be taught to observe carefully 
and to pay due regard to detail. Careless reading 
or slipshod statements, either in speech or in writing, 
should not be tolerated. 
4. The teacher should take special pains to dis- 
tinguish names and terms that are so much alike 
as to lead readily to confusion. 
5. If the examination is counted as a vital factor 
in determining the pupil’s standing, he should be 
given training in the answering of such questions as 
he will have to answer on examination, in order that 
some of his bad habits may be corrected against 
the fateful day. And he needs practice in written 
expression. If he is required to give only oral an- 
swers during the term, he can hardly be:expected to 
do himself justice in a written test at the end of the 
term.! 
1In the History Teacher’s Magazine, November, 1913, is an 
interesting article by Edgar Dawson entitled, ‘‘Mortality in 
History Examinations and its Causes.”

CHAPTER XIX 
MAKING AND USING HISTORY QUESTIONS 
Every teacher of history will of course use ques- 
tions, and should use many of them, oral and 
written. The intelligent child, if interested, will 
ask questions, ad infinitum; and he in turn should 
be called upon to answer a great many, even from 
the first grade. The teacher aims at impression, 
through stories, pictures, objects, and exemplary 
action ; but he must also demand expression, through 
the retelling of stories, the making of pictures and 
objects, imitative and imaginative action, and 
through the frequent answering of questions. 
Beginning in the last grades or in the high school, 
the teacher may gradually adopt the lecture in place 
of the story, and use that predominantly in the col- 
lege, the normal school, and the university. In 
parallel procedure, the pupil may gradually cease 
his deliberate echoing of- the teacher’s voice in song 
and story, and try instead to speak of and for him- 
self in oral and written reports, in formal essays, 
and in debates; but all the way through, even to 
the last examination for the Doctor’s degree, the 
world of the teacher and the student is full of ques- 
212
-P-A-G-E-225
MAKING AND USING HISTORY QUESTIONS 213 
tions, questions, questions, uttered and unuttered, 
answered and unanswered. 
“ Where ?’’ isthe question of geography ; “When?” 
is the question of chronology; ‘‘ Who?” is the 
question of biography and genealogy; ‘‘ What?” 
is the question of chemistry and literature ; ‘‘ How?” 
is the question of sociology as well as of mathematics 
and mechanics; ‘“‘ Why?” is the question of phi- 
losophy; ‘‘ Whence?” and ‘“‘ Whither?” are the 
questions of biology and religion; but history needs 
them all. 
“Where?” leads us to the place of wondrous 
story; ‘‘ When?” ascertains the year and the day 
of the great event; ‘‘ Who?” points to every noble 
man and woman in every age; “ What?” seeks 
knowledge of every vital relation and every notable 
deed; ‘‘ How?” observes processes and searches 
for the secrets of mastery and skill; ‘“ Why?” 
demands a reason for every thought and act; 
“Whence? ”’ seeks for origins and beginnings; and 
“Whither? ”’ has regard to tendency and destiny. 
The history teacher, in the instruction and ex- 
amination of his classes, may put his questions in 
speech or in writing; but naturally most of them 
will be oral, especially in the elementary schools. 
All questions should be stated clearly and as concisely 
as possible; and in oral work a constant effort 
should be made to have them definite, pointed, and 
brief. When a question is written down the pupil 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
} 
214 HOW TO ace AMERICAN HISTORY 
can usually take as much time as may be necessary 
to look it over; but when it comes flying upon the 
wings of the wind, and has to be caught upon the 
senses and held in memory while the same powers 
and others are searching the world for an answer, 
it should, in the interests of mercy as well+as of 
pedagogy, be stated in a few words that have a dis- 
tinct meaning. 
In order to set forth certain qualities in questions, 
some good, so bad, a number of examples are 
herewith presented. All these examples have been 
copied, word for word, from standard textbooks on 
United States history. 
Here are several that certainly are embarrassing 
by reason of their length :— 
“What has entitled Marquette, Joliet, and La Salle 
to their fame and to the gratitude, not only of French 
Canadians, but of all Americans?” 
“How did Benjamin Franklin try to create a common 
interest and responsibility in all the colonies in this big 
land quarrel?” 
“What were some of the results for good and for evil 
arising from the indirect relations becoming prevalent 
between employers and laborers?” 
                If these questions were used only in written or 
printed form, to be answered in writing, they might 
be tolerable; but if they are for oral use, they are 
certainly not good. They may properly be termed 
“ cumbersome.” To cumber is to burden, to hamper.
-P-A-G-E-227
  MAKING AND USING HISTORY QUESTIONS 215 
The very size and involved character of these ques- 
tions would cumber the student while he is groping 
and struggling for an answer. If fast on paper, they 
are bad enough; if fired out orally by a nervous 
teacher, they are altogether impossible to the average 
pupil! They should be split or chopped into thinner 
or shorter pieces, and the pieces well pointed. 
The temptation to fire a double-barrel gun or a 
repeating rifle seems often too much for the teacher ; 
and so we are annihilated by such fusillades as the 
above or cut in two by such chain-shot as the 
following :— 
“What is said of the life in cities and on plantations?” 
“Name the two cities most active in carrying on trade 
between Europe and the Far East, and tell how this 
traffic was threatened in the fourteenth century.” 
“What were the platform and candidates of the Republi- 
cans in 1884?” 
Each of these questions should be dissected and 
reconstructed. As to the first, one certainly would 
think that life in cities is worth a question for itself 
alone. The answer, to be at all satisfactory, would 
necessarily be rather long. Just as properly, a 
question could be devoted wholly to plantation life. 
The second example also would be much better as 
two questions, with the division made at the comma 
after ‘Far East.” 
The third example is worst of all. If the pupil 
is able to state the national platform of a great
-P-A-G-E-228
   
       216 HOW TO ACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
  party, he surely o 
and be compli 
“Who were the ght to be allowed time for breath, 
   andidates?”’? But as propounded 
the question is a violation of good form as well as 
a sin against childhood. In trying to swamp the 
pupil in the subtleties of politics, the teacher drowns 
himself in his own English. See what he really says: 
“What were the candidates?” 
     
        How could any one say, even if he could tell who 
they were? Obviously, the teacher in this case 
intended to ask only who they were, but he sacrificed 
sense in order to economize words. The chances 
are that most the cumbersome questions found 
in books are largely the result of an ill-advised effort 
to save paper and printer’s ink. But if the questions 
that slip into standard books are thus and so, what 
must be true of thousands that are never tried at 
Here are two more examples of questions of such 
great content that they ought to be divided :— 
“What objections were raised even by wise men, and 
what mistakes had Columbus made in his calculations?” 
“In general, what conditions in the old world made so 
many people dissatisfied there, and what conditions in 
the new world drew so many to its shores?” 
If such questions are overwhelming in their magni- 
tude, the following are apt to take the pupil’s breath 
away by the rapidity of their dancing variety :—
-P-A-G-E-229
MAKING AND USING HISTORY QUESTIONS 217 
“Why, how, and when did Fort Sumter fall?” 
“When, why, and where did the Swedes begin to settle 
in America?” 
“Where, when, why, and by whom was the Line of De- 
marcation established ?” 
These questions, please remember, are all in the 
books. Pray, let us leave them there. If we use 
them in the class room, let us break them up and ad- 
minister them a piece at a time. In comic drama 
they may serve a good purpose entire. They remind 
us of the downpour of interrogations that fell all 
at once upon the defenseless head of Cinna the Poet, 
in the hour when Cesar died :— 
“What is your name, whither are you going, where do 
you dwell, are you a married man or a bachelor? Answer 
every man directly, ay, and briefly, ay, and wisely, ay, 
and truly.” 
In framing questions the teacher should be care- 
ful to choose words with clear-cut meaning and to 
put words and phrases in their proper places. Here 
are some illustrations of failures in these respects : — 
“Did the fear of British arms by European nations 
make these colonies more secure from Dutch, Spanish, or 
French attack in America?” 
“What was the new law concerning the counting of the 
electoral vote passed in 1887?” 
In the first example the word “‘arms”’ is of indefi- 
nite meaning. Probably it is used to mean the 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  218 HOW TO i AMERICAN HISTORY 
British military power; but the pupil might nat- 
urally suppose that it means rifles or pistols or swords. 
In the second example the arrangement of the 
parts of the sentence stands in the way of clear 
meaning. Written down, and punctuated thus, 
it would possibly be clear : — 
“What was the new law, concerning the counting of the 
electoral vote, passed in 1887?” 
But if this question were spoken, it might still be 
misleading or confusing. Would it not be better 
thus ? 
“What was the new law, passed in 1887, concerning the 
counting of the electoral vote?” 
Clearness and definiteness are not always best 
secured by conciseness and brevity. Note the 
following question : — 
“How was the national debt reduced from 1801 to 
1811?” 
Despite absurdities and impossibilities, somebody 
would take this question literally, and try to reduce 
1801 to 1811. In such a case it would probably 
be advisable to put in another word or two, and make 
the question stand thus :— 
“How was the national debt reduced during the period 
from 1801 to 1811?” 
There are some questions that may well be termed 
“questions of complacency.” The questioner is
-P-A-G-E-231
  MAKING AND USING HISTORY QUESTIONS 219 
evidently well satisfied with himself, just as he is. 
He shuts one eye to ask the question, and he expects 
the pupil to shut one eye to answer it. Here are 
some examples : — 
“Why did the Monitor beat the Merrimac?” 
“What French names still remain where these settle- 
ments were made?” 
“What four causes led up to this panic?” 
In the first of these the questioner is apparently 
shutting his eye to this: “ Did the Monitor beat the 
Merrimac?” which is still a question with a good 
many persons. 
In the second example it is implied that one may 
readily list all the French names that still remain 
around the Great Lakes and in the Mississippi 
Valley, an implication that can hardly be allowed. 
The question would mean more and be more true 
stated thus :— 
“What are some of the French names that still remain 
where these settlements were made?” 
In the third example is a similar implication. The 
panic of 1837 perhaps had more than four causes. 
It is a mistake to allow a child to get the notion that, 
when he has mentioned certain familiar things, 
he has exhausted all possibilities in the matter. 
Because of such misimpressions many children sup- 
pose that “ taxation without representation ” was 
the sole cause of the American Revolution. 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
220 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
Questions that suggest unmistakably their own 
answers are not worth much. Here are some of this 
sort :— : 
“Was it necessary to make the paper notes legal tender ?”” 
“Was it easy to decide whether to be a patriot or a 
loyalist ?”” 
A good guesser would be pretty certain of hitting 
either one of these, although the second seems to 
call for more thought than the first. 
Here is a question that looks like a boomerang :— 
“When an attack upon the South along the coast failed, 
how did the British attempt to attack the colonies in the 
rear?” 
It seems to fly back into your face about the time 
you are getting ready to say something. In other 
words, the last phrase of the question seems to 
contain the answer. Just what it means, or is in- 
tended to call forth, I do not know. I only know 
that it is found in a standard textbook, and I fear 
that many teachers of history are employing it or 
others just as bad. 
It is not necessary that every question be startling 
or striking, any more than it is necessary for the 
landscape to be all peaks and mountain ranges. 
We have need of the commonplace in education 
just as in the landscape and in life. For example, 
the first questions about any subject or topic may 
naturally be simple, or deal with simple phases of

the subject; those that demand more penetrating 
or more summary answers may just as naturally 
come later. Nothing herein is to be construed, 
however, as meaning that the teacher shall not, if 
he choose, use a striking or startling question as 
the very first in a series for the purpose of arousing 
attention. 
Not all questions in a series need to be of equal 
importance. In fact, it would be impossible to make 
them all of equal importance if they refer consistently 
to the different phases of the subject; for obviously 
the different phases of every subject are of different 
degrees of interest and value. Some very common- 
place questions may serve a good purpose in calling 
for commonplace facts which, although they are not 
of tremendous significance, ought to be known. 
Some questions should call for facts — make a 
demand upon the stores of memory; some should 
call for a process of thought — make a demand upon 
the reasoning powers; some should stimulate the 
imagination, and hence all the powers of mind and 
heart; some should call, as it were, for the pupil 
himself: demand an act of choice and volition, thus 
requiring a subjective response rather than an ob- 
jective possession. Every question should present 
a contest to the pupil, in which he must take hand. 
He may sit quiet and passive — perhaps indifferent 
— under the teacher’s lecture, but the question leaps 
up before him with a challenge, and he must become
-P-A-G-E-234
  222 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
at once active, or be classed as a dodger or even as 
a coward. Even if he fail to answer correctly, he 
may still meet the challenge courageously. 
The question with its answer opens the gate to 
the pupil’s thought and soul, and lets the teacher 
look in. It should do so. It should reveal lacks 
and needs as well as riches and resources. The 
question and the answer are an exchange of ac- 
quaintance between master and disciple — a bond 
of sympathy and friendship. Good questioning 
marks the good teacher just as much as good an- 
swering marks the good pupil. Questions are keys 
to knowledge as well as to souls. They stand con- 
tinually before the gates of thought, knocking for 
audience, like messengers from strange lands. 
Here is a list of questions that illustrate very well 
the desirable qualities of brevity, definiteness, and 
directness. They also form a logical series, one 
question following another naturally. 
1. ‘What was a ‘writ of assistance’ ?”’ 
2. “Why did the colonists oppose the Stamp Act?” 
3. “What was done by the Stamp Act Congress?” 
4. “Show some of the forms of opposition to the 
stamps.” 
5. “Tell why the repeal of the Stamp Act was not 
complete.” 
6. “How did Pitt’s illness hasten the Revolution?” 
7. “Describe Townshend’s threefold plan for taxing 
America.”
-P-A-G-E-235
  MAKING AND USING HISTORY QUESTIONS 223 
8. “Of what use was the Adams circular letter?” 
9. “Why was the tea tax a blunder?” 
10. “How did the colonials learn of each other’s 
plans?”’? 
Such questions test the pupil’s knowledge of the 
text. They call for facts known or to be known — 
objective realities, possessed or to be possessed. 
They seem to make their chief demand upon the 
memory, but they also stimulate the imagination 
and provoke thought. 
In the following questions, particularly in No. 3 
and No. 5, a strong call is made upon the pupil 
himself. They seek a response in character. Their 
aim is subjective development rather than objective 
acquirement. 
1. “What is bribery?” 
2. ‘What shapes may it take?” 
3. ‘What is there wrong about it?” 
4. “What instances of bribery, or attempted bribery, 
are there in American history ?” 
5. “Why is it an insult to an honest man to offer him 
a bribe?” ? 
The subjective value of the following ques- 
tions is obvious. They make an appeal to choice 
and volition upon the basis of knowledge and 
reason.

“Would you have been a Federalist or a Republican 
in Washington’s time?” 
“Give reasons for your answer.” ! 
The teacher, especially the young teacher, had 
better formulate his questions and reduce them to 
writing before meeting his class. Impromptu ques- 
tions are apt to be defective in form, illogical, and 
badly distributed. Use your own questions with 
the class in preference to those in the book. The 
latter are excellent in preparing for class work. 
Your lesson plan should include your question list, 
and you should make at least so much of the lesson 
plan every day.?

CHAPTER XX 
GRADING QUIZ PAPERS AND EXAMINATION 
PAPERS 
In essence the written quiz, the written test, and 
the written examination are the same. The dif- 
ferences consist largely in the terms. In usage, 
however, the examination is ordinarily a longer and 
more formal exercise, coming at the end of a quarter 
or a session; while the test or quiz may be given 
monthly, weekly, or at irregular intervals. The 
test, or the quiz, is used not only for the instruction 
of the pupil, but also to enable the teacher to gauge 
the pupil’s progress and to determine his class stand- 
ing. Grades made on tests, or class grades deter- 
mined by tests and otherwise, should be combined 
with the grade of the final examination and with his 
other grades, to arrive at a fair estimate of the pu- 
pil’s knowledge, ability, and growth. 
Professor R. H. Dabney, head of the history de- 
partment of the University of Virginia, makes a 
daily use of the written quiz in certain of his classes. 
He has been following this plan for a number of 
years and has found it attended with most excellent 
results. Each day, when the class meets for the 
@ 225
-P-A-G-E-238
  226 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
hour lecture period, the first ten minutes are devoted 
to the written quiz. Only two, three, or four ques- 
tions are given; they are on the day’s lesson; and 
they are always such as can be answered in the limited 
time. The papers handed in are carefully graded, 
and each man’s marks recorded against his name. 
At the end of the term the average grade from the 
daily tests is combined with the examination grade, 
one counting about as much as the other, and each 
being essential in the grade required for passing. 
In other words, if a student does not do reasonably 
well on both the daily tests and the final examina- 
tion, he cannot pass. He cannot atone for habitual 
negligence by a brilliant spurt at the end. On the 
other hand, if he does good work daily, he is practi- 
cally certain of the result, because the quiz each day 
is limited to the lesson of that day; and by preparing 
regularly each daily lesson he is making the best 
possible preparation for the final examination. Since 
Professor Dabney inaugurated this system several 
years ago he has been able to observe a marked im- 
provement in the work affected by it. A much larger 
proportion of men pass the courses now than formerly. 
Perhaps the most difficult work of all that falls 
upon the teacher of history is the grading of written 
answers to written questions. This sort of work 
is particularly difficult in history and kindred sub- 
jects. In mathematics or an exact science most of 
the questions put to pupils in the schools require
-P-A-G-E-239
  QUIZ PAPERS AND EXAMINATION PAPERS 227 
answers that are so fixed and definite that the teacher 
can say of each one at a glance, ‘‘ Correct” or 
“Tncorrect.”’ In history, on the other hand, and 
in all social sciences, many of the lines of fact are 
not yet clearly drawn, and very few are fixed by 
anything like universal agreement. In other words, 
while there is usually but one proper answer to a 
question in an exact science, there may often be in 
a social science a number of different answers, all 
of excellent merit. 
There are, of course, certain questionsin history and 
related subjects that have fixed and definite answers, 
as may readily be shown. Such answers the teacher 
can easily and quickly grade. Usually in such cases 
the value of an answer is either 100 or 0, and which 
it is can be at once determined, for it is a certain 
name, a fixed date, a definite fact, or a well-known 
quantity. Here are some examples of such ques- 
tions, with their answers : — 
1. Who was called the ‘‘Father of the Constitution” ? 
Answer: James Madison. 
2. When was Lincoln born? 
Answer: February 12, 1809. 
3. What important artificial waterway was opened from 
west to east in 1825? 
Answer: The Erie Canal. 
4. How much money did the United States give Snain 
for the Philippine Islands, etc. ? 
Answer: $20,000,000.
-P-A-G-E-240
228 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
Obviously each of these questions can have but 
one acceptable answer. All such questions, there- 
fore, will have answers that can at once be marked 
either at full value or at.zero. If the teacher wishes 
to have an easy time grading papers, or if she wishes 
to give the members of her class a first lesson in 
grading their own papers under her direction, she 
must be careful to ask just such questions. 
Not long ago I gave this question to a class in 
history :—     
    
                       
   1. (1) What important machine was invented in 1793? 
(2) Who was the inventor ? 
Here are some of the answers received, with the 
grades I gave them, each part of the question being 
accorded a maximum value of 50: — 
A. 1. (1) Cotton Gin. 50 
(2) Eli Whitney. 50 
B. 1. (1) The Cotton Gin. 50 
(2) Eli Whitney. 50 
This answer is complete and in good form. 
C. 1. (1) The cotton gin was invented in 1793. 50 
(2) Eli Whitney was the inventor. 50 
A needless lot of words are used here. 
D. 1. (1) The important machine invented in 1793 was 
the cotton gin. 50 
(2) The inventor was Eli Whitney. 50 
Here are more needless words.
-P-A-G-E-241
  
QUIZ PAPERS AND EXAMINATION PAPERS 229 
Although some of the foregoing answers are in 
better form than others, it is easy to see that all are 
the same in substance, and that all are substantially 
correct. It would be just as easy to see that answers 
different in substance from these would be alto- 
gether incorrect. 
But the good teacher of history wishes to ask 
many questions the answers to which cannot be 
stated so definitely or be disposed of so readily. 
As already remarked, many questions in history and 
related subjects admit of answers widely different 
in substance as well as in form. Any question that 
involves judgments from complex conditions, some 
of which are undetermined, or from more or less 
unsettled theories, is bound to have a different 
answer from every different thinker. These answers 
may agree essentially, differing only incidentally ; 
but they will differ in form of statement at least. 
Moreover, such a difference in form represents some 
difference in conception and appreciation, and hence 
in value. Some answers may agree in part with 
known facts or accepted conclusions, while disagree- 
ing in part. In such cases credit should be given 
for the part that is good, and a fair deduction of 
credit be made for the part that is not good. 
The term “ good” is here used rather than the 
term “ correct ” or “ right ’’; because in many ques- 
tions of the sort under consideration it will be pos- 
sible to get a number of good answers, but perhaps
-P-A-G-E-242
    230 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
impossible to get one that could properly be termed 
the right one or the correct one. To use the term 
“right” or “ correct’ would imply that there is 
but one acceptable answer, which is not true. 
Who, now, is to evaluate all these differing state- 
ments (answers) about different persons, forces, move- 
ments, and institutions, concerning all of whom or 
which.there are so many different opinions deserving 
respect, and so many different things that are true? 
The teacher must do it. The teacher, therefore, 
has a hard task. To perform it well he needs many 
powers and qualifications: Broad knowledge, pene- 
trating insight, cosmopolitanism, or power of sym- 
pathy and adjustment, strict regard for fact, and 
judicial fairness. 
To illustrate the variety of answers that may be 
expected in many cases, and to indicate the different 
values that may be assigned to certain answers, 
more examples are herewith submitted. This ques- 
tion was given to a large class along with the one 
concerning Eli Whitney and the cotton gin; and 
the answers here reproduced are stated literally 
as they were given by different pupils in the class. 
2. (1) Who was John Marshall ? 
(2) How did he make his greatest contribution to 
American history ? 
In grading the answers to this question a maximum 
value of 40 was determined upon for the first part 
 
-P-A-G-E-243
  QUIZ PAPERS AND EXAMINATION PAPERS 231 
and 60 for the second part. Here are some of the 
answers and their respective grades :— 
A. 2. (1) A jurist. 35 
Not specific enough. 
(2) While Chief Justice of the United States he estab- 
lished precendents in the Constitution which have re- 
mained so ever since. 50 
A word misspelled. He did more than establish 
precedents. 
B. 2. (1) John Marshall was Chief-justice of the 
United States. 38 
Not explicit enough. Form not the best. 
(2) John Marshall was a member of the House of 
Burgesses. He interpreted the Constitution. 50 
He was not a member of the House of Burgesses, 
but of the Virginia legislature. 
C. 2. (1) John Marshall was the son of Colonel Thomas 
Marshall. 30 
Not a good identification. 
(2) The great contribution Marshall made to the Ameri- 
can History was the interpretation of the constitution. 50 
“The American History” suggests a book. 
“ Constitution ” not capitalized is indefinite. 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
  232 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
D. 2. (1) John Marshall was a Virginian. He became 
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the U.S. 39 
“U.S.” here is not good form. 
(2) John Marshall interpreted the constitution in such 
a way that the meaning of it could be understood by the 
people. He also took a leading part in trying to get US 
to adopt the Constitution. 40 
“US” probably means the United States, but 
the statement would be more applicable to Virginia. 
E. 2. (1) John Martial was the Chief Justice of US. 
He served for 35 years. 35 
Five points off for bad spelling and bad form. 
(2) He added several things to the Constitution that 
are taken to-day as a precident. 25 
Bad spelling and inaccurate statement, but some 
truth expressed. 
F. 2. (1) John Marshall was a lawyer, and the first 
chief justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. 30 
He was not the first chief justice. John Jay, John 
Rutledge, and Oliver Ellsworth preceded him. 
(2) He expounded and explained the Constitution. He 
added many things to it that are still in existence. 45 
“ And explained ” is repetition. He added nothing 
to the Constitution literally, though he did add much 
potentially.
-P-A-G-E-245
    QUIZ PAPERS AND EXAMINATION PAPERS 233 
G. 2. (1) John Marshall was Chief Justice of the Su- 
preme Court. 35 
“ Supreme Court ” of what? 
(2) The distinction of securing the adoption of the 
Constitution by Virginia was due chiefly to Marshall. 
He also made the Constitution clear enough (for the first 
time) that the national government might be under- 
stood. 55 
H. 2. (1) John Marshall was one of the world’s 
greatest jurists. He was chief justice of the U. S. for 
thirty-four years. 37 
(2) He made his greatest contribution to American 
history by expounding the Constitution in terms that are 
often used at present, and by making many constitutional 
decisions which have influenced the present day. 59 
“ Which have had an influence to the present day ”” 
would be more exact. 
I. 2. (1) John Marshall was born a Virginian. He 
was a distinguished statesman and was Justice of Supreme 
Court for thirty-four years. 35 
“ Justice” is inaccurate and “‘ Supreme Court ” 
is indefinite. The latter expression might readily 
be understood as meaning the supreme court of 
Virginia. 
(2) His most noticeable service was in the interpret- 
ing and expounding the Constitution. The influence of 
his decisions and interpretations are felt to-day. 59 
“ And expounding ”’ seems to be repetition. 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
    234 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
J. 2. (1) A great American jurist; chief justice of the 
U.S. Supreme Court, 1801-1835. 40 
(2) By his profound interpretation of the Constitution 
and his momentous decisions in accordance therewith. 
He won respect for the Court, and set precedents that have 
fixed national policy and perhaps national destiny. 60 
Examples could be multiplied. Obviously, each 
case must be dealt with individually, upon its merits. 
Not many rules can be given. The matter in every 
instance depends upon the teacher— upon the 
knowledge and good judgment that he is able to 
make bear upon it. Students preparing to be 
teachers, especially students in our normal schools, 
should have some training in the grading of papers, 
along with other things helpful and necessary to 
their skill and trustworthiness.!

CHAPTER XXI 
THE USE AND THE ABUSE OF DATES 
Dates seem to be the disturbing factor in history 
study; yet if dates were left out of history, every- 
thing would be disturbed and in hopeless confu- 
sion. 
When a pupil imagines that history consists 
merely of so many dates to be memorized, he is mis- 
taken. When he says, ‘I can’t learn history be- 
cause I can’t remember dates,’’ he is probably mis- 
taken twice: first, in supposing that history consists 
only of dates; second, in asserting that he cannot 
remember dates. 
Young ladies, especially, are prone to imagine 
that they cannot remember dates. They are much 
mistaken. Nearly every girl and nearly every 
woman has special gifts for remembering dates. 
Who ever heard of a young lady who forgot a friend’s 
birthday? or a “ date” for the opera, even though 
fixed a month in advance, to the day, the hour, and 
the minute? or the date of her approaching wedding, 
though set two years in advance? What woman 
has ever forgot a wedding day or a birthday, though 
a score of years in the past? Women are really 
235
-P-A-G-E-248
  236 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
geniuses in remembering dates. If they can only 
find half the interest in historical dates that they 
have, and have rightfully, in personal dates, the 
whole matter will be easy for them. 
When a teacher makes it appear that dates are 
history or the essence of history, he is abusing 
history. When he asserts that dates are the source 
of all his woes in the teaching of history, he is abusing 
dates. When he tries to make the child learn all 
the dates in the chronicle, he is abusing the child. 
Let us consider dates in their true light. In books 
a large number of dates are necessary, and they 
ought to be at the right places, in plain type. In 
heads at least a few dates are necessary, and they 
ought to be just as clear and well placed as those in 
the books. In both books and heads dates serve 
as guides, with index fingers, pointing both ways: 
back into the prolific past, forward into the promising 
future. Changing the figure, we may think of the 
system of historical dates as the skeleton that is 
necessary for a perfect body, keeping all things in 
place, giving strength, and making possible use- 
fulness and beauty. 
Once more, dates in history are like the stars in 
the heavens. They shine out of the darkness, 
showing place, relation, and interrelation. A few 
are of the first magnitude; the others are less in 
rank by reason of smaller circumstances, or less in 
brilliancy by reason of greater distances. We do
-P-A-G-E-249
    THE USE AND THE ABUSE OF DATES 237 
not attempt to learn all the stars by name — the 
great majority, perhaps, are nameless; but we do 
name a few of the chief ones, and learn to know 
them. In the world of time, as in the world of space, 
we need to name and know only the great fixed stars 
—there are no temporal planets. The innumerable 
lesser dots upon the expanse of the ages may be al- 
lowed to fade gradually out of our consciousness, 
save here and there a path of light — a Clio’s milky 
way. 
It would be wrong for the teacher of history to 
regard all dates as of equal importance, or to allow 
his pupils to do so. It would be harmful and foolish 
for him to demand of his class that they remember 
every date. He should not only know that dates 
differ in value, but he should also know which partic- 
ular dates are of most importance; and as he goes 
through a book with his pupils he should occasion- 
ally direct attention to this date or that, and show 
its significance. At the same time, or at some time, 
he should call upon his pupils to exercise their own 
judgment in the selection of important dates. 
There are two or three reasons why people forget 
dates. Perhaps there are four. In the first place, 
lack of interest in a date makes it harder to remember. 
But the chief reason why pupils in school and people 
generally forget dates is this: They have never 
learned them thoroughly. It is one thing to play 
at learning dates; it is another thing to grind them
-P-A-G-E-250
238 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
into memory as into granite. When a boy learns 
a list of dates as thoroughly as some of us years ago 
had to learn the multiplication table, or as thor- 
oughly as most persons are expected to learn their 
own names and the names of their friends, he will 
not soon forget it. If dates are thoroughly learned 
and occasionally used they will not often be forgotten. 
We discredit the memory too much nowadays, and 
hence fail to realize full value from it in many 
cases. 
Another reason why people forget dates, or never 
learn them thoroughly, is found in the fact, already 
suggested, that no definite selection of important 
dates is made for special study. Instead, a half 
chance is taken at all the dates in the book, indis- 
criminately, and this usually means failure to fix 
any of them permanently. 
The. reasons why history dates are forgotten, 
therefore, may be put in summary form, as follows : — 
1. Lack of interest in them. 
2. Lack of thoroughness in learning them. 
3. Lack of means for using them. 
4. Failure to discriminate between important and 
non-important dates. 
In like manner, the rules for learning and remember- 
ing dates may be summarized thus :— 
1. Select a limited number of the most important 
dates. 
_ 2. Learn them thoroughly. 
 
-P-A-G-E-251
  THE USE AND THE ABUSE OF DATES 239 
3. Devise some means for using or recalling them 
occasionally. 
4, Endeavor to appreciate the interest and signifi- 
cance of each date studied. 
The teacher may do well to select twenty or 
thirty or forty of the most important dates in 
American history for his class, and have each pupil 
copy the list in his notebook. He may do better 
still by having each pupil take part in making the 
selection. Let us suppose that you are near the end 
of your textbook. You have pointed out, from time 
to time, certain dates with emphasis. You say :— 
“We shall now select the most important dates 
mentioned in our textbook, and make a list of them 
for our notebooks and our memories. During the 
next three days each one of you will make an inde- 
pendent selection of twenty dates, and arrange 
them in chronological order, writing after each date, 
in concise form, the event or events distinguishing it. 
The fourth day you will bring your lists to class. 
We shall then compare the different dates, discuss 
them, and select the twenty that meet with general 
approval. This approved list will be written upon 
the blackboard to give all of you an opportunity to 
copy it.” 
In learning dates the principle of association may 
be utilized to excellent advantage in many instances. 
It is indeed remarkable how many coincidences 
there are in dates which make association easy and 
 
-P-A-G-E-252
    240 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
helpful. For example, let us see how many impor- 
tant events are associated in the year 1619, in the 
Virginia colony. 
1619, in the Virginia colony :— 
First elected legislature 
First shipload of wives 
First shipload of slaves 
First shipload of tobacco exported 
First university planned for America 
The year 1689 affords another striking illustration. 
1689, a notable year : — 
Bill of Rights agreed upon in England 
Andros overthrown in New England 
Frontenac sent to Canada as governor 
French and English begin the fight for 
America 
April 19 is a fateful day in several centuries. 
April 19, an eventful day in American history : — 
1619: Sir George Yeardley arrives at James- 
town 
1689 : Boston overthrows Andros 
1775: First battle of the Revolution, at Lexing- 
ton 
1861: First bloodshed of the Civil War, at 
Baltimore
-P-A-G-E-253
    THE USE AND THE ABUSE OF DATES 241 
Fate has certainly been kind to the feeble memory. 
Here is another example, chosen from many. 
1807, a memorable year : — 
Fulton’s steamboat proved 
The Embargo passed 
Act of Congress forbidding importation of 
slaves passed 
Burr tried for treason 
Robert E. Lee born 
Different years that are marked by notable events 
may often be linked together by striking similarities. 
They often fall at intervals of ten, twenty, or fifty 
years, or an even century. Note the following 
examples : —

     CHAPTER XXII 
THE VALUE OF NATIONAL AND STATE SONGS 
ONE summer morning a few years ago, soon after 
the doors of the National Museum at Washington 
were opened, the attendants in charge and the few 
early visitors present were suddenly attracted, 
perhaps somewhat startled, by a burst of song that 
came from behind one of the tall cabinets. It was a 
patriotic song, full of devotion and the spirit of youth. 
If any one had looked upon the singing as unconven- 
tional and disturbing, he hardly would have dared to 
say so. To have stopped the song by violence would 
have been like tearing down the national colors. A 
group of history students, with their teacher, had 
come on an excursion to the national capital. An 
evening or two before they had listened to the United 
States Marine Band concert on the White House 
lawn, and had stood up with the vast throng when 
the national anthem was played. The next day they 
had stood under the great flagstaff at Arlington, and 
had seen the house of Francis Scott Key in George- 
town. At this very time they were bound for Mt. 
Vernon, and were utilizing the hour till the steamer 
should start by a pause at the Museum. In 
244     
-P-A-G-E-257
        VALUE OF NATIONAL AND STATE SONGS 245 
the history class at home they had just recently 
reviewed the British advance upon Washington 
and Baltimore in 1814, and the conditions under 
which Key had written the stirring lines that have 
made his name immortal. As part of the class 
exercise in that study the anthem itself had been 
learned and sung. Can any one be surprised, 
then, that this band of students, full of patriotic 
spirit, and heavy-laden with old stories made new, 
should have rushed eagerly up into a close group be- 
fore that huge cabinet in the National Museum, and 
burst out singing “The Star-Spangled Banner,” 
when they saw there before them the identical old 
banner that floated over Fort McHenry in 1814 and 
inspired the writing of the song? 
There it was, a great Old Glory, a huge flag, thirty- 
two feet long and twenty-seven feet wide — big 
enough to cover Baltimore in a storm of fire, and big 
enough to wave every day over a free and happy land. 
The “broad stripes ”’ on it are a foot wide, and the 
stars that once were bright have lost nothing of their 
real splendor, though their fair faces show less clearly 
on the faded blue field than they did when both 
were new. It would have been a loss of honor not to 
sing; it would have been treason to have stopped the 
song; it is a rich moment missed or lost whenever 
any teacher tells the story of “The Star-Spangled 
Banner ’”’ without having the class sing it. 
Every teacher who has tested the matter knows
-P-A-G-E-258
   
     
246 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
what power music, especially singing, has in school. 
It tells for morality and discipline, as well as for 
culture in the graces. The teacher of music is a uni- 
versal benefactor ; and the teacher of literature and 
the teacher of history may add vitality, culture, pleas- 
ure, and a wholesome patriotism to many a lesson by 
giving it the voice of melody — the voice of song. 
In 1814 Key’s writing of a song was doubtless 
looked upon by the few who knew of it as a minor 
incident of the capture of Washington and the re- 
pulse at Baltimore; but time has given the song a 
larger place in the history and life of our nation than 
can be claimed for either of the other events. A 
national song embodies more national sentiment, 
and perhaps more history, than any other set of words 
of equal number. A worthy song that has once 
become national has in that process made untold 
history; and it will go on down the ages elevating 
citizenship, shaping character among the people, and 
directing national policy. 
The charge brought against us by some of our for- 
eign cousins, in saying that the most conspicuous 
thing about the national anthems of America is that 
the people of America do not know them, is, or has 
been, too true. Let it be true no longer. At least, 
let the teachers and the pupils in our schools know 
the songs of our country. Such songs as “‘ America,” 
“The Star-Spangled Banner,” and “The Flag of the 
Free ”’ ought to be a part of every course in American
-P-A-G-E-259
  
‘ VALUE OF NATIONAL AND STATE SONGS 247 
history in every American school. Every good citizen 
ought to know these songs, words and music, and be 
able to join in singing them at home or abroad. 
“Dixie,” expressing a Southern sentiment that has be- 
come national,! and “‘ America the Beautiful,” express- 
ing a Northern sentiment that will become national, 
are both worthy of long life and many friends. The 
best setting of the latter in music has been made by 
Will C. Macfarlane; and in this setting the song 
may be found in the Ladies’ Home Journal of Feb- 
ruary, 1914. 
In the same periodical, issue of September, 1911, 
appeared another song that has a fine spirit in beauti- 
ful words, both being enhanced by the excellent mel- 
ody and harmony to which they are wedded. The 
words are by Henry van Dyke, the music by C. 
Austin Miles. The song is entitled “ Where the Flag 
is Full of Stars.” It should be sung all over the 
United States. 
Strange as it may seem, the Russian Hymn, trans- 
lation by H. F. Chorley and music by Alexis Lwoff, 
is one of the finest anthems for the United States or 
any other country. It is one of the great world 
hymns that may become national in any land. In 
both words and music it is a classic. It is a prayer 
to Jehovah that may be uttered with sincerity by 
1 The finest words to ‘‘ Dixie’”’ are those by M. B. Wharton, 
used in ‘‘Echoes from Dixie”; publisher, Mrs. Griff Edwards,

  248 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
any people. It is a prayer for pity, for mercy, for 
righteousness, for truth, for freedom, for peace — 
national and international. 
Apropos of the widespread peace sentiment and 
the great organized movements for international 
peace upon the basis of sincerity and justice, refer- 
ence should be made to a song recently published by 
two gentlemen of New York City, George Graff, Jr., 
author, and E. R. Ball, composer, entitled ‘‘ Let Us 
Have Peace.” This beautiful song is dedicated by 
permission to Hon. William H. Taft and to the cause 
of peace the world over. It was selected by Imre 
Kiralfy, director-general of the Anglo-American ex- 
position, to be used at the opening celebrations 
commemorating the hundred years of peace between 
Great Britain and the United States. 
Included in the study of State history should be a 
due measure of attention to State songs. Many 
particular States, perhaps most of them, have their 
own songs; and every State in the Union should 
have its proper song, or songs, sooner or later. Some 
already in use that I happen to know about are the 
following: ‘‘ My Old Kentucky Home,” ‘‘ Maryland, 
My Maryland,” ‘Old Virginia,” ‘‘ The West Virginia 
Hills,” ‘‘ The Hills of Tennessee,” ! “ Illinois,” ? “‘ The 
1. T. Hildebrand, Basie City, Va., is the composer and 
the owner of the copyright. 
2 “Tilinois”” may be found in a booklet entitled ‘‘The One 
Hundred and One Best Songs,” issued by the Cable Co., Chicago.

Red Old Hills of Georgia,” and ‘The Old North 
State.” 
A number of publishing houses in various parts of 
the country have upon the market books or other 
collections of State and national songs. Among the 
standard collections are Songs of the Nation (Silver, 
Burdett & Co., Boston), the School Song Book 
(C. C. Birchard & Co., Boston), and Songs for School 
and Flag (Macmillan). Among other firms that 
publish excellent collections of patriotic songs are 
the Orville Brewer Publishing Company, Chicago ; 
the Hall-Mack Company, Philadelphia ; Hinds, Noble 
& Eldredge, New York ; Hall & McCreary, Chicago ; 
and the A. 8S. Barnes Company, New York. 
The Children’s Library, published by Doubleday, 
Page & Co., New York, contains a volume entitled 
Songs, edited by Dolores M. Bacon, in which the 
teacher of history and the teacher of literature may 
find many helpful pieces, words and music. The 
best cheap collection of patriotic songs, especially 
State songs, on the market is a booklet entitled Songs 
of the People, published by the Ruebush-Kieffer 
Company, Dayton, Va. 
The best way to study and use State and national 
songs is, of course, to learn the words and music and 
sing them; but much variety and pleasure may be 
added by the use in school of a victrola or a grafonola. 
These machines are wonderfully perfect in their 
reproduction of all forms of music, and they are ad-

They offer fine possibilities to every teacher of his- 
tory and literature, as well as to the teacher of 
music. They make it possible for the children of 
every nation to hear and know the songs of all 
nations.

  CHAPTER XXIII 
SOURCE BOOKS AND SOURCE MATERIALS 
Tue ordinary child in reading the ordinary book 
gets no idea at all as to where or how or from whom the 
author got the facts stated or the pictures used to 
illustrate the statements. He may never inquire 
about these things; nevertheless, the teacher sooner 
or later should cause him to inquire; and it will 
certainly increase his interest in the subject presented 
and promote his general intelligence to know some- 
thing of the sources of information. The experience 
is akin to that which he had one day when he fol- 
lowed the brook, the familiar brook along which he 
had spent many happy days, across the meadows, 
through the foothills, into the mountain gap, and on 
up into the great ‘‘ kettle” in the peak, where the 
springs gush up clear and cold. The brook had a 
new meaning to him from that day. He had found 
the source. 
By sources of history we usually mean records of 
some reliable sort contemporary with the events 
recorded. Such records are most frequently docu- 
ments, writings, produced at the time and place, 
or near the time and place, associated with the 
251
-P-A-G-E-264
252 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
  events. For example, we have a letter written 
by Columbus to an official of the Spanish court, 
telling about his first voyage to America — written, 
perhaps, during the latter part of the voyage. 
This letter is an interesting and valuable source 
of information concerning that memorable voy- 
age. Again, during the sessions of the Consti- 
tutional Convention at Philadelphia in 1787 James 
Madison, a member of the Convention, kept a 
journal of the proceedings. We have the journal 
or copies of it, and it is a most valuable source con- 
cerning the framing of the Federal Constitution. 
The Declaration of Independence is a stirring con- 
temporary statement of the causes of the Revolu- 
tion. Washington’s Farewell Address is a source, 
and an authoritative source, as to Washington’s 
principles of statesmanship. Why should we spend 
all our time reading what the third or fourth or the 
fiftieth man says about Washington’s political views 
when we can read what he himself said? Why not 
go to the source? 
In source books arranged for use in schools the 
documents have been reproduced, usually being 
printed verbatim from the original written form. 
Sometimes they are reproduced almost exactly, by 
photography. Occasionally they are given in the 
most accurate translations possible, from the originals 
which are in a foreign language. In every case these 
reproductions are arranged in some kind of order,
-P-A-G-E-265

topical or chronological generally, and frequently 
according to both topics and time. Each document is 
usually preceded by an introductory note, which gives 
the historical setting. At other places other notes 
may appear, giving the meaning of obsolete words, 
explaining obscure statements and references, etc. 
Here is presented a brief list of source books for 
American history, most of which may be obtained 
without much difficulty.

Not only documents, but also inscriptions on mon- 
uments, coins, weapons, pictures, and like things, 
supply sources of information to the history student. 
All over this great country of ours — all over the 
world — are history sources in old buildings, ruins, 
costumes, implements, and furniture. The old State 
House in Boston, with Faneuil Hall, Old South 
Church, and the Old North Church; Trinity Church 
and churchyard in New York City, with Wall Street, 
and Battery Park; Independence Hall in Philadel- 
phia, with Carpenters’ Hall, the Betsy Ross House, 
and Penn’s Cottage; the national museums and art 
galleries of Washington; old St. John’s Church and 
other buildings in Richmond; ancient landmarks of 
the Spanish days at St. Augustine and many other 
places in the South: all these and many more serve 
to bring the past down into the present with a mean- 
ingful reality. Every city and nearly every town has 
numerous sources of history in this, that, or the 
other form.
-P-A-G-E-267
SOURCE BOOKS AND SOURCE MATERIALS 255 
In addition to the source books, and so on, listed 
above there are many other publications easily ac- 
cessible to the student and teacher of history which 
contain source materials of great variety, interest, 
and value. The historical magazines published in 
nearly every section of the country frequently con- 
tain rare materials not generally available. The 
Congressional Globe, the Congressional Record, and 
the collected Acts of state legislatures are rich mines 
of treasure for the antiquarian, as are also county 
records, published and unpublished, with the an- 
nual journals and reports of educational, religious, 
and scientific organizations. 
Files of old newspapers, magazines, and almanacs 
are often some of the most interesting and satisfac- 
tory sources of history. Numerous diaries and jour- 
nals, published and unpublished, are to be found 
nearly everywhere. Time will add to their interest 
and value. A Confederate Girl’s Diary, just given to 
the public (1913) by the Houghton Mifflin Company, 
Boston, is a notable example. Books of travel, often 
written by foreign scholars, give us glimpses of 
ourselves through the eyes of others. Burnaby’s 
Travels Through North America (A. Wessels Co., 
New York, 1904) is an excellent example of this 
class of source books. 
Some of the values to be realized from the use of 
source books and source materials in schools may 
be indicated briefly in tabular form : — 
 
-P-A-G-E-268
  256 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
1. They illuminate the textbook and quicken the 
historical imagination. 
2. They make the picture more vivid and vital, 
producing a sense of reality not felt in long-distance 
accounts. 
3. They give the pupil definite notions; they make 
things plain. 
4. They emphasize the personal element in history ; 
they give one an intimate personal acquaintance with 
great men and women of the past. They make the 
bonds of personal sympathy more keen and intelligent. 
5. They have a decided value in economy. Owing 
to their directness, definiteness, and comprehensive- 
ness, they give more complete information in a few 
pages than might be acquired apart from them in 
many pages of description. For example, in teach- 
ing civil government, more definite information may 
be obtained from the Federal Constitution concern- 
ing the national government, or from a state consti- 
tution concerning the corresponding state govern- 
ment, than from three or four times as much other 
matter in the average textbook. 
6. Sources stimulate interest. 
7. After studying the sources the student is con- 
scious of a new sense of certainty. He feels that he 
is justified in drawing conclusions for himself. 
Not many of the sources listed above, except the 
four volumes of source readers, could be used in 
the grades. More liberal use of sources may be made 
in the high school, the normal school, and the college.

  CHAPTER XXIV 
ON VOYAGES OF DISCOVERY 
~ In reaching America Columbus had the joy of tri- 
umph, in that he believed he had accomplished what 
he had set out to do; and, as Joaquin Miller says, 
he gave the world its grandest lesson: “ Sail on!” 
Yet Columbus missed a keener joy — the thrill of 
knowing that he had found a new world — or, more 
exactly, a world that was lost. The joy of achieve- 
ment has ever reached its rarest heights in the heart- 
leap of discovery. We must respect the emotion of 
Balboa when he first beheld the Pacific, and of Coper- 
nicus when he found the true center of the physical 
universe ; for it is right that the desire to add some- 
thing to the common store should stir the soul, and 
that it should leap with joy when it finds a new treas- 
ure for the sons of men. 
Fortunately, too, the joy of discovery is not re- 
served for those alone who find new continents or 
new oceans or new centers of the world. The child 
may have this joy by finding a shining pebble in the 
brook, or by discovering that he can whistle or swim, 
Perhaps the keenest joys come in the discovery of un- 
suspected powers for good achievement within our- 
8 267
-P-A-G-E-270
  258 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
selves. The best discovery is often made in finding 
oneself. Moreover, a little triumph of discovery 
in the world without often leads to greater awaken- 
ings in the world within. Dr. M. G. Brumbaugh 
tells of a backward boy who for a year was dull and 
listless. Finally, one rainy afternoon in early sum- 
mer, going out with his classmates upon a botany 
excursion, he unexpectedly found a rare white orchid. 
The beauty of that white flower and the thrill of joy 
attending the finding of it awoke that boy’s long- 
sleeping spirit, and marked the beginning of a life 
of splendid achievement. 
Occasionally in a history class some child seems to 
take little or no interest in what others have done. 
This may be the time to set him doing something. 
If he is not stirred by the discoveries others have 
made, perhaps he will be aroused to interest and con- 
tinued effort if he is led to make a discovery for him- 
self. But what can he do? What can a child dis- 
cover in history? 
The chances are, of course, that any discovery he 
may make will have but little value for others; but 
if it have even the least value for him, it will be well 
worth while. 
One of the most interesting exercises I have ever 
found for my classes may be called The Voyage of 
Discovery. I say to the class : — 
“During the next month I want each one of you to go 
out and find something new. It may be anything of
-P-A-G-E-271
  ON VOYAGES OF DISCOVERY 259 
historical interest, but I prefer that you find something 
in your own community. Look about in your neighbor- 
hood —in your own home. Ask your father or your 
grandfather, or any one else that you think may know 
something of historical interest, to tell you about some 
persons or events of the past. Try to find something 
that is not widely known. If possible, find something 
that has never been written out or printed. Take pains 
to get the exact and complete facts; write them out 
accurately in good form; and at the end of the month 
bring in your discoveries. We shall have a red-letter day 
for opening and reading these stories.” 
Always there are members of the class who at first 
despair of finding anything; but in a little while 
every one sets out upon his voyage in earnest. A 
few perhaps need to be aided further by judicious 
suggestions; but, so far as I now recall, no one has 
ever failed to discover something; and all enjoy 
the search and the results therefrom. Some of these 
discoveries have been well worth preserving. 
Even children in the grades can make discoveries 
of this sort. So far as values in enlarged interest are 
concerned, they may perhaps be realized in the grades 
better than anywhere else. The natural enthusiasm 
of childhood lends itself finely to the processes of 
seeking and finding. 
Some of the sources to which students may go on 
these voyages of discovery are indicated below. 
For the child, the teacher must in some measure  
-P-A-G-E-272
260 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
point the way. Advanced students should be able 
to perceive fields of possibilities for themselves, but 
even for them a few guideposts may be useful. Ac- 
cordingly, the list of sources herewith presented is 
intended to be helpful, at least in suggestion, to stu- 
dents in high schools, normal schools, and colleges, 
as well as to pupils in the grades. 
A List or Sourcrs 
SOME FIELDS FOR DISCOVERY 
1. County records. — In every county-seat, partic- 
ularly in the older counties, are to be found veritable 
treasures for the student of history. The records of 
deeds, wills, and land surveys often contain materials 
of real and unsuspected interest. Lists of property, 
real and personal, made out for purposes of taxation, 
or recorded in deeds of trust and other mortgages, 
are often illuminating with reference to social and 
economic conditions. The minute books of the 
courts of long ago are nearly always rich in a variety 
of valuable historical materials. Only advanced 
students, however, are able to use such records to 
much advantage. 
2. Records belonging to old churches, educational 
institutions, and patriotic societies. — These may be 
found in the form of registers of marriages and 
baptisms, records of business meetings, minutes of 
faculties and committees, catalogues and bulletins, 
   
-P-A-G-E-273
    
ON VOYAGES OF DISCOVERY 261 
constitutions and by-laws, programs, and lists of 
names. 
3. Old daybooks, ledgers, and other business 
records. — One of the most interesting sources I 
have ever seen is an old daybook that was used by a 
country merchant during the beginnings of the Revo- 
lutionary War. On one of the fly-leaves, for example, 
is a list of supplies contributed for the relief of the 
far-away ‘“ Bostonians,” whose port at that time was 
blockaded under the famous Boston Port Bill. 
4, Old buildings and ruins. — Many old dwelling 
houses have quaint inscriptions here or there, or they 
are invested with an interesting history that is known 
to only a few persons. 
5. Unmarked places of historic interest.— In every 
neighborhood there are places with which are asso- 
ciated striking incidents of more or less significance. 
The exact location of many of these places is known 
to only a few individuals who will soon pass away. 
It is a real service to the community and to posterity 
when the story of such a place is discovered by one 
who will take the pains to write it down. Aged per- 
sons with good memories should be sought out and 
consulted by the student and teacher of local history. 
6. Old letters, diaries, and other personal records 
of a generation or two past. — Old letters, especially, 
are often rich sources for facts and incidents that 
have much more than a local interest. For example, 
I have before me a letter that was written from the
-P-A-G-E-274
  
  262 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
California gold fields shortly after the rush to the 
Golden Gate. It contains first-hand information 
about social and economic conditions that are full 
of interest and value to the student of history and 
sociology. Old trunks, bureaus, chests, and writing 
desks frequently contain real treasures that may be 
found with little effort. 
1In connection with the subject of this chapter an article 
entitled ‘‘An Experiment in Teaching Local History,” by Eliza- 
beth B. White, in the History Teacher’s Magazine, September, 
1913, will be found of particular interest.
-P-A-G-E-275
CHAPTER XXV 
MNEMONIC DEVICES 
Tue notion that history is merely a ‘‘ memory sub- 
ject ” and that one cannot. study history profitably 
without memorizing a great many dates, with page 
after page of statements, word for word, is, of course, 
erroneous; but we may as well admit the fact that 
memory is a necessary power in the study and use of 
history as well as in everything else in the curriculum. 
Imagination and thought are possible only when 
memory supplies ready materials and serves as a basis 
of operation. Likewise, the definite matter of his- 
tory can have a positive, everyday value in thought, 
in speech, in action only when the memory holds it 
faithfully before us. The student in school needs no 
argument to convince him that a good many things in 
history must be remembered. The teacher of his- 
tory should profit by his pupil’s conviction. Any 
teacher who is under the necessity of consulting the 
chronicle for every date, the index for every name, 
and the encyclopedia for every fact in every half 
hour that he stands before his class must be greatly 
handicapped, not to say embarrassed. 
There are some persons of ‘“ blessed memory.” 
263 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
  264 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
That is to say, they can remember names, places, 
facts, and dates almost without an effort. But such 
persons are few. The majority of us must make a 
special effort to fix an impression, and then more 
special effort to deepen it and command it. There is 
no magic trick for remembering history any more 
than there is such a trick for remembering the rules 
of grammar or the formule of chemistry. However, 
remembering history ought to be much easier than 
the remembering of either of the other subjects 
named. History is such an interesting, connected, 
logical order that it lends itself naturally to the pro- 
cesses of memory. Just as it is easier to remember a 
story or a poem than it is to remember a lot of dis- 
connected sentences or numbers, so it is easier to 
retain a mental grip on history than on any subject 
in which human interest is lacking or the reason 
searches vainly for whys and wherefores. Because 
of its multiplicity of incident and the logic of its 
constructive principles history clutches the memory 
circumstantial and beckons the memory philosophi- 
cal. It would perhaps be more strictly true to say 
that the memory clutches history. There is a magic 
here, but it is the magic that makes every memory 
wonderful. No new power is needed ; we only need 
to know the powers we have, and how to use them. 
Accordingly, the relations of resemblance, contrast, 
contiguity in time and place, cause and effect, all 
combine in aiding the memory in history; and these
-P-A-G-E-277

ordinary forces are generally adequate for all ordinary 
purposes and persons. Nevertheless, once in a while 
some special device may be used to advantage. 
Every device suggested herein is simple and natural, 
and is presented as an illustration of what the student 
may find for himself rather than as something made 
and given by another. No artificial system of mne- 
monics is outlined or even recommended. Most such 
systems are worse burdens in themselves than are the 
friendly facts they are supposed to carry. 
One of the best ways to aid memory is to write 
down carefully and plainly the thing to be remem- 
bered. If some unique or striking form is employed, 
the mnemonic value is increased. The following 
outlines may serve to illustrate this suggestion.

by putting into it a forced alliteration or other repe- 
tend of sound, as in the following examples : —

Sometimes a date written altogether in figures 
presents a striking form, as, for example, the date of 
the signing of the Great Charter, June 15, 1215; 
otherwise, 6, 15, 12, 15. The date of Burgoyne’s 
surrender is a notable combination of eight and 
seven: Oct. 17, 1777; otherwise, Oct. 17, 17, 77; 
or, 10, 17, 17, 77. 
See how easy it is to remember the victories of 
Perry and Macdonough on the Lakes, in the War of 
1812, when the dates are written together thus :— 
Perry, on Lake Erie, Sept. 10, 1813; or 9, 10, 1813. 
Macdonough on Lake Sept. 11, 1814; or 9, 11, 1814.

It happens that there are some very striking 
resemblances between the 7th President of the United 
States and the 17th President, some of which may 
be suggested by the remarkable similarities in their 
names, etc. :— 
7th President, Andrew Jackson. 
17th President, Andrew Johnson. 
The initial history of the Monroe Doctrine neces- 
sitates some reference to the Holy Alliance. The 
curious word formed by the several letters beginning 
the two parts of the name, and the names of the

stick to the memory like a scene of childhood :—

Whatever Harap may be or mean, it helps me to 
remember the Holy Alliance and the countries that 
made it up. The character and purpose of the 
Alliance may be set forth upon the same curious

MNEMONIC DEVICES 269 
A number of devices for remembering the names of 
the Presidents in order have been published. The 
following one, brought to my attention by one of my 
pupils, is about the best I have seen : — 
“Washington And Jefferson Made Many A Joke. Van 
Buren Had Trouble Plenty To Find Proper Banknotes. 
Let Johnson Go Home Grinning At Congress Heartily. 
Cleveland Made Roosevelt Tarry Wilfully.” 
In this mnemonic the names of some of the Pres- 
idents appear in their places, and the initials of the 
others are given in their proper order in the initial 
letters of the respective words. 
One other example must suffice. This was given 
me several years ago by Dr. 8. Rolfe Millar, who 
said that it was seen one day, written upon a sheet 
of paper, hanging on the wall of Richard T. Ely’s 
room, while the latter was a student at the University 
of Heidelberg. It is a key to the names of the royal 
families of Great Britain, beginning with the Nor- 
mans and coming down to the present : — 
“No plan like yours to study history or biography. 
No — Norman 
Plan — Plantagenet 
Like — Lancaster 
Yours — York 
To— Tudor 
Study — Stuart 
History or Biography — Hanover or Brunswick ”   
 
-P-A-G-E-282
  270 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
This is not only a clever device to aid the memory, 
but it also suggests a vital truth to the student and 
teacher. There is no plan like yours — no plan so 
good as yours, if yours is a good plan — for studying 
or teaching. There is probably no device that will 
aid your memory so much as one that you discover or 
invent for yourself. As a student, you should de- 
velop some plans and methods of your own, and 
these should be ever ready and useful, even if you 
forget what others have suggested. As a teacher, 
you should be observant, inventive, and courageous, 
ready to try and test what your reason, your ex- 
perience, or your aims may suggest, or your needs 
may demand. The good teacher’s best plans are 
his own plans; and no one is a good teacher without 
having some plans of his own.

  CHAPTER XXVI 
4S DEVICES FOR REVIEW AND RECREATION 
In this chapter it is my purpose to indicate in 
brief, tabular form some particular things that may 
be done in history classes for the sake of both knowl- 
edge and pleasure. These things are indicated 
here in a separate division because they may be 
properly regarded as somewhat out of the ordinary, 
and hence to be used only occasionally. It should 
be understood, however, that they are all things 
that are practicable and easy to carry out. Every 
one of them has been tested and approved by actual 
class room experiment. 
1. Biographical review. — This may come in very 
appropriately at the end of a quarter or a session, 
at the end of a book, or at the end of a course. It 
may also be used at the beginning of a session for the 
purpose of recalling leading characters and events, 
and thus getting a fresh grip upon past work as a 
good start for new progress. The process is logical 
and simple. The teacher makes out a list of promi- 
nent names in the field of history last covered, 
arranging them chronologically. They are assigned, 
in order, to particular members of the class for 
271 
onl
-P-A-G-E-284
  272 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
special study. On each character the proper stu- 
dent prepares a two-minute report in which an 
effort is made to point out the special significance 
of the man’s work, as well as to state leading bio- 
graphical facts. 
At the meeting of the class the teacher calls for the 
reports in order, each pupil rising in his place and 
responding promptly. In a half hour a dozen such 
reports may be made, and as many assignments 
given out for the next day. Three or four days may 
be required to complete the series. 
2. Who’s Who in America? — A profitable ex- 
ercise that logically follows the one outlined above 
is the identification of the personages concerning 
whom reports have been recently given in class. 
(Divide the class into two groups, or sides, as for the 
‘old-time spelling match. _}Let the teacher call out 
the name of a particular historical character, and 
let the proper student, on the proper side, give a 
satisfactory identification. If he fail in this, let 
the name be passed to the proper student on the 
opposite side. Let each failure put the “ failer” 
down and out, for the time. 
If it is known that such a contest as this may fol- 
low the biographical reports, better attention may 
thereby be secured to those reports ; and the exercise 
of identification will not only test the memory, but 
will also give training in the selection of significant 
facts regarding each person identified} The teacher
-P-A-G-E-285
    DEVICES FOR REVIEW AND RECREATION 273 
should insist upon accuraté and satisfactory state- 
ments in every instance. 
3. Proper names properly spelled. — One of the 
very best exercises for review or recreation in a 
history class is a regular spelling match over the 
proper names of history: names of persons, places, 
events, occasions, achievements, and so on, that are 
spelled with capital letters. The captains should be 
elected in advance, and they should have the class 
divided before the period of the contest comes. If 
they will hand the teacher the names of one side, 
he can call those names in less than a minute; then 
all whose names are not called will compose the 
opposite side. By such a plan only a minute or two 
will be required for preliminaries, and practically 
the whole period will be available for spelling. 
Easy names should be given for the first round or 
two; then harder ones may be used. 
4. A battle over the generals. — Many persons 
get the generals named in American history muck 
confused. Frequently one is not able to tell whether 
Schimmelfennig, for example, fought in the Revolu- 
tion or in some other war ; and if by chance he should 
guess the proper war, he could not tell, to save his 
life, whether the said general wore blue or gray, red 
or buff. Accordingly, real instruction and real 
pleasure may be combined in a contest between two 
classes, or two parts of the same class, in which the 
contestants shall be called upon first to say whether 
>
-P-A-G-E-286
  274 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
such and such a general figured in this or that or the 
other war; and, second, to tell upon which side he 
stood. I think it is well to go around the class first, 
or over the list first, having the officers properly 
classified as to wars; then take a second round, 
requiring each contestant to tell both things: 
(1) The name of the war in which the man figured ; 
(2) the side upon which he fought. 
5. Geographical contest. — Hardly anything puz- 
ales a history student so much as a question in 
historical geography. Yet, hardly anything is more 
necessary to a clear and complete notion, in many 
instances, than a definite idea of geography. A 
most interesting and profitable contest may be had 
in calling for the location of particular places that 
figure prominently in our national history. First, 
the location of the place may be called for; second, 
a definite statement regarding the thing that has 
made the place famous. Variety may be secured 
if the teacher will occasionally indicate the location 
of the place himself, and then ask the pupil to give 
the name of the place described. 
6. Chain-method maps.— The teacher selects 
some small, simple map in the textbook and assigns 
a small, definite part of it to one pupil after another, 
until every part of the map has been assigned. He 
then assigns the same parts, in the same order, to 
another group of pupils, equal in number to the first 
group. Each pupil is expected to practice drawing
-P-A-G-E-287
    
DEVICES FOR REVIEW AND RECREATION 275 
his particular part until he can draw it quickly and 
with fair accuracy. In a day or two the two groups 
are put to work, at opposite ends or sides of the room. 
Each “ artist ”’ puts in his part in regular order, from 
first to last. The group that finishes first makes 
the first score in the contest ; the group that makes 
the best map gets the second score, which may be 
double in value to the first. All the drawing in 
the contest is done, of course, from memory. 
7. Our first citizens. — Some day you may give 
an interesting exercise in this manner: Announce 
that upon a certain occasion in the near future a 
vote will be taken on this question: ‘‘ What man 
has rendered the greatest service to the United 
States?’ Announce also that another vote will 
then be taken for the second honor, on the question : 
“What man after ... has rendered the greatest 
service to the United States? ”’ 
At the same time, or upon another day, take votes 
to accord first honor and second honor among the 
great women of our land. 
Let all voting be by written ballot, with each ballot 
containing the name of only one person. The first 
ballot will serve, perhaps, only to nominate certain 
candidates. Subsequent ballots may be taken upon 
the three or five names leading in the first ballot, 
until one name gets a majority of the votes. 
8. Election day. — In history or civil government 
a voting booth may be prepared, judges and clerks
-P-A-G-E-288
276 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
of election appointed, and a form of election, with 
the Australian ballot, be gone through with. To 
make the proceedings more complete and instructive, 
a registrar may be appointed some time in advance, 
and the several members of the class may be duly 
registered, each one presenting qualifications that 
are acceptable under the state and national con- 
stitutions. 
9. Date contest. — The principle of contest, which 
adds so much of interest and enthusiasm wherever 
it is applied, may be utilized in making up the list 
of dates suggested in Chapter XXI. For example, 
if an approved list of thirty dates in American history 
is to be decided upon, let each member of the class 
make a list of thirty dates for consideration. One 
after the other, different members of the class may 
be called upon to suggest dates, one at a time, for 
the approved list, no date being admitted to that list 
without a certain number of (say, five or ten) approv- 
ing votes, the teacher retaining a veto power in each 
case. Probably forty or more dates, of all those sug- 
gested, will receive the requisite number of approving 
votes. The teacher should then eliminate ten, or the 
number required, to bring the approved list down to 
thirty. Then some small prize may be awarded to 
the pupil whose personal list is found to contain the 
largest number of dates on the approved list. 
Various other contests with dates may be devised 
by any ingenious teacher. 
 
-P-A-G-E-289
  DEVICES FOR REVIEW AND RECREATION 277 
10. A question list.— One of the most helpful 
things a teacher can do for his class is to make out 
for them a list of questions based upon the textbook. 
These questions may be numbered consecutively 
from the beginning, and may be few or many. 
This is so simple and commonplace that one hesitates 
to mention it at all, but it is so practicable and is 
always received with so much appreciation that it 
cannot be overlooked. 
11. Question-box day. — On a certain day each 
member of the class may be requested to write out 
a question on a piece of paper of convenient size 
and drop it into the class question box upon coming 
into the room. If the class contain only ten or 
twelve members, each one may be allowed to drop 
in two or three questions. The teacher then opens 
the question box and conducts the quiz for the day 
altogether from the pupils’ own questions. If two 
or more days at the end of a guarter should be set 
aside for review, one of them could very profitably 
be used as question-box day. This method will be 
found interesting and helpful at any time. Before 
the teacher undertakes it, however, he should be 
pretty certain of the ground to be covered. It is 
not a very easy thing for the inexperienced teacher 
to take up one question after another and answer it 
promptly and correctly — when somebody else has 
framed the question. It should be understood, of 
course, that only reasonable questions are to be 
 
-P-A-G-E-290
  
  278 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
submitted. Any “smart” question, or any one 
that is evidently not given in good faith, should be 
cast aside without ceremony. To insure care in 
every question, it is well to have each one signed. 
12. Class debate. — An occasional formal debate 
in class, on some question of historical or current 
interést, may be made both instructive and enter- 
taining. Judges should be secured from outside 
the class, if possible. 
13. Lantern talks. — By means of collections of 
post cards or lantern slides the teacher may now and 
then illustrate a special talk that will be illuminating 
to his pupils regarding this or that subject. His- 
toric places lend themselves finely to such methods. 
Whatever approaches the eye-gate is likely to find 
ready entrance and a kind welcome. 
14. Picture contest.— A pleasing variation of 
No. 13 may be had by showing, preferably on the 
lantern screen, a lot of historical pictures, numbered 
but not named, and allowing the class to guess the 
names or subjects. The series may include portraits 
of famous men and women, photographs of historic 
objects and places, reproductions of well-known 
paintings, a map or two, or anything of like helpful 
nature. Each member of the class may write his 
guess after the respective number, as the pictures are 
shown; and at the end a prize may be awarded for 
the best list of answers. 
 
-P-A-G-E-291
  CHAPTER XXVITI 
HISTORY NOTEBOOKS 
In this chapter we shall consider first the teacher’s 
own notebook; second, the notebook that the 
pupil may make under the teacher’s direction. The 
subject may be presented at the beginning of a course 
of instruction, to give the student practical aid at 
the earliest possible moment. 
The teacher’s notebook should be for him a ready 
manual, a portfolio of materials and plans ready for 
use. The pupil’s notebook should be for him an open 
laboratory, as well as a volume of record. In every 
case, however, especially in normal schools, the 
pupil’s notebook should be potentially, if not de- 
signedly, a teacher’s notebook. Every teacher 
should be able to use in some measure, as a teacher, 
the notebook he formerly made as a pupil. 
Many of the publishing houses nowadays are able 
to supply notebooks prepared in advance, in outline, 
for the use of different history classes. Some of 
these are excellent, especially for beginners or in- 
experienced pupils; and more particular notice will 
be given certain ones at the end of this chapter. For 
the teacher, however, and for the advanced pupil, 
279 
 
-P-A-G-E-292
280 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
I am of the opinion that no notebook is quite so valu- 
able, either in the process of construction or in sub- 
sequent use, as the book made wholly by himself, 
for himself, and largely in his own way. 
The teacher’s notebook may be of any convenient 
size or form. However, if the pages are smaller in 
size than 8 by 10 inches, the space on a page will 
often be found inadequate for various purposes. 
Unruled pages will be found preferable in most cases. 
Maps, outlines, diagrams, and drawings are often 
interrupted by conventional lines. The paper of a 
notebook should be of good quality and of sufficient 
weight to bear pictures and clippings pasted on it. 
On the whole, the most satisfactory combination I 
have found, for teacher and pupil alike, is composed 
of the University Note Cover, No. 6, filled with both 
ruled and unruled detachable leaves. The advan- 
tages thus secured are obvious. This book is elastic, 
not only in the sense that many or few leaves may 
be carried at a time, but also in the sense that 
pasted-in clippings and pictures will not strain the 
binding. Since the leaves may be taken out at any 
time, and may be arranged in any desired order, 
such a notebook can be used for three or four dif- 
ferent classes. The only necessary rule is this: 
“Put only one kind of notes on each leaf.’ The 
possibility of having at hand either ruled or un- 
ruled leaves is also an advantage. For ordinary 
line writing the ruled leaves may be used ; for draw-
-P-A-G-E-293
  HISTORY NOTEBOOKS 281 
ings, maps, and such entries, the unruled leaves are 
available. 
Having the notebook ready, but empty as yet, 
what shall be put into it, and how? The answers 
here must vary in accordance with the teacher’s 
field or grade of work. Obviously, the materials 
selected and the manner of arrangement must be 
adapted to the primary grades, if the teacher is a 
primary teacher; and the same is true, with neces- 
sary changes, for the high school teacher, the normal 
school teacher, and the college teacher. But in all 
grades and fields, perhaps, the following things may 
be found desirable and appropriate. 
1. Lesson plans. — Every teacher should have a 
plan of some sort. It may be elaborate or compen- 
dious, but it should be logical and workable. It may 
not be written down anywhere, except in the ready 
convolutions of the teacher’s brain; but if it be writ- 
ten down on paper, the teacher’s notebook is a good 
place for it. Young and inexperienced teachers 
will find the making of lesson plans almost as help- 
ful as the actual using of them. The lesson plan, 
as written down, may consist of only a list of ques- 
tions; but if so, the notebook is a good place for 
these questions, which should be preserved, at least 
for a while, for use in review or for the teacher’s 
own reference. 
2. Lists of names, events, and dates. — The 
teacher of American history should be able to name
-P-A-G-E-294
ee ee Te eee 
282 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
offhand, in order, all the Presidents of the United 
States, and be able at the same time to give the ap- 
proximate date of each administration; but until he 
is able to do this he ought to have the names neatly 
tabulated in his notebook, in a straight column, with 
the proper ordinal numeral preceding each name, and 
the exact date of the administration following. Such 
a list will sometimes be needed for testing the pupils 
in class, and will always be convenient for reference. 
The next step would be to enlarge this outline by 
writing down under each name the chief events of 
the administration. 
In a similar manner the teacher may have ready at 
hand in his notebook a list of important inventions, 
with the date in each case and the name of the in- 
ventor; parallel lists of Federal and Confederate 
generals; parallel lists of Republican and Demo- 
cratic leaders; a list of important political events ; 
a list of important economic and industrial events ; 
a list of recent events of note; a list of subjects of 
special current interest and significance. All these 
are good; but everything mentioned here is sug- 
gested rather than prescribed. The resourceful 
teacher will do many other things, all of which may 
be, perhaps, better for him. 
8. A list of topics, with specific references to 
sources of information.— The teacher must know 
not only what topics merit special study, but also 
where definite information on these topics may be   
 
-P-A-G-E-295
  HISTORY NOTEBOOKS 283 
found. Accordingly, it is well for every teacher to 
work out for his notebook a list of from twenty to 
fifty such topics as ‘‘ Home Life in Colonial Days,” 
“The Navigation Acts,” ‘‘ The Making of the Fed- 
eral Constitution,” ‘‘ Protection and Free Trade,” 
“The Westward Movement,” ‘‘ Immigration,” put- 
ting down under each, in tabular form, a number of 
references to sources of information and illustration. 
The topics should be arranged in logical or chrono- 
logical order. The references may lead to archives, 
to source books, to general or special treatises, to 
articles in current periodicals, to standard works 
of fiction, to historical poems, to maps, charts, and 
pictures. Each reference should be full and specific. 
A reference to a book should give not only the title 
of the book and the author’s name, but also the ap- 
propriate chapter and pages. References to periodi- 
cals should give at least the name of the article, with 
the exact and full date of the particular issue con- 
taining the article, in each case. Some of the best 
things extant on many history topics may be found 
in standard magazines, and often nowhere else. 
4. Classified lists of books of historical interest. — 
These books should be such as are suitable for the 
school libraries of different grades as well as for the 
home reading and reference of the children. The 
teacher will find such lists convenient not only in 
finding her own materials and in assigning work to 
the more advanced classes, but also in answering  
-P-A-G-E-296
284 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
questions from principals and parents regarding the 
purchase of books for school and home. 
5. Quotations and summaries. — Striking state- 
ments of great historical facts are found in every 
standard work. A number of these may, with inter- 
est and profit, be assembled in the teacher’s note- 
book for use in class. Each one, of course, should 
be exactly reproduced and properly credited. Brief 
summaries of extended readings are convenient, and 
the making of such summaries is an excellent exer- 
cise for teacher or pupil. 
6. Clippings and pictures. — If a teacher does not 
keep a complete indexed file of periodicals, he will 
find it very desirable to preserve in his notebook a 
number of clippings that have value for his work. 
In most cases, perhaps, these clippings will be made 
from papers that are not of sufficient value, or not 
esteemed of sufficient value, to be preserved entire. 
Each piece selected should be cut out neatly, and 
pasted into the notebook at some place where it has 
relation to its surroundings. Especial care should 
always be taken to put under each clipping the name 
of the periodical from which it was taken, with the 
exact date of issue. Great collections of clippings are 
often rendered almost worthless simply because they 
cannot be mane with any authority or any date. 
In the collection of historical pictures for his note- 
book the teacher is nowadays offered a wonderfully 
rich and varied field. The advertising pages of mag- 
 
-P-A-G-E-297
    
HISTORY NOTEBOOKS 285 
azines, the book catalogues of publishing houses, 
specimen pages of new textbooks, postage stamps 
that record history, picture post cards from every- 
where, not to mention the pictures prepared specially 
for school use, are continually coming to his hand. 
They all have an interest and a value for his work 
if he will but take them, preserve them, and use them. 
His notebook has great possibilities as a filing cabi- 
net and as a picture gallery. 
7. Maps and drawings. — These should not be 
mere copies, but original and unique, as far as possible. 
If the teacher visit a place of historic interest, let 
him draw a map in his notebook for subsequent use. 
This map may be reproduced upon the blackboard 
by the teacher or a member of the class. The fact 
that this map is not found in any published work will 
give it double interest and value. In like manner 
drawings of historical relics — houses, implements, 
weapons, etc. — may be made and used with pleasure 
and profit. 
An important principle to observe in making the 
notebook is this: Make it open and approachable. 
A succession of solidly written pages in a notebook 
or in anything else is neither open nor approachable. 
Accordingly, make frequent headings, paginal or 
marginal, throughout your book. Leave a blank 
line between paragraphs. Whenever possible put a 
statement, especially a series of related lines, in 
tabular form. Use outlines, ‘“ graphs,’ and dia- 
 
-P-A-G-E-298
  286 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
grams freely. Write in a hand compact and legible. 
In every case try to make the entry attractive, dis- 
tinctive, and easy to find. A notebook is of little 
value unless it can be opened readily at the particu- 
lar thing needed. 
So much for the teacher’s notebook. Let us now 
consider the notebook that the pupil may make under 
the teacher’s direction. 
In general, the things already enumerated as de- 
sirable for the teacher’s notebook are also appropriate 
for the pupil’s use. Lists of names, events, and 
dates, a list of topics with specific references, quota- 
tions and summaries, clippings and pictures, maps 
and drawings should all be worked out in due place 
and proportion. Normal school pupils will not, of 
course, neglect the lesson plan. A fine notebook in 
the hands of the teacher may well serve as a model 
for the pupil. With special reference, however, to the 
pupil’s work, a few additional suggestions are offered. 
1. Let the pupil keep a careful record of all readings 
outside the regular textbook. The following form is 
recommended : — 
Topic: Columbus and his Achievements. 
Readings on this topic: 
1. Nida: The Dawn of American History in Europe; 
Chapter XXIII, pp. 279-296. 
(Brief summary of the reading or a notable ex- 
tract from it.) 
(Date when the reading was done.)
-P-A-G-E-299
  HISTORY NOTEBOOKS 287 
2. Renouf: Outlines of General History; Chapter 
XXI, pp. 251-256. 
(Brief summary or a notable quotation.) 
(Date.) 
3. Garner and Lodge: History of the United States; 
Vol. I, Chapter II, divisions I and II, pp. 31- 
64. 
(Brief summary, with notable quotations.) 
(Date.) 
The making of such records as these will serve 
different helpful purposes. Thereby the pupil will 
get training in careful reading and in the art of select- 
ing main facts. He will get into the scholarly habit 
of making exact references and giving due credits. 
He will build up a classified bibliography that may 
be of convenience and value in the future. From 
such records the pupil or teacher may determine at 
any time just what and how much parallel reading 
has been done. The satisfaction of having a definite 
record is worth something in both equipment and 
character. 
2. The pupil should put into his notebook the work 
that the teacher puts on the blackboard or presents 
in original charts and diagrams. Exceptions to this 
there may be, but this may stand as a general rule. 
The pupil should not try to write down everything 
the teacher says; for, in the process, unless he be an 
expert stenographer, he will miss altogether many 
things of greater importance than those he gets. 
 
-P-A-G-E-300
    288 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
Close and unbroken attention to a lecture, with note- 
taking only at intervals, is usually worth more than 
the futile and distracting effort to record everything. 
A most excellent plan is this: Listen carefully, with 
discrimination, to what is said; then go to your room 
and write down in good form an outline of what you 
have heard. Not the least among the values ob- 
tained from this process are those developed in atten- 
tion and memory. 
3. All class reports and essays that the pupil is 
required to prepare may well be retained as part of 
his notebook. 
4. In observation lessons normal school students 
will secure much valuable material for notes. All 
formal reports on observation work should of course 
be incorporated in the proper notebook for future 
study. Moreover, with normal school students every 
lesson should be an observation lesson. Every 
teacher should be carefully observed; and every 
good method he uses or suggests should be noted. It 
may also be necessary occasionally to record a caution 
against some proceeding that is obviously bad. 
5. All historical discoveries, wherever and when- 
ever made, should be recorded. As the boy or girl 
is coming and going, at home, at school, abroad, 
during school time and in vacation, facts and objects 
of historical value will be found; places and things 
of historical interest will be seen; persons who are 
making history, or have made it, will be met. The
-P-A-G-E-301
  HISTORY NOTEBOOKS 289 
student with the true historical instinct will seize 
upon every opportunity thus presented, and his 
notebook, his teacher, and his classmates, not to 
speak of himself, will be the richer ever afterward. 
Inasmuch as the pupil’s notebook should, as far as 
possible, register his own work and individuality, and 
thus aid him to self-expression and constructive 
power, few hard and fast rules should be given him. 
It may well be required that all notebooks in the 
same class be of the same kind to begin with; but to 
require that they all follow a certain form, and be 
practically the same at the end, would be absurd. 
Such a rule would smack of Egypt or China. 
Accuracy, neatness, and artistic quality are high 
values in notebook work, and should be emphasized 
throughout. The constant recognition of these 
values gives the pupil character and skill. They 
appear in his work as good form and attractiveness. 
Let the notebook grow into a thing of beauty; then 
it will be a joy forever. Then it will be made with 
pleasure; it will be referred to with satisfaction; it 
will be kept with profit for a larger future. 
For the benefit of those teachers or pupils who 
need or desire notebooks in American history, pre- 
pared in outline, the following paragraphs are offered. 
Therein are briefly described some excellent manuals 
that the author has examined.

Kansas. In the complete book are 40 outline maps, 
with specific directions accompanying each one. The 
series, when completed according to directions, depicts 
most of the great movements and events in United States 
history that have a geographical basis. This book may 
be secured in three parts, one for the 7th grade, one for 
the 8th grade, and one for the high school. 
2. Ivanhoe Historical Note Book Series; Part I, United 
States History; Atkinson, Mentzer & Co., New York and 
Chicago. This book contains 42 outline maps, with ac- 
companying directions. There are also suggestions for 
reviews, and a few blank pages for notes or an essay. In 
the Ivanhoe series is a special notebook to accompany 
the study of Texas history. 
3. McKinley’s Historical Notebook for United States 
History; McKinley Publishing Co., Philadelphia. This 
book contains 26 outline maps, to be filled out from the 
study of standard books, to which specific references are 
made. Alternate leaves are blank, for notes and essays. 
4. White’s Pupil’s Outline Studies in United States 
History; American Book Co., New York and Chicago. 
Drawings, outlines, essays, and special development of 
topics are provided for in this book, as well as the filling 
out of maps. There are in all 128 pages. 
The first three books described above are in size 
about 8 by 103 inches, and open at the end ; the last is 
about 8 by 9 inches, and opens at the side. The prices 
range from 20 to 30 cents. None of them ought to 
be used below the 7th grade, and all could be used with 
profit in the high school and in the normal school.

  CHAPTER XXVIII 
THE TEACHER’S LESSON PLAN 
To work without a plan is to work without intelli- 
gence, and at the sacrifice of economy, efficiency, 
and directness. It would be no more wasteful and 
absurd for a builder to begin a house without a plan 
than for ateacher to begin a course or a lesson without 
a plan. 
A plan made in advance is essential to happy re- 
sults in either case. It is not necessary, however, 
that the plan of the builder or the teacher be laid out 
on paper. Obviously it first must have some shape 
in the maker’s imagination before it can take form 
upon paper; and sometimes the memory must serve 
instead of paper. Many good structures have been 
erected without the drawing of a single visible line 
in advance. On one occasion a certain general, I 
think it was Stonewall Jackson, wanted a bridge 
built across a small stream within a very brief time. 
He called the master builder, a man of many years 
but of little learning— in books. He said, ‘‘ This 
bridge must be done by such and such a day. My 
architect will furnish you with plans.” The next 
evening the old builder was summoned again. The 
291
-P-A-G-E-304
  292 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
general said: ‘‘ Have you received the plans for that 
bridge?” “General,’’ replied the other, “ the 
bridge is done; I don’t know whether the pictur’ is 
or not.” 
This is not an argument against plans. The old 
bridge master had a plan, complete and ready, that 
he had wrought out many a time into visible symme- 
try and wondrous strength. He had a plan in mem- 
ory, and he was able to transfer it into abutment 
and girder and brace without any intermediary forms 
on paper. At first he alone saw the plan; at last 
everybody could see the bridge. 
The experienced teacher should be able to project 
a new plan promptly or to adapt an old plan quickly 
upon occasion, and to use either straight from the 
brain ; yet an old teacher will always find the process 
of formal plan-making exceedingly helpful, and the 
young teacher should conscientiously regard it as 
necessary. There must be something in the brain 
to begin with, or there can be nothing on the paper ; 
but it is remarkable how quickly ideas expand and 
reach out in proper relations when given a tentative 
form before the eye. Organization and elaboration 
go forward with encouraging facility at the point of 
a pen. 
It is believed that the following outlines will be 
helpful to the young teacher in the process of plan- 
making. First is given a skeleton outline, of general 
character, that may be filled out according to need 
 
-P-A-G-E-305
  
THE TEACHER’S LESSON PLAN 293 
or desire. Next are given three embodiments of the 
same skeleton: first, in a story for small children ; 
second, in a series of questions for larger pupils; 
third, in a series of topics for the upper grades or the 
high school. Each of the three complete forms is 
intended to be typical for the grades indicated, but 
suggestive rather than final. Simplicity of form and 
clearness of statement have been chief aims. Cer- 
tain troublesome terms, supposed to be technical but 
used by different authorities with different meanings, 
have been studiously avoided.

B. Outline of Class Work 
(For To-day) 
(1. Inrropuction) 
For several days past we have been studying about the 
Indians. Now we shall begin to study about the white 
people who made settlements in this country while the 
Indians were still here. Yesterday we finished making 
a little wigwam, which gives us an idea of the Indian 
houses; to-day I am going to tell you a story which will 
help you to understand how a white settler’s first house 
was built. 
(2. DEVELOPMENT) 
How Hans and Hannah Built their House 
Hans was a sturdy young German, and Hannah was 
his buxom young wife. In the midst of their honeymoon 
they left their old home in Pennsylvania to seek a new 
home in the Valley of Virginia. In company with many 
of their friends, who were also seeking new homes, they 
journeyed slowly southward. Such things as pots and 
kettles, saws and axes, corn and potatoes were hauled 
in wagons; and cows and extra horses were led along on 
foot. Hans had two strong young horses, named Kit and 
Barney, hitched to his new wagon; and he drove at the 
head of the long procession.  
-P-A-G-E-308
  296 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
Crossing the Potomac River a few miles above Harper’s 
Ferry, the party followed an old Indian trail up the 
beautiful Shenandoah Valley, past the places where 
Winchester, Woodstock, and New Market now stand. 
They continued moving up the Valley for four days. 
Some Indians were occasionally seen, but they were all 
friendly. Once in a while cabins of white settlers were 
passed, but they were few; for the time of which we speak 
was long ago. George Washington, who afterwards was 
a surveyor in the Valley for Lord Fairfax, was at this time 
just eight or ten years old; and Daniel Boone, who after- 
wards hunted through the Valley, was a little chap of only 
five or six. 
On the evening of the fourth day, as the sun went down 
behind the high mountains in the west, Hans pulled up 
the lines and said “‘Whoa !”’ to Kit and Barney, and they 
stopped beside a big spring of water that gushed out 
between two huge limestone rocks. 
“Here,” said Hans, “we are going to build our house.” 
“Ja,” exclaimed Hannah, “‘sehr gut, Hans,” which Hans 
understood to mean ‘‘All right, Hans, I’ll stand by you.” 
They were near the place where Harrisonburg now 
stands; and the other members of the party selected 
home sites not far away. Until the cabins could be 
finished each family slept in its wagon, under the big 
wagon cover, which resembled a tent. The weather was 
warm, for it was early May. The forest was beautiful 
in its many shades of green; the birds sang sweetly among 
the branches; bees hummed over the wild flowers; and 
squirrels leaped from tree to tree. 
Early the next morning Hans and Hannah were at work. 
First they cleared off a good-sized space of ground near 
 
-P-A-G-E-309
  THE TEACHER’S LESSON PLAN 297 
the spring, and drove in four strong stakes at the places 
where they intended to set the four corners of their house. 
By this time it was ten o’clock, and Hannah began to 
cook dinner; but Hans took his ax and began to cut down 
some nice straight trees, which were about as large around 
as a two-gallon bucket. After dinner Hannah took hold 
of one end of the long cross-cut saw, and she and Hans 
sawed the felled trees into long logs. Some of these logs 
were 20 feet long, and were intended for the sides of the 
house; most of the others were 16 feet long, and were 
intended for the ends of the house. 
Hans continued to fell trees and, with Hannah’s help, 
to saw them up, all the afternoon, and during the next 
two days. By that time they had about 40 of the longer 
logs, and about the same number of the shorter ones. 
The fourth day Hans took Kit and Barney and dragged 
the logs to the place that was already staked off for the 
house. He arranged the logs in four piles: the longer 
ones in two piles, on opposite sides of the house site; the 
shorter ones in two piles, at opposite ends of the house 
site. I’ll show you the arrangement here on the black- 
board. 
By this time the other members of the party were also 
ready to build their houses; but it was agreed among 
them that Hans and Hannah should have their house put 
up first. Accordingly, on an appointed day all the men 
came early in the morning to help Hans build the house; 
and some of the women also came to help Hannah cook 
a big dinner. 
Four men, who were very skillful with axes, took their 
sharp axes in their hands and stood at the places where 
Hans and Hannah had driven the four stakes. These  
-P-A-G-E-310
  298 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
stakes, you remember, showed just where the four corners 
of the house were to be. These four men were called 
“corner-men.” It was their business to notch the ends 
of the logs and fit them together at the corners of the house, 
and to keep the corners straight as the house went up. 
It was the business of the other men, most of them, to 
bring the logs and hand them up to the corner-men. 
When the house got up above a man’s shoulders, the logs 
were rolled up on long, strong poles, laid slanting up from 
the ground. These poles were called skids. 
A few of the men were put to making puncheons and 
clapboards. We shall see after a little what puncheons 
and clapboards were. 
I have been trying to find out the names of the four 
corner-men, whose sharp axes made the white chips fly 
whenever a log was handed or pushed up to them. Al- 
though I cannot be certain in this case, I think their names 
may have been George Bowman, Peter Showalter, Daniel 
Heatwole, and John Burkholder. These have been 
familiar names about Harrisonburg for many years. 
Some cabins in those early days had only the ground 
for a floor; but Hans and Hannah decided to have a wood 
floor in theirs. Accordingly, when the first round of logs 
next the ground was securely in place, notches were cut 
into the two side logs at regular distances, and into these 
notches were fitted the ends of strong cross-timbers. 
These cross-timbers were called “sleepers.” They lay 
near the ground and held up the floor. The floor con- 
sisted of puncheons, laid close together across the sleepers. 
Now, the puncheons were heavy, rough boards, or slabs, 
split out of logs. They were smoothed somewhat with 
axes, but they were at best very rough and uneven. You 
 
-P-A-G-E-311
  THE TEACHER’S LESSON PLAN 299 
can well imagine how many splinters Hans might have got 
into his feet by walking over such a floor barefooted. 
Puncheons made a strong floor, but one that was very 
full of ups and downs. All the stools and chairs had to 
be made with three legs only; because nothing with four 
legs, unless it was a cat or a dog, could stand steady. 
When the puncheons dried out and shrunk up, the cracks 
between them were wide enough for a rat to go through. 
A door was made in the side of the house by sawing out 
short pieces of the logs, one above the other. At each 
side of the doorway a flat piece of timber was set up and 
fastened to the ends of the logs with strong wooden pins, 
driven in after holes were bored with an auger. These 
upright pieces not only made a frame or facing for the 
door, but also held the sawed-off logs in their places. 
A similar opening, not quite so high, but about twice as 
wide, was made at one end of the cabin. This was for 
the fireplace and chimney. At another place a block was 
sawed out of a single log. The small opening thus made 
was afterwards covered with a piece of paper well greased 
with lard. What do you suppose this was? It was the 
window. Glass could not be had, and the greased paper, 
which let in a little light, was used instead. 
When the walls of the house were about ten feet high, 
the end logs were made shorter each round. This drew 
the side logs in toward the center. At the same time, 
each pair of side logs was higher than the preceding pair. 
At last a single log rested along the center, from end to 
end, higher than all the others. This was called the ridge 
pole. 
The house was now ready for the roof, and the men who 
had been making clapboards had a large pile of them  
-P-A-G-E-312
300 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
ready. Clapboards are big shingles. They are split 
out of straight logs, just like shingles or barrel staves, but 
are not shaved smooth, with a drawing knife, as shingles 
and staves are. The clapboards were laid on the roof, 
one layer after another. They did not fit together very 
well, neither did they lie flat and even everywhere; but 
they were fastened down with heavy poles laid on top of 
them, and they had to lie still. A clapboard roof was the 
fashionable thing in early pioneer days. It was not smooth 
or pretty, but it kept out all of the rain and most of the 
snow. 
While the men were splitting out the clapboards they 
cast aside a great many small pieces of timber. These 
were now cut into proper sizes and driven into the cracks 
between the logs of the house. The cracks were then 
filled up with mud. This kept out the wind and cold 
until the house got old and dry; then the cold wind would 
often whistle in through a hundred cracks at once; and 
sometimes, of a winter’s night, when Hans and Hannah 
were asleep, the little flakes of snow would sift in and make 
white figures all over the rough puncheon floor. 
The chimney to the house was also built of wood. It 
was lined around the fireplace with flat stones, and was 
well daubed over with mud. It was not so safe against 
fire as a stone chimney, but otherwise it was good enough. 
Many a time, when Hans was working out in the ‘“‘new- 
ground,” he would keep his eye on the little wooden 
chimney ; and when he would see the smoke come rolling 
out in a big cloud he would know that Hannah was cooking 
dinner or supper; and he would say to himself, “I guess 
I'd better go to the house.”

To-morrow you may begin building a little house. You

When it is finished I will tell you what kind of furniture

B. Outline of Class Work 
(For To-day) 
(1. Inrropuction) 
Yesterday we studied the life and work of Eli Whitney, 
who, by his great invention, made cotton “king” ; to-day 
we shall get acquainted with Robert Fulton, who succeeded 
in making every great river in our land a highway of travel 
and commerce. 
(2. DEvELOPMENT) 
1. In what State was Fulton born, Mary? (Penn.) 
2. In what county of that State? (Lancaster) 
3. In what year? (1765) 
4. Of what nationality was Fulton’s 
father, John? (Irish) 
You have answered correctly. Now listen to this: 
Fulton, an Irishman, was born in a county of Germans; 
but the county, as well as the State, has an English name; 
and the year was 1765, the very one in which the British 
Stamp Act was passed. 
5. Why did Fulton, as a boy, have to depend upon 
himself, Jane? 
6. What effect did this likely have upon his character. 
Thomas?
-P-A-G-E-315
  THE TEACHER’S LESSON PLAN 303 
7. Why was he so anxious, after a while, to go to Eng- 
land, Susan ? 
8. Tell us of another famous man he met in England. 
9. What plan did he conceive as he watched the canal 
boats, George? 
10. Is it not strange that Fulton, the artist, should have 
thought of undertaking such a difficult mechanical task ? 
11. Whose invention did he propose to utilize in his 
boat, Edna? 
12. Do you think that Fulton had ever heard of a steam- 
boat before? 
13. Now, William, I want you to go to the blackboard 
and write down in three lines three difficulties that Fulton 
had to overcome. 
(a. Lack of confidence on the part of the public) 
(b. The actual construction of the boat) 
(c. Lack of money) 
14. Which of these difficulties was overcome last, 
Flora? 
15. Which had to be overcome first ? 
16. Who helped Fulton to overcome this one, Frank? 
Notice: Two Roberts, one with brains, the other with 
money, and both with a will, made a strong combination. 
17. A banker in New York also furnished some money : 
Why do we not know his name, Anna? 
18. What did Fulton name his boat, James? 
19. On what river did he test it? 
20. Between what two cities was the trial trip made, 
Grace? . 
21. What is the distance? 
22. In how many hours did the Clermont make the trip, 
Ralph?
-P-A-G-E-316
304 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
23. This was an average of about how many miles an 
hour ? 
24. Could you walk five miles an hour? Suppose you 
ran? 
25. If a sailboat sometimes made ten miles an hour, 
what advantage had the Clermont, Nora? 
26. Does not this suggest to us the chief value of the 
steamboat? It can always be counted on, wind or calm, 
up stream or down. 
27. I think you ought to remember the year in which 
the Clermont made its successful trial trip: It was just 
200 years after Jamestown was settled: Yes, 1807. Now, 
1807 was also the year in which Robert E. Lee was born. 
Moreover, in 1807 Congress passed a famous law called 
the Embargo, which you will learn about later. 
(3. Concusion) 
Richard, you may go to the board and write down the 
qualities in Fulton’s boat that made it a success. The 
class may make suggestions. 
Now, Lucy, you may go to the board and write down 
the qualities in Fulton himself that made him a success. 
The class may make suggestions. 
Which set of qualities was the more important? Why? 
To-morrow I shall call upon some one to tell us the story 
of Fulton. Then, for the remainder of the period, we 
shall talk about James Rumsey and others who invented 
steamboats before 1807.

(For To-day) 
(1. Inrropuction) 
Having devoted the preceding lesson to the prosperity 
and material development of our country during Jackson’s 
eight-year ‘reign,’ we shall now take up for study the 
depressing reaction that fell upon the early days of Jack- 
son’s successor. In accordance with this plan, particular 
topics were assigned yesterday to the different members 
of the class; and the reports upon these topics will now 
be heard.

Having studied this crisis somewhat, let us next take 
up for consideration the crisis of 1873. If we can under- 
stand these two, or any two, we can probably understand

all crises ; for while each crisis has its own peculiar features, 
all crises are in the main alike. They all come when times 
are good, which usually means that business credit is 
strained to the breaking point ; and when loss of confidence 
in men means loss of money — perhaps to millions.

CHAPTER XXIX 
THE TEACHER’S NEED TO KNOW BOOKS 
Ir should be one of the aims of the history teacher 
to introduce his pupils to books, magazines, pam- 
phlets, and other publications from which informa- 
tion on historical subjects may be obtained. A 
library is not enough ; a list of books is not enough ; 
the pupil needs to see the book, to handle it, to look 
into it, and to become familiar enough with it to 
remember something about it, or at least to remem- 
ber that there issuch abook. The teacher, therefore, 
must bring books into his class room and show them 
to his pupils, or go with the pupils into the library 
and guide them to the books. All this should not 
be necessary, to be sure, with experienced students ; 
but sometime or other it is necessary with almost 
every pupil. 
To be able to introduce his pupils to books, and 
to the best books, and to be able to answer all the 
questions of intelligent pupils regarding sources of 
information on this, that, and the other topic, the 
teacher needs to know books. 
Part of the business of every student in a normal 
school is to get acquainted with books. It would 
308 
 
-P-A-G-E-321
  THE TEACHER’S NEED TO KNOW BOOKS 309 
be of little use for a mechanic to have the most 
improved tools in his outfit if he did not know those 
tools were in existence. It would seem absurd for 
him not to know it. The teacher who does not 
know the existence of the best books in her special 
subject, even though these books may be in the 
library of her own school, is placed in a position no 
whit less absurd. In fact, such a teacher does not 
know her business, or the means at her hand for good 
work. 
It is the purpose, therefore, of this chapter to 
emphasize this need of the teacher to know books; 
and, in the second place, to help the teacher and the 
normal school student to get acquainted with some 
books that will be useful to them. No attempt is 
made to give a list of books on subject matter, but 
a select list of professional books and essays is sub- 
mitted. These publications not only give outlines 
of courses of study, present discussions of principles 
and tendencies in education, and suggest methods 
of instruction and study, but also contain lists of all 
sorts of books on all sorts of historical subjects. In 
short, through acquaintance with a few professional 
books the teacher will be introduced to numerous 
other books in which particular facts of history are 
collected. 
The list of books submitted is selective rather than 
exhaustive. It is made up mainly of books that may 
easily be obtained from the respective publishers,
-P-A-G-E-322
  310 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
and of reports contained in bound volumes of the 
proceedings of learned societies that should be found 
in every school library. In a number of instances 
descriptive notes have been appended, in the effort 
to give the reader a more definite notion of the scope 
or character of the publication.

Teachers are frequently called upon to give an 
estimate of this or that book; and in the selection of 
textbooks for his classes the teacher must form opin- 
ions as to the relative merits of different books, 
unless he is willing to be guided altogether by the 
statements of others. In the hope of suggesting some 
of the points to be considered in making up an esti- 
mate of a history textbook the following outline is 
submitted. 
Ovtiine ror Reviewine a TEXTBOOK IN History 
1. Name of author; exact title; name of publisher; place 
and date of publication. 
2. Your acquaintance with the book. — Have you used the 
book as a student or as a teacher, or as both? or have you only 
given it a hasty reading? 
3. The historical veracity of the book. — Is it accurate and 
fair?

to “ Note-Taking,’”’ by S. S. Seward, Jr. (Allyn & Bacon), and to 
“Scientific Book-Marking,”’ by John W. Wayland, in the Sewanee 
Review of April, 1913. These two treatises might be cited also in 
connection with Chapter XV and Chapter XXVII. 
 
-P-A-G-E-330
CHAPTER XXX 
THE TEACHER’S NEED TO KNOW HIMSELF 
PERHAPS no power can bestow upon the teacher 
the gift of seeing himself as others see him ; but it is 
quite possible for him to know in some degree 
whether his methods are good or bad; and which 
are good and which are bad. If he can know in 
a measure how his pupils see him, he should thereby 
be enabled to escape some blunders and to rid himself 
of at least a few foolish notions. 
It would doubtless help every teacher to get 
occasional frank criticisms from his maturer pupils. 
The teacher ought to learn just as much from his 
class as the class learnsfrom him. Mutual sympathy 
and confidence should be fostered, and no pupil 
should be afraid to express himself frankly and fully 
regarding the teacher’s manner and methods if the 
latter ask for such an expression. It is a confession 
of weakness or a false sense of pride sheltering in 
ignorance if the teacher feels that his dignity and 
influence would be endangered by taking his pupils 
into such a degree of confidence. 
I suspect, however, that in spite of this heart-to- 
heart talk the majority of my fellow teachers will 
318 
 
-P-A-G-E-331
    THE TEACHER’S NEED TO KNOW HIMSELF 319 
go ahead in the same old way, blissfully imagining 
either that they have no faults in their manners and 
methods or that their pupils are blind to such faults. 
Accordingly, to offer a little help in the matter, and 
at the same time to spare tender feelings, I am going 
to put down in this chapter a great many things that 
pupils have said about “other teachers.” This 
is done in the hope that we all may see ourselves and 
profit in some degree. 
For a number of years I have been collecting 
opinions that pupils have had concerning their 
teachers of history. Tabular statements of good 
points and bad points have been asked for in each 
case. Hundreds of different students, most of them 
of rather mature judgment, have been interviewed, 
and hundreds of different statements have been 
received. The majority of these statements, how- 
ever, fall into groups, a fact which shows that there 
are certain faults and virtues that are more or less 
common to our profession. All the statements sub- 
joined are actual ones, from the pupils themselves. 
They were all made regarding teachers of history. 
They all show thought; some poorer, some better, 
judgment. They all make us keenly aware that 
our pupils are watching us, and that they have 
opinions about us and our ways of doing things.
-P-A-G-E-332
  320 HOW TO TEACH AMERICAN HISTORY 
Bap Points THAT PUPILS HAVE OBSERVED IN History 
TEACHERS 
Not enough class discussion. 
Too much attention to small incidents. 
Not enough holidays celebrated. 
Not enough historical excursions. 
. Bad proportion in assignment of lessons: too long 
one oe and too short the next. 
6. Fails to emphasize historical geography enough. 
. 7. Cause and effect not sufficiently brought out. 
8. Does not know the subject. 
9. Not very enthusiastic over history. 
10. Dwells too long on the first part of the chapter, 
and not enough on the last. 
11. Too much stress on dates. 
12. Not enough daily demand upon the class regarding 
the assignment in the textbook. 
13. Not definite enough in making assignments. 
14. “We have to make our notebooks for you rather 
than for ourselves.” 
15. Reference readings stated too indefinitely. 
16. Not enough questions asked. 
17. Too few tests given. 
18. Very seldom speaks of current events. 
19. Reads stories instead of telling them. 
20. Test questions are too frequently “‘memory ques- 
tions” instead of “thought questions.” 
21. Questions are not interesting enough. 
22. Does not emphasize important points. 
23. Not enough reviews. 
24. Requiring the pupil to memorize, word for word, 
the matter of the text. SS eos 
 
-P-A-G-E-333
  
  THE TEACHER’S NEED TO KNOW HIMSELF 321 
25. Having the children recite the lesson assigned, 
without making any connection with what went before, 
and without giving any definite notion as to where the 
events occurred. 
26. Teaching the textbook only. 
27. Depending entirely upon the textbook. 
28. The same method every day. 
29. Using only questions given in the textbook. 
30. Accepting any answer the child may give. 
31. The teacher’s doing all the talking. 
32. Failing to explain what the child does not under- 
33. Using textbooks too difficult for the pupil. 
34. Having the forward pupils recite, but never giving 
the backward ones a chance. 
It is certainly to be hoped that no one teacher is 
guilty on all these different counts; but something 
in the catalogue may come close enough home to 
somebody to be helpful. The honest teacher will 
admit a fault when it is clearly shown against him ; 
and the earnest teacher will be glad for an opportunity 
to profit by somebody else’s observation. Whether 
we think that all the points scored above are “ bad 
points.” or not, they are at least interesting as coming 
from the pupil’s viewpoint. They are commended 
to the earnest consideration of those teachers of 
history who are anxious for improvement. 
So many things have been said, and so many things 
may be said, in criticism of the history teacher, that 
all of us should be glad when something is found

to strengthen his heart. It gives the heart new 
strength and life a larger aim, my fellow teachers, 
when those for whom we labor rise up and speak 
a word of praise. The hope and joy of every teacher 
are bound fast to the minds and hearts of his pupils. 
It would be wrong, therefore, to put down in cold 
type the list of criticisms given above, without 
presenting also some of the ‘ good points” put in 
balance with the adverse criticisms. In nearly every 
case investigated, the number of good points credited 
to the teacher exceeded the number of bad points 
charged against him. 
Whatever values may be attached to the various 
things enumerated below, it will certainly be allowed 
by even the most critical that many of them are 
desirable in a teacher of history or of anything else. 
An inspection of the list should help the teacher to 
get a few more ideas as to what the average pupil 
thinks worth while in his teacher.

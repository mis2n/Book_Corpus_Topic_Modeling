  PREFACE 
This book is an attempt to give a simple account of in- 
telligence testing and the results which have so far 
been achieved by the testing movement. It is designed 
for use as a text in a college course, and it is hoped 
that it will prove useful in serving as a guide to the 
thousands of teachers who are now becoming interested 
in the use of intelligence tests in their schools. 
The book is not a treatise on measurement in_educa- 
tion or psychology. For this purpose, we have already 
the valuable works of Thorndike, Rugg, and others. 
Nor does it deal with the technique of test construc- 
tion, which has been recently covered by McCall. Fur- 
thermore, it does not deal with educational tests, that 
is, with tests of achievement in school subjects, for in 
this field there are now many books. It is rather an 
attempt to tell the reader what is meant by intelli- 
gence testing, what means are employed to test general 
intelligence, and what results have been achieved. 
Part One is mainly historical and theoretical in 
nature. It shows the gradual evolution of the intelli- 
gence test and discusses some of the basic assumptions 
underlying the work. 
Part Two is a description of the various tests, indi- 
vidual and group, that are at present available. It 
aims to give the student a survey of the various methods 
by means of which intelligence is tested. The class- 
room instructor will supplement here by giving or dem-

onstrating to his class the different types of tests. In 
some classes practical work with the tests in schools 
will be feasible and desirable. 
Part Three summarizes the main results of intelli- 
gence testing. Up to the present time this material has 
been scattered in numerous periodicals, monographs and 
books. Many of these are inaccessible to the student. 
The author has attempted to bring this material to- 
gether and indicate what conclusions can be drawn at 
the present time. The numerous references in this sec- 
tion may be utilized by the instructor as assignments 
for further study by his students. 
Bibliographical references follow each _ chapter. 
These are arranged in alphabetical order according to 
the name of the writer. In the text, the date of publi- 
cation of the work referred to is put in parenthesis after 
the writer’s name. 
Throughout the book the influence of Thorndike’s 
work will be obvious to the student. No one man has 
had more to do with stimulating the measurement move- 
ment in this country than Professor Thorndike. It is 
fitting, therefore, that the author should acknowledge 
his indebtedness in this place, both for the inspiration 
received from Professor Thorndike’s writings and for his 
personal advice and encouragement. He also wishes 
to acknowledge the very valuable help rendered by 
Professor Peter Sandiford of Toronto University, who 
read the original manuscript and made many important 
suggestions. Also, he takes pleasure in acknowledging 
here the great assistance rendered by his wife in pre- 
paring the manuscript for the printer and in seeing the 
book through the press. 
Intelligence testing is of recent growth, and the ac-

complishments of the last fifteen years have been great. 
Nevertheless, we stand merely at the beginning of an 
important chapter in the measurement of human be- 
havior. The future will see new and more accurate 
tests. It will see tests applied for purposes now un- 
thought of. The types of individuals tested, which form 
the chapter headings of Part Three, will undoubtedly 
increase in numbers. A future edition of such a book 
as this may well have such chapter headings as ‘‘ The. 
Immigrant”; ‘‘ The Voter”; ‘‘ The Applicant for a 
Marriage License”; ‘‘ The Candidate for Public 
Office’; ‘‘ The Civil Servant ”; and so forth. For in- 
telligence is one of the aspects of an individual’s per- 
sonality that is of great importance in modern civilized 
life. And now that we are able to measure it with a 
fair degree of accuracy, intelligence tests will find a 
wider and wider field of application.

CHAPTER I 
EARLY HISTORY OF INTELLIGENCE 
TESTING 
Although the intelligence test, as we know it today, is 
of recent growth, it is, nevertheless, interesting to trace 
its early history, and to find some of the causes which 
ted to its development. Likeso many of the results of — 
_have appeared as the fulfillment of a need that existed. 
( oie fosupply 2a 10 sae And the science 
of psychology had progressed far enough in the prob- 
lem of mental testing to be ready to fill this need when 
the time came. We may thus think of these two as- 
pects, the theoretical interest and the practical need, 
and we may further consider them as brought to a 
focus in the work of Binet, as exemplified by his con- 
struction of the Binet-Simon Scale. Let us call the 
theoretical interest in the problem the psychological in- 
terest and the practical interest the sociological interest. 
The following diagram will help to illustrate this pres- 
entation of the subject. 
The left side of our diagram represents the forces, 
practical and theoretical, leading up to the work of 
Binet, and the right side the modern development of 
the work, which we have represented as brought to a 
tocus by Binet. The upper half of the diagram rep- 
resents the practical field, and the lower the theoretical.

  4 INTELLIGENCE TESTING 
- The sociological trend stimulated the psychologist to 
devise means to fill the needs of society and once these 
means were supplied, we see the application of these to 
many different groups of individuals. The psychologi- 
cal trend gave the psychologist the tools with which to 
work and once these were adapted to the new demands,

we see an extension of these kinds of tools in the shape 
of innumerable scales and tests, a few of which only we 
have indicated in our diagram. 
By bringing these trends to a focus in the work of 
Binet, we do not mean to suggest that he was the only 
worker in the field, nor that his influence was the only 
influence leading to the development of scales for men- 
tal measurement. There were many workers and many 
currents of interest, so many, indeed, that our diagram 
would become too complicated if we tried to include 
them all. {It was, however, the work of Binet during 
the years 1905 to rorr, around which the main interest 
centered, and it was his scale that first won universal 
recognition asa practical means for the measurement 
of mental ability. 
’ In this chapter we shall trace briefly the two influ- 
ences, the sociological and the psychological, that led to

  EARLY HISTORY : 
the establishment of scales for the measurement of in- 
telligence. The work of Binet and of the other workers 
who followed him, and the results of the application of 
their tests will be taken up in succeeding chapters. 
A. THE SocroLocicaAL TREND 
By this we mean those forces in society directing our 
attention to the defective and delinquent classes. These 
classes first aroused the interest of the psychologist be- 
cause of their peculiarities in mental make-up. This 
is particularly true of the feebleminded, and the appli- 
cation of the first scales for measuring—intelligence—was 
largely restricted*to them. It might be well, therefore, 
fo-trace—briefly” the attitude of society towards this 
group of individuals. 
Ancient Period. — We have little information as to 
the feebleminded in ancient Greece and Rome. Ex- 
posure of undesirable children was practised and at 
certain periods and in certain places was common. In 
general the obviously physically defective were exposed, 
and, to the extent that feeblemindedness is accompanied 
by physical defect, the feebleminded would thus be 
eliminated. The great mass of feebleminded, sound in 
body, would escape. During the period of the Roman 
Empire exposure was not so common, and the cynic has 
suggested that, had the old Roman custom more com- 
monly prevailed, the world might have been spared the 
excesses of a Nero or a Commodus. 
Medieval Period. — The emphasis of Christianity 
upon charity and mercy caused a decided change in 
the attitude of society towards the physically and men- 
tally defective. All classes of the ‘‘ despised and re-

PREFACE 
This book has been written by men who know at 
first hand the whole problem they are trying to describe, 
interpret, and solve. It contains material that is prac- 
tical. Its object is to deal with some of the great 
problems, leaving other equally important problems to 
be investigated and solved by the teacher in the school- 
room. It is not a manual which promises to suggest 
the way out of every difficulty, but it does aim to in- 
spire the student of rural sociology to appreciate the 
importance of a community school as a center for im- 
planting American standards and ideals. 
The authors have been diligent students of rural life 
and rural prospects, and they believe most whole- 
heartedly that the rural school should be adapted’ to 
the homes and the interests of the pupils who go to 
school to receive an education sufficient and complete 
for perfect living in America. 
This book will be of equal value to the Beoale of the 
community and to the teacher. It does not lose sight 
of the fact that every person in a community has a valu- 
able part as a contributor to human welfare, and this 
co-operation and sympathy become the means to posi- 
tive and desirable ends. 
The reading of this book is convincing evidence that 
America needs to emphasize even more than in the

past the education of every child, the children of the 
farm equally with the children of the city, and, further- 
more, that this task may become one of inspiration and 
enrichment if it is pursued in the proper spirit and with 
intelligence and devotion. TOROS RTS

INTRODUCTION 
These authors, who have had unusual success not only 
in managing their own rural schools but also in the 
supervision of rural schools, have together written a 
book which should find much favor among persons who 
are interested in the country school. The authors have 
selected the most important problems of management 
which the rural teacher must constantly meet; they 
have presented these problems in a practical manner, so 
that this book will be a helpful and inspiring guide to 
the teacher occupied with the difficult task of managing 
a country school. 
The teacher in the one-teacher rural school meets 
problems that are peculiar to the conditions existing in 
the country neighborhood, often more involved and diffi- 
cult than fall to the lot of teachers in larger and more 
specialized schools. This book groups these problems 
logically and treats them simply and fully. 
In the first group a sympathetic analysis is given to 
the problems. The initial step is to understand the 
difficult problems of rural life and to have an apprecia- 
tion of the worth of the people of the farm communities. 
The second group of problems deals with the usual 
forms of organization and administration of rural school 
districts and their affairs. In this connection the rela- 
tion of the country teacher to her superior officers and

the use of records and reports are clearly set forth. 
Successful management of this phase of the work is the 
second logical step toward success. 
The third group of problems deals with the school- 
house and its equipment. Here carelessness and indif- 
ference on the part of the rural community are often 
evident. However, these frequently arise from a lack 
of information on the part of the people themselves. 
The teacher who is prepared to point out the improve- 
ments which should be made and to lead in organizing 
the community to secure them will usually meet with 
a hearty response. This is another important step 
toward success in teaching a country school. 
The last group of problems deals with the most im- 
portant factor, the teacher herself. A county superin- 
tendent in a Western State said to the writer: “If I were 
to take you to the best rural school in my county, I 
would take you to a sod schoolhouse in a backward com- 
munity. The best school in the county is there because 
the best teacher in the county is there.” 
In connection with the work of the teacher, careful 
treatment has been given to that most difficult task of 
organizing a satisfactory daily and yearly program 
under the conditions where one teacher is required to 
teach all the classes in all the subjects in the eight 
elementary grades. The recommendations given here 
are the result of careful tests carried out in rural school 
laboratories. 
The subjects in this last group show the modern trend 
in education. Physical education, the warm lunch,

INTRODUCTION xi 
health education, citizenship, industrial work, types of 
teaching, and measuring the results of teaching are here 
presented as well as the es and the personal 
growth of the teacher. 
The reading of this book will give the teacher a new 
value of her relation to her community and will show 
her in a practical way how she can be of the greatest 
service. ‘ Macy CampseELt,

  RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
CHAPTER I 
THE RURAL TEACHER AND THE COMMUNITY 
The teacher is a part of the community in which she 
works. She takes her place with the mother in the 
home and the pastor in the church as a moulder of 
character. When doing her work completely she wields 
an influence that affects not only the individual child, 
but also future society. The teacher’s leadership in 
any community is an important factor in its progress, 
but in order that the teacher in a rural or small-town 
school may attain a real leadership she must possess the 
following characteristics: (1) Have an appreciation for 
the beauty of the country. (2) Have an appreciation 
for country people and their problems. (3) Under- 
stand the progress made in rural life. (4) Realize the 
advantages in working with country children. (5) Be 
in love with her job. 
An Appreciation for the Beauty of the Country.— 
One who lives in the open country resides in the midst 
of Nature’s crowning effort. So much of the best in the 
world seems to have come from thé fields, gardens, and 
hillsides. Truths spoken by the Master Poet come to 
us exhaling the odors of the open country. His stories 
are often of sowers, husbandmen, herdsmen; His similes 
and illustrations so often deal with the common and 
familiar beauty of the fields. It was on a hillside that 
1 
   
-P-A-G-E-20
ee eee 
2 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
He preached His greatest sermon, and when in the last 
agony He sought a place to meet His God, it was the 
quiet of a garden. Of all places in the world where life 
  
  NATURE’S HAUNTS 
can be lived to its fullest and freest, where it can be 
met in its greatest variety and beauty, there is none to 
equal the open country. 
“God made the country, and man made the town. 
What wonder, then, that health and virtue, gifts 
That can alone make sweet the bitter draught 
That life holds out to all, should most abound 
And least be threatened in the fields and groves!” 
—COWPER. 
There is virtue in country houses, in gardens and orchards, in 
fields, streams, and groves, in rustic recreations and plain man- 
ners, that neither cities nor universities enjoy.—ALcort.
-P-A-G-E-21
    THE TEACHER AND THE COMMUNITY 3 
Country life rather spoils one for the so-called lux- 
uries. A farmer may indeed have only a small cash 
income, but at least he eats at the first table. He may 
have the sweetest of milk, the freshest of eggs, or the 
ripest of fruit; all these things, though he must work 
and sweat for them, the farmer may have in unmeasured 
abundance and without a thought of what they cost. 
Country Life Is Ever Changing.—One of the greatest 
curses of mill and factory work of all kinds is its mo- 
notony; the same process repeated hour after hour, and 
day after day. In the country there is indeed monot- 
onous work, but rarely monotony. No task continues 
very long, everything changes infinitely with the sea- 
sons. Nature, disliking monotony, is ever changing and 
restless, bringing us a storm to drive the haymakers 
from their fields, sending rain to stop the ploughing, 
or a frost to hurry the corn-harvest. Everything is full 
of adventure! A man who has been a farmer for two 
hours at the mowing must suddenly turn blacksmith, 
and tinker with wrench and hammer when his machine 
breaks down. Later in the day he becomes dairyman, 
gardener, poultryman, and merchant. There is no kind 
of wheat but is grist to his mill; there is no knowledge 
that he cannot use. Who is so free to be a citizen as 
he? Who is so free to take his part in town meetings 
and serve his State in some one of the many offices 
which form the great organization of our common- 
wealth? 
“In view of such circumstances and opportunities, 
ife in the country should be, and could be made, the 
best and most complete life possible to a human being. 
Country life is the best cradle of the race. To have a 
good home and rear a family in the heart of a great city 
   
-P-A-G-E-22
  4 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
is well-nigh impossible for the average laboring man. 
The struggle for existence is too fierce and the oppor- 
tunity in childhood and youth for self-expression and 
initiative is too meager. The environment is too vast, 
complex, and overwhelming, with nothing worth while 
for the child to do. Individuals may stand, but gen- 
erations will slip on such an increased plane of life. 
From this point it can be truly said, we think that God 
made the country while man made the town. The 
real, vital possibilities of country life are without num- 
ber. The surface attractions of the city are most allur- 
ing. A focussing of the public mind upon the problem, 
its pros and cons, will, it is hoped, turn the scales with- 
out delay in favor of country life and its substantial 
benefits.” * 
Appreciation of Nature and Farm Life—The rural 
teacher works in an environment rich in living things. 
She should develop a respect and love for the most com- 
mon in her surroundings. She is to be a teacher of 
pupils coming from Nature’s haunts, and to interest 
them she herself must first be informed of Nature’s 
work. To know the common birds, their habits, songs, 
and nesting places, to know the common trees and in- 
' spire the child to love and appreciate their beauty and 
usefulness, to know something about common farm 
practices, the production of farm crops, the raising of 
animals, their care and use; to have a knowledge of 
farm machinery in common use, all these and many 
more interesting things should be a part of the rural 
teacher’s training in order that she may teach her sub- 
ject-matter with a knowledge of her surroundings and 
motivate her teaching by use of first-hand material. 
* From Kennedy’s Rural Life and the Rural School.
-P-A-G-E-23
    THE TEACHER AND THE COMMUNITY 5 
In discussing this thought in the Jowa Manual of 
Methods, C. P. Colegrove says: 
No teacher should fail to give Nature Study and Elementary 
Agriculture a place in the work of the school. The great ma- 
jority of the pupils in our elementary schools will join the army 
of industrial workers in field, shop, and factory. Agriculture is 
the dominant industry of our State. If teachers are discreet 
and enthusiastic in teaching these subjects they can make them 
a means of helping the interest and efficiency of the instruction 
in all other subjects in'the course. These subjects should not 
be considered as extras, but as an essential part of the school 
program. They should serve to interest pupils in farm work 
and farm life, to connect school life and home life, to train 
pupils in habits of observation of common things, and create in 
pupils a respect for intelligent industry and an appreciation of 
labor industrial processes as factors in our civilization. 
Appreciation for Country People and Their Problems. 
~The rural teacher must realize that she is working 
with a group of individuals, not differing fundamentally 
from other people, but differing in the nature of their 
work, their home life, and their social contacts. The 
farmer works by himself with his family, and his\con- 
tacts with other people are less than in the case of urban 
residents. The rural teacher should understand this 
and prepare herself so that she will possess the following: 
An Open Mind.—Among these problems the teacher 
should interest herself in the social life of the com- 
munity. The high cost of production as compared to 
the profits, the best kind of school, the public highway 
question, the church and its decadent condition, taxes 
on land as compared to tax-free securities and tenantry, 
are a few of the many troublesome problems of the 
farmer that the rural teacher should understand. She 
should know that such problems are difficult to solve.
-P-A-G-E-24
  6 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
She must realize that the farmer alone makes his de- 
cisions independently and becomes more or less conser- 
.vative. Likewise she must realize that rural people are 
close to Nature and the elements; that drought and 
flood, frost and hot wind, army-worm and chinch-bug 
all are causes of discouragement, and often destroy in a 
few days future prospects and shatter forward-looking 
plans. 
A_ Willingness to Co-operate——The rural-minded 
teacher will strive to organize the farmers and their 
wives into parent-teachers’ associations, community 
centers, or neighborhood clubs, or make use of what- 
ever organization may be at hand for the purpose of 
studying the farm home problems. No place is so well 
adapted for the solution of the farmers’ problems as 
the school. It is an institution that belongs to all the 
people of the community, and the wide-awake teacher 
will see that she can render a great service to her people 
by bringing them together both for social contact and 
for the serious consideration of vital problems. 
A Sympathetic Attitude ——The teacher must recognize 
that the farm mother faces many problems peculiar to 
her farm home, and these problems must be met and 
solved. Around this farm home hinge all the major 
activities of the farm. The housewife becomes a nurse 
and a physician. She is an adviser and a copartner 
with her husband in every activity. The rural teacher 
must understand this and appreciate that when she 
deals with a farm mother she is dealing with a busy 
woman, and that whatever she can do to assist her will 
help in the solution of the rural problem. 
A Desire to Live in the Neighborhood.—The teacher 
will choose to live in the neighborhood where she teaches.
-P-A-G-E-25
  THE TEACHER AND THE COMMUNITY iG 
She will visit the homes, get acquainted with her patrons, 
and learn the environment of the boys and girls of her 
school../Many teachers fail because they do not under- 
stand the home environment of their children. Children 
ofttimes display peculiar attitudes that teachers cannot 
understand until they see the home, converse with the 
father and mother, and catch a glimpse of the surround- 
ings and a touch of the atmosphere to which children 
are subjected outside of school hours. 
Understand the Progress Made in Rural Life.—The 
rural teacher must appreciate that country life has 
progressed. Many who write on ‘“‘rural life” leave the 
impression that life in the country is not to be desired. 
Rural life has its difficulties, but life anywhere will no 
doubt have its drawbacks. Life depends upon the in- 
dividual, whether in the heart of the city or in the quiet 
country place. To-day, “rural life” is not what it was 
in pioneer days, with its lack of labor-saving devices, 
with inadequate means of transportation, with poor 
schools, poor roads, no telephones, no mail delivery, and 
no improved homes. On the contrary, every means, in 
a physical way, that can aid enjoyment has been util- 
ized. Labor-saving devices have been introduced until 
nearly every step in the production of any crop is done 
by machinery. In one State an automobile to every 
five persons makes it possible for the farmer to keep in 
close touch with the world. Better schools are being 
established for rural children. Since 1912 many con- 
solidated schools have been organized in the United 
States, which points toward the fact that the farmer de- 
mands a better type of school. Roads are being im- 
proved, and soon the farmer will be out of the mud.

The Federal Aid Plan Gets Results.—The road im- 
provement which has already been accomplished under 
the Federal Aid Plan shows that it is effective in get- 
ting results. During the five years 1919 to 1923, there 
were completed under this plan 23,285 miles of hard- 
surfaced roads of various types costing a total of $407,- 
446,910, or an average of $17,500 per mile. Of this 
total cost the Federal Government paid $233,558,999, 
approximately $10,000 per mile. 
With a telephone in every home, the farmer knows 
what is going on around him, and cannot be isolated as 
he once was. What would our forefathers have thought 
if they could have had their mail delivered every day, 
and in that mail received not only one paper but several 
daily papers, magazines, and market reports? 
Rural homes are found provided with all the modern 
conveniences that do away with much of the drudgery 
of the farm women, making it possible for them to en- 
joy themselves with their city sisters.

THE TEACHER AND THE COMMUNITY 13 
* Realization of the Advantage in Working with Rural 
Children.—The greatest teacher is experience. Country 
children acquis Enowldge-ol profaction, learn the 
habits of the birds and wild animals, discover insects 
and plant diseases that injure the crops, and learn how 
  
  A LESSON IN GEOGRAPHY FROM NATURE’S TEXT-BOOK 
to destroy pests. They are taught and trained, in fact 
grow up, with the implements of farm husbandry, and 
obtain more or less skill in all the farm operations that 
bring wealth to the family. ‘The country child grows 
in an atmosphere of work which, if not carried to ex- 
treme, is one of his greatest blessings in later life. 
Chores to be done, errands to be run, little odd jobs to 
be finished, all these have a part in the development 
of a growing child. He grows not only physically
-P-A-G-E-32
14 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
strong, but he has a chance to develop judgment, tact, 
reason, and self-reliance. Rural children appreciate 
what is done for them more than other groups because 
their opportunities of receiving attention from other 
sources are limited. 
Children should be led by the teacher out into Nature, 
set in the midst of loveliness, lost in the beauty and 
grandeur of Nature’s glee. Those of us who teach 
should open the child’s mind to his natural existence, 
develop his sense of responsibility and of self-dependence, 
train him to respect the resources of the earth, teach 
him the obligations of citizenship, interest him sym- 
pathetically in the occupations of man, quicken his re- 
sponse to human life in general, and touch his imagina- 
tion with the spiritual forces of the world. 
In Love with Her Job.—The hired man who drops 
his axe when dinner is called, even though he may have 
the weapon raised high in the air ready to strike, is 
not really in love with his job. The workman who wears 
out his watch-chain pulling his timepiece out of his 
pocket when quitting time approaches is not thinking 
of how much he can accomplish for his employer. Like- 
wise the rural teacher who keeps her mind upon Friday 
afternoon’s three-thirty period and upon the week-end 
activities in her home community is not in love with 
her job. 
A Task Worthy of Best Effort—The teacher in the 
humblest one-room school must appreciate that her 
task is important and worth while. She must realize 
that she is dealing with the future citizens of a great 
commonwealth; with boys and girls that deserve the 
best training, because they are to become the future 
citizens of a free America. They must receive proper 
instruction under the direction of a sincere, honest, en-
-P-A-G-E-33
THE TEACHER AND THE COMMUNITY 15 
terprising teacher. She must realize that parents are 
watching with deep interest concerning the work of their 
children in the school. She must be willing to sacrifice 
time and do more than is absolutely required in order 
that greater ends may be attained. She must invest 
herself as working capital and so work each day that 
when the day is finished she can feel that she has done 
all in her power to help her children. 
Understand and Love Children.—A teacher must have 
a clear understanding of children. She must see the 
loveliness of child character, its sweet sincerity, its 
wealth of affection, its power of faith. She must see 
the marvel of an unfolding life like the unfolding of the 
petals of a beautiful flower that finally blossoms into 
complete beauty to add to the world’s enjoyment. 
What a joy to be instrumental in taking a little untrained 
child that is more or less crude in habit and by precept 
and example direct him through the various metamorphic 
changes that must come, and at last see him approach 
the teacher’s ideal of manhood and womanhood. 
Back Pay.—This wonderful development of the child 
is accomplished by the teacher when she sees clearly 
his possibilities, is touched with a compassion that will 
not let her rest until her love for him has found satis- 
faction and her faith in him has come to fruition. 
There is no other task given to man that bears such 
heavy responsibility as that of being a teacher. On the 
other hand, there is no bonus, no pension, no compen- 
sation or back pay so satisfying as the hearty hand- 
shake of some student who says to his former teacher: 
“You are the one who gave me the inspiration that 
started me on my road to success. To you and to the 
ideals that you gave me back there in that little one- 
room school, I owe all that I ara.”

CHAPTER II 
RURAL INSTITUTIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS 
Section I. FARM ORGANIZATIONS 
Rural life is influenced by many organizations and 
institutions. These agencies are at work, each in its 
own sphere, assisting in no small way to recast the social, 
economic, and educational life of rural people. The 
home, the church, and the school are the fundamental 
institutions in society. Around these basic institutions 
many other organizations have arisen to supplement 
their efforts but not to supplant them. Each agency 
is striving to do its work with the one ultimate aim in 
mind—the uplift of rural life and rural institutions. 
These agencies are legion. The Farm Bureau, Grange, 
County Y. M. and Y. W. C. A., Boy Scouts, Camp Fire 
Girls, Boys’ and Girls’ Clubs (Project Work), Dairy Test 
Association, co-operative organizations, Farmers’ Equity 
and Farmers’ Union constitute a few of the many ex- 
cellent organizations that are at work in the rural field. 
The county agent and the county home-demonstration 
agent have also done much to mould better ideals in the 
country. 
These organizations and individuals are not all ac- 
tive in any one locality, but it would be difficult to find 
a rural school district in the Middle West where at least 
one or more did not function to a greater or less degree. 
The Relation of the Teacher to These Organizations. 
—The teacher is a leader. She becomes, because of her 
position, the one individual in the community that 
20
-P-A-G-E-39
INSTITUTIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS 21 
ought to stand for co-operation, better homes, better 
schools, and a greater community spirit. In the first 
place, her position as director of children requires that 
she be a leader, and the more ability she can display 
here, the greater will be her influence upon the whole 
community.. She is at work in the only democratic, 
public-owned institution in the neighborhood, and nat- 
urally people look to her for a type of leadership not 
found in any one else. She usually comes from out- 
side the school district, and this fact would permit her 
to do many things that those living within the neighbor- 
hood could ‘not do because of strifes and jealousies. 
The teacher, then, because of her natural position as 
leader, should stand ready to do all she can for any 
worthy organization of farmers or farmers’ wives, 
because: 
(1) These organizations are usually managed by men 
and women who are the natural leaders in their respective 
communities. They are the people of the community 
who have a vision. If the teacher desires to come in 
contact with rural leaders who understand rural situa- 
tions, this is her opportunity. 
(2) In these organizations much attention is given 
to the study of economic and social questions and their 
effect on rural life. The teacher needs this information 
to fully appreciate the problems confronting the people 
with whom she works. 
(3) There are groups of people in the rural commu- 
nity who are striving toward co-operation by banding 
themselves together in these organizations. They need 
encouragement, for if there is any one virtue that needs 
to be practised in both rural and urban society to-day 
it is co-operation. 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
22 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
The teacher should do everything within her power 
to help these groups that are struggling toward higher 
ideals. The following suggested activities will assist 
the teacher in finding her place of leadership: 
(1) She can offer her personal services. 
(2) Conduct school programs for the organization. 
(3) Put up school exhibits. 
(4) Organize spelling contests as a part of the organ- 
ization program. 2 
(5) Assist the parents in caring for their children 
during programs by appointing some of the older boys 
and girls as assistants. 
(6) Attend the meetings of the organization. 
(7) If possible be an active member of the organiza- 
tion. 
The teacher, in a rural community, ought to know as 
much as possible about the organizations and individuals 
that may be active in her school district. She must be 
in a position to speak intelligently about their activities, 
teach the boys and girls about the good qualities of 
these organizations, and strive to emulate everything 
that stands for community betterment, remembering 
that the school is not the only institution striving to 
uplift rural life. 
In order that a clearer understanding may be had 
regarding these organizations, a careful study of them 
should be made. ‘The following general outline is sug- 
gested for such a study: 
(1) Origin and history. 
(2) Purposes. 
(3) Working plan of the organization. 
(4) Work that has thus far been accomplished by 
the organization.
-P-A-G-E-41
  INSTITUTIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS 23 
(5) Method and means of co-operation between this 
organization and the school. 
Since the Farm Bureau is at present one of the out- 
standing farmers’ organizations, we give the following 
information about it for careful study. It is suggested 
that other organizations be treated similarly. 
Definition J. R. Howard, the first president of the 
American Farm Bureau Federation, defines the Farm 
Bureau as follows: 
The county Farm Bureau is a voluntary organization of 
people engaged in farming, and has for its object the promotion 
of the economic and social interests of agriculture, including re- 
search and education, the farm home and the rural community. 
It is non-secret, non-partisan, and non-sectarian, and it is its 
policy as an organization not to engage in commercial activities. 
It is open to both men and women on equal terms. 
Serves as Channel.—The Farm Bureau serves as a 
channel of information from farmer to agricultural col- 
lege, and from college to farmer. Through the county 
and home-demonstration agent the Farm Bureau brings 
to the federal department of agriculture, and the agri- 
cultural college, the farmer’s view-point, and also serves 
as an agency through which the services of these great 
public institutions can be made readily available to 
the people. It serves to develop and popularize the 
best practices in agriculture and home economics. It 
is peculiarly American, and serves to point the way to 
the complete and efficient organization of our nation’s 
agriculture in promoting the welfare of the rural people 
and the public in general. The law pertaining to Farm 
Bureau organizations provides for the employment of 
special agents: county agents, home-demonstration 
agents, and junior-club agents. It is intended that 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
24 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
these employed agents shall be thoroughly trained and 
experienced. It is the duty of the agents, first, to be- 
come familiar with local conditions and to co-operate 
with the work through the local and county Farm 
Bureau organization in putting on demonstrations tend- 
ing to show better methods; second, to counsel with the 
local people in securing and applying information re- 
garding the successful experience and acquired facts 
not already generally applied in the community; and 
third, to assist in working out definite plans and a per- 
manent program. The agents are expected also to 
bring to the local people the information and services 
of extension specialists and other agencies. Informa- 
tion and the results of research and investigation are 
disseminated through these agents. The Farm Bureau 
is a special agency for the purpose of bringing to the 
entire rural population in the freest possible manner all 
of the latest information from these public sources. 
Farmer Organizations Not New in the United States. 
—Organization of the farmers is not a new idea. Thou- 
sands of agricultural associations such as farmers’ clubs, 
unions, granges, equities, gleaners, and other secret and 
non-secret fraternal associations, including also other 
co-operative associations, have rendered a very valuable 
service for many years. It is the purpose of the Farm 
Bureau to unify the efforts of these existing organiza- 
tions and to strengthen the work which they are doing. 
Origin and History.—Began in South.—The so-called 
county-agent work in the United States had its origin 
in an effort to prevent the threatened destruction of 
the cotton industry in the South by the boll-weevil. 
The first federal demonstraticn agents were appointed 
in the State of Texas in 1904. This soon developed into
-P-A-G-E-43
INSTITUTIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS 25 
a demonstration movement throughout the whole South. 
At first these federal agents were appointed to work in 
several counties. 
Spread to Northern States.—District demonstration 
work began in the Northern States in 1909. In rg1r 
  
  
    
A FARM BUREAU PICNIC 
the first county agents were appointed in the North, the 
first one being in Broome County, New York. In the 
foilowing year a small appropriation was secured from 
Congress for developing this work in the Northern 
States. The passage of the Smith-Lever or co-opera- 
tive agricultural extension act by the United States in 
1914 made available a large appropriation for promot- 
ing extension work in agriculture and home economics 
through co-operation between the U. S. Department of
-P-A-G-E-44
26 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
Agriculture and the several States’ agricultural colleges. 
The federal Smith-Lever law has since been reinforced 
by legislative enactment supplementary thereto in each 
of the various States. 
Co-operation a Big Factor.—It became evident early 
in the development of this agricultural extension move- 
ment that the co-operation of the local people in an 
organized way was most essential to success. It was 
quickly demonstrated that public funds could be used 
more economically and certainly more effectively where 
the spirit of co-operation had been developed and where 
organization had been perfected. 
World War Caused Rapid Growth—The declaration 
of a state of war with Germany in the spring of 1917 
presented a new emergency, and necessitated the im- 
mediate organization of agriculture for its greatest effi- 
ciency. The development of county Farm Bureaus pro- 
ceeded rapidly during the following months. They were 
organized as a war necessity for the purpose of promot- 
ing food-production campaigns, finding and distributing 
seeds and fertilizers, handling the farm-labor problem, 
utilizing the full available team and tractor power, pro- 
viding farm credit, and many other purposes. Congress 
made emergency appropriations as a part of the war 
program for the extension of this work, which was con- 
ducted through the U. S. Department of Agriculture 
and the State agricultural colleges. 
Reconstruction Period—Following the war and the 
withdrawing of emergency appropriations from the 
Federal Government, farmers everywhere took up the 
work of reorganization in recognition of the need of such 
an institution in handling the great problems of recon- 
struction. The earnestness with which the farmers
-P-A-G-E-45
INSTITUTIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS 27 
everywhere took hold of the movement is manifested 
at the present time by the existence of county farm 
bureaus everywhere, and the formation of State and 
nation-wide federations. 
Purposes.—The Farm Bureau is an association of 
people interested in rural affairs, which has for its pur- 
pose the development of a more economic agriculture, 
the establishment of community ideals, and the further- 
ance of all efforts of the people, the State, and the gov- 
ernment for the well-being, prosperity, and happiness 
of country people. 
The purpose of the Farm Bureau is to assist in making 
the farm business more profitable, the farm home more 
comfortable and attractive, and the community a better 
place in which to live. It seeks to perform in an organ- 
ized way certain essential activities which cannot be 
accomplished through individual effort. 
The primary purposes of the Farm Bureau are set out 
by L. R. Simons, Circular No. 13, U. S. Bureau of Agri- 
culture, as follows: 
(1) To encourage self-help through developing and ex- 
ercising leadership in the rural affairs of each community. 
(2) To reveal to all the people of the county the agri- 
cultural possibilities of the county, and how they may 
be realized. 
(3) To furnish the means whereby the agricultural 
problems of the county and the problems of the farm 
home may be systematically studied and their solution at- 
tempted through a county program of work to secure the 
well-being, prosperity, and happiness of all rural people. 
(4) To co-ordinate the efforts of existing rural agri- 
cultural forces, organized or unorganized, and to pro- 
mote new lines of effort. 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
28 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
(5) To bring to agents representing the organization, 
the State Agricultural College, and the Federal Depart- 
ment of Agriculture, the counsel and advice of the best 
people in the county as to what ought to be done and 
how to do it. 
(6) To furnish the necessary local machinery for 
easily and quickly supplying every community in the 
county with information of value to that community, 
or to the county as a whole. 
Working Plan of the Organization.—Membership.— 
The Farm Bureau organization is based, first of all, 
upon a representative membership well distributed 
throughout the county. Membership, as a rule, is open 
to any citizen of the county or any non-resident owning 
land in the county, subject to the paymentof the neces- 
sary dues and compliance with the articles of incorpora- 
tion and by-laws. It is purposed that this membership 
shall be composed mainly of farmers and farm-owners. 
Officers of County and District—The Farm Bureau 
organization provides for a director in each community 
or township, in addition to the four regular county offi- 
cers, president, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer. 
These officers and directors are elected annually by 
the Farm Bureau members. In order to strengthen the 
county organization and to meet the needs of the indi- 
vidual communities or townships, it has been customary 
to perfect community or township organizations as a 
part of the county unit. The community committee 
is made up of a chairman and from one to five other 
members. Each member is selected because of his 
special fitness as leader of a project. This leader then 
becomes responsible for his project, such as a dairy. 
poultry, or beef, and supervises its activities.
-P-A-G-E-47
  INSTITUTIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS 29 
A Definite Program.—By the above plan the Farm 
Bureau affords a direct channel through which each 
county, community, and individual farm can be reached. 
It is purposed that the various township organizations 
and the county Farm Bureau board of directors shall 
determine each year a definite program of work. This 
depends on local needs and conditions, such as local 
leadership, finances, employed help, and the assistance 
available from outside agencies. To illustrate: A town- 
ship is divided into as many «districts as there are Farm 
Bureau centers. Each district plans a meeting for the 
purpose of selecting the topics that they would like to 
have discussed for the coming winter. Suppose now 
that a township has had three such meetings, and they 
decide in No. 1 that Poultry is the topic, No. 2 Dairy 
Farming, and in No. 3 Hog-Raising. These desires are 
reported to the county Farm Bureau board, who in 
turn report to the county agent. After the entire 
county has completed such district meetings, then the 
county agent is ready to make out his year’s program, 
calling in the talent he needs from national or State 
sources. 
Resuits—The results accomplished in relation to the 
control of the cotton boll-weevil, the notable progress 
of boys’ and girls’ club work, and the development of 
community spirit have perhaps been the outstanding 
achievements of the Farm Bureau in the Southern 
States. In the Northern and Western States many 
different lines of work have been taken up. Informa- 
tion and data from the U. S. Department of Agricul- 
ture and the various agricultural colleges have been 
more effectively disseminated than ever before, likewise 
improved types of seed and live stock have been given
-P-A-G-E-48
30 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
wide distribution through the Farm Bureau organiza- 
tion. 
The welding together of more than a million farmers 
in 1,507 Farm Bureau organizations and 46 State Farm 
Bureau federations has meant a great deal to the agri- 
cultural interests of the United States. Helping to se- 
cure legislation that gave agriculture in the United States 
greater marketing facilities and farm-loan banks must 
be accredited to the Farm Bureau activities. Other 
results of co-operation of ne less importance in the many 
lines of the farming enterprise include work with crops, 
soils, live-stock, dairying, agricultural engineering, poul- 
try, and bees. 
Food Wins War.—During the war it was universally 
recognized that the efficient organization of all agricul- 
tural interests was essential. The slogan adopted was 
“Food Will Win the War.” Millions of men in all 
countries had turned from the field of agriculture to the 
field of war, yet it was essential that the production of 
food should not only be maintained but actually in- 
creased. The Farm Bureaus everywhere took hold of 
the problems of seed distribution; they boosted produc- 
tion in every line in order that the necessary food might 
be provided. It has been said that in not one single 
war measure did the farmers fail to go over the top in 
an organized way. 
Immediately following the war the problems of recon- 
struction fell upon agriculture with unabated force. 
Federal appropriations were withdrawn in a very great 
measure, and it was necessary for the Farm Bureaus 
to depend very largely upon their own local resources. 
County Farm Bureaus were reorganized, State federa- 
tions were formed, and finally the American Farm 
Bureau Federation was perfected.

INSTITUTIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS 31 
The Farm Bureau reaches out into every State and 
every agricultural county in the United States. It 
reaches out to the individual farmer and to the entire 
family living on the farm. In many States the Farm 
Bureau work came into existence at the time when the 
hog-cholera epidemic was at its height. The co-opera- 
tion of the farmers and other agencies for the purpose 
of controlling the spread of this much-dreaded con- 
tagion and the many demonstrations conducted in the 
use of antihog-cholera serum resulted in an inestimable 
saving. This work was followed up for several years, 
and has had a very permanent value. 
The Farm Bureau and the Country School.—The 
Farm Bureau has recognized from the beginning the 
importance of education. The schools likewise have 
recognized this need. The underlying purpose of the 
Farm Bureau in this movement has been to afford every 
boy and girl preparing for the business of farming at 
least the same advantages as are provided for those 
preparing for other lines of work. Every year many 
young men.and women are starting out in the world 
farming for themselves. It is the purpose of the Farm 
Bureau to give them every possible assistance and co- 
operation. 
It is the purpose of the Farm Bureau to co-operate 
with the schools in behalf of the many boys and girls 
who are regularly enrolled, and it is likewise their pur- 
pose to give the same attention to adults and to those 
who are not enrolled in regular classes. This is done 
through short courses and community meetings of many 
kinds. The country school building becomes the natural 
center of the community and the teacher the natural 
leader; therefore Farm Bureau leaders expect a very

close co-operation between their organization and the 
school. 
QUESTIONS FOR STUDY OF FARM ORGANIZATIONS 
In case a more detailed study of farm organizations is desired, 
the following questions are suggested. Each organization may 
be clearly studied through the series of questions. If answered 
to the student’s satisfaction he will have a better knowledge 
and can arrive at definite conclusions. 
1. Does the organization stand for better schools and educa- 
tion in general ? 
. Does the organization stand for social uplift? 
Does it have a complete and effective organization? 
Does it include women in its membership? 
Does the organization stand for financial gain? 
Does it interest itself in scientific agriculture? 
Does the organization stand for recreation? 
Does the organization have membership dues? 
Does it stand for co-operation ? 
What influence has it had upon the people? SEI AMEE D W

Section I]. Tur Rurat Home 
Rural life and institutions cannot be discussed with- 
out including the home, for it is the view of all inter- 
ested in life and society that of all institutions the family 
is the most important. It is the institution dedicated 
by society to the reproduction of human beings, both 
biologically and socially. 
The country home, like any home, is the place where 
ideas, ideals, customs, and habits are impressed. The 
farm home is really all the farm; the buildings, trees, 
garden, the house in which the family lives, and the 
family itself. The average city home, with all of its 
varied interests and complexities, becomes a_ resort

chiefly for smaller children, and a hotel, or filling station, 
for the older members of the family. 
The farm home becomes a strong and _ influential 
agency for country-life progress; the child’s first knowl-

edge of work: comes from this source. His idea of co- 
operation both in work and play is fostered here. 
The Rural Teacher and the Home.—Cince the school, 
home, and church are foundational, certainly the work- 
ers in these institutions must have duties in common. 
What interests the parents concerning their children 
ought to be of interest to the teacher. The teacher 
and home must co-operate if both would accomplish 
the best results. 
   
-P-A-G-E-52
  34 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
Rural teachers sometimes fail. One of the causes of 
failure is lack of acquaintance, lack of personal contact, 
with the home that is so necessary to success in the 
teaching profession. Well-meaning people will often 
criticise the teacher because they do not understand 
her motives. A mother who ten years ago was a 
teacher, and taught the abc method, now lives in 
the country and sends her child to school to an excellent 
teacher, who teaches reading by the phonetic, word, or 
sentence method. She should be the most valued ally 
of the teacher, but between them arises a reserve that 
prevents the best results. This is a clear case of not 
understanding each other. Many, many cases of this 
kind could be mentioned, where the parents stand as 
it were on one side of this mysterious gulf and criticise 
the teacher, while on the other side stands the teacher 
criticising the parents. If the teachers in our rural 
and small-town schools want to do all in their power to 
make themselves successful, let them, during the first 
month of their school, make definite plans for visiting 
the homes of all the children in their school. 
Many questions confront the young inexperienced 
teacher regarding the matter of visiting the homes such 
as the following: A 
Should a teacher go into a home without being invited ? 
The teacher needs to go into the home just as much 
as the pastor. She should know the homes of her chil- 
dren. She should not wait until she is invited or she 
might never go to some homes. Most homes will 
gladly welcome a visit from the teacher, because par- 
ents are usually interested in the welfare of their chil- 
dren. Many parents have not been accustomed to 
teachers visiting in their homes, and quite often when
-P-A-G-E-53
  
INSTITUTIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS 35 
visits are made, it is because Johnnie has been bad and 
the teacher is driven to this means as a last resort to 
secure peace and order. Teachers should make home 
visitation a definite part of their teaching program 
without any thought of waiting until an invitation has 
been sent from individual homes. 
Another question of importance that must be an- 
swered: 
What will the teacher attempt to do when in the 
home? 
The teacher must remember that her visit is perhaps 
to bridge gulfs and chasms of misunderstandings, and 
she must get acquainted. She cannot do this by assum- 
ing the atmosphere of a fashionable caller, leaving her 
calling-card on a silver platter in the hall, asking and 
answering a few questions about the weather. No, 
rather she must in the bést form possible interest her- 
self, without flattery, and seeming wonderment, in the 
interests of the farmer, the farmer’s wife, and especially 
in the pets, or interests, of the children. When supper 
is over she ought not to sit in the parlor while the 
mother washes the dishes; rather she should go to the 
kitchen to help dry the dishes and make herself con- 
genial. 
What should she learn while in the home? 
The teacher will discover the environment of the 
children in the home, their likes and dislikes. She will 
learn in what kind of music the family is interested and 
the books, papers, and magazines that the family reads. 
The amusements and recreation indulged in by the 
family and the conveniences about the home will be 
evident. The attitude of the parents toward the chil- 
dren, and the attitude of children toward the parents, 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  36 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
and the apparent relation of the family to the church 
and Sunday-school will be discovered. All these and 
no doubt many other minor influences will be discovered 
by the visiting teacher. 
The following suggested questions will assist the vis- 
iting teacher in determining the environment of the 
children: 
1. What do they have to read? 
2. What musical instruments do they have, and what 
type of music do they play? 
3. Does the family have any time for recreation? 
If they do, what type of recreation do they enjoy? 
Are vacations planned for the family? 
Do they have games in the home? What kind? 
. Do the children have half-holidays? 
What kind and amount of work must they do? 
‘9. What partnership do parents have with their 
children ? 
10. Do parents enjoy recreation and companionship 
with the children? : 
ir. Do parents grant a weekly allowance to each 
child? 
12. Do parents interest themselves in boys’ and girls’ 
clubs ? 
What she finds is not for any other purpose than to 
make her a more conscientious and sympathetic teacher. 
What a medium for gossip spores if she were foolish 
enough to tell all she found out. 
Again the question of the length of time a teacher 
should remain in the home and how often she should 
visit must be answered. 
This home visitation cannot be done in the same way 
that one might make five or six fashionable calls in an ea an
-P-A-G-E-55
  
  INSTITUTIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS 37 
afternoon. This visit, as has been indicated above, is 
for getting acquainted, and that usually can be done 
better by being with the family during at least one 
meal. In many rural homes it becomes very convenient 
for the teacher to stay overnight, and this gives further 
opportunity for knowing the family and farm-home 
conditions. It would seem best then to suggest that 
to try to be in the home for at least one meal, and per- 
haps to stay overnight, would, in most cases, be enough 
time to get acquainted. If the teacher really comes to 
know the home during a period of visitation as indicated 
above, she will not need to again visit this home over 
as long a period, but can keep up her acquaintance by 
short calls and visits as opportunities may present. 
The Physical Conditions in Rural Homes.—The physi- 
cal conditions in rural homes have changed greatly 
during the past twenty years, as is shown in Chapter I. 
However, the student of rural life must realize that not 
all rural homes have made such wonderful progress, 
and that usually there is a very close relation between 
physical conditions and ideals. In order that a brief 
study may be made, rural homes have been divided into 
three classes: ideal, average, and inferior. 
Ideal Home.—Ideal country homes are very much 
more common now than a few years ago.: However, 
*the ideal home, as far as the physical side is concerned, 
will not save the country, but, other things being equal, 
the ideal homes stand for high ideals. 
This ideal farm home has all the conveniences of the 
finest city home: labor-saving devices, sleeping-porches, 
linen-closets, basement under entire house, dumb- 
waiter, built-in refrigerator, running water, electric 
light and power, bathroom, office library, laundry-room,
-P-A-G-E-56
  38 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
vegetable-room, large living-room, well-equipped kitchen, 
heated garage in connection with the home, steam or 
hot-water heat, well-finished attic, clothes-chute, and 
many other little additions that make the physical side 
of the home complete. This home has been planned 
with the greatest care. It is convenient, well-propor- 
tioned, and has been built according to the best scientific 
principles. The exterior corresponds with the surround- 
ings. In every detail art and beauty have joined with 
practical usefulness to produce a beautiful home. 
Average Home.—There are more average people in 
the world than any other type. This is true regarding 
homes in the Middle Western States, as is shown by 
several recent surveys. This average home may be the 
old homestead that has undergone many changes since 
falling into the hands of young people of a new genera- 
tion. The house has been rearranged and semimodern- 
ized. The old cellar has been dug out, the entire house 
raised and placed upon a higher wall, giving more base- 
ment room. Spacious front and back porches are 
built. Water is piped for kitchen use, A well-built 
cesspool receives all waste water from the kitchen-sink, 
the kitchen lavatory, and the wash water from the 
laundry-tubs in the basement. Electricity has been 
brought in from a power line that passes the farm, and 
power has been applied to washing and churning. A. 
pipeless furnace has been added. The kitchen has been 
remodelled so as to make the housework easier. Every- 
thing possible has been done to improve the conditions 
without building a new house. 
The average home may not have all of these con- 
veniences—it may have more—but the average farm 
home stands as a living example of what the farmer thinks
-P-A-G-E-57
  INSTITUTIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS 39 
when he is planning for larger and better things for his 
family. 
Inferior Home.—The inferior rural home is rapidly 
passing. It usually shelters a family that has been un- 
fortunate or one that does not have the higher ideals. 
This home can be distinguished from the other type 
at a glance; the dooryard is usually an index of the in- 
terior. There are no conveniences in house or barn, no 
labor devices, no comforts, simply four walls in which 
are found a few rooms (three or four on an average), 
with nothing in them to make for a real home. 
The physical side of a home is very important. How- 
ever, fine buildings, labor-saving devices, fine furniture 
and all the appointments that can be added, do not 
make the home. The home is the sum total of those 
elements and experiences that leave their impression 
upon the very life and character of those who compose 
the family. 
The following is given here because of the many excel- 
lent suggestions regarding the physical side of rural 
homes: 
Wuat A Farm RESWENCE SHOULD BE 
The possibilities of farmhouse architecture are well 
given in the following quotation from an address by 
Dean L. H. Baily, given before the students of Cornell 
Agricultural College in 1910: 
(1) The farm residence should fit the farm country. The 
house should be broad and low rather than narrow and tall. 
We need a type of farm architecture that seems to grow out of 
farming conditions. That is, the structure must look like a 
farmhouse rather than like a town house. 
(2) The house should be very simple in its general plan and 
construction. This is true of all houses, but particularly of 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
40 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
country houses. The farmhouse should be condensed, whether 
it is large or small. The beauty of a building lies not in its ex- 
ternal ornamentation, but in its proportions, its fitness to con- 
ditions, and in the materials of which it is constructed. 
(3) The ordinary farmhouse should have a very simple roof 
scheme, with as few valleys and peaks and flashings as possible. 
The beauty of the house should lie in its dignified and simple 
skylines rather than in its complex and broken features. 
(4) The house should be planned to save steps to the utmost. 
The kitchen, dining-room, wood-shed, and cellar should all be 
within easy reach of one another. So far as possible, the rooms 
that are daily used together or between which there is very 
much travel, particularly on the part of the housewife, should 
be on the same floor, with no steps up and down. We should 
so plan a house that the woman may be able to save much of 
her energy for other activities than merely those of housekeeping. 
(5) The house should be so planned and made that it can be 
easily cleaned. This means an absence of all elaborate spindle 
work, filigree, and also of heavy and upholstered hangings in 
the furnishings. Now that we are appreciating the relation of 
dust to health, we must take a new attitude toward the con- 
struction and the furnishing of residences. 
(6) The house should be constructed or remodelled with the 
idea of applying power to some of the household work, as to the 
laundry, pumping, eventually to the cleaning of the rooms, and 
to other labor. We have been applying power to the work*of 
the farm and the barn, but we have not adapted it to any great 
extent to the work of the house itself. 
(7) Every modern house should have water running into it 
and out of it. Within twenty-five years every good farm resi- 
dence, and even many tenant houses, will be as well provided 
with water-supply facilities as are city homes. 
(8) The ordinary farmhouse must be planned in such a way 
that the members of the family can do the housework. In many 
cases it is possible to reduce the work of keeping house by at 
least one-quarter or even one-third, if the house plan is carefully 
studied with this idea in mind. 
(9) You all know that most of the unexpected visitors to a 
farmhouse go to the back door or side door. This means that 
the back of the house is to be as highly developed in some re-
-P-A-G-E-59
  
  INSTITUTIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS 41 
spects as the front. Perhaps it will mean in the end that there 
really is no ‘‘back”’ to the house at all, and that the establish- 
ment shall ‘“‘face’’ all ways and have no unkempt back yard. 
(to) The house must be provided with ample storage space. 
Groceries are often bought in quantity. The winter’s supplies 
are “put down” in the cellar. Ordinarily, the larger part of 
this storage is in the cellar or the attic. This necessitates many 
steps. It is a question whether a good deal of this material 
would not better be stored on the first floor, with a place spe- 
cially designed for it, like an enlarged closet. 
(11) The first floor and the cellar are the centers of the family 
activity. The members of the family spend much of their time 
out-of-doors. This means that the first floor should not be ap- 
proached by high steps from the outside, and also that wash- 
rooms and other service rooms should be on this floor and easy 
of access, and preferably near the farmside entrance. 
(12) When additions are placed on an old house, care should 
be taken to have them match the style of the original. If left 
to the whim of the ordinary carpenter, additions to residences 
are not likely to present a suitable appearance. 
The following abstract from an address made by 
Director L. H. Baily to the students of Cornell College 
in 1913, three years later, explains in an excellent man- 
ner the changes that are rapidly coming into the archi- 
tecture of farm homes. 
THE Farm PLAN AND THE House PLAN 
On the side of the individual farmer, the process of redirecting 
his whole farm scheme is now well under way. By means of 
direction, aid, and sympathy, a new farm plan will work out in 
cases where it is needed, although it will still take considerable 
time. 
Farming is a business system and, like other business systems, 
it must have a center. The center of the farm business is the 
residence. When we strike the farmhouse we strike the very 
center of rural life. It is just as much a problem to reorganize 
the farmhouse as it is to reorganize the farm itself. 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
42 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
Most of our farmhouses were built many years ago. The 
older ones were adapted to a former kind of country life and to 
a type of farming that is gradually changing. Not a few houses 
are gradually falling into disuse. Some homes are all that can 
be desired; but the larger part of the establishments in New 
York State must be either thoroughly remodelled or else rebuilt 
within the next forty years. It is very important, therefore, that 
we do not follow old lines of house planning and construction. 
Of course, we do not mean that the farmer is to discard his 
residence before such time as he desires to do so, and certainly 
not before he feels that his income warrants him to make a 
change. My point is that as fast as the farmhouses are rebuilt 
or reconstructed, certain new features must be incorporated into 
them. Neither do we mean that the farmer must build expen- 
sively. A cheap house may serve its purpose in the class of 
construction to which it belongs, and it is as easy to make it 
convenient as to make it inconvenient. 
The farm scheme has been largely traditional, fields being 
added as the forests have been cleared; and these fields tend to 
remain year after year. A modern farm management obliter- 
ates all unnecessary limits and lines and makes a new plan of 
the whole property. Similarly, the farmhouse has been very 
largely traditional in its plan and construction. A familiar type 
of house is the long upright-and-wing, with the kitchen at one 
end and the living-rooms at the farther end, and with perhaps 
the cellar under the upright, or parlor, necessitating much travel. 
Only a part of the house was warmed, so that the living was 
nearly all concentrated in the kitchen and in one or two rooms 
adjoining it. Any rambling type lacks the concentration that 
is needed in middle-class new houses of the present day. 
The introduction of water systems, the difficulty of obtaining 
household help, the expense of heating, the removal of the 
handling of milk from the residence in many cases, and many 
other changes, have made a new design of farmhouse quite as 
essential as a new plan of the farm itself. 
Section III. Tue Rurat CHurcH 
The term rural church, as discussed here, refers to 
all denominations, sects, and sections, Protestant and
-P-A-G-E-61
INSTITUTIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS 43, 
Catholic, orthodox and liberal, in towns of 2,500 and 
less as well as in the open country. 
In America there can be no permanently sound, 
vigorous national life unless life in the country is vigor- 
ous and sound. Country life cannot be morally strong, 
physically healthy, and socially attractive unless the 
church functions properly. ae country church is one 
of the great roots of civilization. It stands with the 
home and the school to form the very foundation of our 
nation. The church has properly held the position as 
the dictator of religious thought, the director of social 
events, and the sponsor for the best ideals in a com- 
munity. This institution has for ages functioned satis- 
factorily in this important work, and must be upheld 
by the thinking people of our commonwealth or the 
nation must pay the penalty. 
God’s great purpose for men is the highest possible 
development of each personality and of the human race 
asa whole. It is essential to this growth that men shall 
hold adequate ideals of character and life. The Chris- 
tian believes that these ideals must spring from a clear 
appreciation of God’s purpose, and from a consuming 
desire to reproduce the spirit and life of Jesus. There- 
fore, the function of the country church is to create, 
to maintain, and to enlarge both individual and com- 
munity ideals, under the inspiration and guidance of 
the Christian motive and teaching, and to help rural 
people to incarnate these ideals in personal and family 
life, in industrial effort, in political development, and 
in all social relationships. 
Many rural churches do not plan a live program. 
They take into consideration the traditional duties of 
the church—services twice on Sunday and _prayer-  
-P-A-G-E-62

meeting on Wednesday evening with an occasional 
Ladies’ Aid supper to help pay for a new rug to be used 
in the parsonage. The present-day church must have 
a program that not only cares for the religious growth 
and training of its members but for the social life as well. 
The rural church must also stand ready to lead in as 
  A MODERN RURAL CHURCH 
many legitimate activities as possible, and at all times 
place Christian leadership in charge. The church 
building ought to be used more than six hours a week. 
What firm or enterprise that really means to carry on 
any line of business in earnest would be satisfied to 
keep its doors open only six hours a week? The business 
man would look upon such an investment of $150,000 to 
$500,000 as bringing in very poor interest returns. And 
yet hundreds of churches do nothing to lead young peo-
-P-A-G-E-63
INSTITUTIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS 45 
ple, children, and the middle-aged in their midweek social 
life. The rural church is missing a wonderful opportunity, 
and as a result many other institutions—some of them 
questionable—have come in to entertain the people. 
There are many channels through which the church 
may serve the community. The country church should 
foster private and public worship of God. Its preach- 
ing should bring a ringing spiritual message to the com- 
munity, and interpret the gospel for the uplift of motive 
and the transformation and development of character. 
Kenyon L. Butterfield holds the problem of the rural 
church as the most important aspect of the rural prob- 
lem. It touches the highest point in the redirection of 
rural life. It sounds the deepest note in the harmo- 
nizing of the factors of a permanent rural civilization. 
It speaks the most eloquent word in the struggle to 
maintain the status of the farming class. Can the 
church rise to its opportunities? 
Below is a suggested program of service for a rural 
church. A part of this program well worked out would 
revolutionize any rural community. 
(1) Preaching every Sunday. 
(2) Singing by the congregation. 
(3) Studying topics with rural setting. 
(4) Grading Bible instruction for children. 
(5) Studying the Bible. 
(6) Organizing clubs within the church for community service 
projects; bringing outside speakers at club dinners, etc., 
to discuss community work. 
(7) Utilizing existing women’s organizations for larger and 
more effective service. 
(8) Giving public advocacy to various forms of social service, 
such as clean-up days, community picnics, play festivals, 
town improvement, Arbor Day, beautifying cemeteries or 
parks. 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
46 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
(9) Preaching contentment with rural life and adequacy of 
country as a life investment. 
(to) Making church sociables community affairs. 
(11) Instigating and aiding community co-operation for such 
ends as the following: 
(a) Public health and sanitation. 
(6) Good roads. 
(c) School education for rural life, and consolidated 
schools. 
(d) Provisions for public recreation, and a Saturday 
half-holiday for agricultural laborers. 
(e) Beauty of village, roadsides, and private grounds. 
(12) Furnishing leaders for special community tasks. 
(z3) Special work with boys and girls. 
(14) Meeting of official boards and organizations regularly and 
completely organized with proper program of work. 
(15) Keeping records and regular reports of work in finances. 
(16) Training in young people’s meetings. 
Attitude of the Teacher Toward the Church.—In former 
discussions it has been shown that the church, home, 
and school are co-operating institutions. Each institu- 
tion is vitally interested in the stand taken by the other. 
. Since the teacher is the active agent of the com- 
munity in one of these institutions, she at once becomes 
a co-worker with the pastor and the parents in further- 
ing the ideals of the community. The teacher may 
argue that she did not or does not intend to help run 
the church. The contract does not call for this ac- 
tivity, but there are many duties falling upon the teacher 
that will never appear in the contract. The teacher 
who deserves the name leader will not stop to consider 
the contract alone; she will go the second mile and not 
ask the reason why. She realizes that her example 
counts for much, especially with the children of her 
school. She knows that by placing herself in the posi-  
-P-A-G-E-65
  INSTITUTIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS 47 
tion of one who believes in moral and religious teaching, 
she is upholding the best ideals of the nation and at the 
same time assisting its basic institutions. 
There are several ways in which the teacher may 
help carry on a vital program in the church. 
(1) Every teacher ought to attend her own church. 
If the church of her choice is not at hand, she should 
select one that answers as nearly as possible and attend 
that church regularly. The teacher’s presence in the 
church at the appointed time of worship indicates where 
she stands in this very important matter. 
(2) The teacher of ability ought to help in one of the 
allied church organizations. A teacher who really de- 
serves the name will not necessarily rush home every 
week-end in order to get away from the small community, 
but she will remain in her district to get better ac- 
quainted, to lead young people’s meetings, or to teach 
a Sunday-school class. 
(3) A teacher should study the problems of the rural 
church and keep in touch with the outside allied forces. 
The church needs trained leaders. Especially is this 
true in the Sunday school. The church schools have 
not been organized in an efficient manner; any one inter- 
ested in teaching the Bible has been allowed to take a 
class of children and make an attempt at teaching 
without even high-school training. The Sunday school 
needs trained teachers just as much as the day school, 
and a teacher in a community can be of great service 
if she will use her pedagogical training for the advance- 
ment of the Sunday school. Since she is, by the very 
nature of the situation, a co-worker it will be her duty 
not only to study the immediate problems but also to 
be a student of the church at large.

CHAPTER IIT 
THE COMMUNITY CENTER 
A community center is a group of people met together 
for the purpose of social, educational, or recreational 
uplift. This community may be an ordinary school 
district of four sections, including all the families, not 
simply a ‘‘chosen few,” as is so often the case, but all 
who live within the borders of the territory covered; 
or it may be a consolidated school district with ALL of 
its patrons included. The aim is to secure the co- 
operation and interest of all those who live within a 
natural area of communication, so that the community 
members may all come together, not occasionally but 
frequently, to discuss their common interests and enjoy 
themselves as one big family. The community center 
may be organized with a president, secretary and 
treasurer and various committees. It may also adopt 
a constitution and by-laws, but such a complex organiza- 
tion is not necessary, nor is it always advisable. 
In many,rural communities there may be other live 
organizations such as the Farm Bureau, Mothers’ Club, 
Parent-Teacher organization that are answering all the 
needs of a community or social center. In that case 
the proper attitude for the teacher to take is that of 
co-operation. It would be very unwise for a teacher to 
organize any activity that did not really have a place 
in the community and which did not meet with the 
hearty support of the majority of the school patrons.

  THE COMMUNITY CENTER 53 
Object.—Rural surveys reveal that patrons do not 
visit their schools. Renters sometimes are uninterested. 
Landowners do not care to see school improvements. 
Recreation and sociability are lacking. Rural people do 
not discuss their own problems in community gather- 
ings. Therefore the community center is organized to 
bring parents, patrons, and all concerned into closer 
touch with the school, and to bring the people of the 
community together in their agricultural, social, edu- 
cational, and recreational thinking. 
Growth of Movement.—The movement to use the 
school plant for community purposes is gaining ground 
rapidly in many parts of the United States, both in 
urban and rural districts. The community center 
meeting is of particular value in rural districts in help- 
ing to counteract the natural tendency of farm life 
toward isolation. 
Beginning with a community center organization in 
one rural district, eight years ago, the members of the 
tural department of the Iowa State Teachers’ College 
have watched the spread of the community-center idea 
into all of the demonstration schools associated with the 
college during that time. Two of these schools are of 
the nature of village schools, three are consolidated 
schools, and the remaining number are typical rural 
schools. A careful study of the results obtained leads 
to the conclusion that the community-center meeting 
may be made a very helpful factor in building up the 
school and the community which it serves. 
Leadership Required.—Every teacher interested in 
tne upbuilding of the school covets the power of leader- 
ship in the community. Leadership may be defined as 
the ability to get others to do what the leader thinks
-P-A-G-E-72
54 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
should be done. Napoleon had the power of leadership 
to such a remarkable degree that, had he been beset 
by a band of robbers, he, no doubt, would have im- 
mediately taken command of the band and marched 
them off to suit his own purposes. The successful 
community leader, unlike the military leader of Na- 
poleon’s day, keeps himself in the background as much 
as possible and stimulates others in the community 
into active participation that they may share more 
largely in the benefits of that activity. 
The Teacher an Important Factor in a Community 
Organization —Usually it devolves upon the teacher to 
take the initiative in developing a community-center 
organization. The most effective way to begin to get 
acquainted is to explain something of the purpose and 
plans of the proposed community-center organization 
and invite the people of the community to gather at 
the schoolhouse on a given date to attend a program. 
People of proper influence should be taken into the 
teacher’s confidence and the purpose and plan thoroughly 
explained to them. These people should be invited to 
attend and assist in giving inspiration and enthusiasm 
for such meetings. It is very important that the teacher 
understands the people of her community before at- 
tempting any form of organization. 
Seven Closely Related Groups.—The community- 
center meeting makes it possible to bring together, at 
regular intervals, the different groups of people who are, 
in one way or another, connected with the school, and 
upon whose co-operation the larger success of the school 
depends. These personal factors are: (1) The teacher. 
(2) The pupils. (3) The parents.. (4) The school 
board. (5) The taxpayer. (6) The young people of
-P-A-G-E-73
  THE COMMUNITY CENTER 55 
the community. (7) The county superintendent of 
schools. 
The parents, when their attention is called to the — 
matter, put no other interest above the education of their 
children. The members of the school board may be 
very much interested in the successful progress of the 
school, or they may be so busy with their own personal 
affairs that the condition of the school escapes their 
notice. The taxpayers of the community who have no 
children in the school have their attention called to the 
school chiefly because of their being touched by the 
school in that most tender spot, the pocket-book. The 
young people of the community often find that the ties 
are severed which once bound them to the school and 
interested them in its progress. The county superin- 
tendent welcomes opportunities to meet with the people 
in the interests of better schools. 
Rural Survey and Its Results.—A rural life survey, 
made in the districts of the demonstration schools asso- 
ciated with the Iowa State Teachers’ College, discloses 
several tendencies that the community-center meetings 
counteract: (rt) In reply to the inquiry, ‘‘How often do 
you visit the school?” the answer in about 80 per cent 
of the cases was: ‘‘We aim to visit the school at least 
once a year, but we didn’t get there this year.” It is 
noticeable that the new interest in the school gained 
through visiting it for community-center meetings is 
carried over into visits to the school while it is in regular 
session. (2) In many districts only a few farmers in 
the four square miles of territory which comprise the 
school district send any children to the school. A large 
proportion of the farmers in the district, having no 
children to send to the rural school, have no direct con-
-P-A-G-E-74
56 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
nection with it or interest in its progress except as tax- 
payers. The community-center meetings gather these 
families together in the schoolhouse to see the work of 
the school, to note its progress, to hear its needs dis- 
cussed, and to find in it a center for the improvement of 
community life. (3) In a number of school districts, 
more than one-half of the acreage is farmed by renters. 
Often the children of tenant farmers comprise more than 
one half of the school. The first of March finds many 
of these families moving into new districts. The com- 
munity-center meetings furnish an excellent opportunity 
for the new-comers in the district to get acquainted 
with their neighbors and to get into sympathy with the 
ideals and plans of the community. (4) There are 
many patrons of the demonstration schools who were 
born in foreign countries. In one district the fathers 
and mothers of all the children in the school were born 
in the Old World, and none of them had attended 
American schools. The community-center meetings 
offer these parents an excellent opportunity to get into 
touch with the spirit and ideals of American public 
schools. (5) Most of the farm homes in these districts 
are well supplied with daily papers and periodicals. A 
number of farmers reported that they took as many as 
twenty publications. Many said, however, that they 
did not read their farm papers very carefully. The 
debates and discussions in the community-center meet- 
ings on important rural life problems lead to a much more 
careful reading of these publications. (6) On many 
farms there were the most modern labor-saving ma- 
chinery—the most modern farm buildings, such as 
sanitary dairy barns, silos, improved hog-houses, and 
power elevators in the corn-cribs; but on very few farms  
-P-A-G-E-75
THE COMMUNITY CENTER by 
were there modern houses equipped with modern labor- 
saving machinery and devices for the women. Dis- 
cussions in community-center meetings of the modern 
farm home help to call attention to this discrimination 
against the farm women. (7) In several communities 
the answer to the question, ‘‘What do the young people 
do for recreation?” was: “They go to town nights.” 
The community-center meeting provides a common 
meeting-place in the district which helps to meet the 
social needs of the young people. The supper, social 
hour, and games after the program are the most im- 
portant in the community-center movement. 
Thinking and Acting —It is a law of human nature 
that the things we see and hear, we think and talk 
about. The things we think and talk about, we finally 
come to do, if we think and talk about them long enough. 
The teacher who can bring parents, school board, tax- 
payers, and young people together to see the work of the 
school and the condition of the building and equip- 
ment, and to hear the progress and needs of the school 
discussed, will send the parents, school board, taxpayers, 
and young people home to think about and discuss these 
things the next day. Out of this thinking and discus- 
sion will come actual assistance in building up the school 
along the lines in which there is evident need for prog- 
ress. The co-operation of all is secured in a common 
purpose. : 
Helpful Folks in Every Community.—There exists 
among members of every rural community a remarka- 
ble amount of knowledge of the best things in education, 
in crop-raising, in animal husbandry, in modern home- 
making, in road-building, in religious training, in civic 
improvement, and in social affairs. There are also vast
-P-A-G-E-76
58 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
latent enthusiasms and potential powers. The members 
of every community know better than the community 
does. The purpose of the community-center meeting is 
to bring the members of the community into cl6se and 
active contact with each other, to disseminate through 
the community the best knowledge that its members 
possess, and to quicken the latent enthusiasm and energy 
into action. 
Community Center a Clearing-House.—‘‘I prize these 
meetings very highly,” said a speaker on one program, 
“because they give me an opportunity to get acquainted 
with my neighbors and with what they are doing.” It 
has been noted that a lukewarm member of a com- 
munity, who presents some topic before the community- 
center meeting, is usually converted by that act into 
an enthusiastic booster. The parent who discusses how 
to improve the school becomes a better patron himself 
as well as helping to improve the school spirit of the com- 
munity. The community-center meeting serves as a’ 
clearing-house where the best things known to the ex- 
perience of the members of the community are contrib- 
uted, to be redistributed throughout the whole com- 
munity. 
School a Common Interest.—The school is the com- 
munity’s one great common interest under the direction 
of a leader paid out of a common fund. The school- 
house is the most fitting place in which to hold commu- 
nity meetings. Many people have been in the habit of 
judging the condition and equipment of the school build- 
ing on the inside by the appearance of the grounds and 
the schoolhouse on the outside as they drive by. The 
community-center meeting held in the schoolhouse brings 
the school board, parents, and taxpayers into the build-
-P-A-G-E-77
THE COMMUNITY CENTER 59 
ing, where they may be tactfully led to see that provision 
should be made for correct lighting, heating, and ven- 
tilating of the schoolroom. Often to require an audi- 
ence to sit for an hour and a half in the school seats is 
the most eloquent plea that can be made for improved 
seating arrangements. The ceilings, walls, floors, li- 
brary, and other equipment may be made to tell their 
own needs. 
The first purpose of a community-center organization 
is to build up the school in every way in which the school 
can be made to serve the interests of the children better. 
Other community interests which may be fostered by 
community-center meetings: good roads, the use of bet- 
ter seed and varieties of farm crops, better breeds of 
farm animals, improved farm machinery, systems of 
crop rotation, cultivation of the soil, better farm: homes, 
better business organizations for buying and selling, 
power labor-saving machinery for women, community 
recreation, community sanitation, law enforcement, 
better fathers and mothers, fly-fighting campaign, civic 
responsibilities of the community, national ideals, and 
the reading of the best things in literature. Everything 
that makes for a better community makes for a better 
school, and a better school helps to make a better com- 
munity. 
When a warm personal regard grows up between the 
parents and the teacher as a result of associating to- 
gether at the community-center meetings, the develop- 
ment of an orderly, wholesome, enthusiastic school 
spirit among the children of the school is greatly facili- 
tated. 
To develop a great interest in community meetings 
and make them the source of the most good to the com-
-P-A-G-E-78
60 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
munity, they should be held at least once a month. 
Too long a period between meetings kills the interest. 
Some of the demonstration schools have developed such 
an interest that the people of the community want to 
hold their meetings oftener than once a month. 
The Program.—The programs for the community 
meetings should be so planned that the children in the 
school and people in the community take part as well 
as invited speakers from the outside. Several recita- 
tions from the regular daily schedule will prove inter- 
esting and give the parents and taxpayers some idea 
of the progress the children are making and of how 
efficiently the money of the district is being expended. 
Reading classes, especially primary reading if well 
taught, phonics, drill work in arithmetic, agriculture, 
home economics, language lessons, and school songs offer 
splendid material for such demonstrations. Be honest 
with the audience. Let them see some of the regular 
school work which has not been specially prepared for 
the program. 
The teacher might follow up these class exercises with 
a brief talk calling attention to the good things about 
the school and its equipment, then tactfully show the 
people some of the needs of the school. Do not urge 
expenditure of money beyond a very limited amount 
at the first meeting. The community-center meeting, 
like a snowball rolling down hill, gains in size and mo- 
mentum the farther it goes. Tactful suggestions will 
lead the péople to see for themselves in a little while 
what their school needs, and the thought will grow with 
repetition until the community will be ready to act. 
The machinery of the organization is not especially 
important. Some communities like to elect officers.
-P-A-G-E-79
  THE COMMUNITY CENTER 61 
Others prefer to leave the general directions of the meet- 
ings to the teacher. If the teacher can keep herself in 
the background and put some public-spirited member 
of the community into the foreground as chairman, 
this individual will take a more active interest in the 
welfare of the school and will shoulder a part of the re- 
sponsibility for the success of the meetings. The chair- 
man may be selected by a vote of the people or by ap- 
pointment by the teacher. Some communities prefer 
to have the teacher act as chairman. 
The Program as a Project.—The teacher should al- 
ways be a positive factor in planning programs and 
carrying them out as effectively as possible. The 
teacher should study the people and the conditions in 
the neighborhood carefully and try to make such use 
of them as will result in the largest improvement of the 
school and betterment of the community. 
The teacher may provide for the pupils of her school 
excellent lessons in composition and penmanship by 
asking them to write invitations to the community- 
center meeting to all the families in the neighborhood. 
Each time if possible these invitations are worded more 
cleverly, and written more neatly, than the time before. 
The pupils in the handwork class may make and properly 
decorate the envelopes. Usually, arrangements can be 
made to have the children distribute these invitations. 
The development of a project centered in a Christmas 
program is illustrated in the following summary of the 
activities of the Eddy School, one of the rural demon- 
stration schools associated with the Iowa State Teachers” 
College. The teacher began the preparations a month 
before the program was given. She endeavored to use 
all possible means of adding interest to the school work. 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  62 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
There were several minor projects to which the teacher 
needed to give attention in this particular program, and 
no doubt all of these could not be worked out in every 
school, but some of them could be used in any school to 
motivate school work and add interest to the program. 
This discussion was prepared by Miss Anna Gorman, the 
teacher, who reported as follows: 
CHRISTMAS COMMUNITY MEETING, 
EDDY SCHOOL, CHRISTMAS, 1920 
Our Pilgrim work over, we began to make preparations for 
Christmas. A meeting of the school children was called to de- 
termine the kind of program we should have. It was decided 
that as much of our work as possible, from that time on, should 
relate to Christmas and that the community should be invited 
to-enjoy the results of our endeavor. 
LaNGuaGE 
The first grade wanted to have its sand-table represent a 
Santa Claus story, while the third grade, who did not believe in 
Santa Claus, wanted a true story about Christ. They chose 
The Three Wise Men. The fifth, sixth, and seventh grades voted 
to make booklets containing an original story about “How the 
Christmas Season Breaks the Monotony of Winter.” All of 
these were to be placed on exhibition at the time of our meeting. 
Various forms of invitations were written as a class exercise 
in language. A vote was taken to select the form to be used 
later when it was time to send out our cards. 
Hanp Work 
A frieze was made for the blackboard as well as a border. 
This work was done in the seventh and first grades, following 
an approved pattern. A fireplace was needed for one of our 
plays and for one of the songs. This the sixth-grade boys offered 
to make in ‘the manual-training class. The selection of the 
Christmas tree was left with a sixth and a fifth grade boy. The 
sixth-grade girls had charge of decorating it; they were assisted, 
however, by the ‘first grade. For instance, one of our songs
-P-A-G-E-81
THE COMMUNITY CENTER 63 
called for ‘‘Popcorn as Snow” on the tree. The sixth-grade 
girls popped the corn in our kitchen, then turned it over to the 
first grade to string. 
Another verse of the song called for stockings at the fireplace. 
The third-grade girls cut free-hand patterns and made ,the 
stockings from black construction paper. (Patterns were cut 
for the frieze in the same manner.) The seventh-grade girls cut 
the patterns and gave them to the first grade to color. They 
used water-colors. One child in the class, who was very careful 
about the appearance of the work, took charge and directed all 
the others. 
For the programme, every member made his own costume. 
The fairy, who was a first-grade girl, made her cap, wings, and 
wand. The brownies, who were first-grade boys, made their 
caps and suits in class. A boy, who took the part of a professor, 
made his four-cornered cap and hemmed a borrowed coat to its 
proper length. Santa made his costume in class, as did each 
member. ‘The teacher claimed no responsibility, but rather 
acted as an adviser and pushed or urged the work along. The 
stage furniture was made by the manual-training class; for in- 
stance, a screen was needed and was made by the class. ‘The 
sixth-grade girls covered the frames with strips that the boys 
measured and cut from old window-shades that we had on 
hand. Designs were cut for invitations and the best selected 
for use. 
READING 
First-grade stories about Santa, his reindeer, and his helpers 
were told, read, and dramatized. Short poems were memorized 
by the class; a few were chosen as numbers on our programme. 
Our welcome was learned by each first-grader and was given by 
one, chosen by the class, who could give it well. The play, 
readings, and songs were all taken up at this time for expression 
drills as well as dramatization work. The plays were read and 
discussed in class. Characters were then chosen for the different 
parts and each one began the task of preparing himself for it. 
(The class chose the characters for the different parts.) 
ARITHMETIC 
Much was done in measurements. The fireplace had to be 
measured and cut so that the parts would fit. The paper cov-
-P-A-G-E-82
64 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
ering and bricks were all cut to scale. The screen called for the 
same kind of work. The frieze called for measurements of vari- 
ous types. The first-grade sand-table work, such as Santa’s 
house, his sleigh, his reindeer, and his packages, all called for 
measurements. The domestic-science class apportioned the food 
supply among the district members. This called for practical 
arithmetic. Cost of food, as well as time and labor in prepara- 
tion, was considered. The steps in this problem were as follows: 
1. District members counted. Number of children, or the total 
number expected. 
2. What to serve? Decided: Popcorn balls, apples, doughnuts, 
and coffee. 
3. Size of the family which was going to furnish some materials. 
How much they should bring. 
Discussion as to cost of each article of food. Popcorn was. 
not as costly as doughnuts, etc. Labor connected with 
each. No preparation for apples, therefore they were 
assigned to mothers who had small children and to whom 
time was precious. Cream for coffee assigned to dairy 
farmers. Later we decided that the domestic-science 
class, be responsible for the making and serving of the 
coffee. Lunch was served by the class. Se

WRITING, OR PENMANSHIP 
The form of the invitation chosen in the language and the de- 
sign selected in handwork were to be combined now. Each 
child wrote his own invitation for his people. This took con- 
siderable practice before he was suited with his writing. Extra 
invitations were written by the best penmen for members who
-P-A-G-E-83
  THE COMMUNITY CENTER 65 
did not have people in school. Invitations were delivered by 
the writer. 
Programs were neatly written and sent home, so that the 
people knew what to expect. 
All the written language work for exhibition must be con- 
sidered here. 
GEOGRAPHY AND History 
Many places of interest were located in the stories about 
Christ. The stories brought out considerable history, especially 
the history of that age.

In order to summarize the important points to be 
considered in organizing and planning a community 
center the following has been added: 
(1) The teacher should visit all the homes in the dis- 
trict and invite the patrons to attend a community 
meeting at the schoolhouse to see something of the 
work of the school. 
(2) Select the most convenient date for the first 
meeting and advertise it widely by personal invitation 
. by the pupils, by calls over the telephone, and by items 
in the newspaper. : 
(3) The program for the first meeting should contain 
three or four demonstrations of the actual work of the 
school. The teacher should introduce this work with 
a tactful suggestion that at each of the community- 
center meetings some of the regular work of the school 
will be shown to give parents and other taxpayers an 
opportunity to see the results of the expenditure of 
their money and note the progress made by the school 
from time to time. 
Some kinds of school work which lend themselves 
very well to a place on the community-center program 
are: primary reading, phonics, drills, dramatized reading- 
lessons, compositions written for the language class and 
read by the writers, rhythm drills and singing by the 
school, especially with the Victrola; experiments and 
tests in geography, agriculture, and home economics;  
-P-A-G-E-85
Ce: THE COMMUNITY CENTER 67 
rapid drills in the fundamental operations in arithmetic, 
and the working of practical problems at the board; 
and spelling from such a list as the “One Hundred 
Demons” or the “Thousand Words in Most Common 
Use,” the competition being based on the idea of show- 
ing that every pupil in a competing group is perfect in 
his spelling of the whole list of common words. 
(4) Explain tactfully that these meetings are not 
school entertainments, and that they are not old- 
fashioned lyceums or -debating societies. Call atten- 
tion to the fact that they are held in the schoolhouse 
because the school is the one organization which is sup- 
ported by all the people, and that some of the regular 
school work will be shown to give the community some 
idea of the progress of the school. Explain that it is 
the purpose of the organization to lead to constant dis- 
cussion of those problems of most immediate concern 
to the community. 
(5) Introduce on the first program some members of 
the community or outside speakers who have person- 
ally been invited by you. to speak on timely subjects in 
which they are much interested. 
(6) Plan your program carefully so that it is not too 
long. Place your best number last and following it in- 
vite the people to gather at the schoolhouse once each 
month for similar meetings. Mingle with patrons after 
meeting. 
(7) Suggest that, as a teacher, you would like to have 
the community elect two members of a program com- 
mittee to serve with you in planning the work of the 
organization. Urge the people to do this. If théy do 
not, then appoint the two additional members your- " 
self. 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
    68 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
(8) Develop all the initiative and leadership you can 
in your helpers by urging them to take the lead while 
you remain in the background. BUT SEE TO IT 
THAT THINGS ARE KEPT MOVING. 
(9) Bring all the important interests representing your 
community into your community-center meetings, and 
give each a hearing there. 
(to) Outside speakers are usually glad to have an 
opportunity to appear before these meetings. The 
county superintendent, county demonstration agents, 
physicians, bankers, Red Cross workers, county agents, 
county supervisors, township trustees, school directors, 
ministers, and other public-spirited citizens have been 
found very willing to address these meetings. 
(11) The teacher may skillfully point out the needs of 
the school, which the people will appreciate more fully 
when they are assembled in the schoolhouse and can 
see the conditions. To require parents to sit for two 
hours in the poor seats of a schoolhouse is often a most 
eloquent argument. 
(12) The teacher may further interest the patrons of 
the district by arranging an exhibit of hand work done 
by the pupils and placing it on exhibition during the 
evening of the community-center meeting. Nearly 
every community organization of people feel that the 
evening is not complete without having something to 
eat. 
Below are some of the programs that have been given 
in the community-center meetings in the rural demon- 
stration schools around Cedar Falls, Iowa, during the 
past, and are typical of those which have proved most 
successful:

It will be noted that in these programs there are four 
phases stressed; not all phases occur each time how- 
ever. 
1. The Children’s Part——The speaking of miscel- 
laneous pieces that really have no merit in them is dis- 
couraged, but some of their actual daily work is used. 
The children are not drilled and trained for the occasion, 
but they simply prepare their recitations and appear 
before the parents and patrons in a class recitation the 
same as they would when regular school is in session. 
This enables the parents to see some actual school work 
and brings the parents in touch with the teacher’s 
method of instruction. 
2. The People of the Community—This type of pro- 
gram is different in that the children are not to do all 
of the appearing on the program, allowing the parents 
and young people to sit and look on. The people of 
the community, both old and young, will be invited and 
urged to do their share to help bring about a community 
consciousness. This can be done by staging community 
plays, community singing, debates, special club pro- 
grams, and farm women’s meetings of various kinds.
-P-A-G-E-89
       2 | 
THE COMMUNITY CENTER 71 
When the people take an active part they become in- 
terested in their community center. 
3. The Outside Speaker.—There are many people out- 
side the community who would be glad to take part on 
the program for the good of the community and the 
cause of education. Any community needs the inspira- 
tion that can be brought to it by the local banker, post- 
master, pastor, lawyer, the county superintendent, the 
county agent, or any one who has a message of cheer 
and value. Usually an invitation from the teacher or 
members of the community is sufficient. However, 
only those who have a message should be invited. 
4. The Social Hour—A community program would 
not be complete without the social phase. This usually 
means something to eat, and affords opportunity for 
neighbors to chat and discuss local topics of interest. 
This is one part of a community-center program in 
which every lady of the neighborhood may take part. 
It has always been the policy of those who conduct these 
programs to have a different committee in charge of 
the lunch for each month. In this way every family 
of the community enters into the responsibility for the 
success of the community center sometime during the 
year. 
The following suggestive sentences are gleaned from 
the reports sent in by the demonstration-school teachers 
concerning their community-center meetings. 
“Our patrons attend best when their children have a part on 
the program.” 
“Our people are particularly fond of good music.” 
“Debates by local people always make a strong program.” 
“The work of the children always takes very well.” 
“The people seem to appreciate refreshments, too.”
-P-A-G-E-90
  
72 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
“We try to have a member of each family take some part in 
each program.” 
“On nice evenings, our people like to play outdoor games.”’ 
“Our people are especially interested in the school work of 
the pupils, such as contests in good reading.” 
“We like best the programs in which the people of the com- 
munity have an active part.” 
“All the parents were present at our last meeting.” 
“Our attendance is better when the children have a promi- 
nent part.” 
“With the exception of one number, all of our last program 
was given by the young people of the community.” 
“At our last meeting, the schoolhouse was so crowded that 
any accurate count was impossible.” 
“Mixed programs please the people in our district.” 
“The people here are much interested in seeing the regular 
school work of the pupils.” 
QUESTIONS 
1. Justify the amount of time spent by the teacher in organizing 
a community center. 
. Why is the school the best place in which to organize a com- 
munity center? 
3- In what points do you consider a community center pro- 
gram differs from ordinary programs held at a country

ing people. Three families of old people; no children in 
school now; heavy taxpayers. Three families of young 
married people; renters; no apparent interest in school; 
wives are high-school graduates; one husband an agri- 
cultural man. One family that has two children in

. Explain just how you would proceed to secure the people of 
the neighborhood to appear on the program. 
. Why should the people of the’ neighborhood take part on 
these programs ?

CHAPTER IV 
THE ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 
OF SCHOOLS 
The history of school organization and administra- 
tion is too broad a subject to admit of comprehensive 
treatment in a book like this. However, a knowledge 
of existing forms of organization and their development 
is so essential for the rural teacher that a general discus- 
sion of rural school districts and their officers must be 
given. 
Public Education and Evolution.—The present sys- 
tems of organization and administration in our public 
schools are the result of a slow and gradual evolution. 
Horace A. Hollister says: “The nineteenth and the first 
decade of the twentieth centuries have staged no more 
remarkable action in the world’s drama than the evolu- 
tion of public education.” * 
At first education was administered almost solely by 
the church, the main motive being the general propa- 
gation of religious doctrines. Individual enterprises for 
the promotion of education occasionally sprang up, but 
the idea of a system of public education administered 
by trained experts developed very slowly in most coun- 
tries. 
Growth of the Idea of Democracy.—The growth of 
the idea of democracy has been one of the powerful 
factors in the development of sentiment favoring a sys- 
tem of public education. It has made the leaders of 
* Horace A. Hollister, The Administration of Education in a Democracy.

thought realize the importance and need of universal 
education. This has been especially true in the United 
States. If we are to retain the free institutions for 
which our fathers fought we must maintain a complete 
and universal system of education. A republic must 
have an educated citizenship. 
Colonists Recognized the Importance of Education.— 
A study of the history of our earliest colonies reveals the 
fact that from the very first a free government and a 
system of universal education were developed side by 
side. While all of the colonies shared more or less in 
this evolution, it developed most rapidly in Massa- 
chusetts. The essential features of a free common- 
school system as we now have it in all of the States of 
the Union were formulated there as early as 1642 and 
1647. 
Education Left to States.—When the framers of our 
national Constitution met, no provision was made for a 
national system of education. By common consent 
the entire organization and management of our public 
schools was left to the States. As a result of this policy 
of non-interference in the domain of public education 
by the Federal Government, several of the colonies, 
when they advanced to Statehood by the adoption of 
State constitutions, made provision in those constitu- 
tions for systems of public education. Two States 
stand out prominently in the early development of a 
system of public education; viz., Massachusetts and 
North Carolina. The former, because of the fullness of 
statement in her constitution, readily became a pattern 
for the other New England colonies, and later for the 
States of the Northwest Territory. Similarly, North 
Carolina became a model for the Southern States.
-P-A-G-E-95
  ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION eh 
Two Types of Organization.—A study of the provi- 
sions for public education as made in the constitutions 
of some of the States reveals to us two dominant types 
of organization. One type is perhaps most clearly 
shown in the constitution of Massachusetts. In it are 
the ideals of the Pilgrims as they were evolved out of 
their colonial experiences. Their government was dis- 
tinctively republican in form, but their management of a 
system of education was essentially democratic. The 
other type of school organization is that established in 
the Southern colonies. Out of the peculiar system of 
landholding established in the South there developed 
what is known as the county unit of control. 
Local Control.—As the Federal Government passed 
the responsibility of the administration of our public 
schools to the States, so the States in turn through their 
constitutions and laws passed on that responsibility to 
the local communities. In fact, the decentralizing in- 
fluences which were at work at that time had a marked 
effect on the organization of the schools. It was then 
that the idea of the school district as the local admin- 
istrative unit became so firmly established in our edu- 
cational system. 
Size of Local Unit.—This brings us to the considera- 
tion of one of the most important factors in the organi- 
zation of our school system; that is, the size of the edu- 
cational units of territory. Shall the local school unit 
from which the children are brought together for school 
purposes be so small that they can conveniently walk 
to and from school? Or, shall it be extended so as to 
make the transportation of the children necessary, and, 
if so, shall the school district be responsible for such 
transportation? Again, shall the territory to be in-
-P-A-G-E-96
78 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
cluded in one school organization for the purpose of 
taxation be limited to the area from which the children 
go to a single school? Or, shall it embrace the territory 
of several schools, so that the taxes may be spread uni- 
formly over a larger area, and the people who are living 
either in the more prosperous sections or in sections 
where the expenses of conducting a school are for the 
time being low, be made to help maintain the schocls of 
those who are less fortunately situated? These are 
questions that have been prominently before the pub- 
lic since the formation of State governments, and are 
to-day the fuel for more heated discussions than any 
other school question. 
Reasons for Earlier Small Units——The primary rea- 
son for the small unit was the fact that it was generally 
the most convenient and equitable arrangement under 
the existing social conditions. Also, the early connec- 
tion of education with religion and its dependence upon 
the church for the administrative functions had much 
to do with the arrangement of units for school adminis- 
tration. As the congregation was the group to which 
the church ministered, so naturally the administration 
of educational affairs was similarly limited. Again, 
from the standpoint of taxation, the idea that general 
intelligence was a direct gain to the whole of society and 
well worth paying for had not yet fully developed. 
Popularity of Smaller District Units.—The idea that 
the school should be an institution that is local both in 
government and maintenance has always been a pop- 
ular one. People like to have their own school as they 
want it, without interference or dictation from authori- 
ties outside of their own immediate community. They 
want to determine for themselves the kind of school
-P-A-G-E-97
ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 79 
building and equipment that they will have, the length 
of the school year, the salary to be paid the teacher, and 
the program of studies. They are also not inclined to 
assume financial responsibility for the support of schools 
outside of their own immediate vicinity. 
Tendency Toward Larger Units.—With the increase 
in population in this country, especially in our cities and 
towns, with the development of our system of good 
public roads and rapid means of transportation, and 
with a more definite realization on the part of the public 
of what is needed for the successful administration of 
our schools, there has come a reaction against the small 
unit. The conditions which made a small district de- 
sirable in the earlier times no longer prevail. Legisla- 
tion in most of the States has, therefore, gradually 
tended more and more toward the larger units of or- 
ganization and more strongly centralized control of our 
schools. 
Modern Types of Rural School Organization.—At 
present three distinct types of rural school districts still 
retain the essential principles of local control. All three 
types either have prevailed at some time in the past, 
or do now prevail, in one form or another in the New 
England States and north of the Mason and Dixon line. 
They are (1) the Local District Unit, (2) the Township 
Unit, and (3) the Consolidated District. 
The Local District——The local school district is 
known by different names in different States, such as 
Rural Independent District or Common School Dis- 
trict. Whatever the name, the general plan of admin- 
istrative practice is strikingly similar throughout the 
several States in which it prevails. There is usually a 
board of three school officers, known as directors or 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
80 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
trustees. In the most extreme forms of this type of 
school units, it has been the duty of this school board 
to levy the school taxes, supervise the erection or re- 
pairs of the schoolhouse, furnish the necessary supplies 
for the school, employ the teacher, select text-books, and 
determine the course of study and rules governing the 
school. In fact, the board controls all of the adminis- 
trative functions of the school under its control. A 
more recent tendency, however, in many States where 
this type of organization still prevails, has been to modify 
to a greater or less degree the powers and duties of the 
board, and to place such responsibility as the selection 
of text-books and the making of a course of study in 
the hands of administrative officers of the township, 
county, or State. 
The Township Unit.—The beginning of the town or 
township as a unit in the administration of school 
affairs is associated with the town meetings of the New 
England States. As it was extended throughout the 
country, however, it varied considerably in form from 
the New England type. There the township meant a 
settlement of people about a common center or village. 
In the West under the Congressional Survey, a township 
means a piece of land six miles square without any rela- 
tion to population. The township unit differs essen- 
tially from the local district unit in two respects. First, 
it contains a larger area for the purpose of taxation. If 
the Congressional township, for instance, is the territory 
included in a school township, as is frequently the case, 
it means that the school taxes are levied equally over 
the entire thirty-six square miles for the support of all 
of the schools within that area. Thus it tends to 
equalize the financial responsibility among a larger
-P-A-G-E-99
  ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 81 
group of citizens. Secondly, the operation of the schools 
in the township unit is in the hands of a board that is 
influenced less by local sentiment. 
The size of the school board in the township unit 
varies greatly in the different States. Indiana, for in- 
stance, has one member, a trustee. In Iowa, on the 
other hand, there is a director for each subdistrict, 
which means a board of from three to nine or more for 
each township. It is the duty of this board to provide 
schools for the entire township, just as does the board 
for one school in a local district. 
The Consolidated District—The two types of school 
districts that have been discussed are the units in which 
the one-teacher school essentially prevails. The school 
unit that is coming to be most generally known as the 
Consolidated District differs primarily from both of the 
other types. It brings together at a central place 
through a system of transportation enough pupils to 
make possible the organization of a modern graded- 
school system with several teachers under the direction 
of a trained supervising officer. As the name indicates, 
it is a district brought about by the consolidation of 
several units into one large school unit. It resembles, 
therefore, the school township in that it provides an 
area large enough for taxation purposes to make it pos- 
sible to maintain a good school. In the matter of ad- 
ministration it resembles the local unit; it has one 
board which makes provision for all of the children at 
one central school within the district. 
The County Unit.—As has been previously stated, the 
South, because of the peculiar system of landholding 
established there, developed a system of school admin- 
istration in which the county was made the local unit. 
In most of the Southern States, a county board has gen-
-P-A-G-E-100
82 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
eral charge of school affairs. This board issues instruc- 
tions to the local trustees or directors, who, in turn, must 
report to it concerning the local schools. Two facts 
stand out in regard to the county unit plan. The unit 
of taxation is so much larger than any of the local unit 
types that very little difficulty is encountered in financ- 
ing equal educational opportunities for all of the chil- 
dren of the county. Again, the unit is large enough to 
make it possible in administration to provide expert 
supervision for the rural schools equal to that provided 
in city school systems. 
The County as a Unit for Supervision.—Thus far this 
discussion has considered school units primarily from 
the standpoints of taxation and of local administration. 
It should be noted that most of the States have recog- 
nized the county as the best unit for the purpose of 
professional supervision. Through the Central West, 
especially, the office of county superintendent carries 
with it important duties and powers. He inspects the 
schools, has general supervision of, and frequently con- 
trols, the certification of teachers, conducts teachers’ 
institutes for the improvement of the teachers in service, 
and performs such other duties as may be required of 
him by law. 
The State as a Unit.—While it is true that the earlier 
States passed on, as has been said, the responsibility for 
the administration of the schools to the local communi- 
ties, the general tendency toward centralization, since 
then, has resulted in placing some important administra- 
tive functions in the hands of a State school official. 
Various names are given to that official in the different 
States, such as commissioner of education, superin- 
tendent of public instruction, or secretary of the State 
Board of Education. Some of the important adminis- 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
  
ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 83 
trative functions assigned to this official are (1) the super- 
vision of school officials; (2) holding of conventions of 
county and city superintendents; (3) issuing and revok- 
ing of State teachers’ certificates; (4) the making of an 
annual or biennial report on the conditions of the 
schools of the State; (5) and a general stimulative super- 
vision of the entire school system. 
A Typical Mid-Western County.—The accompany- 
ing map of Black Hawk County, Iowa, is presented for 
several reasons. 
First, it shows the extent to which local “self-deter- 
mination” may be carried in the organization of school 
districts. Notice the irregular boundaries of many of 
the school corporations. 
Second, it clearly shows the different types of local 
school units: (1) the rural independent organization with 
a one-teacher school; (2) the school township with several 
one-room schools; (3) the consolidated district with one 
central graded school; (4) the city and town districts 
with their several graded schools. ; 
Third, it shows the variations in the size of the ter- 
ritory that supports a single school. 
Fourth, it shows the great inequalities in the educa- 
tional opportunities offered to the country children. 
District No. 6 contains one of the finest rural consoli- 
dated schools in the United States, while within a few 
miles of it are to be found one-room schools which meet 
only the minimum legal requirements. 
Fifth, it shows the absolute separation of school gov- 
ernment from civil government. The civil county of 
Black Hawk is sixteen miles square. The school cor- 
poration boundaries follow neither Congressional, town- 
ship, nor civil county lines.

  RELATION OF TEACHER TO ADMINISTRATIVE AND 
SUPERVISORY OFFICERS 
1. To the School Board. 
Securing a Position.—One may apply for several 
positions at the same time. The uncertainty of elec- 
tion often makes this necessary. As soon as a position
-P-A-G-E-103
   ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 85 
has been accepted, other applications should be with- 
drawn and no further effort should be made to secure 
another position. A personal interview with the school 
board should always be sought when making applica- 
tion. It will prove more satisfactory to both board and 
teacher. If the application must be made in writing, 
it should consist of a short, clear-cut, well-written state- 
ment of the facts that concern a board when hiring a 
teacher. Age, training, and previous experience, if any, 
should be given. Any special qualifications that the 
teacher thinks she possesses for that particular position 
may be modestly mentioned. A recent photograph may 
be enclosed. References to responsible parties should 
be given instead of the general “to whom it may con- 
cern” type of recommendation. A personal letter to 
the school board from some one who can speak intelli- 
gently of the ability of the applicant is ot value. 
Contract.—A teacher should obtain a contract from 
the school board after she has accepted a position. It 
should be made in duplicate, and one copy filed with 
the president or secretary of the. board. The contract 
should always specify the term of employment, the 
salary, and the mode of payment. Other items may 
well be mentioned in order to avoid misunderstandings. 
Such are: when and under what conditions vacations 
may be held; what holidays shall be observed; who shall 
provide for the janitor service; time lost due to closing 
of school on account of pupils’ illness, bad roads, or bad 
weather. In some States some of these questions are 
answered by law or court decisions. In others they 
frequently lead to litigation. The teacher should never 
abandon her contract. An opportunity for promotion 
may present itself to a teacher and she may desire re-  
-P-A-G-E-104
  86 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
lease from her contract. If so, she should state her 
case to the board, and ask them to give the matter con- 
sideration. If they feel that releasing her would prove 
detrimental to the school, then she should carry out the 
conditions of the contract. Any other course would be 
dishonorable. 
Responsibility as to Equipment.—The teacher has a 
twofold relationship toward the board in the matter 
of equipment. First, it devolves upon her very largely 
to decide as to the kind and amount of equipment that 
the school authorities should provide. The teacher 
should have the courage to ask for needed supplies and 
equipment. On the other hand, she should only ask for 
those things which she knows she can and will use. 
Economy of expenditure should be considered as well 
as magnitude of results. 
Second, the teacher, when she signs a contract and 
enters upon her duties, assumes a responsibility for the 
care of the school equipment. She is the paid represen- 
tative of the school board, and, as such, it is her duty to 
watch with due care and diligence over the school equip- 
ment. A teacher may be successful in her method of 
instruction and yet fail miserably because she does not 
appreciate her responsibility in this matter. The 
teacher, then, should use the same watchfulness and 
strictness, both in the asking for and the care of equip- 
ment, that she would if she herself had to foot the 
bill. 
Daily Register and Reports.—Teachers are required 
to make certain reports to the school board. Usually 
these reports are to be filed with the secretary or clerk 
of the board. The nature of the reports that are re- 
quired varies in different States. The teacher should 
   
-P-A-G-E-105
  ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 87 
learn from the county superintendent which reports are 
to be made to the school board. She should then make 
her reports at the appointed time. Care should be ex- 
ercised in the making of the report. It should be com- 
plete and neat. A complete record of attendance, work 
covered, and grades earned, should be kept in every 
school and left for the successor. This register should be 
kept up to date and open to inspection by the county 
superintendent, the school board, or patrons, at all times. 
2. To the County Superintendent. 
Supervision—No system of schools can run success- 
fully without adequate supervision. The teacher may 
be ever so skillful and the equipment excellent, but still 
there must be some competent authority to unify and 
direct. The rural school especially should not be left 
without supervision. The rural teachers need and have 
a right to the help that comes from sympathetic over- 
sight. 
The county superintendent is the official in most 
States whose special function it is to oversee the work 
of the rural schools. The duties imposed upon this 
official are so numerous and the unit for organization 
is so large that little personal supervision is possible. 
Therefore, the superintendent must do his supervisory 
work in other ways. 
Certification.—The State demands that a person, be- 
fore entering upon the duties of teaching, must be legally 
authorized by the State to teach. The salary of the 
teacher is obtained through taxation. The public, 
therefore, through State laws, reserves the right to say 
what conditions as to scholarship, personality, and char- 
acter must be met by the prospective teacher. It is 
the intent and purpose of these laws to exclude from the 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
88 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
schools, as teachers, immature, incompetent, or immoral 
persons. 
The certificating of teachers is usually done through 
the office of county superintendent. In the earlier pe- 
riods of our State histories, this work was done entirely 
by that official through a system of examinations. In 
recent years much of this authority has been delegated 
to the State Department of Public Instruction or to 
State boards. This has resulted in a more unified sys- 
tem of certification. The county superintendent is the 
official, however, through whom applications for certifi- 
cates are made. Another recent .development in cer- 
tificating teachers is the growing tendency to abolish 
examinations and to substitute in lieu thereof special 
training and preparation for teaching. 
Educational Meetings.—The county superintendent, 
as has been said, cannot do much by personal super- 
vision. Teachers’ meetings, therefore, are some of the 
most effective means that he has for giving assistance to 
his teachers. Most States provide by law for some 
form of professional teachers’ meetings. Others are or- 
ganized and conducted by the county superintendent 
according to the needs of the county. All such meet- 
ings should be attended by the teachers and used as a 
means for professional improvement. The help, per- 
sonal acquaintance, and inspiration that are received 
at such meetings will greatly repay the teacher for the 
time and effort required. The interest and enthusiasm 
shown by the teachers at such meetings give the county 
superintendent a real index as to the professional spirit 
‘and value of the teacher. 
Professional Reading.—In most States there are 
reading-circle organizations. The purpose of these or-
-P-A-G-E-107
ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 89 
ganizations is to give teachers assistance and directions 
in professional reading. A teacher should read and 
study one or more good up to date professional books 
while she is teaching. The county superintendent 
should be consulted in regard to the selection of the 
best books. A professionally minded teacher in the 
course of a few years acquires a good working library. 
It is an inspiration to the county superintendent, when 
visiting a teacher, to find upon her desk several good 
professional books. 
Co-operating with the County Superintendent.— 
Aggressive county superintendents depend very largely 
upon general campaigns for the improvement of their 
schools. Physical education programs, health programs, 
thrift campaigns, special efforts to improve the work in 
certain subjects, and other campaigns are conducted. 
To get results in these campaigns, the superintendent 
must have the whole-hearted and enthusiastic support 
and co-operation of the teachers. If a “Play Day” is 
planned for the county, every teacher should feel that 
she is an integral part of that plan. If she fails, and a 
few others do likewise, the entire plan is in danger of 
failure. The program, if worth while at all, is worth 
doing well in every school. The teacher should not ques- 
tion the desirability of the campaign. That decision is 
one of the specific functions of the supervising official. 
Reports.—The teacher is required to make certain re- 
ports to the county superintendent. These reports are 
one of the means that the superintendent has of getting 
needed information concerning the school. The follow- 
ing items concerning the reports are especially stressed. 
First. Promptness. To the prospective teacher this 
advice will seem commonplace. The experienced teacher
-P-A-G-E-108
90 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
however, knows how fully the time is occupied with 
other duties, and how easy it is to say to herself: “TI will 
make it out next Saturday.”’ When Saturday comes 
other duties again take up the time, and before the 
teacher realizes it she forgets to send it in at all. If 
your county superintendent asks for a report at the 
close of the first day of school, send it at the close of that 
day. Find out before school opens what reports are 
required, and get the necessary blanks. 
Second. Completeness. An examination of the re- 
ports received by the county superintendent’s office will 
show that a teacher will even fail to indicate the name 
of the school or to sign her own name. If she does not 
know how to make out a term report, she should not 
be backward in consulting her county superintendent. 
Not to know how to make the report is not a disgrace, 
but it is little less to send in to the county superintendent 
one that is incomplete. 
Third. Neatness. These reports are placed on file 
in the office of the superintendent for future inspection 
and reference. Therefore, to send in reports neat and 
attractive in appearance should be of personal interest 
to the teacher. 
3. To the State Superintendent. 
The State superintendent is an important factor in 
rural school supervision. Through his influence courses 
of study have been adopted and the requirements for 
teachers shaped and unified. Bulletins on rural school 
improvement are published. Programs for special days 
and other helpful material are issued. The teacher 
should avail herself of all such helps and should en- 
deavor to carry out in her own school the plans that the 
superintendent makes for the State as a whole.

CHAPTER V 
ATTENDANCE RECORDS AND REPORTS 
Section I 
ATTENDANCE 
Schools are maintained to educate children. This 
function cannot be performed unless the children pre- 
sent themselves for instruction every day that the school 
is in session. Regularity of attendance is, therefore, 
very essential to the success of any school. 
Standpoint of Citizenship—Punctuality and regu- 
larity in attending to any set task are virtues of the 
greatest merit and importance. Children who receive 
such training in school will be better citizens. The 
school is maintained for the purpose of placing the 
highest ideals of citizenship before the child. But it is 
possible that the very institution that is maintained for 
this purpose may be developing poor citizens. 
When the child is allowed to be tardy and absent at 
any time, and nothing is done to stop it, his citizen 
training will be negative: first, because he does not 
form the habit of being punctual, which is essential to 
good citizenship, and second, because school attendance 
increases the possibility for citizenship training and gen- 
eral uplift for those in attendance. It is held now that 
the best citizen is the one who receives at least the 
equivalent of an eighth-grade education. Investiga- 
tions have revealed that America is a nation of sixth- 
graders. This is a sad comment on our American edu-

cational system. Individuals who have not taken ad- 
vantage of the schools of the nation not only have 
handicapped themselves in the struggle for a living, but 
have lowered the average standard of efficiency for the 
nation. 
Standpoint of the Taxpayer—The problem of school 
attendance is important from the economic standpoint. 
The careful business man checks his investment against 
his income. If there is a reasonable profit, he is satis- 
fied. School attendance and the sum total of all the 
ideals that children receive while attending are the in- 
come. ‘Teachers’ salaries, supplies, equipment, and fuel 
are the investment. The taxpayer is the investor. The 
expense of the school will be the same even if half of the 
children stay at home. That is, the taxpayer pays for 
the education of all the children of school age. But 
when some of the children are absent, and are, therefore, 
receiving no benefit from the school, the taxpayers lose 
on their investment in proportion to the number of 
children who are absent. 
The following illustrations will help make this point 
clear. In computing attendance the percentage of at- 
tendance gives an accurate means of comparison. The 
average percentage ef attendance in the one-teacher 
rural schools in a certain county was 75%. The high- 
est was 95%, and the lowest 60%. Assuming that the 
teacher in each case was receiving $100 per month, let 
“ us consider the taxpayers’ loss. In the case of the highest 
$5 per month was lost, of the average for the county 
$25, and of the lowest $40. Statistics from all over the 
United States show that the average daily attendance 
in all the public schools, including village,. rural, and 
town schools, is less than 75% of the number enrolled. 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
94 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
Stand point of Teacher.—Irregular attendance has been 
found by teachers to be one of the most serious hin- 
drances to the teaching of the school. Nothing is more 
discouraging to the teacher than to have a class nicely 
organized and thoroughly interested, and then have one 
or two pupils drop out for a day or two at a time. Not 
only the pupils who drop out lose much, but the whole 
class is handicapped. A double effort must be put forth 
by the teacher to get those pupils back into the proper 
attitude when they return. It means extra hours after 
school, or at odd times during the day. Such a condi- 
tion may cause the unfortunate pupils to so lose interest 
that they will drop out of school and never return. 
Some of the most common effects on pupils, teacher, 
and the school itself can be summed up as follows: 
(a) Lack of interest on the part of pupils concerned. 
(0) Failures and lack of promotion. 
(c) Dropping out of school permanently. 
(d) The giving of extra time on the part of the teacher. 
(e) Retarding other pupils. 
REASONS FOR [IRREGULARITIES 
School Environment.—Unattractive school buildings 
and grounds have much to do with poor attendance. 
The buildings may not be painted. Fences are down. 
Maps, desks, and equipment are out of order; in fact, 
everything indicates no interest. Uncomfortable school- 
rooms never attract children. Poor seating, lighting, 
and ventilation add much to their discomfort. Enthu- 
siasm and spirit seem to be in proportion to the sur- 
roundings. 
Dislike for Teacher and School Work.—Many times 
misunderstandings occur between the teacher and pupil.
-P-A-G-E-113
ATTENDANCE RECORDS AND REPORTS 95 
There are so many ways in whicn this may happen. 
This in itself is sufficient reason for many children to 
think of excuses for non-attendance. If many of the 
good qualities discussed in the chapter on “The Teacher” 
are found wanting, then the children must be driven to 
school every morning. They will not attend, because 
they know that they will not be in the presence of an 
inspiring teacher. Teachers oftentimes do not moti- 
vate their work. Old methods are applied in the same 
old way, and children cannot become interested. The 
course of study has until recently centered around the 
supervisor or the pedagogue and not around the child. 
The child has been required to “take” certain subjects 
as he would take medicine. Too often neither his pres- 
ent interest nor the world outside, that he must soon 
enter, has been considered. No one can blame a child 
for not wishing to attend school under such conditions. 
Home Work and Uninterested Parents ——Children are 
kept out of school by the parents for various reasons. 
Frequently the reason is given that they are needed for 
work at home. While teachers should not object to 
pupils being absent for matters of real importance, they 
should bear in mind that the chief business of the child 
is attendance at school. Many parents would send their 
children regularly if they understood just what it meant 
to keep them out. A certain mother protested vigor- 
ously when her little daughter was not promoted to the 
next grade. The little girl had been absent a total of 
twenty days during the year, but never for more than 
one day at a time. When this fact was presented to the 
mother she admitted that it had been her own fault. 
The next year her daughter had a perfect record of 
attendance. 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
96 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
There are some parents who would sacrifice the future 
happiness of their children for a few paltry dollars. 
Such parents mortgage their cnildren’s success. The 
compulsory attendance law should be applied with all 
its power to such parents. 
How to Improve Attendance.—Make School Work 
Interesting. —Interest is the keynote of success in the 
schoolroom. The teacher who spends time and energy 
in planning an interesting program never has to worry 
about attendance. This program includes such items 
as the following: (1) interesting and varying opening 
exercises; (2) well planned classwork; (3) properly super- 
vised intermissions; (4) student organizations. Open- 
ing exercises give the teacher an opportunity to bring 
many interesting topics before the school. Nothing is 
more deadening than to have the same type of opening 
exercises every morning. The teacher must make plans 
for this important period, because if the boys and girls 
realize that something “‘new” is sure to happen, they 
will make an effort not only to be there but be on time. 
Patriotic exercises, current events, dramatizations, dia- 
logues, reports, spelling and arithmetic contests, picture 
study, and many other worth while activities might be 
used which would attract every child and cause him to 
have a desire to be in school. 
The product that means most in the business of teach- 
ing is the output of the classroom. This is made up 
of interest, enthusiasm, and a desire for more knowledge. 
The teacher who thoughtfully plans her daily recita- 
tions, striving to bring in new interesting material each 
day, will not have much trouble about poor attendance. 
The normal pupil who sits at the feet of a good teacher 
is blessed. She leads him into the foundation material
-P-A-G-E-115
ATTENDANCE RECORDS AND REPORTS 97 
for future ideals, by superior teaching, motivation, cor- 
relation, and practical illustration. In geography, field 
trips are taken; samples of various rocks are brought to 
class by the teacher; pictures of various countries show- 
ing the customs of the people are brought to the class. 
The teacher is leading the anxious learner on through 
interesting materials. Likewise in every subject there 
will be something that the teacher can do to strengthen 
the desire to know more about the topic in hand. If 
the teacher discovers a lack of interest in any subject, 
it would be well for her to look at herself and her methods 
before criticising any one else. 
In the chapters on “Physical Education”? much em- 
phasis is placed upon the supervision of play on the play- 
ground and in the schoolroom. This emphasis is given 
largely because a supervised play period is all conducive 
to a great deal of interest and enthusiasm. The teacher 
will manage to keep every one “busy” playing. Whole- 
some contest games increase school spirit. The chil- 
dren look forward with a good deal of pleasure to inter- 
missions. They will make every effort to be present in 
order to play on the “team.”’ Naturally if the right 
spirit prevails upon the playground that same spirit will 
continue to prevail in the schoolroom. The play period 
is one of the social-training periods that boys: and girls 
enjoy while on the school ground. Wholesome social 
life which gives real enjoyment during intermissions will 
increase the interest in school attendance. Children 
enjoy association together in clubs and literary societies. 
Holding office, voting, and taking part in regular pro- 
grams wholly managed by the pupils themselves add 
interest to school work. The teacher can well afford to 
formulate bird clubs, poultry clubs, and other organiza-
-P-A-G-E-116
  98 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
tions for the purpose of gaining valuable information 
and experience. Children will be anxious to attend a 
school in which they have some vital interest and where 
they are copartners with the teacher. 
Organize a Community Center or a Parent-Teacher 
Association—In chapter III emphasis is placed upon 
the community center. The organization of a parent- 
teacher association, with the school as the center of 
interest, will do much toward cementing all of the 
community interests. Parents will have such a feel- 
ing of partnership that they will not keep their chil- 
dren out of school. Teachers who are active in these 
organizations learn to know the parents so well that 
they can discuss attendance and its effect on scholar- 
ship and progress in school. Many parents do not ap- 
preciate what a few days’ absence may mean to their 
child. When they are shown the results in a tactful, 
kind way much good is done. 
Formulate Attendance Contests—Better attendance has 
been accomplished by working out a race between differ- 
ent classes in the school. This method, of course, is not 
a natural means of securing the desired end. Such con- 
tests may secure the desired end without burdening 
any one. These good-natured races can be staged 
within the same school, or two teachers who wish to 
arouse a little spirit of contest between their schools 
could plan such a race for a period of two months or a 
term. 
Awards for Perfect Attendance.—The giving of simple 
awards for perfect attendance is a common practice. 
‘These awards usually consist of a certificate, diploma, or 
pin. They are given not because of their intrinsic value 
but in recognition of a faithful effort for regular attend-
-P-A-G-E-117
  ATTENDANCE RECORDS AND REPORTS 99) 
ance on the part of the pupil. Usually the awards are 
given by the county superintendent. Various systems 
are in use, and the teacher should communicate with 
her superintendent as to the practice in that county. 
If no awards are furnished from the office of the county 
superintendent, she can purchase them from any school 
supply house. 
Personal Inquiry.—Many teachers maintain a high 
average daily attendance for their school by a close 
“follow up” system with the parents. If a pupil is 
absent for a day the teacher in the evening either makes 
a personal call at that home or inquires of the mother 
by telephone if the child is ill. Both the parents and 
the child will be pleased to know that the teacher thinks 
enough of them to really miss the child when absent, 
and will make an effort to assist her in keeping up her 
attendance. 
Compulsory Attendance-——After all other means have 
been tried, compulsion is the only one left. Nearly 
every State in the Union has resorted to definite laws 
on compulsory attendance. These are laws which com- 
pel children of certain ages to attend school for a cer- 
tain number of weeks during the school year. While in 
attendance at the school, they are required to take 
certain branches that will prepare them for citizenship. 
There are a number of exemptions that may be applied 
in case a child really cannot attend school. The diffi- 
culty is that far too many parents are anxious to make 
use of any point that permits them to keep their chil- 
dren out of school. The penalty for such actions in 
some States is very heavy, both for parents and school 
authorities who may neglect their duties along this par- 
ticular line.
-P-A-G-E-118
  100 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
All teachers of the public schools and all school offi- 
cers are responsible for the enforcement of these laws. 
In most States theteacher—reports the truant child to 
the secretary of the school board, who in turn reports 
the matter to the president_of the school corporation, 
who must take some action. This-matter of responsi- 
bility is not the same in all States. The teacher should 
make inquiry of her county superintendent or the presi- 
dent of her board for details that she does not under- 
stand.

RECORDS AND REPORTS 
Large industries keep very careful records of all busi- 
ness transactions. They do this in order to compare 
one year’s business with another. Factories have been 
known to keep very close account of the cost of every 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
  ATTENDANCE RECORDS AND REPORTS 101 
part of a manufactured machine, even to the cost of a 
small bolt. All this is done to make it possible for a 
large concern to watch all details and to manufacture 
a satisfactory article with the least possible expense, 
and to sell it at a fair profit. Schools should also be 
placed upon a business basis. Each school should keep 
accurate and complete records. The people who pay 
for the schools have a right to know what results they 
are getting from their money. Taxpayers should know 
the enumeration of the district, the number enrolled in 
the schools, and the percentage of attendance. Such 
reports wisely made from records kept by good teachers 
constitute the business phase of the school. Teachers 
need to understand that they have a very important 
part in this phase of the school business. If one teacher 
fails to keep accurate records, her reports will neces- 
sarily be incorrect. Her neglect means, in a measure, 
failure for the whole system of school records and re- 
ports, county, State, and nation. 
Function of Records and Reports.—The primary 
function of records and reports as indicated above is to 
convey accurate information to school boards and 
patrons. The county superintendent needs complete 
and accurate reports in order to give the best super- 
vision. He can assist in program-building, in securing 
proper supplies, and in checking up on localities where 
attendance is poor if he has complete reports. He 
makes all necessary State reports from those sent in by 
his teachers. Complete records and reports are very 
essential to the success of the next teacher. She cannot 
properly classify her pupils without adequate reports. 
Much of the poor classification found in rural schools is 
caused by poorly kept records. Children are too often 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
102 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
placed in classes in which they claim membership sim- 
ply because no records are left. The teacher is com- 
pelled to take the pupil’s word for the situation and 
hope for the best. Such a condition should not exist 
in an institution that is attempting to handle the best 
product of America—boys and girls. 
Records to be Kept.—The School Register —The school 
register is a complete and permanent record showing: 
(t) Names and ages of pupils. 
(2) Record of attendance for each pupil. 
(3) The grades earned in various subjects by the 
pupils during the term. 
(4) Where classes began work at the beginning of the 
term and where they quit at the close. 
(5) Where each class should take up work for the 
new term.

The school register should be secured from the presi- 
dent or secretary of the school board, and carefully 
studied for several days before school begins in order 
that the teacher may properly organize and classify the 
school. From this record, a tentative program should 
be made. This register, if properly kept by the former 
teacher, will be one of the greatest helps in getting a 
school well organized.

  ATTENDANCE RECORDS AND REPORTS — 103 
How to Make Reports.—In chapter IV suggestions 
were made regarding neatness, promptness, and accur- 
acy in making reports. The first two ought to be easy 
for any enterprising teacher, but the last causes a great 
amount of difficulty. County superintendents declare 
that nearly all the reports that they receive from begin- 
ning teachers need correcting before they can be used 
in making final county reports. Teachers make errors 
in finding the percentage of attendance, the average 
attendance, and the average cost of tuition. 
The following paragraphs are written to help teachers 
in this very important matter. 
In practically all schools teachers are required to 
make term reports to the school board and the county 
superintendent. Some county superintendents require 
reports at different times during the year, such as a 
post-card notification of the acceptance of a school and 
the salary to be paid. This is sent in before school 
opens. A second post-card report is sent at the close 
of the first day, giving enrollment and needed supplies. 
A third report, a little more extensive, goes in at the 
close of the first week. This gives the classification of 
the school and the daily program. The fourth report is 
the term report mentioned above. There is no uni- 
formity as to form or number of reports required in the 
various States, but since term reports are in common 
use the following is given for careful study: 
The Keeping of the Attendance Record.—Many difier- 
ent plans are used by authors of school registers for 
marking absence, tardiness, and school entrance in the 
records. In some cases crosses are used for a whole 
day’s absence. In others, dots in each half-day’s space 
indicate absence for that half day. Below a plan in
-P-A-G-E-122
104 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
common use is suggested. Reference to the first pages 
of any register in use will give all information necessary: 
“EE” indicates that a pupil entered school on that day. A 
dot indicates absence. Dots in both the upper and lower 
spaces indicate absence for both forenoon and afternoon. ‘“t”’ in- 
dicates that the pupil was tardy. When a pupil is absent at 
“the opening of school, either in the forenoon or afternoon, a 
dot is placed in the proper place after his name. If he comes 
in later, the dot is changed to “‘t”, indicating that he is tardy. 
When a pupil is absent for three consecutive days he is 
dropped from school. This is indicated by a “D” written in 
the proper place. He must not then be counted absent, for he 
does not belong to school until he enters again. 
The diagram on page 105 is a sample of the record of 
attendance of a typical one-teacher rural school. 
With the above two months record it is suggested 
that the student work out the following term report. 
We will assume that the teacher receives $100 per month.

2. Average number belonging is found by dividing the 
sum of the number belonging for each day by the num- 
ber of days school has been taught. 
3. Total number of days’ attendance is found by adding 
up all days attended by all pupils. 
4. Total Absence-—In most States a pupil who is out 
of school three consecutive days after enrolling is re- 
garded as not belonging to the school and is dropped 
from the roll. In some States, however, five consecu- 
tive days are allowed. If he returns later, he is marked 
as entering. The number of days between the time of 
his being dropped from the roll until he enters again is 
known as days of non-membership. If the pupil is out 
of school three consecutive days or less, he is absent 
during that time. Therefore, total absence can be 
found by counting up all days absent where the child in 
question has been absent three days or less. 
5. Total days of non-membership are found by making 
a total of all days that any child was not a member 
after having been dropped from the roll. 
6. Average daily attendance is found by dividing the 
total number of days attended by all pupils by the num- 
ber of days school has been taught. 
7. Percentage of attendance is found by adding together 
the total attendance in days and the total absence in 
days, and dividing the total attendance in days by this 
sum. 
8. Average cost of tuition is found by dividing the 
amount paid the teacher per month by the average daily 
attendance for the term. 
Record of Standing.—Every register should contain a 
page upon which are recorded the final grades for the 
term. The grade earned by each pupil in each subject

that was pursued during the term should be given. 
Care should be exercised by the teacher in the final de- 
termination of these grades. If they are correctly and 
accurately given it will greatly assist the next teacher 
in the organization of the school. 
Classification Record.—The page which contains the 
record of the classification of the pupils is of very great 
importance to the succeeding teacher. The syllabus of 
lasses should give the new teacher just the information 
that is needed in planning for the first day’s work. 
That portion of the page dealing with the subject of 
reading is given on page 107. Other subjects in the 
course of study should be treated in the same manner. 
The numbers for the pupils are taken from the record 
of daily attendance previously given in this chapter. 
Other Features—Several other items of information 
should be included in a complete school register. A 
copy of the daily program of study and recitation should 
be given in full. A special report from the teacher to 
her successor should include suggestions and recom- 
mendations as to promotions of individual pupils or 
classes. Needs for apparatus, library books, and ma- 
terials may be mentioned. A copy of the teacher’s term 
report to the school authorities should be recorded. 
Special Records and Reports.—Report to Parents.— 
The teacher should regularly make a report of the 
pupils’ work to the parents. In many counties the 
county superintendent furnishes cards for that purpose. 
A special form for the county may have been devised. 
The teacher should consult the county superintendent 
as to the plan followed in that county. If no cards are 
furnished the teacher should ask the school board to get 
some. The report-card should be sent to the parents
-P-A-G-E-127
  ATTENDANCE RECORDS AND REPORTS 109 
once every four or six weeks. The important items to 
be included in the report are: (2) number of days at- 
tended; (6) number of times tardy; (c) deportment; 
(d) attitude toward school work; (e) character of work 
done in each subject during the period. The report 
should be simple and easily read. A place for the par- 
ents’ signature should be indicated. 
Library Record.—A good library is one of the best aids 
to a school. There are several reasons why a good 
record of the library books should be kept. First, the 
teacher needs to know just what books she has that can 
be used for reference and supplemental work in the sev- 
eral subjects. Second, the school board needs a record 
of the library books so that it may intelligently add to 
the library. Third, the county superintendent needs the 
information so that he can make proper recommenda- 
tions to the board. 
Health Record—A record of the physical examina- 
tions of each pupil may well be kept. Such a record is 
of much value to a new teacher. Cases of poor eyes, 
poor hearing, and a tendency to undernourishment 
would then be a matter of record. The following simple 
record is suggested.

CHAPTER VI 
SCHOOL BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS 
Statement of Problem.—Teachers and patrons should 
recognize the important part that physical environment 
and equipment play in the physical, mental, and moral 
development of boys and girls. The human soul ab- 
sorbs its environment. It draws inspiration from its 
surroundings. The schoolhouse and its setting should 
be an expression of the public spirit and civic pride of 
the community. It should measure the community in- 
terest and progress in education. 
Progress and Ideals.—One of the outstanding features 
in American education has been the progress made in 
schoolhouse construction and sanitation. No teacher, 
no community, need to be ignorant to-day with refer- 
ence to ideals and practical accomplishments in school 
buildings and equipment. - In spite of this fact, a large 
number of rural children must spend a large portion of 
their waking hours in schoolhouses of pioneer days that 
tend to undermine: health and lower the efficiency of 
both pupil and teacher. A study of educational needs 
and achievements from the standpoint of school archi- 
tecture should be a part of the teacher’s professional 
preparation. Not only should she have this knowledge, 
but she should also comprehend her responsibility and 
duty in developing a public sentiment that will desire 
and be satisfied only with the best. 
Good equipment is as necessary for the teacher as 
good tools and machinery are necessary for the farmer. 
113
-P-A-G-E-132
  114 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
A good workman will insist on good tools. One can 
sometimes judge a teacher by the conditions with which 
she is satisfied. Some people .are to be pitied not so 
much for what they do not have as for what they do 
not miss. The teacher has a twofold problem with 
reference to buildings and equipment: first, make the 
best use of her present situation, and second, plan for 
new or improved conditions. 
These two factors must go hand in hand. Some 
things suggested may seem impracticable and impossible. 
However, we mention only those things that a number 
of communities and teachers have found possible. A 
teacher must have a vision. “Low aim is crime.” 
Progress is dependent upon fundamental changes, and 
while these take root and grow the teacher must make the 
best of conditions as she finds them. To this end, prac- 
tical suggestions for improvement are mentioned. 
Grounds.—The modern rural school, with its program 
of play, nature study, physical training, and athletics, 
requires an adequate site. The lot should be oblong in 
shape. The building should be set well back from the 
road, and the grounds in front should have landscape 
treatment, with walks, trees, and shrubbery. The play- 
ground should be located in the rear of the building. 
Where the school is large, the primary pupils should 
have a playground of their own at the side of the build- 
ing. The teacher, however, is to make the best use of 
the land already provided. The ground should be level. 
It should be free from weeds, stones, bricks, sticks, and 
ashes. As soon as the teacher has established herself 
in the community, and her regular school work is under 
way, she should plan a clean-up day. Parents should 
be given an opportunity to co-operate.
-P-A-G-E-133
SCHOOL BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS 115 
Be sure that no ash pile is allowed to accumulate. 
Provide a special box for the ashes, or use them in build- 
ing walks or for filling. A good grass lawn should be 
built up. An attempt should be made to beautify the 
school grounds, by planting trees, shrubs, and flowers, 
following some recommended plan. Many States pub- 
lish special bulletins on the subject. It is best to fol- 
low suggestions made for your own State as far as possi- 
ble. Native trees and shrubs are more easily obtained, 
and will grow if given a chance. Pupils should watch 
plants grow and develop with increasing interest. Arbor 
day could be used for a real practical aesthetic lesson 
on every school ground. 
Do not forget that nurture as well as planting is neces- 
sary. Trees and flowers will grow if properly planted 
and given constant care. They should get plenty of 
water, and the ground should be cultivated frequently 
the first year. Sufficient interest and pride should be 
developed so that the children will see that their school 
grounds are cared for also during vacations. The school 
yard and all that grows upon it can be a silent teacher. 
There are sermons that only trees can preach, and a 
love for flowers that makes discipline and law enforce- 
ment easier. 
A good fence looks well and is an essential help in 
keeping the schoolhouse grounds in proper condition. 
The fence may be made both ornamental and useful. 
Very few school grounds have a fence. Perhaps because 
the patrons have not been led to see this need. There 
are a few board fences, but the largest number are 
made of woven wire. It would be a fine project in 
manual training to keep the fence in good repair, such 
as straight corners, tight wires, and gates properly hung.
-P-A-G-E-134
  116 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
Since a well-kept school ground is a good advertise- 
ment for the community, then a good fence should prove 
a paying investment. 
The Schoolhouse.—The rural school buildings in most 
States are either new and modern or the old “box-car”’ 
type of pioneer days. (See page 117.) There is no more 
excuse for old, inadequate, out-of-date buildings than 
there is for the old reaper or ox-cart. 
What is an up-to-date rural school building? A plant 
adequate to its task and appropriate to its purpose. 
In outward appearance the one-room schoolhouse 
should be one of beauty and dignity. (See frontispiece.) 
It should be carefully planned and carefully built. The 
outside door should open into a hall. From this hall 
there should be a door leading to a boys’ cloak-room and 
one leading to the girls’ cloak-room. These cloak-rooms 
should be so built that the teacher can supervise them. 
A dark, out of the way cloak-room is not conducive to 
good discipline. The main building ‘should have a 
twelve-foot ceiling. The main schoolroom should pro- 
vide eighteen square feet of floor space per pupil. There 
should be a special room for the library and supplies. 
Indoor toilets should be placed on the first floor. The 
building should stand on a high foundation, making 
possible a light and dry basement. Besides the regular 
furnace-room there should be a room for domestic sci- 
ence and the school lunch, a room for boys in manual 
training, a large room that could be used for a play- 
room and a meeting-room for community entertain- 
ments. It is recommended that a coal-room be built 
outside the main basement. The building should, of 
course, be properly lighted, heated, and ventilated. In 
many places the old building might be remodelled and
-P-A-G-E-135
SCHOOL BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS 117 
a basement provided so as to meet the requirements 
above. Study the following floor plan. The working 
out of a model school building and grounds will make a 
splendid class project. A number of school architects 
and superintendénts are coming to favor a building 
  
    
  A BOX-CAR TYPE OF SCHOOL 
without a basement. This plan has many points in 
its favor, and merits careful study. 
The fundamental problem for the teacher in any 
school, but especially in a modern up-to-date school- 
house, is to see that the building is kept up and all the 
good features utilized. So many buildings tell a sad 
story of neglect and procrastination. To have and not 
to use, whether through ignorance or carelessness, is 
evidence of serious incompetency. Care for public 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
118 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
property is good training in citizenship. Let your 
school property be an object lesson in this respect. 
The Old Type Building.—Unfortunately, this modern 
rural school building is the exception, not the rule. 
Reasons for this backwardness are natural, but not always 
justifiable. The more important factors are: 
(1) A decreasing school enrollment. 
(2) Easier to repair the old building. 
(3) Lack of educational leadership and therefore no 
public sentiment for better things. 
(4) Many leading farmers who now have no children 
in the school. 
(5) A growing conviction that the one-teacher school 
is soon to be replaced by the consolidated type. 
(6) Too many ‘‘suit-case” teachers, whose real in- 
terest is not in the country school. 
(7) The large number who stay but one year in the 
same district. 
(8) Tenantry. 
(9) Directors and patrons do not realize the value of 
the new building over the old. 
(ro) A financial depression and unrest among farmers 
in some communities. 
In view of the fact that so many teachers will have 
to work in “the old schoolhouse,” it is important that 
they know what to do under those circumstances. If 
the old building is almost hopeless and a decided menace 
to health, and especially if consolidation seems some- 
what remote, the teacher should seek to obtain only 
the most urgent repairs and start a definite campaign 
for a new building. The people should understand, of 
course, that a new building may put off consolidation 
for a time, but will not be a permanent substitute for 
it. In time, natural evolution must have its way.

The Old Building Made Usable.—Ii the old building 
must be used for a few years, what can be done with it? _ 
Make it just as comfortable for the children and as 
conducive to good school work as possible. Here are a 
few practical suggestions: 
(a) For the teacher: 
1. Secure window boards for ventilation of school- 
room. 
2. See that air in room is properly humidified, es- 
pecially during winter. This can be done by placing a 
pan or pail of water on the stove. 
3. Interest the school board in placing a jacket 
around the stove that the room may be heated prop- 
erly. 
4. Purchase a jar with faucet and cover for drinking- 
water. 
5. Fit up a cozy corner with looking-glass, wash dish, 
individual combs, drinking-cups, and towels. 
6. Have the manual training class build a shelf for 
dinner pails and a rack for overshoes and rubbers. 
7. Secure new adjustable window shades. 
8. Remove stove from the center of the room and 
place it in the corner with a jacket around it. 
9. Have seats placed properly as indicated on pages 
120-131. 
io. Provide a mat for exhibiting work. 
Many of the points suggested the teacher cannot se- 
cure without money. If the school board says that it 
cannot furnish the money, the teacher may need to give 
an entertainment or social for that purpose. The teacher 
will need to interest the community in helping to do 
many of these things. This can be done during a general 
clean-up campaign.
-P-A-G-E-139
  \ 
SCHOOL BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS 121 
(6) For the school board: 
1. If the building is in fair condition, it can be raised 
and a good foundation and basement put in. This will 
give more room and a satisfactory system of heat and 
ventilation. 
2. Put a good tight foundation under the building. 
The directors should see that saving in fuel alone will 
pay for this improvement. 
3. A new hardwood floor can be laid on top of the 
old one. 
4. A chimney of adequate size can be built, and an 
adequate heating and ventilating plant installed. 
5. A good coat of paint both inside and outside will help 
to make the building attractive and usable. A pleasing 
color scheme is a fine disciplinarian. It pays to paint. 
6. In many old buildings, the windows and doors are 
out of repair. In many cases the windows should be 
rearranged and new ones added. 
7. Many old buildings need a separate cloak-room for 
boys and girls. 
8. A good porch or vestibule will sometimes do a 
great deal to make an old building more serviceable. 
9. Build a fuel-room at the rear of the building. 
The teacher must use her own judgment in deciding 
the improvement most needed and the one to ask for 
first. To figure the necessary lumber and other ma- 
terials needed should make a very interesting project 
for a class in arithmetic. 
The interest and co-operation of the pupils are neces- 
sary in order to get much needed repairs and improve- 
ment. Public sentiment and pride need to be devel- 
oped.’ The teacher must have a good stock of tact, 
persistence, and resourcefulness in order to get action.
-P-A-G-E-140
122 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
The teacher should remember, of course, that she is 
looked upon as an outsider. Her task will be to get 
the people in the community to take the initiative. The 
taxpayer should realize the importance of good build- 
ings and equipment from the standpoint of morality, 
health, mental achievement, discipline, and citizenship. 
The people should see that they are losing money by 
not having these material things. ‘There is a with- 
holding that leadeth to poverty.” A condition that 
makes a $100 teacher only 50% efficient and makes 
children lose much valuable time shows poor business 
sense. The State should help by encouraging some com- 
munities and compelling others to do the right thing. 
Do not forget that in the school of to-day is the State 
of to-morrow. 
Heat and Veniilation——This is. a problem that the 
teacher must thoroughly understand. Practically all 
new buildings are properly equipped in this respect. 
The teacher’s problem is that of understanding the sys- 
tem and operating it successfully. Study the printed 
instructions that come with the plant. The general 
principle of ventilation should be understood. Country 
schools have what is known as the gravity system. 
Large schools can have a fan and force the air into the 
rooms. The gravity system depends upon currents of 
air set in motion by means of heat. There must be a 
fresh-air intake and a foul-air outlet. 
In a hot-air furnace, the air from the outside is con- 
ducted through a large pipe or duct to an enclosure 
around the firebox. The air, when heated, passes up 
through other ducts and enters the room at a point 
about eight feet above the floor. The foul and cold air 
is drawn out through a duct at the floor on the same wall 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
SCHOOL BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS 123 
as the inlet. The air must now make a complete cir- 
cuit of the room before it is discharged. The teacher 
should learn to operate the furnace and see that the 
air ducts are kept open. If the furnace does not prop- 
erly heat and ventilate the building it will be due to 
one or more of the following causes: 
(r) Poor circulation of air. 
(2) Chimney full of soot. 
(3) Improper installation. 
(4) Furnace too small for the building, or an improp- 
erly built chimney. 
(5) Dampers in the pipes not operated properly. 
(6) Air too dry. 
Many furnaces, however, are not installed as stated 
above. A large number have registers in the floors for 
both incoming and outgoing air. It takes no imagina- 
tion to see that these floor registers are nothing but 
dust and dirt catchers and that the system rotates dust- 
laden air. The teacher should prevent children from 
standing and scraping their feet on the register, and 
keep the air duct as clean as possible. Some systems 
have inadequate fresh-air intakes and recirculate the 
air in the building. There are even a few buildings 
with foul-air register near the ceiling. This system just 
wastes heat. Some have the foul-air register on the 
opposite wall from the fresh-air register. The best 
way to remove foul air is by the use of a double-flue 
chimney, or by means of a steel jacket inside the chim- 
ney. In the first plan the chimney is made with two 
compartments, one for smoke, the other for foul air, 
with a register in the floor opening into the schoolroom. 
The compartments are separated by a wall made of one 
thickness of brick. When a fire is built the heated 
   
-P-A-G-E-142
124 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
smoke in the smoke compartment heats the brick, and in 
turn the foul-air chamber is heated. Currents of air 
rise in the foul-air chamber, which tends to draw foul 
air through the register. The second calls for a steel flue 
on the inside of the chimney. Not a few room-heaters 
have the fresh-air duct open under the stove. This is not 
satisfactory, as it takes too long for the air to be heated 
and circulation started. This can be remedied by 
bringing the fresh-air duct through the wall and the 
jacket at a height where the cold air will strike the 
hottest part of the stove. (See page 125.) Books and 
bulletins that. go into detail on this subject should be 
studied. See list of references at the end of this chapter. 
Room-Heater—Many new buildings are heated and 
ventilated by means of a jacketed stove in the school- 
room. This system has some advantages over the 
furnace. It is easier to operate and more accessible, 
and for that reason not so easily neglected by the teach- 
ers. The stove and chimney should be placed in the 
same end of the room. The fresh-air intake must be 
kept open all day. There should be a register at the 
floor leading into the foul-air duct. The so-called pat- 
ented system provides for the mixing of smoke and foul 
air. In this case the foul-air duct should come down 
to about six inches from the floor. (See illustration.) 
All heating plants require intelligent operation and 
watchfulness. The writer has visited a large number of 
schools where the fresh-air duct was kept shut. In some 
instances, cardboard was nailed over the fresh-air intake. 
Sometimes a box is placed in front of the register in the 
chimney. The stove or furnace requires some care. 
The grates must be kept free of ashes. Special care must 
be taken to regulate the heat. The teacher should in-

sist upon having a good thermometer. The room 
should be 68 degrees, never over 70 degrees, by nine 
o’clock, and kept as close to that temperature through- 
out the day as possible. There is no excuse for great 
variation from the normal temperature. All rooms in 
the building should be heated and ventilated. 
In an old schoolhouse, the teacher often has no ven- 
tilating system at all, or one improperly installed. The 
district should be urged to put in a proper system. In 
the meanwhile, the teacher must ventilate by means of 
windows. Even with a ventilating system, it is good 
practice to flush the rooms thoroughly with fresh air at 
intermissions. Keep children away from drafts. In a 
recent investigation of this problem in a New York 
school, a committee recommended the window method 
of ventilation as satisfactory. They object to the me- 
chanical system because of the uniformity of the air 
and tendency to overheating. There is no question but 
that avoidance of overheating is the prime essential of all 
systems of ventilation. The most important article of 
ventilation equipment is the thermometer. Use it. 
Drafts of cold air may be prevented from striking the 
pupils by opening the windows at the top, or by use of 
window-boards. Window-boards are made by cutting 
any width of board to fit inside the window-sash. 
Place this board underneath the raised window. In- 
direct currents of air will come in between the sash at 
the top and prevent direct drafts upon children. Frames 
covered with cheese-cloth could be made to fit inside 
the window-casing. 
Humidity—This is a more important factor than 
most people realize. The air in too many of our houses 
and school buildings is too dry. Medical authorities
-P-A-G-E-145
  SCHOOL BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS 127 
tell us that this condition is the cause of much throat 
trouble and other ailments. In every room there should 
be some means for adding moisture to the heated air. 
Secure as large an evaporating surface of water as pos- 
sible. On ordinary stoves a large open pan can be 
used. If you have a jacketed stove a pan can be hung 
inside on the jacket. The furnace has a pan near the 
fire-box. These so-called humidifiers are not always 
adequate, and make it necessary for us to place extra 
pans on registers or on the stove. Constant attention 
is required here, and pans or humidifiers must frequently 
be supplied with water. 
Lighting—We are coming more and more to appre- 
ciate the wonderful power of sunlight in purifying the 
air. The teacher should appreciate this natural agent 
and control it in her schoolroom as much as possible. 
The importance of proper light cannot be overesti- 
mated. The number of rural children who suffer from 
defective eyesight is appalling. The school should try 
to remedy rather than to aggravate this physical defect. 
One need but look at a modern factory to see what im- 
portance some business men attach to adequate light. 
We should do no less for our children who are compelled 
to go to school than we do for the working-man. Two 
things are quite well established with reference to light 
in a schoolroom: first, the glass area should be one- 
fifth of the floor area, and second, all windows should 
be placed to the left of the pupils as they are seated. 
Practically all new buildings are properly lighted. This 
is decidedly not so with old buildings. The teacher’s 
problem is again that of making the best of a difficult 
situation. The better plan, of course, would be to get 
the board to rearrange the windows and provide ade- 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
    128 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
quate light. The teacher should make a serious at- 
tempt to get as much light as possible. Next to getting 
more windows and having them properly placed in the 
schoolroom, or while she is waiting for this improvement, 
the teacher can improve conditions in many ways. The 
following are suggestive of what can be accomplished: 
(1) Keep window-glass clean. 
(2) Keep windows free from school exhibits, drawings, 
daisy chains, and the like that obstruct the light. 
(3) Use only sash curtains of light material, and keep 
them clean. 
(4) Proper adjustment of shades, especially receiving as 
much light as possible from the upper part of the window. 
(5) Trees trimmed. 
Shades.—It is fully as important to know how to 
control the light as to have the right amount of glass 
area. The teacher has a responsibility here that she 
should fully realize. Good shades in proper working 
order should be insisted upon. ‘This is especially true 
in buildings where the light is inadequate at best. 
Dark opaque shades must not be tolerated. Use only 
translucent shades. The best colors are: light tan, light 
gray, cream, light olive-green. The shades should har- 
monize with the walls. 
The old practice of hanging stationary shades from 
the top should be discouraged. Adjustable’ shades are 
practical and within the reach of every school. There 
is no practice more harmful than to keep some of the 
shades down all the time because they are out of repair 
and will not roll. Better to remove them from the win- 
dows altogether and permit the children to move about 
to keep out of direct sunlight. The teacher should study 
the effect of proper light upon the blackboards, and
-P-A-G-E-147
  SCHOOL BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS , 129 
should always be on the alert to keep the best light con- 
ditions before the pupils, and herself, all the time. 
It is not out of place here to suggest that the teacher’s 
carelessness in handling shades often destroys their use- 
fulness. Do not let-pupils play with the shades. Do 
  
    
PROPER LIGHTING 
not pull them down too far nor allow them to run up 
quickly. 
The accompanying cut will show how pupils should 
be seated and light controlled. In another chapter the 
effect of proper light and seating upon school work and 
discipline is discussed. 
Seating.—The next important problem for the teacher 
is to see that all the pupils are properly seated. This 
problem is of special importance in rural schools where 
the children must, of necessity, spend much of the time 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
130 , RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
at their desks. Round shoulders, spinal curvature, and 
other physical ailments may be traced to improper seat- 
ing. A child who is not physically comfortable at his 
desk is hard to discipline and incapable of the best in- 
tellectual effort. 
The double desks of pioneer days should now be a 
thing of the past. They should no longer be tolerated. 
Only single adjustable desks should be used. The 
most serious problem a teacher faces is where new desks 
have been purchased but most of them are either too 
large or too small. The director cannot see why the 
desks are not all right: “They are almost new.”” Rural 
schools that do not use adjustable desks should have a 
number of extra sizes on hand. At any rate, the chil- 
dren of to-day should not suffer because of the mistakes 
or poor judgment of the directors in the past. As far 
as possible, every desk should be fitted to the pupil who 
is to occupy it. Where a desk is so large that a child’s 
feet do not reach the floor, a box or foot rest should be 
placed under the desk. This seems so simple and yet 
it is so common to find schools where one or more chil- 
dren have to sit with feet hanging in the air. 
Another common mistake is to find the desks arranged 
with all the small desks in front of the room, and then 
the next size, and so on. This means that a child sits 
on one size seat and reads on a desk smaller in size. No 
child can hope to fit such a combination. The teacher 
who is confronted with this problem should get a director 
or some of the older boys to help her rearrange the desks 
at once. 
Perhaps a more common mistake is that of placing 
the desks too far apart. This can be remedied as sug- 
gested above. The proper distance apart may be ob-
-P-A-G-E-149
  SCHOOL BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS 131 
tained approximately by placing the desks so that desk 
and front edge of the seat, when lowered, overlap two 
  
  AN IMPROPER SEAT ARRANGEMENT 
and one-half inches. For a more accurate adjustment, 
the following is recommended: 
Desks Nos. 6 and 5, nine inches from edge of desk to 
back of seat. 
Desks No. 4, ten inches. 
Desks No. 3, eleven inches. 
Desks No. 2, twelve inches. 
Sizes of Desks.—If stationary desks are used, they 
should be of five sizes, as follows: 
No. 6, very small. For five, six, and seven year old 
children (Grades 1 and 2). No. 5 are for eight and 
nine year olds (Grades 2 and 3). No. 4 are for ten and  
-P-A-G-E-150
  132 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
eleven year olds (Grades 3, 4, 5). No. 3 are for twelve 
and thirteen year olds (Grades 4, 5, 6). No. 2 are for 
fourteen and upward (Grades 7 and 8). 
Adjustable Desks.—There is perhaps no place where 
adjustable desks are so desirable as in a rural school. 
There seems to be a greater variation in size of children, 
and a more frequent change in the school population. 
With adjustable desks, the proper adjustment can be 
made at any time. 
A new type of adjustable desk or movable chair has 
come to be quite popular and desirable also for rural 
schools. It consists of a chair with a writing-table or 
desk attached; as this chair is not fastened to the floor, 
the room can easily be arranged for community meet- 
ings, indoor play, or games. Where the stationary 
desks are used, it is advantageous to have them fastened 
to strips. Three desks in a group are quite satisfactory. 
Proper pride in a neat, clean, orderly desk should be 
cultivated. It is not enough that the desks fit the 
pupils; they should be kept in a neat, hygienic, and 
sanitary condition. 
Blackboards.—Our new spirit in education placing in- 
creasing emphasis upon pupil activity and less upon 
formal book work, demands more and better blackboards 
in our school. The average rural schoolroom should 
have one hundred square feet of blackboard. Slate is 
permanent and more satisfactory than any other kind. 
Composition blackboards will in time lose their surface 
and need to be replaced or painted. Only special black- 
board paint should be used. The common width of 
blackboards is forty-two inches. 
It is important that blackboards are properly placed 
on the wall. Remember that six and sixteen-year-old
-P-A-G-E-151
    
  
  INTERIOR OF MODERN BUILDING LOOKING SOUTHWEST 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
134 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
pupils use the same room. Twenty-six inches from the 
floor is about the proper distance for primary children. 
Blackboards should be kept clean and free from chalk 
dust. Use little, if any, of the board space for exhibits. 
A strip or tan of green burlap just above the blackboard 
is excellent for this purpose. Study the various ways in 
which blackboards may aid in instruction. Avoid eye- 
strain in reading blackboard work.

CHAPTER VII 
RURAL SCHOOL EQUIPMENT 
To appreciate the importance of general equipment 
one must understand the present viewpoint in American 
education. One must see in it a spirit of purposeful 
activity on the part of pupils, a spirit of industry, and 
a spirit of seeking after truth. Present-day education 
seeks facts from all possible sources and trains the child 
to properly use and evaluate them. The project method, 
the sociological recitation, and group activity demand 
more than pupil and text-book. Again, the school feels 
responsible for health, education, and the development 
of morals. All this demands equipment and materials 
not common in the old school. 
EQUIPMENT FOR INSTRUCTION 
Maps and Globes.—The school must be equipped with 
a good set of suitable maps. The necessary maps in a 
special case can be purchased from any reliable com- 
pany. It might be well to caution directors to be sure 
to get up-to-date maps. The State map often comes in 
a separate case. It is necessary that maps be placed 
in a proper and convenient place on the wall. 
The globe should be eighteen inches in diameter and 
be suspended from the ceiling. 
Sand Table—A sand table is now a part of the regular 
equipment in primary rooms. This table need not be 
very expensive, and if necessary can be made by the 
older boys in school. The following dimensions are rec- 
139
-P-A-G-E-158

ommended: Length, fifty inches. Height, twenty-five 
inches. Width, thirty inches. Box five inches deep. 
The picture on this page is a good example of a sand 
table that was made from an old desk, formerly used by 
the teacher. The legs were cut off to make it the proper 
height. Boards were nailed around the edge of the

table-top. Oilcloth lining was used to prevent the sand 
from sifting through cracks and openings. 
Boxes about the size of the pupil’s desk would ade- 
quately serve the purpose. These could be stored away 
in a small space when not in use. 
Seat Work Material.—This topic is of vital importance 
in a rural school. At best pupils spend much time 
alone. A good supply of materials will help the teacher 
to arrange seat work and make it profitable. An aver-
-P-A-G-E-159

age school should have on hand at least ten dollars’ 
worth of material for primary work. Each teacher 
should make out a list of needed material and give it to 
the director at the opening of the term. Make it clear 
to the board that the material is for educative seat work 
and is just as necessary as books and paper. The fol- 
lowing suggested list of supplies has been prepared by 
trained, experienced rural teachers and indicates the 
minimum materials for one year’s supply for twelve 
pupils.

HECTOGRAPH RECIPE 
I2 ounces water. 
24 ounces glycerine 
2 ounces glue—white. 
xz oblong pan, 12 inches by 714 inches and 1% inches deep. 
Heat water and white glue in a double boiler and keep on fire 
until melted. Add glycerine and boil one minute—mix thor- 
oughly and pour the whole mixture into the pan. 
While pouring, hold the boiler in which mixture has been 
cooked as close to oblong pan as:possile, in order to avoid forma- 
tion of air-bubbles. If bubbles rise to surface after pan has been 
set on level to harden, take ruler or stiff cardboard with straight 
edge and skim surface of hectograph as bubbles rise, in order to 
leave smooth when it hardens. Leave pan on level for eight hours. 
To make first copy use regular hectograph ink (violet) and 
draw designs or write inscription on smooth paper. Let ink get 
fairly dry before placing on surface of hectograph. Place copy 
face downward on hectograph surface and press every part of 
the paper gently with soft cloth. Then allow to remain on 
from three to five minutes. Remove and make copies one at a 
time on common print paper.

After having made desired number of copies sponge surface 
with warm water to remove all traces of ink. Blot with paper 
and let hectograph stand for eight hours. 
RECIPE FOR PASTE

Add salt to boiling water and stir flour and cornstarch (mixed 
with a little cold water) into water and let boil until clear. Then 
cool. Knead. Dry in air—use water afterward to soften. 
Can use again as clay.   
Text-books.—This is one of the most fundamental con- 
siderations in school equipment. The old school, with 
its three R’s, demanded very little. It is different now. 
So much time is wasted in some schools because of the 
inadequate supply of text-books. The new teacher will 
do well to find out what books are needed and have them 
ordered in ample time. Most county superintendents 
will have a county list, from which the teacher may 
select her supply. A study of different texts should be 
a part of regular methods courses. A good text is up- 
to-date, follows a recognized method of procedure, is 
well written, well bound, and attractive in appearance. *° 
With added emphasis upon reading, there is a greater
-P-A-G-E-162
  144 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
necessity for supplementary readers. There should be 
at least three sets of supplementary readers for each 
grade. Thus, for example, the pupils in the third grade 
should have their regular basic readers and at least three 
different books of third-grade material for each member 
of the class. . These supplementary readers are not gen- 
erally looked upon as text-books, and can therefore be 
purchased by the board in any district. Some teachers 
may find it necessary to obtain money for supplemen- 
tary reading material by means of entertainments. 
Reference Books—The new aim and method of in- 
struction requires a great deal of outside material. The 
text is now only one source of information. No school 
is properly equipped unless it has some good reference 
material. Study the list required for each subject and 
special activities in school. All schools should have one 
large unabridged dictionary and at least five small ones. 
A good encyclopedia is useful. However, get other 
reference work first. Get special reference works on 
special subjects, such as rural health, recreation, sanita- 
tion. A number of excellent bulletins may be had for 
the asking. The more important ones are published by 
the United States Bureau of Education, State Depart- 
ment of Education, colleges of agriculture, and teachers’ 
colleges and universities. 
Equipment for Community Meetings.—It is now an ac- 
cepted fact that rural schools must develop community 
or neighborhood centers. The school should provide the 
necessary equipment. Funds for this purpose may 
properly be raised by the community itself. The more 
necessary equipment needed are folding chairs, stove 
and dishes for lunches, platform or stage that can be 
taken down, a phonograph, and song-books. Gasoline    
   
     
        
-P-A-G-E-163
RURAL SCHOOL EQUIPMENT 145 
pressure lamps or common wall lamps should be pro- 
vided. 
Fine Arts—The teacher should make a special study 
of the part that fine arts play in our scheme of education. 
Rural children need a trained intelligence and apprecia- 
tion as a basis for selecting and enjoying the beautful 
and artistic. Intelligent consumers should be our aim. 
Materials for drawing, art work, picture study, and 
music should be provided. 
Commercial Exhibits —Illustrated lessons are impor- 
tant in our new method of teaching. Any material that 
will help make lessons more attractive and hold interest 
is always welcomed by the teacher who plans her work. 
Much material may be had free. Requests can be sent 
to railroad companies, steamship lines, State immigration 
officers, and to commercial firms, such as Hershey Choc- 
olate Company, Hershey, Pa.; Pillsbury Flour Mills, 
Minneapolis, Minn.; and Esterbrook Steei Pen Manu- 
facturing Company, Camden, N. J. The teacher would 
do well to keep a special folder for clippings, mag- 
azine articles, pictures, and bulletins on special sub- 
jects. 
Industrial Work.—A rural curriculum should provide 
whenever possible for elementary domestic science, agri- 
culture, and manual training. These subjects have come 
into the curriculum because of the demand of the world 
outside the school. The equipment for these subjects 
need not be elaborate. In fact, it should be as simple 
and practical as possible. Purchase just what is needed 
and no more. The equipment for domestic ‘science 
should be of service for farmers’ club meetings and social 
gatherings, as well as for serving the hot lunch. 
The following equipment would be desirable. It need

ties and add to these as demands arise.

The equipment for agriculture is the most plentiful 
and least expensive. Soils, plants, animals, field crops, 
and poultry, with all their various problems, are on every 
hand. About the only equipment needed is mouse and 
-moth proof cupboard room for supplies and specimens. 
The equipment for manual training will depend upon 
the following factors: 
(a) Number of pupils that will be taking it. 
(6) Amount of room available.

The following equipment is made up for five pupils. 
The knives and rulers should be owned by the pupils. 
If only a limited equipment may be had, pupils should 
be induced to buy their own coping saws as well.

EQUIPMENT FOR HEALTH AND SANITATION 
Rural Needs.—Ours is an age when health and sanita- 
tion are emphasized. Investigations demonstrate the 
fact that our rural schools have not kept pace with other 
schools in the matter of equipment and provision for 
health. A new knowledge, a new vision and determi- 
nation are required to bring the rural schools up to 
standard. 
Toilets—The question of proper toilets for rural 
schools is one that should receive most serious con- 
sideration. There are even to-day too many outdoor 
toilets that are places of filth and moral degradation. 
From the standpoint of health and morals, not to men- 
tion common decency, a serious attempt must be made 
to provide clean and sanitary toilets. Even with the 
best possible toilets, a most rigid supervision is required 
to prevent them from becoming unsanitary and loath- 
some. The same standard of cleanliness should prevail 
here as in the schoolroom. 
Sufficient progress and improvements have now been 
made with respect to indoor chemical toilets, so that 
they are practical and should be installed in every
-P-A-G-E-167
  RURAL SCHOOL EQUIPMENT 149 
rural school. There are a number of firms who handle 
these toilets and can install them properly. Just where 
the toilets are to be placed will depend upon the build- 
ing. In some cases an addition to the present building 
will have to be made. Often an old building is raised 
and a full basement is put in. In this case special rooms 
  
    
SANITARY INDOOR TOILETS 
for indoor toilets can easily be provided. (See cut of 
rural building plans.) 
While indoor toilets can be installed, it is safe to pre- 
dict that for years to come a majority of our rural schools 
will have outdoor toilets. It will therefore be necessary 
for the teacher to know how to handle this problem. 
The following factors are essential: 
1. Location.—There should be two separate buildings 
located at least fifty feet apart. They should not face 
toward each other. The common practice is to locate 
them at the rear of the schoolhouse and at opposite cor-
-P-A-G-E-168
  150 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
ners of the school lot. Under no condition should the 
two toilets be under the same roof. 
2. Privacy.—The entrance should be kept from view 
by means of screen or lattice work. A very satisfactory 
appearance will result if this screen is covered with vines. 
3. Buildings ——The building must be in good repair. 
- ‘ It must be lighted and ventilated. The door must be 
kept in working order and some device provided to close 
it automatically. The windows should be screened. 
One of the chief aims is to shut out flies, which spread 
contagious disease. The boys’ toilet should have a urinal. 
4. Cleanliness—The same standard should prevail as 
for the schoolroom. Cleaning the schoolhouse should 
include the outbuildings. It is especially important that 
the walls be kept free from objectionable language and 
pictures. Much can be accomplished here if the teacher 
can develop the right spirit of co-operation and pride in 
a clean school among the pupils. 
Water Supply.—Few teachers realize the importance 
of drinking water and a sanitary method of supplying 
it. A good supply of fresh water should be available at 
“all times. The teacher should insist upon a satisfactory 
solution of this problem. 
The best source of water is a driven or drilled well on 
the school ground. No surface or dug well is safe. The 
well should be protected from surface drainage. 
A Few Schools Have Cisterns.—This is a good thing as 
a source of water for cleaning, watering plants, etc., but 
it is not satisfactory for drinking purposes, as it is prac- 
tically impossible to keep the water clean and fresh. 
A too common way of providing drinking water is by 
carrying it from the neighboring farm home. In this 
case, the teacher should satisfy herself that the water is 
 
-P-A-G-E-169
  RURAL SCHOOL EQUIPMENT 151 
pure. The directors should be led to understand that 
it is their duty to see that water is supplied. 
Fully as important as the source of the water supply 
is the sanitary way in which the children drink it. We 
have passed through the following stages of develop- 
ment: (a) The pail and common dipper. (0) Water- 
jars. (c) Individual drinking-cups. (d) Bubbler foun- 
tain. It is possible now for every rural school to have 
bubbler fountains. The teacher should note carefully 
the following: 
(a) Keep the fountain clean. 
(6) Keep it properly adjusted. 
(c) Keep it from freezing. 
(d) Keep it filled with water. 
When individual drinking cups must be used, con- 
sider the following: 
(a) How to keep cups clean, sanitary, free from dust. 
(6) How to keep them individual. 
(c) How to keep water fresh and clean. 
The practice of each child bringing a bottle of milk 
will somewhat compensate for an inadequate water sup- 
ply. 
For General Sanitation—(a) A convenient place 
should be provided where children can wash their hands. 
Liquid soap and paper or individual towels are necessary 
equipment. 
(6) Sweeping compound should be used. Keep the 
compound where the oil will not evaporate. 
(c) As far as possible, cloak-rooms should be heated 
and ventilated. Keep all wraps off the floor. Each 
child should have his own hook, with name or number 
attached. 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
152 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
(d) A special cupboard or shelf should be provided 
for the lunch-boxes. They should not be left scattered 
about the building or in cold halls. 
(e) Foot-scrapers and a cocoa mat are very necessary 
and will help materially in keeping the building clean. 
Good School Houisekeeping.—Doctor Thorndike tells us 
that the task of the school is to make changes in human 
beings; to modify human conduct. In short, the devel- 
opment of character is the task of the school. Environ- 
ment plays so important a part in character growth that 
there can be no greater motive for good school house- 
keeping. It is a sad situation when pupils and teacher 
seem to feel at home in a dirty and disorderly school- 
house. Let this matter become a reality: “A place for 
everything and everything in its place.” Orderliness 
and cleanliness and beauty are vital factors in good 
housekeeping. The floor should be scrubbed at least 
once each month and kept clean by the proper use of 
sweeping compound in the daily sweeping. 
Beautifying the School—To feel at home with the 
beautiful is a priceless characteristic. The school should 
foster this trait. Remember ‘“‘the human soul absorbs 
its environment.” An artistic atmosphere should be 
every teacher’s goal. 
The schoolroom may be beautified in the following 
manner: The walls and ceilings should be painted. The 
ceiling should be lighter than the walls. While a num- 
ber of color combinations are proper, the common prac- 
tice is to paint the ceiling a cream color and the walls 
tan. 
Shades in proper color and properly adjusted and kept 
in good repair add to the attractiveness of the room. 
Clean and well-kept desks are likewise important. A 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
  RURAL SCHOOL EQUIPMENT 153 
few good pictures appropriately framed will play no lit- 
tle part in the education of boys and girls 
Care and judgment in the display of school work are 
essential. It is so easy to overdo here and forget to take 
displays and posters down when they become old, soiled, 
and out of shape. Flowers and window-boxes always 
add to the attractiveness of the room. 
So much can be accomplished by the teacher if she 
has some idea of harmony and proper proportion, A 
talented teacher can do a great deal with blackboard 
decoration and posters. The intelligent co-operation of 
pupils should always be secured. Here, as elsewhere, it 
is the spirit that quickens.

CHAPTER VIII 
PLANNING FOR THE FIRST DAY 
Importance of the First Day.—A good beginning is of 
importance in making any kind of work a success. 
This is especially true in teaching, because so much de- 
pends upon the success of the first day. The pupils 
come expectant and watchful, ready to give attention 
to anything that may be suggested by the new teacher, 
but ever on the alert for any signs of weakness. The 
impressions made on this day remain with the boys and 
girls until they reach home, and then the most discussed 
individual of the community is the new teacher. Many 
questions of importance must be decided on this begin- 
ning day. These questions cannot be deferred or left 
for some one else to decide. The teacher must decide 
them. She must organize classes, assign lessons, pre- 
pare educative seat work, and work out a tentative 
program for the first day. If this teacher has made 
adequate preparation along the lines that will follow, 
the first day ought not to be dreaded, but will be the 
culmination of a well-planned piece of work. 
Duties BEFORE THE First Day 
Survey the Field—When a railroad corporation begins 
to consider the building of a new road it sends out a 
group of surveyors. These surveyors make a careful 
study of all conditions in order that the company may 
have definite information on all necessary curves, cuts, 
fills, bridges, and grades along the proposed right of 
156 
'
-P-A-G-E-175
  PLANNING FOR THE FIRST DAY 157 
way. ‘The teacher in a sense must assume the position 
of a surveyor before beginning her school in order to dis- 
cover the attitude of the people. The school records 
and recommendation of the former teacher, the needs 
of the school, and a boarding-place must be investigated. 
Mere investigation is hardly sufficient. The wise teacher 
will plan every movement for the day before she comes 
to her job. No detail is so unimportant that it may be 
omitted. If a teacher is wise enough to make such a 
study before her school begins, she has at least done 
what a wise builder ought to do, and her success is 
almost assured. 
Discover Public Attitudes.—A thorough knowledge of 
public sentiment is necessary in order that a teacher 
may more nearly meet the situations that may arise. 
The educational resources and ideals, the church and 
the religious standards of the neighborhood should be 
known. The environment of the pupils outside as well 
as within the homes should be studied. The attitude of 
the people toward improvement should be learned. 
The nationality of the people and their moral standards 
should be investigated. The teacher should get in 
touch with the school officers, and if possible visit the 
schoolhouse and grounds before planning her work. 
The teacher who will thus investigate, even in a small 
way, the sentiments and attitudes of the neighborhood 
into which she is going will be saved many difficulties 
when she attempts to organize and manage her school. 
Secure Boarding-Place.—It is assumed at the outset 
that the teacher expects to live where she works. With 
this thought in mind, a place to live in is the first con- 
sideration. But two questions immediately confront 
her:
-P-A-G-E-176
  158 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
1. Can a boarding-place be found ? 
2. What are the characteristics of a good boarding- 
place? 
The first of these problems usually comes up because 
of two personalities involved: the teacher and the land- 
lady. Sometimes teachers thoughtlessly demand too 
much attention. This causes those who board the 
teacher to close their doors. Again, landladies may not 
be willing to open their homes, because they do not 
care to be bothered. However, both individuals must 
remember that co-operation and the spirit of fellowship 
and good-will need to be practised here as elsewhere. 
Teachers cannot live in the country where they work 
unless they are provided with living quarters. On the 
other hand, patrons of schools must not criticise the 
teacher for boarding outside the community if they do 
not assist in this important matter of securing a good 
boarding-place. 
A teacher must use care in selecting this boasting 
place from the standpoint of neighborhood and family 
relations. Many times the teacher innocently gets into 
the wrong environment through lack of tactful inquiry 
- before making a decision. 
What are the characteristics of a good boarding-place ? 
1. If possible, a home in which no school children 
reside. 
2. One that provides a comfortable room for the 
teacher: 
(a) Properly heated. 
(b) Well lighted (for reading purposes). 
(c) Quiet. 
3. Good, wholesome food. 
4. A place in which the teacher feels at home.
-P-A-G-E-177
     PLANNING FOR THE FIRST DAY 159 
5. People who have a good reputation in the neigh- 
borhood. 
Visit Schoolhouse.—The teacher should visit the school 
building and grounds if possible before the first day. 
To be sure of a good beginning the outbuildings should be 
clean, in good repair, and in a sanitary condition. The 
weeds, ash piles, and general rubbish about the school 
yard should be removed, trees trimmed, and fences put 
in good condition The interior of the building should 
be in readiness. It should be thoroughly cleaned. The 
necessary furniture should be in place’ and ready for 
use. An investigation should be made as to the kind 
of stove in use, how to ventilate the building, the light- 
ing system, the amount and kind of blackboard. 
There are certain routine duties that the teacher must 
plan before the school begins, and if these are well 
worked out the chances for success are multiplied. 
The seating of classes and individuals should be thought 
through tentatively. Children should be allowed to 
select their own seats as far as possible, but in case the 
seats chosen are not suitable the teacher should assist, 
because comfort aids greatly in securing attention and 
accomplishing results. 
Plans should be made regarding the best method of 
passing to and from classes. Often, equipment and 
other obstructions make this process more or less diffi- 
cult. Methods of caring for wraps should be considered. 
The best manner to convene school needs attention, 
i.e., shall the children line up outside and march in, or 
otherwise. Again the method of dismissal must be 
adapted to the building and equipment. Any other 
details peculiar to the school in which one is to teach 
will be taken under consideration, because if all these

  seemingly small details can be planned before the first 
day the teacher’s strength will be increased manyfold. 
Here, as elsewhere, “everlasting persistence is the price 
of safety.” 
Check Supplies.—This day of all days must be well 
planned. Each class should have something to do every 
minute. Seat work must be in readiness. Extra paper 
and pencils are provided for those who may have “for- 
gotten.”’ All supplies such as chalk, erasers, and desk 
copies of books in use must be at hand. The supplies 
needed for janitor work, the water-jar, drinking-cups, 
wash-dish, looking-glass, and all other equipment should 
be checked and located. 
Find School Records.—The classification register used 
by the former teacher should be secured from the presi- 
dent or secretary of the school board and carefully 
studied for several days before school begins in order 
that the teacher may properly organize and classify the 
school. From this record a tentative program should 
be made. This classification register, if properly kept 
by the former teacher, will include the following data: 
1. Names and ages of pupils. 
2. Classification of pupils. 
3. Record of progress in the county course of study 
for last term. 
4. Record of pupils’ standing and attainments in 
various branches. 
5. Studies completed the last term. 
6. Remarks and recommendations on. the work of 
each individual pupil. 
7. Number of classes and number of pupils in each 
class. 
8. Names and authors of text-books used.
-P-A-G-E-179
PLANNING FOR THE FIRST DAY 161 
9. Number of pages covered in these text-books. 
to. Remarks on the work of each class. 
ir. Complete copy of daily program of study and 
recitation. 
12. Needs of apparatus and books. 
In the chapter on records and reports a great deal of 
stress is placed upon this topic. If the former teacher 
has done what was expected of her in the matter of 
keeping full and complete records the new teacher will 
now be able to organize and arrange her classes without 
great loss of valuable time. She will not need to de- 
pend upon what some child may say about classes and 
other details. The record stands for itself. It is busi- 
nesslike. 
In the teacher’s desk or in the library there should 
be a copy of the State course or county course of study, 
which will assist in showing in detail the subjects to be 
taught in the various grades and the requirements for 
each grade. If you do not find such a course, ask your 
county superintendent for one. 
Plan a Tentative Program.—With the aid of the classi- 
fication register and the State or county course of study 
just discussed, the teacher will be able to formulate a 
temporary program of activity for the first day. The 
classes can be organized so that, work can begin at 
once. Educative seat work can be planned for the be- 
ginning classes. Every child in the school should be 
kept busy, and by careful planning with the data left 
by former records the teacher can prepare work for all 
classes. Some of the work planned should be spirited 
review material that will encourage the children to 
take hold of the new work with more zeal. All reading 
classes can be given interesting work.
-P-A-G-E-180
162 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
With this done the teacher should make plans for the 
opening exercises of the first day. It is almost impos- 
sible to estimate just how much depends upon the first 
impression that the boys and girls secure of their teacher. 
Hence the opening exercises should be thoroughly planned 
before the day arrives. 
The teacher should plan on making a little general 
talk on the first morning. This can be given in such a 
way as to gain the pupils’ confidence and good-will. 
The teacher should not begin by repeating rules and 
“don’ts,” but in a short “heart to heart”’ talk she should 
let the pupils understand that she is there to help them. 
She is their friend. Tell them she has only one rule, 
and that is ‘Do right,” and in a very tactful way let 
them know that as long as they do right all will be well. 
At this time the purpose of the school should be brought 
before the pupils. 
TEACHER’S Duties on First Day 
Be on Time.—To be on the ground before any of the 
pupils arrive is indeed important. The very fact that 
the teacher is there first to greet the pupils seems to 
make her case much stronger and gives her a feeling 
of security. To do this it may be necessary to get to 
the schoolhouse at 7.30 o’clock on the opening day. It 
shows a lack of energy and business ability to come to 
school late at any time, but more especially on the first 
day. If it is the season of the year for a fire, and the 
teacher is responsible, the room should be warm and 
comfortable when the children arrive. 
Have Schoolroom and Equipment in Readiness.—Even 
though the teacher has visited the schoolroom before
-P-A-G-E-181
     PLANNING FOR THE FIRST DAY 163 
school begins, now is the time to make final adjust- 
ments. All supplies should be placed on the teacher’s 
desk, such as extra papers, pencils, handwork materials. 
Erasers and chalk should be placed at the blackboards. 
Outlines, assignments, some problems for the arith- 
metic classes, and questions on the various reading- 
lessons should be placed on the board. If it is the season 
of fire-building, some extra fuel should be brought in. 
Although many anxious hands would volunteer to get a 
pail of water, it would be a very good plan for the 
teacher to get the water for this first day, so that nothing 
could prevent a good beginning. 
Meet Pupils——When the pupils begin to come in the 
teacher should give her entire attention to their needs 
—speak to them individually and inquire their names 
if she does not already know them. Make it as easy as 
possible for the bashful ones. Do not dictate as to what 
seats they shall take, but tell them to sit anywhere they 
desire, and when the opportune time comes let them 
know they may keep the seat of their choice as long as 
conditions remain satisfactory. Help the little ones 
with their wraps. Be as sociable as conditions will 
permit. Act natural. Carry on an easy conversation, 
but avoid questions concerning former teachers and 
their policies. 
Begin School on Time.—At nine o’clock “sharp” 
school should be called. Now is the time for the 
teacher “to begin as she expects to continue.” If she 
has certain plans to put into operation, marching in 
when school is called, for example, take time at this 
place to explain the why and wherefore, and have it 
done as planned. The same may be said of any activity 
that the teacher intends to put into practice.
-P-A-G-E-182
    164 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
Conduct Opening FExercises—School is called and 
every one sits expectant and still. _Now comes, perhaps, 
the most quiet time that will occur in the school during 
the year, also the best time to impress these waiting 
children. The new teacher’s plans are all strange and 
interesting. During the first few hours, discipline will 
be very easy indeed, because all attention is centered 
on the new conditions. At this time, the little speech 
mentioned above must be given. Much depends upon 
the following points as to how well the speech carries its 
message to these anxious listeners: 
First, how much real feeling is put into the voice and 
face of the teacher; second, the amount and use of tact; 
third, how much of “We,” and how little of “I” can be 
used. ~ 
Below is a suggestive weekly program for opening 
exercises: 
9.00-9.20—Opening Exercises 
Daily: 2 to 5 minutes: health report. 
Monday: General lessons in citizenship. 
Tuesday: Devotional (Bible stories, memorizing passages 
from Bible). 
Wednesday: Current events (chart of important events 
kept). 
Thursday: Devotional, as Tuesday. 
Friday: Voluntary program to motivate story-telling, 
reading composition, and singing. It may 
sometimes be a ‘“‘catch-up”’ period in draw- 
ing, handwork, and bird study. 
The opening exercise for the first day is, of course, 
different than any other day of the year, and can be 
varied to meet the needs. Jt must_be well planned. 
Continue Tentative Program Throughout the Day.— 
After the opening exercises are over, the work of the day
-P-A-G-E-183
      PLANNING FOR THE FIRST DAY 165 
begins. Every class and exercise planned should be 
carried on according to schedule. Every one should 
have a task. 
Recesses and all intermissions should receive atten- 
tion during the first day in order that the following days 
may be successful. 
Play needs supervision on this first day even more 
than any other day of the year. This is especially true 
if the playground has been neglected during former 
terms. The teacher should so plan her work and so 
encourage play that the boys and girls will enjoy the 
play periods more because she is there in their midst 
than they would without her. 
The noon lunch should be conducted according to 
plans for the year. This is more especially true of the 
supervised lunch than the lunch with the hot supple- 
ment. The hot supplement requires too much detail 
for first-day plans. 
The afternoon program ought to be carried on with 
as much zeal as the forenoon program. All assignments 
and plans for the following day must be made. The 
closing of school on this first day should be accomplished 
in due form and order so that the boys and girls will 
proceed to their homes feeling that the first day has 
been in the presence of a teacher whose plans and methods 
bespeak of business and progress. 
Thus the first day closes, and if the teacher has done 
the best she could, and has followed her well made plans, 
there will be no cause for regret. She may see where she 
can improve on her plans for the beginning day next 
term, but that is a sign of growth and not defeat. 
The necessity of the right type of a first day is shown 
by the following quotations and suggestions from C. P. 
Colegrove’s book, The Teacher and the School: 
     
-P-A-G-E-184
      166 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT     
The First Day.—The importance of the first day in the term 
is insisted upon by all writers on school management. Bell says: 
“Upon no other day of the school year does so much depend. 
The impressions made the first day, especially the first morning, 
will be lasting and will have a powerful influence for good or for 
bad upon all future work.”’ Questions of vital importance press 
upon the teacher for prompt and wise action. The pupils come, 
as a rule, full of interest and expectation and ready to fall in 
with plans and suggestions of the teacher, but with keen eyes 
for signs of weakness, insincerity, and sham. There are many 
problems that must be answered. They cannot be deferred or 
evaded. There is no one of whom to ask advice; the teacher 
must depend upon his own judgment. The great object of the 
teacher in this first day’s work is to make a favorable impression 
upon the school, to win the respect and good-will of all the 
pupils, and through them to gain the confidence of the parents. 
Some Additional Suggestions—Omit the opening exercises un- 
‘less you are sure that you can make them interesting and brief. 
Begin as you intend to continue during the term. 
Place the assignment of the first lessons on the blackboard 
before the time for opening the school. 
Endeavor to carry out your plans just as you have made 
them. Lose no time but assign work promptly, see that every 
pupil has something to do, and begin recitations as soon as pos- 
sible. : 
Aim to make the first day’s work a full day’s work, allowing 
no puttering, dawdling, or waste of time. 
Give very clear and definite directions for all movements and 
explain the signals to be used, and erforce all your signals and 
directions rigidly from the first. 
QUESTIONS

poor condition. The vaults need cleaning and the walls 
are covered with foul marks. What should she do 
about it?

CHAPTER Ix 
CLASSIFICATION AND ORGANIZATION OF A ONE- 
TEACHER SCHOOL 
The teacher of a one-room rural school, more than 
any other, needs guidance for her work through a well- 
planned course of study. With all of the elementary 
grades to teach, with little personal assistance from an 
experienced supervisor, with pupils frequently irregular 
in attendance, and with much changing both by pupils 
and teachers from one school to another, the possibili- 
ties for an aimless hit and miss effort are indeed plenti- 
ful.) A good course of study conscientiously followed 
by the teacher is, therefore, very essential. Colegrove * 
says concerning the course of study: “It is the most 
natural and concrete expression of the aims of the school. 
It serves the teacher both as chart and log-book. It 
makes possible the steady, unbroken progress of the 
pupil in his efforts to realize the aims of the school.” 
Teacher’s Responsibility.—The teacher’s responsi- 
bility in this matter cannot be emphasized too strongly. 
It is of vital importance to the success of the school 
that she should thoroughly understand the aims and 
purposes of a course of study and what it includes. It 
is equally important that she should conscientiously and 
wisely follow it. She must realize that at best it can 
only be a skeleton of the work to be done, and that it 
cannot be complete in specific directions for all details. 
No matter how much effort may have been put into the 
*C. P. Colegrove, The Teacher and the School. 
168
-P-A-G-E-187
ORGANIZATION OF A ONE-TEACHER SCHOOL 1€93 
preparation of it, and how perfect it may be, it still re- 
mains for the teacher to make it effective. It is she 
who must put life and purpose into it and apply it to 
the daily needs of the school. 
Teachers may ordinarily be divided into two general 
groups: first, those who use the course of*study, and 
second, those who do not. The teacher in the first 
group is the one who, when the county superintendent 
calls, can tell definitely where each class is with refer- 
ence to the course of study. She will have it on her 
desk, and its general appearance will show quite con- 
clusively that it has been in daily use. With a teacher 
in the second group it is quite different. She admits to 
the superintendent, with considerable embarrassment, 
that she does not know how she has kept pace with the 
course of study, and when he asks if he may see her copy, 
she blushes as she begins to search for it, and finally 
‘discovers it among some old papers in the bottom drawer 
of her desk. 
Aims of the Course of Study.—Concretely stated, 
some of the aims of the course of study are: 
1. To prevent blind, aimless, unsystematic work in 
our elementary schools. 
2. To provide a plain and progressive outline for the 
guidance of teachers, directors, and county superin- 
tendents, so that pupils may be encouraged to complete 
the elementary school course. 
3. To reduce to a minimum the waste of time, money, 
and effort caused by lack of proper organization, poor 
classification, defective program, and frequent change 
of teachers. 
4. To furnish definite outlines in all the subjects that 
the law requires to be taught in the elementary schools. 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
170 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
5. To arrange the subject matter of the course by 
years, units, and months, so that teachers and pupils 
may have a practical standard by which to measure 
their progress—may know where they are in the course. 
6. To unify the work of all the schools of a district, 
county, or State, and thus make effective supervision 
possible. " 
7. To enlist the ipterest of parents and secure their 
co-operation by making them acquainted with what 
the schools are striving to accomplish. 
What a Course of Study Should Include.—There are 
six groups of allied studies which are generally required 
to be taught in all elementary schools. With a few 
changes and additions we reproduce these groups as 
set forth in the Zowa Course of Study and Manual of 
Methods. 
1. Language and Literature Group.—This is the first 
and most important group in every elementary course. 
It includes (1) Reading; (2) Spelling; (3) Phonics; (4) 
Writing; (5) Language Work and Composition; (6) 
Grammar; (7) English Classics. 
The supreme importance of this group of studies is 
apparent for the following reasons: 
(a) These studies are valuable for their utility, their 
mental discipline, and their culture. 
(b) They afford the means of communication among 
men and thus make possible social co-operation. 
(c) They constitute the chief means by which pupils 
acquire knowledge both in school and after they leave 
the school. 
(d) They are the keys that unlock the treasures of 
civilized society and bring the pupils into intelligent 
and sympathetic union with the great ideals and as-
-P-A-G-E-189
ORGANIZATION OF A ONE-TEACHER SCHOOL 171 
pirations of the race as expressed in the world’s best 
literature. . 
2. Science Group.—tIn the elementary course, science 
is represented by (1) Nature Study; (2) Geography; (3) 
Physiology and Hygiene; (4) Elements of Science. 
It is the purpose of these studies to teach the pupil 
his relation to his environment. 
(a) The study of these subjects should cultivate the 
pupil’s power of perception and open his eyes to see the 
wonders of the world about him. 
(6) They should reveal to the child the beauty of the 
common things in nature. 
(c) They should give him a respect for his own body 
and a knowledge of how to care for it. 
(d) They should give him the power to picture vividly 
the places and countries that are beyond the reach of 
his senses and teach him to realize how closely distant 
countries are bound to his own community by social. 
commercial or political ties. 
(e) They should lay a sure foundation for the appre- 
ciative study of the natural sciences later in his course. 
3. Mathematics Group.—In this group are (1) Num- 
bers; (2) Arithmetic; (3) Business Forms. 
The aims of this group are exceedingly practical: 
(a) A knowledge of numbers and arithmetic is abso- 
lutely necessary in every department of learning. The 
lessons and pages and paragraphs in the reader are num- 
bered, as are the hours of the day, the days of the week 
and the month. The size and weight of all objects are 
expressed in numbers and ratios. The value of every 
article in the schoolroom or out of it is measured in 
arithmetical terms. The length of rivers, the height of 
mountains, the size of farms, the distance from home to
-P-A-G-E-190
172 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
school and from city to city, all are computed and ex- 
pressed by means of arithmetic. 
(6) Through the study of arithmetic the pupil reduces 
the world to an orderly and comparatively simple sys- 
tem of objects and forces controlled by general laws. 
(c) These studies afford the basis for the successful 
pursuit of all the exact sciences and all study of higher 
mathematics. 
(d) They afford a direct and essential preparation for 
the ordinary business transactions of daily life. 
4. History Group.—This group comprises (1) Oral 
Lessons; (2) Local History; (3) History; (4) State Civ- 
_ics; (5) Biography. 
One of the fundamental defects in our ordinary ele- 
mentary courses of study is that they make no provi- 
sion for the continuous and systematic study of history 
in the lower grades. To postpone the study of history 
until the sixth or the seventh year of the course in 
American schools is little less than criminal, for less than 
one-half of our boys and girls ever complete the work 
of the first six grades. Oral lessons in history in the 
form of myths, folk-lore, legends, traditions, stories, and 
biographies should have a place in all elementary courses 
during the first five years. The general aims of the his- 
tory group of studies are: 
(a) To prepare the pupil for the intelligent study of 
the text-book in United States history. 
(6) To direct the pupil’s outside reading in history 
and biography and save him from the slavery to the 
trashy reading so prevalent everywhere. 
(c) To acquaint pupils with human actions, motives, 
and virtues expressed in concrete forms in the lives of 
actual men and women; to set up ideals of conduct and
-P-A-G-E-191
  ORGANIZATION OF 'A ONE-TEACHER SCHOOL 173 
of service to humanity; to trace the origin, growth, and 
progress of the State; to reveal the relation of the indi- 
vidual to society; and to inspire the children in our 
schools with an intelligent love of their country and its’ 
institutions. 
(d) To teach all pupils the true meaning, value, and 
duties of citizens of the Republic. 
5. Art Group.—Included in this group are (1) Vocal 
Music; (2) Drawing and Painting; (3) Physical Training. 
These studies are a necessary part of the education of 
every child. ‘ 
(a) They afford the only means and opportunity for 
zsthetic culture that most pupils will ever have. 
(6) Vocal music affords a natural opportunity for 
teaching good bodily habits, correct breathing, and dis- 
tinct articulation. It is an excellent means of teaching 
quickness and accuracy of sight and hearing, arousing 
right feeling, and concentrating the attention. 
(c) Drawing, painting, and hand work are easy, nat- 
ural, and graphic modes of expressing ideas. They im- 
press knowledge upon the mind in the most effective 
way, cultivate accurate observation, stimulate interest, 
and form the basis of clear and definite memory images. 
6. Vocational Subjects —The trend of present-day ele- 
mentary education is away from the extreme bookish- 
ness of the ordinary school education. This trend. is 
shown in the laws, recently enacted in so many States, 
requiring teachers to give instruction in vocational 
subjects. These subjects include (1) Elementary Agri- 
culture; (2) Domestic Science, or Household Arts; (3) 
Constructive Work and the Manual Arts. 
The aims of these vocational subjects are partly edu- 
cational and partly practical.

| (@) They should afford pupils a natural and welcome 
relief from the monotony and drudgery of continuous 
book study. 
(b) They should lessen the evils of fatigue, prevent 
eye-strain, offset the dangers of close confinement to 
seats, and encourage pupils to express and apply their 
knowledge as fast as it is acquired. 
(c) They should help to bridge the chasm between the 
life of the school and the life outside the school. They 
should serve to connect the school with the home, the 
shop, and the field. 
(d) They should stimulate interest in every other 
study in the course and vitalize all the instruction of the 
school, revealing to the pupil the worth of knowledge as 
a means of sustaining life, securing the comforts of the 
home, and ministering in manifold ways to the happi- 
ness and welfare of mankind. 
A Plan of Organization.—The plan on pages 174 and 
175, and notes on the plan, for the organization of the 
course of study in a one-teacher school are taken from 
an Iowa State Teachers’ College bulletin. It represents 
the combined thought and experience of several people, 
both teachers and supervisors, who have seriously 
studied this problem in the actual operation of a number 
of one-teacher schools. 
Notes ON THE PLAN FOR THE ORGANIZATION OF THE 
CourRSsE OF STUDY IN A RuRAL OR OTHER ONE- 
TEACHER SCHOOL 
Reading.—Separate classes should be formed for the 
I, II, II, and IV year pupils. ‘The combination of III 
and IV year pupils in reading is not recommended, (1) 
because of the transition from emphasis on the mechanics 
 
-P-A-G-E-195
ORGANIZATION OF A ONE-TEACHER SCHOOL 177 
of reading to emphasis on the thought content, which 
should have been made by the time a child has finished 
his third year in school, and (2) because of the consecu- 
tively graded nature of the material in most standard 
Third Readers, which makes it an injustice to a IV 
year pupil to require him to go back over the same 
ground a second time. V and VI year pupils may be 
grouped in one class to take up Fourth Reader material; 
VII and VIII year pupils in one class with Fifth Reader 
material, where a five-book series is used. Silent read- 
ing should form a part of the reading lesson in the class 
period. When a whole class period is devoted to silent 
reading and individual reports, the “C,” “B,” and “A” 
divisions may often be grouped into one class. Much 
material in history, geography, and arithmetic may be 
regarded as having silent reading value. 
Language.—The language needs of I and II year 
pupils will be taken care of in the general lesson period, 
supplemented, wherever possible, by an additional oral 
language period each day. Separate classes should be 
formed for III and IV, V and VI, and VII and VIII 
year pupils. At least one day a week should be devoted 
to the formation of correct language habits, and to the 
correction of errors in English. This may profitably 
be done by means of language games. For this work 
pupils of various divisions may be grouped in one class. 
The language work of the ‘C” and “D” divisions should 
be largely oral. Where a text-book is put into the hands 
of the III and IV year pupils, the book should be used 
as a guide to the teacher, not as a text for the pupils. 
Phonics and Spelling —Unless the manual of the 
method used in phonics requires a different line of pro- 
cedure, I year pupils should not begin phonics until they

have acquired a sufficient stock of sight words to enable 
them to read with more or less ease. Separate classes 
should be formed for the I and II year pupils for the 
teaching of phonics, the classes reciting on alternate 
days. When I year pupils have received sufficient in- 
struction in phonic elements, they may be grouped with 
II year pupils for drill. The work in phonics should be 
definitely related to the reading lesson as soon as the 
pupils’ knowledge of phonic elements permits it. 
Spelling as a separate subject need not be provided 
for in the first two years. The written language needs, 
which spelling serves, may be met in these years in con- 
nection with the assignment, preparation, and presen- 
tation of the daily lesson in language. Two separate 
periods for spelling daily for the pupils above the II 
year are sufficient for any one-teacher school. The 
recitation period should be long enough to enable the 
teacher to handle the work on the basis of the individual 
needs of the pupils. The close relation existing be- 
tween spelling and written language should always be 
observed. 
Writing.—A separate period should be devoted not 
less than three times a week to the teaching of writing 
for all pupils above the II year. Special attention 
should be given in connection with the language work 
to the teaching of beginners to write and to the indi- 
vidual needs of all the pupils in writing. Every written 
lesson, especially the spelling lesson, should be a writing 
lesson. 
Mathematics —Pupils of the I and II years should 
have separate class periods in numbers. An occasional 
combination of these groups may be made for number 
games. III and IV year pupils may be grouped to-

gether; V year pupils should have a separate class period, 
because so many of the important phases of the subse- 
quent work in arithmetic are based upon a proper 
knowledge of fractions. One recitation period of not 
less than thirty minutes should be set aside for the work 
of VI, VII, and VIII year pupils in arithmetic. The 
pupils of each year may be given different assignments 
of work, all, however, working at the board at the same 
time under supervision of the teacher. The teacher 
should take care to see that her attention is distributed 
among the different groups and to plan her work so 
that only the pupils of any one year may take up a 
new topic in any given day. Thoughtful considera- 
tion of this plan will prove that it is quite different 
from an alternation of study and recitation. Bear in 
mind constantly the necessity of adjusting subject 
matter to the needs of the pupils. All problem material 
should be related to actual life situations. 
Following is an outline of essential subject matter: 
Year I 
Reading and writing numbers to too. / 
Twenty-five addition combinations (none of them more than Io). 
Subtraction as inverse of addition. 
Denominate numbers: inch, foot, pint, quart, nickel, dime, quar- 
ter, etc. 
Year II 
Reading and writing numbers to 1,000. 
Remainder of the forty-five addition combinations. 
Completion of the subtraction combinations arising from addi- 
tion combinations. Multiplication introduced. 
Denominate numbers continued. 
Years III and IV 
Review and extension of work of preceding years to secure a 
basis for classification.  
-P-A-G-E-198
  180 - RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
Column addition and subtraction. 
Completion of multiplication tables. 
Short division. 
Long division. 
Problem work to illustrate all processes with integers. 
Year V 
Common fractions introduced as a type of number. 
Fundamental operations with common fractions, limiting work 
to fractions of ordinary difficulty. 
Decimal fractions introduced through U. S. money. 
Years VI and VII 
Reviews and drills in the phases of common fractions. 
Completion of decimal fractions. 
Introduction and development of percentage. 
Application of percentage in profit and loss, trade discount, com- 
mission. 
Mensuration of length and of plane figures. 
Constant use of problems for illustration and development of 
principles. 
Year VIII 
Problems in taxes, insurance, stocks and bonds. 
Business practices. 
Mensuration of solids in actual use. 
Music.—All the pupils of the school may be grouped 
in one class for most cf the work in music. The use of 
the talking machine is recommended as the basis for 
the standardization of this work. Instructions in the 
elements of musical theory should be given only to 
pupils above the IV year. 
General Lessons—No organization of a one-teacher 
school is complete without a general lesson period for 
pupils in the first four years. The work of the five days 
of the week may be arranged as follows:
-P-A-G-E-199
  ORGANIZATION OF A ONE-TEACHER SCHOOL 181

Monday. Language Games for I, II, III, and IV years. 
Tuesday. Community Civics for I, II, II, and IV years. 
Patriotism, memorizing patriotic gems, study of 
the flag, thrift, good manners, morals, health, 
citizenship stories, and other lessons pertaining 
to little citizens of U. S. 
Wednesday. Language Games for I, II, III, and IV years. 
Thursday. Primary Geography, I, II, III years, taught 
chiefly through Nature Study and Nature 
Stories. Picture study of animals and other 
nature subjects, along with directions, weather 
chart, and land forms of locality. 
Friday. Story Hour, I, II, and III years. 
Fairy tales, myths, history stories (about peo- 
ple), Mother Goose, picture study, etc. 
Observation, conversation, dramatization, oral 
sentence structure. 
Geography.—The essential work in geography in the 
first three years will be done through general lessons. 
A separate class period for geography and history will 
be maintained each year for IV-year pupils, the work 
in each subject being taken up alternately by monthly 
units. A similar plan of alternation by monthly units 
will be followed in the organization of the work in his- 
tory and geography for V and VI year pupils and for 
VII and VIII year pupils. 
History.—One general lesson period a week may be 
devoted to the teaching of history to pupils in the first 
three years. A separate class period for geography and 
history will be maintained each year for IV-year pupils, 
the work in each subject being taken up alternately by 
monthly units. The plan of monthly alternation is 
recommended to be followed in history class organiza-

tion for the pupils of V and VI and of the VII and VIII 
years. 
A brief outline of subject matter follows: 
Years I, II, and III. 
Study of primitive life, and projects growing out of them. 
“Special days” in connection with the opening exercise period. 
Year IV. 
State history, pioneer projects, and Greek and Roman history 
stories. 
Years V and VI. 
European history stories fundamental to American history; 
American history stories, with emphasis on chronology of 
main events. 
Years VII and VIII. 
The study of an advanced text in American history. 
Physiology and Hygiene—Lessons in personal and 
community hygiene will form a part of the work in 
community civics in the first four years. As indicated 
below, in the V and VI years the study of an elementary 
text, and in the VII and VIII years the study of an ad- 
vanced text, in hygiene may be taken up in alternation 
monthly with community civics. See State Outline, “A 
Course in Citizenship.” 
Community Civics——For the work of the first four 
years in community civics, see General Lessons and State 
Outline in Community Citizenship. This work should 
alternate in monthly units with hygiene. 
V and VI year pupils may be combined for this work. 
VII and VIII year pupils may take up the study of an 
advanced text in civics and citizenship in monthly alter- 
nation with an advanced text in hygiene. Throughout 
all of this work in community civics, opportunity should

never be lost to relate it closely to the work in languag VY 
the composition phase of which may be based largely 
upon topics drawn from community civics. 
Drawing and Handwork.—Drawing and handwork 
for the pupils in the first four years should be closely 
connected with and grow out of their reading, language, 
and general lessons. A definite period for the teaching 
of drawing and handwork should be planned for all 
other pupils at least twice each week. 
Industrial Subjects —In the first four years of the 
course the work in the industrial subjects should be 
limited to the work in nature study and drawing and 
handwork given in connection with the general lessons 
and language. Because of the nature of the work in 
domestic science and manual training, an ordinary reci- 
tation period of fifteen or twenty minutes is not suffi- 
ciently long to accomplish much work of real value. 
The time on Friday afternoon following recess should 
be set aside for the work in manual training and domes- 
tic science by all pupils above the IV year. While the 
upper grade pupils are engaged in industrial work, the 
pupils of the first four years may be engaged in hand- 
work growing out of their general lessons. Thirty min- 
utes a week may be secured for the work in agriculture 
by taking one period from that set aside for the “A” 
and “B” reading for both boys and girls.

CHAPTER X 
THE DAILY PROGRAM 
The daily program should be the teacher’s general 
plan of daily work, by which she strives to accomplish 
the aims and purposes of the course of study. Through 
it she should endeavor, first, to distribute her time fairly 
among all of her pupils in all of their subjects, and sec- 
ond, to prevent loss of time and energy by providing 
for an orderly arrangement of the day’s activities. 
Making a Program.—The making of a program for 
any school is not an easy task. It is an especially diffi- 
cult one for the rural teacher. Difficult because the 
two factors which largely determine the program vary 
greatly in rural schools. Those two factors are (1) the 
number of grades in the school and (2) the subjects re- 
quired by the course of study. It is impossible, because 
of these variations, to give a “ready made” program 
that will meet exactly the conditions found in all schools. 
Certain factors, however, are Constant, and should 
always be given consideration in the preparation of 
programs. 
Factors in a Rural School. —To_present_the problem 
more concretel rs_as the teacher of a

1. Twenty pupils from five to thirteen years of age, 
with one or more in each of the eight grades. 
2. A course of study indicating what each pupil was 
to take.

3. Three hundred thirty minutes for recitations. 
4. To apportion the time fairly (a) as to pupils, () 
as to subjects. 
5. To adjust the length of the recitation periods to 
the age of the pupils and nature of the subjects. 
6. To provide for an occupation program and to have 
the study period for a given subject follow immediately 
the recitation period for that subject. 
7. To avoid having writing and drawing exercises 
come immediately after an intermission. 
8. To provide for a variety of occupation and for 
intervals of relaxation. 
9. To reduce the number of recitations to thirty or 
less. 
Apportioning the Teacher’s Time.—The first step in 
the making of a program is to properly apportion the 
teacher’s time. Two things must be borne in mind by 
the teacher: first, to give to each grade its fair share 
of her time, and second, to properly apportion the time 
given to each grade among the six groups of studies ac- 
cording to their importance. 
Most teachers have a preference for the work of cer- 
tain grades. One prefers the primary work, another the 
more advanced grades. When all, or nearly all, of the 
grades are represented, it is important, then, that the 
teacher should not permit her personal preference to 
interfere with the time to which each grade is entitled. 
Again, teachers usually have a preference for certain 
subjects within the grades. If the time apportioned to 
each grade is not carefully divided among the six groups 
of subjects, the teacher is in danger of devoting too 
much time to those which she most prefers. In the 
lower grades the language group should be given the
-P-A-G-E-205

THE DAILY PROGRA‘« 187 
greater part of the time. It constiiutes the tools with 
which the pupil masters the other subjects. As we 
proceed higher in the grades, the language group should 
each year give way more and more to the other groups, 
especially history and science. The programs given in 
this chapter should serve as a guide as to the relative 
importance of each group in each grade. 
Reducing Number of Classes.—In many rural schools 
the problem of reducing the number of recitations per 
day is a very difficult one. Several solutions of this 
‘problem are offered. It remains for the teacher to ap- 
ply one or more of them to her own individual situation. 
(1) By the Use of General Lessons—The work in 
. writing, drawing or music can be presented in general 
lessons to the entire school. The first three or four 
grades can be combined for general lessons in the con- 
tent subjects. The industrial or hand work can also be 
given to the whole school at one time, although the 
work should be graded as to difficulty. 
(2) By Combining Classes or Grades——Pupils in the 
first year may be combined with those of the second 
year in nature study or in hand work. Pupils in the 
second and third years may be combined in arithmetic. 
Classes in third, fourth, and fifth years may be com- 
bined in spelling. The seventh and eighth grade pupils 
may recite together in arithmetic, reading, orthography, 
history, geography or physiology. 
No fixed rule for combining classes can be followed. 
Classes that are nearest equal in ability should be com- 
bined. In one school it may be desirable to combine 
the seventh and eighth grades in reading; in another 
school the sixth and seventh, and in still another the 
sixth, seventh, and eighth.

188 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
(3) By Alternating General Lessons, Classes, Subjects, 
or Even Dropping Out a Whole Year of the Course.—(a) 
As to general lessons. The teacher may alternate writing 
with drawing, or she may give three general lessons a 
week in writing and two in drawing. Some subjects 
like the manual arts may have to be crowded into one 
or two lessons a week. : 
(b) As to classes. If the teacher finds it necessary 
to maintain small classes in the eighth year in order 
that pupils may finish the course, she may have some of 
these classes recite on alternate days. This plan should 
not be used in the lower grades in any of the leading 
branches. 
(c) As to subjects. Sometimes it will be best to drop 
a subject for the first half of the year and take it up for 
the second half of the year, or when some other subject in 
the same division has been completed. In such cases, 
longer lessons must be assigned, for pupils must com- 
plete the subject in shorter time. But such intensive 
study in fewer branches will permit longer periods for 
recitation and will secure better results than to require 
pupils to take many subjects, with shorter lessons and 
the time of recitation limited. 
(d) As to years of the course. In Illinois and some 
other States, elaborate plans of alternating the different 
years of the course have been worked out. By this 
system, the work of an entire year of the course, or all 
the work except one or two leading subjects, may be 
dropped out for one year, thus reducing the number of 
classes and increasing the length of the recitation pe- 
riod. The next year, classes are organized in the studies 
that have been dropped, and no new classes are formed 
for the previous year’s work. In beginning such a plan,    
-P-A-G-E-207
  _THE DAILY PROGRAM 189 
classes must be formed in all the subjects of the first 
year, but in the second year’s work, new classes are or- 
ganized in reading, numbers, and spelling only. In the 
following year new classes are organized in all the sub- 
jects of the second year, but no new classes are formed 
in the first year except reading, numbers, and spelling. 
(4) By Relating of Subjects—(a) Within the same 
group. The course of study consists of six groups of 
closely related subjects, as already explained. Corre- 
lation within these groups is always possible. Language 
and reading may be combined in one class. Other good 
opportunities for teaching two subjects in one class are 
phonics with reading in the first year; reading with lan- 
guage or spelling in the second year; construction work with 
household arts in the sixth year; reading with orthography 
in the eighth year. 
(b) Correlation Between Studies in. Different Groups. 
Each year of the course affords excellent opportunities 
for such correlation. Classes can be combined in 
nature study and agriculture, numbers and handwork, oral 
history and language, drawing and manual arts or con- 
struction work, geography and agriculture. 
With all these different methods by which the num- 
ber of classes may be diminished, there is little excuse 
for permitting the use of a program of thirty classes 
even in our largest rural schools. 
Length of Recitation Period.—The length of the reci- 
tation period should be regulated by the age of the 
pupils and the nature and difficulty of the subject. 
Primary pupils cannot give close attention for long 
periods of time. Several short periods of ten or fifteen 
minutes are better than one period so long that the 
pupil’s interest in the subject-matter lags. With the 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
  190 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
more advanced classes the ability of the pupils in any 
particular subject may have to be given consideration. 
If a teacher finds that her eighth grade is unusually 
deficient in arithmetic, she should give special atten- 
tion to that subject in that class. 
Occupation Program.-A good program provides for 
study and seat work between recitations. Pupils in the 
tural schools spend only a small part of the day in reci- 
tations. It is the duty of the teacher, therefore, to 
direct the pupils’ studying by placing before them a 
carefully prepared program of occupation. Disorder in 
school frequently results from a pupil’s idleness. When 
the pupils have definitely assigned work for each study 
period they are less likely to get into mischief. For the 
primary pupils the employment should consist largely of 
play and different forms of handwork. 
In most of the subjects pupils should study the ad- 
vanced lesson immediately after the recitation, and 
again just before the next recitation in that subject. 
If a lesson has been well taught and the assignment 
well made, the pupil’s interest in the subject should be 
such that he will immediately want to proceed with the 
preparation of his next lesson. The few minutes just 
before the recitation should be used to review the pre- 
vious preparation. 
Writing and Drawing.—The period for formal in- 
struction in writing and drawing should never follow 
an intermission or period of physical activity. These 
exercises require steady nerves. If the teacher uses the 
intermission period for the purpose for which it is in- 
tended, that is, play and exercise, the pupils will not 
be in the best physical condition for work that requires 
fine muscular control.
-P-A-G-E-209
    THE DAILY PROGRAM 191 
Variety of Occupation and Intervals of Relaxation.— 
A variety of occupation should be provided, especially 
for the younger pupils. Their interest in any one line 
of activity cannot be held very long. Frequent changes 
in the nature of their work will prevent restlessness and 
disorder. Intervals of relaxation also help to maintain 
interest and to keep up a good spirit. The attention of 
pupils is usually best during the periods immediately 
following the convening of school, either in the morning 
or after intermissions. As the pupils concentrate upon 
their work after the intermission they become mentally 
fatigued. A few minutes for a good game will do much 
to relieve this situation. In one of the programs that 
follow provision is made for a three-minute recreation 
period. This might profitably be given during each of 
the quarter-day sessions. 
Program Posted and Followed.—The recitation and 
the occupation program should be printed or written in 
large legible letters. A piece of cardboard about twenty- 
two by twenty-eight inches in size may well be used for 
each half day’s program. ‘These cards should then be 
placed on one of the walls of the schoolroom in such a 
position that the program can be read from any part 
of the room. After the program has been posted it 
should be very strictly followed. There will be many 
strong temptations to “run over time.” If the lesson 
is well taught the pupils may say: “Oh, don’t let us 
stop now.” Again, there will be times when the teacher 
is tempted to change the program because she has vis- 
itors. All such changes should be avoided. If it is 
important to have a program, it is equally as important 
to adhere to it. At the close of the term the teacher 
should leave a copy of her program for her successor.

Why should not the third and fourth grades be combined in 
Reading? 
2.Why is it better to have a pupil write a written lesson on the

Parents sometimes criticise a teacher in the rural school be- 
cause she does not have a pupil recite more often. What 
should be the teacher’s attitude in such cases? 
. Why may several grades be combined in Spelling? 
. Should number work be omitted in the first grade? 
PROBLEMS 
. Compare the number of minutes devoted to Reading in 
each grade in the daily programs in this chapter. 
. Give the number of minutes of recitation given to each grade 
in each program.

CHAPTER XI 
PHYSICAL EDUCATION 
Intermission periods may be of great value in a school. 
Likewise they may be the source of unrest, immorality, 
and the center of poor citizenship training. Many 
teachers conduct good classroom work; they demand and 
secure good order during ‘school time,” but apparently 
do nothing to continue this ideal during intermissions. 
Teacher’s Duty.—The teacher must plan intermis- 
sions as carefully as she plans for regular school work. 
She must consider all phases and possibilities of these 
intermissions and meet them with a definite program. 
The teacher must take an active part in these intermis- 
sions in order to teach co-operation, manners, citizen- 
ship, and many other virtues, by precept and example. 
A teacher must be a fun-maker and not a fun-destroyer. 
She may well be the inspiration of a well-directed play 
period, as well as the source of many hearty laughs. 
Development Through Play.—All careful observers 
have noticed that those animals which play most when 
young make the most intelligent and resourceful adults. 
The larger the proportion of time spent in infancy, that 
is, in the play-time of life, the higher the creature rises 
in the scale of animal life. The young of earth worms, 
turtles, and barnyard fowls play but little; the adults 
remain on a very low plane of intelligence. The young 
of cats, dogs, foxes, and horses spend much time in 
play; the adults rise to a high plane of intelligence. 
The young of man has the longest play-time of all; the 
212
-P-A-G-E-231
PHYSICAL EDUCATION 213 
adult is master over all. Evidently nature has found 
the playground the best school, and play a very im- 
portant factor in making a man. 
Play a Part of the School Program.—The above fact 
is rapidly being recognized in modern education. Ger- 
    SUPERVISED PLAY IN A ONE-TEACHER SCHOOL 
Notice the teacher near the corner of the building 
many requires that organized, supervised play be made 
a part of every common-school course. The larger 
cities of the United States are paying fabulous prices for 
land. Many school boards now require teachers to 
write into their contracts that they will spend a stipu- 
lated time in play with the children each day. Others 
are providing playground directors. Throughout the 
civilized world, the dwarfed intellects and weakened 
   
-P-A-G-E-232
  214 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
bodies resulting from child-labor have created an in- 
sistent demand that all children be given an oppor- 
tunity to play and grow into capable men and women. 
Play and Exercise Not Synonymous.—Play and exer- 
cise are not synonymous terms. They are not of equal 
importance in education. Play is fun indulged in for 
its own sake. Play means, in addition to exercise, free- 
dom to choose, freedom to plan and to execute the plan. 
Nature offers us free play as the very best school ever 
devised for developing the power of initiative—‘ the 
ability to originate, the aptitude to develop and under- 
take new enterprises.” 
Rural Children Do Not Know How to Play.—The 
writer’s experience on many school playgrounds leads 
him to believe that the children in America who have 
the least aptitude for play, and who have had the least 
opportunity to develop by it, are the children on the 
farm. Parents in the country many times erroneously 
believe that the work of the farm and the home will 
furnish all the physical exercise necessary to the grow- 
ing child. It is true that home and farm duties, those 
“chores” of fond remembrance, take a very valuable 
part in the education of country boys and girls; but it 
also is true that they need the opportunity to plan and 
“originate new enterprises and execute them freely on 
the playground to develop their powers of initiative 
and self-reliance. 
Teacher a Play Leader.—The rural teacher who rec- 
ognizes the important part that play has in education 
will plan her daily work so that she will be free to spend 
noon and recess periods with the children on the play- 
ground. The teacher who knows some good games 
adapted to rural school conditions, and who shows skill
-P-A-G-E-233
  PHYSICAL EDUCATION 215 
and enthusiasm in playing them with the children, soon 
becomes the natural leader on the playground. Close 
acquaintance and cordial relationships between teacher 
and pupils follow. Curtis, the playground expert, well 
says: “The familiarity of the playground does not breed 
contempt unless the teacher is contemptible.” A 
teacher may safely join in the play if she assumes equal 
leadership when school calls. 
By-Products of Supervised Play.—The close acquain- 
tance and cordial relationship which follow when the 
teacher has become captain on the playground enable 
the teacher to gather about herself all the pupils of her 
school that they may enjoy together the development 
which comes from well-directed, enthusiastic, free play. 
Pupils thus happily engaged on the playground with 
their teacher find no time for immoral thoughts or deeds. 
Bickering and quarrelling and neighborhood gossip, 
which sometimes disrupt a school, cease. The teacher 
returns to the schoolroom at the close of the play period 
to find renewed pleasure in instruction. Pupils return to 
their school work with renewed appetites for study; their 
excess energy has been turned into the right channel. 
The wideawake teacher will discover leaders that she 
did not know existed when these children were in the 
schoolroom. On the playground leadership will appear, 
and the teacher can in many cases transfer this quality 
to the schoolroom. 
The laggard and the bully may be discovered and each 
made to see his proper place in this social group. The 
laggard forgets his lazy attitude and the bully lines him- 
self up in the game of “give and take” until all are 
happy to practise that greatest of virtues in. society 
—co-operation. 
 
-P-A-G-E-234
216 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
Parents sometimes complain with reason that the evil 
which pupils learn from each other about the school 
grounds outweighs the good learned from the teacher in 
the schoolroom. No teacher can afford to use the rec- 
reation periods preparing school work, performing jani- 
tor service, or taking her personal ease. The teacher 
who is captain on the playground is making use of one 
of nature’s educational forces to gain easy mastery over 
her school. A county superintendent said recently: “I 
consider the supervision and leadership of the teacher 
on the playground so important that in visiting schools 
I plan to reach the schools at recess or noon, and first of 
all I look to see whether the teacher is with the children 
on the playground.” 
Games Adapted to Age of Children.—On the rural school 
playground the teacher must be able to manage groups 
of different ages. She must have several games in mind 
for the various groups, and use some older trustworthy 
child to direct the games for the younger groups. The 
teacher should direct and take part in the older group 
games if possible, but greater success would follow if she 
could keep in touch generally with all games and play 
activities during intermissions. There are, however, 
many good games in which children of all ages may take 
part. These would be the proper kind to play in rural 
schools where the teacher may have difficulty in securing 
assistance from her pupils. 
A normal child cares for different types of games at 
different periods of his development. As his powers de- 
velop he seeks instinctively the elements in play that 
will contribute to growth. When games are studied 
from this standpoint they fall into the following 
groups:
-P-A-G-E-235
  PHYSICAL EDUCATION 217 
1. Games for children between four and six years: 
(a) Plays in which there is much repetition. 
(6) Plays involving impersonations. 
(c) Games of simple chase (one chaser and one runner). 
(d) Games of short duration. 
2. Games for children between seven and twelve years: 
(a) Games of longer duration than in first group. 
(b) Games more complicated. 
(c) Games which involve the choosing of sides. 
(d) Games with less repetition. 
3. Games for children between twelve and eighteen: 
(a) Team games. 
(6) Competitive forms of play. 
(c) Games fostering team spirit. 
(d) Games in which co-operation, skill, and loyalty 
make for success. 
Characteristics of Good Games for Rural Schools—A 
number of our best games, such as the great American 
game of baseball, for example, are not suited to the con- 
ditions in the average one-room rural school to-day. 
Baseball requires eighteen players. The average atten- 
dance in rural schools is less. The small children can- 
not well play baseball with the larger ones. Girls do 
not play the game so well as boys, because the hard ball 
injures their hands. Baseball cannot be played in the 
winter time, when games are most needed in the rural 
school. Football and basketball likewise fail to meet 
the needs of the rural school. Good rural school games 
will meet the following: 
Must Be Suited for All Ages and Both Sexes—Many 
games should permit the teacher to gather into the same 
group all the pupils of her school, large and small, boys
-P-A-G-E-236
218 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
and girls. The game should be such that the parents 
will enjoy taking part when they visit the school or 
attend community-center meetings. 
A Varying Number of Players —The game should per- 
mit of a wide variation in the number of players. Some 
rural schools have five pupils; some have thirty. The 
game should be capable of accommodating an odd or an 
even number of players. 
Out-of-Doors All Seasons of the Year.—The game should 
be of such a nature that it may be played out-of-doors 
with comfort during the fall, winter, or spring months. 
Games played in fresh outdoor air accomplish their pur- 
pose much better than games played in the dusty and 
less pure atmosphere of the schoolroom. 
Limited Space.—Although the open country stretches 
away in every direction from the rural schoolhouses, 
many of these schools are greatly hampered for suitable 
playground space. Hills or lesser inequalities of surface, 
ditches, fences, trees, or buildings so reduce the area 
available for playground purposes in many schools that 
games must be played on a very limited space. 
Inexpensive Equipment.—As many patrons have not 
yet come to a realization of the important part play may 
have in education, it is still difficult to secure funds to 
provide equipment for games in the rural schools. The 
school should buy the necessary play equipment. No 
equal expenditure of school funds will bring larger edu- 
cational results. 
Reasonable Safety.—While the game should permit of 
vigorous exercise, the players should be reasonably safe 
from danger of injury. Rough, strenuous games should 
not be played. Using hard baseballs, swings that are 
too high, and any equipment likely to be injurious should 
be avoided.   
 
-P-A-G-E-237
  PHYSICAL EDUCATION 219 
Fun: Game Played for Its Own Sake.—To secure the 
best educational results, the game should be one which 
the pupils enjoy playing for its own sake. It should 
permit the pupils to originate and execute the manceu- 
vres of the game. It should take advantage of the in- 
stinct of rivalry. It should be free play, as contrasted 
with mechanical physical exercises to the count of a 
drill-master. 
EQUIPMENT FOR PLAY 
(1) An indoor baseball, costing from two dollars to 
five dollars, depending upon the quality, is perhaps one 
of the most useful pieces of apparatus for the rural 
school. This large, soft ball will displace the small, 
hard baseball, and can be used for many good team 
games. 
(2) A sand-pile for the little folk should be placed in 
such a position that the teacher can supervise its activi- 
ties to a certain extent during school hours. The little 
children might use it to advantage for short relaxation 
periods during nice weather. 
(3) A volley ball and volley ball net, provided that 
the children are old enough to play the game. 
(4) One or two low swings. 
(5) Two low teeters. 
(6) Bean-bags, can-rubbers for ring-toss games, sticks 
of wood for all-up-relay races, hoops for hoop-race relays, 
a twenty-five cent bat for indoor baseball. 
(7) A home-made merry-go-round made out of the 
rear axle of an old discarded farm wagon. (Remove one 
wheel and the reach braces, and place in the ground the 
axle from which the wheel has been removed. Put it 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
220 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
in cement if possible. Then bolt planks on to the spokes 
of the wheel, which will rotate similarly to a merry-go- 
round.) 
ADMINISTRATION 
Physical education in rural schools can best be ad- 
ministered through: (1) Contest Games, (2) Athletic 
Efficiency Tests, (3) Correct Posture Tests, (4) Singing 
Games and Rhythmic Plays. 
Contest games may be divided into two groups, viz.: 
games for outdoors and games for the schoolroom. The 
outdoor games should answer the characteristics men- 
tioned on pages 217-218 in this chapter. The indoor 
games must necessarily be less noisy and capable of 
many changes to meet the existing conditions within the 
schoolroom. These indoor games should seldom be used 
on days when the weather is fine, for the ideal place in 
which to play games is outdoors. 
Rural boys and girls very rarely have a chance to de- 
velop any skill in athletics. Many of them, in fact, 
never know whether they can run, jump, or throw a 
baseball better than any one else. The Athletic Effi- 
ciency Tests make it possible for girls and boys to com- 
pete in age and weight classes, not against each other, 
but against certain standards that have been worked 
out with thousands of boys and girls of similar ages and 
weights. This plan makes it possible for every healthy 
child to take part in certain activities suited to his physi- 
cal ability and from year to year to see his own ability 
advance as he undertakes more advanced work. 
Correct posture in standing and walking is very im- 
portant in the development of strong, healthy bodies. 
Nothing will develop this more than the ‘‘Triple Tests”
-P-A-G-E-239

as suggested by Miss Jessie Bancroft, in her book, The 
Posture of School Children, which will be found invalu- 
able. 
The esthetic nature of the child needs development; 
his sense of rhythm and grace must receive expression. 
Rhythmic plays, singing games, and folk-dances have 
their place in such development. Miss Clark, in her 
book, Physical Training for Elementary Schools, says: 
“These rhythmic plays fill a place in the training of the 
body that can be supplied in no other way. Aside from 
the wonderful hygienic value and the development of 
rhythm and grace, they provide a simple mode of dra- 
matic expression which is needed in our hurried com- 
mercial life.” 
OurTpoorR AND INDOOR GAMES 
Games for playground and schoolroom must be con- 
sidered in every rural school program. Below is a list 
of games which have been tried in the rural schools affili- 
ated with the Iowa State Teachers’ College and found 
to be very satisfactory. 
The outdoor games have been given rather a complete 
analysis in order to help the teacher who has not had 
much experience or fraining in playground supervi- 
sion. 
Dodge Ball.—Played with indoor baseball. All the 
pupils may play. Players stand in a circle twenty to 
thirty feet in diameter, depending on the number and 
size of the players. One player goes into the circle. 
This is the position of honor. A player on the circle 
throws the ball at the player in center, who runs about 
to keep from being struck by the ball. If the ball misses 
the player in the center, some player on the circle oppo- a rc 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
222 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
site the thrower catches the ball and throws at the 
player “‘in-center.” When struck, the player ‘“‘in-cen- 
ter’’ exchanges places with the successful thrower. 
Points to be noted in the teaching of dodge ball. 
Dodge ball cultivates skill in throwing, dodging, and 
catching. In addition, it is valuable in developing grace- 
ful, natural movement. 
1. Catching must be emphasized most. Teach the 
players on the circle to be constantly alert whenever the 
ball is to be thrown toward them, that it may not find 
them asleep and go by uncaught. 
2. Teach the girls to throw correctly. The profes- 
sional baseball pitcher, if he throws with his right hand, 
stands with his left foot forward. As he throws he leans 
forward, shifting his body to his left foot, and puts the 
whole weight of his body behind the swing of his arm. 
Right-handed girls should not put the right foot forward 
when they try to throw. When they stand correctly 
they soon learn to throw nearly as well as boys. 
3. There is an excellent opportunity in this game to 
develop originality and skill in trying to get the better 
of the other fellow both in throwing and in dodging. 
4. The teacher should see that the circle is constantly 
maintained at the proper size. 
5. No player should throw at the player “‘in-center”’ 
except while on the circle. i 
Long Ball.—Played with indoor baseball. : Equipment 
needed: A light baseball bat, two bases easily made by 
stuffing sacks with excelsior or hay, and tying, mattress 
fashion. Place the bases from thirty to sixty feet apart, 
depending on the size and the skill of the players. All 
of the pupils may play. 
Divide the players into two equal groups. Number
-P-A-G-E-241
         PHYSICAL EDUCATION 223 
the players in each group 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. One team takes 
turn at bat; the other team takes the field. The team 
taking the field selects a pitcher, who stands half way 
between home plate and second base. He pitches the 
ball—ALWAYS UNDERHAND—+to the catcher, who 
stands immediately behind the home base. The remain- 
ing players of the side taking the field arrange them- 
selves in an elongated semicircle about the field. Play- 
ers of the side at bat come up to bat in order of their 
numbers, beginning each inning after the first with the 
player whose number follows the number of the player 
who made the third out of the previous inning. 
The batter stands on EITHER SIDE of the home 
base (not ON the base) as is most convenient in batting 
the ball. 
There are no fouls in this game. Every time the bat- 
ter, standing in his position, touches the pitched ball 
with the bat, the batter attempts to run to the base, 
and, if possible, returns to the home base. 
The base runner may take any path he chooses in 
running to and from second base. 
More than one base runner may remain on second base 
at the same time. 
A pitched ball is considered a strike if it passes over 
the home base while the batter is in position, provided 
that the ball passes the batter at an elevation not above 
his shoulder nor below his knees. 
If the catcher catches a third strike, the batter is out. 
If a third strike is not caught, the batter becomes a base 
runner. 
A pitched ball which does not pass over home base, or 
higher than the shoulders or lower than the knees of the 
batter, and is not struck at by him, is called a ball. 
  
-P-A-G-E-242
  224 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
Four balls entitle the batter to take his place on second 
base. 
After the batter becomes a base runner he may be put 
out in the following ways: 
1. By catching the ball he batted before it touches 
the ground. 
2. By being hit by a thrown ball while attempting to 
run to, or return from, second base. 
3. By being touched by the ball in the hands of an 
opposing player while running to, or returning from, 
second base. 
4. By being struck by a batted ball. The return of a 
runner to home. base after touching second base counts 
one score for his team. 
More than one player may return home from second 
base at the same time. 
No player may score on the play which results in the 
third out. 
After three outs the teams exchange positions. 
Nine innings constitute a game. Number ones may 
decide at the opening of the game on some other num- 
ber of innings that is to constitute a game. 
Points to emphasize in teaching the game of long ball: 
1. Diagram the position of the various players on the 
blackboard and explain the duties of each before at- 
tempting to play the game out-of-doors. 
2. Pitching must be done underhand. Catcher and 
fielders may throw overhanded. 
3. By requiring the team in the field to take positions 
for the first inning as numbered on the diagram, i. e., 
No. 1 pitcher, No. 2 catcher, No. 3 fielder, etc., and to 
move up to the position having the next higher number 
each succeeding inning, interest in the game will be
-P-A-G-E-243
  PHYSICAL EDUCATION 225 
greatly increased, as each player will have an oppor- 
tunity to play every position, and no player can selfishly 
continue to hold one of the better positions. 
4. Any additional number of players necessary to ac- 
commodate the pupils of the school may be added to the 
semicircle of fielders. 
5. Some one should be chosen to act as umpire, giv- 
ing decisions on balls, strikes, outs, and necessary inter- 
pretations of the rules. 
Indoor Baseball.—Played out-of-doors. Seven to nine 
players on a side. Equipment same as for long ball, 
with the addition of first and third bases. Playing field 
is a square, set cornerwise. The side of the square is 
about thirty feet. The exact distance depends on the 
size and skill of the players. 
With the exception that a ball batted outside of the 
first or third base lines is a foul, the pitching and batting 
rules are the same as for long ball. A caught ball puts 
the batter out. 
The manner of making put-outs is the same as for 
long ball, with the exception that a player may not be 
put out by being struck by a thrown ball. 
Teams change positions after three outs, the same as 
in long bail. 
Base runners in order to score must keep to the path 
between bases and touch all four bases in succession. 
But one runner may remain on the same base at the 
same time. The runner who batted last is entitled to 
first base, if he can reach it safely. The base runner 
ahead of him must move on if forced. 
Select an umpire as in long ball. 
Unless a different number of innings is agreed upon, 
nine will constitute a game. 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
  226 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
Points to be emphasized in teaching indoor baseball: 
1. Pitching is underhand. 
2. Players bat in order of their numbers. 
3. Shifting the players in the field into different posi- 
tions each inning gives equal opportunity to all. 
4. Keeping a player in the same position develops 
skill in playing that position. 
5. The size of the playing field must be adapted to the 
available playground space and to the size and skill of 
the players. 
6. The girls should be taught to throw correctly. 
(See dodge ball, above.) 
7. If two of the best players are asked to ‘‘choose up” 
in selecting the teams to play indoor baseball, spice of 
contest is added. 
Arch Ball.—May be played in the schoolhouse or out- 
of-doors. 
Equipment: Two or three indoor baseballs, depending 
on the size of the school. 
Divide the players into two or three equal groups, de- 
pending on the number. 
Players in each group stand in column at convenient 
distances from each other. 
The columns are placed parallel to each other, facing 
in the same direction. 
Each leader holds an indoor baseball in both hands, 
extended above the head. At a given signal the ball is 
passed backward with both hands. The next player re- 
ceives the ball with both hands and passes it backward 
over his head in the same fashion. The last player in 
the column to receive the ball runs to the head of the 
column as each player in the column takes one long 
step backward. This is continued until the leader of
-P-A-G-E-245
     PHYSICAL EDUCATION 227 
one column returns to the head of the column again. 
This column is then declared winner. Much animation 
is displayed in this game. 
Note: This is a splendid corrective exercise, provided 
that the ball is passed backward over the head with 
both hands, with the arms extended as far as possi- 
ble. 
If the umpire should detect any player passing the 
ball otherwise than backward overhead with both hands, 
the ball should be brought back and started again at the 
head of the column. Emphasize this point when first 
teaching the game. Insist on it. 4 
Volley Ball.*—Played out-of-doors. All the pupils 
may play. 
Equipment: One volley ball, a light inflated rubber 
ball with a leather cover; one net, two feet wide and from 
twenty to twenty-four feet long. These may be ordered 
through the local dealer in athletic goods or purchased 
directly from catalog houses. The ball will cost from 
three dollars to eight dollars, depending on quality. 
The net costs one dollar to three dollars. Nets may be 
made as part of the manual training work. 
The ball and the net should be purchased out of the 
school funds and become a part of the play equipment 
belonging to the district. 
Stretch the net horizontally so that the top will be 
about one foot higher than the head of the tallest player. 
Lay off a square court on each side of the net 
(20 x 20). To mark the boundaries of each court, dig a 
small trench and fill it with ashes or sand, or pin pieces 
of white cardboard at the corners of the square. 
* Instructor must draw diagram on blackboard to explain this game. 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
    
228 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
Divide the players into two teams. Arrange the 
players on each team on their respective courts, facing 
the net, as shown by numbered positions on the 
courts. ; 
If team (A) is to serve the ball first, the player stand- 
ing in position (1) passes to the point (X), near the mid- 
dle of the back row, to serve. At the same time players 
in front row shift one position to the left; a player in 
the second row steps forward into the vacant position 
in front row; the players in second row shift one position 
to the right, a player from the third row filling the 
vacancy. The players in the third row shift one place 
to the left. When the player finishes serving, he takes 
the last position in the back row. 
A shift like this is made by a team every time its 
player from position (1) is called to serve the ball. This 
gives each player a chance to play every position... This 
feature adds greatly to the fairness and interest of the 
game. 
The player serving tosses the ball into the air with 
one hand and bats it over the net with the other. The 
served ball must not strike outside the bounds of the 
opponents’ court. One trial is allowed to server. If he 
fails, the ball passes to the opponents, and number (1) 
on that team serves the ball. 
When the ball is served over the net within bounds, 
the opponents try to bat it back over the net by striking 
it with the open hand. If they fail, and the ball touches 
the ground, the team serving the ball scores one point. 
The same player continues to serve as long as he con- 
tinues to score. 
Should the opponents bat the ball back over the net 
so that it touches the ground within bounds of the
-P-A-G-E-247
     PHYSICAL EDUCATION 229 
server’s court, the side serving loses the ball, and the 
other team serves. Only the team which is serving the 
ball can score. 
The members of each team attempt to keep the ball 
in the air by striking it with the open hand while it is 
on their side of the net, and to drive it to some point on 
their opponents’ court where it may most readily touch 
the ground. 
Each player is free to move about in his position, to 
face either way, and to strike the ball with one or both 
hands. 
Striking the ball with the closed fist or catching the 
ball forfeits the game to the other team. 
Should the members of either team (when serving) 
strike the ball out of bounds, the ball passes to the other 
team to serve. 
A score is counted when the ball is struck out of 
bounds by an opponent of the server. 
Pass the Hoop.—Equipment: Two or more ordinary 
wooden hoops wound with cloth. May be played inside 
or out-of-doors. 
Divide the players ‘into two or more equal groups. 
Arrange in parallel columns as for arch ball. 
The leader of each column holds a hoop in the left 
hand above the head, and the right arm close to body. 
At a given signal the hoop is slipped down over the 
body with the left hand alone. The player steps out of 
the hoop without allowing it to touch the floor. He 
then passes it backward over the head with the left hand 
to the next player behind him, who receives it in the 
left hand. The last player in the column to receive the 
hoop runs to the head of the column and passes himself 
through the hoop as described above. When the leader  
-P-A-G-E-248
230 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
of one column returns to the head of the column, his 
column is declared winner. 
Note: Insist that the players do not touch the hoop 
with the right hand and that the hoop be not permitted 
to touch the floor. If a player violates either of these 
rules, he must pass himself through the hoop again. 
This game may be varied by passing the hoop with 
the right hand instead of the left, or by placing a column 
of boys in competition with a column of girls and requir- 
ing the boys to pass the hoops over their feet up- 
ward, while the girls pass the hoop over the head down- 
ward. 
Black and White.—Equipment: A piece of tin, or card- 
board about three inches square, colored black on one 
side and white on the other. 
Divide the players into two nearly equal groups. 
Name one group the blacks and the other the whites. 
Arrange two parallel goal lines facing each other 
about sixty feet apart. Assign one goal to the blacks 
and the other to the whites. 
The umpire stands half-way between the goals. The 
blacks and whites advance in parallel lines until the dis- 
tance between the lines can just be spanned by the out- 
stretched arms of the umpire. 
The umpire tosses the black-and-white disc into the 
air so that it will fall between the lines. 
If the black side comes up, the blacks run to their 
goal and the whites chase them. All black players 
touched before reaching their goal by any player of the 
whites must go on to the white side when the sides ad- 
vance for the next try. 
Should the white side of the disc come up the proce- 
dure is reversed.
-P-A-G-E-249
  PHYSICAL EDUCATION ? 231 
The game continues until one side has taken all the 
players from the other. 
Note: This is an excellent game to develop alertness 
in the pupils and shorten their reaction time. 
All- Up-Relay.—Select a level place on the play- 
ground. Draw two circles on the ground, each eighteen 
inches in diameter and six inches apart. Ten feet away 
draw two more circles the same as above. Twenty feet 
from each pair of circles draw a base line. 
Divide players into two groups as nearly equal in 
playing ability as possible. It adds interest to appoint 
leaders and let them choose sides. 
‘Each leader stands behind the base line facing his 
pair of circles. The remaining members of his team 
stand behind the leader in single file. 
Three sticks of stove wood, each one foot long and 
about three inches in diameter, with ends sawed off 
squarely are placed on end in one of the circles before 
each team. 
At a given signal the leader of each team runs for- 
ward, takes the sticks from one circle, places them on 
end in the other circle, and runs back to ‘touch off” 
the person heading the column, who has moved up to 
the base line. 
Upon being “touched off” each runner in succession 
places the sticks in the other circle, and after “touching 
off”? the runner who follows him, he takes his place back 
of the base line in such a position as not to interfere 
with the runners. 
The team wins which first succeeds in getting all its 
runners back over the base line. 
Note: See that the surface of the ground within the 
circles is level and smooth. 
 
-P-A-G-E-250
232 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
Should the sticks fall down, the player who placed 
them must stand them up again and return across the 
base line before the next player following him may cross 
the base line. 
InpooR GAMES 
The teacher will need some good indoor “bad weather”’ 
games. While many games might be given, the follow- 
ing, which have been tried and found to be very good, 
are suggested. 
The beginning teacher may consider that such games 
will be too noisy for the schoolroom. It is true that 
noisy, boisterous actions ought to be prohibited in the 
schoolroom, but if the teacher supervises these games, 
if the windows are opened, and the children understand 
that the playing is a special privilege, because of weather 
conditions, they will usually co-operate admirably. 
Care must be taken, of course, to select games that will 
not tend to destroy property. It is an excellent place 
for the teacher and pupils to practise self-control. 
I Say Stroop 
Description: Class stands before seats in schoolroom. 
Teacher or leader is in front of class. Teacher says 
quickly: “I say stoop!” She immediately stoops (a 
sort of courtesy), and rises again. If teacher says: “I 
say stand!” at the same time stooping herself, the play- 
ers should remain standing. ‘The class must do as the 
teacher says, not as she does. Any one making a mis- 
take must sit down. 
 
-P-A-G-E-251
  PHYSICAL EDUCATION 233 
BASKETBALL No. 1 
(Schoolroom or playground) 
Material: Bean-bags or indoor baseballs. 
Description: Have equal number of pupils in each 
row. Mark off a starting line, with chalk, side of front 
row of desks; another several feet nearer the front wall. 
One child in each line is chosen as basket, and stands 
back of line with arms held shoulder high in front, 
forming a circle. At a signal first pupil rises and toes 
starting line, throws ball into living basket, runs and 
gets ball, and passes it, after having seated himself, to 
next child behind, who immediately rises and runs to 
line and throws, etc. Each “basket” made scores two 
points a row, and the row which gets through first scores 
five points. 
Cat AND MICE 
(Schoolroom) 
Description: One player chosen to be cat hides behind 
or under teacher’s desk or a chair. (Suggestion: Select 
one who has done particularly good work.) After cat 
is hidden, teacher beckons to five or six other players, 
who creep softly up to the desk or chair, and, when all 
are assembled, scratch on it with their fingers, to rep- 
resent nibbling of mice, who save themselves only by 
getting back to their holes (seats). If a mouse is caught, 
the cat changes place with him for the next round. If 
no mouse can be caught, the same cat may continue, 
or the teacher may at her own discretion choose another. 
Choose different mice each time. Have mice take long 
routes to seats to add sport to game and to give the cat 
a chance.
-P-A-G-E-252
  234 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
Brrp-CATCHER 
(Schoolroom—Playground) 
Description: Two opposite corners are marked off 
at one end of ground or room; one for the nest for the 
birds and the other as a cage. Mother bird is chosen, 
who takes her position in the nest. Two other players 
take the parts of bitd-catchers and stand midway be- 
tween nest and cage. Rest of players in seats, if in a 
schoolroom; or beyond the line at farther end of ground, 
called a forest, if outdoors. All these players should 
be named for birds. A row, if in a schoolroom, or a 
small group if outdoors, may be named for some bird. 
Ii inside, have the players change places so that all the 
sparrows or all the bluebirds will not fly from same lo- 
cality. Mother bird calls the name of a bird, and then 
the players bearing that name run from forest to nest. 
The bird-catchers try to intercept them. If a bird is 
caught, it is put in the cage; but a bird is safe if it 
reaches the nest. To make the game more interesting, 
have birds dodge and take circuitous routes to the nest. 
BLACKBOARD RELAY RACE 
(Schoolroom) 
Description: Have an even number in each row. A 
piece of chalk is given to the last player in each row, all 
of whom at a given signal run forward and write on 
blackboard at front of room a word suitable to begin a 
sentence, a number, or whatever the teacher designates. 
Each returns at once to seat, handing chalk to next 
player, who at once runs forward and writes a word 
after the first one, to which it must bear a suitable re- 
lation, or answer, etc. The last player must end the 
 
-P-A-G-E-253
PHYSICAL EDUCATION 235 
sentence and punctuate, etc. Score 25 points to row 
returning first, 25 points for spelling, 25 points for writ- 
ing, 25 points for grammatical construction, capitaliza- 
tion, and punctuation, or similarly for any other desig- 
nated task. 
AUTOMOBILE RACE 
(Schoolroom or Playground) 
Description: Have even numbers of players in each 
row. Have each row name itself for a make of auto- 
mobile. Number rows, and every other row plays. At 
a signal the first one in even rows rises to right, runs 
around front of his desk, up other aisle to back, and 
down right side to his seat. As soon as he is seated, 
the next one rises at right, runs around front of desk, 
and up the aisle, etc. The row whose last player is 
seated first wins. Next the odd rows play, and finally 
the two winning rows play to see which is the winning 
car. 
This game may be played outdoors by having play- 
ers sit on ground with wide space between rows, thus 
allowing all rows to play at once. 
SQUIRREL AND NuT 
(Schoolroom) 
10 to 60 players. 
All the pupils but one sit at their desks with heads 
bowed on the arms as though sleeping, but each with a 
hand outstretched. The odd player, who is the squirrel, 
and carries a nut, runs on tip-toe up and down through 
the aisles, and at his own discretion drops the nut into 
one of the waiting hands. The player who gets the 
nut at once jumps up from his seat and chases the 
squirrel, who is safe only when he reaches his seat. 
   
-P-A-G-E-254
236 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
Should the squirrel get caught before he reaches his 
nest (seat), he must be squirrel the second time. 
It is scarcely necessary to say that the other players 
wake up to watch the chase. 
TaG THE WALL RELAY 
(Schoolroom) 
to to 60 players. 
The players should all be seated, an even number 
in each row of seats. At a signal the last player in 
each line runs forward and tags the front wall. As 
soon as this player is out of the aisle, the other players 
all move backward one seat. This leaves the front 
seat vacant, and the runner having touched the wall, 
returns immediately and takes this vacant front seat. 
As the player sits, he raises his hand as a signal for the 
player who is now the last one in the line to run for- 
ward, the line moving backward one place as soon as 
he is out of the aisle. He, in turn, having touched the 
wall, takes the vacant front seat. The play is con- 
tinued in this way until every one in the row has run. 
The line wins whose player, sitting at the start in the 
front seat, first returns to his seat. 
As in all schoolroom games where there is running, 
the seated players should be very careful to keep their 
feet under the desks that there may be nothing in the 
aisles to ‘trip the runners. 
ArcH BALL 
(Schoolroom) 
Io to 100 players. 
The players raise their seats where this is possible, 
and stand between the desk and the seat. Where the
-P-A-G-E-255
      
     
   
               
     PHYSICAL EDUCATION 237 
seats cannot be raised, the players may sit in the seats 
or on the desks. An even number of players should be 
in each line, and only alternate lines play simultaneously, 
so as to leave clear the necessary aisle space for running. 
Those at the front of the lines should hold a ball or 
any substitute for passing backward over the head, 
such as a bean-bag, eraser, foot-rule, or a book. Ata 
given signal the object is passed backward over the 
head to the next player, who in turn passes it backward, 
and so on down the line until the last player receives it. 
He runs forward on the right-hand side of his desk to 
the first seat. At the same time the other players in 
his row step into the aisle at the left of the desks and 
move backward one place. The line wins whose original 
leader first gets back to the front.

Gas ball. 
The players are evenly divided into two teams. One 
team takes its place around the outer edge of the room; 
the players of the other team scatter through the aisles 
or seats, which lattereshould be turned up if possible. 
The outer team tries to hit the inner team with the ball. 
Any player who is hit takes his place in the outer team 
and joins in its play. The player who remains longest 
in the center has won. 
Only a hit from the ball on the fly counts. A hit 
from a bounce does not put a player out. A “hit” is 
made when a ball touches any part of the clothing or 
person. If two players are hit by the same throw, only 
the first one hit is considered out. Players may dodge
-P-A-G-E-256
   
       238 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
the ball in any way. Should the ball be out of reach 
of any player of the circle team, it is returned to the 
circle players by a toss from one of the inner team 
If desired, the hit players may leave the game in- 
stead of joining the outer circle. This leaves the teams 
intact, and each then keeps a separate score. 
If successive games are played, the teams change 
places, the inner players going to the circle, and vice 
versa. The game may then be played in innings, if de- 
sired, each team to be given three minutes in the circle. 
One point is then scored against a team for every player 
hit, and the team wins which has the smallest score at 
the end.

  CHAPTER XIT 
PHYSICAL EDUCATION 
(CONTINUED) 
Teachers must teach physical training. This edict 
has been made a law in many States. The investiga- 
tions of physicians, educators, and social workers have 
revealed a need of physical awakening in this country. 
In the preceding chapter emphasis has been placed upon 
contest games. This chapter calls attention to other 
means of developing interest in physical efficiency and 
suggests definite plans for a physical education program. 
ATHLETIC EFFICIENCY TESTS 
Efficiency tests adapted from Brown’s Outdoor Athletic 
Tests for Boys, published by Association Press, 124 East 
28th Street, New York, have been used in several County 
Play Days in Iowa and other States. These have 
proved very satisfactory, and are given here because we 
feel that rural boys and girls need just such exercises. 
Although it is not necessary to use these tests just as 
they are outlined below, the complete plan is given here 
for those who might wish to use it. If the scheme for 
scoring seems to be difficult, do not use it at first; 
simply tell the children that distance and time in the 
first column (the column labeled o points) ought to be 
easily attained by any healthy child, and then have them 
attempt to go beyond this standard.

Explanation of Methods of Classification —Every boy 
is classified according to his weight. No boy weighing 
less than 60 pounds should be allowed to compete. 
Each contestant should be physically fit. This is de- 
termined on examination by a local physician or school 
nurse, who certifies regarding each scholar who enters 
the test. A weight class consists of all the boys in a 
school whose weights aré within the limits designated. 
If a boy weighs one-half pound more than the highest 
limit of a class, he belongs to the class above; for exam-

242 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
Every girl is classified according to her age. An age 
class consists of all the girls in a school whose ages fall 
within the limits designated. If a girl is ten years and 
one month old, she belongs to the 10-12 year class. 
The health certificate should be required for all girls 
participating, as for all boys. 
To illustrate how to work out the points for a child 
who is endeavoring to go beyond the o points. For 
example, an 8-year-old girl runs in the potato race and 
completes it in 28 seconds. Since this time is 2 seconds 
less than 30, or the o point column, she would make 20 
points, because 10 points are given for each second less 
than the o point time. Now, if this child were to keep 
practising at this event for some time she would be- 
come efficient enough, perhaps, to complete the same 
event in 20 seconds, which is 10 better than the o column, 
and would give her 100 points. 
An 8-year-old girl attempts the standing broad jump, 
and jumps 4 feet 2 inches. The o point column shows 
3 feet 3 inches, or 39 inches, as the minimum distance. 
This child has jumped 50 inches, or 11 inches better 
than the minimum, and should receive 55 points. 
Equipment.—Watch (stop watch preferred), spade, 
rake, jumping pit, jumping standards, cross-bar, base- 
ball, four 2-inch wooden cubes, two paper boxes about 
a foot square and 8 inches deep, tape line 50 to 75 feet 
long. 
DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING EQUIPMENT 
Jumping Pit.—Spade up a space 15 or 16 feet long 
and 3 feet wide. Smooth it over with a rake. A 
piece of wood 8 inches wide should be sunk level with 
the ground as the take-off at one end of the pit. 
 
-P-A-G-E-261
  PHYSICAL EDUCATION 243 
Jumping Standards—Uprights may be made of 2 
by 3 inch sticks 6 feet in height. Beginning 2 feet 
above the ground, the holes are bored 1 inch apart. 
The uprights should be placed on the ground 9g to 12 
feet apart. The cross-bar should be 1 inch square 
and 14 feet in length. A bamboo fishing-rod may be 
used for the cross-bar. This bar rests on 5-inch spikes 
placed through the holes of the uprights. Ten-inch 
square bases, made of 2-inch material, should support 
the uprights. 
How to Conpuct Events 
Dashes.—Mark off a starting line, then measure from 
this line the varying distances to be run in your school, 
i.€., 50 yards, 75 yards, and. 1oo yards. If stakes are 
placed in the ground to mark these distances, they will 
not need to be measured each time. Since the ‘“‘start”’ 
of a dash position is so important this should be thor- 
oughly taught first. The crouching position is most 
popular and effective. The front foot is placed about 
6 inches behind the line, the rear foot is placed so that 
when kneeling the knee is opposite the instep of the 
front foot. When the starter says “Get on your 
marks,” the boy kneels on the knee of his rear leg and 
places his hands just back of the line. On the com- 
mand “Get set,” this knee is raised and straightened 
slightly, and the body is pushed forward, keeping the 
back flat. On the word “Go,” the boy springs forward 
with three or four short quick steps, keeping the body 
well forward until he has run several feet. A clap of 
the hands or of two boards may be substituted for the 
word “Go.” Should a boy start before this signal he 
should be brought back and told that this is a foul, 
 
-P-A-G-E-262
    
244 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
with a penalty of being set back 1 yard for the first 
offense, and 2 yards for the second, with disqualifica- 
tion for the third offense. Carelessness in this respect 
may cost him the race in a regular meet. Each boy 
should be coached to keep going at top speed until the 
finish line for his race is crossed and, if a string is held 
at the finish, not to touch this with his hands. In de- 
termining the individual times in the various weight 
classes only one boy’s time can be taken at one time; 
but it is much better to have one or more boys run with 
him, as few boys run their fastest when running alone. 
For example, you wish to see how fast John can run 75 
yards. You ask James to run with him, and ask some 
other boy to act as starter. You stand at the finish 
line, watch in hand, and when the starter says “Go” 
he throws up one arm, and you start your watch. When 
John crosses the finish line you stop your watch, even 
though James may have crossed it sooner. 
Running High Jump.—The bar is placed at the lower 
limit of the weight class, and is raised one inch at a 
time. Each boy is allowed three jumps at each suc- 
cessive height, and takes his jump in turn. Those who 
fail on their first trial take their second trial in turn, 
and those who fail on their second trial take their third 
in proper order. When a boy fails on his third trial at 
any height, he is declared out of the test and is given 
credit for the last height which he cleared. Knocking 
down the bar is counted as a trial. Running under the 
bar is a “‘balk.”” Three balks are counted as one trial. 
The boy may run any distance and from any direction 
before making his jump, but he should be encouraged 
to shorten his distance, as this allows more spring into 
the air.
-P-A-G-E-263
  PHYSICAL EDUCATION 245 
Running Broad Jump.—A board 8 inches wide is 
sunk level with the ground at the near end of the jump- 
ing pit, and a runway of not less than 100 feet should 
be allowed leading to this pit. The boy should practise 
his run so he will land on the same foot on the take-off 
board each time. He should be encouraged to draw his 
knees well up after he takes off, and jump high as well 
as broad. He lands on both feet, and as he does so’ 
throws both arms forward and up so his body will fall 
forward. The measure of the jump is taken from the 
edge of the take-off board to the last mark he leaves 
on the pit. If he falls backward or lets his hand fall 
behind him the measurement is taken to here, but if he 
falls forward and his feet are his last marks, the measure- 
ment is taken to the back of the heel mark of the foot- 
print nearest the take-off board. Should the boy over- 
step the take-off board as his toe touches the ground 
beyond it, this is a foul and counts as one trial. Each 
boy has three trials, and the best jump out of the 
three is recorded. The ground should be kept soft 
and level after each jump so there will be no mistakes 
about foot-prints and so there will be no sprained _ 
ankles. 
Standing Broad Jump.—This is conducted much the 
same as the running broad jump, although if the ground 
is reasonably soft no pit is necessary. The girl stands 
with her toes on a line with the forward edge of the 
take-off board, or behind a line drawn on the ground. 
After alternately rising on her toes and bending her 
knees, she’ throws her arms forward quickly and jumps 
forward with both feet at once. To get a good jump 
she must bend her knees well up in front while she is in 
the air, and land with her weight forward, as in the
-P-A-G-E-264
  246 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
running broad jump. Measurements are taken as in 
the running broad jump. 
Baseball Throw.—A line is marked on the ground 
back of which the thrower must stand. He is given 
three trials, and his best throw is recorded. Should he 
step over the line on any throw it is a foul and counts 
as a trial without any measure being taken. It will 
save much time and trouble in measuring if some per- 
manent stakes are driven in the ground at varying in- 
tervals from the throwing line, say 70 feet, 150 feet, etc.; 
then the individual throw may be measured from these 
stakes, provided the throw has been made in line with 
the stakes. 
Potato Race.—A starting line is drawn and the~boxes 
mentioned under equipment are placed on this line. 
For the 224-foot test the first potato (or block of wood) 
is placed 24 feet from the box, and the second 32 feet 
from the box and in line with the first potato. The 
spots where the potatoes lie should be marked by some- 
thing that is easily seen, chalk-dust line or paper fast- 
ened down. For the 304-foot test the first potato is 
34 feet out, and the second 42 feet from the box. In 
the race the runner stands back of the starting line, and 
at a signal to go she runs out and brings in one potato 
and drops it in the box. She runs out and brings in 
the second, touches the box with it, and replaces it on 
the mark, comes back, takes the first one out of the 
box, replaces it on the mark, and returns to the starting 
line. Failure to drop block in box or place it on the 
mark constitutes a foul, for which the runner has one 
second added to her time. As in the dashes, the person 
being timed should have some one running against her 
so she will do her best. She should keep up her speed
-P-A-G-E-265
    PHYSICAL EDUCATION 247 
until she has crossed the starting line after replacing 
the blocks on the marks. 
Explanation of Point System.—Every boy and girl is 
expected to train for and participate in all the events 
in his weight or age class. In this way he can raise his 
own individual standing and at the same time raise the 
standing of his weight class and his school. 
If you will look at the table of events for each weight 
and age class for both boys and girls, you will note that 
for the first distance and time given no points are scored, 
but that points are given for each inch jumped in height, 
or each second in time deducted from the running time. 
These points should be tabulated by each pupil as he 
earns them, and when he succeeds in getting 50 points 
in any event he may consider himself an average per- 
former in that event. Should he get 50 points in each 
event, he is considered an honor pupil in his weight 
class, and he may consider himself having the same aver- 
age standing as any other boy in any other weight class 
with the same number of points. 
CorRECT POSTURE 
“Posture denotes the habitual carriage of the body, 
especially in the erect position. It involves the correct 
development and contours of spine, chest, shoulders, and 
other main segments as well as their relation to each 
other in the upright position.”’* 
Importance of Good Posture-—Erect posture is neces- 
sary to full vigor and health. Only when the body is 
erect and standing at its fullest height are the great 
functioning organs of the trunk able to perform their 
* Jessie Bancroft.
-P-A-G-E-266
  248 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
work to the best advantage. When the shoulders are 
thrown back in the proper position it gives a greater 
breadth to the lung capacity, and as the shoulders are 
placed in this position the sternum is raised. This in- 
creases the depth of the lung capacity, or the distance 
measured from the middle of the chest to the back. 
With this increase in depth and width much more room 
is given for lung and heart growth. Growth and 
strength of these organs means a strong, vigorous body. 
As the body grows and attains its full stature of man- 
hood or womanhood it will be able to cope with disease 
and old age with wonderful efficiency. An erect body 
not only means a greater capacity for the lungs and 
heart, but it means that the diaphragm will be lifted 
as the sternum proceeds upward, and a greater capacity 
. will be given to the liver, stomach, and other viscera 
that function in digestion and elimination. 
The expenditure of nervous energy and muscular 
effort to maintain an incorrect standing position is 
greater than that necessary for a good standing position. 
The natural human body is an upright column, broken, 
however, at many points with joints and vertebre divi- 
sions. Around each of these joints or segments are nu- 
merous ligaments and muscles that tend to maintain 
these sections and segments, one upon the other, in a 
normal position. In a perfectly poised standing posi- 
tion there is practically no stress or strain experienced. 
On the other hand, a poor position tends to strain cer- 
tain muscles and ligaments too much, causing fatigue. 
How important it is, then, to begin habits of good pos- 
ture early in a child’s life. 
Growing children need especial attention to posture 
habits, not alone because of the formation of such habit-
-P-A-G-E-267
  PHYSICAL EDUCATION 249 
ual positions, but because they must use their powers 
of respiration, digestion, and elimination for growth, as 
well as for daily repair and usage of the body. This 
indicates that very careful attention must be given to 
the maintenance of the erect posture during all activi- 
ties. When the child walks, plays, stands in the class- 
room, or takes part in any other activity he should 
maintain a good posture. 
Interesting Children in Posture.—Correct posture can- 
not be secured through lecturing, courses of gymnastics, 
or admonishing children to “‘sit up,” “bring your shoul- 
ders back.” It must be brought about through inter- 
est. They must want to stand erect. There must be 
some immediate reward. There must be some idea of 
contest, in which the child is competing against a stan- 
dard. One method of interesting children is by asking 
them to keep their eyes open for pictures of people who 
they think show good posture. These can be found in 
magazines, newspapers, and their text-books. - If the pic- 
tures could be placed before the pupils and discussion 
given about their good points, ideals would gradually 
begin to form. 
Charts showing good positions can be secured from 
the Posture Standards Company, 1 Madison Avenue, 
New York, N. Y., and these can be placed in the school- 
room. An actual straight edge or plumb line equip- 
ment can be used to test erect posture. These methods 
and many others might be used to motivate good pos- 
ture. 
Another means of securing interest through: the idea 
of contest, and measuring up to a standard, is the triple 
test. This test has been used with success in many sec- 
ondary schools. It has been used with excellent results 
 
-P-A-G-E-268
250 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
in the Iowa State Teachers’ College Training School, 
and has been given to many thousand prospective teach- 
ers who have taken college courses in physical training. 
The triple test is a success because it embraces the game, 
the attempt to meet certain standards, and is not diffi- 
cult to supervise or administer from the teacher’s stand- 
point. The triple test is based upon the relation of the 
erect human body to a vertical line. If the body is 
standing perfectly erect the long axes of the trunk, head, 
and neck form a vertical line. This constitutes the 
vertical-line test. To assist the eye a plumb line or 
window pole may be used to determine the correctness 
of the posture. The pole will pass the head and face 
just in front of the ear, pass the tip of the shoulder just 
in front of its middle, and strike the floor at or just 
back of the ball of the foot. (See picture.) The pole, 
if perpendicular to the earth, is a vertical line, and if the 
axes of the head, neck, and trunk coincide with the pole, 
the body is in the correct position. 
If the vertical-line test is understood it is not difficult 
to administer the triple test. 
The triple test is conducted as follows: 
Standing Test.—The teacher asks one row of pupils 
to come to the front of the room and face with their 
sides toward the rest of the class. She, with the rest of 
the pupils (after having trained their judgment by the 
use of the plumb line), determines quickly which pupils 
fulfill the requirements of the vertical-line test. Those 
who pass this test go to the seats set apart for those 
who pass, and those who fail take certain seats desig- 
nated for those failing. This continues until all have 
been tested and those passing have been sorted from 
those who fail.

-P-A-G-E-270
  252 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
Marching Test.—All pupils are now asked to stand at 
the right hand side of their desks (if the seats open to 
the right), and the alternate rows face the back of the 
room. The leader, who is standing at the front of the ° 
first row, leads her line across the front of the room, and 
all other rows follow, marching in the part of the room 
between them and the first row. The leader follows 
the path of the last person in the last row, and thus leads 
the children up and down the aisles of the schoolroom. 
During this marching, which should last several min- 
utes, the teacher watches those who passed the stand- 
ing test to see if they can continue to hold their good 
posture while becoming somewhat fatigued by march- 
ing. If they lose this posture at any time they are 
asked to step back and march with those who failed in 
the first test. During the marching those who failed 
are trying to correct the faults pointed out to them as 
the cause of their failure. 
Exercise Test—The pupils who have passed the 
standing and marching tests successfully are then put 
through the third test, which is to determine how well 
they can maintain the proper poise of body when exe- 
cuting certain exercises through a period of five or ten 
minutes. (See following pages.) As these exercises 
continue the teacher will detect poor posture in certain 
pupils, drooping heads, the upper part of the chest or 
trunk sinking backward. Pupils exhibiting these signs 
would not pass the last test and should be asked to sit 
down as soon as they are detected. 
The following exercise for the third test has been 
used with success. Many more might be given if space| 
permitted. Any good exercise where arms and trun 
muscles must be used is good.

ForMAL GYMNASTICS 
Gymnastics which are performed in response to com- 
mands given by teachers and instructors are known as 
formal gymnastics. 
Any formal drill or gymnastic lesson in which pupils 
must respond in unison and meet certain requirements 
has three important aims: 
(1) The correlation of mind and muscle so that the 
body will respond quickly when the mind sends a mes- 
sage to the muscles. 
(2) The correction of posture habits during the exe- 
cution of gymnastic movements, thus fixing better 
habits. 
(3) The production of vigorous breathing and quick- 
ened circulation because of repeated contractions of 
large muscles. 
 
-P-A-G-E-272
  254 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
The following exercises are excellent for the teacher 
to use to discover the pupils who do not keep good pos- 
ture through the period of execution. 
Exercise I—Arm Exercise. Arms forward in a hori- 
zontal position and then placed at sides again in the 
cadence or rhythm of One, Two. At the command 
“Arm Exercise,” which is the cautionary command, the 
pupils take a good standing position. At command . 
“One,” arms are brought up to a horizontal position 
level with shoulder and with precision. At ‘“Two” 
they are dropped smartly to the side. Repeat with 8 
counts in the rhythm One, Two, etc. 
Teacher must watch for faulty positions as the exer- 
cise proceeds. The body should retain its original ver- 
tical line posture throughout the exercise. 
Exercise II.— Knee-Bending. Wandsonhips. Place! 
Knee-bending with heels off the floor. Down! Up! 
At “One” the heels are raised at the same time that 
knees are bent. Knees should point slightly outward, 
and the back should be erect. At “Two” the body re- 
turns to the erect position. Repeat this through 6 
counts. Down! Up! Etc. 
Exercise ITI.—Rotary Arm Movement. Arms upward. 
Raise! Rotary motion of extended right arm forward 
and back to original position, through 3 counts. Same 
with left arm through 3 counts. Both arms through 3 
counts.

In order to add interest for the children and to give 
them and the teacher standards of attainment, the fol- 
lowing plan is suggested:

    tests successfully are given a mark of “A.” Those who 
pass the first two are given a mark of “B.” Those who 
pass the first test are given a “C.” Those who do not 
pass any of the tests are given “D.” If the teacher will 
give these tests every month, record the results, watch 
individual pupils that need help, encourage and keep

up a keen interest in posture, much can be accomplished 
toward improving the physique of the children. 
Sincinc GAMES AND RuytTHmic Ptays. 
The following singing games, flag drills, and rhythmic 
plays have been included as a part of the work in physi- 
cal education for rural schools because: 
(t) Children need to develop rhythm, grace, and 
harmony in the carriage and movements of the body.

      (2) Many children cannot be interested in any type 
of bodily exercise except through their esthetic natures. 
(3) Such exercises, when well worked out, make very 
acceptable material for pageants, play-days, or local 
school exercises. 
The teacher will need a thirty-five-dollar victrola with 
appropriate records to do this work with the greatest 
success. The Victor record numbers have been given 
in each case, if there is a record made for that produc-

farmer chooses a wife from the circle; before the end of 
third stanza the wife chooses a child; fourth stanza the 
child takes a dog. 
5. They all go round, they all go round, 
Heigh-o, the dairy-o, they all go round.

farmer. 
The Muffin Man. V.R. 17568 
“The Muffin Man” is a singing game of choosing and 
counting, in which a player skips in time to the music 
to another child, who is seated and sings a verse which 
is answered by the other, The two then join hands 
and dance around the circle, singing: “Two of us know,” 
ete: 
Looby Loo. V.R. 17567 
All join hands, forming a circle, ““Here we go Looby 
Loo,” etc., dance around from right to left, hop and 
turn on “light.” “Here we go Looby Loo, all on a 
Saturday night”; dance around from left to right. “I 
put my right hand in,” etc.; players stand still, and put 
the right hand in toward the center of the circle, and then 
point it toward the outside of the circle; facing center, 
shake hand in time with music. Turn rapidly about in 
place as last line is sung, shouting “Oh!” on last note 
of measure. 
Then repeat motions of first stanza. The game is 
continued, and players go through movements indi- 
cated by words. On last stanza, a little jump toward 
center of circle is taken.

the opposite side. They join both hands and swing 
about to the left—two slide steps to a measure. 
3d and 4th: 
‘You see me, and I see you, 
Then you take me, and I take you. 
On first note, all clap hands, then join hands with 
first partners and swing vigorously to places with slid- 
ing step; at the end all are in original rows, but the 
partners have changed places, so those that were in 
front row are in back row, each behind the original 
partner. 
The entire game is repeated, those now in back row 
playing ‘‘Peek-a-boo.”

Soldier Boy 
Children form circle and sing. One child marches 
around inside circle carrying a flag or stick. At the 
end of the singing the leader may salute some one, who 
becomes flag-bearer and marches. This is repeated 
until all the circle are chosen. Various imitative mo- 
tions may be used, as folding the arms in imitation of 
a knapsack, blowing imaginary trumpets, playing an 
imaginary drum, etc. The drum effects accent the 
rhythm while paper soldiers’ hats will add to the in- 
terest.

spin around in place from left to right again, facing cen- 
ter. This is done at last line of all stanzas. 
(Second stanza to eighth stanza.) 
At each stanza perform the action indicated by the 
text, all children doing the same thing. 
The first stanza with its movements may be repeated 
between the second and third, third and fourth, and all 
succeeding stanzas, or it may be played but once, at the 
beginning. 
Did You Ever See a Lassie? V.R. 17568

At the second line, “Did you ever,” etc., the child 
performs an original movement to the rhythm of the 
music, changing her movement when she desires. Chil- 
dren imitate. 
If a boy is the leader the word “‘laddie” is substituted 
for “lassie.”

CHAPTER XIII 
THE SUPERVISED LUNCH 
The following excerpt from a Kansas State Agricul- 
tural College bulletin, volume No. 7, sets forth in a very 
excellent manner what should be considered in a dis- 
cussion on lunches for rural schools. 
Necessity for Proper Foods.—“Lack of proper food 
or improper feeding may be regarded as conttibuting 
quite as much to the backwardness of pupils as poor 
mentality. In fact, some authorities go so far as to 
say that overfeeding or underfeeding, in many instances, 
is responsible for poor mentality, If the children of 
the poor are half starved, many children of well-to-do 
families are overfed, and often poorly fed. They are 
allowed to eat all they can hold of what they like, whether 
it be food suited to their use or not. Children are poorly 
fed when they are given foods not properly selected and 
prepared, or not easily digested, even though they may be 
the most expensive articles on the market. Even when 
the food is properly selected and prepared, it is often 
served without regularity. Doctor James F. Russell, 
of Teachers College, Columbia University, is quoted 
as saying: ‘No greater shock ever came to me than 
when I once called a physician to diagnose the illness of 
one of my children, and was told very bluntly that what 
ailed the child was food.’” 
Instinct no Guide in Feeding Children.—Ignorance of 
the human body and its needs is at the bottom of the 
trouble. This is a field in which the instinct which 
271
-P-A-G-E-290
  272 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
guides a mother in other numerous ways seems to be 
entirely lacking. Doctor Emmett Holt, the famous 
children’s doctor, says: ‘‘One of the most striking things 
about children suffering from malnutrition is their vul- 
nerability. They ‘take everything,’ as there is but 
little resistance to any infectious disease which the child 
may contract.’’ Emeline S. Whitcomb says: ‘‘To pre- 
vent the evil effect of bad nutrition, Europe began years 
ago to feed its school children by furnishing either a 
breakfast or a warm meal at noon, or in the middle of 
the afternoon. Undoubtedly, in this way, thousands 
of children have been saved from a joyless youth, and 
have made healthy members of society. This good 
work is being carried on in over 200 English cities, 150 
German cities, 1,200 French communities, 55 Italian 
cities, and in many American cities.” 
Food for Children.—What growing children need is 
plenty of simple, wholesome, easily digested food, care- 
fully prepared and regularly served. There should be 
a pleasing variation about it, and occasionally a treat 
may be permitted. Farmers are keenly alive to the 
value of a well-balanced ration for the beef cattle, for the 
dairy cows, and for the fattening hogs; what an im- 
mensely greater value will be perceived when mothers 
understand the importance of a well-balanced diet for 
their children. 
Attractiveness of School Lunch.—In many States the 
matter of malnutrition of children is a grave menace; 
in some States there are countless hundreds of boys and 
girls who do not receive a balanced ration. Hot lunches 
in the rural schools are not so much for the balancing of 
rations as for adding palatability to the every day cold 
and often unattractive lunch. This lunch hour may be 
 
-P-A-G-E-291
  
THE. SUPERVISED LUNCH 273 
a time of healthy sociability among the schocl children 
during the lunch time. It is hoped that it will also aid 
in teaching good table manners in an indirect way. 
THe Cotp LuNcH 
The school lunch is much discussed at women’s meet- 
ings, and there is a decided effort toward improvement. 
A cold lunch need not lack attractiveness any more 
than it needs to be without food value; although the 
latter should have the first consideration, the former 
should in nowise be overlooked. Plain, even poor, fare 
will be relished if served in an appetizing manner. Miss 
Emeline S. Whitcomb says: ‘‘The contents of the lunch 
should consist of ‘something starchy and something fat 
and something fibery, something sweet and something 
savory.’ Bread and butter or sandwiches of some 
sort will always be the basis of a lunch. The bread 
should be cut in moderately thin, even slices, having 
the butter spread evenly on the bread. There can be 
an endless variation in the filling for sandwiches— 
chopped meat seasoned and moistened, chopped nuts, 
eggs or fruits, such as raisins, dates or figs. (Where 
canned or preserved fruit or jelly is to be used as a 
part of the lunch, it is better to put it into a covered 
glass or jar.) The sandwiches keep moist longer if 
wrapped in oiled or paraffin paper; this also prevents 
the lunch from mashing together. Fresh fruit in season 
may be added to the lunch or a dessert in the form of a 
little treat. If this treat be a surprise, it will add to the 
pleasure of the lunch. The dessert should be little in 
quantity—a bit of cake, a couple of cookies, a cup of 
custard, a handful of nuts, or a piece or two of candy. 
A lunch carefully prepared may be as tempting as one 
 
-P-A-G-E-292
  274 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
could wish and also meet the needs of the body. If 
something hot be eaten with the lunch, loss of appetite, 
so prevalent among children, due to the monotony of 
cold lunches every day, is prevented.” 
There are two distinct types of supervised noon 
lunches: the supervised lunch without the warm dish 
and the lunch with the hot supplement. Both need 
very careful management. 
AIMS OF THE SUPERVISED LUNCH 
Physical.—Every child is required to sit quietly in 
his seat for twenty to twenty-five minutes to eat his 
noon meal. This encourages proper mastication of a 
sufficient amount of food. The children cannot grab 
an apple in one hand and a piece of bread and butter 
in the other, run to the playground, and at an exciting 
time of the game throw away most of what they may 
have in their hands. If children know that they are to 
eat their noon meal in an orderly fashion they will not 
go to the dinner-pail at recess time in the morning and 
remove the best food. Should any do so, the teacher 
could explain why such habits are harmful. A large 
percent of country children suffer from malnutrition; 
a large percent are under weight. Few children eat 
enough vegetables and drink enough milk to supply the 
needed minerals and vitamines. Lack of variety is 
another evil. Malnutrition is the result. This means 
less vitality. Many country children eat an early 
breakfast, a few eat practically nothing. A warm dish 
will aid digestion and make the cold lunch more valua- 
ble. A school that aims to build up a constructive 
health program should feature the school lunch. There 
is a vital connection between man’s psychic and physi-
-P-A-G-E-293

ological natures. The efficiency of one depends upon 
the strength of the other. The bad effect of malnutri- 
tion upon the mind is an established fact. Correct 
food habits mean proper nourishment and improved 
mentality. 
Educational.—When the noonday lunch becomes a 
part of the daily school routine the teacher has an ex- 
cellent opportunity to teach practical lessons in domes- 
tic science. For example, the use of milk as a food, 
especially for growing children, the use or abuse of 
sweets and condiments, the selection of certain foods 
for the lunch-basket. These hints for food selection 
not only will have their effect upon the children but 
also will gradually find their way to the mothers. 
The school lunch that does not function in moral de- 
velopment is a partial failure. Education is measured 
in terms of conduct. The lunch can be a factor in 
teaching responsibility, unselfishness, reverence, self- 
respect in habits of cleanliness and refinement. 
Social.—Proper social development is an outstanding 
problem in enriching rural life. The school lunch hour, 
properly organized and supervised, becomes a period 
for happy sociability, comradeship, and fellowship, in 
place of the unsightly “eat as you run” spectacle. The 
teacher who eats with the children can direct this most 
important part of the lunch period. She has a wonder- 
ful opportunity to suggest sociability that increases co- 
operation and friendliness. 
The Routine of the Supervised Luncheon.—At 11.45 
the children are dismissed by groups to prepare for 
lunch. The monitors get the dinner-pails from the 
shelf and pass them to the pupils and the teacher. A 
napkin or desk-cloth is spread on the desk, and upon
-P-A-G-E-294
       276 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
this the food is nicely arranged according to a plan 
worked out by pupils and teacher. The teacher acts as 
hostess, and is an example to the children. After 
twenty or twenty-five minutes all will have finished, 
and in an orderly fashion placed dishes, remaining food, 
napkins, and desk-cloths in the dinner-pails. The mon- 
itors collect the pails and return them to the shelf. 
Now all may enjoy a good half hour of fun on the play- 
ground. This type of lunch needs no equipment, ex- 
cept something to cover the tops of the desks, and clean 
newspapers can be used for this. ‘There is really no 
good reason why this type of lunch cannot be used. The 
enterprising teacher, by using this supervised lunch as a 
beginning, can many times introduce the hot supple- 
- ment later. 
  THE SUPERVISED Hor SupPLEMENT 
Preparation.—Ordinarily, and especially in the rural 
school, the teacher does not have time to cook the food, 
so the work must be done by the pupils themselves. 
Two pupils are usually enough to prepare the dish, and 
one of these should be an older pupil. Two others 
should wash the dishes. If there is a large number to 
be served, two should be waitresses, otherwise the ones 
who cook will do the serving. The boys will be glad to 
help and will do as well as the girls. 
Equipment and Supplies —Where there is equipment 
for teaching domestic science add a granite pail or two, 
and large ladles to be used in serving. The cooking is 
done on a blue-flame kerosene stove (never gasoline). 
Each child provides his own serving-dishes and silver- 
ware. These are kept in the school until the close of 
the term. In the fall, enough corn husks are gathered

  to make mats or pads, so that each pupil may have 
one to place beneath his hot dish. The desk-cloth is 
made from a flour-sack. Each child makes three. 
They are neatly hemmed, and often the children work 
their initials in one corner. A clean napkin is placed in 
his lunch-box each day. 
In the fall, when fruits and vegetables are plentiful, 
each child gathers his share and brings it to school, or 
to some home where the domestic science class meet and 
can them for winter use. These canned goods are then 
carefully stored away in a neighbor’s cellar and called 
for as needed. Carrots, corn, tomatoes, and apples are 
the most common foods canned. Other garden truck, 
as beans, onions, potatoes, turnips, and cabbage, is 
stored away in a vegetable cellar and supplied as needed. 
In this case, each child signs up for what he has ready 
to bring. For other supplies, such as milk, butter, eggs, 
and flour, a calendar is made. The names of the pupils 
are listed alphabetically, and they are called upon to 
supply in their turn. Care is taken to apportion the 
supply so that all may share alike. 
Teaching Eating Habits —Many children in the rural 
schools by the careless way in which they eat their noon- 
day lunch form habits of eating which are wasteful, in- 
jurious to health, and destructive to refined table man- 
ners. While the mother is training her lad and lassie 
“not to take more on their plates than they can eat,” 
or is insisting that they “clean up their plates” before 
they take any more food, the same children at school 
are permitted to take sandwiches, cake, or other food 
from well-filled lunch-baskets, and run out to play, only 
to throw away large portions of the food as the game 
becomes exciting.
-P-A-G-E-297
  THE SUPERVISED LUNCH 279 
Eating piecemeal through the noon hour, eating while 
the body is in a high state of nervous tension, gulping 
food, and rowdy conduct quite often characterize the 
noonday meal in the country school where there is no 
supervision on the part of the teacher. 
In the rural demonstration schools associated with 
the Iowa State Teachers’ College an attempt is being 
made to supplement the child’s home training with 
school training, and to prevent the formation of bad 
habits of eating and improper manners. Sandwiches, 
cake, and scraps.of food are not thrown about the school 
grounds. When noon time approaches each school be- 
gins to prepare for serving the noonday lunch, if by 
nothing more than by taking the pails and baskets to 
the desks where the children sit to eat in an orderly way, 
just as if they were at their own tables at home. 
Dishes Commonly Served.—The dishes most commonly 
prepared are (1) soups: corn, potato, tomato, and bean; 
(2) scalloped dishes: corn and potato; (3) baked dishes: 
beans and Spanish rice; (4) creamed carrots, potato, 
eggs; (5) puddings: chocolate, vanila custard, rice, and 
bread; (6) hot chocolate is served as a beverage. 
School Lunch Routine-—In a number of the demon- 
stration schools the domestic science girls cook a hot 
dish to serve with the lunches the children bring from 
home. The program is so planned that a general period 
for educative seat work begins about 11.30 A.M. The 
teacher instructs the older girls as to the preparation 
of the warm dish. (Much of this detailed work has 
usually been done at recess time by pupils and teacher.) 
These girls proceed with the lunch. The older boys 
may work at manual training, or any other line of manual 
work that they may have to do, and the rest of the school  
-P-A-G-E-298
  280 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
are employed at hand work. By this plan every one 
is engaged in manual exercises just before the noon hour. 
At twelve o’clock the children are dismissed to pre- 
pare for lunch. They return to their seats and the 
monitors appointed pass the dinner-pails. At a signal 
all lunches are arranged on the desks. A napkin or 
desk-cloth is first spread upon the desk, upon this the 
food is arranged. If a spoon is to be used, it is placed 
in the proper position with the same care as it would be 
if the children were setting the table for a fine banquet. 
No child begins to eat until the signal has been given 
that all are ready. The waiters from the domestic sci- 
ence class pass the hot dish. The teacher eats her 
lunch with the children. There is quiet but pleasant 
conversation. Lessons in good manners are caught as 
well as taught. At the close of the meal all the left-overs 
and the dishes brought from the home are packed into 
the baskets. Then all are excused and the monitors 
of the day carry the baskets and pails to the hall. The 
waiters gather up the remaining dishes, wash them, and 
finish the work in the kitchen. It usually takes until 
12.30 to complete the noon lunch. The girls in the 
domestic science class take turns serving and washing 
dishes. 
Model Plan 
8.45- 9.00. Carroll and Ann wash and peel %4-peck potatoes 
and put in cold water. 
10.30. Carroll puts water in kettle to heat over a low 
flame. Wash off milk bottle and open. Pour 
milk into double boiler. Ann measures 14-cup 
butter and 5 teaspoonfuls salt. 
II.00. Ann puts potatoes into boiling water (add salt 
after potatoes are boiling). Put some hot water 
into lower part of double boiler. 
 
-P-A-G-E-299
  THE SUPERVISED LUNCH 281 
I1.45. Carroll puts milk on to heat. Sets out bowls, 
spoons, and napkins. Assists in heating pota- 
toes. Ann removes potatoes from fire, drains 
and mashes, putting in %4-cup butter, and hot 
milk. 
12.00-12.15. Two other children serve if cafeteria service is not 
possible. 
12.30-12.45. |Three children clear away dishes; one washing, 
one drying, and one putting away. 
By-Products of Noon Lunch.—As may be expected, 
difficulties arise from time to time. Sometimes the po- 
tatoes, for instance, do not get done on, time. This 
situation is handled just as it would be in a well-ordered 
household. Every one keeps busy at play, or at work, 
until the meal is ready to be served, and then’ it is 
eaten in as orderly a procedure as if it had been ready 
on time. There is no going to dinner pails and eat- 
ing part of the lunch before time to serve it any more 
than a family would eat part of the meal before the re- 
mainder was prepared. The children no more think of 
being disorderly during the lunch period than they do 
during their arithmetic or reading lessons. Thus 
through the supervised lunch, practical training in cook- 
ery and serving is given to the girls in the domestic sci- 
ence class, refinement in table manners is fostered in 
all members of the school. Proper food, properly eaten, 
plus the half hour of play, make clear-skinned, healthy 
groups of girls and boys, the desired result of the super- 
vised noon hour.

How would you proceed to establish the hot supplement 
and the supervised lunch if they had never been tried in 
your school ? 
. Suppose some families objected to furnishing supplies for 
the warm dish. How would you manage such a situa- 
tion? 
. Suppose your schoolroom is too small to give any space for 
additional equipment for the noon lunch. How would 
you proceed ? 
. Should boys take any part in preparing and serving of the 
noon lunch? 
. Suppose one of the parents objects to his child being ‘‘ham- 
pered” by this “new notion” of the noon lunch? What 
will you do about it? 
. Suppose that one or two families persisted in furnishing poor 
food in their children’s lunch baskets. What would 
you do about it? 
. Under what circumstances would you suggest that the dis- 
trict have dishes enough at the schoolhouse to serve the 
noon lunch? 
Suppose that some of the best patrons want the district to 
furnish all the supplies for the noon lunches. What is 
your opinion on this? 
PROBLEMS 
. Miss Y teaches at Center School. The first day she dis- 
covers that the children place their dinner-pails on the 
floor in the outside hall near the rubbers. She notices 
that some of the lunches are wrapped in newspapers, 
some are in old baskets and dingy pails. She notices 
that the lunches themselves are not wholesome. The 
children smile when the teacher mentions bringing milk 
to school. How would you solve these problems? 
- In School No. 7 the enrollment consists of eight children in 
the first grade, four older boys in sixth, seventh, and 
eighth grades, and one girl in the eighth grade. Would 
you attempt the hot supplement? How would you 
proceed ?

CHAPTER XIV 
HEALTH EDUCATION 
Need for Health Training.—Of the so-called new 
movements in education there is no one of greater sig- 
nificance and promise than that of health education. 
Scientific investigations and the intense struggles of a 
World War, demanding unusual physical strength at 
home as well as abroad, gave this movement a mighty 
impetus. There never was a time when physical strength 
translated into intellectual and moral power meant as 
much for individual and national success as to-day. 
We are more or less familiar with the facts brought 
out in the examinations of millions of draft men. We 
wish to call special attention to two facts. First, about 
one half of the men found incapacitated for military 
service because of health conditions came from rural 
communities. Second, thousands of young men were 
rejected because of physical defects that in youth could 
have been removed. 
But we have even more conclusive proof than war 
figures of the need for health care, both in city and coun- 
try. Physical examination of boys and girls in school 
now gives us some startling facts. In one county 87 
per cent of the rural children suffered from one or more 
physical ailments. Hundreds of thousands of health 
examinations have been made, and all tell the same 
story of need and that rural children are not excepted. 
In spite of this fact there are a number of people living 
in a fool’s paradise thinking that God’s open air, and 
284 
 
-P-A-G-E-303
  HEALTH EDUCATION 285 
inspiring sentiments about the beauty of nature found 
in sermon and in song, are a guarantee for health. 
Our increasing knowledge only emphasizes the need 
for health work. Through united and intelligent effort 
we must make the weak strong, the crooked straight, 
and the timid courageous. 
Health a Management Problem.—Altendance and 
Healith—Perfect attendance has been urged elsewhere 
in the text. Economic loss follows poor attendance. 
One of the Middle Western States loses $45,000,000 a 
year on its school investment. Eighty per cent of this 
loss is due to preventable illness. One of every five 
children is absent daily because of illness. A nurse in a 
Western county, summarizing her first year’s work, dis- 
closed the following figures: 3,340 pupils inspected; 
1,855 had physical defects; 906 bad teeth; 610 nasal ob- 
structions; 597 defective throats; 254 poor eyes; 857 
under weight. With the above conditions true in many 
localities it becomes evident that health is a school 
problem. If the American schools are to function as 
educational centers with the growing citizens of the na- 
tion, they must help make it possible for healthy chil- 
dren to attend school. The teacher needs to make 
plans for health work in her school just as much as 
she would for the teaching of reading or arithmetic. 
Proper Physical Environment.—It is folly to talk 
about health education if the school plant and the equip- 
ment destroy as fast as we can build up. One of the 
outstanding achievements of the last two decades has 
been the progress made in schoolhouse construction and 
sanitary equipment. Our country children should profit 
by this progress. First of all, the pupils must be prop- 
erly housed. The modern building described in a pre-
-P-A-G-E-304
286 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
vious chapter should be the goal. The building must 
be properly ventilated, the heat regulated, and the air 
properly humidified. The light must be right both as 
to kind and amount. One of the most serjous problems 
in the rural school is that of seating. Improper seating 
is one of the outstanding causes for poor health and 
physical deformities. 
Recreation and Physical: Training —This subject is 
fully treated in another chapter. It is restated here to 
emphasize its importance in health education. Special 
emphasis should be placed upon games that tend to 
correct physical defects and keep the body in good con- 
dition. 
One of our most hopeful experiments along this line 
is the so-called work-study-play program. Is physical 
education possible in a rural school? Yes, because its 
chief emphasis is placed upon the playing of games. 
The present tendency toward outdoor play as a part of 
regular school work is exceedingly wholesome, and 
should result in better health conditions in rural com- 
munities. 
It is evident that health ideals find a place in many of 
the management problems of the school. 
What the Teacher Can Do.—Teach Health Habits.— 
A person is never safe until the common health duties 
become habitual. The essential health habits are sim- 
ple, but important. In the development of health 
habits the first step is to make the child desire health. 
Master the law of habit formation. Perhaps the Modern 
Health Crusade, or a similar method, is the teacher’s 
best aid in teaching the rules of the health game. De- 
cide upon some method and master the details. In any 
attempt to inculcate health habits, some form of morn- 
 
-P-A-G-E-305
   
          HEALTH EDUCATION 
  287 
ing inspection is essential. The plan of the Health 
Crusade is described as follows: 
  The Modern Health Crusade is a system of health education 
originated by the National Tuberculosis Association. There is 
probably not a State in which it is not now well established, 
many of them having State directors. The Crusade teaches the 
fundamental health rules chiefly through the use of a health 
chore record, which is checked daily by the child. This record 
extends over a period of from fifteen to thirty weeks. The child 
who does 75 per cent of the Crusaders’ health chores for two, 
five, ten, or fifteen weeks becomes successively a page, squire, 
knight, and knight baronet in health chivalry. On the wall of 
the schoolroom is a roll of knighthood, on which the Crusaders’ 
names are inscribed. Seventeen State Departments of Educa- 
tion have adopted the Crusade as a part of the curriculum, in 
many of which school credit is given to children earning honors.

288 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
Co-operate With the School Nurse.—Any effective sys- 
tem of physical education and health development must 
be based on thorough medical inspection. A cumulative 
record for every individual is essential. This knowledge 
is valuable, however, only as an honest attempt is 
made to remove the defects. The person best adapted 
and most successful for this work, especially the fol- 
low-up work, is the school nurse. No other person can 
so effectively awaken a community to its health needs. 
The teacher has a twofold responsibility in this con- 
nection. She should first exert her influence to get the 
people to work for a county nurse, and then to keep her. 
In the next place the teacher must assist the nurse in 
her work and make her work effective in the district. 
This means developing the right sentiments toward the 
county nurse on the part of parents and pupils, help 
her in her follow-up work, arrange for public meetings, 
and get parents to bring their children to clinics. Where 
there is no county nurse, the teacher must assume a 
greater responsibility. This is especially true in regard 
to physical diagnosis work. The teacher should make a 
study of and be able to detect the symptoms of the 
more common diseases and ailments. She should be 
able to give the simple eye test. She should also have 
mastered the details of first aid work. The teacher 
must exercise special care in case of contagious diseases; 
know the laws of the State, the rules and regulations 
of the State and local boards on this point. 
Know Communicable Diseases.—No child should ever 
knowingly be exposed to a communicable disease. The 
older a child is before being exposed by accident to a 
communicable disease the less likely he is to take it. 
Teachers should know the symptoms of the common 
  
-P-A-G-E-307
    HEALTH EDUCATION 289 
diseases among children. Many of these diseases if not 
cared for properly result in serious defects. Measles 
are too often treated as a very small matter. Many 
eyes have been ruined for ever because of the lack of 
knowledge of the effect of measles on that delicate 
organ. The same might be said of many of the “harm- 
ful” diseases. 
The tables on pages 290 to 293 are included with 
the hope that students may become more familiar with 
the communicable diseases of children and that as teach- 
ers they may apply their knowledge. 
Know THE OUTSTANDING EVIDENCE OF 
Adenoids and Enlarged Tonsils.—The physical condi- 
tion of school children is the index to community health. 
Physicians cannot accomplish the task of pointing out 
these difficulties, because they are not given the oppor- 
tunity. It becomes the duty of the teacher to know 
some of the simple and very plain evidences of the more 
common ailments that hinder children’s progress in 
school. If the teacher will work at this task in a tact- 
ful manner she will save many discouragements among 
parents and children and make her own work more 
effective. This first discussion is the most important 
because adenoids and enlarged tonsils cause most of the 
other difficulties discussed. The authors suggest that 
the student make a careful study of ‘‘adenoids and 
tonsils.” If such a study is made then there will be no 
difficulty in seeing that all the evidences mentioned be- 
low have their sources in adenoids and enlarged tonsils. 
Evidences that may be read by any teacher or parent: 
(a) Mouth breathing. 
(6) Foul breath.

IMPETIGO-FAVUS—“SORES” 
Impetigo are sores which soon form loose scales. Very contagious. Child should use 
separate towels. Exclude from school until his condition is such that the disease can- 
not be transmitted to others. 
RINGWORM 
Begins as a small, reddish, scaly patch. It gradually increases in size. Meanwhile 
the central, or oldest, part recovers and characteristic ring-like appearance results. 
Located on the face, wrists, neck, and hands. Treatment should be under the care 
of a physician. Exclude from school until condition is such that the disease cannot be transmitted to 
others. 
PEDICULOSIS, OR HEAD LICE 
School children with head lice should be excluded from school until no live lice can be found on very close inspection. School children with nits may attend school, pro- vided they are under vigorous treatment for their removal. Consult a physician’ as to proper treatment. 
SCABIES, OR ITCH 
An infectious eruption found most frequently on the palms of the hand and between 
the fingers. Quite contagious, especially to others in the family. Exclude from school until the condition is such that the disease cannot be transmitted to others. Treatment 
should be under the care of a physician. 
  
(c) Hacking throat cough. 
(d) Frequent nosebleeds. 
(e) Dark rings under the eyes. 
(f) Narrow upper jaw and protruding teeth. 
(g) Stuffy speech—‘‘dose” for “nose.” 
(h) Poor eyesight 
(i) Poor hearing. 
(j) Nervousness. 
(k) Snores and terrific throat noises in sleep. 
(1) Tumbling and tossing in sleep. 
If a considerable number of these evidences appear a 
good physician should see each case. Parents should 
be talked to tactfully. Teachers should learn all they 
can about this question and then help the parents to 
understand the dangers of inaction. 
Malnutrition —Malnutrition is a serious health defect 
in children. Most all of the children who are 10 per
-P-A-G-E-313
  HEALTH EDUCATION 295 
cent or more underweight for height and age are handi- 
capped from malnutrition. Twenty per cent of all 
school children are malnourished. Rural health sur- 
veys have proven beyond a doubt that rural children 
suffer more than city children because of being under- 
nourished. Again this is a management question, and 
the teacher must ever be on the alert to help drive away 
this spectre by holding up ideals in the supervised lunch 
hour and in her discussions with parents. Malnutrition 
is not limited to the slums or poorer homes. Many 
times the best homes experience such difficulties, not 
because of poor foods but improper mastication and 
hurried eating. 
Evidences that may be read by teacher and parent: 
(a) Lack of ambition and vitality. 
() Flabby muscles. 
(c) Anemia. 
(d) Underweight. 
(e) Lessened resistance against many kinds of diseases. 
(f) Easily fatigued. 
As suggested above, this is a problem that must be 
worked out through the noon lunch. Such ideals as: 
(a) Proper food chewed thoroughly, eaten regularly, and 
never hurriedly. (0) Some fruit or well-cooked vege- 
tables every day. (c) Plenty of sleep and rest. A care- 
ful observance of the health chores in Crusade Chores 
would help solve this difficulty. It would be well if 
teachers could plan to weigh their children once a month 
and keep records, thus interesting the children in the 
problem. A rural teacher could borrow a farmer’s scales 
if it were not possible to have a set for the school. 
The following plans for keeping height and weight 
records, and the tables for height and weight of boys and

girls, have been found very helpful. These are published 
with the permission of Doctor Thomas D. Wood of 
New York City, chairman of the Committee on Health 
Problems in Education.

Poor Eyesight.—Poor eyesight is a very serious handi- 
cap to many children. The difficulty is that the same 
children who suffer from eye-strain and poor vision are 
the ones usually who suffer from adenoids and mal- 
nutrition. Teachers should watch for difficulties here, 
and if such individuals are found their parents should 
be urged to consult a physician. 
Evidences that may be read by ceachers and parents: 
(a) Headache, commonly through forehead or back 
of head, or both. 
(b) Inability to see blackboard. 
(c) Nervous exhaustion.

laid in childhood. What is said about poor eyesight 
could be said here about poor hearing. 
Evidences that may be read by teachers and parents: 
(a) Child inattentive and listless. 
(6) Child needs to have assignments or directions re- 
eated very often. 
(c) Mentally backward. 
(d) Retarded in school work. 
(e) Frequent earache. 
Teachers can discover poor hearing by a very simple 
ame. Blindfold the pupil and let him locate a clock

left ear. Several “games” of this nature will locate 
those who cannot hear well. 
Up to this time not much has been said as to what 
should be done about these four difficulties. Teachers 
can do nothing more than point out the conditions of 
children to their parents, and then use every influence 
that is just to get parents to give their children medical 
attention. If there is a county nurse with whom the 
teacher may work the results may be reached much 
sooner. 
The teacher can further the cause of health by dis- 
cussing quarantine laws with the children. A good 
lesson in citizenship can be worked out in connection 
with this topic.    
   
   
   
   
    
    
   
      
     
    
   Wuat THE ScHooLt Can Do 
Co-operate in County Play Days and Health Pageants. 
—These are two very important factors in health work, 
and the teacher should welcome an opportunity to par- 
ticipate in them. The county superintendent of schools 
will often organize play days on a county-wide scale. 
Give your superintendent enthusiastic support in thi 
matter. Health projects may vary from a simple pla 
by the primary pupils to a community health day 
Pageants worked up in school may be used in a com 
munity program. 
Co-operate With Health Authorities —School board 
and teachers can do very effective work in helping healt 
officers and medical inspectors. 
Epidemics occur every day with about the same re} 
ularity as Christmas and New Year’s. Where thes 
contagions occur fumigation is necessary. School boar 
and teachers should make it as easy as possible for th

  HEALTH EDUCATION 301 
administering of such precautions. As has been sug- 
gested in the communicable disease chart, school au- 
thorities should co-operate with health officers in keeping 
children out of school who have contagious diseases. 
It would be well for school boards and county super- 
intendents to place the following health rules in every 
schoolroom. This is taken from Doctor Wood’s health 
education report. 
Tren GOLDEN RULES FOR SCHOOL CHILDREN 
I. Play hard and fair—be loyal to your team mates 
and generous to your opponents. 
II. Eat slowly. Do not eat between meals. Chew 
food thoroughly. Never drink water when there is food 
in the mouth. Drink water several times during the 
day. 
III. Brush your teeth at least once a day. Rinse 
your mouth out well with water after each meal. 
IV. Be sure your bowels move at least once each 
day. 
V. Keep clean—body, clothes, and mind. Wash 
your hands always before eating. Take a warm bath 
with soap once or twice a week; a cool sponge (or shower) 
bath each morning before breakfast, and rub your body 
to a glow with a rough towel. 
VI. Try to keep your companions, especially young 
children, away from those who have contagious diseases. 
VII. Use your handkerchief to cover a sneeze or 
cough, and try to avoid coughing, sneezing, or blowing 
your nose in front of others. 
VIII. Study hard—and in stuay, work, or play do 
your best.

  CHAPTER XV 
CITIZENSHIP 
The urgent need for teaching citizenship to our boys 
and girls at the earliest practicable moment in their 
schooling is now generally recognized. Through the 
World War the problem has been brought into general 
consideration. If civic training is to be effective, it 
should begin with the child’s entrance in school and 
should be continuous and persistent. 
True American ideals must be created in the minds of 
the American youth while they are in the public schools. 
The Teacher’s Responsibility.—There is a growing 
opinion not only that citizenship should be taught in 
all of the elementary grades but also that it should be 
taught in a new way. The old traditional study of the 
machinery of government with much emphasis on con- 
stitutions is both tedious and ineffectual. Instead, the 
child should be recognized as a young citizen. He is a 
member of the community and its most important in- 
stitutions, viz., the home, the school, and the church. 
He will always be a member of some social community. 
The teacher, then, should understand that the school is 
the most efficient means in training pupils for this so- 
cial citizenship. It is in school, very largely, that the 
pupil must acquire those social habits which make him 
a good citizen. In fact, no school is a good school in 
which habits of politeness, courtesy, honesty, and fair- 
ness are not taught. The teaching of these habits is 
304 
 
-P-A-G-E-323
    CITIZENSHIP 305 
largely a management problem. They cannot be 
taught in set lessons, but must be acquired through 
daily and hourly practice in all of the school’s activities. 
If the school is properly organized and conducted it 
becomes a powerful factor in the forming of right habits 
by the pupils. f 
CirizeNsHip THRouGH Goop MANAGEMENT 
No attempt is here made to offer a course of study for 
the teaching of citizenship. Neither is it the purpose 
to give suggestions on the formal teaching of the sub- 
ject. The topics which follow are discussed, first, be- 
cause they are very closely and definitely related to 
the management of the school, and second, because 
they are each and,all important factors in the making 
of good citizens. 
Obedience.—The child has been taught obedience at 
home. In school, however, he meets with it in a new 
way. His failure to obey there concerns not only him- 
self and the teacher but the entire school. Obedience 
at school should be the beginning of the adult’s respect 
for law and order. The school, then, is the connecting 
link between the home and the community. The pupil 
should be led to obey promptly, completely, and cheer- 
fully. While a child at first will obey because he is 
told to do so, it should be the teacher’s aim to inspire 
him to obey, first, to please her, and later, because a 
voice from within tells him that he should do it. 
Cleanliness—This topic is mentioned not from the 
standpoint of personal hygiene, but because of its im- 
portance as a social factor. A visit to several schools 
will impress the visitor with the teacher’s influence in 
this matter. The children in one school will be taught
-P-A-G-E-324
  
306 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
to wash their hands and faces and to brush their hair 
after the noonday play. The very atmosphere there 
breathes self-respect and happiness. In another school, 
no attention is given by the teacher to the pupils’ per- 
sonal cleanliness, and there is an evident lack of that 
self-respect and happiness. Of course it should not be 
necessary to say that the teacher’s own personal ap- 
pearance is, perhaps, the greatest influence in the de- 
velopment of the pupils’ habits of cleanliness. 
Orderliness.—This topic is closely related to cleanli- 
ness. Again the teacher may set the standards. Her 
desk should be a model for the pupil’s desk. There 
should be ‘“‘a place for everything, and everything in 
its place.” The writer has in mind a teacher who com- 
pletely changed the entire atmosphere of a school by 
“tidying up” the interior of an old school building. 
Every pupil in that school seemed anxious to keep his 
desk orderly so that it would fit into the general scheme 
of the room. Such habits thoroughly instilled during 
school life are sure to function for good citizenship in 
adult life. A boy thus trained, when he becomes a 
farmer, will not permit obnoxious weeds along his road- 
side to become a nuisance to his neighbors. 
Punctuality—The success of school depends in a large 
measure upon the manner in which all of the pupils are 
“pulling together” with the teacher. Each pupil should 
feel that he is a cog in the wheel. If he fails, the ma- 
chine fails also. To come late to his task interferes with 
the work of all the others. And so it is in life. Imagine 
an. important public meeting. The time set for open- 
ing the meeting has arrived, and the citizens are all 
there except the chairman. He comes thirty minutes 
late. Can he be considered a “good”’ citizen?   
-P-A-G-E-325
    CITIZENSHIP 307 
Helping One Another.—We have been told by people 
of other lands that the American spirit is one of selfish- 
ness; that we are a nation of “money grabbers.” Of 
course, we do not believe that such is true. We claim 
that our nation can point with pride to more great 
deeds of unselfishness than any other nation in the his- 
tory of the world. But if we wish to maintain this al- 
truistic spirit and to improve upon it, we must begin 
by instilling in the hearts of the boys and girls in.school 
the desire to be helpful to others. The teacher should 
encourage the pupils to be helpful to her in little tasks 
which they can perform, and to be helpful to each other. 
They should be taught to be “good neighbors.” 
Good Manners.—‘Manners are of more importance 
than laws. Upon them, in a great measure, the laws 
depend. According to their quality they aid morals; 
they supply them or they totally destroy them.” The 
teacher cannot too strongly feel her responsibility in 
training her pupils in good manners. In fact, she must 
assume a large responsibility here. In the home the 
child’s experiences are largely within the family circle. 
At school he makes his first real public appearance. 
Here he meets other boys and girls of perhaps widely 
different home training and past experience. He must 
be taught to treat them all with courtesy and sym- 
pathy. Again, the teacher’s example will count for 
more than her teaching. She must emphasize that good 
manners come through a proper attitude, and therefore 
must come from within. 
Truthfulness—The teacher has many opportunities 
for teaching the lesson of truthfulness. In chapter XIX, 
on “Discipline,” it is said that the one rule which every 
teacher should endeavor to establish for her pupils is
-P-A-G-E-326
    
308 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
the rule to “Do Right.’”’ If a pupil is to obey that rule 
he must be truthful. Children should be impressed 
with the fact that the business of the world depends 
upon truthfulness. We expect the grocer to tell the 
truth when he tells us the price of sugar. The child 
expects others to be truthful to him. He would deeply 
resent an untruth on the part of the teacher. He would 
not study his text-books if he believed that they were 
not truthful. The teacher should impress upon her 
pupils the evil effects upon a child who forms the habit 
. of lying. Will any one want such a person for a friend? 
Honesty.—To be honest means more than to be truth- 
ful. It means to do thorough work as well as to speak 
the truth. To put the interests of others on a level 
with your own. It is “that sense of right which makes 
it impossible to take or use that which does not rightly 
belong to us.” Is the child honest when he copies his 
lesson from another pupil and presents it as his own? 
What should a child do on finding a lost article? What 
should he do if he breaks a borrowed article? In each 
case he should be shown the effect of his present attitude 
* on such questions upon his success in life when he leaves 
school. ‘Honest Abe Lincoln” appeals to children. 
They should be shown that it was his honesty which 
made him one of the greatest of American citizens of all 
time. 
Courage—It takes courage to be a good citizen. 
Courage to serve your country not only in time of war 
but also in times of peace. At school the child should 
be led to develop his courage by overcoming timidity, 
by enduring pain when hurt upon the playground, and 
by acting and speaking the truth regardless of conse- 
quences. One of the greatest lessons that every child
-P-A-G-E-327
     CITIZENSHIP 309 
has to learn is to dare to stand alone if his own conscience 
tells him he is right. A teacher should never fail to 
highly commend a pupil for such courage. 
Fair Play.—Play when properly directed by the 
teacher affords the best opportunity for teaching the 
true “American spirit.” Every boy and girl should 
learn to “play fair,” to “obey the rules,” and to accept 
the “umpire’s”’ decision. No bullies or cheats should be 
permitted. The teacher of a one-room country school 
should especially insist upon fair play. She frequently 
has one or two pupils who are considerably older or 
larger than the rest of the school. They often become 
veritable dictators if the teacher is not there to insist 
on “equality for all.” 
Care of Property——Many opportunities present them- 
selves for teaching the child the right attitude toward 
property. Children often think it a sign of “smartness” 
to destroy or mar property. They should be shown 
that the needless destruction of it always means a loss 
to some one, and that the formation of such habits is 
detrimental to society in general. If the value of all 
public property needlessly destroyed in one year could 
be known it would be truly astounding. Unfortunately 
our schools must share a large part of that loss. May 
it be true that this loss is due, in a measure, to the fail- 
ure of schools in the past to properly train the young 
citizens ? 
Industry and Thrift—The boy or girl who acquires 
habits of industry and thrift possesses two very essential 
elements in the making of a good citizen. No nation 
can long endure if its citizens are shiftless and thriftless. 
The school can do much to help develop the right habits. 
Pupils should be encouraged not only to be diligent but 
 
-P-A-G-E-328
    310 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
also to persevere when the task is difficult. Examples of 
men and women who have achieved success because of 
their industry and thrift should be given to the pupils. 
Such men and women are better citizens because of their 
independence and freedom of action. We have need to 
fear the “political”’ boss only when he holds a “whip- 
hand” over those whom he controls. 
Patriotism.—Every teacher should strive to cultivate 
in the mind of each pupil a spirit of loyalty to our coun- 
try and a genuine love for it. Our experiences during 
the World War led us to recognize that in our national 
and educational life we had given too little attention to 
patriotism as one essential element in the characters of 
our growing boys and girls. Children are naturally 
patriotic. They respond readily if the appeal is made 
to them. ‘This was thoroughly demonstrated during the 
recent war. The accomplishments of the school children 
in the thrift campaigns, Junior Red Cross work, and 
other war activities will always stand as one of the bright 
spots in American history. The opening exercise period 
should be freely used for this purpose. Since it is some- 
times difficult for teachers to secure helpful material for 
opening exercises, the following helps are offered with 
the hope that they may be of service.*

HISTORY OF OUR FLAG 
On June 14, 1777, Congress passed the following reso- 
lution: 
Resolved, That the flag of the thirteen United States be thir- 
teen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen 
stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation. 
 
-P-A-G-E-330
  312 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
The adoption of this resolution was the beginning of 
the authentic history of our American flag. 
In explaining the design of our flag, Washington him- 
self said: : 
We take the star from heaven, the red from our Mother 
Country, separating it by white stripes, thus showing that we 
have separated from her, and the white stripes shall go down to 
posterity representing liberty. 
The thirteen stars in the flag adopted by Congress 
were arranged in a circle to signify union and eternal en- 
durance, the circle being the symbol of eternity. 
The first “Stars and Stripes” flag was made by Mrs. 
Elizabeth Ross, of Philadelphia. The drawing from 
which Mrs. Ross worked was made by George Washing- 
ton, and it contained stars with six points. Mrs. Ross 
suggested the use of the five-pointed star instead of the 
six-pointed English-design star. 
It was accepted by the committee and adopted by 
Congress for the “Stars and Stripes.” 
For some time Mrs. Ross was the official flag-maker 
appointed by the government. 
From 1777 to 1795 the flag bore thirteen stars and 
thirteen stripes; from 1795 to 1818, fifteen stars and fif- 
teen stripes; from 1818 to 1819, a star for every State 
and thirteen stripes. To-day there are forty-eight stars.

Along the street there comes 
A blare of bugles, a ruffle of drums, 
A flash of color beneath the sky.

And half a world away! 
Rose-red and blood-red 
The stripes forever gleam; 
Snow-white and soul-white— 
The good forefathers’ dream; 
Sky-blue and true-blue, with stars to gleam aright, 
The gloried guidon of the day; a shelter through the night.

To every star and stripe 
The drums beat as hearts beat, 
And fifers shrilly pipe.

I believe that my flag stands for honor, truth, and justice in

IT. My Duty to My Country 
Discuss duty to country; duty of intelligence and loy- 
alty. 
Our country is a free country—a democracy. 
By a free country we do not mean a country in which 
people may do as they please. A person is not free be- 
cause he does what he likes, but he is free because he is 
loyal, obedient, and does what he ought. 
In a country like ours, where the people rule, do their 
own thinking, and make their own laws, what kind of 
citizens should each of us be? 
Yes, we should be the most intelligent, loyal, and 
trustworthy men and women, boys and girls. You 
know a school is just as good and clean as the individual 
boys and girls who attend it; so a country is just as 
strong and great as the people composing it. 
You can help to make your country strong and great 
by each of you making the most out of yourself; not for 
your own sake but for the sake of all.

I believe it my duty to my country to love it; to support its 
Constitution; to honor its flag; to obey its laws, and to defend it 
against all enemies. —WILLIAM TYLER PAGE.

III. Qualities of Great Men 
Aim: Let this lesson call attention to some of the par- 
ticularly admirable qualities of our great men. Tell, or 
have some one tell, a story to illustrate Lincoln’s hon- 
esty. (The grocery store story.) Tell a story to illus- 
trate Washington’s honesty. (The story of his mother’s 
colt.) Have some incidents related that show kindness. 
(Lincoln helping the pig out of the mud.) Add others. 
In the same way study the quality of courage or bravery. 
Teach: 
“T’d like to be the sort of man the flag could boast about; 
I'd like to be the sort of man it cannot live without; 
I’d like to be the type of man that really is American: 
The head erect and shoulders square, 
Clean-minded fellow, just and fair, 
That all men picture when they see the glorious banner of the 
free. 
I'd like to be the sort of man the flag now typifies, 
The kind of man we really want the flag to symbolize; 
The loyal brother to a trust, the big unselfish soul and just, 
The friend of every man oppressed, the strong support of all 
that’s best, 
The sturdy chap the banner’s meant, where’er it flies, to repre- 
sent. 
   I'd like to be the sort of man the flag’s supposed to mean, 
The man that all in fancy see wherever it is seen, 
The chap that’s ready for a fight whenever there’s a wrong to 
right, 
The friend in every time of need, the doer of a daring deed, 
The clean and generous-handed man that is a real American.” 
Note : Make the learning of a poem always pleasurable, 
never a punishment. As far as possible see that chil- 
dren have the thought of a poem before teaching the
-P-A-G-E-334

  lines. Children, as well as their elders, enjoy finding 
fitting and pleasing expressions of thought they have 
had. 
IV. How to Fly the American Flag 
The flag should not be hoisted before sunrise or be 
allowed up after sunset. 
At “morning and evening colors” at forts and mili- 
tary posts civilian spectators should stand at attention 
and uncover during the playing of “The Star Spangled 
Banner.” 
The flag should never be allowed to touch the ground, 
and should never be raised or lowered by any mechanical 
appliance. 
When the national and State or other flags are flown 
together, the national flag should be on the right side of 
the building or lawn. 
When the flag is used as a banner, that is, suspended 
upon a rope across a street, the union, or field, should 
fly to the north in streets running east and west, and to 
the east in streets running north and south. 
The flag should always be flown from a staff or a 
mast, and should not be fastened to the side of a build- 
ing, platform, or scaffolding. 
When flags are used in an unveiling of a statue or 
monument, they should not be allowed to fall to the 
ground, but should be carried aloft to wave out, form- 
ing a distinctive feature during the remainder of the 
ceremony. 
When the flag is flown at half-staff as a sign of mourn- 
ing, it should be hoisted to full-staff at the end of the 
funeral. To fly a flag at half-staff, it must first be raised 
to full-staff and then lowered. On Memorial Day the 
     
   
             
    
-P-A-G-E-335
  CITIZENSHIP 317 
flag should fly at half-staff from sunrise to noon, and 
full-staff from noon to sunset. 
The following are the days when the flag should be 
displayed: 
Lincoln’s Birthday—February 12th. 
Washington’s Birthday—February 22d. 
Inauguration Day—(Every four years) March 4th. 
Mothers’ Day—Second Sunday in May. 
Memorial Day—(Half-staff until noon) May 3oth. 
Flag Day—June 14th. 
Battle of Bunker Hill—June 17th. 
Independence Day—July 4th. 
Labor Day—First Monday in September. 
Columbus Day—October 12th. 
Surrender of Yorktown—October roth. 
Armistice Day—November 11th. 
V. A Good American Citizen 
(a) Good Americans love their country. 
Discuss reasons for loving our country. 
Our country, Uncle Sam, is the best kind of father to 
us all. In some countries the people are always afraid 
of enemies who might come and take away or destroy 
their property. We are not afraid of that, for Uncle 
Sam would call out an army of soldiers to protect us and 
to punish all of those who would try to do us harm. 
Uncle Sam provides schools so that all the children in 
the land may go and receive an education. In some 
countries only the boys and girls whose parents are very 
rich can go to school. Schools cost a great deal of 
money. Uncle Sam, representing the American people, 
gives the schools to the children free. 
Uncle Sam looks out for us in all kinds of ways. 
 
-P-A-G-E-336
  318 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
The letters that we write he carries hundreds of miles. 
Our country has such good soil for raising food, we 
have never had a famine. 
Our country is rich in coal and iron and silver and 
gold. 
We want to obey Uncle Sam’s laws because they are 
all made to protect and help us. 
We should love our country more than ourselves. A 
good American citizen will not enrich himself at his coun- 
try’s expense. 
Children repeat “‘My Own United States.” 
“T love every inch of her prairie land, 
Every stone of her mountain side, 
I love every drop of the water clear 
That flows in her rivers wide. 
I love every tree, every blade of grass, 
Within Columbia’s gates; 
The Queen of the Earth is the land of my birth, 
My own United States.” 
(6) Good Americans love their country’s flag. 
Show that our flag is the emblem of all the good things 
Uncle Sam provides for us—liberty, education, and pro- 
tection. 
Discuss the care of our flag. 
The flag should never be allowed to touch the ground. 
The flag should never be draped around pillars or 
against walls or balustrades. 
Do not use the flag as a cover over a table, desk, or 
box, or where anything can be placed on it. 
The flags were made originally for the purpose of being 
flown, and to use them in any other manner is to misuse 
them. 
 
-P-A-G-E-337
  CITIZENSHIP 319 
Never throw into the street a worn-out or discarded 
flag. 
Recite the flag salute. 
Pledge your allegiance to the flag. 
Who can recite “Hats Off” ? 
All stand and repeat “Your Flag and My Flag.” 
Sing “Star Spangled Banner.” 
(c) A good American must master the English language. 
Are there any here who have never made a mistake 
either in speaking or writing our language? 
(Discuss the difficulty in learning to speak and write 
the English language correctly.) 
Tf it is difficult for us to learn our mother tongue, how 
much more difficult it is for the foreign child. 
Do you think foreigners should come to our country 
and then keep on speaking their own tongue and make 
no effort to learn our English language ? 
It will be difficult for them to learn our language, and 
how may we help them? 
(By repeating words and phrases slowly to fet by 
telling them the English names of things and places and 
people; by not laughing and jeering at their mistakes; 
by keeping our language pure, free from misuse or abuse 
in all that we speak or write.) 
If we wish the foreigner to learn our language and be- 
come American we must teach him to love America, to 
feel himself a part of it, to thrill at the sight of the flag 
and the strains of ““My Country, ’Tis of Thee.” 
We should strive to master the English language, be- 
cause it is the language of our country and the language 
of our forefathers; it has preserved for us a record of all 
the best things that our ancestors have thought or done. 
(d) An American must love liberty.

(The purpose of this lesson is to show that in this 
great republic, which is lighted by the torch of liberty, 
each person must take account of his duties and obliga- 
tions as well as his rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit 
of happiness.) 
Discuss with the children the meaning of liberty. 
Does it mean to do as one pleases? Not unless that 
one please to do what he ought, having in mind full re- 
gard for the rights of others. 
Discuss liberty in a good home. 
The child is early taught that while he enjoys the 
privileges of food, shelter, clothing, and kind treatment 
in the home, these things are to be shared with the 
family, and that these rights bring also certain obliga- 
tions. Each child should do his part in the home in the 
way of showing courtesy to others, obedience to parents, 
and by being helpful and cheerful. 
Our country is only our larger home, and we have 
seen that Uncle Sam does much for us. If he were really . 
our own kind uncle we should not be satisfied to have 
him do all, because we would want to do something for 
him. I wonder if there is anything we can do in return 
for his care of us. Every man who owns something in 
this country should be willing to pay Uncle Sam for pro- 
tecting it, whether it be a farm, a house in town, an 
automobile, or a dog, because without this protection 
the man’s property would not be safe. This money 
which should be paid to Uncle Sam in return for the 
protection of property is called taxes, and we should be 
willing to pay them cheerfully. 
It is in the time of war especially that Uncle Sam 
must ask us for help. He sent out a call for our boys 
and men between the ages of twenty-one and thirty-one,
-P-A-G-E-339
  
CITIZENSHIP 321 
and they responded as loyal citizens should. They gave 
up their work and bade goodby to mother, father, wife, 
and children, and home, and crossed the ocean at Uncle 
Sam’s bidding. It proved necessary that some of them 
give up even their lives in the struggle in order that we 
might be safe over here, and they did this without 
flinching. We must be as loyal and willing to do our 
part as they. Although we may not be called upon to 
pay our lives for our country, we are asked to be loyal 
and to give our money to help keep up expenses. 
Will you think of some ways in which we are asked to 
contribute? (Buy thrift stamps, bonds, and pay taxes.) 
How small these things are in comparison with the many 
privileges we enjoy here in America. We should be 
glad to give what Uncle Sam asks of us or more, too, if 
we are able. 
Sing “America.”

3. Be cheerful. 9. Share. 
4. Be prompt. 10. Fair play. 
5. Be helpful. 11. Be clean-minded. 
6. Be kind. 12. Be good. 
Discuss the relation of each of the above points to 
serving one’s country. Namely, the soldiers accepted 
by Uncle Sam were those who were clean and well. 
Cheerfulness helps us to keep well and to work and to 
play better. Only prompt people can be depended upon 
to perform a service. Helpfulness and kindness are only 
being polite and courteous to others, and such people

give the best service to their country. We work to have 
and save and share. We are good Americans only when 
we play fair with each other and with Uncle Sam. 
Clean-minded people have clean thoughts and clean 
mouths. Being good is acting so well that older people 
do not have to worry about you.

CHAPTER XVI 
THE MANAGEMENT OF SEAT WORK 
The management of seat work in the country schools 
is an important factor in the day’s activities. Some 
time should be devoted each day to construction work 
of various kinds. Children enjoy making things, and 
there are many ways in which paste, paper, cardboard, 
and other materials may be used. In planning projects 
for seat work, the teacher should be sure that the work 
will be truly educative. 
Principles to be Considered.—Every project should 
meet the following requirements: (a) it should be made 
for a definite purpose; (0) it should be suited to the child’s 
stage of development; (c) it should be interesting to the 
child; (d) it should encourage independence of thought; 
(e) it should be directly related to other school work; (f) 
it should have social value. 
In the primary division the work should center 
mainly around the home and the community. Too 
much emphasis should not be placed upon accuracy or 
precision. The chief aim should be the expression of 
ideas through material. 
Directing the Work.—Seat work is largely a manage- 
ment problem for the rural school teacher. Her time 
for such work is so limited that success will depend 
principally upon her ability to manage well the period 
devoted to it. The entire school should work on the 
same project, or phases of that project, at the same 
325
-P-A-G-E-344
  326 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
time. The teacher, therefore, must have her work well 
planned. 
A few good rules for the teacher to follow are: (a) 
discuss the project fully with the children and get them 
enthusiastic about it; (6) have all materials ready; (c) 
make directions clear, simple, and direct; (d) give di- 
rections for but one step at a time; (¢) insist upon care- 
ful attention; (f) distribute and collect material without 
waste of time; (g) use blackboard illustrations freely; 
(A) rather have a small amount of work well done than 
much attempted and poorly done; (¢) let the children 
independently do work similar to the project to test 
their initiative. 
Kinds of Projects.—There are many good educative 
projects for seat work. The rural teacher, however, 
must limit herself to comparatively few. She should be 
careful in her selection, and then carry them through to 
a successful completion. Interest in holidays and special 
occasions should be utilized. As Christmas approaches 
the making of appropriate gifts to parents should be 
‘planned. Also simple gifts to hospitals and to less for- 
tunate children. Making and dressing dolls have 
proven a very interesting and profitable project. It 
affords many valuable lessons in cost of material, suit- 
able dresses for all occasions, and harmony of color. 
Plasteline or clay modeling is interesting work for pri- 
mary grades. It trains the fingers and develops the 
child’s power of observation. After a preliminary les- 
son in which they are taught to use the tips of their 
fingers and thumbs rather than the palms of the hands, 
the pupils may be left to work by themselves while the 
teacher proceeds with other work. 
Because of its adaptability to all grades, the making

     THE MANAGEMENT OF SEAT WORK 327 
of boxes and booklets furnishes problems that may be 
easily given in rural schools. Directions for these two 
projects follow.* 
Box-Making.—We give our problems in construction 
when the need for them arises. There are many occa- 
sions demanding the use of boxes. In the fall we wish 
to put away the seeds that we are to plant in our gardens 
in the spripg. We wish to make boxes or baskets to. 
hold the nuts and raisins on our Thanksgiving table. 
Boxes are needed for enclosing spring blossoms as gifts. 
One opportunity-room became so skillful in the making 
of circular boxes that the pupils supplied the local 
florist with all the boxes for his Valentine Day trade. 
Boxes and baskets made of oak tag are useful about the 
garden. One boy made quart boxes of oak tag in which 
to market his berries. At Christmas time we need some 
baskets for table favors. Gifts that are small and light 
may be enclosed in a box and hung on the Christmas 
tree. Often a tiny gift is very precious, and we want 
to be very sure that it will reach the one for whom it is 
intended. It may be packed in soft white cotton, placed 
in a box, and hung safely on the tree. A gift enclosed 
in an attractive box may be made to assume an added 
value. 
Ready-made boxes covered with fancy papers in de- 
signs of holly, mistletoe, and poinsettia, though appro- 
priate at Christmas time, are usually not artistic. 
How a box may be made appropriate and artistic 
and how to construct a box for necessity’s sake are shown 
below. 
The children in the lowest grades may make small

boxes and baskets for the Christmas tree and fe the 
table. The simplest constructed box, without measur- 
ing, is made of a square of cover paper. Take a 4-inch 
square. It should not be a heavy paper. Crease in 
the center each way, and then again so as to obtain 
sixteen squares. Cut one folded side of each corner

square as in Fig. A. Then shape up the box and paste 
the corner laps to the inner parts of the sides. 
The lid is made in the same way that the bottom of 
the box is made, but from a slightly larger piece of 
paper. To remove the cover easily from the box, thumb 
notches may be placed on the opposite sides of the lid. 
Or the lid may be. more shallow than the box. 
If the creases are undesirable, or if a rectangular box 
is needed, then measurements must be made. Be sure 
to connect this work up with the arithmetic work. 
A set of dominoes and a box to contain them can be 
made by children of second-grade ability. 
 
-P-A-G-E-347
    THE MANAGEMENT OF SEAT WORK 329 
In the upper grades larger boxes may be made. 
Many uses will occur to the live teacher. The collec- 
tion of materials for science, the storage of small sup- 
plies, stick-printing boxes, and seat-work boxes furnish 
connections between the hand-work processes and the 
uses of box problems. 
If the box is to be large, such as the size of a half- 
pound candy box, heavy paper or thick cardboard 
should be used. Have old candy boxes brought in, 
soaked in water, and taken apart to illustrate ways of 
construction. Connect up box-making with a study of 
the industry. Study common factory methods of box 
and carton making and duplication. 
For our special upper-grade problem we will describe 
the making of a stick-printing box. 
Materials: The box is made of two pieces of light- 
weight lined chipboard for foundation, each 5 inches by 
7 inches; two pieces of engine paper for covering, each 
534 inches by 734 inches. The paper for the box should 
be left plain; the paper for the lid may be decorated 
appropriately. We will also need eight pieces of tissue 
or tracing paper, and eight pieces of thin cloth, each 34 
of an inch square, to support the four corners of the 
cover and the four corners of the box. 
Foundation: Take one piece of cardboard 5 by 7 
inches. Draw lines 34 of an inch from each edge on 
the gray side of the chipboard. Let the lines intersect 
at the corners. This will be for the cover of the box. 
The cover should be 3%; inch larger than the bottom 
of the box, so that it will fit easily over the box when 
covered. Lay out the bottom.of the box. Score along 
the lines indicating the sides. Scoring and creasing 
must be definite. Scoring may be done with the point 
 
-P-A-G-E-348
1 
330 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
of the scissors, but a knife is a better tool. Lay the 
ruler along the line where the scoring is to be done. 
Press hard enough to indent or cut the cardboard suffi- 
ciently to result in a sharp corner when bent up into 
position. Cut out the corners with the scissors. Bend 
up the sides, folding the scored side out. In this work 
it, is important that materials to be used by the class 
be tested out in folding, and especially in scoring. The 
problem must be executed by the teacher if she would 
avoid failure in the class work. Hold the sides in posi- 
tion by pasting the small pieces of tracing paper or 
newsprint around the corners. Strengthen the ‘corners 
with the small pieces of thin cloth. 
Covering: There are two common methods of cover- 
ing boxes, one as here described for the stick-printing 
box, and the other when a strip is pasted around the 
sides of the box, extending slightly over the top. .The 
top and bottom are finished with a rectangular piece of 
paper, leaving a margin of from 1 to % inch. 
For the stick-printing box, fit the covering to the 
box by wrapping it around the box, and, turning the 
edges in, crease it lightly with the fingers. Then, using 
these creases as guides, draw the layout. Lay it out 
flat on a piece of newspaper, cover all over with paste, 
and paste to box. 
Decoration: An appropriate design would be one 
made with stick-printing. In making the design with 
the little sticks, squares, circles, triangles, the back- 
ground spaces should be kept small and the whole 
should make a surface pattern. 
Sticks: The small sticks used for printing may be 
whittled out of soft wood, or may be made of 34-inch 
dowel-rod. The dowel-rod may be cut up into 14-inch 
 
-P-A-G-E-349
  THE MANAGEMENT OF SEAT WORK 331 
lengths, and the end of the stick whittled to the shape 
of a square or a triangle. 
Pans of Color: Pop bottle tops may serve for the 
little pans to hold the colors. Cut small pieces of felt 
to fit the pans. Or old soft white cloth may be doubled 
many times to form a pad and cut to lie down in the 
bottom of the pan. These pads are saturated with the 
colored mixture. 
Color: ‘Take opaque water-color and put enough water 
and mucilage (about half and half) in it to make it a 
little thicker than cream. The mucilage serves as a 
binder. Press the stick on the colored pad and then 
on the paper where we are making our design. By re- 
peating these little spots of color many interesting pat- 
terns can be worked out, depending, of course, on the 
inventive genius of the pupil. The piece of paper 
should be decorated before it is pasted to the box. 
One of the little stick-printing boxes purchased from 
any of the supply houses would serve as a guide in giv- 
ing a general idea and possibly in giving some help in 
making the little sticks. 
Booklet-Making.—Of all forms of construction work, 
booklet-making is perhaps most in demand. It is pro- 
gressive in its difficulty, and can be adapted to any grade 
of children. It is universal in its application. We 
come in contact with it every day. As a problem in 
handwork it can be made very much alive. Because of 
the many helps a variety as to kinds of booklets can be 
worked out by the teacher with her pupils. The older 
pupils can work quite independently of the teacher by 
the help of working drawings. The Industrial and Ap- 
plied Art Books,* and The Industrial Art Text Books,t 
* Mentzer Bush & Co., Chicago. { Laidlow Bros., Chicago.  
-P-A-G-E-350
332 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
give explicit working drawings and directions. The first 
four books of each set offer many suggestions to teach- 
ers for the lower grades, and Books Five, Six, Seven, 
and Eight contain easily read working-drawings for the 
older pupils. After a few of the simpler basic prin- 
ciples like pasting and sewing have been taught, the 
older pupils can make the booklets from the drawings. 
Children below fifth grade ability should not make 
books involving surface-pasting. The range of ma- 
terials needed for booklet-making is not great, and they 
can be easily obtained. Careful planning and measur- 
ing by the pupil are essential. Neatness, cleanliness, 
and accuracy should result from the process. It should 
also produce a higher respect for books, and can be 
made to function in the preservation of books. 
Sand-Table Projects.—A sand-table is an indispensa- 
ble piece of apparatus in every rural school. | It offers 
an excellent opportunity for pupils to express their 
ideas freely. It also develops their creative powers. 
In chapter VII directions were given for making a 
sand-table or sand-tray. Projects for the sand-table 
grow out of so many of the school’s regular activities 
that several tables might easily be kept in use if space 
and time would permit. The teacher should be care- 
ful to always make the sand-table project a means and 
not the end. The following list of projects should 
grow out of the language, reading, and the general les- 
sons, and can be used advantageously:

CHAPTER XVII 
MEASURING THE RESULTS OF TEACHING 
Ever since schools have existed, teachers and school 
officers have sought to measure the abilities and achieve- 
ments of pupils. Can it be successfully done, or are 
the results of teaching so complex and intangible as to 
make it impossible to measure them? There are those 
who argue that the influences of the teacher’s work can 
be determined only after the pupils have attained ma- 
turity and have demonstrated their fitness or unfitness 
for the duties of life. They believe that the most im- 
portant element in the training of children for social 
efficiency is instilling ideals of industry, cleanliness, pa- 
triotism, truthfulness, personal honor. They also say 
that it is impossible to measure the extent to which such 
ideals have been implanted. 
Tangible Results.—It is true that some of the results 
of teaching will always be of an intangible nature; it is 
equally true that much of the school work is tangible 
and can be measured. 
The pupil should acquire as a result of his training, 
besides the ideals already mentioned, a certain number 
of fixed habits and a certain capital of knowledge. Since 
the habits which he acquires can be quite definitely 
labeled and enumerated, the teacher should have little 
difficulty in determining, with reasonable accuracy, the 
progress of a pupil in that respect. It shall be our pur- 
pose in this chapter, therefore, to deal with the measur- . 
335 
 
-P-A-G-E-354
  336 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
ing of that other element in the training of the child, 
viz., the acquisition of his capital of knowledge. 
Need for Measuring in Rural Schools.—To no one 
in the teaching profession is the thorough understanding 
of the measuring of pupils’ abilities and achievements 
so essential as to the teacher of the one-room rural school. 
The importance of studying thoroughly the latest and 
most successful ways of testing and measuring cannot 
be too strungly urged upon the rural teacher. 
Let us notice some of the problems peculiar to the 
one-teacher rural school which make it essential that 
the teacher should understand measuring. 
1st. Small Classes ——Many of the pupils in our rural 
schools are alone in their classes, or, at best, have but 
one classmate. It is difficult for the teacher, in such 
cases, to know whether the pupils are making the prog- 
ress that they can and should make. She cannot rely 
upon the average attainment of such a class, as can the 
teacher, for instance, with one grade of thirty pupils. 
What she needs, then, is some definite and reliable stand- 
ard whereby she can measure the progress that her 
pupils are making. Especialiy is this true when that 
pupil who is alone in his class is also irregular in his at- 
tendance at school, as is so frequently the case. 
2d. Combining and Alternating Classes.—One of the 
difficult problems of the rural teacher is reducing the 
large number of classes that she has per day. In the 
chapter on the “Daily Program,” ways and means are 
suggested for the solution of that problem. Two of the 
ways recommended are by combining and by alternating 
classes. Certain dangers are involved in these methods. 
When combining, for instance, the fifth and the sixth 
year pupils in reading for recitation purposes, calling it
-P-A-G-E-355
           MEASURING RESULTS OF TEACHING 337 
the “B” division, the teacher must guard against the 
danger of retarding the more advanced pupils and, on 
the other hand, of advancing other pupils too rapidly 
for thorough work. 
The alternation of classes may be carried out in sev- 
eral different ways. Whatever the method, the teacher 
must bear in mind that the total amount of time de- 
voted to a given subject by a pupil during the year is 
reduced and that as a result of such reduction of time 
there is danger that the pupil will be retarded. In 
both cases, then, it is again essential that the teacher 
should have at her command a yardstick that is reliable. 
3d. Pupils Moving from One School to Another — 
The increase of tenantry among farmers has resulted 
in a constant increase in the changes of residence among 
farmers during the school year. The teacher of the 
rural school is, as a result of those changes, frequently 
confronted with the problem of classifying new pupils. 
Contrast her situation with that of the teacher in a 
graded school system. When a pupil presents himself 
for admission to a’graded school, he is sent to the super- 
intendent or principal of that school, and that official 
decides upon his classification. The teacher in the rural 
school, on the other hand, is so far removed from her 
supervising official, usually the county superintendent, 
that she must, except in the most extreme cases, assume 
the responsibility herself. In other words, she must 
act in the capacity of principal as well as of teacher. 
And, unfortunately in the matter of classification, her 
task is much more difficult than is that of the principal 
of a graded school. Her pupils come from schools in 
which it is impossible to have the same degree of uni- 
formity in classification and promotion of pupils as in
-P-A-G-E-356
    
338 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
graded schools. For the purpose of classification, then, 
as well as measuring progress, the rural teacher needs a 
measuring stick that is accurate and reliable. 
Examinations.—Written examinations have been the 
conventional school tests. Do they meet the needs of 
the rural teacher? 
It must be admitted that examinations may be of 
value if rightly used; it may be very emphatically said 
that there are serious objections to their use and that 
better ways of testing are now available. 
ist. The Examination Questions—Questions prepared 
by teachers for examinations vary so in difficulty that 
it is practically impossible to compare children on that 
basis from year to year or from different school systems. 
2d. Too Great Variation in Teachers’ Marks.—Many 
factors enter into the causes for wide variation in teach- 
ers’ markings. The same teacher will give a widely 
different value to the same paper under different cir- 
cumstances. Papers graded at the close of a trying day 
at school will not receive the same marks as when 
graded after a night’s rest. Again, two different teach- 
ers will differ greatly in their estimation of the value of 
a given answer to a question. 
3d. Evil Effects Upon the Pupil.—Objections to ex- 
aminations are frequently made because of the effect 
they have upon pupils. Some objections are: (a) They 
lead pupils to “cramming” for the examination rather 
than to acquiring abilities that will be useful in later 
life. (6) They tempt children to be dishonest. Such 
terms as “bluffing,” “cribbing,” and “spotting the 
teacher”? are so well known among the students of 
to-day as to make further evidence on this point un- 
necessary. (c) The examination, if it stimulates any-
-P-A-G-E-357
   MEASURING RESULTS OF TEACHING 339 
one, stimulates the pupil that needs it least, that is, 
the oversensitive and ambitious one. (d) The physical 
strain arising from examinations causes nervous break- 
downs and gives many children a horror of school. 
Standard Tests.—One of the most recent educational 
developments is the use of “Standard Tests.” Two 
things make these tests useful. First, they have been - 
carefully constructed by scientific experts. Second, 
standards for these tests have been scientifically pre- 
pared, and the results of tests may be readily compared 
with those standards. 
It will be impossible to discuss adequately, in a single 
chapter, this important subject in modern education. 
We must restrict ourselves to a discussion of the useful- 
ness of such tests in the management of a one-teacher 
school. 
We shall consider their use from three standpoints, 
viz.: (a) as a guide in classification; () to measure from 
time to time the progress made by pupils, and (¢) to 
diagnose pupils’ difficulties along certain lines. 
For Classification.—A teacher, when she enters upon 
her duties in a rural school, should know that her pupils 
are properly classified. Her first use for a standard 
test, therefore, will be for that purpose. 
The construction of a single group of tests for the 
purpose of measuring the past achievement of all the 
school in its entire program of subjects, is the newest’ 
development in the field of testing. We have had for 
several years many tests, but each covered only a small 
part of the ground that the average teacher or superin- 
tendent desired to cover. The Standard Achievement 
Test* aims to remedy this situation for grades 2-8. It 
* Published by World Book Co., Yonkers, N. Y.
-P-A-G-E-358
  340 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
covers all of the ground that it is necessary to cover 
for ordinary purposes of school or pupil measurement. 
The test is easily administered. A manual containing 
full directions, both as to the giving of the test and the 
utilization of the results, can be obtained from the pub- 
lishers. The teacher who is in doubt, therefore, as to 
whether her school is properly classified, should avail 
herself of such help. The proper procedure would be 
to consult the county superintendent about the matter 
and through him procure the necessary material. This 
having been done, the teacher should then give the test, 
score the papers, chart her results, and submit the same, 
together with her suggestions as to remedies, to the 
county superintendent for his approval. After she has 
her school well classified, she should have little diffi- 
culty in applying the same test to new pupils who enter 
from other schools. Also when a pupil from her school 
moves to another school, she will be able to give to the 
pupil’s new teacher a statement of his “educational 
quotient,”’ or accomplishment, that is based upon the 
most scientific and reliable information available. 
Measuring Progress.—After the school has been 
properly classified, the industrious teacher will want to 
know whether her pupils are making the progress that 
should be made. There are many good tests available 
for that purpose. In arithmetic, for instance, the teacher 
should know what progress her pupils are making in 
their work in the fundamental operations. The Courtis 
tests in arithmetic,* which consist of a series of prob- 
lems in the fundamentals that are of equal difficulty, 
may be given periodically and the results charted.

                        MEASURING RESULTS OF TEACHING 
  On the subject of reading, Monroe* says concerning 
the use of the Monroe Standardized Silent Reading 
Tests in the rural schools: “In a rural school it will be 
most convenient to test all of the pupils above. the 
second grade at one time. In recording the scores, it 
will, of course, be necessary to record the scores for the 
different grades separately. These silent reading tests 
are not teaching devices. They are instruments for 
measuring the ability of pupils to read silently. They 
should be given at the beginning of the school year so 
that the teacher may know her pupils better. If they 
are not used at the beginning of the year, they may be 
given at any time, preferably as early as convenient. 
The tests should be repeated at the end of the year, so 
that the teacher may know how much his pupils have 
increased their ability to read silently. When the 
tests are given a second time a different form should be 
used. If it is desired, the tests may be given a third 
time at the middle of the year, but they should not be 
given more than three times a year.” 
In handwriting, charts have been prepared which give 
samples of writing from the very poorest to that which 
is perfect. Wilson and Hoke} say: “If a teacher has 
not been accustomed to make use of scales and stand- 
ardized tests in her work of grading, she would do well 
to begin with the subject of writing. Writing is one of 
the mechanical subjects, and one of the most easily 
and quickly measured. In order to avoid confusion 
on her part, she should study and practise scientific 
measurement in this subject alone until she has become 
reasonably proficient.”

  342 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
  For Diagnostic Purposes.—The writer recently ad- 
ministered the Standard Achievement Test to a typical 
one-teacher rural school. When the papers were scored 
it was found that one pupil was strong, with but one 
exception, in all of his work. That one exception was 
in the arithmetic “computation” test. This test mea- 
sures the ability of a pupil as to speed and accuracy in 
the fundamental operations. What is the problem of 
the teacher of that pupil? It is much the same as the 
problem of the physician when he is called to the bed- 
side of a patient, that is, to determine the cause of the 
ailment and then to apply the proper remedy. 
Monroe says: “A few years ago Stone investigated 
the nature of ability in arithmetic, and concluded that 
it was made up of a number of specific abilities. His 
conclusions have been corroborated by a number of 
other investigations, and it is now reasonably certain 
that in teaching the operations of arithmetic, we are 
attempting to engender a number of specific abilities 
which are relatively distinct; and not a single arithmetical 
ability. The word ‘ability’ is used to refer to rate and 
accuracy with which a pupil does a certain type of ex- 
ample. ‘Teachers have recognized that pupils could do 
subtraction examples in which there was no ‘borrow- 
ing’ when they were unable to do examples in which 
there was ‘borrowing,’ or that they could do short divi- 
sion when they were unable to do long division. The 
investigations of Stone and others have proven that 
there are as many different abilities as there are types 
of examples.” 
Tests should be used, then, to diagnose the cause of a 
pupil’s weakness in a subject. In arithmetic it may be 
due to the fact that the pupil has never mastered cer-
-P-A-G-E-361
  MEASURING RESULTS OF TEACHING 343 
tain portions of the multiplication table or of the forty- 
five combinations. 
Poor comprehension in reading may be due to a lack 
of vocabulary. Whatever the cause, when the right 
diagnosis has been made, the teacher can intelligently 
set herself to the task of administering the »roper 
remedy. 
Tests Used to Stimulate Interest—The Standard 
Tests can be used by the teacher as an effective means 
for stimulating the pupil’s interest in his school work. 
This is especially true in the rural scnool where the pupil 
has no competition. Such a pupil can be shown where 
he stands in comparison with other children of his own 
age. It becomes his problem, then, to meet that stand- 
ard, and every bit of progress made by him will be en- 
couragement for a still greater effort. What an in- 
centive to a pupil to have his teacher say to him: 
“Johnny, three months ago you added correctly six 
problems of the test in the time I gave you, and to-day 
you have added eight. The standard for your age, 
however, is ten problems. Let us work hard now in 
the next three months so that you will be able to meet 
that standard.” 
The individual score sheet in arithmetic, illustrated 
below, makes it possible for a child to see at a glance 
how he compares with the standard set by other chil- 
dren of his own age. It also enables him to see his own 
rate of progress. 
The plan is to have posted upon the wall a score 
sheet for each individual pupil. With black ink mark 
in each column the number that corresponds to the 
standard fixed for that test. Then with a ruler draw 
a line from each number so marked to the next. 
 
-P-A-G-E-362
  344 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
After the first test, given in September or October, 
mark in each column in red ink the number that corre- 
sponds to the pupil’s score. Then with a ruler draw 
with red ink a line from each number so marked to the 
next. By comparing the two curves the pupil can tell 
how much his scores are above or below the standard. 
In February and May the tests should be given again 
and the results marked on the score sheet, but each 
time with a different colored ink. Thus the progress or 
lack of progress will stand out’ prominently for each 
pupil.

CHAPTER XVIII 
DISCIPLINE 
Order is heaven’s first law. In a well-disciplined 
school, “discipline” is conspicuous by its absence. In 
an army, discipline is the most essential element to suc- 
cess. When the men are not under discipline, then those 
in authority can accomplish nothing. Such a condition 
leads to low morale. Likewise, in the schoolroom a lack 
of discipline and order means chaos. A leader of any 
group or organization, if he would succeed, must first 
see to it that order and discipline reign. It is well, then, 
to admonish every teacher to be able to recognize dis- 
order and poor discipline, and to fix in her mind the one 
slogan, ‘Order and Discipline First.” ae will mean 
that the teacher who finds disorder cretping into the 
class will stop all procedure and secure order, even if it 
takes the rest of the period. -The disorder must cease 
or the cause must be removed. If teachers will live up 
to such an ideal, and if boys and girls know that they 
are being taught by teachers who are determined to have 
order, our schools will turn out far better citizens. 
Waste in education will be materially lessened. Chil- 
dren are perfectly human. As soon as they discover 
that they must behave and work, they will do so. But 
the child who will work and attend to his best interests 
without being guided by a determined teacher is the 
exception. The best cannot be done if discipline is 
wanting. 
Discipline—Discipline in its broadest sense means 
training and instruction; improvement by corrective 
346
-P-A-G-E-365
  DISCIPLINE 347 
methods; submission of the learner or disciple to drill 
and constant guidance. School discipline does not con- 
cern itself at all times with “bad boys and girls” only, 
but with an everlasting vigil over the sum total of a 
child’s activities. It is well for the teacher to recognize 
at the outset that there may be conditions within the 
schoolroom or within her own personality which may 
prevent good discipline. 
Physical Conditions of Schoolroom.—In Chapter VI 
much stress has been placed upon the physical conditions 
of the schoolroom. Lighting, seating, ventilation, heat- 
ing, and humidity were discussed and the ideal in each 
case was urged. The reason for demanding these ideals 
was not that more money might be spent, but that the 
boys and girls might be comfortable. Comfort begets 
discipline and order. A child who is cold cannot study. 
He is bound to become restless. The child breathing 
foul air will become sleepy and listless and will attempt 
to wake himself by some invented activity. If teachers 
and school authorities could see the direct relation be- 
tween comfort and discipline, there would be less diffi- 
culty in securing needed repairs and necessary equip- 
ment in our schools. 
Physical Condition of Pupils —Another common cause 
for disorder in the schoolroom is the physical condition 
of the pupils. A child who has poor eyesight and can- 
not read the work on the blackboard, or who cannot 
read charts and maps, is likely to lose interest in his 
work and become inattentive. Inattention leads to 
disorder. ‘The same can be said of poor hearing. In an 
indirect but forceful way all physical defects, such as 
bad teeth, malnutrition, adenoids, enlarged tonsils, and 
the great number of defects so common among too many 
 
-P-A-G-E-366
  348 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT : 
of the children of our schools have a very marked influ- 
ence on the attention, interest, and order of the schools. 
The Teacher.—The teacher is discussed in the chapter 
that follows. Her personal, professional, and physical 
traits are enumerated. These traits sum up the total 
of a teacher’s personality and her attitude toward the 
teaching profession. 
It is impossible to say, without too lengthy a discus- 
sion, which of those qualities are the greatest influence 
in discipline. It is reasonable to infer without discus- 
sion, however, that “poise,” ‘“‘tact,’”’ “good health,” 
“even temper,” “thorough preparation,” “‘a good voice,” 
“sympathy,” “sincerity,” and ‘‘fairness” are especially 
necessary to good discipline. Of course it goes without 
saying that the teacher is responsible for discipline. But 
to say that the teacher may be the only factor in the 
way of good discipline would no doubt shock some 
teachers. This fact must be driven home. Too many 
teachers who have poor discipline blame every other 
factor, but overlook themselves. 
Altitude of Parents.—As suggested in other chapters, 
parents and teachers need to co-operate. Teachers can- 
not be entirely successful in disciplining a child whose 
parents do not appreciate that behavior is necessary in 
organized society. Parents who are inclined to look 
upon the actions of their child as a mark of “cuteness,” 
or who excuse him on the ground of his parental ances- 
tors, are not in sympathy with sound discipline. Some- 
times parents are very indulgent with their children, 
and do not see the errors they commit. A teacher can 
well afford to spend time with such parents in attempt- 
ing to set them right. When parents do co-operate with 
the teacher, there is little trouble in discipline. If they
-P-A-G-E-367
  DISCIPLINE 349 
criticize when she makes a definite stand for order, she 
is very much handicapped. Would that teachers and 
parents could stand as a unit in this matter. 
Lack of Playground Supervision —A playground un- 
supervised may be a hotbed of disorder. In the chapter 
on Physical Education much stress is placed upon play- 
ground supervision. Children will do many things in 
groups and cliques on the unsupervised playground that 
they would not think of doing any place else. Many of 
the petty quarrels and misunderstandings are carried 
into the schoolroom. The teacher under these condi- 
tions is unaware of the difficulty. She has handicapped 
herself by being absent from the playground. Children 
that are busy playing wholesome games every minute 
will not have time for anything else. The wise teacher 
will thus engage her boys and girls at every intermission. 
She will plan for intermissions as well as for class work. 
Distracting Influences—Anything that tends to de- 
tract from the work in the schoolroom would be classed 
as a distracting influence. Playgrounds situated too 
near the open window or open unshaded windows too 
close to a busy street or public highway are very bad 
and tend to take attention away from school work. 
Unnecessary noises, such as the giving of loud signals for 
passing of classes, tapping of bells, and the noisy, boister- 
ous rattle of a nervous teacher, all tend to make atten- 
tion difficult. On the other hand, a quiet, orderly bear- 
ing on the part of the teacher and the pupils is conducive 
to easy attention. 
How to SECURE AND Marntarn DISCIPLINE 
Make School Work Interesting.—All the devices and 
methods that teachers can collect and use wisely make 
 
-P-A-G-E-368
350 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
school work more interesting. Interest keeps out the 
disturbing intruders. The child who likes his work and 
applies himself diligently has no time to get out of order. 
An experienced teacher knows that disorder means 
a lack of interest. The best advice for a beginning 
teacher would be: Increase interest by proper choice of 
subject-matter and good incentives. A lack of interest 
suggests that the teacher should look at herself. She is 
perhaps teaching from a ‘‘stagnant pool.” 
Make Definite Stands.—A teacher must have definite 
convictions in matters of discipline. After having taken 
careful thought concerning certain conduct, nothing 
adds to a teacher’s power more than making careful de- 
cisions and then standing by them. Evenness of con- 
trol not only wins confidence but it establishes correct 
habits. Teachers cannot afford to be “easy” one day 
and “cranky” the next. 
Procrastination is a special type of weakness among 
inexperienced teachers. Putting off until some other 
day or waiting until a more opportune time is a very 
bad habit. Sometimes children do little odd things that 
are not really bad, and the inexperienced teacher is in- 
clined to wait, hoping that it will not happen again. 
The teacher must have the ability to sense such disturb- 
ances, and know almost intuitively whether or not an 
act on the part of the pupil is against good discipline. 
Of course a’ teacher can act too hastily. Sometimes she 
must bide her time. 
Be Square——Nothing adds to the power of a disci- 
plinarian so much as the ability to weigh difficulties and 
to arrive at unbiased decisions. The teacher should be 
sure that she has all the evidence on both sides of the 
question and then base her decision upon what she de- 
 
-P-A-G-E-369
DISCIPLINE 351 
termines to be right. It is usually well to let the child 
know just why such a decision has been reached. 
Mechanize Routine—Many details of management 
could be made much easier about a school if the pupils 
knew what they were to do and were then required to 
do it. Marching into the building, passing materials, 
dismissals, securing and putting on winter wraps, and 
the passing of classes can all be done orderly when pupils 
understand what they are to do. The teacher must 
know the best method and then require the pupils to 
follow that method each time. Thus much confusion 
and unnecessary noise will be eliminated. 
The wise teacher will make use of routine whenever 
she can and thus save time and energy. 
Have Few Rules.—‘ Few rules rigidly enforced”’ is one 
of the first principles of school management. In general, 
rules should not be made until a need arises. If the 
teacher announces certain rules because she anticipates 
the need for them, she may omit the one that will be 
most needed. The mischievous pupil will be sure to 
notice the omission and will proceed to take advantage 
of it. As suggested elsewhere in this text, one rule for 
children will settle most cases. That rule is “Do Right.” 
Normal children know right from wrong. An appeal to 
that knowledge when rightly made will make it possible 
for the teacher to put her pupils upon their own honor. 
Have an Impersonal Attitude.—Personal feelings must 
not enter into a punishment case. The child must not 
be made to feel that his act was against the teacher. If 
he does, she will find herself in the attitude of fighting 
for her rights and desperately making rules to overcome 
her enemies. The teacher mut show the child that his 
actions are not against the teacher, but against law and 
 
-P-A-G-E-370
  352 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
order. If he is punished he must understand that he 
has violated some outstanding law. 
Common Sense.—This topic is discussed in the next 
chapter, and needs notice here simply as a factor in se- 
curing good order. A teacher who does not apply com- 
mon sense in the management of her school will not 
succeed. : 
Use Proper Incentives.—The desires that impel a child 
- to effort are called motives or incentives. Incentives are 
of two kinds, natural and artificial. Since knowledge is 
a natural result of study, it is a natural incentive. A 
mother promises her daughter a beautiful sewing set for 
faithful study during the next month. This is artificial 
because the sewing set is not a natural consequence of 
study. Artificial incentives are substitutes for natural. 
As such they become the immediate ends and divert 
attention from true ends. 
In the pioneer school artificial incentives were com- 
mon. Many teachers resorted to prizes, head marks, 
privileges, and exemptions from class work as excellent 
means of securing interest. The characteristic feature 
of such artificial incentives is a race between one or two 
good pupils in the class and a continuous discourage- 
ment for the poorer pupils. Too often envy and hard 
feelings are the final result. Artificial incentives are, 
however, not always dangerous. There are times when 
they can be used to advantage if the teacher uses them 
with care. Natural incentives impel men throughout 
their lives. Every end foreseen, whether to gain good 
or to shun evil, awakens an impulse to effort. The 
teacher should hold before her pupils as many of the 
natural incentives as possible. She should attempt to 
stimulate and encourage a child in striving for goals that
-P-A-G-E-371
   DISCIPLINE 353 
will help him to become a better citizen. The natural 
incentives in school life are numerous, but they range 
from the selfish to the highest and purest joys of life. 
According to E. E. White, in his School Management, 
royal incentives are arranged in an ascending order of 
their worth as follows: 
1. Desire for good standing. 
2. Desire for approbation. 
Desire for knowledge. 
Desire for efficiency. 
Desire for self-control. 
. Desire for future good. 
. Sense of honor. 
. Sense of right. 
Sense of duty. © OM AUB YW 
PUNISHMENTS 
Purposes.—One of the most obvious facts in life is that 
pain and loss follow the violation of law. 
But pain and loss in themselves are not the only aims 
of punishment. Punishment should follow wrong-doing 
for three purposes: (1) To punish the wrongdoer. (2) 
To prevent future violation on the part of the one being 
punished and others who may be influenced thereby. 
(3) To put the stamp of condemnation on wrong-doing. 
Characteristics of Good Punishment.—Punishment 
should be certain. Certainty of punishment is more im- 
portant than its severity. Mild punishments admin- 
istered uniformly will have much better effect than 
severe fitful punishments. One needs only to refer to 
various well-known governments of the world and notice 
the results of their law enforcement. Those nations 
that have strong laws and see that they are enforced are
-P-A-G-E-372
354 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
the most successful. The teacher will do well to remem- 
ber this. 
Punishment Must Be Just.—Punishment should bear 
a just relation to the offense. The child who has been 
an offender must feel that his punishment is just and 
not too severe. On the other hand, a punishment that 
is too light causes the child to hold in contempt the 
whole scheme of control. Such punishment does more 
harm than good. Teachers sometimes use the same 
type of punishment for different offenses. This becomes 
serious because children can see no justice in it. They 
can usually reason as well about such things as an adult. 
Should Be Natural.—Punishments would have a 
greater effect if every offense could be punished with a 
natural loss of privilege or pleasure. In this Nature is 
the perfect example. The boy who sticks his tongue on 
an iron pump-handle on a cold morning immediately 
learns his lesson. The teacher, in each case possible, 
should inflict the natural punishment because the effect 
is the more excellent. The child is somehow convinced 
without any question of the justice of the penalty and 
accepts the situation without a word. If a pupil has 
abused a privilege, he will easily see that to lose it is just 
and right. A boy that persists in tormenting the little 
children during intermissions should not object to ‘tak- 
ing his recess alone at some other time. The boy who 
has a new knife and persists in cutting his desk should 
forfeit his knife until time to go home. The teacher 
should study to apply natural punishments, because of 
the excellent results usually obtained. 
Every teacher must be her own judge in the light of 
the above discussion as to what type of punishment will 
bring the best results. The following types of punish--+ 
 
-P-A-G-E-373
DISCIPLINE 355 
ment are discussed in order that the beginning teacher 
may profit from the experience of others. 
Heart-to-Heart Talks—The average pupil who has 
been found doing something wrong can be corrected with 
a quiet “heart-to-heart” talk. Eighty-five to ninety 
per cent of all difficulties in school discipline can be cor- 
rected and pupils made to see the error of their ways if 
teachers will quietly talk things over with them. The 
teacher will accomplish more by doing that than by the 
use of any other means. ‘The teacher is reasonable and 
not angry; she shows the pupil the results of his beha- 
vior not only upon himself but upon the school, and 
usually by an honest, straightforward discussion the 
pupil sees and admits his mistake. This, then, is the 
first step to take when disciplinary difficulties arise. 
Semi-public Reproof—The teacher has talked to a ~ 
child. The child still persists in his misbehavior. What 
shall she do then? It is difficult to give the remedy 
without knowing all the factors that enter into the par- 
ticular case. When the offense occurs in the presence 
of other students in the schoolroom, a semi-public re- 
proval should be given. The teacher should go to the 
pupil and in a quiet but firm manner reprove him for 
his act. If the offense was quite serious, a more public 
reproval may be given. In all events, any method of 
public reproval must be dealt with very carefully. Such 
methods sometimes border upon nagging and sarcasm, 
and no action on the part of a teacher is more inexcusa- 
ble and contemptible than such a habit. There is no 
place for sarcasm in any well-organized school. 
More ‘Severe Punishment.—A pupil who has been 
spoken to in a kind way privately and who has been re- 
proved in a semi-public or a public way, and who still 
 
-P-A-G-E-374
  356 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
persists in offending, must be dealt with more severely in 
accordance with the offense. There are many kinds of 
punishment that might be administered, but the age 
and disposition of the child must be considered before 
deciding. If the pupil is in the high school, perhaps 
suspension is the best punishment. For a child in the 
grades some sane form of corporal punishment may be 
most effective. Corporal punishment will be discussed 
later. 
In the preceding paragraph the discussion has followed 
a child through three stages of misconduct and deals 
with him in an ascending scale of severity. 
The following types of punishment have been used 
with different degrees of success. They must be used 
with care and consideration. 
Satiation as a Penalty.—Punishment through satiation, 
though effective, is not often used. The results are too 
often injurious before the offender has been made to re- 
pent. However, cases could be given where the results 
were very satisfactory. For instance, a teacher has been 
annoyed by the pupils going to the waste-basket with 
small bits of paper. One pupil made several trips during 
the course of one period. The teacher requested that 
this practice be stopped, and told the pupils to keep all 
waste paper at their seats, and it could be dropped in 
the waste-paper basket as they passed out for recess or 
dismissal. Every one obeyed, except one boy, who 
wanted to see if the teacher meant what she said. He 
went to the basket three or four times, keeping one eye . 
on the teacher as she was conducting a class near by. 
The teacher said nothing, but, after the period was over, 
went to the waste basket and took out two or three good- 
sized pieces of waste paper and tore them into many
-P-A-G-E-375
          DISCIPLINE 357 
small pieces. She scattered them all over the floor, not 
far from the boy’s desk. He was then required to pick 
up each piece separately and carry it to the basket. The 
boy never disregarded this request again, and others re- 
ceived a lesson as well. If the teacher can “beat” the 
mischievous youngster at his own game he will respect 
her for it. 
Withdrawal of Privileges —This method of punishment 
has been referred to before, but it must be mentioned 
here as one of the effective means of punishment. A 
child who persists in talking while at the library should 
not be allowed the privilege of the library until he can 
conduct himself properly. To be a member of a class 
or to be in school is a privilege, and the pupil who dis- 
turbs the group should be removed for the benefit of 
those who care to give attention. Of course, some 
children would be glad to lose such privileges. The 
teacher must know how best to handle the case in 
hand. 
Conferring with Parents—Much has been said in this 
book about the co-operation of teachers and parents. 
Again it must be said that many difficulties in discipline 
could be avoided if teachers and parents would talk over 
these problems. The teacher’s influence will be much 
stronger if the pupil knows that his parents and the 
teacher are working together. On the contrary, the 
teacher is greatly hindered if the pupil knows there is no 
common bond of agreement between her and his parents. 
Sometimes the home influence is entirely against the 
teacher in all matters of discipline. This often brings 
about.difficult situations. The teacher should not hesi- 
tate to take up a bad case of discipline with the parents 
or guardian.   
-P-A-G-E-376
358 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
Suspension and Corporal Punishment.—These two 
types of punishment have been placed last because every 
possible means known to a teacher should be used before 
these. Especially is this true of the latter. Small boys 
and girls under twelve years of age certainly should not 
be suspended from school. Too often this would meet 
with their approval. Boys and girls over fourteen years 
of age—who know the value of school—may perhaps be 
suspended as the final effort to put down disorder in the 
school. 
Corporal punishment should never be used until every 
other means has been tried, and then only for insubordi- 
nate and rebellious pupils. If corporal punishment must 
be used, the following cautions and suggestions should 
be followed. In some cases every one should be ob- 
served; others might not need such careful consideration: 
(t) Never administer when angry. 
(2) Corporal punishment, when inflicted, should be 
with a rubber tube applied below the loins rather than 
upon the body or the hands. 
(3) Do not use a ruler on the palm or back of the 
hands. 
(4) Do not hit children over the head with a book, 
slap them, or pull their ears. 
(5) It is better not to punish before other pupils. 
(6) Ask an adult to be present if possible. 
(7) Consult parents and let them know your inten- 
tions and why. 
(8) Keep a record of offenses and your method of 
treatment.

CHAPTER XIX 
POINTS OF EMPHASIS IN CLASSROOM PROCEDURE 
From the various methods of classroom instruction, 
the effective teacher chooses those which most nearly 
meet the needs of the pupils as well as the nature of the 
subject in hand. There are various means of leading 
the child to master the same lesson. The proper choice 
of these constitutes the professional phase of teaching, 
just as the ability to diagnose well determines the pro- 
fessional skill of the medical world. 
This chapter has to do with the following types of 
procedure, which are among those more commonly used 
in the classroom. 
(1) Telling exercise or lecture method. 
(2) Object lesson. 
(3) The inductive lesson. 
(4) The appreciation lesson. 
(5) Habit formation. 
(6) Teaching pupils) how to study. 
(7) The project. 
(8) The assignment. 
(9) The recitation. 
Telling Exercise—Years ago, when the school aimed 
to educate the few, and when the securing of knowledge 
_ was the chief purpose, the lecture method held an im- 
portant place in the classroom. To-day this method is 
looked upon as the road of least resistance, since it is 
much easier for the teacher to tell the whole story than 
361 a
-P-A-G-E-380
  362 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
to formulate questions and to develop a point that the 
child may be led to think. 
To be sure, the lecture method is sometimes of value, 
especially if the teacher desires to bring in some of her 
experience to illustrate points in the lesson, but this 
must not be used to the exclusion of other and better 
methods. 
Many college classes are taught entirely by the purely 
lecture method, simply because instructors assume that 
college students can grasp ideas that are more or less 
abstract. This idea is perhaps correct if a college is an 
institution of technical instruction, basing such instruc- 
tion upon experimentation or survey, whose clients are 
real students, but if this college is to take the beginner 
and connect him “up” with new facts that are hazy in 
the mind of the young student, then the instructor must 
play the réle of a teacher and develop the learner’s power 
through question and answer. If the latter be true for 
college students, how much more true must it be for 
pupils in the elementary school. 
Object Lesson.—The object lesson is a type of proce- 
dure which aims to increase experience and knowledge 
through objects and materials. The use of such a pro- 
cedure increases the interest and assists in connecting 
the outside world of facts with the teaching process. 
Nature study affords an excellent opportunity to carry 
out the use of objects and materials in the study of birds, 
flowers, and trees. Geography has many splendid illus- 
trations to offer a class when field trips are planned and 
carefully worked out. Streams, hills, stone quarries, 
sand-pits, the effects of rain and frost upon the earth’s 
surface are all interesting to a child. 
- Many lessons in arithmetic can be made much clearer
-P-A-G-E-381
CLASSROOM PROCEDURE 363 
by using concrete examples, such as working home prob- 
lems on measurement of bins, wagon-boxes, fields, and 
corn-cribs. Arithmetic lessons in banking are made 
more interesting by taking the class to the bank. The 
cashier will be glad to give them a good practical dis- 
cussion and show the boys and girls just how the bank- 
ing business is done. 
The primary store as discussed below adds to the in- 
terest of a beginning class, and is another means of using 
objects to inspire children and at the same time teach 
numbers, reading, spelling, language, and writing. The 
following is a copy of the plan used in an Iowa rural 
school: 
PRIMARY STORE 
MOTIVATING NUMBERS, READING, SPELLING, LANGUAGE, 
AND WRITING 
The members of the first grade made a collection of 
empty boxes, such as raisin, coffee, tea, rolled oats, 
cocoa, gelatine, matches, pepper, puffed wheat, and 
many others that were available about their mothers’ 
kitchens. Eggs were blown by the pupils and the empty 
shells used for eggs in the store. Prices of all products 
were learned through the home or a merchant, and the 
cost of each article printed on a small white ‘card with 
the rubber stamp printing press. This card was placed 
on the object in such a way that as the prices changed 
the card might be changed. Part of the book-case, a 
wooden box, or a table may serve as the store. Paste- 
board money can be purchased from any educational 
supply house or may be made by the children. After a 
few drills on money and making change, the class is 
ready to “keep store.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-382
  364 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
One member is chosen to be the merchant for a period 
at atime. Another member is chosen to distribute the 
money. He may be asked to count out a certain 
amount, as $2.50, $1.75, etc., for each member of the 
class. 
The names of the articles or boxes to be purchased are 
written on the board, at first by the teacher, forinstance: 
PEAHOXPORMPOMEK, UALS. iss se lacs Hbtih. «ss (s Pavey etme’ $0.25 
ABORES) OleTAISINS ef. SA at. Oe Se, ee iee is ae Rees Me 80 
The pupils are expected to read and find the sum 
mentally and immediately begin to count out money 
for the purchase. Each one is eager to do the buying, 
therefore he must take care to count out the proper 
change. 
As the class progresses, the clerk or storekeeper may 
make change for his customer and issue a bill of goods 
purchased. Fractions are worked out in simple forms, 
as: one-half dozen of eggs at fifty cents a dozen. 
This plan has obtained pleasing results in addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as in 
simple fractions. The class keeps alive and receives 
much practical value from the work. Latest market 
prices are learned and some practical experience in pur- 
chasing is gained. 
Trips to the factory or to the court-house, to the mill 
or to the machine-shop for the purpose of securing facts, 
all have a place in the modern scheme of teaching. 
The teacher must remember the following points in 
connection with the object lesson procedure: 
(1) Definite aims must be kept in mind for every field 
trip and object used. 
(2) Careful directions must be given the pupils.
-P-A-G-E-383
  
CLASSROOM PROCEDURE 365 
(3) Teacher must not expect to analyze or go too 
much into details. n 
The Inductive Lesson.—Man learns by experience. 
He sees, feels, hears, and grasps ideas about the world 
through his senses, and, after many experiences, is able 
to recognize new concepts through comparison. The 
ability to ask questions by which to connect past experi- 
ences with the future undiscovered field is the mark of 
a good teacher. Her pleasant duty is to take the hand 
of the inexperienced child and lead him by pointing out 
through questions, suggestions, and simple experiments 
the close relationship of the old known facts with the 
new and untried. Teaching becomes a pleasure when 
the pupil’s face, awry with doubt and despair, in the 
midst of questioning and searching, suddenly gleams 
with understanding and his eyes dance for joy because 
a discovery has been made. Every teacher ought to 
have a plan or aim. A plan, old but tried by many ex- 
perienced teachers, has been found so satisfactory that 
it is offered here for the assistance of prospective teach- 
ers. This plan is divided into the following parts: 
(1) The aim. 
(2) Introduction (or the preparation of the pupil’s 
mind for the new material in the advanced lesson). 
(3) Discussion (or the presentation of new points and 
a gradual cementing of old ideas with the new). 
(4) Elaboration (or the completion of the connection 
between the old and the new, by comparisons, abstrac- 
tions, and generalizations). 
(5) Conclusion and application. 
The Aim——When the assignment is made the aim 
should be included. The aim suggests to the pupil that 
something definite is to be reached, a problem is to be 
   
-P-A-G-E-384
  
366 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
solved. The statement of the aim should be simple, 
definite, short, attractive, and concrete. It should sug- 
gest new and undiscovered fields of interest. Of course 
it is plain that a teacher cannot state an aim for an ad- 
vanced lesson without herself having studied the lesson 
and carefully worked out the points that need to be 
emphasized. When the aim has been stated and the 
lesson completed, the pupils should be able to recognize 
that that aim has been accomplished. 
Preparation.—At the outset it must be said with em- 
phasis that the term Preparation as used here does not 
mean the teacher’s preparation, but rather the prepara- 
tion of the pupil’s mind for the new material. It will be 
the teacher’s duty to hold up for inspection all old, fixed 
ideas that are now in the mind of the child. Review old 
tules, principles, and data so that the pupil may gradu- 
ally begin to see the relation of the old to the new. 
During the class preparation the teacher needs to call 
into action her very best questioning ability, for more 
skill (or lack of it) may be displayed here than at any 
other point in the teaching process. i 
Presentation.—Presentation is the teaching of new 
facts or ideas to the class. It now becomes the duty of 
the teacher to select sufficient examples, illustrations, 
processes, experiments, or concrete cases, each having 
in common with the others the point to be discussed and 
comprehended, that the pupil can hardly fail to grasp 
the relationship. 
The presentation of a lesson should be clothed in sim- 
ple language. ‘The pupil needs to use all of his energy 
in the mastery of the idea at hand, and not spend time 
trying to understand difficult sentences that may be 
used in asking questions or discussing new points.
-P-A-G-E-385
  CLASSROOM PROCEDURE 367 
Hence, the teacher should previously give serious thought 
to the questions to be asked and to the direction that the 
discussion should take. 
At the close of the step of “presentation” the pupils 
should have gained a body of new knowledge that will 
assist in formulating the final conclusion. 
Elaboration—Comparison between the old and the 
new ideas and a careful weighing of all data is now the 
duty of teacher and pupil. This step displays teaching 
power or the lack of it. Now is the time to classify, ar- 
range, and locate common traits and come to decisions 
which will place new ideas into their proper relationships 
and cause such ideas to become a part of the body of 
knowledge of the learner. Contrasts of unlike features 
and clear conclusions as to where the points differ from 
each other are a necessary part of the elaboration. 
If possible pupils should be encouraged to formulate 
their own rules and principles at this time, from what 
they have discovered throughout the preparation and 
presentation. Such generalizations, comparisons, and 
abstractions cause a pupil to be ready for the final step: 
conclusion or application. 
Conclusion or Application.—The conclusion naturally 
seeks to survey the data obtained, inspect all conditions, 
and check the results against the aim that was stated 
at the beginning of the lesson. Holding up for inspec- 
tion the old ideas in comparison with the new, and 
formulating association that will hold the new matter in 
mind, are necessary at this point. Drawings, relief work, 
outlines, models, committing certain choice parts that 
make an appeal to the learner, are all a part of the appli- 
cation and conclusion. 
The following discussion of “The Lesson Plan” is
-P-A-G-E-386
    368 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
taken from Professor W. H. Bender’s book, The Teacher 
at Work. This chapter has been very helpful to hun- 
dreds of teachers in Iowa and other States, and is given 
here because the authors feel that Mr. Bender has, in 
very clear, direct language, given that which a begin- 
ning teacher needs to know about making some definite 
plan of procedure for teaching a lesson. 
The following plan, based upon Celia Thaxter’s little 
poem, “The Sandpiper,” has been worked out as a sug- 
gestion. It is based on method units and should not be 
understood as. necessarily intended for one recitation 
period. The length of recitation period, the condition 
of class, and the skill of the teacher all combine to deter- 
mine how much can be done in one period. The plan 
should be made forthe entire unit and indications given 
as to how much of this the teacher thinks he can do 
each period. Often smaller units that can be covered 
in one period may be traced through the same steps. 
When a comprehensive aim has been stated for a method 
unit requiring a number of: days for full treatment, 
there should be sub-aims given to the pupils, so that 
they may see clearly each day what is to be accom- 
plished. (In these illustrative plans, the sub-aims are 
not indicated, because recitation periods vary so much 
in length in different schools that more misunderstanding 
is probable from attempted divisions in these than there 
will be to let each stand as a unit.) 
In the “subject-matter” column there is not much 
opportunity for originality on the part of the teacher. 
The subject itself, the condition of the class, and the 
nature of the mind determine in the main what he must 
do. On the side of ‘“‘method” the teacher has abundant 
opportunity to work out original questions, illustrations,
-P-A-G-E-387
         CLASSROOM PROCEDURE 369 
and other devices that will lead the pupil’s mind sensibly 
along the way the subject and mind combined require 
that it should go. Method proper, based as it is on the 
mind and the matter, is almost a constant thing; devices 
may vary, and should do so for different classes and 
localities. It is hoped these suggestions may aid not 
only in making plans but in the higher function of exe- 
cution in the exercises of the recitation hour. They 
should be regarded as illustrations of principles and not 
as devices to be copied. 
All thoughtful teachers realize that the mind follows 
a certain order in learning. ‘Yet, to indicate in outline 
the steps in such a process as that of teaching results in 
more or less rigidity of relation of topics. These orderly 
steps glide imperceptibly into each other, but in prep- 
aration and in giving a lesson the teacher must recognize 
each in its proper place and make it as complete as pos- 
sible before leading the pupil into the advance move- 
ment. It should be remembered that there are times 
when the work in a particular step may be done very 
quickly, a few short, sharp questions being sufficient. 
There may be instances when the minds of the pupils 
seem to leap to conclusions without going through the 
processes for which the teacher had planned. On such 
occasions that part of the plan should be abandoned and 
the next division be taken up at once. It is just as 
probable, however, that the contrary conditions may 
sometimes prevail. Some steps in some lessons or with 
certain classes or subjects may take whole recitation 
periods on that one division. The teacher’s good sense 
must be the guide here, and certain steps be canvassed 
quickly or surveyed in a leisurely manner as the occa- 
sion may require. These conditions will be met all the
-P-A-G-E-388
  RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
more readily, however, by the person who plans care- 
fully. At first one learns to do a thing through con- 
sciousness of what he is doing. In the beginning the 
teacher is conscious of the steps—the pupil need not be 
so—and gradually the former acquires power to do the 
right thing unconsciously, which is the thing desired to 
be reached by this planning. 
THE SANDPIPER 
“Across the narrow beach we flit, 
One little sandpiper and I: 
And fast I gather, bit by bit, 
The scattered driftwood bleached and dry. 
The wild waves reach their hands for it, 
The wild wind raves, the tide runs high, 
As up and down the beach we flit— 
One little sandpiper and I. 
Above our heads the sullen clouds 
Scud black and swift across the sky; 
Like silent ghosts in misty shrouds 
Stand out the white lighthouses high. 
Almost as far as eye can reach 
I see the close-reefed vessels fly, 
As fast we flit along the beach— 
One little sandpiper and I. 
I watch him as he skims along 
Uttering his sweet and mournful cry; 
He starts not at my fitful song, 
Or flash of fluttering drapery. 
He has no thought of any wrong; 
He scans me with a fearless eye. 
Stanch friends are we, well tried and strong, 
The little sandpiper and I. 
Comrade, where wilt thou be to-night 
When the loosed storm breaks furiously ?

My driftwood fire will burn so bright! 
To what warm shelter canst thou fly? 
I do not fear for thee, though wroth 
The tempest rushes through the sky; 
For are we not God’s children both, 
Thou, little sandpiper, and I?”

The Appreciation Lesson.—The youth of to-day needs 
instruction in appreciation. It is easy to accept the 
world’s goods and expect that the world owes every 
individual a living. Therefore our schools need to im- 
press the youth of our land with the fact that every 
individual owes the world a life.   
-P-A-G-E-392
  374 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
Appreciation usually means the correct reaction to 
music, literature, art, beauty, and fitness; to look for 
beautiful tones, beautiful passages and couplets, to see 
the deep meaning in a wonderful painting, to dislike 
the ugly, the untidy, the unfit, and rise to higher planes. 
This is necessary, but appreciation does not stop with 
the so-called esthetic subjects; every student of our 
schools should be brought face to face: with the beauty, 
grandeur, and importance of all subjects. 
Nature study should so impress the child that he could 
not be found destroying a bird’s nest, that he could not 
pass a fine, stately tree without being impressed with its 
beauty. Mountains, streams, green fields in all their 
glory ought to appeal to the growing child. Civics must 
be taught with the thought of appreciation for homes 
and their blessings. The lives of our forefathers are the 
foundation upon which schools, churches, public conve- 
niences of all kinds have been built. No young man 
should come to maturity without regard for the sacri- 
fices of former years. Our civics and history teaching 
should inspire the youth to greater respect for law and a 
fine regard for past nation-builders. 
An illustration of the plan used by a fifth grade civics 
teacher when developing “home civics” is given below. 
Her aim was to awaken a spirit of appreciation on the 
part of the children for the many conveniences they were 
enjoying. 
The assignment was: “Find out by talking with your 
parents, or any one else, what conveniences there are 
‘around your homes, both in the house and outside, or in 
the town, that make your town a very pleasant place in 
which to live.” 
The next day the class brought in an excellent report,
-P-A-G-E-393
CLASSROOM PROCEDURE 375 
consisting of many items that indicated careful study. 
Among these were running water, paving, sewer system, 
parks, churches, and schools. 
They were led to see that all these enjoyable conve- 
niences had not come by chance, but were the result of 
labor and sacrifice on the part of citizens and neighbors 
who had paid taxes for many years to make these bless- 
ings possible. The final question that really made the 
boys and girls think and appreciate the situation was: 
“Do we as boys and girls owe anybody anything for 
these excellent conditions?’’ Hence the lesson which 
has for its aim the making and guidance of appreciation 
is important. 
Habit Formation.—Habits make life possible in this 
“hurry flurry” world. Actions, thoughts, and associa- 
tions once formed become habitual. Habit formation is 
therefore a necessary part of school work. To make 
many of the common activities of the schoolroom auto- 
matic and to increase skill in manipulation are the pur- 
poses of this procedure. Nature has so constituted the 
individual that repetition is the only means by which 
habits can be formed. The teacher of mathematics, 
English, and penmanship must not only plan to increase 
the body of knowledge in these subjects, but she must 
plan for drills, exercises, and devices that will ultimately 
fix habits of accuracy and speed in the use of all the 
common tools of knowledge. According to Thorndike 
in his Education, skill is an important matter in educa- 
tion. ; 
No one would assert that skill is the total aim, and no one 
would deny that it is a fraction of the aim, of education. The 
chief facts about it which are likely to pass unnoticed are: its 
appropriateness where the effort to give knowledge is relatively 
 
-P-A-G-E-394
    376 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
wasteful, and its service as an impersonal pleasure. Skill, as in 
the trades or household arts, can be got, even in high degree, 
by boys and girls who, by lack of capacity or interest or both, 
can get little knowledge of general principles. So, in proportion 
as schools are attended by a wider and wider selection and 
retain the unscholarly types till sixteen or eighteen instead 
of ten, twelve, or fourteen, skill becomes properly a larger and 
larger factor in their proximate aims. Skill may also be, for 
almost all individuals to some extent, and for some sorts of in- 
dividuals to a very great extent, a source of impersonal pleasure. 
The taste for workmanship—the impulse to do the job as it 
should be done—making a first-rate product by fit means—is 
one of the most éasily developed, but also one of the best, vir- 
tues. It is commonly more truly cultural or refining than an 
interest in correct manners, speech, or cpinions about the fine 
arts, because it is commonly more sincere and less tainted with 
ostentation. 
All habit formation is increased in efficiency if the 
learner knows that the habit is to be of use. This re- 
veals the fact that motivation is necessary. The teacher 
will endeavor to show the pupil through illustration and 
example that in order to write rapidly and accurately 
one must practise to write well; one needs to practise 
with certain aims of good penmanship in mind. 
The following laws taken from James’s Talks to Teach- 
ers indicate the importance of habit formation: 
(1) We must take care to launch ourselves with as 
strong and decided an initiative as possible. 
(2) Never suffer an exception to occur until the habit 
is securely rooted in your life. 
(3) Seize the very first possible opportunity to act on 
every resolution in the direction of the habits you aspire 
to gain. 
Teaching Pupils to Study.—College and high-school 
teachers frequently complain that their students do not
-P-A-G-E-395
  
CLASSROOM PROCEDURE 377 
know how to study. If this be true, then teachers ought 
to spend time in teaching children how to master them- 
selves. Study means more than mere passive reading 
of a text-book. Study the use of books and materials 
for the purpose of understanding the subject in hand. 
To study implies concentration, earnestness, zeal, and 
diligent effort. To study is to observe, to weigh, to 
analyze, and at last to arrive at some definite conclusion. 
Before boys and girls can be students and study with- 
out wasting time, they must realize why study is impor- 
tant. If the normal child can be made to see that to 
study and work out certain definite tasks is as much a 
business as building a house, keeping books, or running 
a farm he will be interested. If he can see logical steps 
of procedure and after more or less direction and advice 
can see his task ahead and its possible solution, he will 
enter into study just as naturally as any workman who 
has a plan. What can the teacher do to help train boys 
and girls to study? The following suggestions are given: 
1. By Studying with Them.—Many a child does not 
have the first idea of study. Pages are read again and 
again and nothing is accomplished. The teacher will do 
well to assign a lesson, then immediately assume the 
réle of a pupil and begin to study with them; seek the 
aim, look for what is required. What is given? What 
do we know about this now? Where must we go to find 
material on this problem? Does this material answer 
our questions? What conclusion can we form? 
2. By requiring pupils to accomplish definite ends in 
certain specified ways. 
(a) Require speed tests, such, for example, as reading 
a certain paragraph and in a certain time giving the 
thought. Give similar tests in arithmetic. 
 
-P-A-G-E-396
    378 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
(6) Answer definite questions on assignments. 
(c) Asking thought-provoking questions. 
(d) Requiring conclusions as following certain state- 
ments. 
(e) Dramatization of reading lessons. 
(f) The assignment of projects and problems for study 
and report in class. 
Each of the above suggestions should be expanded, 
but in a book of this type too much space cannot be 
given to the method of procedure. The teacher needs 
to employ all the ingenuity and teaching power that she 
possesses in order to lead boys and girls to study intelli- 
gently. 
3. By removing difficulties that prevent study. 
(a) The child gains much information before entering 
school.. He comes from a world of object lessons and he 
has learned through first-hand knowledge. Now he 
comes into a “book” world and must be helped over the 
discouragements of getting lessons from texts. 
(6) Impure air, bad light, uncomfortable seats, dis- 
order, and a teacher who talks too loud or too much, 
make it impossible for pupils to concentrate upon their 
lessons. These should be remedied if possible. 
The Project Method.—Teaching by projects is defined 
by various writers as “a large topic,” “a problem,’ or 
“whole-hearted, purposeful activity.” Generally speak- 
ing, a project indicates a more or less complex problem 
placed before a class or an individual to be solved by 
reference not only to books but also to experiences more 
or less common in the world outside of a classroom. The 
question or problem is stated and definite suggestions 
as to the means of solution are given. 
One cause for this mcthod gripping the average child   
-P-A-G-E-397
        CLASSROOM PROCEDURE 379 
is that it carries out the idea of solving a problem. 
Somewhere in the distance there is an answer, and the 
child realizes that his task is then finished—when he has 
found that answer. It suggests the idea of a race, a 
goal to be reached, a definiteness that appeals to 
him. 
Again, a tactful teacher will lead a pupil to formulate 
or suggest his own problem, and this in itself is an 
assurance of persistent effort. 
Problems and projects are not considered by all as 
having the same extent. A project generally indicates 
a greater field and a more sustained effort. Thus a 
greater length of time will be required to finish it. Prob- 
lems in any lesson make for interest. ‘‘The next lesson 
will be about Iowa” lacks the spirit and grip of: “Why 
is corn one of the greatest crops in Iowa”? ‘The teacher 
should aim to place such problems before her classes in 
all subjects. Pupils learn to think and to use judgment 
under such conditions, where only mechanical and un- 
spirited results follow the ordinary question. 
Projects may cover long periods of time, and results 
are obtained only after data have been secured and facts 
compiled. The project may mean the construction of 
charts and other articles in order to arrive at the desired 
result. The keeping of a weather chart for one month 
or the making of a flower and bird chart during the 
spring are other good examples of projects. The build- 
ing of a Holland scene showing canals and windmills and 
the cause for their existence would be an excellent sand 
table_project. 
The Assignment.—One of the most important activities 
in the classroom is the assignment of lessons. Upon this 
one procedure depends much of the success for both  
-P-A-G-E-398
380 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
teacher and pupil. If poor assignments are made, then 
poor results are quite as sure to follow. 
A good assignment is to a pupil what a good blue- 
print or building plan is to the mechanic or carpenter. 
What master carpenter would say to his workman: 
“There is the lumber, the brick, the sand, the cement; 
go build a building”? He would know better, for his 
workmen would immediately demand plans and speci- 
fications as to whether the building was to be a garage, 
a barn, or a schoolhouse, as well as other definite in- 
structions. Yet how many teachers are guilty of mak- 
ing assignments similar to the following: “Take the next 
four pages; class is excused.” 
A lesson assignment ought to prepare pupils for work 
upon the advanced lesson outside the recitation period. 
It should be so well made that the pupil can take his 
directions and go to work. Any task to be done outside 
the classroom or away from the teacher’s direction re- 
quires an assignment. ‘The assignment should include 
the following important elements: 
(1) A definite statement of the problem or the goal to 
be reached. 
(2) Suggested source of information. 
a. Library books. b. Magazines. c. Observa- 
tions. 
(3) Directions as to how to proceed, what pages in 
the reading material to omit, which points to get care- 
fully. 
(4) Suggestions that will help the pupil to see the 
relation of past experiences with the new. 
(5) Make some assignments that will require: 
(a) An individual student to report on a special 
topic.   
-P-A-G-E-399
     CLASSROOM PROCEDURE 381 
() A group of students to report on some topic 
in which they each take some part according 
to their own arrangement. 
(6) Assignments for class members ought to vary ac- 
cording to ability. 
A teacher who understands her class appreciates the 
fact that there are usually three types of pupils to be 
considered: the bright, capable pupil, who will get the 
entire assignment; the average pupil, who will do average 
work, and the dull or slow pupil, who will not be able 
to cover as much ground as either of the other two. 
The problem can only be solved by assigning enough 
work to keep each type of child working at top speed. 
This, of course, indicates more or less individual assign- 
ments. 
(Fhe-Recitation—Most of the above discussion in this 
foots involves the class period. The recitation is an 
exercise in which the pupils report upon the assignments 
made, and the teacher brings together these points to 
develop the complete idea to be left in the child’s mind. 
This is the time for the master-workman (the teacher) 
to check up on requirements. Pupils exchange ideas, 
and at the close of the recitation many dark places should 
be made light. The recitation should close with every 
pupil ready to go to his seat frling that something had 
een accomplished. \ 
i Aims of the Recitation—The aims of the recitation as 
given by Doctor W. T. Harris are: 
(1) To draw out each pupil’s view of the lesson and 
to test his grasp of the subject. 
(2) To correct the pupil’s wrong impressions and en- 
large his horizon by comparing his views with those of 
the other members of the class. 
 
-P-A-G-E-400
  382 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
(3) To arouse interest in the next lesson, stimulate 
pupils to study it, and to direct their study. 
(4) To cultivate the habit of close and continuous at- 
tention. 2 
(5) To bring out the teacher’s highest powers as an 
instructor and leader. 
(6) To supplement what the pupil gives. 
(7) To inspire self-activity, power of independent 
study, and keen insight. 
(8) To teach pupils the great advantages of helpful 
co-operation with others. 
(9) To help the pupil to overcome harmful individual 
peculiarities. 
According to the discussion of the assignment, the 
recitation may take many forms, viz.: 
The Topical Recitation —Pupils in this case may give 
the results of their investigations. They may recite 
from topical outline, or subject, thus acting as commit- 
tees and subcommittees of investigation. The class as 
a whole may be held responsible for certain large 
facts. 
The Question and Answer Recitation.—This form of 
recitation is common, but the chief difficulty here is the 
fact that teachers are sometimes poor questioners. 
“Yes” and “no” questions and memory questions con- 
stitute the chief varieties. Questions of narrow scope 
that suggest the result or that are framed in certain 
phrases of the book and suggest the proper answer are 
of no value for thought inspiration. Questions should 
possess the following characteristics if they are to secure 
results: 
(1) Be definite, direct, and pointed. If a pupil knows 
what is required and there are no involved phrases in the
-P-A-G-E-401
     
CLASSROOM PROCEDURE 383 
question he can think straight and arrive at a definite 
answer. 
(2) Must require effort. A question so formed that 
the clue to the answer is conveyed to the pupil is not a 
good type of question. Leading questions that simply 
require the assent of the pupil to a fact just stated by 
the teacher do not require any thought. Such a ques- 
tion as “Bricks are made of clay, are they not?” indi- 
cates the answer. Questions must be framed so that 
the child must put forth effort. 
(3) Must be varied. Some teachers cast every ques- 
tion in the same mould. Children soon get into the 
habit of answering such questions mechanically. Inter- 
est is lost and the recitation becomes very tiresome. 
(4) Must be well distributed over the class and over 
the subject in hand. Every pupil should feel that he is 
to be held responsible for his share of the lesson. Ques- 
tions should be directed toward the whole class, giving 
all a chance to think before any one is called upon to 
answer. 
Socialized Recitation.—Educators are maintaining that 
school should represent life itself and not merely prepare 
for life. ‘To socialize the curriculum and the schoolroom 
procedure is the demand of the present education. Pu- 
pils are not only required to know certain facts and ac- 
quire ability to reason and give attention, but they are 
also to be taught through the schools the social content 
of all these elements in the curriculum. The pupil is to 
be brought face to face with life, and in as large a degree 
as possible he is to measure subject-matter and course- 
content with “‘life’s yardstick.” Exercises of various 
kinds can be introduced into the school program that 
will bring about the socializing effect. Some of the
-P-A-G-E-402
  
384 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
most common and the easiest to introduce are men- 
tioned below. 
(1) Asking certain pupils to look up special topics and 
report to the class. 
(2) Group assignments. This involves choosing, 
selecting, and management on the part of the pupils 
themselves. Co-operation and consideration for other 
class members is the aim. Each individual has a part 
to play and unless he takes his part the class suffers loss. 
(3) Organizing the class with students as active offi- 
cers and the teacher acting as a steadying influence. 
The teacher may start the work by asking one pupil to 
open the discussion. After the pupil has finished others 
may stand and be recognized by the chairman and al- 
lowed to speak. 
(4) Literary societies, boys and girls’ organizations 
in which they are made responsible. 
(5) Bulletin board upon which clippings and pictures 
of current affairs can be posted. Questions may be 
asked by the class and answered by the one who brought 
the clipping. 
(6) A sand-table that may be used by advanced 
classes to represent scenes in foreign countries and bring 
out life situations.

        CHAPTER XX 
THE TEACHER 
In this text, thus far, much attention has been given 
to the equipment, management, and many other topics 
of importance in the organization and maintenance of 
a school. In this, the last, chapter the most important 
factor is to be given the right of way. All other trains 
of thoughts will be “sidetracked” and this “greatest of 
all” will be given the main line with “through”’ travel- 
ing orders. 
School boards, parents, county superintendents, city 
school superintendents, and some few teachers realize 
that buildings, equipment, pupils, interested parents, 
school boards, and all that one could wish will not make 
a school unless in that school there is a real teacher. 
The Teacher a Moulder of Character and Citizenship. 
—She is one of the leaders, if not the leader, of the com- 
munity, because of her training, her interests in edu- 
cation, her outlook, her good judgment, and her high 
ideals. She is an example for every child under her 
direction. If this example is good, then the children 
are being trained unconsciously for a greater citizen- 
ship. 
She takes the children at the most formative period 
of their lives. At this age it is as natural as breathing 
for the little ones to imitate, especially “their teacher,” 
who stands in their sight as the ideal. Thus they lay 
the foundation for habits while they are helpless in the 
386
-P-A-G-E-405
  THE TEACHER 387 
matter of judging what they want, or should have, in 
that future of theirs. Does the teacher realize that 
these days, seemingly unimportant, may be making for 
lifelong strength of character and joy, or for a faded, 
useless existence? Again, it may be a tragic story for 
which she would not care to share the credit. If she 
is a skilled teacher, the parents need not fear for the 
welfare of their children. They are in good hands. 
There she stands as the “parent,” guardian, adviser, 
and the only helper that these boys and girls have 
during the school day. The parents have been ever 
on the alert, watching constantly by night and by day 
every development and every peculiarity, and now, like 
a dreaded enemy, the school takes the little helpless, 
untrained human beings out of their homes to mingle 
with other children and to be given those ideals of “the 
teacher.” Do you blame that anxious mother who 
brings her little one to school on that first day, and 
hastens away as soon as possible toward her lonesome 
home, for quietly wiping away glistening tears? How 
she hopes and prays that “the teacher” is really and 
truly @ teacher, who will supplement and further the 
training that she has started. 
Teacher Trains Heart, Hand, and Establishes Ideals. 
Teaching the child to read and write is not the only 
task the teacher has to perform. This teacher is going 
to establish in his mind, through precept and example, 
certain ideals of education that will cause him to strive 
for the highest point educationally that is within his 
reach. She will lead him to form health habits that will 
follow him throughout life; such as providing fresh air, 
exercise, brushing teeth, breathing deeply, drinking 
milk, taking time to masticate food, and keeping a

clean body. She will be instrumental in helping the j 
pupil to sense his relationship to right and wrong. He 
is now placed in the midst of perplexing situations. 
The good teacher will assist him to determine the right 
in an unseen but quiet manner. Thus this little citizen 
is learning and “catching” heart training. In the mat- 
ter of industry he is discovering how to stay by a task 
‘ until it is finished. Another phase of training that will 
most certainly come in this many-sided school is the 
willingness to do the task over again if it is not up to 
standard. Thus the teacher trains not only the head 
but also the heart and the hand. 
CHARACTERISTICS OF A GoopD TEACHER 
Some one has said that the characteristics of a good 
teacher are similar to those of any good workman. 
This is true, but a teacher’s work is of such a different 
nature, and of so much more importance, that a dis- 
cussion of the outstanding points seems best. These 
characteristics have been divided into three main heads: 
training, personal qualities, physical traits. 
  I. TRAINING 
Academic.—The first essential qualification of a good 
teacher is scholarship. Certainly if State authorities 
require that their teachers reach certain standards be- 
fore accepting a position, it is a sign that the State 
places a premium on preparation. 
To know well what one attempts to teach is the ‘first 
essential qualification. Degrees and diplomas will not 
answer unless they stand for good, sound preparation. 
A preparation is demanded that places the teacher in
-P-A-G-E-407
  
THE TEACHER 389 
possession of a vastly larger amount of information 
than she can ever use before the class. She must be so 
well prepared that she can draw on a full storehouse of 
knowledge. 
Ample preparation for the task of teaching makes that 
task enjoyable because then, and only then, is the teacher 
master of the situation. She knows how to lead a child 
into subjects which to the unprepared hold no hidden 
treasures of interest. She knows so much more than 
the ordinary teacher that she virtually fills her position 
to overflowing, and the boys and girls cannot help but 
“catch” the impulse of her enthusiasm. Disorder is 
an uncommon thing in the schoolroom. The children ap- 
* parently have no time for mischief, since interest in 
the accomplishment of the work set by their energetic, 
studious teacher controls their time and directs their 
energy. 
An army cannot have confidence in its leader unless 
the individuals in that army know that their leader un- 
derstands his business. Likewise in the schoolroom, 
preparation begets confidence. Boys and girls admire 
the teacher who knows and can carry over to them, in an 
effective way, the lessons that are to be taught. 
However, it is not enough that the teacher knows 
how to work problems, knows some of the important facts 
in history, and is thoroughly grounded academically. 
She must also have a knowledge of the teaching and 
learning processes. She should know the child’s mind 
and be able to appreciate his problems. 
Professional.—As suggested above, to know subject- 
matter alone is not enough to equip a teacher for the 
teaching task. The science of teaching includes: (1) 
Psychology, which must always carry with it a study of 
   
-P-A-G-E-408
  390 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
the child’s mind, its means and methods of develop- 
ment, and a thorough study of the laws of mental 
growth. (2) Methods as a means and a guide in making 
effective the principles and laws of psychology. (3) 
School management, which seeks to adjust the teacher 
to conditions in and surrounding the school. (4) The 
observation of expert teaching and the making of lesson 
plans under a wide-awake supervisor. (5) Practice 
teaching under competent and sympathetic supervision. 
Professional Spirit——Some teachers may not be able 
financially to secure the preparation that they wish. 
This is not a crime, but if a teacher continues to teach 
with no thought of further training, especially if her 
preparation in the first place has been limited, she is ~ 
committing a crime not only against herself but against 
the profession and the children of the school. 
A teacher who will not take advantage of the many 
opportunities offered by which she may improve her- 
self while teaching is not worthy of the profession. Too 
many are satisfied with the grade of certificate now held, 
and make no effort to improve. 
When obtaining the services of professional people, 
such as lawyers and physicians, their clients and pa- 
tients seek to employ those men and women who keep 
“up” with the latest and best in their profession. No 
one wishes to employ the doctor who spends his spare 
time sitting at his desk reading cheap literature while 
the best medical magazines and “up-to-date” medical 
books receive none of his attention. Such a man never 
attends medical associations, spends no time during the 
summer months attending clinics in city hospitals, where 
expert advice could be received. No, this doctor has 
his degree and is now a “finished product.’ He does
-P-A-G-E-409
        THE TEACHER 391 
not need further training. What a calamity for his pa- 
tients. Their physician has stopped growing; in fact, 
he is dead ‘‘at the top.” 
In the teaching profession, as in every profession, there 
are many avenues open to training. The teacher who 
is really in earnest about the matter can find many 
means of growth. Some of these will be mentioned in 
succeeding paragraphs. 
Daily Growth in Teaching.—While teaching several 
classes each day for a period of nine months, the teacher 
must certainly improve as the days pass, if she is trying 
to take advantage of every means to make her work 
better. She should be a better teacher at the end of the 
term than when she began, or the ability to learn and 
profit by error and success is lacking. Teaching many 
classes and many subjects, she has a great opportunity 
to weigh methods of instruction, measure her own suc- 
cess, apply principles that have been suggested, and 
finally come to some definite decisions that will make 
for better and more determined effort the next year. 
The teacher who does not grow from year to year during 
her active teaching life is not doing herself or the profes- 
sion justice and must expect to be outdistanced by those 
who do. 
Reading Good Professional Books and Magazines.— 
Many excellent books on education dealing with every 
possible phase of the profession are now available. The 
progressive teacher will accumulate a good library in 
which these books will be found. She will not be asking 
her county superintendent if she must read an educa- 
tional book in order to receive credit toward the renewal 
of her certificate. Rather it is to be hoped that she will 
have a desire for such books. Her ruts will not become
-P-A-G-E-410
  
392 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
so deep and long. New ideas that are being tried else- 
where are given to her through these pages. Since she 
wants to keep in touch with the educational world, she 
studies and gleans from these books points which not . 
only make her a stronger teacher, but her pupils and the 
entire community are helped because of her educational 
growth. 
A teacher ought to avail herself of at least one good 
professional magazine best fitted for her particular needs, 
in order to keep in touch with current educational topics. 
Many valuable suggestions are given by other active 
workers in a similar field. The magazine is a reflector 
of the thoughts, plans, methods, and devices of the most 
progressive teachers. Many probably look upon some 
magazine articles as fads and “wild-cat” schemes—and 
no doubt many of them are; but teachers who are pro- 
gressive and on the alert for suggestions often find the 
very help they have needed in a good educational mag- 
azine. 
Educational Meetings and Teachers’ Organizations.— 
Teachers’ institutes, teachers’ study centers, State and 
district teachers’ meetings are organized and conducted 
for the benefit of teachers in service. Many avail them- 
selves of these meetings because they feel that discus- 
sions, papers, and lectures on various topics are to be 
given and they wish to secure help. The writer has dis- 
covered that the young, inexperienced girls, perhaps a 
group of the normal training girls from the local high 
school, give better attention to discussions in hand than 
some of the older teachers. This attitude is not, of 
course, characteristic of all older teachers, but when dis- 
covered it indicates that such individuals are about 
ready to receive their last monthly pay check. A 
 
-P-A-G-E-411
THE TEACHER 393 
teacher must, of all people, be progressive not only in 
name and appearance but likewise in practice. He who 
would grow must add to the grist. 
Further Training.—To hold a degree in the teaching 
profession is an excellent accomplishment. To hold all 
teachers to such high standards would be unfair perhaps. 
However, it indicates that the possessor means business 
and intends to give the best. But what can be said of 
that teacher who does not keep up his educational read- 
ing, never attends educational meetings or displays the 
least interest after he has attained his degree? He is 
like a fine-appearing tree that is dead at the heart and 
will soon be blown down. 
A teacher cannot continue for a period of years with- 
out “adding to his stature” educationally. Summer 
schools, correspondence courses of high standard, have 
been established to help those who wish to raise their 
qualifications. Nothing is more detrimental to the pro- 
fession than to have a great number of third-class teach- 
ers, who do not care to do more than the law requires, 
and who resent any suggestion concerning better prep- 
aration. Such characters do not deserve to be called 
“teachers.” 
Travel.—To-day with automobiles as a means of tour- 
ing, and with special rates on railroad and steamship, 
there is no reason why the tired teacher cannot secure 
some first-hand information for her class in geography 
or history during the summer months. Such an educa- 
tion can often be supplemented by post-cards, relics, 
and booklets that will add much to the interest in the 
classroom. Would that more teachers could secure first- 
hand information about the subject-matter with which 
they deal. This might prevent some of the absurd teach- 
 
-P-A-G-E-412
  394 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
ings of our profession. Many of the ‘‘doughboys”’ who 
were privileged to spend some time in Paris during the 
World War were often heard to remark: ‘‘Oh, yes, I 
went through the Louvre in just one hour and thirty 
minutes.’ To think that one of the greatest art galler- 
ies in the world could have been seen in one and one-half 
hours is absurd; a gallery filled with original paintings, 
the work of famous sculptors, antiques of rare value, 
enough material to keep a person busy for months if 
one had the time to spend. Of course it would be im- 
possible to prepare oneself properly to see everything in 
the Louvre unless the observer were a student of art. 
If a teacher plans a trip for the summer vacation, she 
should make a study of the territory over which she is 
to travel and determine that she will secure some first- 
hand information for her teaching work. This in itself 
is equal to or better than a summer of study. 
Understand the Age Groups of Children.—Every 
teacher must understand the age of the group of chil- 
dren with whom she is to deal. If teachers would some- 
how put themselves in the children’s places for a time, 
what results could be accomplished. Children may be 
placed in three groups: primary, intermediate, and upper 
grade. Each division represents a distinct type, and 
must be dealt with accordingly. 
Primary Years.—This group consists of little boys 
and girls who come fresh from an active play life; they 
have been playing store and school. In fact, nearly all 
of their activity has been play. They have not realized 
that they are boys and girls, they have not stopped to 
think about this yet, just little, active, wriggling, moving, 
growing animals that are absorbing much of the world 
per minute during waking hours.
-P-A-G-E-413
  THE TEACHER 395 
Happy is the teacher who is to teach primary chil- 
dren! But she must understand these little bundles of 
wriggling humanity, for if she insists on their being quiet 
every moment, if she has no place on her program for 
“wriggling,” or, in other words, change of occupation, 
she may ruin the child for life. These little folks are 
ready for suggestions. They love to do the bidding of 
the teacher. ‘Teacher’? receives apples and candy, 
but her gifts do not stop here; she is loved ‘‘to death” 
by these little admirers, and everywhere the teacher 
goes she is gréeted by smiles and praise by boys and 
girls alike. What a golden opportunity to do a large 
‘piece of work with little people. 
To be a good primary teacher means: 
(a) Love and understanding of little children. 
(0) Ability to appreciate their little problems. 
(c) Knowledge of many good games and devices that 
have in them teaching power. 
(d) Ability to lead untrained minds into new fields. 
The Intermediate Grades.—The scene has changed and 
the same little harmless chaps that such a short time 
before had been interested in calling the teacher endear- 
ing names now begin to dislike school; they begin to 
have opinions of their own, and decide that the teacher 
is not as loving and as dear to them as she once was; 
they call her the ‘“‘old crank”’ or the “old lady,” and 
assume that she is standing between them and a good 
time. 
The child at this age is very different from what he 
was in former years. He is energetic, his eyes dance 
with life, he is a veritable dynamo teeming with power 
ready to be used; but unless there is gainful employ- 
ment, nothing is accomplished. He has his strong likes 
 
-P-A-G-E-414
  396 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
and dislikes. The child develops a life of its own out- 
side the home circle and the school’s influence, and his 
natural interests are never so independent of adult in- 
fluence. He is beginning to weigh in his own mind 
many things that he heretofore has taken more or less 
for granted. He no doubt wears the worst side out, 
and the teacher only sees the one side; perchance he 
does not comb his hair, nor does he keep his shoes 
shined, and he persists in telling every one, by his ac- 
tions, how tough he is. But what of a young inex- 
perienced teacher who is placed in charge of a room 
full of giggling, foolish girls and boisterous, thoughtless 
boys. These children are at heart the best in the world, 
but on the outside they make their poor, nervous, wor- 
ried teacher feel that the struggle is not worth the effort. 
What do these boys and girls need? 
(a) A teacher who understands that boys at this age 
wear the worst side out and leave it to their teachers 
to find the boy. A teacher who understands that fool- 
ish, giggling girls do not mean what their actions seem 
to say. 
(6) A teacher who will gain the confidence of her 
pupils and try to set them right in their periods of un- 
belief and unrest, and one who is willing to go more 
than half way to assist a child in difficulty. 
(c) A teacher who is so near to life in general that 
illustrative material and activities in the schoolroom are 
so lifelike and natural that the children can easily see 
the relation between school lessons, home, and street 
problems. 
(d) A leader in the schoolroom who is full to over- 
flowing of the subjects that she is teaching; so full, in 
fact, that as she teaches these active “live wires” may 
 
-P-A-G-E-415
  
THE TEACHER 397 
be so inspired and attentive that they forget to throw 
paper wads and think of nothing but the subject in 
hand. This cannot be done by the text-book lecture 
method. It requires something alive, not the dry bones 
of past ages served on a casket lid. 
(e) A course of study must be made with the,child © 
and his needs as the central thought, and not one to 
fit the whims and desires of a few pedagogues who wish 
to try out some new fad. Again, in administering this 
course much thought and careful planning must be used 
that children’s natures and interests may be considered. 
The U pper Grade Child.—Again the scene has changed 
and these reckless, boisterous young Americans have 
come, without our realizing it, into a new stage. In 
some cases the change may be abrupt. They comb 
their hair now; the girls have stopped their foolish gig- 
gling, and the teacher in great surprise asks: ‘What has 
happened?” These children are now passing through 
the period of adolescence; the period in which ideals 
are formed. Old interests die and new instincts are 
born. This is a period of doubt, of debate and specula- 
tion. The youth is casting about for heroes. Men and 
women of noble character make their appeal to him. 
He is beginning to form habits now that will follow him 
through life. 
The adolescent child is not a serious problem in the 
country school, because the older children are not pres- 
ent, but sometimes the adolescent period appears early in 
the child’s life, and the teacher needs to be ready for 
the emergency. What the child needs at this period is: 
(a) A teacher with the highest ideals of life. 
(0) A teacher that has sympathy for the strange 
doubts and fears of youth.
-P-A-G-E-416
398 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
(c) A teacher that is a leader and capable of leading 
young people. 
(d) A teacher well qualified educationally. 
Executive Ability.—One of,the greatest needs in the 
teaching profession to-day is teachers who are willing 
' to devote some time to the business side of teaching. 
If teachers could realize that the future welfare of the 
children under their direction as well as the prosperity 
of the school depended upon the completeness and ac- 
curacy of their reports, they would consider these im- 
portant points more seriously. The promotion of the 
pupils, their classification for the next year, the needed 
supplies, and the basis for future financial support are 
all affected by the reports. She should earnestly apply 
herself to the task of keeping them up each day. If she 
will do this she will have no difficulty at the close of the 
term in making all reports for which she is respon- 
sible. 
Good Housekeeper—The writers have been in school- 
rooms that had been cleaned properly by the board be- 
fore the teacher entered for the term’s work. The evi- 
dences of poor housekeeping were noticeable as follows: 
(a) The teacher herself, for she reflected in her per- 
sonal appearance the condition of the room. 
(b) The teacher’s desk was covered with books and 
papers scattered in every direction. (A condition that 
only at times is excusable.) 
(c) Books and materials in the library and in the 
pupils’ and teachers’ desk were not in order. 
(d) Floor covered with bits of paper. 
(e) Wraps and overshoes (in season) thrown at hooks 
and racks and not placed in order. 
(f) Pictures and decorations hanging at various angles.
-P-A-G-E-417
      
   
                                                    
                                      ‘HE TEACHER 399 
(g) Dust of several days (perhaps ages) collected in 
nooks and corners. 
Many other conditions might be mentioned, bringing 
out the fact that far too many teachers are poor house- 
keepers. 
On the other hand, the writer has visited some school- 
rooms that indicated the greatest of care in all matters 
pertaining to order and neatness. The teacher reflected 
in her dress and manner the conditions of the school- 
room, that could not have been otherwise than neat and 
orderly. 
Community Mixer.—One of the greatest causes of 
failure in the teaching profession is not a lack of method 
or knowledge of subject-matter, but a lack of getting in 
touch with the neighborhood. The teacher must know 
the patrons and the taxpayers of the school and have 
the ability to use all for the upbuilding of a better school. 
This has been emphasized in the section dealing with 
the ‘‘Home” and also in the chapter on “The Com- 
munity Center.”’ In the section on the rural home we 
brought out the relation of the teacher to the homes of 
the children in her school. In the consideration of the 
community center, and likewise here, the relation of the 
teacher to the whole community is discussed. 
Visiting Homes.—As has been indicated in the dis- 
cussion on ‘The Rural Home,” the teacher must con- 
sider the community in her program of activities: She 
must know the homes, and to accomplish this she must 
make definite plans for visiting them. Such visitation 
is for the following purposes: To become acquainted 
with parents, to know their temperaments, their ideals, 
and the environment which they place around their 
children. The teacher not only needs to know these
-P-A-G-E-418
     
  400 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
conditions about the home of the children in her school, 
but to be a thorough community worker she also must 
have some knowledge of all the homes within her terri- 
tory. This knowledge need not be so complete per- 
haps for non-patron homes, but there should be at least 
some acquaintance. 
Will Stay in the Neighborhood.—Nothing is more det- 
rimental to the success of country schools and small- 
town schools than to find the workers in these institu- 
tions not interested enough in rural people to stay in 
the country part of the time. It is almost impossible 
-to communicate enthusiasm to people by mere talk. 
They enjoy seeing some action. Years ago. the. teacher 
boarded around, and in so doing learned to know the 
people, and was one of the neighborhood. The best 
teachers are the ones who live in the neighborhood and 
take their place in rural society, but to-day ave a 
new variety, known as the “dsuitcase type.” Gite: 
her suitcase packed all week, and takes it to school with 
her Friday morning, all ready for an early start home that 
evening. She usually has only a half-hour period at noon, 
so as to “get out” at three-thirty. Promptly at that 
time “some one” drives up in a fine big car, and away 
they go to the nearby town. “Some time” Sunday night 
this teacher arrives with her suitcase. Monday morn- 
ing dawns all too soon, and the school children have a 
cranky, sleepy, disinterested teacher for Monday, who 
is already living in anticipation and longing for Friday 
afternoon. This type of teacher really does not have 
the interests of the school at heart. What we need 
to-day in rural communities are teachers who will make 
an effort to live wheré.they may become a part of the 
neighborhood and in so doing gain the confidence and    
   
   
-P-A-G-E-419
  THE TEACHER 401 
co-operation of the patrons. Only by social contact 
and first-hand knowledge of the people who live in the 
district is it possible to do the best work. 
Assisting in Community Activities—In every com- 
munity there are activities of interest to the people re- 
siding in that locality. The teacher who desires to be 
of the most service will plan on doing her share. 
Of course, outside activity can be carried to extremes 
by the over-energetic individual, therefore due consid- 
eration of all that is to be done is necessary. A teacher 
should attend her own church and if possible take a 
part in some one thing, such as singing in the choir or 
possibly teaching a Sunday-school class. If she is a 
lodge member she ought to help a little, even though 
it is only to attend lodge once in a while, to show her 
interest. 
II. Prrsonat Traits 
Initiative and Originality —To be a leader requires the 
ability to initiate, to do independent thinking, to form 
plans, and to carry forward. A teacher must co-operate, 
of course, with all those with whom she works, but there 
are times when she needs to depend upon her own judg- 
ment. She cannot go to the superintendent with every 
little thing that arises. The course of study is placed in 
her hands, and she is told to ‘‘work it out.” This indi- 
cates that she is to use her own methods. Happy is the 
superintendent who knows that he has teachers on his 
faculty or in his county who have the ability and the 
originality to go ahead when something new is suggested, 
and he is quite sure that results are forthcoming. Again, 
that teacher who takes. care of most of her own difficul- 
ties in discipline is a joy to the superintendent, for no
-P-A-G-E-420
402 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
act on the part of a teacher shows her weakness so much 
as the securing of the superintendent’s help in every 
little matter that arises. 
Co-operation.—Co-operation means working together, 
acting jointly for a common end. This indicates that 
there must be at least two parties in any plan of co- 
operation. Teachers, by the very nature of their task, 
are working with other people; with the county superin- 
tendent if a rural teacher, with the city superintendent 
if a city teacher, patrons, boys and girls, and the citizens 
of the community. A co-operative spirit is, of course, 
opposed to the idea of driving ahead without considering 
“the other fellow.” However, this does not mean that 
one is to be swayed by every current of opinion that 
comes, but by a spirit of “living and let live,” of giving 
and taking, of fitting oneself into a situation that will 
make for success. 
Enthusiasm and Optimism.—Teaching requires an im- 
mense amount of enthusiasm. There is no task that 
saps the nerve force more. To keep up the spirit of the 
school the teacher must supply much of the life. A 
dead, uninterested teacher can never leave the desired 
impressions. The example of her spirit and power is an 
element of influence. A sunny, cheerful, lively spirit 
wins children’s hearts more surely than words. Cer- 
tainly such a spirit of enthusiasm makes like virtues in 
the child. This character building material is generally 
“caught rather than taught.” 
Common Sense—From White’s School Management : 
“Another element of governing ability is common sense 
—practical wisdom in dealing with the little affairs that 
make up school life. Common sense is not sense to all 
persons, but sense in common things—practical wisdom
-P-A-G-E-421
   THE TEACHER 403 
in dealing with common affairs. The adjective has 
slipped away from the noun which it qualifies.” 
Common sense, as thus defined, is an important factor 
in school discipline. It knows when to speak and when 
to keep silent, when to make request and when to com- 
mand, when to commend, how and when to put its hand 
on a child’s head, how to appease him when aggrieved, 
how to unlock the door to his heart, how to find a side 
door when the front door is bolted with anger or obsti- 
nacy, and how to come up on the right side of a dis- 
pleased patron. Common sense does not turn its ears 
in all directions to catch flattery or criticism, does not 
thrust itself into the pranks of pupils, and does not lose 
sleep over useless worries. It desires real progress and 
keeps faith and step with right and duty. 
Sincerity—Teachers who do their best in every line 
are quite sure to succeed. ‘‘To do one’s best” means 
that all the ideals and highest ambitions capable of being 
awakened are honestly made to function. To be led by 
the whim and desire of every “wind that blows,” to be 
turned aside from duty indicates insincerity. Those who 
expect to influence others must first have convictions 
themselves, then prove to the world by taking a definite 
stand that they have sincere purposes and mean to live 
up to them. To look upon the teaching profession in 
any other way is to weaken it at its very fountain head. 
Nothing is more disappointing to the youth than to find 
his ideal untrue. Teacher, be true to your convictions. 
Sympathy.—The power to scold, the ability to whip 
within an inch of the finishing point, or the reputation 
of having the shaking instinct equal to that of a cement 
and gravel mixer was at one time the qualification of a 
good teacher,
-P-A-G-E-422
404 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
To-day, patrons are looking for the person who has 
cultivated sympathy, but does not overlook discipline 
and thus spoil the child. Parents want a teacher who 
is really watching for a chance to say a word of encour- 
agement and praise, when such can be given. Children, 
like older people, have feelings with which one must 
reckon. They have periods of remorse and sadness 
peculiar only to certain types of children. Sympathy 
and the ability to see these problems with the child, and 
for the time being to tide him over this storm period, is 
a wonderful qualification. Boys and girls know when 
they have done their very best, and they need to be 
encouraged. John has been one of your most trouble- 
some boys, and at this particular time he has really 
done his best, and you now have an opportunity to go 
down to his seat and view his work. Which of the fol- 
lowing phrases do you think you ought to say to John? 
““That’s fine FoR you, John.”’ ‘“That’s FINE, John.” 
How often teachers, taking advantage of their posi- 
tion, resort to sarcasm and nagging, that they may attain 
certain desired ends. There is nothing so small and 
contemptible on the part of a teacher as the use of sar- 
casm. It displays ignorance and lack of good judgment. 
Self-control.—Self-control is a virtue often mentioned 
but seldom practised. There are, indeed, few elements 
of character more coveted and few moral defects more 
humiliating when lacking. 
A thorough mastery of self is the first requirement. 
When angry parents rage, the first impulse is to attempt 
defense through the same channels. To be able to look 
up smilingly and say “Let us talk it over” is a sample 
of self-control. 
We must not forget the fact that the parent comes in
-P-A-G-E-423
THE TEACHER 405 
a condition of “anger” and is not himself. You must 
help him to see through clear eyes and to think with a 
clear brain. For you to become angry at such a moment 
serves only to defeat your purpose. To be able to con- 
trol one’s temper is an accomplishment, but to control 
the tongue, keeping it from making cutting remarks or 
repeating information that will in any way hurt man- 
kind, is just as great. 
Self-control means: 
(a) Control of temper. 
(6) Avoidance of hasty words. ‘Think twice before 
you speak,” 
(c) Self-restraint when tempted. 
(d) Self-restraint under provocation. “Bear and for- 
bear.” 
(e) Rule your own spirit. 
“How happy is he born or taught 
Whose passions not his masters are; 
Lord of-himself, though not of lands, 
And having nothing, yet hath all.” 
—SIR HENRY WOTTON. 
Dignity.—The teaching profession demands dignity 
and self-respect. To be dignified and yet not unduly so 
is a problem that the teacher must face. Nobleness of 
bearing, seriousness of purpose, and impressiveness of 
character—together with evidence of a human spirit— 
are the marks of dignity. Self-respect, betrayed alike 
by word and deed, presupposes regard for one’s profes- 
sion. 
On the other hand, one must avoid snobbishness. 
Many well-meaning teachers have been indeed surprised 
on discovering by chance that they have been considered 
 
-P-A-G-E-424
406 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
guilty in this respect. According to Webster, a “snob” 
is one who has a mean opinion of station and material 
possessions. Let the teacher test herself. What does 
she admire? Does she have the ability to mingle with 
her patrons and not take on undesirable traits, but rather 
impress better ones upon the community? She must 
conduct herself so that those who pass can see that she 
possesses the qualities mentioned above. 
(a) Nobleness of purpose. 
(6) A serious and determined bearing. 
(c) An impressive character. : 
Tact.—Again according to Webster, tact is “a quick 
or instinctive appreciation of what is fit, proper, or right; 
a fine or ready mental discernment shown in saying or 
doing the proper thing, especially in avoiding what 
would offend or disturb.” To do or say the proper thing 
at the proper time would cover the definition. This is a 
virtue that needs cultivation. Tactfulness does not 
mean to deceive, to overlook, or to neglect duty; but it 
is to be on the alert to such an extent that one’s plan of 
attack is completed when the enemy appears. In other 
words, it is to beat the mischief maker at his own game. 
Diplomacy should keep one from needlessly arousing 
antagonism and from uselessly irritating the individual 
in question. Then the principal elements of tact are: 
(a) Keenness and sensitiveness of feeling. 
(6) Insight into the motives of others. 
(c) A knowledge of the consequences of conduct. 
(d) Quickness to see details. 
Sense of Humor.—What condition of man is more de- 
plorable than that in which the droll happenings of life 
seem to have no place. The teaching profession is filled 
with serious days, and a good, wholesome joke in which ‘
-P-A-G-E-425
         THE TEACHER 407 
all may indulge is excellent for the “liver” in more than 
one sense. Clean, sound fun ought to be encouraged in 
every schoolroom, and the teacher will do well to feature 
this side of life, perhaps in the opening exercises or in 
language work, sometimes during the year. Of course 
it is understood that such a program must be under very 
close supervision. 
Sense of Justice.—The pupils in a school have as “pu- 
pils” certain rights, and justice requires that these rights 
shall be respected, that each shall receive his due, and 
that he shall render to others that which is their due. 
- The teacher must often act in the capacity of judge in 
innumerable matters of discipline on the playground and 
in the schoolroom. She must be able to weigh very 
carefully all details and arrive at an impartial decision. 
Every child has more or less ability to judge for himself. 
The teacher should keep this fact in mind and strive to 
make decisions that will stand the test of the children’s 
questioning. 
Industry —Young teachers often fail to realize the 
great responsibility placed upon them when they begin 
their first term of school. The grade teacher in the city 
school has an experienced superintendent, who visits her 
room from time to time and checks her work. She has 
a janitor, who takes all care of her room. She is a part 
of a well-organized school system, and is directly respon- 
sible to those in authority above her. The rural teacher 
has no one to whom she is thus directly responsible for 
daily activities; she is thrown upon her own resources to 
work out her plans both within and without the school. 
Because of this she must determine within herself to hold 
to a definite standard of activity and strive to keep her- 
self up to that standard of industry and efficiency. The

teacher’s time belongs to the district, and the success of 
the school comes first. In order to accomplish, the above 
ideals the rural teacher may need to spend more time 
in her work than is actually called for in her contract. 
Character.—“ Reputation is what men and women 
think of us; character is what God and His angels know 
of us.” 
The most vital element of teaching and managing 
power is a positive moral life. Through all the channels 
of the school must run the silver thread of character, 
with its silent but far-reaching influence. After all, the 
ultimate aim of education is character. It is the one 
element of the teacher’s make-up that can touch the 
heart and conscience of the pupil with a potency more 
eloquent than words. Character looks out from the 
windows of the soul; it sits enthroned on the countenance 
as an index to the inner being. It is the sum total of 
all that has been built into one’s life. If this is true, 
the building material should be selected with care. The 
teacher must ever bear in mind that for her pupils as 
well as for herself character can never be purchased nor 
can it be ‘‘added on” hastily, since it is built day by day. 
“Think truly, and thy thoughts 
Shall the world’s famous feed: 
Speak truly, and each word of thine 
Shall be a faithful seed; 
Live truly, and thy life shall be 
A great and noble creed.” —H. BONAR.

Healih—A healthy body is the first prerequisite for 
success. A physical or mental load cannot be carried by 
the human machine unless all parts of the mechanism
-P-A-G-E-427
        THE TEACHER 409 
are in excellent working condition. Since so much de- 
pends upon the teacher, it is assumed when she accepts 
the responsibility of the school that health is one of her 
greatest assets. In most cases Providence has been kind 
in giving her a wonderful physique. Now it is her duty 
to keep this physique in repair by proper and regular 
health habits. She must have cheerful and happy ex- 
ercise, good, wholesome food, and plenty of refreshing 
sleep. 
The lack of good health means generally a nagging, 
irritable disposition. Under such conditions a teacher 
is not herself, nor does she function naturally, since she 
is working on nervous force most of the time. Children 
receive blows and onslaughts from this type of individ- 
ual and decide that teachers and schools are things to 
be avoided rather than sought. 
If one finds herself worn out at the close of the day 
and able only to drag herself home from school, it is an 
indication of low vitality and lack of endurance. She 
needs the immediate advice of a good physician. She 
owes it to herself as well as to the school. 
Energy.—Energy is the power for doing work. Power 
signifies force and strength. A teacher must possess in 
her very nature the ability to work because she wants 
to, and not because she must. She ought never to con- 
duct herself so that the community can say that she is 
not doing her best, or that she could do more if she 
would. It would be much better to have them-say: 
“That teacher is doing her best; she is always at work.” 
As has been suggested above, this matter of having 
power for each day’s task will need to come through rest, 
exercise, and proper food. Then the ability to continue 
this power, or force, throughout the day will depend 
   
-P-A-G-E-428
410 RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
upon how carefully the user conserves her strength. 
Lack of force, lack of “pep” and power, cause the down- 
fall of many an otherwise successful teacher. 
Facial Expressions—‘Do the Corners of Your Mouth 
Turn Up or Down?”’ is the title of a lecture that was 
given to the boys in our army camps during the war. 
Upon the face are written not only the present innermost 
feelings of the soul but also the thoughts and emotions 
of bygone days. 
The character of the face is determined by the character of 
the soul. The main features of our countenance were decided 
by the Almighty and we cannot change them, but under God 
we decide whether we shall have countenances benignant or 
baleful, sour or sweet, wrathful or genial, benevolent or mean, 
honest or scoundrelly, impudent or modest, courageous’ or cow- 
ardly, frank or sneaking. In all the works of God there is noth- 
ing more wonderful than the human countenance. Though the 
longest face is less then twelve inches from hair line of the fore- 
head to the bottom of the chin, and the broadest face is less 
than eight inches from cheek bone to cheek bone, yet in that 
small compass God hath wrought such differences that the six- 
teen hundred million of’the human race may be distinguished 
front each other by their facial-appearances. The face is. ordi- 
narily the index of character. It is the throne of emotions. 
It is the battlefield of the passions. It is the catalog of charac- 
ter. It is the map of the mind. It is the geography of the 
soul. And while the Lord decides before our birth whether we 
shall be handsome or homely, we are, by the character we form, 
deciding whether our countenances shall be pleasant or dis- 
agreeable. This is so much so that some of the most beautiful 
faces are unattractive because of their arrogance or their deceit- 
fulness, and some of the most rugged and irregular features are 
attractive because of the kindness that shines through them. 
Accident or sickness or scarification may veil the face so that it 
shall not express the soul, but in the majority of cases give me 
a deliberate look at a man’s countenance and I will tell you 
  ‘

whether he is a cynic or an optimist, whether he is a miser or a 
philanthropist, whether he is noble or dastardly, whether he is 
r bad. aged “—TALMAGE. 
Good Eyes and Ears.—Mr. E. E. White, in his School 
Management, gives the following: ‘Another element of 
governing ability is good eyes and good ears—the ability 
to know what pupils are doing without watching them; 
to ‘take in’ a school without espionage.” This power 
is more than the physical sense; it is the mental habit of 
seeing and hearing that which is going on in one’s pres- 
ence. In other words, it is present-mindedness as op- 
posed to absent-mindedness. 
Voice-—An expressive voice is an asset of greater 
value than is perhaps realized. Too often the teacher 
tires herself as well as the children by pitching her voice 
too high. When one is speaking with apparent effort, 
his listeners become tired and worn. On the other 
hand, the teacher, through the proper use of the voice, 
may have almost unlimited influence in the classroom. 
A loud, shrill tone of voice irritates pupils, takes their 
minds from their work, and makes discipline more 
difficult. 
Personal Appearance.—Providence has given each 
human being a body in which to place the soul. It be- 
comes the duty of each individual to live so that through 
proper use of this ‘‘temple’’ the best = 
plished in every phase of life, We are in duty bound to 
make the most of these bodies, keep them well, clean, 
neat, and free from obnoxious habits. Our personal 
appearance, which is the sum total of our dressing and 
grooming, should be such that the world will not halt 
in its onrush because of surprise or even of curiosity at

\ : our 4pBearance business man who had been a 
school man visited a neighboring town one day. He y called on the local schools, and while waiting for the 
superintendent made himself at home about the build- 
ing. He heard loud talking and, thinking trouble was 
brewing for some one, stopped before the door of a 
fourth grade teacher. Curiosity superseded interest, so 
he opened the door and entered. He found a young 
teacher talking in a loud voice, her hair unkempt and 
her general appearance very much against her chances 
of success. At the close of the recitation the gentleman 
kindly said: ‘‘May I make a suggestion?” “Yes,” was 
the reply. The gentleman then asked if she did not 
use up more energy than was necessary. The reply 
was: ‘Yes; when I’m through at night many times I 
have to go to bed.” He then said: “Do you need to 
comb your hair in that fashion?” Her answer was: 
“No.” This business man again said: “I’m many 
years your senior, and let me suggest some things to 
you. You could teach in my school if you would do 
three things—comb your hair properly, dress yourself 
more fittingly, and lower your voice in the schoolroom.” 
This is an example of a teacher who nullified her good 
points in her failure to weigh the influence of personal 
appearance. 
Checking Efficiency—The following is a system of 
checking the efficiency and ability of teachers. This 
becomes very valuable when students are taken out to 
inspect a rural school. The points listed need to be 
studied so that teachers may see what points are con- 
sidered when discussing an efficient teacher. Most 
superintendents of city and town school systems use 
blanks quite similar to this in collecting information

QUESTIONS 
. What is your opinion of the statement ‘Teachers are born, 
not made” ? 
- Do you have in mind any one teacher who has been your 
ideal? If so, what were the characteristics of that 
teacher ? 
. As you recall your former teachers and their schools, do you 
see now why some were successful and why some failed ? 
Analyze the difference. 
. Have you ever known teachers to fail because of personal 
appearance and conduct in public? Give a full account. 
. In this chapter many characteristics of the teacher have been 
discussed. List them in order of their importance as 
you see the teaching profession. 
. What are some of the characteristics of a profession? Do 
you consider that teaching is a profession? Why? 
. School boards are usually expected to keep their contracts. 
What should be expected of the teacher in this respect ? 
. Ought teachers to organize themselves into a union and de- 
mand higher wages? Give argument either way. 
. School boards sometimes hire the teacher who offers to teach 
the cheapest. Ought teachers to underbid each other ? 
Why ? 
School boards and patrons often demand better morals and 
a higher standard of character in teachers than they 
possess themselves. What do you think of this? 
Why does the public seem to be so overcome with mingled 
surprise and disgust when it discovers that a teacher in 
its schools has made some moral mistake? 
A teacher began keeping company with young men of the 
town as soon as she arrived for her fall term of school. 
What do you think about it? Discuss this quite fully. 
Suppose the school board asks a teacher not to dance or 
attend card parties. What would you do if you were 
that teacher? 
Suppose your school board wants to have a two weeks’ corn- 
husking vacation in the fall. What would you do about 
it?

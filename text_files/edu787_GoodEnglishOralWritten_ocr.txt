INTRODUCTION: 
Good English, Book Two, covers two years’ work and 
is in a unique way welded with Book One of the Series, 
: building solidly on the foundation laid in the 
Welding . : : : 
the Series earlier years. _ This desirable end is accom- 
plished by adding a complete summary (pages 
311-317) of the language facts taught in Book One, and 
by giving frequent references to it in the early chapters 
(see page 3). By this means the work of Book One is 
reviewed in close articulation with the work of Book Two. 
This plan is of special value in strengthening the founda- 
tion of language facts taught in Book One which are to 
be carried a step farther in the next grades. 
The book is divided into approximately one hundred 
sixty carefully planned lessons ‘for each year’s work. These 
lessons are grouped into chapters, each com- 
posed of a series of related units that center 
about a common theme, providing work for 
a period equivalent in general to a school month. The les- 
sons for each chapter, therefore, are not haphazard and 
miscellaneous but are woven together into a purposeful 
whole, closing with a complete review of all the languaye 
facts treated in the chapter. 
The material on which conversation and written exer- 
cises are based has been selected with reference to its living 
interest to children and its vital relation 
to their experiences. The lessons are so 
arranged that oral discussion precedes and 
prepares for written expression. The wealth of ideas con- 
tributed by the various members of the class in oral discus-

sion is thus placed at the service of the individual pupil in 
the written exercise that follows. Similarly in the mechan- 
ics of expression, the difficulties of the written composition 
are anticipated in the oral lesson. In this way the text 
recognizes the superior value of oral speech, not only as a 
preparation for written expression, but also as a means of 
enlarging vocabulary and giving power in the use of language. 
Technical facts, such as develop an understanding of the 
various uses and the parts of the sentence, and of the more 
important classes of words, are introduced as 
needed, but great care has been taken to avoid 
burdening pupils with unnecessary intricacies 
that promise little or nothing for greater power of expression. 
The grammatical terms used conform with the report 
(adopted in 1913) of the Joint Committee on Grammatical 
Nomenclature, appointed by the National Education Asso- 
ciation, the Modern Language Association of America, and 
the American Philological Association. 
Great emphasis is placed upon correct usage, especially 
of such commonly misused words as see, do, come, and go. 
The words treated have not been selected hap- 
hazard on mere personal opinion, but on the basis 
of recent scientific studies showing the blunders 
made most frequently by children in oral and written expres- 
sion, notably the investigations made in Kansas City by the 
University of Missouri, the investigation made by the Uni- 
versity of Wisconsin, and other similar studies. 
The authors believe that only through systematic repeti- 
tion of language facts and of correct forms can accurate 
habits of expression be established. To accom- 
plish this end, each language fact and correct, 
form taught is put before the pupil again and 
again with varied associations in subsequent lessons (see 
Index). This recurrent treatment, reénforced by the reviews Technical

INTRODUCTION v 
at the ends of chapters and the half-yearly and yearly sum- 
maries, provides a basis of thoroughness that it is believed will 
secure for pupils a real mastery of the fundamental lan- 
guage principles. 
No feature of this text has been worked out with greater 
care than the illustrations. They are not mere decorations, 
but in all cases serve a distinct purpose in 
IWustrations language instruction. The pictures are unus- 
ually rich in the suggestion of ideas for dis- 
cussion and in the stimulation of the imagination. Especially 
happy as a basis for conversation are the interesting sketches 
by Mr. C. A. Briggs, the widely known cartoonist. The 
conspicuous place of the cartoon in present-day illustration, 
particularly in delineating humor, led the authors to include 
these exceptional examples of this form of graphic art. 
In the preparation of this series, the authors have kept 
constantly in mind the fact that the function of any school 
Special book is to serve as a tool for classroom use. 
Features Attention is called to the following features 
of the text— many of them unique — which 
ensure the maximum working efficiency in service when 
applied to the problems of the schoolroom: 
(1) A comprehensive glossary, pages 333-348, contains 
the words and phrases of the text that offer valuable 
vocabulary training either of pronunciation or meaning. 
The aim is to leave the teacher free to use the glossary 
according to the needs of her particular class, but sug- 
gestive type exercises in word study based on this 
glossary are given from time to time in the text, as on 
pages 4, 17, ete. 
(2) The language facts taught throughout the book 
are thoroughly organized for purpose of review by means 
of systematic reviews at ends of chapters (see page 23), 
half-yearly summaries (see page 88), a yearly summary
-P-A-G-E-7
vi INTRODUCTION 
(gee page 152), and a complete summary of the book 
(pages 305-310). In addition to these, a complete 
summary of the definitions and rules taught in Book 
One (see pages 311-317) articulates the language facts 
already learned with those taught in Book Two, as 
previously mentioned. 
(3) The work for each year has been divided into 
approximately 160 lessons, providing convenient units 
for daily assignment. 
(4) Suggestive testing forms for the pupil’s use in 
checking up his written work (see pages 167, 168) have 
been provided, with a view to secure for the student a 
sense of personal responsibility. 
(5) Group exercises, in the form of class composi- 
tions, are included from time to time (see pages 237, 
270, etc.) designed to train the pupil in actual methods 
of workmanship in composition. 
(6) Special lessons on dramatization, dictation, and 
the memorizing of short literary selections, furnish 
variety and broaden the scope of the work. 
(7) A detailed table of contents, showing the topics 
treated in each lesson, and a complete index for use in 
locating every important fact treated add to the service- 
ability of the book. 
(8) In an Appendix (pages 318-332) is furnished a 
list of subjects for oral and written composition, which 
may be used at the teacher’s discretion to supplement 
the lessons in the text or to take the place of certain 
lessons in the book. ; 
(9) A Teachers’ Manual is provided, giving detailed 
suggestions for each lesson.

The goldenrod is yellow; 
The corn is turning brown; 
The trees in apple orchards 
With fruit are bending down. ) 
The gentian’s bluest fringes 
Are curling in the sun; 
In dusky pods the milkweed 
Tts hidden silk has spun. 
The sedges flaunt their harvest 
In every meadow-nook; 
And asters by the brookside 
Make asters in the brook. 
From dewy lanes at morning 
The grapes’ sweet odors rise; 
At noon the roads all flutter 
With yellow butterflies. 
By all these lovely tokens 
September days are here, 
With summer’s best of weather, 
And autumn’s best of cheer. 
— Helen Hunt Jackson.

Lesson 4— Lzarnine Worps: THE GLossary 
1. Words and Groups of Words. 
To increase the number of words that you can use 
correctly in your daily speech and writing is an important 
part of your language work. The greater the number of 
words you know, the more interesting to others your 
conversation and writing will be. 
In any poem or story there may be some words you 
do not know how to pronounce correctly, such as gentian 
and flaunt. There may be others you do not understand, 
such as tokens and sedges. ‘To help you in the study of 
such words, a Glossary is provided, beginning on page 
334. Wherever in this book you find a word the pro- 
nunciation or meaning of which you do not know, look 
it up in the Glossary or the dictionary. 
Study the pronunciation and meaning of the following 
words and groups of words found in Lesson 2: 
gentian tokens flaunt 
literature apostrophe sedges 
make asters in the brook 
autumn’s best of cheer 
2. Written Exercise. 
Write sentences containing the above words and groups 
of words. 
Lesson 5 — Literature 
1. Reading. 
u PRosERPINA 
Ceres was the goddess of the harvest. She was busy from 
morning until night taking care of the crops. Her little 
daughter, Proserpina, was left all alone during the day to amuse 
herself as best she could.
-P-A-G-E-22
PART ONE 5 
One bright sunny summer day while Ceres was making the 
corn grow in a far distant country, Proserpina strayed into 
the fields to gather flowers. The farther she went from home 
the more beautiful the flowers seemed. At length she saw a 
flower that was more beautiful than any that she had ever 
seen. Just as she was about to pluck it, King Pluto, who 
ruled over the underworld, came along and carried her off to 
his palace. 
When Ceres came home and found Proserpina missing, she 
set out at once to look for her.. She searched day after day and 
night after night, but could find no trace of her daughter. 
At last Apollo, the sun god, sent word that he had seen King 
Pluto carry her off. Then Ceres said that nothing. should ever 
grow again until Proserpina came back. At her command, the 
flowers stopped blooming, the grains and grass stopped growing, 
and the trees lost their leaves. 
Finally Jupiter, who was king of all the gods, sent his messenger, 
Mercury, to ask Pluto to return Proserpina. When Pluto heard 
how Ceres grieved for her daughter he consented, although he 
said that he should be very lonely without her. 
Ceres eagerly watched for her daughter, and when she | saw her 
coming ran joyfully to meet her. Then the grass and grain began 
to sprout, the flowers began to blossom, and the trees began to 
grow their leaves. 
“Did you eat anything while you were in the underworld?” 
asked Ceres. 
“T tasted no food until this very morning, when I bit into 
a pomegranate,’ answered Proserpina. “I did not swallow 
any of the fruit, but six of the seeds remained in my mouth.” 
“Then you will be allowed to stay with me only part of the 
time,” Ceres answered sorrowfully; “you will have to stay six 
months of every year with King Pluto.” 
While Proserpina lives with her mother we have spring, 
summer, and harvest, but during the six months that she stays 
in the underworld with King Pluto the earth sleeps, awaiting 
her return. :

JOHN GORRIE 
Several years ago Congress invited each state in the Union 
to send to Washington the statues of the two men who had been 
most distinguished in the life of the state. A corridor in the 
House of Representatives was set aside for these statues, and is 
known as Statuary Hall. . 
In 1914 Florida placed in this hall a statue of Doctor John 
Gorrie. Few people knew who Doctor Gorrie was, and mghy 
wondered why he had been given such a great honor, although 
everybody in our eountry enjoys the comforts and blessings of 
what he did. As the inventor of the process of manufacturing 
ice, Doetor Gorrie made a great gift to the world, and especially 
to his native South, with its warm, climate. 
John Gorrie was born in Charlestown, South Carolina, 
October 3, 1808. After graduating in medicine at New York, in 
1825, he settled as a doctor in Apalachicala, Florida, at that time 
one of the principal cotton ports on the Gulf of Mexico. 
Besides practicmg medicine, he served as treasurer and mayor 
of Apalachicola, and was for many years a member of the city 
council, ™ 
His sympathy for the sick was unmeasured, and he worked 
untiringly to help them. He gave his greatest efforts to finding 
_ a way to cool the rooms of his many fever patients; and in this 
he succeeded so well that he became absorbed ‘in the idea of 
manufacturing ice. At this time there was no ice except what was 
taken in cold climates from the lakes and streams in the winter. 
It was almost impossible to get this to warm climates for 
summer use. : 
In 1851 Doetor Gorrie patented the process of making artificial 
ice. This was the foundation of the big industry of ice-making 
and cold storage of today. Doctor Gorrie never received any

1. Writing a Letter. 
Think of the letter you would write if you wished te 
invite a friend to spend Saturday afternoon with you. 
You should do more than merely ask your friend to come. 
You should tell him at what hour you wish him to come, 
how you expect to spend the afternoon, and how long you 
wish him to stay. You should also tell your friend who 
‘gave you permission to invite him.

‘Dear Pred: May 26, 1917 
Can you come and spend next Saturday afternoon 
with us? Mother says she will be glad to have you 
come if your mother is willing. We are going to have 
@ circus in our barn, and you may be one of. the 
acrobats, The real fun will begin at two o'clock but 
we want you to come at one, if you can. Tell your 
mother you will be home at six.

What is the heading of a letter? See (d) on page 315. 
The heading is usually arranged on three lines if a street 
number is given; otherwise, on two lines. 
Some writers place punctuation marks at the ends of 
lines in the heading, but such marks are not necessary 
except after abbreviations. 
What is the salutation of a letter?. See (d) on page 315. 
The body. of a letter contains the main thought of 
the letter. 
What is the complimentary close of a letter? The 
signature? See (d) on page 315. 
The titles Mr., Mrs., and Miss are not names and should 
not form part of the signature. George’s father signs 
his name Charles R. Williams. George’s mother signs her 
name Jessie M. Williams. If she is writing a business 
letter, she writes below her signature, and a little to the 
left, the name by which she wishes to be addressed. She 
encloses it in parentheses, as follows: 
(Mrs. Charles R. Williams).

  The names of the city and the state may be written 
in one line, with a comma between them, instead of in 
two lines as illustrated. The name of the state is fre- 
quently abbreviated. 
3. Written Exercise. 
Write a letter inviting a friend to spend next Saturday 
afternoon with you. Then cut a piece of paper the size

GoLpENRop’s Dream 
Fast asleep lay little Goldenrod in the big meadow, for it 
was summer time and a very drowsy kind of weather. Her 
bright yellow dress was packed away carefully for the cold 
autumn days and she now wore a plain summer dress of green.

She dreamed that she was being carried out to sea on the top of 
ahigh wave. After carrying her far out where she could see nothing 
but water, the wave ship landed her one bright day in a strange 
country on the other side of the ocean. 
“Now,” said Goldenrod to herself, “I can see the world”; 
and she started off on her travels. After visiting a number of 
places and seeing a great many strange things, she found herself 
one morning in a large room hung with beautiful banners of silk 
and satin—~blue, red, yellow, and other lovely colors. Each 
banner was embroidered with a different kind of flower, so daintily 
worked that Goldenrod thought the midsummer fairies must 
have picked the blossoms and placed them there with their own 
tiny fingers. They looked so very real she was tempted to touch 
them. As she watched them with wonder she suddenly heard 
a great rustling of the silk, and then all of the flowets stepped 
out of their places on the banners and arranged themselves in 
a large bouquet on the table. 
One of them, a beautiful rose, was the first to speak. “TI,” 
she said, introducing herself, “am the Rose of England. We 
are all flowers of great nations, and people paint our pictures 
on beautiful banners because they love us dearly. When a new 
flower visits us from a strange country, we are allowed to step 
out to bid her welcome. 
“Kings and queens have loved me for hundreds of years,” 
continued the beautiful Rose, drawing herself up proudly; “and 
once, very long ago, when there was a great war in England, the 
people called it the ‘War of the Roses,’ because the prince who 
wore a white rose was angry with the prince who wore a red rose.”” 
“How nice, to be loved by many great people!” thought 
Goldenrod. Then, as she looked at the next speaker, she won- 
dered why anyone should love such a plain little green leaf, 
which looked very much like the common clover growing wild 
in the meadow at home. The little leaf introduced herself 
by saying, “I am the Shamrock of Ireland—only a simple 
green leaf with three small leaHéts! as you see; but all the people, 
even the little children, love me so well that I would not change 
places even with the Rose. They say that a great saint first
-P-A-G-E-33
16 - GOOD ENGLISH ' 
showed me to the people of Ireland, and that they have loved me 
ever since.” When Goldenrod heard the sweet voice, so full 
of brightness, she no longer wondered why people loved the little 
green leaf. ° 
“My name is Thistle,” said a tall, prickly flower on the 
other side of the Shamrock. “If you touch me you will feel 
my long needles, which many, many years ago helped the people 
of Scotland to win a great battle. This is one reason they love 
me, and like to see tne growing all over their dear land.” 
“t,” said a beautiful flower very unlike the Thistle, “am 
the Fleur-de'lis of fair France. Great kings havé worn me on 
their rabes and painted me on their banners for hundreds of years.’’ 
“How brave and great these flowers must be!” thought 
Goldenrod, as the beautiful Fleur-delis stepped back into her 
place;‘then she looked at the sweet~blue blossom that seemed. 
about to speak, and wondered what her name might be. 
“T am the Cornflower of Germany,” said the simple blue 
flower. “I grow all over the fields and meadows, and the little 
children make me into wreaths to crown: theit bright heads. I 
hold the color of the skies, and you of the sunshine; so we need 
not wonder if the children love us. Perhaps some day you, too, 
may be given a plave on a beautiful banner. Love all, bloom for 
all, and you will be loved by all.” 
When the Cornflower had finished speaking, each flower left 
the beautiful bouquet and returned to her own banner. 
Goldenrod rubbed her eyes in astonishment to find out 
whether or not she was dreaming; and. when she opened them 
again, she saw only the wide meadow where she had fallen 
asleep in the sunshine. The days were no longer warm, and 
the cool breeze rocking the trees overhead sounded like the 
rustling of the silk banners that had roused her from her dream. 
Then she thought of what the sweet Cornflower had said, “Love 
all, bloom for all”; so she put aside her plain dress of green and 
shook out her bright yellow gown, that all of her family might 
see it was time for them to “bloom for all” in their own great 
land — America, :

Tae LEGEND or THE Two GENTIANS 
The Closed Gentian never opens. The Fringed Gentian 
closes in the afternoon. There is a little story that accounts 
for the difference between these two flowers. 
Once the Queen of the Fairies was out late at night. The 
midnight hour had passed and the silver moon had swung down 
and out of sight. Hurrying to a Gentian, the Fairy asked for 
shelter. 
“Who are you, and why do you come to disturb me at this 
hour of night?” called the sleepy Gentian. 
“T am the Queen of the Fairies,” cried the little lady. 
“Very well, then, if you are the Queen of the Fairies you 
can find places enough to sleep. Go away and let me sleep.’” 
Poor little Fairy Queen! She was afraid to be without shelter, 
out in the big dark world. 
“Y will try again,” said she. And going up to another 
Gentian not far away, she timidly asked, “Can you sive shelter 
to a tired wayfarer, good flower?” 
Out peeped the Gentian. “Poor little lady!” said the flower. 
“Whoever you are, you are too little to be out in the dark. 
Come in and let me cover you over till the sun comes.” 
Then the little Fairy slept soundly until morning began to 
dawn. As she hastened away in the dim light, she said, turning 
to the flower that had protected her, ‘Kind friend, you and all 
your children shall hereafter be distinguished from all other 
Gentians by the power which I now ‘give you to open your 
fringed eyes to receive the warm light of the sun when first he 
‘peeps upon the world; but your selfish sisters shall remain 
closed forever.”

“Perhaps the great Tree will forget, 
And let us stay until the spring, 
If we all beg and coax and fret.” 
But the great Tree did no such thing; 
He smiled to hear their whispering. 
“Come, children, all to bed,” he cried; 
And ere the leaves could urge their prayer, 
He shook his head, and far and wide, 
Fluttering and rustling everywhere, 
Down sped the leaflets through the air. 
I saw them; on the ground they lay, 
Golden and red, a huddled swarm, 
Waiting till one from far away, 
White bedclothes heaped upon her arm, 
Should come to wrap them safe and warm. 
The great bare Tree looked down and smiled. 
“Good night, dear little leaves,” he said. 
And from below each sleepy child 
Replied, “Good night,” and murmured, 
“Tt is so nice to go to bed!”

CaRisrorHER CoLUMBUS 
Christopher Columbus was born near Genoa, Italy, in -1446. 
As a child he spent much time at the wharves or on the seashore, 
watching the ships as they came and went. In school he was 
interested in geography, astronomy, and map drawing. He became 
a sailor when he was fourf®n, and his ambition was to be a 
captain and command a, vessel of his own. 
At that time the most beautiful silks and shawls, and the 
costliest pearls, perfumes, and spices came from India. The trade 
route, however, was long and full of disks. Columbus was one 
of the few who believed that a shorter route could be discovered, 
for he believed the world to be round. He thought that by sailing 
directly west he would come to India. 
He was eager to prove that his theory was correct. To do 
this, however, he needed boats, money, and men. He went to 
the different courts of' Europe asking for help, but was refused, 
Finally, with the assistance of Queen Isabella of Spain, he fitted 
out three small vesve! s,/ the Sania Maria, the Pinia, and the 
Nina. 
On August 3, 1492, Columbus and one hundred ay 
men set sail from Palos, Spain, into the Sea of Darkn 
the Atlantic Ocean was then called. They sailed for weeks 
with nothing in sight but water. ~ The men became frightened and™ 
threatened ‘to mutiny. A! last Columbus promised that if 
they did not sight land within three days, they would turn 
back. Two days later, on the twelfth. of October, they landed™ 
on a beautiful island covered with tall trees and bright flow- 
ers. ‘The men were so happy that. they knelt down and kissed 
the ground; then they offered a thanksgiving prayer to God 
for their safe voyage. 
We now know that Columbus and his” men landed on one of - 
the islands of the West Indies. Columbus believed that this 
land was a part of India; so she called the people whom he 
found living there “Indians.” — He :

THE Fox aNp THE Crow 
Once a fox saw a crow fly off with a piece of cheese and 
light on the branch of a tree. 
“T must get that piece of cheese,’ said Master Reynard. So 
he walked up to the foot of the tree. 
“Good day, Mistress Crow,” cried Reynard. “How well 
you are looking today! How glossy your feathers! How bright 
your eye! Good Mistress Crow, I have heard that your voice 
is as fine as your figure is fair. Pray let me hear your: notes 
that I may greet you as the Queen of Song.” . 
The crow, pleased with the soft words of the cunning fox, 
began to caw her best. The moment she opened her mouth, 
the cheese fell to the ground, where it was snapped up by the 
fox. 
“Thank you, Mistress Crow,” said he. “TI like your cheese 
even better than your song.”

been very lonely, shut in, as it was, in a world of silence an

When Helen was about seven years old, Miss Anne Sulliva:

Sullivan gave Helen a doll, which she played with for some time 
Then Miss Sullivan took her hand and spelled the word “doll‘ 
in it. Helen thought this was a new game and tried to imitat 
“Mer. Miss Sullivan taught her td make many other words, bu. 
they had no meaning for-her. One day they went to the well 
house, where someone was drawing water. Miss Sullivan placed 
one of Helen’s hands under the spout while she spelled the word 
“water” over and over again in the other. All at once Helen under- 
stood and before evening came she had mastered several other 
words. 
After she had learned to talk by means of the sign language, 
Miss Sullivan taught her to read. The young girl was given 
slips of cardboard with words stamped in raised letters and a 
frame in which she could arrange these words into sentences. 
She spent hours finding words that stood for different objects 
in the room, and inventing sentence’ of her own about them. 
From this exercise it was easy for her *® learn to read books with 
. Taised print. 
By touching the throats and lips of ter friends, Helen learned 
how to speak single words. She found, it difficult at first to 
modulate her voice, but after months of hard work she finally 
gained the ability to speak long sentences that others could 
readily understand. 
When she was nineteen years old, Miss‘ Keller entered Rad- 
cliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts. No one like her 
had ever done such a thing before, and at fitst it seemed impos-

sible to carry on the work. The books she needed had never 
been printed in raised type, but some wealthy people who were 
interested in her had the books made. During lectures someone 
sat beside her and talked the sentences into her hand. She 
learned to write out her lessons on a typewriter. The work at 
college was very much harder for her than for her classmates, 
but she persevered until she graduated. 
Since she left college, Helen Keller has been busy helping

Litrte Rep Prive 
There was once an Indian warrior chief whom everybody loved. 
He loved his people and longed always to bring happiness to 
them. The good spirits, or “manitos,” as the Indians called 
them, loved him and gave him many y onderful gifts. 
One morning, very early, as he was wandering through a forest, 
a voice at his feet called out, “Good~morning!” 
The chief looked down, but could hardly see who was there. 
“Who are you?” he said. 
“T am Mondamin, or Little Red Plume,” said a little man, 
and he shook his red-plumed head at the big chief. 
“You are strong, chief,” the little man said. “Tell me what 
makes you so strong.” . 
“T am strong only as all men are strong,” said the chief. 
“Very well, then, let us wrestle. If you throw me, cry, 
‘Wagenewa! Wagenewa!? and if I throw you, I will ery, ‘Wage- 
newa! Fagenewah” 
All day long they wrestled, for Little Red Plume had magic 
strength; but when the sun began to fall, the big chief cried, 
“Wagenewa! Wagenewa!” for at last Red Plume lay at his feet. 
The chief stooped to pick up his tiny foe, but lo! there was 
no foe there. Only an.ear of. red corn was to be seen. Indeed, 
the chief would have thought the manitos had carried Mi ~ 
away, if he had not seen attached to the corn the same 
red plume that had been on the head of the little 
Then a voice that seemed to come from the ear of co: 
to him: “Again, good chief, you shall carry a great gift w your 
people; for I am Mondamin, the friend of the red children. Be: 
you have conquered me, you shall take me to them. But 
strip off the coat that protects me from the stormé‘and the wu. 
Take my kernels and scatter them in the rich soil by.the river side. 
After you have done that, go away, and do not come back till 
several moons have passed. Then I will give you for your people 
the gift of corn.”
-P-A-G-E-72
PART ONE 65 
The chief did as he was told, and when he came back he saw 
a whole field of tall waving corn; on each plant was a waving plume, 
and hid away among the thick leaves was a husk of corn. 
“Té is Mondamin!” the chief said. 
Then Mondamin spoke again: “This is the gift of corn 
that I promised. Now call your people, gather all the Red 
‘lumes, grind the kernels between great rocks, and you shall 
ve a food that will never fail. Some of the kernels you shall 
plant, again; then another field of corn will rise up and you 
shall gather it and hide it away for the winter’s food.” 
The chief called the people. They gathered the Red Plumes 
and fed the tall plants to the cattle. They held a great feast, and 
danced and sang songs to Mondamin, for they knew now that he 
was their friend.

Plum stones, bowl, and counters: Five plum stones, a basket 
or a wooden bowl, and one hundred counters will be needed for 
the game. The Omaha Indians used stalks of the blue joint 
grass as counters, but small twigs or sticks may be used’ 
The plum stones should be carefully cleaned and dried. Two 
of the stones are burned black on both sides with a hot iron; 
on one side of each of these stones a crescent is marked;-and the 
black in the center of the crescent is scraped off to leave a clear 
design of a new moon with a background of black. On the other 
side of these two stones, a star, four or five pointed, is drawn, 
and all the black in the center is scraped off, leaving a brown star 
with a background of black. Each of the other three stones is 
‘burned black on one side; the other side is left the natural color.

sponding number of counters from the common pile and lays 
them beside him, on the side opposite the common pile. When 
all the counters in the common pile have been taken, the winner 
takes *his counters from the winnings of his opponent. Who- 
ever gains all the one’ hundred points wins the game. 
Lots are drawn to decide who shall have the ‘first play. The 
one who wins takes the bowl or the basket by the rim with both 
hands and gives it a toss sufficient to throw up all the stones, 
but not violent enough to make them fall outside the bowl or 
basket; such a throw would not count. If the throw is not 
such as will move all the stones, and make them turn and: 
move about within the bowl, that throw will not count. 
The points scored depend upon the sides of the stones turned 
up by each throw. The following combinations are the only ones 
that make points: 
Two crescents and three natural color = 10 points. 
Two stars and three blacks = 10 points. 
One crescent, one star, and three blacks = 1 point. 
No other combinations of stones count anything in the game; 
as will be seen, there. are a number that cannot be counted. If 
one player tosses the bowl and the stones fall in such a manner 
as to make a combination that does not count, there is no forfeit; 
the player merely fails to score any points. The player who wins 
a point or points continues to toss the bowl as long as he ean 
win a point. Among the Indian women there are. players so 
skillful as to make the stones fall frequently in combinations 
that win ten points.

CHRISTMAS IN THE OLDEN Timm 
On Christmas eve the bells were rung; 
The damsel donned her kirtle sheen; 
The hall was dressed with holly green; 
Forth to the wood did merry men go, 
To gather in the mistletoe. 
Then opened wide the baron’s hall 
To vassal, tenant, serf, and all; 
Power laid his rod of rule aside, 
And Ceremony doffed his pride. 
The fire, with well-dried logs supplied, 
Went roaring up the chimney wide; 
The huge hall table’s oaken face, 
Serubbed till it shone, the day to grace, 
Bore then upon its massive board 
No mark to part the squire and lord. 
There the huge sirloin reeked; hard by 
Plum porridge stood, and Christmas pie; 
Nor failed old Scotland to produce, 
At such high tide, her savory goose. 
Then came the merry maskers in, 
And carols roared with blithesome din; 
If unmelodious was the song, 
It was a hearty note, and strong.

Toe Maponna or THE Cuair 
Father Bernardo was a good, wise hermit who lived in a 
little hut among the hills of Italy. He was very fond of Mary, 
the vinedresser’s daughter, who visited him and cheered him with 
her kind words and pleasant smiles. The good man was also 
very fond of an old oak tree that grew beside his hut; he called 
the tree his “dumb daughter” and talked to it as though it could 
understand him. 
One spring the melting snow and heavy rains washed 1 away 
his hut and his garden. He took refuge in the old oak. When 
the storm was over, Mary came to see him. He had been 
without food for several days and was ill from the effects of eold 
and rain. Mary took him to her home and eared for him until 
his hut was rebuilt. After that Father Bernardo prayed that 
Mary and the oak might be forever blessed and that some unusual 
good fortune might befall them for what they had done for him. 
For many years the hermit lived in his hillside hut. After 
his death the old oak tree was made into casks for Mary’s father. 
One day as Mary sat in the arbor playing with her two 
children, the great artist, Raphael, happened to see them, and 
immediately wanted to paint a picture of them. He drew the 
outline for the picture on the head of a cask that stood near, and 
from that outline he painted the great picture called “The Madonna 
of the Chair,” shown on page 64. In this way the hermit’s prayer 
was answered, and Mary and the oak will be honored for all time.

"TIMEPIECES 
Centuries ago people paid little attention to the measure- 
ment of time. They needed to know only the two period: 
— day and night. 
Time was first measured by shadows cast by cliffs or trees. 
The place where the shadow fell at noon was marked, and the rest 
of the time was reckoned by that mark. 
The sundial was probably the first timepiece. It furnished a 
more accurate way of measuring time than observation of tree- 
shadows, but its use was limited to sunny days. 
One day a man, while slowly filling a jar from a spout at a 
spring, saw the sundial move a degree. From this discovery 
was made the first water clock—a tank with an open . 
the bottom through which the water dripped into a basin, 
it in a certain division of time. ‘This sort of timepiece we. —__.. 
for many years. 
The Greeks improved the water clock by placing & 
in the basin. The piston rose with the water and moved — _.W.W.. 
which pointed to the hour on a dial above. This timepiece was 
called the clepsydra. To the clepsydra were added, later, 2 
pendulum and wheels. , 
Several devices for measuring time followed the u 
water clock. Alfred, a king in the early days of England 
the notched candle, the distances between the notches re] 
periods of time. The hourglass came next and was 
reliable timepiece for many years. 
In 1335 an English monk made the first clock. Two centurie

When we think of the numerous things about us that are 
products of mines, we see that we are very dependent upon the 
men who work in them. 
The miner generally enters the mine through a large open- 
ing in the ground, called a shaft. He gets into a basket or a 
cage, which is like an elevator, and is lowered by machinery. 
In the mine the rock and coal have been cut away so that there 
are paths leading in all directions and sometimes even large rooms. 
The roofs of most mines are supported by wooden posts or timbers,

to prevent their caving in; in others large pillars of rock are left 
to serve the same purpose. 
Some mines are now lighted by electricity, but until recently 
the only light came from the flickering lamps or candles that the 
workmen fastened to their caps. 
From some mines a great deal of water must be pumped 
to prevent flooding. The air in them is impure, and sometimes 
the miner comes upon an opening in the rock filled with gas. By f 
means of machinery a continuous current of fresh air is sent to ¢ 
the place where the work is going on, to remove the fire-damp, 
as the gas is called. . 
Drills operated by machinery, and the use of dynamite relieve 
the miner of a great deal of toil. Tramways for transporting coal 
and minerals to the shaft have taken the place of basket-carry-

Sipney Lanier 
A man can never separate what he does from what he is. 
Sidney Lanier, coming to manhood in the hard years of the Civil 
War, and dying of consumption a few years later, drew out of his 
life of hardship only beauty and melody, because his nature was 
fine and sweet and because he loved everything that is good and 
beautiful. 
Sidney Lanier was born in Macon, Georgia, in 1842. A year 
after he was graduated from Oglethorpe College, at eighteen, he 
enlisted in the Confederate army..- He took part in the battle of 
Seven Pines and in the Seven Days Battles around Richmond. In 
1864 he was made a prisoner of war. Instead of hardening or 
roughening his nature, war increased his appreciation of beauti- 
ful things and fixed the dream he had already had of becoming a 
poet and teacher rather than the lawyer his father hoped he 
would be. Even his five months’ stay at Lookout Prigon he used 
as time for writing, for here he composed a novel, Tiger Lilies. 
His confinement shaped his life in another way; it gave him the 
disease with which he courageously fought for fifteen years and 
which finally overeame him while he was yet a young man.

lived for a while in 1872 in San Antonio, Texas, and at another 
time he spent several months in Florida. The sadness of his life 
was added to by the difficulties of his struggle for an actual 
existence, which kept him ‘working at unpleasant literary tasks, 
when, as he himself said, “a thousand melodies are singing in my 
heart that will kill me if I do not utter them soon.” 
Indeed, melodies are singing in all of Lanier’s poems. He was 
as much a musician as he was poet. He played the flute in the 
orchestras of several eities in which he lived. At one time he 
was offered a position with the famous Thomas Orehestra, but he 
was unable to accept it on account of his poor health. 
Lanier was first brought into wide publie notice by being 
chosen to write the Cantata for the Centennial Exposition at 
Philadelphia in 1876. Three years later he was made lecturer on 
English literature at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. 
Lanier’s best known poems are the “Song of the Chattahoo- 
chee,” the “Evening Song,” and “The Marshes of Glynn.” One 
of his poems, “Tampa Robins,” written while he was in Florida, 
you will read in Lesson 88. All of his poems are full of lovely 
sounds and high ideals. 
On the seventh of September, 1881, Sidney Lanier died in the 
mountains of North Carolina.

PocanontTas 
Upon the barren sand 
A single captive stood ; 
Around him came, with bow and brand, 
The red men of the wood. 
Like him of old, his doom he hears, 
Rock-bound on ocean’s brim— 
The chieftain’s daughter Imelt in tears, 
And breathed’ a prayer for him. 
Above his head in air 
The savage war club swung; 
The frantic girl, in wild despair, 
Her arms about him flung. 
Then shook the warriors of the shade, 
Like leaves on aspen limb, 
Subdued by that heroic maid 
Who breathed a prayer for him! 
“Unbind him!” gasped the chief; 
“Tt is your king’s decree!” 
He kissed away the tears of grief, 
And set the captive free! 
’Tis ever thus, when in life’s storm 
Hope’s star to man grows dim, 
An angel kneels, in woman’s form, 
And breathes a prayer for him.

Wat Tusy Founp . 
Once upon a time there was a proud little rooster who decided 
to go upon a journey. 
“T am tired of this dull barnyard, ”* hesaid. “I am going farther 
on, to try to find the best thing in the world. I know what it will 
be—a great big pile of corn as high as a hill.” And off he started. 
Before he had gone very far on the-road he met a squirrel. 
“Where are you going so fast?” asked the,squirrel. 
“I am going to find the best thing in- the world,” said the 
rooster. 
“What may that be?” asked the squirrel. 
“A pile of corn as high as a hill,” answered the little rooster. 
“Oh, yowre very much mistaken about that,” said the squir- 
rel. “The best thing in the world is a pile of nuts as high as a 
mountain. Come with me and we will look for it together.” 
So the squirrel and the little rooster traveled farther along the 
road and soon they met a duck. 
“Where are you two going so fast?” asked the duck. 
“We are trying to find the best thing in the world,” 
the two. 
“And what may that be?” asked the duck. 
“A pile of corn as high as a hill,” said the rooster. 
“A pile of nuts as high as a mountain,” said the squirre’ 
“Oh, no, you’re both mistaken,” said the duck. “Th 
thing in the world is a muddy pond as large as an ocean, 
with me and we will find it.” 
The three traveled to the end of the road, but it was 
journey and a dusty one in the hot sunlight. They wer. rere

tired when they came to the turnstile, and they had found no 
pile of corn and no pile of nutsand“no wide, muddy pond. So 
they turned’ back home again. 
As they were going back they saw an old: woodchyck ditting 
cozily at his tree door and eating his supper. 
“Where have you three béen?” asked the woodchuck. 
“We have been trying to find the best thing in the world,” 
said the three. 
“Why, you passed it early this morning,” said the wood- 
chuck. 
“Where?” asked the three. 
“You left it in the barnyard,” said the woodchuck to the 
little’ rooster. : 
“And you left it in your own home pond,” he said to the 
duck.- oo : “ 
“And you left it in your own tree,” he said to the squirrel. 
“What was it?” asked the three. 
“Contentment,” said the old woodchuck, as he took a big 
bite of apple.

we use is called an indirect quotation.

JEAN Frangors Muer 
On the northwest coast of France, in a little hamlet near Cher- 
bourg, was the childhood home of Jean Frangois Millet, who 
became the world’s greatest painter of peasant life. On one side 
of the town was the rough sea; on the other side were farms and 
apple orchards. The soil was poor and it was only by the hardest 
labor that a living could be made. Most of the inhabitants were 
peasants; a few were fishermen. 
The Millet farm was small.and stony, and both father and 
mother toiled all day in the fields to make a scanty living for 
the family. Francois, the eldest son in a family of nine children, 
helped his father and mother on the farm. His grandmother 
cared for the home and the little ones. : 
At the age of fourteen Francois was obliged to leave school 
to work on the farm. He had only an hour each day for study 
after the day’s hard work was over. He loved to draw, and 
usually spent this hour drawing. As the boy watched the flocks 
he sketched the trees, the fields, and the peasants. Nature 
was his teacher and model. After a time the drawings became 
so good that, those who saw them were astonished that a boy should 
produce work of so much merit. 
When the other boys were old enough to work and Francois 
could be spared from home, his father took him to Cherbourg 
to take lessons from an artist. He progressed so well in his art 
that the city of Cherbourg gave him money to go to Paris for 
further study. Here he remained for some time, but he had a severe 
struggle to gain a living, often suffering from cold and hunger. 
At the end of ten years Millet moved to Barbizon, wher, 
he again saw peasants working in the fields, saw the flocks o 
sheep, and breathed the free air of the country. He found j 
Barbizon the work he loved; he painted the peasant life abou 
him. He did not make the peasants pretty; he painted them al 
he knew them to be — often hungry, tired, and discouraged, y, 
faithful to duty. He saw them working from four o’clock in t¢
-P-A-G-E-118

morning until so late at night that they could no longer see. 
Thus had his father and mother worked in the fields, and thus 
had he worked, and he sympathized greatly with these tired 
creatures. . 
For many years he was unable to sell his pictures, but grad- 
ually they began to be appreciated and brought higher and 
higher prices. Most of his finest pictures are now owned in 
America,

APOLLO, THE SuN Gop 
Apollo, the sun god, was supposed to live in a beautiful 
palace in the far east. Every morning his white steeds were 
harnessed to the sun chariot and away he would go on his 
journey across the sky. No one but Apollo could drive these 
horses, for they were very spirited. 
Apollo did not go alone, but was attended by the Hours, 
the Graces, and Love. There weré four Hours, one for each 
season of the year; their work was to see that everything was 
done at exactly the right time. The three Graces always went 
hand in hand with the Hours; their work was to see that every- 
thing was done well. Aurora, the goddess of the dawn, guided 
the way. To make the party complete they took with them 
Cupid, the god of love. 
As Apollo drove on, a brilliant light streamed from his 
flaming chariot, awakening the earth with its bright, warm rays. 
Soon day appeared with all its brightness and splendor. 
Toward evening Apollo descended the slopes of the western 
sky until he came to a golden boat that was waiting to carry 
him back in safety to his eastern palace.

Tuomas A. Epison 
Thomas Alva Edison was born in Milan, Ohio, in 1847. 
His education was limited to the instruction given him by his 
mother and to what he gained for himself by reading. At one 
time he decided to read every book in the free library, but after 
reading fifteen feet of closely packed books he realized that be 
would never be able to finish his task. “+ 
At the age of twelve he secured a position as newsboy on 
the Grand Trunk Railroad. He fitted. out a small printing press 
in one corner of the baggage car and for a time was the proud 
“publisher of “The Grand TrunkHerald.” 
He turned-the basement of his home into a workshop, where 
he experimented with telegraphy. For batteries he used old 
bottles, nails, and pieces ziné that he bought from other 
boys for three cents a pound. At, one time he and a friend 
stretched between their homes an underground wire insulated. 
with bottles.

He learned telegraphy from the station” master at Mt. 
Clemens, Michigan, and at the age of eighteen got his first regular 
position as telegraph operator in Indianapolis. He soon became 
known as a careful and quick telegrapher and was offered a good 
position in Boston. During his stay there he invented the electrical 
vote recorder and received his first patent. 
From Boston Mr. Edison went to New York. He contin- 
ued to invent new and better ways of using electricity. His 
employers soon recognized the value of his inventions and made 
him an offer of $40,000 for them. Mr. Edison gladly accepted 
the offer, and used the money to fit up a workshop for experimenting. 
From that time on he has been busy giving inventions to the 
world. 
Among his most important inventions are the electric light 
and the phonograph. — Selected.

Hurrah for a ride on the prairies free 
On a fiery untamed steed, 
Where the curlews fly and the coyotes cry, 
And a fragrant breeze goes whispering by; 
Hurrah! and away with speed. 
With left hand high on the bridle-rein, 
And saddle girths cinched behind, 
With lariat tied at the pommel’s side, 
And lusty bronchos true and tried, _ 
We'll race with the whistling wind. 
We are off and away, like a flash of light, 
As swift as the shooting star; 
As an arrow flies toward its distant prize, 
O! on we whirl toward the shimmering skies; 
Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! 
As free as a bird o’er billowy sea 
We skim the flowered Divide; 
Like sea mews strong we fly along, 
While the earth resounds with galloping song 
As we plunge through the fragrant tide. 
Avaunt with your rides i crowded towns!

Grace DarLine 
Grace. Darling lived with her father, the keeper of Long- 
stone Lighthouse, on the northeast coast of England. 
One ‘wild, stormy night, as she lay in her little room, she 
heard’ cries for help. She sprang out of bed and called her 
father.’ Both dressed quickly and went out on the rocks, but 
it was so: dark they could not sce anything, nor could they hear 
anything above the noise of the storm. There was nothing for 
them to. do but go back to the house and wait for daylight. 
As soon as it grew light enough to see, they went out again. 
Now they could see the wreck and, by looking through Mr. 
Darling’s glass, they could see people clinging to the vessel. 
Mr. Darling shook his head sorrowfully, saying, “We cannot 
help them. Our boat could not live in a sea like this.” 
“Father, we must save them. I can’t stand here and’ see 
them’ die.” Grace ran to the boat, jumped in, and got the 
oars ready. Mr. Darling could not see her go alone; so he got 
in, too, and together they rowed toward the wreck. 
The people clinging to the vessel saw them coming. How 
anxiously they watched the boat! Sometimes it seemed as 
though the angry waves would surely swallow it. But at last 
the boat reached them and one by one nine persons were taken’ 
from the wreck and carried safely to the lighthouse, where Grace 
took care of them. 
Soon all England heard of Grace Darling and her heroic deed.

Serine in Kenrucky 
March is a month when the needle oftmy nature dips toward 
the country. I am away, greeting everything as it wakes out of 
a winter sleep, stretches arms upward and legs downward, and 
drinks goblet after goblet of young sunshine. I must find the 
dark green snowdrop and sometimes help to remove from her 
head, as she lifts it slowly from. her couch, the frosted nighteap 
which the old nurse would insist that she should wear. 
But most I love to see Nature do her spring house-cleaning 
in Kentucky, with the rain clouds for her water buckets, and 
the wind for her brooms. What an amount of drenching and 
sweeping she can do in a day! How she dashes pailfuls into 
every dirty corner, till the whole earth is as clean as a new floor! 
Another day she attacks the piles of dead leaves, where they 
have lain since last October, and scatters them in a trice, so 
that every cranny may be sunned and aired. Or, grasping her 
long brooms by the handles, she will go into the woods and beat 
the icicles off the big trees as a housewife would brush down 
cobwebs. 
This done, she begins to hang up soft, new curtains at the 
forest windows and to spread over her floor a new carpet of an 
emerald loveliness such as no mortal looms could ever have - 
woven. 
And then, at last, she sends out invitations through the south 
for the birds to come and spend the summer in Kentucky. The 
invitations are sent out in March, and accepted in April and May, 
and by June her house is full of visitors.

Sprinkle the beds every day, if necessary, until the plants 
are one inch high. 
Do not allow the soil to become dry. 
When the plants are two or three inches high, sprinkle thor- 
oughly every few days, instead of lightly every day. 
Water in the morning and evening. 
(d) Trwnine Piants 1n THE GARDEN 
Avoid having plants too crowded. 
Thin the plants when they are two or three inches high, on 
a cloudy day when the soil is moist.

Lesson 143 — LireraTURE 
1. Reading. 
GARDENING 
“Fternal gardening is the price of liberty” is a motto that 
I should put over the gateway of my garden, if I had a gate. 
And yet it is not wholly true; for there is no liberty in gardening. 
The man who undertakes a garden has planted a seed that will 
keep him awake nights, drive rest from his bones, and sleep from 
his pillow. Hardly is the garden planted when he must begin to 
hoe it. The weeds have sprung up all over it in a night. They 
shine and wave in redundant life. 
And the weeds are not all. I awake in the morning (and a 
thriving garden will wake a person up two hours before he ought 
to be out of bed) and think of the tomato plants — the leaves like 
fine lacework, owing to black. bugs that skip around and can’t be 
caught. Somebody ought to get up before the dew is off and sprinkle 
soot on the leaves. I wonder if it is I. Soot is so much blacker 
than bugs that they are disgusted and go away. You can’t get 
up too early if you have a garden. I think that, on the whole, 
it would be best to sit up all night and sleep daytimes. Things 
appear to go on in the night in the garden uncommonly. It would 
be less trouble to stay up than it is to get up so early. 
— Charles Dudley Warner.

For the wind to play its tunes upon, 
And a paper birch, so white and fine,

Right over the gate where they grow up tall, - 
And a maple for tiny blooms in March, 
And scarlet leaves in the early fall.

  Lesson 150 ~— LirpraturE 
1. Reading. 
Prpra’s Houipay 
Pippa lived in a large factory town. The great mills were 
built on the banks of the river, that its power might turn their 
machinery. There were many of these mills, for here were manu- 
factured great bolts of silk and thousands of spools of silk thread 
every day. 
Little Pippa worked in one of the great mills every day. 
She loved the bright colors of the dyes, loved to guide the shin- 
ing threads truly and firmly on the shuttle or spool. She was 
happy when she met a beautiful woman, clothed in wonderful 
silks, for she would whisper to herself, “How beautiful you are! 
I helped to make you look beautiful.” 
Every week day but one through all the year Pippa worked 
in the factory. One day each year she had for her very own — 
one bright, perfect, wonderful day. Pippa called it “my own day.”’ 
She was glad when each Sabbath came, glad to go into the great, 
wonderfully lighted church, and the Sabbath she called God’s 
day. But this one day was her own; from morning till night she 
could do what she pleased. . 
One day when she came home from work, she said, “To- 
morrow will be my own day.” And before she went to sleep 
she looked out at the great starry heaven and whispered softly, 
“Please make my day a bright day.” She slept soundly all 
night, and when she opened her eyes in the morning her first, 
thought was, “Is it a sunny day?” 
Jumping out of bed, she ran to the window and looked 
144

PART ONE 145 
out; and, oh, what a bright, sunny world greeted her! It 
filled her heart with joy, and she sang her happiest, gladdest 
song: : 
“The year’s at the spring 
And day’s at the morn; 
Morning’s at seven; 
The hillside’s dew-pearled; 
The lark’s on the wing; 
The snail’s on the thorn; 
God’s in his heaven — 
All’s right with the world.” 
She dressed quickly, ate her simple breakfast,- and went 
out of doors, for she always spent her own day, if possible, in 
the woods. The woods were a long way from her house, but 
she liked to walk; so on she went, singing all the way, her little 
bare feet making marks in the sand. Little Pippa wore shoes 
only in the coldest weather. 
As she went, singing all the way, Pippa passed a house where 
a blind woman lived. The blind woman was sitting on her 
porch —sad and still. She thought the world was a dreary 
place to live in, very dark and lonely; but, as Pippa ran by, 
the woman heard her glad little song, 
“God’s in his heaven — 
All’s right with the world.” 
It made her day bright, and she said, “Why, it’s true; 
all’s well with my world. God’s in his heaven.” 
'. Little Pippa ran singing along, until she came to the house 
of a great artist — man who painted such wonderful pictures 
that they seemed to be really living. But this morning his 
paints did not work to please him and he felt dissatisfied and 
unhappy. Suddenly. he heard Pippa’s clear voice caroling like a 
bird’s as she ran by. He hurried to the door and saw Pippa, 
her face raised to the sky she loved so dearly, her hat hanging 
by the strings around her neck, her hair shining like gold in the 11

sun, and her little bare, white feet pattering along, as her voice 
rang out, clear and sweet, 
“God’s in his heaven — 
All’s right with the world.” 
The artist painted her picture, just as he saw her, and he called 
it “Joy.” It was a wonderful picture — the most beautiful one 
he had ever painted. 
Pippa ran on and on, until she came to a man sitting by 
the roadside. He should have been doing his Master’s work, ~ 
but he was discouraged, and he did not feel brave enough or 
good enough or strong enough. When he heard Pippa’s song 
and saw her flit by, he suddenly knew that he was strong and 
brave and good. So he rose and went about his Master’s work. 
Pippa ran on, and found her woods. Never before did the 
birds sing more merrily, the river shine and ripple and gurgle 
more cheerily, or more perfect flowers grow for her pleasure. 
All the wonders of the woods came out to add to her joy, and 
she went home with her dress full of flowers. 
Perhaps she was tired, but she was happy, and she whispered 
softly to the stars, “I did not find anyone to help; so I just 
helped myself to be happy and good and full of joy. You 
understand, O God, in Your heaven.” 
. — Carolyn 8. Bailey.

One fine summer day a Grasshopper was out in a. field. 
She felt so gay that she sang and sang, and was as happy as the 
day was long. 
By and by an Ant came along; she had a grain of corn 
which she was taking to her home. The Ant was small, and 
it was hard work for her to drag and roll the grain along. 
“Why not come and chat with me?” said the Grasshopper. 
“Why do you spend the whole day toiling in that way?” 
“T am helping to lay up food for the winter,” said the Ant. 
~“T should advise you to do the same thing.” 
“Why bother about winter?” said the Grasshopper. “We 
have plenty of food now, and winter is a long way off.” 
But the Ant went on her way and kept on toiling all day. 
When winter came, the Grasshopper had no food. She went 
to borrow from the Ant; but she would not lend, since she 
had only grain enough for her own use. . 
The Grasshopper was left to starve, while the Ant lived all

He traveled along a rather dark path for some little time

shild said, “T am always at play. Come and play with me!” 
So he played. with the child the whole day long, and they 
were very merry. The sky was so blue, the sun was so bright, 
the water was so sparkling, the leaves were so green, the flowers 
were so lovely, and they heard such singing birds, and saw so 
many butterflies, that everything was beautiful. This was in fine 
weather. When it rained, they liked to watch the falling drops 
and to smell the fresh scents. When it blew, it was delightful to 
listen to the wind, and fancy what it said, as it came rushing 
from its home —where was that, they wondered? — whistling 
and howling, driving the clouds before it, bending the trees,

rumbling in the chimneys, shaking the house, and making the sea 
roar in fury. But when it snowed, that was best of all; for they 
liked nothing so well as to look up at the white flakes falling 
fast and thick, like down from the breasts of millions of white 
birds; and to see how smooth and deep the drift was; and to 
listen to the hush upon the paths and roads. 
They had plenty of the finest toys in the world, and the most 
astonishing picture books; all about scimitars and slippers and 
turbans and dwarfs and giants and genii and fairies and blue- 
beards and beanstalks and riches and caverns and forests, and all 
new and all true. 
But suddenly, one day, the traveler lost the child. He called 
to him over and over again, but got no answer. So he went 
upon his road, and went on for a little while without meeting 
anything, until at last he came to a handsome boy. So he 
said’ to the boy, “What do you do here?” And the boy said, 
“T am always learning. Come and learn with me.” 
So he learned with that boy about Jupiter and Juno, and the 
Greeks and the Romans, and I don’t know what, and learned more 
than I could tell —or he either, for he soon forgot a great deal 
of it. But they were not always learning; they had the merriest 
games that ever were played. They rowed upon the river in 
summer, and skated on the ice in winter; they were active afoot 
and active on horseback, at cricket and at all games of ball; 
at prisoners’ base, hare and hounds, follow my leader, and more 
sports than I can think of; nobody could beat them. They had 
holidays, too, and Twelfth cakes, and parties where they danced 
till midnight, and real theaters where they saw palaces of real 
gold and silver rise out of the real earth, and saw all the wonde 
of the world at once. As to friends, they had such dear frien. 
and so many of them, that I lack the time to reckon them up. 
They. were all young, like the handsome boy, and were never t. 
be strange to one another all their lives through. 
Still, one day, in the midst of all these pleasures, the travele 
lost the boy as he had Jest the child, and after calling to him i 
vain went on upon his journey.

In some cases the division of a story into paragraphs 
may be easily made; in other cases it is difficult to make, 
because a sentence may refer to the thought of two para- 
graphs and may be properly placed in either. Paragraphing, 
therefore, cannot always be determined with absolute 
exactness. . 
The author of the following selection wrote it in two 
paragraphs, but it is printed here in one. Where do you 
think the second paragraph began as the author wrote it? 
Give a reason for your answer. 
As Gluck gazed, fresh grass sprang beside the new streams, 
and creeping plants grew and climbed among the moistening 
soil. Young flowers opened suddenly along the river sides, as 
stars leap out when twilight is deepening, and thickets of myrtle 
and tendrils of vine cast lengthening shadows over the valley as 
they grew. And thus the Treasure Valley became a garden 
again, and the inheritance which had been lost by cruelty was 
tegained by love. And Gluck went and dwelt in the valley, 
and the poor were never driven from his door; so that his barns 
became full of corn, and his house of treasure. For him the 
river had, according to the dwarf’s promise, become a River 
of Gold. —John Ruskin.

Lxsson 5— Puncruatinc Direct QuoTaTIONS 
1. Development. 
(a) You have learned that when we use the exact words 
of another person, we are said to quote them. To show 
that the exact words are repeated we use quotation marks 
before and after the words. The mark (‘) is put before 
the quoted words, and the mark (’’) after them. 
Example: - 
The daisies say, “We dance.” 
(6) When a long quotation continues through more than 
one paragraph or stanza, the mark (“‘) is repeated at the 
beginning of each paragraph or stanza, but the mark (’’) 
is not used until the whole quotation ends. Find an example 
of this rule on page 15. 
(c) A short quotation is separated from the preceding 
part of the sentence that contains it, by a comma. See 
the second paragraph on page 157. If the quotation is 
long, a colon generally precedes it. See the last paragraph 
on page 54. 
(d) In a direct quotation that consists of one or more 
sentences, each sentence begins with a capital letter. Find 
an example in the second paragraph on page 157. 
(e€) Quoted sentences should be followed by the marks 
they would require if not quoted, except that a comma is 
used in place of a period when the main sentence continues 
after the quotation ends. The question mark and the 
exclamation mark, when they end a quotation, are placed 
inside the quotation mark. 
Examples: 
1. “I am always learning,” said the boy. 
2, “Hurrah for the snow!” called the child. 
3. “Will you play with me?” asked the child.
-P-A-G-E-177
164 GOOD ENGLISH 
(f) Sometimes we find a quotation that has within it 
another quotation. For a quotation within a quotation 
single marks (‘) and (’) are used. - 
Example: 
Dickens tells us, ‘The traveler asked the boy, ‘What are you 
doing?’ and the boy answered, ‘I am always learning.’” 
(g) Each part of a divided quotation is enclosed in quo- 
tation marks. Find an example of this rule on page 15.

1. Reading. 
Read again the lines from “The Child’s Story” which 
tell of the books read by the chiidren. 
In some of their books they doubtless read of King 
Arthur and his knights. 
Tus Kine Wao Taucur Men ro Smrve 
Many years ago, there reigned in Britain a king who was so 
brave and good that his name and deeds are still remembered, 
though many who came after him have been forgotten. 
We do not know exactly when this great king, who was 
named Arthur, lived. The stories told by fathers to their 
children and the songs sung by the minstrels kept alive the 
memory of his goodness and greatness, but the year of his birth 
was forgotten. It is thought that he livéd in the sixth century, 
but to all who know the story of the Round Table, Arthur and 
his knights are so real that they do not belong to one century, 
but to all time.
-P-A-G-E-182
PART TWO 169 
For many years before Arthur became king, Britain was in a 
most unhappy condition. The country was divided into many 
small kingdoms, each having its own ruler. These kings were 
constantly at war with one another and the fierce nobles fought 
among themselves and refused to obey any laws. More terrible 
still for the unhappy people of Britain were frequent invasions 
by savage tribes from the continent, who robbed and murdered 
and laid the country waste, so that wild beasts prowled in many 
places where farms and cottages had once. stood. 
Arthur’s first work was to drive out these invaders from his 
land. With the help of the brave men who had made him king, 
this was at last accomplished, but twelve great battles were 
fought before it was done. 
When Arthur was crowned, the work of uniting the kingdom 
was begun, for many of the best and bravest nobles pledged 
allegiance to him at that time. The rulers of many of the 
small kingdoms, however, refused to acknowledge Arthur as their 
king and led others to join them in making war upon him 
There was a terrible battle, but Arthur and his men fought so 
bravely that at last the rebels fled. 
Arthur realized that the unhappy condition of his country 
was due to the fact that men were thinking only of themselves 
and not caring what happened to others. He saw that many . 
- wanted to command and few were willing to obey. There were 
many brave men in the country, but few had learned to show 
mercy. Much evil talking was done, for the people’ had no 
books to read and when they were not working or fighting, they 
loved to listen to anyone who had a story to tell of something 
he had seen or heard. : 
Arthur knew that he must do more than drive out invaders, 
put down rebellions, and punish law breakers. Until the strong 
man used his strength to protect the weak and each one thought 
of what he could do for others, instead of what others should do 
for him, there would be evil speaking, oppression, and cruelty. 
So the famous company or order of the Round Table was 
formed of men who promised to live pure lives, to speak the 
truth, to right. wrong, and to follow the King. Arthur’s. hope

was that all men would follow the noble example set by his 
knights. The great English poet, Tennyson, has given us this 
picture of the forming of the Round Table by King Arthur: 
“T made them lay their hands in mine and swear 
To reverence the King, as if he were 
Their conscience, and their conscience as their King. 
To ride abroad redressing human wrongs, 
To speak no slander, no, nor listen to it, 
To honor his own word as if his God’s.’”, 
Then, while crowds of happy people watched and listened, 
the knights marched before the king and sang a glorious song: 
“Blow trumpet, for the world is white with May! 
Blow trumpet, the long night hath roll’d away! 
Blow through the living world — ‘Let the King reign!’”

1. Reading. . 
, Goine Away to Scuoon 
The morning was cloudy and threatened rain; besides, it was 
autumn weather, and the winds were getting harsh, and rustling 
among the tree-tops that shaded the house, most dismally. I did 
not dare to listen. If, indeed, I were to stay by the bright fires 
of home, and gather the nuts as they fell, and pile up the falling 
leaves to make great bonfires with Ben and the rest of the boys, 
I should have liked to listen, and would have braved the dismal 
morning with the cheerfulest of them all. For it would have 
been a capital time to light a fire in the little oven we had built 
under the wall; it would have been so pleasant to warm our 
fingers at it, and to roast the great russets on the flat stones that 
made the top. —_ 
But this was not in store for me. I had bid the town boys 
good-bye the day before; my trunk was all packed; I was to go 
away to school. The little oven would go to ruin—TI knew it 
would. I was to leave. my home. I was to bid my mother 
good-bye, and Lilly and Isabel and all the rest; and was to go 
away from them so far that I should only know what they were 
all doing in letters. And then to have the clouds come over 
on that morning, and the winds sigh so dismally; it was too bad, 
I thought. 
I remember that the pigeons skulked under the eaves of the 
carriage-house, and did not sit, as they used to do in summer, 
upon the ridge; and the chickens huddled together about the 
stable-doors as if they were afraid of the cold autumn. And in 
the garden the white hollyhocks stood shivering, and bowed to

the wind as if their time had come. The yellow muskmelons 
showed plain among the frostbitten vines, and looked cold and 
uncomfortable. 
Then they were all so kind indoors. The cook made such nice 
things for my breakfast because little master was going; Lilly 
would give me her seat by-the fire, and would put her lump of 
sugar into my cup; and my mother looked so smiling and so 
tender, that I thought I loved her more than I ever did before. 
Little Ben was so gay, too; and wanted me to take his jack- 
knife, if I wished it, though he knew that I had a brand-new one 
in my trunk. The old nurse slipped a little purse into my hand, 
tied up with a green ribbon, with money in it, and told me not 
to show it to Ben or Lilly. 
At length Ben came running in, and said the coach had come; 
and there, sure enough, out of the window we saw it, a bright 
yellow coach, with four white horses, and bandboxes all over the 
top, with a great pile of trunks behind. 
There was a tall boy in the coach, and I was ashamed to have 
him see me cry; so I didn’t, at first. But I remember, as I 
looked back and saw little Isabel run out into the middle of the 
street to see the coach go off, and the curls floating behind her 
as the wind freshened, I felt my heart leaping into my throat, 
and the water coming into my eyes, and how just then I caught 
sight of the tall boy glancing at me, and how I tried to turn it 
off by looking to see if I could button my greatcoat a great deal 
lower down than the buttonholes went. 
But it was of no use. I put my head out of the coach win-

1. Reading. . 
Tus Humuine Brrp 
No sooner has the returning sun again caused millions of plants 
to expand their leaves and blossoms to his genial beams, than the 
little humming bird is seen advancing on fairy wings, carefully 
visiting every opening flower-cup, and, like a curious florist, remov- 
ing from each the injurious insects that otherwise would ere long 
cause its beauteous petals to droop and decay. Poised in the 
air, it is observed peeping cautiously, and with sparkling eye, 
into their innermost recesses; whilst the motions of its pinions, 
so rapid and so light, appear to fan and cool the flower, and pro- 
duce a delightful murmuring sound, well adapted for lulling the 
insects to repose. 
The prairies, the fields, the orchards and gardens — nay, the 
deepest shades of the forest — are all visited in their turn; and 
everywhere the little bird meets with pleasure and with food. 
Its gorgeous throat in beauty and brilliancy baffles all competi- 
tion, Now it glows with a fiery hue, and again it is changed to 
the deepest velvety black. The upper parts of its delicate body 
are of resplendent changing green. It moves from one flower to 
another like a gleam of light — upwards, downwards, to the right, 
and to the left. In this manner it searches the extreme northern 
portions of our country, following with great precaution the 
advances of the season; and retreats with equal care at the 
approach of autumn. 
— John James Audubon.

Of wailing winds, and naked woods, and meadows brown

They rustle to the eddying gust, and to the rabbit’s tread.

And from the wood-top calls the crow, through all the

of the boy’s start upon his journey. 
Have you ever gone upon a trip, by railway train, steam- 
ship, trolley car, automobile, or stagecoach, on a dismal 
morning? If so, you will understand how the boy felt. 
If you have, relate your experience; if not, tell in your 
own words of the boy’s start upon his journey. 
First make an outline for your story; this will help you 
to talk connectedly. Select incidents that: will be interesting 
to others, and then think of the groups into which these 
incidents naturally fall. In this way you will determine 
the topic for each paragraph. 
The following questions will help you:

topic of your first paragraph. 
2. What should you tell next? Your answer will be the

Lusson 32 — Teturne a Story WELL 
1. Two Important Rules. 
If you listen to two boys talking, you will usually find 
that they are telling of actions which they or someone else 
performed, This conversation is made up largely of story 
telling, or narration, as it is often called. The same thing is 
true of most conversation that you hear. Men and women, 
as well as boys and girls, talk about what they have done, 
and are interested in knowing what other people have 
done. : 
We tell stories every day about what we did and saw 
and*what someone else did and saw, but we do not always 
tell our stories well. Sometimes we crowd in unimportant 
things that interest no one. Sometimes we tell the ending 
of a story before the beginning, and sometimes we leave out 
the best part of the story. 
Suppose that when you return home from school your 
mother should ask, “What did you do in school today?” 
How would you answer? Would you begin your story by 
telling at which gate you entered the schoolyard, how many 
steps you climbed to reach your room, on which nail in the 
coatroom you hung your hat, and whether you walked 
across the front or the back of the room to your seat? Are 
those the things your mother would like to know? Of 
course they are not. 
What would your mother like to hear about your day 
at school? How you recited in your history lesson, an 
how you worked your arithmetic problems, would interes.

PART TWO 191 
her. She would like to know whether or not you were 
attentive to your lessons, polite to your teacher, and kind 
to your classmates. She would like to know about any 
pleasure that you had today. If you had any trouble, she 
would like to know about that, also. 
Your story, or narration, should be an account of the 
most interesting events of the day. If something of unusual 
interest occurred, your story might deal entirely with that 
event. 
To make a good narration we must choose interesting 
events and tell them in the best order from the beginning to 
the end, so that our readers or hearers will understand and 
be interested every moment. With these two important 
rules of good story telling in mind, read again the selection 
in Lesson 17. Does the author of the story observe these 
principles? 
2. Oral Narration. 
Be prepared to take part with others of your class in 
telling the story of Lesson 17. Select the interesting incidents 
and tell them in the best order. 
Lesson 33 — Duscrisina THines WELL 
1. The Importance of Description. 
The kind of speaking or writing that gives a good pic- 
ture of some object, person, or scene by telling about its 
appearance or naming its ‘qualities is called description. 
“Going Away to School” is a narrative selection, but 
you have seen that it contains some beautiful descriptions. 
Read again the third paragraph and notice the descriptions. 
Description does not, as a rule, add to the action of a 
story, but to its clearness, interest, and beauty. You will
-P-A-G-E-205
192 GOOD ENGLISH 
not find many stories that do not contain some descriptions 
of persons or things. 
The old fairy tales and folk tales are examples of narra- 
tion without much description. They are simple, straight- 
forward stories and your imagination must do what the 
story teller did not do; that is, you must picture the places 
and the characters. If all writers had followed the method 
of the old story tellers, we should have lost much of our 
most delightful literature. 
The ability to describe accurately will be of great’ value 
to you in giving information to others. Then, too, if you 
can describe a place or a scene in an interesting manner, 
you will be able to give pleasure to those who have not had 
‘the opportunity of seeing what you have seen. 
Read the following from Irving’s description of Ichabod 
Crane’s schoolhouse: 
His schoolhouse was a low building of one large room, rudely 
constructed of logs; the windows partly glazed, and partly patched. 
with leaves of old copy-books. It was most ingeniously secured at 
vacant hours by a withe twisted in the handle of the door, and 
stakes set, against’ the window shutters; so that, though a thief 
might get in with perfect ease, he would find some embarrassment 
in getting out. The schoolhouse stood in a rather lonely but 
pleasant situation, just at the foot of a woody hill, with a brook 
running elose by, and a formidable birch tree growing at one end 
of it.

It was late in mild October, and the long autumnal rain 
Had left the summer harvest-fields all green with grass again ; 
The first sharp frosts had fallen, leaving all the woodlands gay 
With the hues of summer’s rainbow, or the meadow-flowers 
of May. 
Through a thin, dry mist, that morning, the sun rose broad 
and red, 
At first a rayless disk of fire, he brightened as he sped; 
Yet, even his noontide glory fell chastened and subdued, 
On the cornfields and the orchards, and softly pictured wood. 
And all that quiet afternoon, slow sloping to the night, 
He wove with golden shuttle the haze with yellow light; 
Slanting through the painted beeches, he glorified the hill; 
And, beneath it, pond and meadow lay brighter, greener still. 
And shouting boys in woodland haunts caught glimpses of 
that sky, 
Flecked by the many-tinted leaves, and laughed, they knew 
not why; 
And school-girls, gay with aster-flowers, beside the meadow 
brooks, 
Mingled the glow of autumn with the sunshine of sweet looks,|

From spire and barn looked westerly the patient weather- 
cocks; 
But even the birches on the hill stood motionless as rocks. . 
No sound was in the woodlands, save the squirrel’s dropping 
shell, : 
And the yellow leaves among the boughs, low rustling as they 
fell. : 
The summer grains were harvested; the stubble-fields lay dry, 
Where June winds rolled, in light and shade, the pale green 
waves of rye; 
But still, on gentle hill-slopes, in valleys fringed with wood, 
Ungathered, bleaching in the sun, the heavy corn crop stood. 
Bent low, by autumn’s wind and rain, through husks that, 
dry and sear, 
Unfolded from their ripened charge, shone out the yellow éar; 
Beneath, the turnip lay concealed, in many a verdant fold, 
And glistened in the slanting light the pumpkin’s sphere of 
gold. 
There wrought the busy harvesters; and many a creaking wain 
Bore slowly to the long barn-floor its load of husk and grain; 
Till broad and red, as when he rose, the sun sank down, at last, 
And like a merry guest’s farewell, the day in brightness passed. 
And lo! as through the western pines, on meadow, stream, 
and pond, 
Flamed the red radiance of a sky, set all afire beyond, 
Slowly o’er the eastern sea-blufis a milder glory shone, 
And the sunset and the moonrise were mingled into one! 
— John Greenleaf Whittier.

shows possession of something by ome squirrel. If we wish 
to show possession by more than one squirrel, we write the 
plural form, squirrels, and add the apostrophe, thus, 
squirrels’. We do not add another s, if the plural form of

Lzsson 39 — Maxine a Cunar EXPLANATION 
1. How to Make a Clear Explanation. 
You have already been made familiar with narration 
and description, but have you ever thought that some of 
your talk in school and outside is neither: narration nor 
description? 
When your teacher explains a problem in arithmetic, she 
does not tell you a story (narration), nor does she give a 
description of the problem. When you explain to your: 
little brother why his kite will not fly and tell him how to 
improve it, your talk is something quite different from 
narration or description. 
In giving an explanation, you must be careful to tell 
things in their proper order, and to include everything 
that is necessary to a clear understanding of the subject. 
An outline will help you to do this. 
It is well to remember, however, that our ordinary speak- 
ing or writing does not consist entirely of description, 
narration, or explanation, but generally includes two or more 
of these. For example, in explaining how to make some- 
thing, you may need to describe things that you use, and 
you may also narrate things that you do. 
Read the following example of explanation: 
How to Maske Potaro Cakus 
Pare a few nice, white potatoes and boil them until quite soft. 
It does not matter how much they break, so long as they remain 
mealy. Take one third of the weight of the potatoes in flour and 
mix the potatoes and flour well together. If the dough is too 
dry to roll out, moisten it with a little milk or a small piece of 
butter. Dredge the board with flour and roll the paste to about 
half an inch in thickness. Cut it into cakes either round or 
square. Have a very hot griddle ready. No grease should be 
used. Place the cakes on the griddle and turn them several

2. There the busy harvesters worked day after day. 
3. There was a heavy corn crop on the farm. 
What does their tell you in sentence 1? 
What does there tell you in sentence 2? 
In sentence 3, there is used merely as an introductory 
word; the sentence simply means, “A heavy corn crop was 
on the farm.” There adds nothing to the meaning of 
this sentence, but introduces the thought more smoothly 
and makes it seem more complete.

Lusson 43 — Common anp Prorrr Nouns 
1. Development. 
You have learned that words which name persons, places, 
or things are called nouns. 
Make a list of the nouns found in the first two stanzas of 
the poem in Lesson 42. Which of these nouns begin with 
eapital letters? 
You will notice that all these capitalized nouns name 
particular persons, places, or things. The nouns that do 
not begin with capital letters name any one of a class of 
persons, places, or things. For example, the noun lake is 
a name for any one of a class of things but Superior is 
the name of a particular lake and is begun with a capital 
letter. The noun ocean is a name for one of a class of 
things and is not begun with a capital letter, but 
Atlantic is the name of a particular ocean and is always 
begun with a capital letter. When the general name is 
used as a part of the particular name it, also, is capital- 
ized; thus, Lake Superior. The nouns country, land, or 
nation may each be used to name one of a class, but 
Columbia, Chile, France, and England are names of 
particular countries and must be begun -with capital
-P-A-G-E-218
PART TWO _ 205 
letters. The noun republic may name any one of a 
class, but when the poet wrote “the great Republic,” 
she meant a particular nation, our own United States of 
America. The, nouns east, west, north, and south, when used 
to name directions, are not capitalized. When these nouns 
are used to name particular regions of a country, they are 
begun with capital letters, as the East, the West, the North, 
and the South. 
A noun that names a particular person, place, or thing 
is called a proper noun. 
A noun that names one or more of a class of persons, 
places, or things is called a common noun.

A proper noun begins with a capital letter.

2. The Adjective. 
The words ray and motion are names of things and are 
therefore nouns. Rayless and motionless are describing 
words. What does each word describe? 
Describing words are called adjectives. 
The adjectives brighter, greener, and milder, appear in 
the poem of Lesson 35. Brighter and greener describe the 
pond and the meadow; milder describes the glory of the 
moon.

If we compare three meadows, we say one is the greenest

is added to the adjective which describes one of them. Est 
is not added unless you are comparing more than two 
persons or things.

Returninc Home ror tHe Howpays 
In the course of a December tour in Yorkshire, I rode for a 
long distance in one. of the public coaches, on the day preceding 
Christmas. The coach was crowded, both inside and out, with 
passengers, who, by their talk, seemed principally bound to the 
mansions of relations or friends, to eat the Christmas dinner. It 
was loaded also with hampers of game, and baskets and boxes of 
delicacies; and hares hung dangling their long ears about the 
coachman’s box, presents from distant friends for the impend- 
ing feast. . 
I had three fine rosy-cheeked boys for my fellow-passengers. 
inside. They were returning home for the holidays in high glee, 
and promising themselves a world of enjoyment. It was delight- 
ful to hear the gigantic plans of the little rogues, and the imprac- 
ticable feats they were to perform during their six weeks’ eman- 
cipation from book, birch, and pedagogue. 
They were full of anticipations of the meeting with the family 
and household, down to the very cat and dog; and of the joy 
they were to give their little sisters by the presents with which 
their pockets were crammed; but the meeting to which they 
seemed to look forward with the greatest impatience was with 
Bantam, which I found to be a pony, and, according to their 
talk, possessed of more virtues than any steed since the days of 
Bucephalus. How he could trot! how he could run! and then 
such leaps as he would take — there was not a hedge in the 
whole country that he could not clear. .

212 GOOD ENGLISH 
My little traveling companions had been looking out of the 
coach windows for the last few miles, recognizing every tree and 
cottage as they approached home, and now there was a general 
burst of joy. “There’s John! and there’s old Carlo! and there’s 
Bantam!” cried the happy little rogues, clapping their hands. 
At the end of the Jane there was an old, sober-looking servant 
in livery, waiting for them; he was accompanied by a pointer, 
and by Bantam, a little old rat of a pony, with a shaggy mane 
and long, rusty tail, who stood dozing quietly by the roadside, 
little dreaming of the bustling times that awaited him. 
I was pleased to see the fondness with which the little fellows 
leaped about the steady old footman and hugged the pointer, 
who wriggled his whole body for joy. But Bantam was the great 
object of interest; all wanted to mount at once, and it was with 
some difficulty that John arranged that they should ride by 
turns, and the eldest should ride first. 
Off they set at last; one on the pony, with the dog bounding 
and barking before him, and the others holding John’s hands; 
both talking at, once, and overpowering him with questions about 
home, and with school anecdotes. We stopped a few moments 
afterwards to water the horses, and on resuming our route, a 
turn of the road brought us in sight of a neat country seat. [ 
could just distinguish the forms of a lady and two young girls in 
the portico, and I saw my little comrades, with Bantam, Carlo. 
and old John, trooping along the carriage road. I leaned out of 
the coach window, in hopes of witnessing the happy meeting, 
but a grove of trees shut it from my sight.

Lusson 61 — Maxine 4 Goop ARGUMENT 
1. Steps in an Argument or Debate. 
You have already been made familiar with narration, 
description, and explanation. Still another kind of speaking 
or writing is called argument. 
In argument we try to convince others that a certain 
statement is true, or that it is false. If we speak or write 
upon the subject, “The Advantages of Living in the Coun- 
try,” we support our opinion by argument; that is, we 
present facts to prove that our opinion is correct. 
When two or more speakers support opposite sides of a 
question, the argument is called a debate. The subject of 
the argument, which should be clearly stated, is called the 
proposition. This may be expressed in the form of a ques- 
tion, as, “Is it Better to Live in the Country or in the 
City?” Or it may be stated in the form of a resolution, as 
“Resolved, That it is Better to Live in the Country than in 
the City.” 
In presenting an argument in a debate, we first make 
certain statements to explain the proposition and to show 
what we intend to prove. This part of the debate is called 
the introduction. , 
After the introduction we make further statements to 
convince others that our side of the proposition is the correct 
one. These statements must not be mere opinions of our 
own, but must be based upon facts that will be acknowl- 
edged as true, or that can be proved to be true. This 
part of the debate is called the proof. 
After the proof, we usually re-state the main points of 
our introduction and proof, to show that we have proved 
our proposition. ‘ 
_ Before attempting to argue a proposition, it is very 
important to make an outline.

CHAPTER FIVE 
  Lesson 67 — LireraTuRE 
1, Reading. 
Heiwr’s Mounrarn Home 
Heidi lived with her grandfather in a hut near the top of a 
great mountain in Switzerland. On stormy days the wind 
howled around the little house and it seemed as if it must be 
blown down into the valley. On pleasant days the top of the 
mountain was flooded with sunshine, and the hut was then a 
beautiful place in which to live. 
Behind the hut were three old fir trees with long thick 
branches, and beyond these rose a wall of mountain. The lower 
slopes were overgrown with beautiful grasses and wild flowers, 
and above these were stony heights, covered only with scrub and 
leading gradually up to the bare, rocky summit. 
Every morning during the summer, Heidi’s little friend, Peter, 
came with the goats, and the two children climbed up to the 
high meadows. When autumn came and the wind blew louder 
and colder, the grandfather would sometimes say, “You must 
* stay at home today, Heidi; a sudden gust of wind might blow 
you over the rocks, down into the valley.” 
Whether Heidi was out with Peter, or at home with her 
grandfather, she was always happy,.for she always found some- 
thing to interest her. The thing which attracted her most, on 
the days when the wind kept her at home, was the roaring of 
the fir trees. She would stand under them and look up, unable 
to tear herself away, while they bowed and swayed and roared 
as the wind rushed through them. 
One night there was a heavy fall of snow. . The next morning 
the whole mountain was white, and the flakes were still falling, 
224
-P-A-G-E-238
PART TWO 225 
Heidi stood at the little window watching the snow come down, 
and wondering if it would cover the hut all over. “What fun 
that would be!” she thought. By the next morning, however, 
the flakes had ceased to fall and the grandfather was able to 
go out and shovel away the snow that had piled up around 
the hut. 
One afternoon, a few days later, as Heidi and her grandfather 
sat in front of the fire, there was a great stamping at the door, 
and in came Peter. He was white with snow, but his face 
beamed with pleasure at seeing his friends again. Soon he was 
seated near the fire and Heidi was asking him questions faster 
than he could answer them. 
The grandfather listened with an amused smile to the little 
girl’s questions about the school, which she was told Peter must 
attend, now that winter had come. Then the old man said, “I 
think Peter needs refreshment. He must have supper with us.” 
Peter opened his eyes very wide when he saw what a large 
piece of dried meat the grandfather gave him on his thick slice of 
bread. Peter’s mother was very poor and she could not give him 
meat. At home he seldom had anything more than black bread 
to eat, and he wished he could have supper with Heidi every day. 
When the pleasant meal was over, Peter started for home. As 
he was leaving, he turned and said, “I shall come again next 
Sunday. My grandmother says she hopes that some day Heidi 
will come to see her.” 
Heidi was surprised to hear that anyone wanted to see her. 
The first thing she said to her grandfather the next day was, “I 
must go down to see Peter’s grandmother today; she will expect 
me.” 
“The snow is too deep and soft,” answered her grandfather, 
hoping that Heidi would soon forget what Peter had said. But 
Geidi thought she must go because the grandmother had asked 
her to come. 
The next morning she spoke of it again. “May I go today, 
grandfather? I know Peter’s grandmother expects me!” 
“No, Heidi,” answered her grandfather, “the snow is still too 
deep and soft.”

226 GOOD ENGLISH 
On the fourth day the vast field of snow was. like ice. As 
Heidi sat at dinner with the bright sun shining in upon her, she 
said again, “I must go down to see Peter's grandmother today; 
I have kept ber waiting too long.” 
Her grandfather smiled but said nothing. After dinner he 
brought down from the hayloft a large, thick bag. “Come with 
me, Heidi,” he said, and the child ran joyfully after him out 
upon the hard, shining snow. 
The old trees were standing quite silent now. They looked so 
beautiful, as they sparkled and glittered in the sunshine, that 
Heidi jumped for joy. “Come here, Grandfather, come here!’* 
she cried. “The fir trees are all silver and gold!” _ 
The grandfather had gone into the shed and now came out 
dragging a large sled, to the side of which a pole was fastened. 
After Heidi had taken him around the fir trees to see their 
beauty from all sides, he sat down on the sled and lifted the 
child upon his lap. He wrapped her snugly in the bag, and held 
her with his left arm. In his right hand he firmly grasped the 
big pole which was to steer their course. A push with his feet. 
started the sled. Down the mountain they shot so swiftly that 
Heidi thought they were flying, and shouted aloud in her delight. 
Soon they found themselves at Peter’s home. The old man 
lifted Heidi out of the bag. “There you are, little girl!” he said. 
“Now: run in and see Peter’s grandmother.”

this discussion. 
Remember that Heidi lived far fram street cars and 
railroads. She could not go to parks or picture shows. She 
could not buy candy and ice cream, for two reasons — 
there was no place to buy them, and she had no money 
to spend. She had no toys, except such as she herself 
made or her grandfather made for her. Her clothing was 
warm, but it was not pretty. She had no girl playmates, 
for she was the only little girl who lived up on the mountain.

1. Ability to Read. 
You were taught in Lesson 23 that some pieces of 
literature must be read thoughtfully in order to gain the 
author’s meaning. Such reading cannot be’ done rapidly. 
Howeyer, in much of what we read the thought can be 
easily grasped and the reading can be done rapidly. In 
such cases, we read mainly for the story, holding in mind 
the various incidents as the plot unfolds. 
This ability to gain information rapidly from the printed 
page will be of great value to you throughout life. Do you 
take more time to read a page than is necessary? Do you 
read one word and then another, or have you trained your 
eyes to pass so quickly over a line that you seem to see it 
all at a glance? Have you trained your eyes and mind to 
work together? No progress can be made by the eyes alone, 
while the mind wanders. As the eyes pass over the printed
-P-A-G-E-249

words, your mind should be centered upon the thought of 
the sentence. 
To be able to tell simply and clearly the substance of 
what you have read is one proof that you have read with 
understanding. Do not depend solely on the exercises given 
in this book for developing the power to.grasp rapidly the 
substance of a paragraph or a page. If you have a page 
of history to-learn, time yourself, reading as rapidly as 
possible, but not so hurriedly as to lose the thought. Close 
the book, think over what you have read, and'see if you 
can tell the important points. Repeat this exercise until 
you are able to give accurately the substance of what you 
have read. 
The ‘purpose of noting the time spent in reading a page 
is to help you break up bad habits that you may have formed. 
If you time yourself, you will not sit staring at words while 
your mind is on something else, nor will you gaze around the 
room or out of the window. 
2. Story Telling. 
Time yourself as you read silently the following story. 
Tell the substance of the story; then read it again, silently, 
timing yourself as before. Retell the story, trying to tell 
it more accurately than you did the first time. 
Tuer Foorisn Torroiss 
A tortoise, having grown tired of the place in which he had 
lived for. many years, asked two wild geese if they would carry 
him to a new home. 
“We are willing to carry you,” said the geese, “but you must 
tell us how to do it.” : 
“Tf you will each take an end of this stick, I will hold on to 
the middle by my mouth,” said the tortoise. 
“Can you keep your mouth closed while we fly?” asked the 
geese. “‘Remember, if you try to talk, you will surely fall.”
-P-A-G-E-250
PART TWO 237 
When the tortoise assured them that he would not open his 
mouth, the geese consented to carry him. In a moment they all 
rose in the air, and the strong wings of the geese bore them 
easily along. 
Some people working in the fields saw the strange sight and 
called to each other in surprise. 
“The tortoise will surely fall,” they said. “He cannot keep 
his mouth closed on that stick.” 
This made the tortoise so angry that he opened his mouth to 
say, “I can keep my mouth closed!” Before he could say the 
words, however, he fell to the ground.

Lesson 79 — Cuass Composition 
Be prepared to take part with other members of the class 
in telling the story of the foolish tortoise. Dictate the 
sentences to your teacher so that she may write them on 
the board. . The following suggestions will help you: 
Of what should we tell in the first paragraph? 
Give a good opening sentence. Where should this 
sentence begin? What capital letter is needed in it? 
What punctuation mark should be placed at the end? 
Is another sentence needed in this paragraph? If so, 
give it. Does this sentence follow naturally after the one 
given before? 
In dialogue, the speech of each of the characters forms 
@ separate paragraph. (See the second, third, and fourth 
paragraphs of the story.) 
Suggest a topic for the second paragraph. Does this 
topic seem to belong immediately after the first? Give 
a good opening sentence. Where should this sentence 
begin? What capital letter is needed? What punctuation 
marks are needed? 
Continue to form paragraphs in this way until the 
story is complete.

1, Reading. 
A Cowsoy Race 
A pattering rush like the rattle of hail 
‘When the storm-king’s wild coursers are out on the trail, 
- A long roll of hoofs—and the earth is a drum! 
The centaurs! See! Over the prairies they come! 
A rollicking, clattering, battering beat; 
A rhythmical thunder of galloping feet; 
A swift-swirling dust-cloud—a mad hurricane 
Of swarthy, grim faces and tossing, black mane. 
Hurrah! In the face of the steeds of the sun 
The gauntlet is flung and the race is begun! 
| J.C. Davis.

How many single words, or groups of words, can you 
find that describe the race? Which ones do you think de-

Lesson 84 — LITERATURE 
A Lecenp or Brecunz 
Girt round with rugged mountains 
The fair Lake Constance lies; 
In her blue heart reflected 
Shine back the starry skies; 
And, watching each white cloudlet 
Float silently and slow, 
You think a piece of Heaven 
Lies on our earth below! 
Midnight is there; and Silence, 
Enthroned in Heaven, looks down 
Upon her own calm mirror, 
Upon a sleeping town; 
For Bregenz, that quaint city 
Upon the Tyrol shore, 
Has stood above Lake Constance 
A thousand years and more. 
Her battlements and towers, 
From off their rocky steep, 
Have cast their trembling shadow 
For ages on the deep: 
Mountain and lake and valley, 
A sacred legend know, 
Of how the town was saved, one night, 
Three hundred years ago. 
243
-P-A-G-E-257
2A4 GOOD ENGLISH 
Far from her home and kindred, 
A Tyrol maid had fled, 
To serve in the Swiss valleys, 
And toil for daily bread; 
And every year that fleeted 
So silently and fast, 
Seemed to bear farther from her 
The memory of the past. 
She served kind, gentle masters, 
Nor asked for rest or change; 
Her friends seemed no more new ones, 
Their speech seemed no more strange; 
And when she led her cattle 
To pasture every day, 
She ceased to look and wonder 
On which side Bregenz lay. 
(One day she heard that an army was preparing to capture 
Bregenz. Then she realized her heart was still in her old home.) 
Nothing she heard around her 
(Though shouts rang forth again), 
Gone were the green Swiss valleys, 
The pasture, and the plain; 
Before her eyes one vision, 
And in her heart one ery, 
That said, “Go forth, save Bregenz, 
And then, if need be, die!” 
(Mounted on a swift horse, she reached Bregenz as the bells 
rang for midnight, and warned the city of its danger.) 
Bregenz is saved! Ere daylight 
Her battlements are manned; 
Defiance greets the army 
That marches on the land.
-P-A-G-E-258
PART TWO “ 245 
And if to deeds heroic 
Should endless fame be paid, 
Bregenz does well to honor 
The noble Tyrol maid. 
Three hundred years are vanished, 
And yet upon the hill 
An old stone gateway rises, 
To do her honor still. 
And there, when Bregenz women 
Sit spinning in the shade, 
They see in quaint old carving 
The charger and the maid. 
And when, to guard old Bregenz, 
By gateway, street, and tower, 
The warder paces all night long 
And calls each passing hour; 
“Nine,” “ten,” “eleven,” he cries aloud, 
And then (O crown of Fame!) 
When midnight pauses in the skies, 
He calls the maiden’s name. 
— Adelaide Procter.

1. Reading: 
Pavut Reverr’s Ripe 
Listen, my children, and you shall hear 
Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere, 
On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five: 
Hardly a man is now alive 
Who remembers that famous day and year. 
He said to his friend: “If the British march 
By land or sea from the town tonight, 
Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry-arch 
Of the North Church tower, as a signal-light,— 
One if by land, and two if by sea; 
And I on the opposite shore will be, 
Ready to ride and spread the alarm 
Through every Middlesex village and farm, 
For the country-folk to be up and to arm.” 
Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride, 
Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride, 
On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere. 
Now he patted his horse’s side, 
Now gazed at the landscape far and near, 
Then impetuous stamped the earth, 
And turned and tightened his saddle-girth; 
But mostly he watched with eager search 
The belfry-tower of the old North Church, 
- As it rose above the graves on the hill, 
Lonely, and spectral, and sombre, and still.
-P-A-G-E-262
PART TWO 249 
And lo! as he looks, on the belfry’s height, 
A glimmer, and then a gleam of light! 
He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns, 
But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight 
A second lamp in the belfry burns! 
A hurry of hoofs in a village street, 
A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark, 
And beneath, from the pebbles, in passing, a spark 
Struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet: 
That was all! And yet, through the gloom and the light, 
The fate of a nation was riding that night; 
And the spark struck out by that steed in his flight, 
Kindled the land into flame with its heat. 
So through the night rode Paul Revere; 
And so through the night went his cry of alarm 
To every Middlesex village and farm,— 
A ery of defiance and not of fear, 
A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door, 
And a word that shall echo forevermore! 
For, borne on the night-wind of the past, 
Through all our history, to the last, 
In the hour of darkness and peril and need, 
The people will waken and listen to hear 
The hurrying hoof-beats of that steed, 
And the midnight message of Paul Revere. 
— Henry W. Longfellow.

Tue Fuac or Our Country 
There is the national flag. He must be cold indeed who can 
look upon its folds, rippling in the breeze, without pride of 
country. If he be in a foreign land, the flag is companionship 
and country itself, with all its endearments. Its highest beauty 
is in what it symbolizes. It is because it represents all, that all 
gaze at it with delight and reverence. 
It is a piece of bunting lifted in the air; but it speaks sub- 
limely, and every part has a voice. Its stripes of alternate red 
and white proclaim the original union of thirteen states to 
maintain the Declaration of Independence. Its stars of white on 
a field of blue proclaim that union of states constituting our 
national constellation, which receives a new star with every new 
state. The two together signify union past and present. 
The very colors have a language which was officially recognized 
by our fathers. White is for purity, red for valor, blue for justice; 
and all together, bunting, stripes, stars, and colors, blazing in the 
sky, make the flag of our country to be cherished by all our hearts, 
to be upheld by all . o be upnere OY our hands — Charles Sumner.

Tre DEFENSE OF THE ALAMO 
Santa Anna came storming, as a storm might come; 
There was rumble of cannon; there was rattle of blade; 
There was cavalry, infantry, bugle, and drum— 
Full seven thousand in pomp and parade. 
The chivalry, flower of Mexico; , 
And a gaunt two hundred in the Alamo! 
And thirty lay sick, and some were shot through; 
For the siege had been bitter, and bloody, and long. 
“Surrender, or die!”—“Men, what will you do?’ 
And Travis, great Travis, drew sword, quick and strong; 
Drew a line at his feet... . “Will you come? Will you go? 
I die with my wounded, in the Alamo,” 
The Bowie gasped, “Lead me over that line!” 
Then Crockett, one hand to the sick, one hand to his gun, 
Crossed with him; then never a word or a sign 
Till all, sick or well, all, all save one, 
One man, Then a woman stepped, praying, and slow 
Across, to die at her post in the Alamo. 
Then that one coward fled, in the night, in that night 
When all men silently prayed and thought 
Of home, of tomorrow, of God and the right,

Till dawn; and with dawn came Travis’s cannon-shot, 
In answer to insolent Mexico, 
From the old bell tower of the Alamo. 
Then came Santa Anna, a erescent of flame! 
Then the red escalade; then the fight hand to hand; 
Such an unequal fight as never had name 
Since the Persian hordes butchered that doomed Spartan band. 
All day—all day and all night; and the morning—so slow, 
Through the battle smoke mantling the Alamo. 
Now silence! Such silence! Two thousand lay dead 
In a crescent outside! And within? Not a breath 
Save the gasp of a woman, with gory gashed head, 
All alone, all alone there, waiting for death; 
And she but a nurse. Yet when shall we know 
Another like this of the Alamo? 
Shout “Victory, victory, victory, ho!” 
I say ’tis not always to the hosts that win! 
I say that the victory, high or low, 
Is given the hero who grapples with sin, 
Or legion or single; just asking to know 
When duty fronts death in his Alamo. 
—Joaquin Miller. 
2, Study of the Poem. 
Santa Anna was the Mexican general who, in 1836, at- 
tacked the Alamo. This was a former church which had 
been made into a fort. The commander of the Texans, 
Colonel W. B. Travis, held out against the Mexicans until 
he and all except one of his men were killed. 
Can you picture the coming of the Mexican army?

Not one came near, although the crane knew there were many in 
the pond. At last he cried, “Oh, little fish! If you knew what is 
going to happen, you would come to me so that I could save 
you. The fishermen are coming to destroy everything that lives 
in this pond.”

“O, good crane, kind crane, please take us!”’ cried some of 
the fish. 
“Have we any reason to trust the promises of this crane?” 
asked a wise fish. “Has he not eaten our friends day after day?” 
The foolish fish would not listen, but crowded around the 
crane, each anxious to be the first saved. The crane lifted a fish 
from the water, carried him behind a rock, and swallowed him. 
One after another the fish were carried away from the pool and 
eaten by the crane. 
At last. the wise fish was alone in the pool. 
“Come, little fish,” said the crane, “let me take you to your 
friends.”’ 
“Bring back one of my friends, so that I may ask him how 
he enjoyed the journey,” said the wise fish. “If you cannot do

And green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled,

Cocking tails and pricking whiskers,

Followed the Piper for their lives. 
From street to street he piped advancing, 
And step for step they followed dancing, 
Until they came to the river Weser; 
Wherein all plunged and perished! 
Save one who, stout as Julius Caesar, 
Swam across and lived to carry . 
(As he, the manuscript he cherished) 
To Rat-land homie his commentary: 
Which was, “At the first shrill notes of the pipe, 
I heard a sound as of scraping tripe, - 
And putting apples, wondrous ripe, 
Into a cider-press’s gripe; 
And a moving away of pickle-tub-boards, 
And a leaving ajar of conserve-cupboards, 
And a drawing the corks of train-oil-flasks, 
And a breaking the hoops of butter-casks; 
And it seemed as if a voice 
(Sweeter far than by harp or by psaltery 
Is breathed) called out, ‘Oh rats, rejoice! 
The world is grown to one vast drysaltery! 
So munch on, crunch on, take your nuncheon, 
Breakfast, supper, dinner, luncheon!’ 
And just as a bulky sugar-puncheon, 
All ready staved, like a great sun shone 
Glorious, scarce an inch before me, 
Just as methought it said, ‘Come, bore me!’ 
I found the Weser rolling o’er me.”

Consult with carpenters and builders, 
And leave in our town not even a trace 
Of. the rats!”— when suddenly, up the face 
Of the Piper perked in the market-place, 
With a, “First, if you please, my thousand guilders!’” 
A thousand guilders! The Mayor looked blue; 
So did the Corporation too. 
For council dinners made rare havoc 
With Claret, Moselle, Vin-de-Grave, Hock; 
And half the money would replenish 
Their cellar’s biggest butt with Rhenish. 
To pay this sum to a wandering fellow 
With a gypsy coat of red and yellow! 
“Beside,” quoth the Mayor, with a knowing wink, 
“Our business was done at the river’s brink; 
We saw with our eyes the vermin sink, 
And what’s dead can’t come to life, I think. 
So, friend, we’re not the folks to shrink 
From the duty of giving you something for drink, 
And a matter of money to put in your poke; 
But, as for the guilders, what we spoke 
Of them, as you very well know, was in joke. 
Beside, our losses have made us thrifty. 
A thousand guilders! Come, take fifty!” 
The Piper’s face fell, and he cried, 
“No trifling! I can’t wait, beside! 
I’ve promised to visit by dinner time 
Bagdat, and accept the prime 
Of the head-cook’s pottage, all he’s rich in, 
For having left, in the Caliph’s kitchen, 
Of a nest of scorpions no survivor.

And folks who put me in a passion 
May find me pipe after another fashion.” 
“How?” cried the mayor, “d’ye think I brook 
Being worse treated than a cook? 
Insulted by a lazy ribald 
‘With idle pipe and vesture piebald? 
You threaten us, fellow? Do your worst, 
Blow your pipe there till you burst.” 
Til 
Once more he stept into the street, 
And to his lips again 
Laid his long pipe of smooth, straight cane; 
And ere he blew three notes (such sweet 
Soft notes as yet musician’s cunning 
Never gave the enraptured air) 
There was a rustling that seemed like a bustling 
Of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling; 
Small feet were pattering, wooden shoes clattering, 
Little hands clapping and little tongues chattering, 
And, like fowls in a farmyard when barley is scattering, 
Out came the children running. 
All the little boys and girls, 
With rosy cheeks and flaxen curls, 
And sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls, 
Tripping and skipping, ran merrily after 
The wonderful music with shouting and laughter. 
The Mayor was dumb, and the Council stood 
As if they were changed into blocks of wood, 
. Unable to move a step, or cry 
To the children merrily skipping by, 
And could only follow with the eye

When, lo, as they reached the mountain-side, 
A wondrous portal opened wide, 
As if a cavern was suddenly hollowed; 
And the Piper advanced and the children ‘followed, 
And when all were in to the very last, 
The door in the mountain-side shut fast. 
Did I say, all? No! One was lame, 
And could not dance the whole of the way; 
And in after years, if you would blame 
His sadness, he was used to say,— 
“Tt’s dull in our town since my playmates left! 
I can’t forget that I’m bereft 
Of all the pleasant sights they see, 
Which the Piper also promised me. 
For he led us, he said, to a joyous land;~ 
Joining the town and just at hand, 
Where waters gushed and fruit-trees grew, 
And flowers put forth a fairer hue, 
And everything was strange and new; 
The sparrows were brighter than peacocks here, 
And their dogs outran our fallow deer, ’ 
And honey-bees had lost their stings, 
And horses were born with eagles’ wings; 
“And just as I became assured 
My lame foot would be speedily cured, 
The music stopped and I stood still, 
And found myself outside the hill, 
Left alone against my will, 
To go now limping as before, 
‘And never hear of that country more!” 
— Robert Browning.

There will not be a drop of rain the whole of the livelong day, 
And I’m to be Queen o’ the May, mother, I’m to be ‘Queen oO

All the valley, mother, ‘ill be fresh and green and still,

And the rivulet in the flowery dale ’ill merrily glance and play, 
For I’m to be Queen o’ the May, mother, I’m to be Queen 0’

Tue Dearu or StonewaLu JacKSon 
The greatest general of the South was Lee, and ‘his greatest 
lieutenant was Jackson. Stonewall Jackson was a man of intense 
religious conviction, who carried into every thought and deed of 
his daily life the precepts of the faith he cherished. He was a 
tender and loving husband and father, kind-hearted and gentle 
to all with whom he was brought in contact; yet in the times that 
tried men’s souls, he proved not only a commander of genius, but 
a fighter of iron will and temper, who joyed in the battle, and 
always showed at his best when the danger was greatest. Few 
generals as great as Lee have ever had as great a lieutenant as 
Jackson.
-P-A-G-E-307
294 GOOD ENGLISH 
In the spring of 1863 Hooker had command of the Army of 
the Potomac. He had under him 120,000 men when, toward 
the end of April, he prepared to attack Lee’s army, which was but - 
half as strong. Lee fully realized his danger, and saw that his 
only chance was, first to beat back Hooker, and then to turn and 
overwhelm Sedgwick, who was in his rear. He consulted with 
Jackson, and Jackson begged to be allowed to make. one of his 
favorite flank attacks upon the Union army; attacks which could 
have been successfully delivered only by a skilled and resolute 
general, and by troops equally able to march and to fight. Lee 
consented, and Jackson at once made off. 
The Eleventh Corps had not the slightest idea that it was 
about to be assailed. The men were not even in line. Many of 
them had stacked their muskets and were lounging about, some 
playing cards, others eooking supper. 
While they were thus utterly unprepared, Jackson’s gray-clad 
veterans pushed straight through the forest and rushed fiercely to 
the attack. With one fierce rush Jackson’s men swept over the 
Union lines, and at a blow the Eleventh Corps became a horde of 
panic-stricken fugitives. Some of the regiments resisted for a 
few moments, and then they too were carried away in the flight. 
For a while it seemed as if the whole army would be swept off; 
but Hooker and his subordinates exerted every effort to restore 
order. It was imperative to gain time so that the untouched 
portions of the army could form across the line of the Confederate 
advance. 
Keenan’s.regiment of Pennsylvania cavalry, but four hundred 
sabers strong, was accordingly sent full against the front of the 
ten thousand victorious Confederates. 
Keenan himself fell, pierced by bayonets, and the charge was 
repulsed at once; but a few priceless moments had been saved, 
and Pleasanton had been given time to post twenty-two guns, 
loaded with canister, where they would bear upon the enemy. 
The Confederates advanced in a dense mass, yelling and cheer- 
ing, and the discharge of the guns fairly blew them back across 
the works they had just taken. Again they charged, and again 
were driven back; and when the battle once began the Union 
reenforcements had arrived.
-P-A-G-E-308
PART TWO 295 
It was about this time that Jackson himself was mortally 
wounded. He had been leading and urging on the advance of his 
men, cheering them with voice and gesture, his pale face flushed 
with joy and excitement, while from time to time as he sat on 
his horse he took off his hat and, looking upward, thanked Heaven 
for the victory it had vouchsafed him. As darkness drew near 
he was in the front, where friend and foe were mingled in almost 
inextricable confusion. He and his staff were fired at by the 
Union troops, and, as they turned, were fired at again, through 
a mistake, by the Confederates behind them. Jackson fell, 
struck in several places. He was put in a litter and carried back; 
but he never lost consciousness and when one of his generals com- 
plained of the terrible effect of the Union cannonade he answered: 
“You must hold your ground.” 
For several days he lingered, hearing how Lee beat Hooker, in 
detail, and forced him back across the river. Then the old warrior 
died. At the end his mind wandered, and he thought he was 
again commanding in battle, and his last words were: 
“Let us cross over the river and rest in the shade.” 
Thus perished Stonewall Jackson, one of the ablest of soldiers 
and one of the most upright of men, in the last of his many triumphs. 
—Theodore Roosevelt.

Jackson’s relation to him? . 
Roosevelt describes above the Battle of the Wilderness, 
fought in April, 1863, in which Stonewall Jackson was 
mortally wounded. He died on May 10, 1863, a day which

Memorial Day. Is the time appropriate to the season

1. Reading. 
Sizras Marner anp Lirrie Epp 
Silas Marner’s determination to keep the child was matter 
of hardly less surprise and talk in the village than the robbery 
of his money. That softening of feeling toward him which dated 
from his misfortune was now accompanied with a more active 
sympathy, especially amongst the women. 
Thought and feeling were so confused within him, that if 
he had tried to give them utterance, he could only have said that 
the child was come instead of the gold —that the gold had 
turned into the child. As the weeks grew to months, the child 
created fresh links between his life and the lives from which he 
had hitherto shrunk. 
Unlike the gold which needed nothing and must be wor- 
shiped in close-locked solitude — which was hidden away from 
the daylight, was deaf to the song of birds, and started to no 
human tones — Eppie was.a creature of endless claims, seeking 
and loving sunshine, making trial of everything, with trust in 
new joy, and stirring the human kindness in all eyes that looked 
on her. The gold had asked that he should sit weaving longer 
and longer, deafened and blinded more and more to all things 
except the monotony of his loom, but Eppie called him away 
from his weaving, reawakening his senses with her fresh life and 
warming him into joy because she had joy. 
By the time Eppie was three years old, she developed a fine 
capacity for mischief, and for devising ingenious ways of being 
troublesome, which found much exercise, not only for Silas’s 
300

PART TWO 301 
patience, but for his watchfulness and penetration. He had 
wisely chosen a broad strip of linen as a means of fastening 
her to his loom when he was busy: it made a broad belt round 
her waist, and was long enough to allow of her reaching the bed 
and sitting down on it, but not long enough for her to attempt 
any dangerous climbing. One bright summer’s morning Silas 
had been more engrossed than usual in “setting up” a new piece 
of work, an occasion on which his scissors were in requisition. 
Silas had seated himself at his loom, and the noise of weaving 
had begun; but he’had left his scissors on a ledge which Eppie’s 
arm was long enough to reach; and now, like a small mouse, 
watching her opportunity, she stole quietly from her corner, 
secured the scissors, and toddled to the bed again. 
She had a distinct intention as to the use of the scissors; 
and having cut the linen strip in a jagged but effectual manner, 
in two minutes she had run out at the open door where the 
sunshine was inviting her, while poor Silas believed her to be a 
better child than usual. It was not until he happened to need 
his scissors that the terrible fact burst upon him; Eppie had run 
out by herself — had perhaps fallen into the Stone-pit. 
Silas, shaken by the worst fear that could have befallen him, 
rushed out, calling “Eppie!” and ran eagerly about the unen- 
closed space, exploring the dry cavities into which she might 
have fallen, and then gazing with questioning dread at the 
smooth surface of the water. . The cold drops stood on his brow. 
How jong had she been out? There was one hope — that she 
had crept through the stile and got into the felds, where he 
habitually took her to stroll. 
The meadow was searched in ‘vain; and he got over the stile 
into the next field, looking with dying hope toward a small pond 
which was now reduced to its summer shallowness, so as to 
leave a wide margin of good adhesive mud. Here, however, 
sat Eppie, discoursing cheerfully to her own small boot, which 
she was using as a bucket to convey the water into a deep hoof-. 
mark, while her little naked foot was planted comfortably on a 
cushion of olive-green mud.

2. Study of Story. 
Silas Marner was a hard-working linen weaver, living 
alone as a hermit, who had grown to care for nothing but 
money. One day his gold, which he had hidden under the 
floor of his kitchen, was stolen. Soon after this a little girl 
who had lost her way toddled into the cottage. Silas 
adopted her, as her parents did not appear. In caring for 
her, the weaver found a new interest in life. 
Mention some characteristics of the gold and its effect 
upon Silas Marner. : 
Make a list of the qualities in Eppie which the author 
contrasts with the characteristics of the gold.

Tux Goon Cauipax 
Once upon: a time there lived a caliph who was very generous 
and merciful. It was his habit to disguise himself and waliz 
through the streets of his capital at night, in order to discover 
if all was well with his people. 
One night he set out, accompanied by one of his officers. As 
he walked through a dark street he heard a woman ery, “TI hope 
the caliph may some day suffer as I suffer!” Turning around, he 
saw a woman seated on the ground with four little children 
asleep near her. 
When he questioned the woman, he learned that she had 
lately come to the city and, being unable to pay for shelter, was 
forced to remain in the street. Her children, worn out with 
hunger, had eried themselves to sleep. 
“But, my poor woman, why do you blame the caliph?” 
asked the disguised ruler. “How can you expect him to know 
of your distress?” 
“Ts he not the father of his people?” asked the woman. 
“Who will care for us if he does not?” 
The' good caliph hurried to a shop and bought bread and 
meat. His officer wished to carry the heavy bag which con- 
tained the food, but the caliph insisted that he must carry it, as 
his punishment for failing to provide lodgings for poor travelers, 
The’ woman and her children had a good meal, and then the 
caliph led them to comfortable lodgings. The poor woman 
thanked him for his help, and said that she would pray God to 
bless this stranger who was so much kinder than the caliph.

SuppLeMENTARY Supsects ror Orat AND WRITTEN 
ComposITION 
The following subjects for oral and written composition, 
grouped according to theme, provide helpful material to 
supplement the lessons given in the text, or for use in the 
place of certain lessons in the book. 
For example, page 319 may be used instead of Lessons 
96 and 97 (pages 96 and 97), which introduce the 
subject of health, or they may well follow Lessons 96 
and 97 as supplementary lessons. In some cases it may 
be found desirable to discuss a group of several connected 
topics as one lesson. These topics may be made the basis 
of oral discussion one day and followed the next day by 
written work. , 
The arrangement of these subjects into two groups— 
Part One and Part Two—is flexible. Teachers should 
feel free to assign subjects in either part, when such topies 
have not already been used in the preceding year. 
The plan for using these Supplementary Theme Sub- 
jects is flexible, and the teacher should feel free to draw 
upon them whenever occasion arises,

Somepopy’s MotHer* 
(Author Unknown) 
The woman was old, and ragged, and gray, 
And bent with the chill of the winter’s day. 
The street was wet with the recent snow, 
And the woman’s feet were aged and slow. 
She stood at the crossing and waited long 
Alone, uncared for, amid the throng 
Of human beings who passed her by, 
Nor heeded the glance of her anxious eye. 
Down the street with laughter and shout, 
Glad in the freedom of “school let out,” 
Came the boys like a flock of sheep, 
Hailing the snow piled white and deep. 
Past the woman so old and gray, 
Hastened the children on their way, 
Nor offered a helping hand to her, 
So meek, so timid, afraid to stir, 
Lest the carriage wheels or the horses’ feet 
Should crowd her down in the slippery street. 
*From Harper’s Weekly. Copyright, 1878, by Harper & Brothers,

APPENDIX 323 
At last came one of the merry troop, 
The gayest laddie of all the group; 
He paused beside her and whispered low, 
“Pll help you across if you wish to go.” 
Her aged hand on his strong young arm 
She placed, and so, without hurt or harm, 
He guided her trembling feet along, 
Prond that his own were firm and strong. 
Then back again to his friends he went, 
His young heart happy and well content. 
“She’s somebody’s mother, boys, you know, 
For all she’s aged and poor and slow; 
“And I hope some fellow will lend a hand 
To help my mother, you understand, 
If ever she’s poor, and old, and gray, 
‘When her own dear boy is far away.” 
‘And “somebody’s mother” bowed low her head, 
In her home that night, and the prayer she said, 
Was, “God be kind to the noble boy, . 
Who is somebody’s son and pride dnd joy.”

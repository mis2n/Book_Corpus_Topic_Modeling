HABIT 
So, then! Wilt use me asa garment? Well, 
’Tis man’s high impudence to think he may; But I— who am as old as Heav'n and Hell — Tam not lightly to be cast away. 
Wilt run a race? Then I will run with thee, 
And stay thy steps or speed thee to the goal; Wilt dare a fight? Then, of a certainty, 
TN aid thy foeman, or sustain thy soul. 
Lo, at thy marriage feast, upon one hand Face of the bride, and on the other — mine! Lo, at thy couch of sickness close I stand, 
And taint the cup, or make it more benign! 
Yea—hark! The very son thou hast begot One day doth give thee certain sign and ery; Hold thou thy peace — frighted or frighted not — That look, that sign, that presence — it is I!

PREFACE 
Tas book had its origin in an investigation, made several 
years ago, of the formative value of Latin and Greek. 
That inquiry resulted in the conviction that training in 
these languages owed its chief disciplinary merit to the 
habits engendered in connection with attention, rapid inter- 
pretation, classification, and contemplation of life from 
another’s point of view. The absolute lack, however, of 
any systematic scheme of securing any particular habit 
was startlingly emphasized. 
Subsequently, the writer made studies concerning various 
other phases of educational procedure. In each case the 
conclusion was reached that in none of the aspects of edu- 
cation investigated was there a scientifically established 
method of securing the habits sought. In the end it became 
evident that here is an extensive subdivision of methodology, 
the general principles of which have not been formulated, 
though educators past and present have united in insisting 
upon the fundamental importance of good habits. 
The design of this book is twofold: first, to present in 
scientific form the relation of habit to education; and 
secondly, to treat the subject of habit-formation in a way 
that will render practical assistance to the teacher, the 
Supervisor, the parent, and the clergyman. Their problem 
is not merely to impart ideas, but even more to form habits; 
for habit plays an essential part in the acquisition of knowl- 
edge as well as in the development of ability to contribute 
to the general welfare. vil

   A formulation of method is needed in which this 
position of habit is duly recognized. The fact that th 
is a fundamental tissue of habits permeating ideational 
processes has been practically ignored in methods of ins 
tion, while in methods of guidance or training the proble: 
of habit-formation has been overshadowed by specific pr 
Jems of mere management and control. It is clear, how 
ever, to the student of habit that thorough acquaintan 
with subject-matter -— the aim of instruction — implies som 
what of habit and much of understanding, while the 
havior sought in school management should imply somé 
understanding and much habit. It remains to elaboral 
the mode of selecting habits, the conditions of making an 
breaking them, the vital phases of their formation, thei 
relation to subject-matter and discipline, and the means ol 
overcoming hindrances. These, then, are salient features 
of the present undertaking. 
The real importance of general principles for the main, 
tenance of discipline and for making effective all varieties 
of drill is too evident to need elaboration. Moreover, 4 
recognition of these principles should simplify the problem| 
of. special method and school discipline, since each subject 
or form of training must to some degree at least contribute to} 
the advantage of others. 
From the practical side the need of a methodology of 
habit has been of late strongly evidenced. In two recent 
meetings of the National Education Association especial 
emphasis was laid on the drill side of education. But at 
abundance of drill or repetition does not necessarily produce 
the habits, intellectual or moral, which are desired. Such 
exercises conducted unskillfully often defeat themselves 
A systematic and practical study of the subject should be 
helpful to superintendents and teachers alike.

Chapters ITI, IV, V, VI, XI, and XIV may be substituted

breaking, however, Chapter XI must be read.

HABIT-FORMATION 
CHAPTER I 
Tur TEACHER’S PROBLEM 
“Effective power in action is the true end of education.” 
— Etior. 
1. Nature of education. — Education is a broad term. 
It involves growth and, so long as this leads to greater effi- 
ciency, growth of any kind. It is not restricted to the 
sort of growth that takes place in the schoolroom or 
with the aid of the tutor, — the library, the church, the 
street, the theater, the symphony are alike.educative. 
The process by which a person gradually falls into the 
ruts of habit and fossilization is not necessarily an educa- 
tive process. Education implies increased power, facility, 
knowledge, skill, and at the same time the disposition to use 
these for the good not only of the individual but also of his 
associates, his country, and even of his age in so far as 
capacity and opportunity fit him for service beyond his 
immediate environment. 
The college graduate who returns to his native town 
with bad habits and lowered ideals may have added to his 
knowledge and skill and even to his power and facility in 
certain directions, but he is trained rather than educated, 
if his éollege years have resulted in a real decrease in his 
ability to serve. His teachers may even have conferred 
upon him a degree, but he is not educated so long as there 
are gaps in his attainment likely to interfere seriously 
with his final efficiency. 
2. Definition of education. — Education is most satis- 
factorily defined in terms of its aim which in turn must be 
1
-P-A-G-E-18
2 , HABIT-FORMATION 
derived from the end of man as determined by ethics 
This has been stated in the perfection-theory of ethics a 
“ the realization of the highest self.” In a social environ 
ment this “realization of the highest self’’ consists in cor 
tributing the highest service that it is possible for the indi 
vidual to render that environment. Nor does this imp] 
any silly self-obliteration. The individual has his ow 
definite value to society both actually and potentially 
and therefore the need of the individual is one of the 
needs of the social whole. Dr, Arnold Tompkins we 
illustrated the over-emphasis of the altruistic point of vier 
in his reference to the two jewelers whose stores locatel 
across the street from each other started to burn simultane 
ously. Since each ran to the store of the other instead d 
rescuing his own stock, their altruism resulted in an avoid 
able loss to both. The student in particular should ap 
preciate the fact that, as a student, he best serves societf 
by furthering his own development, in so far as this fit 
him for service of wider scope. Education, then, is ths 
process by which an individual develops toward the 
highest service possible for him. 
3. Teaching and educating. — Teaching, on the othe 
hand, is a much narrower term. Only by analogy cat 
we speak of the street, the library, or even the college as$ 
teacher. In education the center of interest is in the orga 
ism to be developed; in teaching it is shifted to the activity 
of the developer. This is so true that during many periods 
in the history of civilization the child has been well-ni 
lost sight of in the emphasis upon the teacher’s method, 
The process has been considered without sufficient com 
sideration of its beginning or end. Our present interes 
in child-study represents a wise reaction due to the ree 
ognition of the one-sidedness of our former point 
view; and, as the fervor of that movement sinks to a mor
-P-A-G-E-19
THE TEACHER’S PROBLEM 3 
tormal level, the individual is in danger of being lost sight 
of again, though the extended establishment of schools for 
defectives and special treatment for exceptional children 
have all been outgrowths of the child-study movement, 
which abundantly justify its enthusiasms. When the 
bright child, the only type for which no really satisfactory 
provision has been proposed, is suitably provided for, and 
when these adaptations to individuals of all types have 
been realized practically, even then teaching can be con- 
sidered only one of the factors uniting in the process of 
educating. 
4. Relegation to the teacher of all kinds of training. — 
Another result of the too exclusive focus on the teacher 
has been the tendency to expect him to furnish the youth- 
ful mind with all forms and kinds of training. The 
Practical duties of the home, recreation, care of the health, 
and religious and moral training have too frequently been 
Telegated to the teacher by parents who. could offer far 
superior advantages at home to any the school could 
Possibly afford. o, 
5. The primitive child’s learning. — In primitive lif 
the race left the child to learn as best he could. Each 
factor of his environment contributed its mite toward 
his education. Now his father, now other members of 
the tribe, were imitated; his playmates, brothers, -his Mother, were busy about tasks or recreations, and he 
learned by watching them to engage in similar activities. 
Gradually, as civilization advanced, this hit-or-miss 
Method was replaced by the appointment of a special 
Person whose duty it was to see that certain definite 
things (and many of them) were learned. These definite 
might vary all the way from holding the bow in his 
left hand and arrows in his right to the recital of the heroic deeds of his tribal ancestors, while what the boy of the 
“A
-P-A-G-E-20
4 HABIT-FORMATION 
present has to learn varies from a way of holding the pen 
to a series of facts in the history of the United States. 
6. Definition of teaching. — Anything known may he 
taught, not only knowledge apart from action but action 
itself. The child is taught both to do things and how to do 
them skillfully, i.e. unerringly, rapidly, or automatically. 
The teacher may so modify the environment of the child 
as to bring about situations that arouse feeling of one sort 
or another and tend to refine or direct his emotional 
activity. In short, teaching is the process by which 4 
person possessed of a definite knowledge or skill guides an- 
other to the possession of similar knowledge or skill. This 
does not mean that a person may not lead the child to 
learn what the teacher does not know himself. But in 
that case the teacher teaches what he knows, and then sels 
the pupil to work out that which the teacher does not 
know and therefore, strictly speaking, cannot teach. In 
the meantime the teacher may also be learning, and thus 
become able to teach what he did not know before. No 
matter how significant or insignificant the knowledge im- 
parted may be, it is still teaching, and without regard to 
whether it leads to greater or less efficiency. 
7. The relation of the teacher to environment. — The 
teacher is then a factor placed in the environment of the 
child with a fourfold function. In the first place, he may 
add to that environment desirable features otherwise in 
accessible. Secondly, he may emphasize features of the 
environment, which would otherwise escape notice or be 
only hastily regarded. Thirdly, he may forestall and 
remove undesirable features of the child’s environment 
Fourthly, undesirable elements of the environment, which 
are inevitable, may be slurred over with a passing notice of 
presented in their most favorable aspects. Teaching has, 
therefore, a definite, positive function.
-P-A-G-E-21
THE TEACHER'S PROBLEM 5 
8. The function of the teacher and the child’s experi- 
ences. — As Professor Adams has pointed out, the verb do- 
cwit in the sentence, ‘‘ Magister Johannem Latinam docuit,” 
takes two accusatives. There is the boy taught and the 
subject or lesson that he is to learn. The nature of this 
something to be learned deserves a little further attention. 
We often speak of it as if it had some separate existence. 
We speak of giving knowledge as we might of giving dollars. 
We ask the child if he has the idea as we might if he has a 
new hat. We hope that he may get a desirable habit, as 
we hope that he may secure some prize. We forget that 
what the child learns is a phase of his growth, and in for- 
getting this we lose much of the real nature of the learning 
Process. The child gets experiences. He finds himself 
in real situations. He finds in one particular that it is 
pleasanter on the whole to act in this or that way, or in an- 
other to stop and think before he acts. He manages to 
Temember somewhat of these situations, and in subsequent 
situations which are similar makes some use of his previous 
experience. He is or should be in better shape to meet the 
Same situation the tenth time than he was the first. Even 
the good teacher is not he who never makes a mistake, 
but he who never makes the same mistake twice. Hu- 
manum est errare, sed insipientis im errore perseverare. 
What is the difference between the first and the tenth 
istance? Simply one of organization. Previous expe- 
Tlences in one case have been sifted or have sifted them- 
selves ; the most satisfactory or successful ways of dealing 
With the given situation have been noted; and this knowl- 
edge or ability has been turned to account in later cases 
Where it did not exist in the first. This means that ex- 
Petiences have been organized, sorted, useless impulses have 
0 thwarted, helpful ones have been reénforced and 
*teouraged. One person pictures for a child the ocean

in a calm. Another, who has seen it in a storm, speaks 
of the big waves pounding in, the white foam, and the 
tossing of the big ship. The child asks his mother which 
is right. He gets through the answer an organization of 
his ideas of the sea which will help him in understanding 
future statements of that nature. Similarly, we ourselves 
say we “can’t make head or tail out’? of an obscure parr 
graph when we mean we can’t organize it satisfactorily. 
9. Typical differences in attainment. — If we examine 
children or grown persons who differ in what they have 
learned, we recognize certain types. One seems crammed 
with what is called information rather than knowledge, 
the distinction being that knowledge implies organization, 
while information may mean mere scattered scraps 
knowledge. On the other hand, the lawyer noted for his 
keenness is one who not only has his knowledge organized, 
but also has definite (.e. organized) ways of using it ia 
getting at fine distinctions and discovering applications. 
Cleverness implies a somewhat similar but looser sort of 
organization, while brilliancy, like general quickness of 
action, refers rather to natural readiness to make and us 
organized experience than to any magical ready-made 
equipment. 
In skill the gradual elimination of unnecessary and 
hindering movements, the discovery of little swings and 
twists assisting in the task imply organization. In acct 
racy the same organization is found. Executive ability, 
whether in the schoolroom or in the office of a great 
mercantile establishment, is almost a synonym for ability 
to organize. The training of teachers is an attempt so t0 
organize the various kinds of knowledge and activity » 
teaching, that, given any concrete situation, the best possi 
ble use may be made of it. 
Io. Organization of experience the essential of progres
-P-A-G-E-23
! THE TEACHER’S PROBLEM 7 
| —In all types of learning it is evidently the organization 
_ of experiences which is the underlying important element 
common and essential to all. In the realm of knowledge 
it implies classification, generalization, system, or orderly 
arrangement of ideas; in the realm of practical skill it 
implies automatic action, appointed times, places, and 
even ways of acting, — in a word, habit. 
We thus see that the organizing tendency which has 
resulted in nations, the division of labor, the use of ma- 
chines, and of late in our labor unions, big corporations, and 
political parties is a tendency to be counted upon and 
tendered effective in the child’s development. 
There are, however, so many useless and even hindering 
forms of organization that the child, if left to himself, is 
bound to waste much of his effort. With the aid of the 
teacher his energy is directed to channels of proved effi~ 
ciency, resulting in an enormous increase in the effective~ 
ness of his organizations. 
Organization of experience is, then, the excuse for the 
existence of the teacher. The child would in many en- 
vironments get a sufficient number of experiences; but if he 
is to profit by them, they must be of a useful character and 
he must be led to select here and combine there until he 
has so arranged elements of his experience as to make 
them yield the maximum of. utility. 1 The conditions and limits of organization. — Nor are 
organizations taught for their own sakes; there would be 
t limit to the possibility of useful combination and selec-

tates teaching that adapts itself to the definite and concrete 
situations of life. The object of that education must be 
enabled not only to gain a conerete understanding of the 
situation, but also to work out his own course of action in 
accord with the wisdom born of past experience, rendered 
fruitful, perhaps, by experimentation and purged by mix 
take and failure. 
12. The mistake of modern pedagogy. —- Modern pedr 
gogy has shown a tendency to follow false gods and ha 
sought the elusive general notion or the more definite 
practical skill, but nowhere has there been more than the 
faintest glimmer of recognition that the teacher’s aim is 
always the organization of the child’s experience, whethe 
that experience is made up largely of sense impressions 
of thought elaborations, or of muscular movement. By 
no verbal juggling can this organizing tendency be escaped: 
It has developed the general notion itself; habituation is 
a phase of it; custom, fashion, system, classification have 
all resulted from it. Disorganization is a synonym fot 
confusion. Organization insures increased efficiency and 
potentiality for the pupil who has secured it, — in a word, 
success for the teacher. 
13. Summary. — Education implies growth, increased 
power, facility, knowledge, skill, and an ability to use all 
of these with wisdom. It may be defined as the proces 
by which an individual develops toward the highest 
service possible for him. 
Teaching is a narrower term in which the emphasis 8 
on the developer rather than on the organism to be devel 
oped. In the past this emphasis has been disastrous and 
has resulted in the relegation to the teacher of all kinds of 
training. The primitive child learned as best he could

THE TEACHER’S PROBLEM — 9 
Teaching is the process by which a person possessed of 
definite knowledge or skill leads another to acquire similar 
knowledge or ability. : 
The function of the teacher with relation to the child’s 
environment is (a) to add to or (6) to subtract therefrom 
and (c) to emphasize desirable or (d) to slur over undesir- 
able features of that environment. The function of the 
teacher as regards the child’s experiences is to help him 
organize them and weigh them, to thwart useless and to 
teénforce and encourage useful impulses." ” "has 
Knowledge, information, keenness, cleverness, brillianey,. 
skill, executive ability, training, and the like are all types 
of attainment involving more or less organization. Organ- 
ization of experience is, then, the underlying process in all 
learning. In knowledge it implies. orderly arrangement ‘ 
of ideas; in practical skill it implies habit. The organiza~ — 
tion of experience is, then, the excuse for the existence of 
the teacher, since it is not the number“bat the chatacter 
and use made of experiences, which give them value. 
This aim of teaching is itself subservient to service, the 
end of education, which thus gives direction and point to the teaching process. Modern pedagogy has sought 
general notions and practical skill to the neglect of the 
basis of both, organization. This key to progress cannot 
be escaped ; disorganization is a synonym for confusion.

CHAPTER II : 
Dominant Mops oF ORGANIZING EXPERIENCE | 
“ As the twig is bent, the tree’s inclined.” 
TracHinG in any phase has for its immediate aim th 
effective organization of the learner’s experience. Acct 
mulated knowledge is old experience made availabl 
for future situations. -Habits, good or bad, are old & 
periences in performing certain acts so organized thal 
without thought of the details involved, and almost with 
out feeling, the complicated reactions take place in a fixe 
order. 
1. The narrower meaning of experience. — This tert 
“ experience ” is‘here used with a latitude quite beyond it 
more ordinary signification, and should be examined if ¥ 
are to consider the ways in which experience is organized 
The word is often employed in a narrower sense to indicat 
@ person’s confused feelings, thoughts, and actions at a tim! 
of stress. In common speech it refers rather to feelings 
and so experiences are classed as pleasant or unpleasatt 
Our acts, our thoughts, or our memories are less oftel 
included. When something happens to us, we have hal 
an experience. 
2. Experience as a psychological term. — The psychole 
gist to-day uses the term in a far wider sense. The int 
mate connection between the thinking, feeling, and willist 
activities of the mind being recognized, the terms “ expe! 
ence” and “ phenomenon” have been drafted into his ser? 
ice to cover the sum-total, taken as a unit, of the activitid 
of which there is consciousness during a certain peri

MODES OF ORGANIZING EXPERIENCE il 
What an experience we say a person had in a railroad acci- 
dent, during a burglary, in a bargain crush, on a cold day, 
or ata picnic. But it is just as appropriate to say that a 
life which has been most uneventful is made up of as many 
experiences as there are distinguishable units in it, whether 
they are interpretations of sensory impressions, the fig- 
ments of the imagination, or the products of more compli- 
cated mental processes. The reader of the newspaper has 
as many experiences as there are items that he reads: The 
tailor has an experience for every movement of which he is 
conscious, and for such combinations of stitches or move- 
ments as he is conscious of as combinations, even when not . 
aware of the details involved in the combinations. The 
teacher must have experience, we say. But every one has 
experience. Life without experience would not be life 
but death. We mean that he must have experiences of 
Many and varied kinds in actual teaching; and moreover 
thst they must be in such form as to be of assistance in - 
future emergencies, i.e. in future experiences. The pupil 
must have experience of a kind that will fit him for life 
and its contingencies, and these contingencies as they 
anse will be in their turn experiences. : 
3. Phases of experience. — Any of life’s happenings, 
Provided only we are conscious of them, any of the dullest 
and most prosaic as well as the most exalted moments, 
the moment when the maiden declares herself bored to 
death, as well as the moment when she answers the ques- 
tion which is to decide whether she is to lead a life of 
single or of wedded blessedness, the longest and the short- 
et, the most significant and the most insignificant mo- 
Ments may be considered experiences, perhaps made up 
Ofsmaller experiences. Thus all our thoughts, ideas, feel- 
ings, emotions, tendencies to act, and actual actions 
themselves are so interwoven with some experience or
-P-A-G-E-28
12 HABIT-FORMATION 
other that they may be considered only as phases of1 
wider activity. 
A case of indecision may illustrate the point. We my 
ourselves be undecided whether to go to the theater a! 
the opera on a certain occasion. As a whole this cat 
of indecision is an experience, in which first we may be cor 
scious primarily of knowing that we are undecided; # 
secondly, we may be annoyed at our inability to make wy 
our minds; or thirdly, we may be conscious of a certalt 
tendency to move this way or the other and note that # 
are holding ourselves in leash, so to speak, until we hart 
come toa decision. This knowledge, feeling of annoyant) 
and inhibited tendency to act are phases or elements of tl 
experience, and are inextricably united or even jumbled 
together; but we may be relatively much more conscios 
of one phase than of another in greatly varying proportions 
So, when confronted with a bill of fare, we have a confu! 
experience as we decide quickly on roast chicken 9 
roast beef and the items of secondary importance on tht 
card. We may dwell on different phases, or on all of thet 
‘in rapid succession. A choice between the advantages dl 
the shore and the country for vacation, between work al 
play, between walking with one friend or another, if made 
consciously, is an experience in which now knowledge, 204 
feeling, and now action or tendencies to action may prt 
dominate in consciousness. | 
The term “experience,” as commonly applied in religiov 
teaching, is used of some occasion when strong feeling b¥ 
been aroused, when new and unexpected phases of feelint 
have manifested themselves. But sometimes those &* 
periences involve deep conviction, while on other occasio# 
they may involve heroic self-sacrifice; that is, in one cast 
strong feeling accompanies thoughts and beliefs, while ® 
another it attends eaternal action or conduct. It is @
-P-A-G-E-29
MODES OF ORGANIZING EXPERIENCE 13 
mistake, however, for him whose religious development 
has been a steady growth, without marked crises or cli- 
maxes, to assume that he has never had any religious ex- 
perience. Whatever he has of religious or moral character 
is the result of a gradual organization of his experience into 
convictions, principles, and habits of conduct. 
4. Unlearned capabilities, automatic and purposive 
learning. — Nature has provided plants, animals, and man 
with many ways of adjusting themselves to their environ- 
ment, but only animals and man organize their experiences 
so as to make them of use to them in future situations. 
Some kinds of mice can learn to go to a little house with a 
blue-colored front, because it suggests food to them, as 
they have always found it there, and not in a similar one ~ 
with a red front. Other kinds, the dancing mice, do not 
learn this so readily, probably because the brightness of 
colors rather than their color value has played the most 
important part in the past of this species.t It has been said 
that bees can distinguish colors and associate them with 
sweetened water. These animals, and in fact animals in | 
general, have the ability, as we say, naturally to do thou- 
sands of appropriate things whenever the appropriate stimu- 
lus presents itself. If the newly hatched chicken spies an 
attractive piece of corn within easy range, he is likely with 
a quick dive of the head to snap it up by a series of muscu- 
lar movements quite complicated in their totality, but all 
Coérdinated or organized from the first. The chicken 
does not have to learn this accomplishment. A young 
child also can perform many kinds of action without 
learning, as, for example, in movements of head, limbs, 
and other parts of the body. 
Compare the difficulty a child a year old and able to

walk has in picking up something with his hands. 
makes many motions, sometimes overreaching, some 
times falling short, and in the end probably falls fle 
The child has to learn both to walk and to pick things wp, 
but he learns both without realizing that he is learniy 
them. His learning is spontaneous. 
There are, then, some things that man and animal 
can do without learning, and some things they have # 
learn, but that they learn automatically. Besides thes 
easier tasks there are many others that man may lean, 
but only through definite thinking or direction, with a dit 
tinct aim in view, rather than automatically, without aty 
consciousness of his learning. The child may recogni 
his father’s authority instinctively even without learning 
He may by imitation think of some things as right 0 
wrong without being taught. There are others he must 
taught and must learn with a definite purpose and effort 
or he will not make the distinction. Life presents m@ 
with many complications and involved situations fot 
which he has no automatic adjustment. If he is to met 
the requirements of the situation, he must do so by a deb 
nite grasp first of the details of the environment bearing # 
the problem and at the same time of the end to be attained 
Man begins life painfully unfitted for these complex s+ 
justments; but his very helplessness has a function, in thé 
it leaves him free to develop the power to make just th! 
adaptations of attention and effort necessary later in lif 
for the most intricate situations. 
The fatalist may regard even elaborate thought pr 
cesses as automatic, but the term “ automatic learning” 
here used of a self-carrying or self-working process » 
which there is no thought or attention given to any a 
or result of the process. In sharp distinction the te 
“ purposive learning” is applied to any learning process ¥
-P-A-G-E-31
MODES OF ORGANIZING EXPERIENCE 15 
which an aim is recognized and worked toward, whether 
by a person’s unaided thinking or by the direction and 
assistance of a teacher. 
5. Two types of automatic learning. — These automatic 
self-working ways of organizing experiences must be a little 
further examined. As already stated, they are of two 
types. Some, which aid him far more than we ordinarily 
realize, are natural, inborn, or instinctive. All imitative 
tendencies, play tendencies, constructive, experimenting, 
and expressive tendencies, not to mention the assignment 
of meaning to various sense stimuli, and thousands of 
definite impulses to function with involved muscle combi- 
nations, such as the tendencies to make the eyes focus 
together, the inclination to reach for things, or to hold the 
body erect in a sitting posture, — all of these are auto- 
matic tendencies of a natural or instinctive order. : 
But besides these, man early acquires automatic tend- 
encies and abilities quite beyond the compass of his 
Ustural equipment. Man is gifted natively with a brief 
and fleeting form of attention, but by exercise and wise: 
Guidance its effectiveness may be greatly increased both 
4sto direction and span. Imagination and memory may 
be natively vigorous in a desultory and disorganized sort 
of way, and yet be comparatively helpless when confronted | 
With a situation requiring the organization of details into 
Ssystem or unit. For example, children may get a great 
deal of pleasure out of fairy stories long before they un- 
derstand much from the various disconnected and often 
ieorrect interpretations they give to the words they have 
d, A two-year-old child of my acquaintance enjoys 
heating his father read to him books that he certainly

recognized. This tendency is shown also in childist 
explanations of things. One young man noticed thi 
leaves, sticks, and stones left standing some time on the! 
pond where he skated gradually sank into the ice. Heat 
ticed also that skate marks and flakes of snow gradually 
disappeared from the smooth surface. Such data led his 
to explain to himself the phenomenon as due to the fad 
that the water worked through the pores of the ice at 
froze on the top. It is evident that he had not heard d 
radiation from dark as compared with light surface 
but he manifested a well-developed, automatic tendency 
explain things, which is quite beyond the power of mi 
natively. 
Similarly, a child wants to know who made God or why 
this or that action is right or wrong, or what keeps th 
moon from falling, and where the rain comes from,~ 
questions which plainly show that, untaught, he is seekitt 
explanations. Again, the child finds the world so complet 
and varied with so many unpleasant and pleasant exper 
ences that he soon discovers the usefulness of his elders¥ 
providing him with pleasant experiences or in warning 
guarding him against the unpleasant whenever he fea 
uncertain in a new situation. That is, the child tends # 
fall back on the authority of the older person and aul} 
matically to accept, up to a certain point, the dogmati 
verdict of his elders as to the desirability or undesirabiliff 
of acourse of action. Neither the child nor the grown p 
son is, as a rule, conscious of this acceptance of the thougt! 
of another as his own, but examples of it are evides| 
enough in the spheres of religion, politics, precedent 
law), fashion, and in fact all of life’s activities. 
This very acceptance on the part of the child of 
other’s judgment at this and that point is practical 
certain to involve him in inconsistency in his thinkish
-P-A-G-E-33
MODES OF ORGANIZING EXPERIENCE 7 
When the young man gets his religious truths or beliefs 
from one authority, his science from another, and his 
ethics from still another, it is not strange if the automatic 
tendency to organize these various truths involves him 
in serious doubts and difficulties. He will automatically 
work out or try to work out his problems. Shall we com- 
mand him not to think, whether he belongs to the clergy 
or laity? That were to end his education, then and there 
to stop his growth. Shall we stop his speech? That were 
to rob him of half his manhood. 
The automatic ways of organizing experience are, then, 
(1) a wide range (as we shall see later) of instinctive ways 
with which man is natively equipped, and (2) a large class of modified, combined, or selected ways which gradually 
develop according as satisfaction has been gained through — 
their chance employment. These acquired automatic 
ways of organizing experience may be grouped in classes 
of which the most important are interpretations of and 
adaptations to complex sense experience, the use of the 
imagination in suggesting new truths or new ways of doing 
things, the acceptance of truth or error on authority, the 
| Use of reason in criticising and reénforcing suggestions of 
the imagination, and various subtle feeling and will atti- 
tudes of mind favorable in the main to bringing experi- 
ences into such combinations as to make them of in- . 
Creased service, 
6. A definite end necessary for purposive learning. — By 
Purposive learning is meant the way we always proceed 
when we set out to learn something and the way we usually 
ave in mind when we start out to teach something, This 
‘ort of learning is evidently chiefly distinguished from 
nit automatic mode of organizing experience by its recog- 
‘on of an end to be accomplished, whether the experi- 
“ice embraces a problem to be worked out in thought or a
-P-A-G-E-34
18 HABIT-FORMATION 
knack to be acquired like that of balancing one’s self in 
riding a bicycle. 
This end should always be definite. Neither pupil not 
teacher will get farther than he would in a daydream ur 
less there is a definite idea to be attained, a definite feeling 
to be worked toward, or a definite degree or kind of ski 
to be acquired; and even these should not be desired for 
themselves alone. The principle of service, the highet 
service, all values being considered, is at bottom thst 
which must decide on the course of development. 
y. The concrete as a factor in purposive learning.- 
There should always be provided either actually or it 
imagination the concrete situation which gives point and 
meaning to that which is taught. The unanimity with 
which the world’s great teachers have used the parable 
the fable, the dialogue, the historical illustration, eit 
phasizes the value of the concrete situation for establishing 
truth. Any situation presents data of one sort or anothe 
It may be organized with a view to the present adapt 
tion, or its present significance may be disregarded in fav 
of a future possible situation for which more data a 
needed; or a general truth may be sought which is # 
adapt itself to so many applications in varied conerel# 
situations that we are sometimes in danger of forgetting i# 
definiteness in our contemplation of it as an abstractio? 
My idea of triangle is just as definite as my idea of al! 
given triangle; the idea that all bodies are subject to 
law of gravitation is psychologically just as definite as th 
thought that this pen is attracted in some degree by the 
moon. The definiteness of the abstraction is, howevél 
approximately proportionate to that of the concrete & 
amples illustrating or contributing to it. Those tru 
that lack the red blood of concreteness, those that we f 
to apply in our lives, have been aptly termed “ bedriddé

truths,” anzmic, fit only to be kept upstairs, not for con- 
tact with men. Abstractions must not be regarded as 
necessarily hazy. When they are obscure, it is proof posi- 
tive of an inadequacy in our experience, an inadequacy 
capable of removal only by more concrete experiences. 
In general, the more concrete the situations, the more defi- 
aile the organization of them will be; and the history of 
education, like the history of philosophy and the history 
of religion, is witness to the general futility of attempting to 
organize abstractions without regard to the concrete data 
on which they are based, and the concrete situations, real 
orimaginary, to which they are to apply. 
8. The automatic and purposive ways of learning inter- 
mingle. —~To illustrate the different degrees or proportions, 
in which the same action may involve both the automatic 
and the conscious ways of learning, involves finding a feat 
of manual dexterity which a boy and an elderly man may 
both learn to perform. Comparison of the learning pro- 
cess in the following case, which illustrates the automatic, 
with one where reasoning is more prominent, will not be 
difficult, since even those who have not played golf have 
Practiced hitting at something with a stick at some time 
or other. 
A young boy learns to play golf largely by taking 
the sticks as he has seen some one hold them and whack- 
ng at the ball in a haphazard fashion. Sometimes he hits 
it squarely, and then he gets a satisfaction that tends to 
Impress on him the memory of the movement resulting in 
this satisfaction. He tries the next time to reproduce this 
feeling and to locate the point of difference, though he is 
or may be conscious of none of these efforts on his part. 
He keeps trying and trying until he succeeds, noting 
Meanwhile how other people stand, hold their clubs, and 
swing, and comparing their ways with his, A man fifty

or sixty years old, on the other hand, tries this method 
but makes no such progress. He is not free to establishs 
dozen new ways of getting a swing, as the boy is. He hw 
one or two already established ways of turning on his fed 
and of swinging his arms, but these, unfortunately, are nd 
such as to help him in his golf. He must therefore nt 
merely recognize and strive for the details of the right 
way, but he must more or less consciously break up the old 
ways. His chances of success are poor unless he is wise] 
directed, 7.e. taught. 
Suppose, on the other hand, a new gardener is to be et 
ployed. The boy and the old man are to discover whetht 
the applicant is likely to prove desirable or undesirable 
The boy sees only a man before him. He has featur 
not greatly different from those of the average man. He 
drawls a little, is dressed in farmer’s attire, is of mediu® 
height, talks softly, and looks physically able. The be! 
has seen and heard a few things, but in the end this is olf 
aman, and the boy does not feel at all certain as to bis 
qualifications, as a gardener. The old man, however, Dt 
tices the applicant’s eye especially, and the straightfor 
ward glance with the sympathetic and half-anxious loa 
on his face. He questions him as to where he has work 
before and notes the readiness with which he replies. 
finds out just what his duties were, why he left, what be 
liked or disliked about his work, gets his taste in arrangié 
trees, shrubs, and flowers, tests him as to his willignes 
to undertake little jobs aside from the regular work of te 
gardener, asks about his family and where he lives, or 
courages his confidence as to his intentions regarding the 
future, and so through these and many other questioss 
gets material for an estimate of the kind of person he ® 
All this would have been quite impossible for the bof 
The boy automatically noted 4 few things, but could 1

MODES OF ORGANIZING EXPERIENCE 21 
possibly come to any fair estimate of the man’s ability 
because he lacked resources to work out the problem, 
although he may have recognized definitely enough its 
general nature. His only hope would be in being directed, 
ie taught. The man of experience had not only the prob-* 
lem but organized experiences from which he could esti- 
mate and imagine the man’s past, present, and even 
future work as a gardener in varied situations. In this 
case his past experience being organized was of distinct 
advantage, whereas in the case of golf-playing the particu- 
lar forms of organization were an actual hindrance. 
_o The effect of previous expetience on purposive learn- 
ing. — It is evident that in the purposive mode of learning 
itis necessary at times to break up undesirable and to form 
desirable connections between our various mental processes, 
according as a given situation is interfered with by the un- 
desirable connections or is too complex for the connec- 
“ions already made among our mental processes. 
The elderly man had to break up the established ways 
of raising his arms above his head and to find freer and 
More effective ways which had to be codrdinated into one 
vigorous swing. The boy had almost no basis in his ex- 
Perience which would help him in hiring a gardener. The 
Situation was too complex. The elderly man could, how- 
fan teach him in part at least how to meet such a situa- 
on,

the positive development of good feeling, good traits, gool

is little to be wondered at that our precepts are not mor 
attractive. 
zo. The teacher and the ways of organizing experienc. 
— What, then, is the function of the teacher with relation 
to these two ways of organizing experience? ‘The teache 
is an element, thrust into the environment of the child, 
which not only changes it but is there expressly to mr 
nipulate the environment so that the child may learn th 
essentials agreed upon or left to the teacher’s discretion 
The teacher may (as indeed he too often does) neglect al 
the automatic (both natural and acquired) ways of leant 
ing which the child has, and insist that he work out every- 
thing systematically and under guidance. This is to hand:

and the boy tries to improve up to the point where th

letter may be sent. A teacher is necessary for such sug- 
gestions. The child would not think of them himself. 
11, Negative teaching. — All this applies to that which 
should be called positive teaching. In teaching negatively 
(.. what the child should noé do), it is the function of the 
teacher go to manipulate the child’s environment that he 
may be protected from temptations that are greater than 
he is prepared to resist and are serious in their results, and 
at the same time to guard him from inevitable temptation 
by appeals to his fear of danger, and by depicting to his 
_imesinatign the evils and sorrows that weak courses of 
ion are likely to bring in their train. But in no case 
should effort be wasted in this direction, unless there is a 
real danger which calls for preventive action. 
12. Neglect of the automatic.— The teacher’s error 
often consists in a disdain of the automatic ways of 
learning. If he can’t “ding” things into the boy’s head 
and make him say them parrot-like, he seems to take it 
for granted the child is learning nothing. In teaching 
children en masse this neglect of the automatic is almost 
certain to play a serious part. It is at the root of all 
lock-step and routine procedure, the special bane of large 
School systems, and seems almost to justify splitting them 
Up into separately directed subdivisions. In the hurry 
and scurry to bring up to the standard those children that 
are slow and irregular in attendance, the teacher forgets 
that the brighter children learn much automatically and 
do Not need the formal treatment necessary for others. It 
8 a waste of time to teach a cat to wash itself. This dis- 
Tegard of the instinctive and acquired aids in learning has 
to serious errors in our practice, and is perhaps nowhere 
iter illustrated than in our religious teaching, where we 
insist on preaching, revival meetings, Bible study, —

some +o those whom we fain would teach, while litile o i") 
account is taken either of the natural or acquired waysd 
learning, even in so important a matter as the essential 
of Christian living. We throw the limelight on the nay 
belief and fail to emphasize his conduct. Provide placa 
where people may spend their leisure amid uplifting in 
fluences, where ideals are built up and lofty motive 
enkindled; give them literature and encouragement which 
will aid them in and perhaps even lift them to a highet 
and less mechanical plane of work; establish mor 
“People’s Palaces” and the like and there will be an im 
petus given to Christian living through the automatit 
ways of learning not afforded by hundreds of sermon 
and a thousand recitals of religious experience. Nor am! 
underestimating the value of these sermons and recitals 
in teaching ideals, moral principles, or religious belief. 
The tendency of the teacher is elsewhere, as in religiow 
teachings, to dwell on the purposive way of learning, # 
let the child see what is to be thought out or done, and thet 
to help him to do it formally and pedantically, forgetting 
that the child’s automatic ways of learning must permeate 
even the purposive ways and are going to give him mud 
knowledge and many kinds of skill not dreamed of even by 
the thoughtful teacher. 
A child who had learned only that which he had set out 
to learn, and only what his teacher had definitely intended 
to teach, would rival Frankenstein’s monster. 
13.. Five fundamental principles. — In conclusion, m¥ 
ture has provided abundant ways of learning. The 
instinctive ways are the basis. Out of these grow the 
more complicated habitual but still automatic ways 
The teacher must use the instinctive and develop and 
use the habitual to be successful. They are not to bt 
regarded as helps in time of need, but as the life-giving
-P-A-G-E-41

principle of all teaching. Hence (1), in moral, religious, 
or other teaching, never teach formally what will with equal \ 
advantage be learned automatically. (2) In any teaching 
connect as soon as possible with the automatic ways of 
learning. (3) Base all future accomplishment on past 
achievement. (4) In purposive learning let the child not 
merely realize that a worthy and definite end is sought, 
but (5) let that aim be nourished on concrete experience, 
with full appreciation of its practical utility in possible or 
probable future contingencies. 
14. Summary. — The term ‘‘ experience ” is used for any 
of life’s happenings, internal or external, of which there is 
consciousness. Thoughts or ideas, feelings or emotions, 
tendencies to act and acts themselves, are interwoven in 
experiences, 
Plants, animals, and men are provided by nature with 
many ways of adjusting themselves to environment. 
But only animals and man organize experiences. Children 
Perform some sorts of acts spontaneously without having to 
Jean how; others they learn automatically, without direc- 
tion and effort, while still other acts are performed only as 
the outcome of thought and purposive effort. 
In large part, automatically, the fleeting forms ‘of 
attention native in man become stable and controlled, 
Mmagination is transformed from promiscuous fancy to 
organized construction and reasoning, memory. from 
chaos to system. Automatically the child learns to 
Tegard or disregard authority. Much inconsistency re- 
sults from automatic acceptation of authorities which are 
contradictory in their implications. The chance variation 
he conduct of whatever sort, provided it is found satis- 
actory, tends to become automatic, if the satisfaction 
‘ontinues long enough. Automatisms may be grouped 
‘cording as they enter into sense experience, imaginative

processes, acceptance of authority, the use of reasoning 
processes, feeling states, or will attitudes. 
Purposive learning is distinguished by a recognition o 
the end to be attained, which should be definite. Reliance 
must be placed on the concrete as illustrating and contrib 
ting to the more general aim and giving it point. All 
history is witness to the futility of abstractions which lack 
concrete content. 
The automatic and purposive ways of learning inte 
mingle, and in different proportions for individuals # 
different stages of growth. The young are quick 
attain results experimentally and are free from obstructing 
habits of movement. The old are rich in the resources of 
experience and more or less obstructed by previous habits 
of action. In forming new modes of action, it is often 
necessary (1) to inhibit certain actions, and (2) to compl: 
cate into one organization various mental and musculat 
adjustments of an elementary character. 
The function of the teacher is so to manipulate th 
child’s environment as to stimulate him to automatit 
learning and at the same time to lead him to the acquis- 
tion of truth and dexterity otherwise impossible. In addi 
tion, the teacher must protect the child from temptatiom 
and fortify him against those that are inevitable. 
The teacher’s error consists in a disdain of the automatit 
and over-emphasis of the purposive way of learning 
Religious teaching illustrates this neglect; but it is mank 
fest in all teaching and culminates in formal pedantry: 
Automatic must permeate purposive learning. Heneé 
(1) never teach formally what will be learned with equal 
advantage automatically; (2) connect as soon as possible 
with the automatic; (3) base future accomplishment 
past achievement; (4) point out a worthy and definite 
end; and (5) associate with the ends abundant concrel# 
experience.

CHAPTER, IIT 
TypicaL Forms oF ORGANIZED EXPERIENCE 
“Happy is the man whose habits are his friends.” 
: — SHAKESPEARE. 
In the preceding chapter it was shown that the child has 
automatic ways of organizing his experience, and other 
ways, the purposive, adapted to the more complicated situ- 
ations of civilized life. In this chapter the results of these 
ways are to be considered to see if the diversity presented 
admits of classification. If we know how the child learns, 
and the nature of what we wish him to learn, we may 
teasonably expect to get some fairly definite methods of 
teaching these ends. 
_l The variety in the child’s experience. —- Here is 4 
| list of some of the child’s achievements. He learns, 
Perhaps all in the same day, to tie his necktie in a bow, 
to jump a post, that Mr. Blank, his neighbor, keeps a 
Jewelry store, that London is the largest city in the world, 
how to do short division, that his teacher sometimes 
fays things that she doesn’t mean (or else forgets), the 
Way to pronounce a few words, how to abbreviate New 
York, and to spell “ business,” a short cut from his house to 
the ball ground, that he can run faster than the new boy at 
shool, that he likes to hear a certain piece of music, 
that he doesn’t like olives, that oil is lighter than water, 
that Abraham Lincoln did not have the chance to study 
and learn that he has (though this may not be so), and 
% on,—a heterogeneous mass of impressions, facts, 
truths, circumstances, events, principles, names of objects, 
their properties, dimensions, relations, etc., — a motley ar- 
ty to which must be added (if we count first efforts as jus- 
27
-P-A-G-E-44
28 HABIT-FORMATION 
tifying us in the use of the word “ learned’) how to do 
many varied sorts of things, how to work various muscles 
in such a sequence as to produce a required movement, 
how he feels when he is cross or anxious or angry or afraid, 
how to treat various people, how he can refrain from 
responding to impulses which he has learned are unplea 
ant or undesirable in the responses they excite. 
2. Knowledge as a type of organized experience. — In 
all this multiplicity of things to learn or things learned, 
what common element can be found? Historically, ides 
have been emphasized from Plato to Spencer as the objet 
tive point in learning. Herbart recognized the com 
plexity of what is taught, and expounded the “circle of 
thought” and the ideas or thought-masses. They are to 
be formed in building character, but he did not formulate 
a scheme for securing the habits absolutely fundamental to 
character. Spencer, while making “complete living” bis 
aim of education, has followed the previous trend by 
assuming that knowledge was the essential of complete 
living, as is implied in his chapter, “What knowledge is 
of most worth” and in his answer, that the knowledge of 
most worth is science, ¢.e. organized or classified knowledge. 
But 7s knowledge the essential of complete living? 
More recently Professor De Garmo, in his “ Essentials 
of Method,” and the McMurrys, in their “Method of the 
Recitation,” fail to recognize any form of teaching that does 
not assert the claim of general notions to the distinction 
of furnishing the goal of instruction. Is this still more 
limited field of human activity the goal of teaching? 
3. The error of neglecting the doing phases of experi- 
ence. — The limitation in the viewpoint of all these educa 
tors has not only added seriously to the necessary clashes 
between the experienced teacher and the novice, but the 
worst result has been that it put the novice in the
-P-A-G-E-45
a, 
2 TYPICAL FORMS OF ORGANIZED EXPERIENCE 29 
wrong at almost the only point where the experienced 
teacher was “dead certain” that he himself was right. 
Schemes of teaching which lacked provision for repetition 
ot drill, or at least substitutes for them, the experienced 
teacher could from his point of view at least afford to dis- 
niss on the mere ground of his experience, whether he 
understood the pedagogical ground for his method or not. 
Any general scheme for teaching which does not set 
forth the process of learning as applied not only to general 
notions but to complex individual notions; not only to 
knowledge or science, but to the practical ability to use it, 
~any scheme which does not show not only how certain 
things are done, but how to do them with facility, accuracy, 
and efficiency in general; not only how to discriminate be- 
tween feelings. to be furthered and encouraged but how to 
wt ourselves to the task of developing them, — all such 
themes are seriously at fault. They fail utterly to take 
into consideration the tremendous value of getting in the 
wy of performing all common acts automatically, thus 
taving consciousness free to focus on the more complex 
thenomena presented, and slight at least half of the 
‘ganizations of experience which the child must secure. 
arning to walk or to swim is not (strictly speaking) 
owledge, much less science, but it is a desirable and 
Weful accomplishment to acquire. We say we know how 
skate or to write, but we do not mean that we know 
tht we do perform these useful acts. We merely mean 
i, we can perform them. These are not bits of knowl- 
iden entialy, much less sciences, thought-masses or 
, but rather forms of reaction which have passed an 
me and uncertain stage and have become auto~ 
l¢, easy, and certain. No one can for a moment com- 
wee disorganized efforts of the beginner at Skating”

out realizing that out of these awkward, spasmodir, 
trembling experiences has come an organization which 
is perfection itself when contrasted with the beginning 
And yet this is not knowledge, but rather skill that has 
been acquired. In the writings of both philosophers and 
advanced theorists little is found to show how one secure 
such automatisms as are involved in learning to write, to 
sing, to draw, to speak correctly, or even to master the 
various arithmetical processes. At the most they have 
indicated only how to get some of the ideas that are fur 
damental to these processes. 
Even Bagley, who sees plainly the importance of habit! 
and touches on the methods of acquiring it in his “‘ Educe 
tive Process,” treats the subject in the most cursory 
fashion; and when driven directly to habit by the problems 
discussed in his “Class Management,” he does nothing 
toward working out the implications of his formulation’ 
of the law of habit. 
No reasonable person would deny that ideas are forms 
_ of organized experience. But experience covers all of 
the conscious mental processes involved at the givel 
period. There is no reason for emphasizing the organiz 
tion of the idea or stimulation phase to the exclusion of the 
reaction or feeling and willing phases; the action or rea 
tion phase of consciousness must be given the place it 
deserves in the organization of experience. Surely it is # 
important in learning from the standpoint of educatiot 
to get good habitual forms of attention, interest, courtesy; 
and good will as it is to get clear ideas. It is as important 
also to organize the feeling side of human nature, but thé 
problem is much simplified, as will be seen later, by the |

TYPICAL FORMS OF ORGANIZED EXPERIENCE 31 
fact that feeling is cultivated only through the ideas which 
underlie it or the habitual reactions with which it is 
closely connected. That is, feeling may be perhaps best 
regarded as a quality or tone involved in ideas and re- 
actions, with which it is so intimately connected as to be 
impossible of development apart from them. 
4. The two marked types of organized experience. — 
This is, then, after all, our question, How are the ex- 
periences organized into automatisms or habits, and how 
ate they organized into ideas varying from fairly simple 
and concrete to those of extreme complexity? The word 
“idea” may be appropriately used? of organized experi- 
nce whether it represents real knowledge of an object, a 
judgment, or only a guess, a fiction of the imagination, a 
Menory-image, a general idea, or a notion of the applica- 
bility of a certain word to a class of objects. One may 
ty, for example, that he had a clear idea of the paper oD Which he writes, or that he has an idea that it may rain 
toon, or he may guess, i.e. have an idea, that a child’s 
tame may be John, or he may imagine and so get an idea 
of himself as a wealthy man or as a prince of the Middle 
Ages, or he may have an idea of the first teacher he remem 
, or of a snow plow. All these are ideas, and (going 
back to our former illustration) it would be manifestly 
Nonsensical to speak of having a habit of the paper or & 
habit that it may rain, and so forth. 
On the other hand, we may speak of a child’s having a 
habit of shuffling his feet, pronouncing distinctly, writing 
with a certain slant, holding his pencil in a certain way, 
butting the divisor, dividend, and quotient in certain posi- 
tions, holding his knife in his right hand, and so forth. 
And it would be equally impossible without changing the 
Neaning to substitute the word “idea” and say he had 
1See Chapter IV.
-P-A-G-E-48
32 HABIT-FORMATION 
an idea of shuffling his feet, pronouncing distinctly, writ 
ing at a certain angle, and so forth. 
5. Confused forms of organization. — The use of such 
terms as appreciations, attitudes, abilities, et cetera, is com 
mon in educational terminology and invariably coves 
up a failure to complete an analysis of what is really 
implied. The practical recommendations growing out 
of such vague terminology must be vague also. Until 
educators have pushed their analysis to the point of dit 
covering what belongs to the methodology of the ide 
11f Andrews, in his article on habit (see American Journal of 
Psychology, Vol. XIV., pp. 121-149), had been dealing with orga 
ized experience instead of mental functioning, he could hardly have 
escaped arriving at the two types already described. He sugges 
subsuming all mental experience under the two heads, “habite! 
and non-habitual functioning,” including in the latter all nové 
experiences. Accordingly, any new act of knowing, feeling, # 
willing, is a form of non-habitual functioning. But elements ot 
knowledge, emotion, or willing may function together in a singt 
moment of consciousness and never again, such organization # 
there was at the moment being lost instanter, but the combinatiat 
would be an idea in so far as it was focalized in consciousnes 
Evidently, when organization of experience is made the goal of 
teaching, the thought is of a repetition or continuance of tht 
functioning upon occasion. When various associations call W 
to focal consciousness certain groups or systems of associal 
experience, the organization is called an idea. Such ideatios 
is not, however, independent of habit. When a certain feeling ¥ 
always evoked by given elements in similar situations, it i 
organized into habit. As long as it is uncertain and variabls 
it must be regarded as an associated phase of consciousné 
not recognized ag immediately necessary to the effective orgatF 
zation of experience. Similarly, acts of decision, of persis 
ence, or of attention may be constant, ¢.e. habitual, in a giv@ 
situation; or on the other hand they may be very uncertain # 
whimsical in nature to a degree accountable only by the lack 
organization in the chance associations which constitute the fur 
damental basis of the action. This basis is ideational.
-P-A-G-E-49
TYPICAL FORMS OF ORGANIZED EXPERIENCE 33 
(used as I have used it in the sense of any definite com- 
prehension) and what to the methodology of habit, the 
sence of teaching can be little more than a pretense. If 
by appreciation is meant at one moment habits of feeling 
and at another habits of expression and at another the 
calling up consciously of masses of associations, surely 
there can be no general method for developing such ap- 
preciations. If one is ever found, it must develop through 
the contributions of the general methods, first of instruc- 
tion and then of habit-forming. The emotions themselves 
are similarly subject for their cultivation to these two 
forms of organization. They can be approached only 
from their idea side or from their reaction (habit) side. 
Attitude is a similar figurative expression implying 
often, perhaps usually, habit, while at other times it refers 
‘o the particular massing of ideas in response to @ given 
atuation, In the word “ability”’ is implied both knowledge 
and skill, or either, according to the reference. It is plain, 
then, that (from the standpoint of method) these are am- 
biguous terms, to be given meaning by reference to the 
Methodology of imparting ideas or of establishing habits. 
Professor Findlay ' makes two divisions of his method, 
the “methods of imparting instruction” and the “method 
of imparting skill.’ He evidently is working toward 
the same fundamental difference in organization that has 
outlined here, but in skill he has hit upon another of 
these unfortunate words. : 
In the first: place, skill is too limited in its application. 
t covers external action fairly well, but habits of thought, 
its of feeling, and habits of decision, and so forth, cannot 
teferred to accurately as forms of skill. Nor does it 
“Ver the automatisms developed, which are too insignifi- 
tant in themselves to be considered as skill. 
‘Findlay, “Principles of Class Teaching,” p. 161. London, 1890.
-P-A-G-E-50
34 HABIT-FORMATION 
In the second place, skill often implies a combination of 
ideas and habits, as it signifies constructive imagination, 
ingenuity, and invention, together with certain habits of 
experimentation. 
Thirdly, it fails on this account to emphasize the auto- 
matic, self-carrying character of the habit forms of organ 
ization, which really distinguish skill from knowledge ot 
the ideational forms. That this side of skill may be neg 
lected is further emphasized by the fact that Professor 
Findlay fails to apply the principles brought out by both 
Professor Bain and Professor James. Nor does he substi 
tute others to cover the same ground. 
Campe '! combines in his use of habit (Gewohnheit) both 
skill (Fertigkeit) and tendency or impulse (Neigung) 
illustrating the difference by stating that the galley sla 
may have skill but no impulse, while the beginner on t 
piano may have the impulse to play magnificently bi 
may lack the skill. In such a mechanical operation 285 
indicated by his illustration, skill and habit mean alot 
the same thing, though even here it is evident that 
applies to general ability in rowing, while the expressios 
habit of rowing, because of its lack of specificness, fails 
_ satisfy, and immediately raises the question, To which 
the numerous habits involved in or associated with rowing! 
reference made? The expression “skill in rowing” excit# 
no such query. The case of the galley slave is somew! 
exceptional, inasmuch as life had necessitated the acquit 
ment of a habit distasteful because of its associations 
fatigue and penal servitude. Ordinarily, when a situati@# 
recurs and is associated at length with some habit of *{ 
acting, there is a satisfaction attached to the experien@ 
in each instance, which develops into the feeling 
1Campe, “‘Philosophischer Commentar tiber die Worte Pie 
tarchs: Die Tugend ist eine lange Gewohnheit.”
-P-A-G-E-51
TYPICAL FORMS OF ORGANIZED EXPERIENCE 35 
familiarity, and constitutes the very prerequisite of the. 
formation of habit. Hence Andrews explains Reid’s? 
“inclination” and Stout’s? “propensity” in part by the 
feeling of “naturalness” or “‘of-courseness” which is. 
involved in habitual acts, when he says,’ “this affective 
characteristic of habit, together with its organization as 
an associated series, explains its impulsiveness.” While 
| this position is well taken, it must be remembered that 
thildren may be habituated to many actions sufficiently 
to get this comparatively weak motive to action, but the 
action will not be forthcoming, because it is completely. 
snowed under by a host of unpleasant feelings which have 
become attached to the response. The feeling of familiar- 
ity, of naturalness, etc., is strong enough to impel when no 
taistance is offered; but it may be met by counter pro- 
Pensities, 
6. Habit and memory. — Another objection to the use of 
the word “skill” for the habit side of method is the fact 
that it does not with fitness refer to mechanical or rote 
Memory, which is for the most part pure habit. The 
®euring of such habits would fit neither in a methodology 
, Of instruction nor in a methodology of skill. In so far as 
@ experiments of Ebbinghaus and others, following his 
i, have dealt with pure repetition and practice on the 
‘asis of successive association, they are as much studies 
'n habit as in memory, and contribute definitely to the 
Methodology of habit. When a person repeats over and

test the ability to reproduce the series correctly, regardles 
of the amount of effort or consciousness involved. This 
undoubtedly means that at least parts of the operationat 
habitual, but it does not mean that the total recall is ow 
habit. Asa contribution to the psychology of habit, there 
fore, such studies are less valuable. 
7. The function of habit.— The importance of habit 
can hardly need emphasis when one considers that it is om 
of the fundamental forms of organization of experient 
Modern psychology, however, has so modified our concer 
tion of habit that an additional word calling attention to 
its function in human economy is desirable. Habit is» 
longer regarded as an exceptional characteristic of certail 
sorts of action; but, speaking generally, all of our actioy 
physical and mental, is either wholly habitual or saved 
from the habitual only by the slightest departure or moi 
fication. The child begins as a little nervous mechanis 
and gradually modifies his action into stereotyped forms 
which persist for a greater or less period and are agi! 
further modified and further modified in an almost inte 
minable series, according as satisfactions are discoverdl 
in connection with these successive modifications. T# 
result is that almost all of man’s reactions to situations# 
stimuli which repeat themselves at all frequently ( 
they comprise most of man’s actions) are really matte! 
of habit. The child begins with a few instinctive mow 
ments of lips, tongue, and throat, and develops habits 
making sounds to express his meaning. Those sounds g™ 
ually become specialized into habits of connecting certs? 
words with separate objects or ideas. Later, he puts 
or more words together into phrases. Still later hes 
habits of making complete sentences, and it may be mss 
years before he groups these sentences into paragraph 
either in his thought or in his writing. a

TYPICAL FORMS OF ORGANIZED EXPERIENCE 37 
What, then, is the function of these automatic tendencies 
of our nature? Evidently to release attention from these 
oft-repeated sorts of action, thus making it possible for — 
attention to focus on the new or peculiar elements of the 
situation or the response. Assome one has said, “ Habit is 
alubricant which reduces the friction of life to a point where 
progress is possible.” Incidentally it minimizes the de- 
gree of attention, and diminishes fatigue, simplifies action, 
makes it more accurate, and reduces the time and energy - 
necessary for adjustments. The beginner at tennis tries 
to focus his attention everywhere. He tires much more 
quickly than one accustomed to playing. His move- 
ments include many in excess of the requirement. . He 
gradually becomes more accurate, and able to hit a swift 
ball which would earlier have eluded him. As a result. of 
this form of organization of experience, then, adjustments 
to environment are made which form not only the basis of 
further modification but serve to free consciousness of 
those idea-complexes which would otherwise:be of little 
tervice and might even obstruct its effective functioning. 
8. Seeking automatisms is fundamental to teaching. — 
The distinction between the idea and the habit is not in its 
fundamental aspects hard to make; and yet it has not 
been made, despite the fact that it is of the utmost impor- 
tance. The methods by which an idea is learned and a 
habit gained are distinctly different. As will appear more 
tlemly when the differences are brought out in relief, multi- 
Dlicity of association is the basis for one, and invariability 
the path of repetition the basis for the other. 
lf this is so, it is evident that the teacher should adapt 
himself to the situation. The born teacher has done so 
§utomatically to some degree. Others have asked them- 
‘elves mentally some such question as this: “Now I 
ve taught this point, must I drill on it?” Jf they
-P-A-G-E-54
38 HABIT-FORMATION 
thought that the child might forget the point, and would 
suffer from that fact, or if they thought he would lox 
much time through failure to get facility in using it, 
they gave him drill, often of the most formal and useles 
sort, not calculated even to secure the habit they wee 
blindly groping toward. The habit side of the teachers 
work should be recognized and definitely planned for. 
After the subject-matter of a lesson (or series of Jessom 
making a unit) has been determined, the first great prt 
ciple of teaching is, analyze the subject-matter and dda 
mine what elements in it are to become habitual. Whereve 
continued problems of discipline arise in teaching, they also 
are caused by the lack of certain automatisms. In 
instance the whole situation must be taken into accoutt 
and analyzed in a search for habit. When found, the 
formation of the habit will solve the problem of discipli¢ 
with an effectiveness not to be found in mere decrees # 
penalties. Failure to distinguish in teaching betwet 
knowledge and conduct, between idea and habit, is equiv 
lent to forsaking all claims to scientific teaching and takilé 
chances with the empiricist. The important points to be 
considered in making this analysis are carefully set f 
in the following chapter. 
9. A point of difficulty. — The only point of difficull 
is in those instances where that which begins as idé 
gradually becomes automatic and so ends as habit. Th 
case of the child who has learned the use and sound | 
most of the letters, but has never heard the alphabet sai 
will serve to illustrate. He is told that it is a list of all 
letters, and the list is given. The child gets first an idesd 
an alphabet as a vague string of letters, and then of 
particular kind of alphabet. He sets to work and tries# 
commit it to memory. The first time he goes through # 
he has an idea, When he is first able to say it all {re
-P-A-G-E-55
TYPICAL FORMS OF ORGANIZED EXPERIENCE 39 
memory, it may be considered an idea, though the a-b-c 
part of it at least may have become automatic by that 
time. When he gets it so thoroughly as to require little 
or no conscious attention, the whole thing has become 
practically one habit, which may or may not be ideated, 
as we shall presently see. 
Consequently, a second principle is already allied with 
the first, where habits are found to be a part of the require- 
ment of the subject-matter. Determine whether the habit 
isan automatism which will be hit upon by the child as a 
result of his own initiative and experimental efforts, or im- 
plies a definite idea which must first appear in consciousness 
before it can be transformed into a fixed automatic process. 
That is, determine whether the method of imparting the 
idea must precede the method of establishing the habit. 
Most of the habits gained in school, aside from those which 
are disciplinary, belong to subject-matter and are of the 
type. 
To. The combination involved in idea-habits. — For con- 
Venience, such a habit will be called an idea-habit, because 
getting it involves using the method of getting an idea and 
often of forming a habit. Any adult can easily get an 
of what is meant when it is suggested that he repeat 
the alphabet backward. If he tries saying it, however, 
*e will soon see the difference in the reaction between an 
Wea and a habit. If he persists until he can say it back- 
ward with as much facility as he can forward, then he 
Wil have formed an idea-habit. 
4 1. The difficulty not practical. — It is evident that 
must be some point in the above process where it is 
ard to say whether what is learned is a habit or an idea. 
for ae seem to be a difficulty, but it is really negligible 
in dcr feasons. In the first place, there is no difficulty 
‘ciding whether a given idea or combination of ideas
-P-A-G-E-56
40 HABIT-FORMATION 
should come automatically or be worked out when needed 
by the child. If the methods of engendering habits are 
either different from or supplementary to those employed 
in imparting knowledge, the necessity from the stand 
point of economy, that the teacher know which he has to 
teach, is evident. In thesecond place, the transition from 
idea to habit in the child’s mind may involve a theoretical 
point of difficulty, but the advantage of distinguishing 
between green and blue is not vitiated because there i 
theoretically a part of the spectrum intervening whic 
cannot with assurance be named either green or blue. In 
short, neither the child himself nor the teacher has aly 
use to make of the point of transition. The habit is tobe 
fully established. The success of both teacher and child 
depends upon and is tested in the case of habit by the 
automatic character of what the child has learned. Cons 
quently, the advantages of the distinction are offset by 
practical disadvantage. 
12. Practice in making the distinction desirable. —4 
little practice will enable students during observation 
to determine (quite successfully) which the teacher 3 
working for. A careful examination of the course 
study also should be made to determine just where habits 
are desired and where ideas. Some practical work in bot 
directions, until the distinction clears itself in the mind, if 
desirable at this point. This will serve also to emphasi# 
the usefulness of the following chapter. . 
The teacher will of course have abundant opportuniti@ 
for practice both in making the distinction and in th 
application of the appropriate method. 
13. Automatisms involved in courses of study. — Cour 
of study should also be searched for indications of the 
of habit which will be indicated, if at all, by some exp!

sion pointing out the need of repetition or practice, 
including the word “‘drill.”+ With the development of a 
methodology of habit and therefore of drill, it is hoped that 
in courses of study much more assistance may be given 
the teacher in regard to this drill work, that attention may 
be called to the various automatisms or habits sought, 
and suggestions may be made for securing them as a part 
of the child’s training.” : 
This, then, is the first important distinction for the 
teacher to make after he has reached a decision as to the 
general nature of what is to be taught. Given. a lesson, 
does it involve or lead toward a habit, or does the lesson 
imply that an idea is to be gained? If it implies a habit, 
then the question is whether it is an idea-habit or a mere 
sutomatism.? With these distinctions cleared, method is

14. Summary. — The child’s experience brings to him 
a heterogeneous mass of impressions. From them, facts, 
truths, circumstances, events, principles, qualities of ob- 
jects, and so forth, are learned; and with these a goodly 
array of actions is either involved or becomes associated. 
In the past the educational theorists have set forth 
knowledge in one form or another as the common genus 
in the variety of experience. But knowledge is too narrow; 
it does not include elements of skill, such as accuracy, 
facility, and efficiency in general. Knowledge and ability 
to use knowledge are not synonyms. We do not know 
how we perform certain acts. We merely know we cat 
performthem. The philosophers and educational theorists 
have been generally silent as to methods of teaching the 
organizations which should be termed rather of skill than 
of knowledge, though these constitute a large part of edu 
cational procedure. 
The word “idea” appropriately denominates one kind 
of organization, while the word “habit” effectually covers 
the other type of experience. Attitudes, appreciations, 
impressions, and the like are vague terms whose meaning 
can only be rationally determined in terms either of idea of 
habit or both. The term “skill,” though implying habit, 
is not synonymous with it. Skill is more limited in appli- 
cation and often implies ideation. 
Accordingly, the first great principle in scientific teach 
ing is to analyze the subject-matter and determine whst 
elements in it are to become habitual. Experiences may 
the idea of his habit and on occasion the definite form of reactiov 
as well. A man may not know that he has formed a habit of | 
squinting one eye when he looks off into the distance. Some one 
may call his attention to it, and thereafter he may catch himself 
squinting. Then for a while at least he may have both the habit 
and an idea of the habit he has formed, though he may wish, per 
haps, to inhibit it, as in this case.
-P-A-G-E-59
TYPICAL FORMS OF ORGANIZED EXPERIENCE 43 
become amalgamated into an idea-complex, and later the 
idea may itself become stereotyped and automatic. That 
is, it becomes a habit and may be termed an idea-habit. 
For such the methods of imparting ideas must precede the 
methods of establishing habits. The fact that there is 
theoretically a transition point is practically no disad- 
vantage, since, if an idea or an act is to become habitual, 
there should be no attempt just to cross the transition 
point; the habit must be well established. 
A little practice will make the distinction easier in its 
application. Courses of study should indicate points where 
automatisms are to be secured, and offer suggestions for 
getting them. In any case, the courses as outlined must 
bestudied for the habits involved. 
Given an idea, a habit, or an idea-habit, the method of 
Procedure may be outlined. Without such a distinction, 
No method is possible.

CHAPTER IV : 
Tun DirFERENCE BETWEEN Hasrrs anp Ipzas” | 
“Education is naught but the formation of habits.” 
— RovssEav. 
In the type of organized experience studied in th 
previous chapter, the terms “idea” and “ habit” were used 
in a broader way thanis authorized by most psychologists, 
and with a significance not greatly at variance with pop 
lar usage. 
1. Nature and definition of an idea. — When in ordinaty 
experience a person burns himself on a hot stove or radise 
tor, he might say, “I had an idea that it was hot, but ™ idea that it was so hot as to burn me.” One may sf; 
“I have no idea what I shall do to-morrow,” or, “MY 
idea is that no president should serve a third tem!’ 
or that “all children have to be vaccinated before the] 
can attend school, because mine were.” An old ides af 
heaven pictured it as a city whose streets were p® 
with gold, whose buildings were studded with precio® 
stones, and so forth. This is.a popular use of the sword 
“idea,” which covers practically the whole gamut of whet 
the psychologist considers under cognition, with the pos* 
ble exception of sensation. An idea must be more or le# 
definite. One may speak of having a vague, indefinite 
sation of strain, or of nausea, but it would be a contradie 
tion to speak of having a vague, indefinite idea of a cert 
strain, or instance of nausea. As soon as this vaguex® 
changes to definiteness, we may and do speak of having ® 
idea of the strain or the nausea. 
Just at this point, unfortunately, where the pedagos” 
44 :
-P-A-G-E-61
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HABITS AND IDEAS 45 
may very profitably join hands with popular usage, the 
psychologists have in the past, for reasons of their own, dis- 
sented, using the term ‘“‘idea’’ with widely varied connota- 
tion. Héffding, however, divides the section of his psychol- 
ogy dealing with cognition into two main divisions, sensation 
and ideation, the latter evidently covering all forms of 
cognition except sensation. Miss Calkins, in her psychol- 
ogy, states that “the word ‘idea,’ is appliéd to any complex 
experience regarded as one term in a succession.” Locke 
emphasized the cognition side when he referred to “idea” 
as that term which he thought “to stand best for whatever 
is the object of the understanding when one thinks.” ' 
This broader usage more closely corresponds to popular 
Usage, and means to the average teacher what it seems to 
mean. Consequently I have used the term in this sense, 
and therefore define an idea as any definite cognitive 
functioning, : ; 
Ideas are of varying complexity. Brooklyn is to most 
People a less complex idea than the idea, New York 
Gity, or New York State, or the United States. Various 
Writers have used the terms “idea-complex,” “ idea- 
mas,” “thought-mass,” “ systems,” “ circles of thought,” 
“thought-cyeles,” “system of the prevalent disposition,” 
te., where no reference is made to any special organization 
of the subsidiary idea involved in the larger whole. The 
term “idea,” as here used, is sufficiently broad to include 
the elaborate and complex idea-mass, as well as the simpler 
and more direct experience. 
2. Nature and definition of habit.— Habit, on the con- 
trary,is popularly used in an extremely narrow way, not 
that its meaning is different from that which has been im-~ 
plied in this book, but rather that the application of the 
term is limited to an infinitesimal part of the actual ex- 
'“Tntroduction to Psychology,” p. 150. New York, 1906.
-P-A-G-E-62
46 HABIT-FORMATION 
periences to which it properly applies. The uneducated 
person thinks of his eating and drinking and smoking in 
terms of habit, and of his real or fancied personal peculiari- 
ties as habits. He does not think of his recreations, skating, 
swimming, hitting and catching a ball, his business caleula- 
tions, and reactions as habits. Nor does he consider the 
movements of his eyes, the manner of reading a paper, 
appreciating pictures, jokes, and architecture, and much 
less his religious and political beliefs as habits. To be sur, 
many of these ought not to be purely habitual, and often 
are not, but habit enters in to a degree unappreciated except 
by the students of habit. Rousseau! said, “ Education is 
certainly nothing but the formation of habits.” 
Even the psychologists have often made the serious mis- 
take of classifying habit in the realm of volition, neglecting 
its equally potent force in cognition, feeling, and evel 
volition itself. Even where they have defined it as a.state 
of mind or body in which acts previously. performed-tead 
to_repeat themselves in exactly the same way,]they limit. 
ittothe body and external action. It is only comparatively 
recently that memory, at least’ where it is secured by repeti- 
tion, has been thought of as habit. Surely it is as much of 8 
habit for a child to secure as an automatism, 6 x 9 = 54, 
even if there is no perceptible external action (whatever 
the motor tendencies), as it is to take his pen in his right 
hand as he starts to write. 
Stout treats of habit in two ways: (1) as in process of 
formation, (2) as fully established. In this second sense, 
as a fully established organization of experience, habit is, 
then, following closely Maher’s definition,? an acquired

includes t s which “have us,” and the habits “we

tual or central in character? All training and all efficiency 
are based on habit. Spontaneity or involved accommoda-_ 
tion, in the main, functions only as accessory to and built 
upon previously acquired habit, and as itself contributing 
to further improvement in adjustment, which, if perma- 
nent, is habitual. :

specific, at least in the reaction to which “ hébit” 
is applied, that no occasion has arisen terms 33 
“habit-masses”’ to correlate with “ idea-masses.” Ideas 
differ infinitely in complexity. Habits differ only to a very 
limited degree in the length or amount of what is considered 
as one habit. 
3- Philosophical objections answered. — The pedagogue 
has not merely to reconcile these uses of terms, but the 
philosopher interposes his objection that ideas and habits 
are treated here as though they were real entities or ob 
jective existences. He seems to be right; ideas do not 
exist except while we are having them; habits do not 
\ exist except while some act is being performed in a habitual 
way. But on the other hand, the following illustration 
may clear up the situation. I left my watch the other 
day at the jeweler’s to be cleaned. Several times in the 
next few days I caught myself either feeling for it in the 
accustomed place, or about to do so. Is not this tendency 
of mind to reach toward my vest pocket upon occasion 8 
real as the watch itself? May it not be treated as an exist 
ent somewhat? Moreover, is not the idea I have of my 
watch as real as the watch itself? Does not one whole 
school of philosophers regard the idea as the reality? The 
watch does not function except as I look at it, hear it 
or handle it. Is it unreal because it ceases to functiod 
when no one is thinking about it? 
Again, a curious inconsistency lies in the fact that the 
philosopher seems willing to acquiesce in this objective 
treatment of habit, but balks at it as applied to the ides | 
Surely the idea is in essence no more and no less a, functiod 
than habit. If not, where does the idea-habit come i! 
All functioning implies something to function and cond 
tions under which the functioning takes place. |
-P-A-G-E-65
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HABITS AND IDEAS 49 
There is a further answer to the philosopher’s objection 
which might be made. This book could have been written, 
and the functional point of view now rendering so much aid 
to the pedagogue could have been preserved throughout. 
The difficulty was simply that it was impossible to preserve 
it without a very frequent use of circuitous phrases which, 
though more satisfying to the philosopher-psychologist 
at the present moment, would end in a desert of words 
which would render the book unserviceable. at precisely 
the point where I trust it may prove to be of genuine 
value. As long as something must exist which corresponds 
tither to what we call ideas, or to what we denominate habit, 
there can be no serious objection to ridding ourselves of 
verbal incumbrances and circumlocution by referring to 
these phenomena, that is, ideas and habits, as though they 
existed, : 
4. A psychological objection. — Another type of psychol- 
gist raises an objection which is more serious. He claims 
that habit enters into all thinking, that all forms of cognition 
ure largely infusions of habit, each experience combining 
With this fundamental habit-basis certain elements, develop- 
Ments, ramifications, adaptations, or superimposed: associa- 
tions. The writer believes that this is true, — that, in 
general, being given sight impressions, we see what we are in 
the habit of seeing, that we remember what we are in the 
habit of temembering, imagine, judge, and reason very 
uch 48 we are in the habit of imagining, judging, and 
Tasoning. But even the acknowledgment of the complex- 
Hy in eognition does not invalidate or devitalize the utility 
of the distinction between idea and habit, since whatever 
may be the elements involved, either the superimposed 
‘Sociations or developments predominate in the attention 
a the guise of an idea, or they are unnoticed, and the 
| "perience is therefore dominated by habitual reactions. 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
50 HABIT-FORMATION 
It must be admitted that this difficulty is perplexing to the 
teacher. It has already been referred to in the case of idex 
habits, and will be again. One of the reasons for entering 
in this chapter into the detailed study of this difference is 
not only to show the basis for the principles derived, but 
also to enable the teacher to distinguish between that which 
is predominantly idea or predominantly habit. In variow 
parts of the book occasion has arisen to refer to the difficulty 
in the hope of removing it. In the writer’s experience, aud 
that of others who have tried it, few cases offer any rel 
difficulty after some practice. 
Even though these words (ideas and habits) were denied 
me in the sense I have used them, I should still have to insist 
on the distinction, for practical purposes in teaching, be 
tween that which may be described as a relatively compl 
organization which is automatic and consists of units fune 
tioning in a fixed succession (habit) and that which rr 
resents an organization of associated experiences, whichis 
regardable from many points of view and is capable of it 
definite addition to and arrangement or rearrangement 
its unitary elements (idea).! 
The contrast of definitions in the preceding paragraphs 
however, fails to bring out into very positive relief impo 
tant differences which will appear upon close observatios 
~~ differences which will also serve as a basis for importatt 
principles and to clarify a distinction otherwise hard # 
make.? |

« g, Habit an automatism.—The first essential difference 
is that habit is automatic in character. os 
It is an automatism.’ It is self-moving in a definite 
direction. Its initial features suggest only one set of conse- 
quent features. If a person starts to lace up his shoes, he 
will not stop until he has finished, unless interrupted by 
some new contingency. On the other hand the’ initial 
phases of an idea are not followed by any given consequents 
directly. Ideas may be variously suggested, interrupted, 
and obstructed. If a woman is shown a new bonnet, little 
automatism on her part is necessarily involved. It-is im- 
possible to say what part of the bonnet she will look at 
first, or how she willexamine it. The second, third, and any 
other subsequent times she sees or thinks of it she may do 
80 in different ways and from new points of view. Various 
experiences are called up at different times. Now one 
hame or another occurs to her, under changed conditions 
diferent people are thought of as wearing that style, and 
0 forth. One set, automatic kind of reaction’appears in 
lacing up the shoes, while in the case of the bonnet no set 
form of reaction appears, but the person gets an idea now of 
quire the habit of subordinating his likes and dislikes to the attain- 
ment of arational object.” .. . ‘Passive habit teaches us to bear 
the vicissitudes of life with such composure that we shall hold our 
ground against them, being always equal to ourselves, and that 
We shall not allow our power of acting to be paralyzed through 
ny mutation of fortune.” Harris, in the Introduction of Rosen-

persons wearing it, now of the occasions or times of the year 
when it is most suitable, — all according to the point of 
view or the general mental tendency at the time. 
6. Habit serial, ideas approachable from many point 
of view. — This illustration brings us to the seeond impor 
tant difference. Habit is always a serial affair. Even 
when in its simplest form of a single unitary experience, 
always suggests a related experience. The swinging back 
and forth of the hand until the shoe is tied is not only 
automatic but ‘represents a series of subsidiary reaction. 
No such series appears in the consideration of the bonneh 
Not only is the experience as a whole lacking in settled 
automatic action, but, even granted an established aveni 
of approach, it is almost immediately forsaken, interrupted, 
crossed or recrossed. 
The elements in the habit series may be little separ 
habits combined into a more complex one, just as buttomilg 
one’s waistcoat must be a more complex habit than jut 
buttoning one button, though that in itself would be a habit 
as soon as it is done automatically. The conscious 
of finishing with one button acts as a stimulus for startivg 
on the next. An idea, on the other hand, may be ¢ 
up automatically and yet itself not be a habit. Thus# 
certain sound may suggest automatically a whistle But

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HABITS AND IDEAS 838 
7. Habit’s function to preserve unchanged, the function 
of the idea to adapt itself. —- In the third place, habit rep- 
tesents a conserving tendency of mental life. That is, 
after it has once been established, it tends to remain un- 
changed, always produced in response to the same or 4 
similar suggesting stimulus, always characterized by the 
same reaction. Desirable forms of action thus become 
permanent. They persist, though there is a period during 
the inception of the habit when there is a certain amount 
of experimentation and an attempt to improve on it. It 
is these attempts to improve which put a good golfer “off 
his game.” When some mere chance variation of his 
stroke becomes habit without his noticing it, it may take 
him weeks to get back to where he was before he made this 
unfortunate attempt to improve. The habits once estab- 
lished beyond this experimenting stage, become fixed, 
and change only as new conditions compel new adaptations. 
The function of habit, then, is to conserve in its original form 
4 definite reaction. There is a constant warfare between 
the forces of habituation and those of experiment, adaptation, 
or, as Baldwin? would say, accommodation. But let habit 
Once gain the upper hand, and experiment soon retires 
from the field, though seldom finally. 
The idea, on the other hand, has just the opposite function. 
Its usefulness consists in its ability to adapt itself and be- 
Come modified in accordance with additional points of view. 
It may be combined in synthesis with other ideas, or it may 
be resolved into its elements by analysis, or it may be fused 
with other similar ideas, or applied to some given situation 
either by deduction or analogy. In short, its very function 
8 to change, to be modified. Of what use would our idea

mobiling, sailing, be if we were obliged always to think of 
them in exactly the same way, from the same point of view, 
including just so much and excluding always the same 
amount. The truth is, such words represent, to use Her- 
bart’s figure, masses of ideas relative to which we have 
accumulated some knowledge, and hope to get more. We 
may with comparative freedom modify them, add new 
material, subtract wrong impressions, and in general organ- 
ize the ideas'we have into some useful form of practical 
import to us, even if it be of no more satisfying kind 
than that teachers cannot afford to neglect the study of 
school sanitation. 
8. Habit disregards detail and feeling, ideas accentuate 
both. -~ In the fourth place, as a habit becomes more and 
more fixed, we lose sight of the details involved. Think 
of the detail a pianist must master in the way of smaller 
ideas and habits of manipulating the keys. But in render 
ing a difficult but ennobling piece of music, all of these yea? 
and steps of practice are lost to consciousness in the enjoy- 
ment of the harmonies now easily rendered, as symbolized 
by the little dots on the lines of the staff, which form the 
stimuli that keep the automatic processes going right. But 
in the course of the practice there must have been many 4 
detail to learn or smaller automatism to acquire before the 
mind was freed for more involved functioning. With this 
disregard of detail the feeling element tends to fade out, the 
enthusiasm of the boy’s first successes at swimming fades 
away into the staid matter-of-courseness which chat 
acterizes his swimming in later life. Our disappointment, 
too, over failure to perform long-tried tasks begins to low 
its vigor in the late efforts and may even sink into a dreary 
sort of satisfaction in the mere effort, regardless of results. 
Here, again, in both phases the idea is radically differenh

our ideas. A vague idea of New York City will prove 
useless in assisting a person to find his way around the city. 
The more details the better the organization may be, and 
the better the organization the more completely it must 
cover the details. Even an abstraction loses its vitality 
and becomes mere empty verbiage if completely isolated: - 
from its data. To one unacquainted with electricity it 
is not particularly edifying to know the principle that the 
strength of the current varies directly as the electromotive 
force and inversely as the resistance.’ , 
In contrast with habit, the feeling accessory of the idea 
tends to rouse itself or vary, the longer the idea is in focus, 
a new aspects strengthen or weaken the prevailing mood. 
A small boy may hitherto have left the impression on his 
teacher that he was “mean” and wanted to annoy her, 
when quite unexpectedly and willingly he puts himself out 
to do her a special kindness. The idea of this act might at 
first give her a feeling of pleasure, but the contrast with other 
acts of a different nature may lead her to other feelings. 
Then there may ensue an oscillation back and forth in con- 
sciousness now of thought of the old acts and now of the new, 
tach with its appropriate accompaniment of feeling, until 
‘The fact that this principle may be used automatically by an 
*iPert in electricity as an idea-habit, and that many concepts may be used practically as idea-habits does not invalidate the distine- 
tion. When ideated as objects of attention, they carry with them ln lnanifold of association, suggestion, ete., 4.e. both detail and ing,

the teacher has finally organized the new act as representa. 
tive of the child’s real feeling, and those others as an outcome 
of an instinct to tease or of some other native propensity— 
good in itself but often ill adjusted. 
9. Habit minimizes attention and fatigue, ideas increase 
the amount of attention and fatigue. — With these differ 
ences in detail and feeling a fifth characteristic of the habit, 
as distinguished from the idea, is closely connected. In 
case of a habit, if the attention strays, a resulting movement 
or even mental reaction is likely to proceed as well and very 
likely even better than if it had remained definitely centered 
on the reaction. For the whole tendency of habit is to 
release the attention while at the same time increasing 
the accuracy and reducing the fatigue characterizing the 
movement. An engineer just struggling with the problem 
of starting a new fifty-horse-power marine engine proved 
to be an interesting subject for observation. He knew bis 
engine and what was to be done, but there was still just 
enough of the knack to be acquired to make large drafts 
on his attention, and the release of the starting lever 1 
quired an accuracy in the time of the movement to slip itof 
that demanded the utmost gui vive. The resultant fatigue 
in the muscular effort was considerable; but in a short time 
a few turns and a little attention sufficed. He had gained 
the “knack.” An habitual act calls for less attention and 
therefore entails less fatigue than the same act would if 
not habitual. Where ideas influence movement, they do it 
directly through habit or by minor alterations or modifies 
tions of previous habit paths. If effort is required, 98 8 
usual, to keep the idea in the focus of consciousness

fatigue is necessitated, and the more attention is demanded.

pended by the engineer of many months’ experience with 
the same engine. 
10, Habit implies repetition, an idea may be gained 
through one experience. — Sixthly, habit implies repetition, 
practice, traversing over and over the same neural path.

to write is told that he must write with his right band, and

An idea, whether it be gained more directly through the 
medium of the senses, or through judgment or reasoning,

ence only. The victim of a railroad accident needs no

ample, a boy may form the habit of always hanging bis 
hat on a certain nail in school without necessarily develop- 
ing the habit of hanging it on a certain nail at home. On 
the other hand, it may suggest and in time produce the fixed 
reaction at home. So, too, a habit of keeping papers clean 
may suggest to the boy the desirability of washing his 
hands morning and noon before school. Washing his 
hands ought very readily to suggest washing his face as 
well, and so the habit is extended to several different 
actions. It is not likely that it will lead to the habit of 
cleaning his nails or washing his ears, unless by a very 
gradual process and added suggestion. Some of our psy- 
chologists in their perhaps justified opposition to formal 
discipline in theory seem to have lost sight of this possibility 
of the use of neurone pathways in common and the possibl- 
ity that by suggestion one pathway may set into action ® 
similar one in a new but similar situation. This is especially 
important in its bearings on habit, as implied both in moral 
conduet and school discipline, and will later be taken w 
again. 
The point that needs emphasis and has perhaps been ove 
worked in exceptional cases is that habits always apply 
single paths of reaction. They are specific, not get 
Moreover, they can be regarded from only one point of view,

said of Russell Sage that he consulted a lawyer as to his 
chance of winning a certain case; the lawyer listened to him 
and said, “Yes, you have a very good case there.” “Thank 
you,” said the shrewd financier; “that’s the other man’s 
side of it.’ There are usually many points of view in- © 
volved in ideas, whether they be derived from legal cases, 
objects presented to the senses, or plays of imagination and 
reasoning in general. Moreover, the point of view modifies 
sometimes seriously the nature of the idea; and it requires 
much shrewdness to keep free from bias or prejudice in 
favor of the point of view most acceptable. 
12. Direct reflex and instinctive basis for habit, none for 
ideas. —The remaining distinction (the eighth) between 
babits and ideas is orie which is of pronounced significance in 
teaching. It consists in the fact that there is an extensive 
- background of reflex and instinctive hereditary possibilities of teaction, which form the basis of the child’s first move- 
ments, On these or out of these he gradually develops all 
the subsequent special habits or habit combinations so nec- 
cessary and useful in enabling him to adapt his reactions to 
the varying complexity of his environment. Thus, out of 
the general exuberance of hand, leg, and body movements 
made when the child sees a bright object, he gradually 
comes to select the specific movement of stretching out his 
Tight hand and grasping until this becomes habitual when- 
ever a sufficiently attractive incentive is offered.

Periods of time are involved, although at any given moment it has a

the form of the chameleon, which is specific any time after it has 
Matured.

generally agreed among psychologists that there am m 
native or innate ideas. Nor is there an original, ready-mak 
function by which ideas may come to consciousness. Bit 
the same background of reactions fundamental to the devd 
opment of habit is also fundamental in that it not only fu. 
nishes data for the interpretation of the outside world bi 
none the less for the interpretation of itself. Thus Herbartt 
ethical idea of benevolence is easily accounted for, if itisat 
mitted that any form of reaction instinctive or otherwisemy 
in part at least be brought to consciousness as knowledgt 
first of all, as an act, perhaps, but sooner or later as 4% 
action having certain qualities (in this case a feeling quality) 
in common with other reactions. Our feelings and our 
actions become (or may become) therefore conscious & 
periences of the cognitive type, on the basis of which ne 
intellectual experiences are gained by analysis of ot 
combination of elements, or by mingling analytic and 9* 
thetic processes. 
13. Restatement of the eight points of difference.\—T

This, however, is not saying that the ideas are habits. Jut# 
long as you have such a complexity of habits involved in the iat 
that at different times they function in different orders ' 
varying limits, the total consciousness involves no such br 
character as we have postulated for habit, and the complee | 
maticity of the idea is not assured. When an idea reaches & 
in consciousness where it is serial and fixed as a single autom 
from beginning to end, it has been transformed into 4 habit. a 
Of course, too, this automaticity, serialness, and fixed 
habit are necessarily more or less relative, that is, ideas may 
them to some degree, but habits must have them in high if 
The reason for making the distinction is its. great important?

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HABITS AND IDEAS 61 
following contrast may serve as a summary of the 
distinctions emphasized: {Habit is automatic, serial, and 
fixed. Habit disregards details with their feeling accom- 
paniments. Habit minimizes attention and fatigue. Habit 
implies repetition, is specific, and is built up on a reflex 
and instinctive basis of action. ° 
Ideas, on the other hand, are not automatic, except 
as habit enters into them. Ideas imply a mass of smaller 
elements not regarded serially but according to point of 
view. Ideas function only by change, modification, analy- 
sis, and synthesis. Ideas emphasize the detail and also 
the feeling element. Ideas increase the amount of con- 
scious attention, effort, and fatigue. Ideas may be gained: 
through one experience, are considered and modified from 
many points of regard, and are not based on any native 
knowledge. 
14. Principles of education involved in these differences. — 
We are now in a position to consider more definitely the 
fundamental differences in method which are necessitated by 
these differences in the nature of the two functions. We 
may think of the typical habit as analogous to a row of 
dominoes standing on end, each successively ready to 
topple over its neighbor in its fall, or as a. series of digits 
intheir conventional order, and the typical idea as like a spi- 
der’s web or the jumbled mass of streets in an old European 
town, The row of dominoes and the stereotyped order of 
digits stand for specific neural paths. Evidently, to get 
these neural pathways established, they must be traversed 
the teacher Teaching of the type to produce the most effective 
babi ‘tion is not calculated to produce the most efficient idea- 
tion, adaptability, or originality. The bringing to consciousness & 
complexity of associations as completely as possible is different 
| from bringing into play a muscular or mental series involving the 
| ninimum of consciousness. But these are the typical forms of 
‘tivity involved in the aims of teaching.
-P-A-G-E-78
62 HABIT-FORMATION 
again and again. As habit is to be automatic, self-carried, 
and fixed, repetition is again the essential. If habit is 
serial, the same elements should invariably precede the 
next in each case, and the habit may often be learned in 
sections. Since habits are fixed, care should be taken at 
the outset that the right ones be established, so that no u- 
learning or corrections need be made. If they tend to 
disregard details and the feeling accompaniments, let it be 
certain, before it is too late, that the function of the detail 
in making good adjustments and the function of feeling in 
warning against poor adjustments and guiding toward good 
ones have both served as fully as possible. If effort af 
attention is to be minimized, let it not be until the reaction is 
safely established in its most efficient form. Since habit is 
specific, any given habit should be the one adapted to the 
situation for which an adjustment is desired and not a blind 
attempt to make real some abstraction. And again, ina 
much as habit is based on reflex and instinctive activity, 
the nature of that basis and its usefulness deserve most 
careful study. 
The main point in the case of the idea must be, first of all, 
to add definitely to its nucleus; and secondly, to elaborate 
its elements into an orderly system. Also in ideation atte 
tion should be held more or less closely to its focus on the 
idea or its elements and associations. Detail and feeling 
in this idea-process must each continue to function fully. 
The idea must function as a whole, no matter what the 
outlying association may be that called the idea to consciour | 
ness, and the mind should be able to survey this idea from 
many other points of view than the first one suggested. 
Moreover, ideas must undergo a constant reconsideratiot, 
criticism, or tendency to revision, whether by way of addié 
or subtracting to the sum total of elements composé 
them or by way of reorganizing them into forms mom

mitable for purposes of adjustment or application. If 
effort of attention is desirable, the various incentives and 
aids to attention should bestudied. If fatigue is increased, 
greater precaution should be taken in exercises dealing 
with idea-getting, that the child may have the energy to — 
expend. 
15. Habit-getting as a sequel to idea-getting. — It must 
be borne in mind that these are distinctions which hold 
where the idea is essentially an idea and where the habitis — 
purely an automatism. Where an idea is to be transformed 
into a habit, the mental processes must begin with the 
Gualities of the idea, and later the qualities of habit will grow 
cut of it as the idea slowly crystallizes, loses its variability; 
fails to be analyzed or associated in manifold ways, be- 
comes serial and automatic. This process may take place 
on or extend over days, weeks, or years, according as its 
complexity and the opportunity for practice vary. In 
Sich a habit the methodology of the idea must precede and 
then be followed by the methodology of habit. Many a 
teacher has taken a period for bringing out an idea, followed 
up with exercises for home work, and devoted the next 
Petiod or more given that subject to drilling on it. without 
Slee being conscious that he first taught an idea and then 
tried to fix it as an automatism. : 
16. Transition of ideas into habits. —In many cases, 
however, the ideas are so easily and automatically * gained 
%8 to need no special emphasis on the method of acquiring

Merely the formation of certain habits. “Turn the handle

enough, but to do it soon enough and not too soon or to

tend to fall,’ and “keep pedaling.” Easy enough, to be 
sure, but it takes a long time to get the habit after the 
ideas are taught. To get the ideas is not the problem 
They will be gained automatically with any sort of teaching 
The habit is the difficult thing, and were it attended by 
oceasional unpleasantness, such as characterized first st 
tempts at riding the old-fashioned high wheel, or such # 
attends early endeavors to swim, the result would not be 
so readily attained. | 
Again, in the child’s early learning, which is almost wholl | 
habit-forming, the part played by the few hazy idess he 
may have succeeded in clearing up out of the mist of his 
experience is so limited, and the ideas are so detached am 
scrappy in character, that they are almost entirely neglig« 
ble, as far as his early efforts are concerned. 
17. Habits as precedent to ideas. — In general, man in bis 
development made a new adjustment, afterward found i 
satisfying, and endeavored to repeat the acts involved. It 
may have been a chance combination or a fortunate circu 
stance that suggested and provoked the original reactiot; 
but when the advance was attended by pleasurable feelitg 
or appreciative knowledge of the desirable attainment, # 
least the immediate antecedents of the action were in time | 
also enkindled with consciousness. Thus an act (it may 
be habitual) often becomes father to the idea, or eonscio’ 
knowledge thereof in its various phases. The child lear’ 
to walk and talk as complicated adjustments. long befot 
he has formed any idea of doing so or of the nature of the 
reactions he is making. The child’s first naughtiness #

ethically no worse than his first good acts. In both cases 
he reacts according to his inherited structure. He experi- 
ments unconsciously for better adaptations. Where the 
experiment results favorably, he is commended. Where it 
is unsatisfactory, he is condemned. Sin came into the 
world not as idea, but as adjustment. 
Since habit-forming, then, precedes idea-getting in the - 
child’s development, and since in a large percentage of cases 
the idea part of the more complicated habit-getting is 
acquired automatically, and furthermore since the methods 
of imparting ideas have already been treated in several 
books on general method,! it has seemed both logical and 
Practical first to set forth systematically this neglected field: 
in the science of education. Consequently the discussion 
of teaching as discipline and drill is made to precede that 
of teaching as instruction. , 
18. Summary. — An idea, as here defined, is any definite 
Product of cognition. This is not far from the popular usage 
af the term, and is in effect sanctioned by the usage of 
eminent psychologists. It is thus made to include not

thing to function. The complicated mingling of idea and 
habit and action is a more serious difficulty. It forces us to 
look for the predominantly automatic, and is the chief reason 
for making a detailed study of the distinction between idea 
and habit. 
Eight points of difference are noted: — 
(1) Habit is automatic or self-carrying, ideas are sub- 
ject to hesitation, obstruction, interruption, and varied 
suggestion. 
(2) Habit is serial; ideas function with features varioudy 
prominent and lacking in settled continuity. The habit 
series may involve lesser habits themselves serial in the 
elements comprising them. 
(8) Habits are the product of a conserving tendency, — 
are relatively fixed; the very function of the idea is t0 
modify and adjust itself to new experience and situations. 
(4) Habits tend to the disregard of and ideas to the 
emphasis of details and the feeling tone of experience 
The details are vital to the organization of ideas, but at 
in the way-of the finished organization of habit. 
(5) Habit minimizes conscious attention and fatigue 
The more involved and the less familiar an idea may be, the 
greater the amount of attention and of consequent fatigue 
necessary for complete functioning. 
(6) Habit is the product of repetition; ideas may b 
gained through a single experience. 
(7) Habits are always specific, although we may and do 
sometimes denominate as habit a whole class of similt 
automatisms. Ideas, even of concrete experiences, ae 
gained through the medium of similar past experiences ¥! 
which they are fused or classed, and in which the separalé 
experience often loses its identity, while consciousne# 
may be definitely focused on the total result. 
(8) Habit is developed out of native tendencies to sti

there are no native ideas. On the other hand, native re- 
actions may be brought to consciousness (ideated) and thus 
contribute indirectly to ideation, incidentally rendering 
these native tendencies doubly important. 
Certain typical sorts of procedure in method are plainly 
implied by the above comparison : — 
(1) Habit can become automatic, self-carried, and fixed 
only through repetition. 
(2) One member of the habit series must invariably (not 
intermittently) precede the next. Subsidiary habits, how- 
ever, may be gained before the including habit is sought. « 
lity Care should be taken that only right habits be estab- 
se 
(4) Detail and feeling are not to be lost until a satis- 
factory reaction has been made. 
(5) Effort of attention must not lapse so long as needed for correct, action. 
(8) No blind substitute for the specific reaction adequate 
tothe situation must be accepted. 
(7) The instinctive equipment of the child must be 
known, 
On the other hand, 
(1) Ideas must be increased by added association. 
(2) Their elements must be elaborated into a more or less 
orderly system. 
@) The idea should function as a whole, including its 
8 connections. 
(4) Ideas must be viewed from many points of view, must 
‘ndergo criticism and revision. :

lize into habits. In many instances the methodology of 
imparting ideas must therefore precede that of habit-getting, 
In fact, this must always be the case except in the numer 
ous instances where the ideas or the habits themselves are 
gained automatically. Many ideas are not grasped until 
the habits they represent have been established. 
The methodology of habit is a subject never before 
treated in detail.

CHAPTER V 
Tue Basis or Hasrr-FoRMATION 
“Habit, second nature? Habit is ten times nature.” - 
— Duke oF WELLINGTON, 
1, The development of habit from instinct. — Any one 
who has come into contact with infants has noticed how 
few, how crude, and how uncontrolled are their early types 
of movement. The baby sitting on the floor stretches his 
hands toward some alluring object. Venturing too far, 
he falls prostrate. As a result of his fall, however, he gets 
tear enough to touch the plaything sought. His success in 
teaching the toy leads him thereafter to repeat the same 
method of reaching for things, until he becomes quite profi- 
tient. The habit of stretching himself out on the floor 
hss developed out of the crude instinctive reaching) 
Later it may be noticed that sometimes, when he fails 
even by this method, he makes an involuntary movement of 
the knee and, putting his weight upon it, throws himself 
forward by chance at first, but soon automatically coming 
within range of the desired object. This may be the first 
form of creeping. Again instinct has become habit. This 
Phase of locomotion is gradually improved upon until it 
omes a fairly direct and effective means of moving about. 
But the development does not rest there. Before. long 
the child reaches instinctively for things above him. He 
seizes hold of the side of the crib or the side of a heavy chair, 
and pulls. This pulling is accompanied by reflex move- 
Ments of the feet. After a number of efforts the feet reach 
4 position favorable to the getting-up process, and after 
Many struggles with combined pulling of arms and straight-

ening of legs, the baby stands. The fortunate combination 
is afterward repeated and soon becomes a matter of cours, 
that is, of habit. Soon the standing is itself varied by 
various instinctive movements, such as jumping up and 
down in glee, moving slightly back and forward, stepping 
off to the side, and turning round. These begin as very 
tentative modifications of the act of standing, but are 
slowly extended according as they accomplish desirable 
results, until finally the baby walks. 
One little girl, a year old, was able to shake her head very 
proficiently from right to left in imitation of her parents 
but her efforts to imitate the up-and-down (bowing) move 
ment resulted only in the twisting of the head to the right 
and left, possibly a little obliquely and with nothing like the 
freedom with which she executed the “no” movement. 4 
month later, as a result of watching a toy goose that swung 
its head vertically, she developed the ability to move het 
own head correspondingly. Thus the instinctive, aga 
under favoring circumstances, has become habitual move 
ment. So, too, in handling a book the child begins by vey 
crudely fumbling at the pages, but gradually more and more 
facility is gained until the process of turning leaves has bee 
relegated almost entirely to the automatic. . 
What is the secret of this modification? In a word, itié

cannot help noticing and remembering distinctively pleat 
ant and unpleasant experience. The pleasant he notice 
and endeavors to continue. The unpleasant he notes bit 
tries to avoid. In learning to reach, to creep, to stand, 
to walk, or to nod, habits have been formed from combined 
native and acquired tendencies, Given a specific sort of 
situation, the habit reaction follows mechanically. Thatit 
in each ease a particular situation has become associated 
with a definite reaction. The resultant satisfaction, esp

cially since it leads to the repetition of the connection, is 
agreat factor in developing the association. : 
These habits are representative of hundteds of habits 
formed in a similar manner during infancy, in course of 
school life, through youth or adolescence, and to a limited 
extent even in later life. One’s slant in handwriting, form 
of signature, choice of words, devices in using implements 
or performing various acts, — all represent in some degree 
at least instinctive or chance variations from established 
forms of movement. The result in each case is habit. 
2. The development of habit out of habit. — Continuing 
the illustrations above, it is plain that modification does 
Rot cease when an instinctive has been transformed into 
anhabitual movement. Indeed, it has already been insisted~ 
that these modifications are made very gradually but 
progressively, so that instinct appears, strictly speaking, only * 
at the beginning. All the rest of the modification is from 
one habit to another, though new instinctive tendencies are 
often combined with these habits in the new adjustment. 
Instinctive stretching out of hands leads to habitual reach- 
ing and grasping. Instinctive leg-and-arm movements com- 
bine in habits of creeping. Instinctive pulling up results 
Da habit of standing, and soon of balancing. The latter - 
8 modified into various habits of walking, runuing, side- 
stepping, jumping, dancing, skating, and so forth. Pro- 
fessor Thorndike thus formulates the principle—“ In any 
&ven situation the thoughts, feelings, and acts manifested 
will be those to which instinctive tendencies, or capacities, 
and also previously formed habits impel one.” * : 
Another remarkable instance of the gradual modifica- 
ton and ramification of instinct into habits is furnished by 
seer Thorndike, “Elements of Psychology,” pp. 199-204.

language. Here the instinctive elements are practically 
unrecognizable in the complex of linguistic abilities shown 
by the child even of school age. The child’s first instinctive 
babblings become modified into words used habitually asa 
means of expressing certain ideas. These words gradually 
combine themselves into phrases and sentences, according to 
certain habitual forms which are found to convey meaning, 
and hence to give satisfaction. It is hard to recognize the 
instinctive babblings of the child in the forceful and 
finished appeal of the skilled public speaker. They have 
been selected and eombined in thousands of ways which 
have in turn been re-selected and recombined again and 
again into the wonderfully involved forms of a well-devel- 
oped language. The basis at the beginning was instinct; 
later it became almost exclusively habit.

3. Nature of instinct.— Instincts have been defined 
as guiding impulses which are native and aid the organism 
in adjusting itself to its environment. The teacher should 
not only acquaint himself with the most useful classes or 
kinds of instinct, but he should know at least the im- 
portant habits that grow out of these in the child’s early 
years. Professor James, in the chapter on Instinct in his 
“Principles of Psychology,” ! gives a very concise treatment 
of the subject. He calls attention to the fact that there is 
always a physical stimulus and a motor response along 
paths of connection natively transmitted, with a certain 
tendency or impulse to make use of them. A squirrel of 
my acquaintance carefully secreted a nut under a corner 
of a rug at the house where he had called. Some associa- 
tions with nuts, based on prenatally established nervous 
connections fundamental to secreting the nut, led him to 
Perform the act. At his next visit some time later he 
looked for the nut, ¢.e. the sight of the place where he 
had seereted the nut called up the associated muscle move- 
ments necessary for finding it, and he seemed disappointed 
at its disappearance. In each case the situation was fol- 
lowed by the response usually appropriate according to 
4 tendency inevitable, unless supplanted’ by another or 
inhibited. 
Whether these native capacities reach their complete 
development before birth, or are gradually and automatically 
Completed by nature after birth, is not important. The 
teacher needs to concern himself most with those instinctive 
tendencies that are actually at his service. 
Instincts represent reactions which have proved them- 
tlves useful in the conquest of environment, and are so 
Well established that an appeal to them is much more certain

of response because of their impulsive character than an 
appeal to the more prosaic and recently formed habit 
paths. 
4. Instincts important in training children. — The 
larger the lists! of available instincts at the teacher's 
command, the greater are his chances of influencing the 
child. Lists should be worked out by the teacher indepen- 
dently, and no classification which is not carefully made 
by the teacher from his own point of view can be of very 
great value. : 
Those classes of instinctive activity which seem to be of 
chief importance to the teacher both in instruction and 
discipline are: imitation, play, construction, curiosity, 
or investigation, collecting, ownership, love, sympathy, 
sociability, expression, manipulation, ambition, emulation, 
rivalry, love of approbation, pride, independence, defiance, 
courage, esthetic and ethical appreciations (as in approval 
and disapproval), tendencies to avoid inactivity and pail 
(whether mental or physical), pugnacity and fear. 
The list hardly needs very much elaboration for the 
teacher or parent, since hundreds of illustrations must 
suggest themselves as instances of one or another. mile 
tion is a most powerful factor in life, witness fashion, prec 
dent, and authority, in the life of the adult. Every at 
striking enough to catch the eye is likely to be imitated, 
and every sound reaching the ear to be attempted. Mis

severally in the last half of his chapter. See pp. 403-441 of bis

as follows in this book must be forced and incomplete. On th? 
other hand, its great practical usefulness to the teacher, whethé

Haskell ! has described a list of a thousand or more concrete 
cases, . 
The natural energy of the child is released by play often 
with great satisfaction on the part of the player. It 
finds multitudinous forms, falling back on the other in- 
stincts for reénforcement. It needs no illustration? 
The constructive impulse is fundamental to the traits of 
originality shown by the child. Some opportunity for the 
exercise of construction in the outer concrete and coarser 
physical processes is the prerequisite of useful mental con- 
struction. This instinct deserves wider recognition and 
encouragement throughout the formative period, the kinder- 
earten and manual training schools being at present the 
chief agencies to use it intelligently. : , 
The child’s questions and his general curiosity lead him to 
accumulate knowledge and adapt himself in many ways that 
Would otherwise never be discovered. The very nuisance 
be makes of himself is evidence enough of the value of this 
unpulse, 
The collecting instinct leads him to gather together objects 
at all sorts, from postage stamps, cigar labels, cigarette 
Pictures, buttons, and so forth, to collections of minerals, 
Plants, birds, insects, and so on. It is fundamental to 
classification, and the orderly arrangement of knowledge,

unforeseen,

mental to both thrift and to thieving, to legitimate accumy 
lation of wealth and to swindling. It is manifestly worthy 
of wise direction, and dangerous if undirected. 
Love and sympathy on their instinctive side prompt to 
actions furthering the welfare of those toward whom they 
are directed. These actions imply neither deliberation nor 
purpose so much as a spontaneous unpremeditated im- 
pulse. A little girl’s whole-souled giving of her pocketbook 
and all her money to the desolate Armenians was a beautiful 
illustration of an instinctive reaction. Whenever simple 
childish expressions of love and sympathy are anything more 
than passive experiences in which self-enjoyment is the 
prominent feature, and whenever active expression reg! 
less of the self predominates in these manifestations, they 
should be classified as instincts rather than feelings. 
Sociability is variable, being strong in some children fom 
the first, but being counteracted by shyness in othe 
Tts value is linked with that of imitation and moral app 
ciation. 
The expressive instinct ig the root of all tendencies to att 
to move muscles, but it particularly applies to speech tel! 
encies, gesture, drawing, painting, making things, and the 
like. It may be counted upon for valuable assistance # 
habits of that sort. 
Manipulation, the instinct to handle objects apparent 
for the mere sake of handling them, is an extremely vit 
able early instinct, giving the child an abundance of 
formation for future use, especially in assisting the eye 0? 
the work of the hand, and so doing away with the trouble# 
later experiences of actually getting touch impressions. 
an object is wet or sticky, hot, cold, corrugated, smo! 
furry, rough, pointed, dull, and so on, it is almost always* 
sight impression which tells us conveniently how the objet 
would feel if we did touch it.
-P-A-G-E-93
THE BASIS OF HABIT-FORMATION 7 
Of the many forms of ambition, emulation, rivalry, and - 
love of approbation, little need be said. They are incentives: 
that have stood the test of years. They have been proved 
to have their uses and their abuses. Emulation has been 
given a bad name, but it is certainly capable of doing benefi- 
cent work. 
Pride and independence are related. ‘There are forms of 
pride which should be inhibited. Pride in really worthy 
traits of family, friends, or one’s self is a good and useful 
motive. Independence is the source of considerable power, 
and, where it is in danger of being lost, should be en- 
couraged, 
Defiance is the courage of despair, buoying the child up 
when he bids fair to be overwhelmed by difficulties. It 
leeds to be directed against difficulties, however, with 
deeds rather than words, and not against the persons qr in- 
fluences working for the child’s welfare. 
Courage is likewise an instinct useful in a variety of ways, 
but capable of distortion into bullying and foolhardiness if 
Tot directed toward worthy ends. _ Brute courage, the rush 
stand against danger, is not alone the function of this 
Ustinet. The rush or stand against temptations, wrong- 
doing, moral weakness, is no less a phase of this instinct. 
Aisthetic and ethical appreciations, while strongly tinged 
With feeling, have characteristic reactions in expressions by 
Word or deed. The act or utterance of commendation or 
tondemnation is in itself largely instinctive. Play should 
be given these feeling tones with reference not only to the 
child’s own acts, but also to those of others, whether found in 
those about him, in fiction, or in history. 
The importance on the one hand of freedom, and on the 
other of comfort for the development of mankind, or, in other 
Words, the importance of the tendencies to avoid inactivity 
ond pain are indicated by the child’s resistance to all at-
-P-A-G-E-94
78 HABIT-FORMATION 
tempts to limit the scope of his activity and by his shrinking 
from pain. 
Pugnacity, like courage, has its uses and its abuses 
Moreover, it too has a very definite application both to the 
problems of life involving brute force, and those situations 
demanding mental persistence and energy. 
Fear ' is a familiar and a much perverted instinct. We 
usually fear most the situation least dangerous, while those 
situations most to be feared are lightly regarded. This 
instinct needs direction on a more rational basis, and espe 
cially with emphasis on the fear of recognized wrongdoing 
fear of sinking to a lower level, fear of failure to attain the 
highest possible. Fear of physical pain must be regarded 
as inferior to these other forms of fear in its claims for recog: 
nition. . 
This extremely cursory treatment of the important u- 
stincts will serve to call attention to them, will sugeat 
examples, and at the same time will point out the directiot 
the development of instinct should take. 
5. The overlapping of instincts. — Besides these, all of 
the typical native forms of mental activity may be cok 
sidered instinctive in so far as they function automatically 
and without guidance. All of these instincts represett 
classes of instinctive* reaction, which may overlap; bit 
there is an advantage in having the multiple classification, 
since it is likely to suggest a possibility that might not othe 
wise be discovered. For example, play often covers imitt

tion, construction, sociability, emulation, expression, and 
pride. But one would be twice as likely to think of the 
constructive instinct, for example, if it were thought of 
both on its own account and in connection with the play 
instinct. , 
6, The classification of instincts. — In spite of the diffi- 
culty arising out of this overlapping, the concrete list of 
instincts should be organized in some classification. Pro- 
fessor Kirkpatrick * classifies instincts under six heads sug- 
gative both of their variety and importance: (a): the 
individualistic, or self-preservative (with emphasis on the - 
feeding instinct, fear, and pugnacity); (6) the parental 
instincts, including protective instincts and_ instinctive 
display of adornment and accomplishment; (c) the social - 
instinct, emphasizing the companion-seeking instingt, the 
‘ympathetic, love of approbation, and the, altruistic; @ the adaptive instincts, — namely, imitation, ‘Play, and 
curiosity; (€) the regulative instincts, covering moral and religious impulses; and (f) the resultant or miscellaneous 
stinets, prominent among which are the collecting, the 
“onstructive, the expressive, and the esthetic, with mention 
of the rhythmic and migratory instineta- ° Whether one uses this excellent basis of classification or 
another patterned more nearly after the old classifications of 
mes into egoistic, social, intellectual, esthetic, and 
oral, may not be of vital importance; but it is important 1 t the teacher have at his command as large and com- Blete a list ag possible of the most usable of these funda- 
mental impulses.

The usefulness of instincts must depend largely on their tence as well as their impulsive character. We

80 HABIT-FORMATION 
Instinctive tendencies may remain unchanged, may dix 
appear, or may be modified. It is necessary, therefore, to 
observe three principles in availing ourselves of them: (a) 
Make use of them before they disappear. Many a boy:has 
lost ambition, perhaps never to regain it, because condi- 
tions for years seemed to furnish absolutely no opening. 
By the time he has the opportunity to spread his wing, 
the ambition is practically dead. (6) Let those that ar 
harmful perish of disuse, permitting only those that are 
useful to remain unchanged. Ambitious children often 
work themselves up into a highly nervous condition, fearing 
that they may not be promoted with their classes. Remov 
ing the child from school temporarily throws this ambition 
into disuse. This neglect is best effected either by the t 
moval of the stimuli or associating disagreeable cons 
quences with the instinct. The substitution of another 
instinct assists constructively in the removal of undesirable 
instinctive reactions. 
Tt must be explained that instinct is never positively 
harmful under ordinary conditions; it is at worst relativey 
not so good as some other form of reaction. Men have 
killed themselves through inordinate ill-adjusted ambitiot. 
The instinct needed modification to meet the limitations 
physique, and perhaps of mental capacity. It should havé 
been adjusted to meet the conditions under which it 
worked. These were evidently abnormal in that excessi"? 
fatigue and possibly illness did not safeguard, as they usually 
do, an impaired physique. With less ambition or a o® 
reasonable pursuit of it, this instinct would have been bi 
beneficial. No dependence can be placed on instincts under 
abnormal conditions, such as peculiar circumstances 4 
ing the situation or perverted specializations of the instinch 
The third principle serves only to lead up to two othe® 
(©) Improve with any modifications possible those instines
-P-A-G-E-97
THE BASIS OF HABIT-FORMATION 81 
that do not of themselves make perfect adjustments. 
Since very few fulfill this requirement, by far the widest use 
of instinct is through modification. How modifications are 
made must next be considered. 
8. Two modes of modifying instinct. Instincts are 
therefore a sort of raw material utilized sometimes in nearly 
its original form, but usually, if not always, the original 
impulse has grafted upon it some new reaction or motor 
response, and so becomes habit. These modifications of 
instinct or of habit may be of two kinds: (1) They may” 
be secured by selecting certain satisfactory reactions for 
tepetition, as in the case of the baby’s movements* in 
teaching, creeping, standing, walking, gesticulation, first 
speech intonation, and so forth. (2) These modifice- 
tions may take the form of combinations? or complications 
of several movements, as illustrated by the ease with which 
complicated movements take care of themselves in writing 
or in framing sentences. However, each of the elements 
combined here was originally learned by selection long before 
the combination took place. 
9. Principles following from the dependence of instincts 
"stimuli. — Three possibilities follow from the dependence 
of instincts on their stimuli: (a) The stimuli may be fur- 
tished and the instinct preserved. A boy who is forced to 
Tingle with well-dressed boys, while his clothes are ex- 
ttemely shabby, is in danger of losing pride. The teacher 
May help him earn a good suit of clothes, or at least cultivate 
Pride in some possession that he has, such as good looks, 
Courage, or brains. (6) The stimuli may be removed, and 
the instinct thus perish of disuse. The hunting instinct 
Will be lost if it is never brought into service. The city

82 HABIT-FORMATION 
boy who never uses a gun will find it more trouble to cany 
than it is worth. The country boy would carry it all day 
for the mere chance of a shot. (c) The stimuli may be 
preserved, but the reaction modified or adapted so as to 
make a better adjustment (virtually grafting a habit on 
an instinct), or the stimuli may be somewhat modified so a8 
to induce a better adjustment. Fear, for example, needs 
adaptation. When it leads strong men to trample weak 
women in a panic, the reaction needs decided modification 
Instead of reaction in a wild stampede, the terrifying excite 
tion should lead to reaction in which the most prominent 
feature should be the consideration and assistance of the 
weak, 
’ From the impulsive character of instinct, it follows thit 
it can be supplanted only by forces of equal impelling powe 
The simplest way of inhibiting one instinct is therefore by 
substituting another. In one instance a child’s feat of 8 
muff was overcome by tossing it up and down, and the 
enlisting his play instinct. We have as yet no scale of the 
relative values of different instincts. . 
10. The child’s basis of habits. — As for the early habit! 
acquired by the child, only a few records throw any ligt 
at all on this problem, and the student is perforce obliged # 
find a child to observe in these particulars, getting ee 
suggestions, perhaps, from the studies of Preyer,! Perth 
Miss Shinn,’ and others. Probably the best way to sun? 
or classify observations and notes on the child’s formation 
different sorts of habits would be as habits of functiosilé

through (a) sense processes and processes of (b) imaging, 
(@ judgment, (d) reasoning, with (¢) the affections, and (f) 
the voluntary and the motor processes. This follows in 
some degree the ordinary psychological classifications.* 
The suggestion ? has been made that habits be classified 
according to various levels into (a) those whose strength 
depends on the recency of the performance of the act; () 
those arising from experiences of unusual intensity; © 
professional or technical habits; (d) those due to long-con- 
tinued operation of similar environmental influences; 
a (® hereditary habits (or instincts, as we should call 
em). ‘ : 
But this is open to the objection that the connections 
and implications of each class are not clear, and while the 
first, third, and fourth are unimportant as a basis for habit- 
getting in children, the fifth class is not made up, strictly 
Speaking, of habits. 
11. Summary.— Slight modifications or changes. in 
application of instincts often become permanent when 
found to be pleasant. Similarly habits may be modified 
and tendered more effective for given situations, since all 
actions are outgrowths of inherited or previously developed 
tendencies. The importance of knowing the basis is there- 
fore evident, 
Instincts are guiding impulses which are native and aid 
the organism in adjusting itself to its environment. They 
in with an excitation, and end in’a motor response. 
Since they represent reactions which have proved themselves 
weful in the conquest of environment, they have a demon- 
strated value.

84 HABIT-FORMATION 
In the training of young children the following instincts 
are most important: imitation, play, construction, curiosity 
or investigation, collecting, ownership, love, sympathy, 
sociability, expression, manipulation, ambition, emulation, 
rivalry, love of approbation, pride, independence, defiance, 
courage, zsthetic and ethical appreciations, tendencies to 
avoid inactivity and pain, whether mental or physical, 
pugnacity, and fear. In any enumeration, there will be 
overlapping, since all the terms are used of classes of re 
sponse. A double association for any instinct doubles the 
chances of using it and emphasizes its importance. 
It is important that the teacher acquaint himself with as 
many of these fundamental impulses in the concrete a8 
possible; but assistance will doubtless be rendered by some 
form of classification under which a large variety should be 
grouped. : 
Instincts may be transitory, or they may persist either 
unchanged or modified. Accordingly they must be used 
before they disappear; they must perish of disuse or by 
inhibition through substitution, if harmful; they must be 
modified, if ill-adjusted. Selection and combination are 
the two possible modes of modifying either instinct of 
habit. The stimuli of instincts may be (a) furnished, () 
removed, or (c) the consequent reaction may be modified. 
One instinct is best inhibited by another. - 
The classification of habits early acquired may be made , 
as habits of functioning through sense processes, processes of | 
imaging, judgment and reasoning, the affective, the volut | 
- tary, and the motor. |

CHAPTER VI 
Important Poases or EstaBLisHING Hasrrg 
“For use can almost change the stamp of nature 
And either curb the devil or throw him out 
With wondrous potency.” 
— SHAKESPEARE. 
Given the basis outlined in the last chapter, what are the 
main lines of procedure in establishing habits? * 
1, The teacher’s preliminary action. — Certain prelimi- 
naries must be taken into consideration. First, as in the 
old-fashioned recipe for rabbit stew, “catch your rabbit.”’ 
That is, decide upon what you wish to incorporate in the 
child's reaction. Secondly, determine what stimuli or sat- 
isfactions lead most readily and directly to the reaction 
desired ; and, thirdly, know definitely the nature of the re- 
action which is most characteristic of it. To illustrate 
the first, point, — if a teacher is to teach long division, it is 
evident that he must decide whether the quotient is to be 
put opposite the divisor, under it, or above the dividend. 
The second consideration should now interest the teacher. 
‘Here, as earlier in the book, it is difficult to express tersely the 
thought of helping some one else to developahabit. There is no 
freater evidence of our neglect of the subject than is found in this 
fact, Logically, we ought to be able to speak of teaching habits 
to children as we do of teaching them ideas. “Practically, the word 
has been seldom so used. We may impart ideas but not habits, 
instruct in knowledge but not in conduct, inculcate moral principles 
but not behavior. I notice, however, that Dr. Seeley speaks of 
Inculcating habits” in his “New School Management” (Hinds 
and Noble, 1903). I find myself gradually adopting the more or 
cumbrous word “engender.” 
85
-P-A-G-E-102
86 HABIT~FORMATION 
It will not take him long in this case to determine that a 
conerete eye-stimulus will lead most readily to correct 
position of the quantities, while the nature of the reaction 
(the third consideration) is equally clear. He can make 
the form concrete and exemplify the reaction by writing 
down one quantity, then a line, then the other quantity, 
then another line or not, according to the form of setting 
down the figures selected for the habit. 
If the teacher cannot or does not think out the relative 
value of these possibilities at the outset momentarily at 
least, he can be but a blind and vacillating leader of the 
blind. 
2. Automatic preparation. — This is not the same # 
saying that all are blind teachers, who do not consciously 
decide on the habit they wish to teach, determine the 
stimuli leading to it most readily, and know definitely the 
nature of the reaction. The same law that made it possible 
for the baby to select and make habitual the movements 
necessary for reaching a bright-colored ball males it 
possible for the teacher to select and make habitual prelim 
nary decisions and determinations relative to the situation 
confronting him with a demand for immediate action; std 
many teachers will confess to rapid guesses, — in one instance 
at some effective means of drill, in another at some stimulus 
necessarily producing a certain reaction, and, again, at the 
nature of the reaction itself. Automatic action of this 
sort is desirable in the teacher as saving wear and tear, ald | 
even adding to the efficiency of results. But it should be | 
watched to see that bad practice is not creeping into the 
automatisms through carelessness or unobserved variations 
Other teachers know that they do not make such analyse, 
either at leisure or spontaneously. To such, all habit-teac 
ing must be one tremendous confusion. Their only hoped 
progress consists in developing an ability of this sort.

IMPORTANT PHASES OF ESTABLISHING HABITS 87° 
3. The four phases of habit-getting. — All this is neces- 
sary to get what Professor Bagley calls focalization on the 
part of the child. How can a teacher explain to a child or | 
demonstrate to him a certain way of reacting unless be has 
picked out in advance the habit, its stimuli,.and characteris- ~ 
ticreaction? Even if he relies on imitation, he must act out 
all of these, or fail. ‘The first phase of habit-getting is to 
acquaint the child with the nature of the reaction as defi- 
hitely as possible, — to help him develop the ideq of the habit. 
‘This degree of preparation is incumbent upon the teacher 
before the real work of establishing habit is begun. It has 
been assumed that something has been selected for teaching 
which is worth while. This selection would necessarily be 
based on the instincts, capacities, and interest of the child. 
The discussion of this basis is not a part of the present plan, 
since here not the curriculum but the teaching process is the: 
object of our study. What then can be (een 
thild the more ready for the new reaction? /Firet, we may 
start in to work wp his initiative, his ardor,J We may make 
him as eager to acquiré the habit for himself as we are for | 
him. When we know what we wanthinr todo; 
ashe knows what he is expected to do and is eager to ge 
tt, we are ready for our gecond step of 
not any formal or time-serving soft of repetition, but an. 
eamest, whole-hearted seizure of every opportunity pre- 
senting itself, and an alertness to make opportunities when. 
they do not present themselves. It must be what Bagley 
calls a “repetition in attention,” not careless, shiftless, or 
formal, but active, living, painstaking practice. The 
only danger left, if the child is well started on a definite 
line of reaction in response to a definite situation, is that 
he may stop or lapse. A section of the methodology of 
habit (exclusive of the preliminaries) must therefore deal 
with modes of guarding against excepti lay eS, 1

modifications. To this end a renewal or rekindling of his 
initiative may contribute much, but other devices may be 
fully as important. These three phases, combined with the 
selection, and demonstration of reactions, constitute the four 
  doubtless recognize the likeness between the results of this 
analysis of the situation and Professor James’s formula (after 
Bain)! for the formation of habits. This similarity is, a3 
the writer has endeavored to show, inevitable.’ No ex- 
position of habit has forsaken or can forsake this point of 
view without losing in point, practicality, and closeness of 
relation to the fundamental nature of habit. Professor 
   Thorndike pas expressed the law on which habit depends 
as follows ¢ “The likelihood that any 1 
will occur In response to any situation is in proportion to 
the frequency, recency, intensity, and resulting satisfaction 
of its connection with that situation or some part of it 
and with the total frame of mind-in which the situation , 
is felt.”’? . 
lt wr readily , a3 is shown later, that each of 
these factors may be placed appropriately in the above 
classification. Frequency is naturally provided for in the 
methods of practice; recency serves as a factor bothia 
practice and in eliminating exceptions. Intensity may be 
like resulting satisfaction, a factor in getting initiative — 
When pleasant, it may contribute to practice, or it may | 
when it is unpleasant, contribute to the methods 
eliminating exceptions. The “frame of mind in which 
the situation is felt,” if favorable, is one filled with eage™

ness and initiative to embark upon the formation of the 
habit, and so bring about the necessary “situation.” 
Ifa frame of mind is unfavorable, it must be so because 
of its lack of initiative or disposition to work out the 
situation necessary for forming the habit. Professor 
Thorndike’s greatest contribution comes from om his insistence 
(@) on the importance of the resulting satisfaction, and (6). 
on the fact that every reaction, whether instinctive,or an 
adjustment through a modification of instinctive or habitual 
paths, must be an adaptation to a definite “situation.” . We 
say neither to ourselves nor our pupils: “Goto! We will 
Low proceed to form a habit of keeping our desks in order.” 
On the contrary, we become disgusted with ourselves or 
them. We convince ourselves of the advantages of this 
habit, while at the same time we set about making such 
teactions as will make those advantages clearer and more 
Prominent. If our memories and our resolutions are strong 
enough and our temptations are not too strong, we succeed in 
fying orderly habits, 
5. Other important formulations. — Professor Horne* 
gives five maxims for the “ forging or breaking” of habits: — 
“First, act on every opportunity. 
“Second, make a strong start. 
“Third, allow no exception. 
“Fourth, for the bad habit substitute something good. 
“And fifth, summoning all the man within, use effort 
of will.”} These again will be seen to fit into the scheme 
es, since the fifth is merely an elaboration of the 
Second and also of the first, while the fourth applies only. to 
breaking habits. 
Professor Bagley ? formulates his law of habit-building, 
‘Horne, “Psychological Principles of Education,” pp. 800, 301. 
New York, 1906. 
"Bagley, “(Class-room Management,” p. 16.. New York, 1907. ,
-P-A-G-E-106
90 HABIT-FORMATION 
perhaps too concisely, as follows: “Focalization of con 
sciousness upon the process to be automatized, plus atten- 
tive repetition of this process, permitting no exceptions 
until automatism results.’ Although the “initiative” 
(James), the “strong start” (Horne), is not included in 
this formulation, incentives are provided for in the discussion 
’ of the problem of attention. It is certain that they must be 
given a much more general application in educational 
processes. Bagley’s contribution is really his insistence 
upon getting before consciousness the thing to be done, 
not blindly telling a child to get a habit of doing some sort 
of thing quickly, but how it is to be done so as to secure the 
facility desired. Another strong point! is his advocaey of 
“altentive repetition” or “repetition in attention.” Mer 
repetition is far from a successful way of forming habits,— 
that is to say, the habits intended. It may form some not 
intended. Attention converts what may be only formal or 
perfunctory practice into actual practice. . 
Dumont divides the conditions essential to establishing 
habits into two classes— the conditions appertaining to the 
excitation (which he also calls the positive), and the condi- 
tions imposed by nutrition, which he considers negative. 
In connection with the conditions of excitation, he sf 
there must be sufficient force to reach the organ whose move 
ments are to be facilitated. The conditions must besides 
be able to apply power to overcome the resistance of othet 
organs to the increase in movement in this one 0rg®™ 
Lastly, they must supply intensity enough to enable thee 
other organs to change and establish themselves in # 
1 Compare also Andrews on habit, in American Journal of P av 
chology, 1903, Vol. XIV., p. 149. “The important conditions 
favoring the development of habit, are repetition, attention, "; 
tensity of the experience, and plasticity of the nervous syste 
See also pp. 167-174 in Chapter IX.

IMPORTANT PHASES OF ESTABLISHING HABITS 91 
quilibrium with modification (augmentation) of the organ 
exercised. If this last condition can be met completely, 
a habit may be secured at the first stroke’ But more 
often the excitation lacks sufficient force, and is obliged 
to make up for that which it lacks in intensity by frequency 
of repetition. By each repetition obstacles are removed, 
and the energy on each next occasion will penetrate and 
modify strata further and further removed. The prolonga- 
tion of an excitation has on account of the renewal of force 
from without an effect similar to its repetition, and for the 
same reason repetition is most effective when occurring at 
short intervals. If the intervals are great, opposing forces 
destroy its effects. 
Relative to the conditions of nutrition, Dumont empha- 
sizes the need of healthy and comfortable physical condi- 
tions. The flow of blood must permit adequate assimila- 
tion and “disassimilation.” It is useless to study when 
Jagged out. 
Attention as a factor is explained by reference to both 
Positive and negative conditions, An excitation, to pro- 
duce an enduring effect, must completely absorb the atten- 
tion so that contrary or distracting impressions may leave no 
trace, the flow of blood to the organs corresponding to those 
Impressions being obstructed.? : 
The earliest good formal statement for habit-formation 
Thave found is that of Curtmann:* “A child is accustomed 
‘This is Dumont’s position, — The present writer is not willing 
‘o admit that habits may be secured by a single reaction. No - 
Matter how certain it is that the reaction will be repeated, the 
ase, facility, automaticity, which help according to our definition 
fo distinguish habit, will not be found. .

Reme Philosophique, Vol. 1., pp. 341-343.

to an action by giving it the opportunity to practice 
this one especially, and by removing any opportuni 
ties for other actions colliding with it; thirdly, by 
heightening the pleasure in the action by a union of 
pleasant impressions with the deed, and, on the other 
hand, making the conflicting habits unpleasant by uniting 
them with pain.” 
Here again are found the main points of emphasis. Itis 
doubtful if either Bain or James had read this passage from 
Curtmann. But the coincidence in the main points & 
lected is evidence of their importance in methods of habit 
getting. : 
In one of the most recent German treatises on education 
theory, Dr. Barth? says: “Habit has at its disposal, # 
indicated above, only the mental mechanism, and can fune- 
tion therefore only with the aid of supervision, by working 
upon the feelings (rewards, punishments, and the directiond! 
the emotions), and through examples, according 8 
various sorts are developed.” Unfortunately, however, the 
chapters which follow, covering supervision, rewards, pU 
ment, cultivation or repression of emotions, and exam 
are too brief and lacking in connection to offer any syste

It may be interesting to compare Herbart’s statement, “that 
the function of training is to support, to determine, and to regi 
late; to keep the pupil on the whole in a tranquil and serene frame 
of mind; to arouse him occasionally by approval and reproof; 
remind at the proper moment and to correct faults.” The 
scription, which at some length follows this brief statement, & 
ables one to see that Herbart has made some provision for 
main divisions of habit-getting, except (very oddly) repetitio®.

is regarded from the traditional narrow point of view of 
German pedagogics, being considered under the head of the 
training of the will, and there only. , : 
6. The subdivisions of the method of. habit-getting. — 
Each one of the divisions of method here outlined involves 
% many devices and implications that it will be necessary 
in any adequate treatment to take them up in separate 
chapters. ‘These will therefore treath first, the principles 
involved in analyzing courses of study, lessons, and general 
situations to find the habits needed for the best adjustment 
to life and the method of demonstrating the habits dis- 
sorered/accondly, they will deal with methods of getting initiative; thirdly;‘with methods of securing practice;and, fourthly,'with méthods of preventing exceptions. 
ao Teése phases of method are not necessarily a succes- 
Son. — Right here a grave error must be guarded against. 
It must not be thought that these subdivisions.of method 
Represent a fixed succession of stagesin the development of 
habit. It may be appropriate to speak of successive stages 
of the process of imparting ideas, commonly called “the 
formal steps,” but in establishing habits the word “{ phase” 
‘ust be used instead of “ stage,” since there is no uniform 
Succession. It would very naturally follow that the teacher 
acquaints himself with his problem first of all, but it by no 
means follows that the securing initiative precedes guard- 
ing against exceptions. The demonstration or explanation 
of the nature of the habit may precede the getting initiative, 
but perhaps oftener follows it. Getting initiative seems 
‘pecially to pervade the whole habit-forming process. 
Itis prominent both in getting practice and in preventing 
€xceptions. : 
It must be remembered, too, that any of these phases of the 
teaching process may be rendered unnecessary by the fact
-P-A-G-E-110
94 HABIT-FORMATION 
that in many cases the necessary initiative, the repetition, or 
even the preventing of lapses comes to the child automati- 
cally. In this case it is manifestly bad form to waste time 
and energy laboriously trying to produce at best only the 
same result that could be obtained without effort. 
8. Summary.— As preliminaries to habit-getting, () 
decide what habit is to be formed, (6) determine the stimuli 
or situations evoking the reaction, (c) know definitely the 
essentials of the best reaction. A teacher may fulfill these 
requirements automatically without consciousness of the 
fact. If they are not fulfilled, whether consciously or not, 
only confusion results. 
When fulfilled, the teacher is in position to demonstrate the 
habit and teaching may begin, involving three additional 
factors — (a) working up a strong initiative, (6) securiag 
abundant and genuine practice (repetition in attention), 
(© preventing exceptions. The recommendations of James 
Thorndike, Horne, Bagley, Dumont, and Curtmann either 
concur with these or offer suggestions for the formation of 
habit which may be reconciled with the four main divisions 
of the methodology of habit stated above. Each of thee 
divisions involves so many devices that it is best treated a3 | 
chapter by itself, though the method of selection of the | 
habit by analysis either of subject-matter or of the situation 
is linked with that of demonstrating the habit. i 
These subdivisions of the general method of habit 
forming are not, however, successive. They may vay 
widely in their order. The demonstration usually preced® 
the others. The initiative may be worked up first of 4 
or at various points, fairly pervading the whole proves | 
Nor must it be forgotten that the automatic learning pre 
cesses may at any of these points relieve the teacher from 
effort worse than wasted and from danger of obstructit§ 
instead of instructing the child.

1. Scope of the chapter. — As has already been indicated 
in the preceding chapter, the scope of this one is to cover, 
@) how habits are to be discovered in subject-matter, 
) how they are to be studied, both as to their stimuli and 
their reactions, and (c) how they are to be demonstrated to 
the child. 
2. The selection of subject-matter assumed. — It is, not. 
intended to discuss these points by showing how habits 
ate related definitely to the aim of education or by indicating 
the specific importance of any habit in the organization of 
*xperience. This selection of subject-matter is assumed at 
thestart and, moreover, is usually specified by the authorities 
above the teacher as far as the course of study is concerned. 
Usually those same authorities have little to say about 
discipline and even moral training, leaving the teacher to 
‘afer what he pleases in that regard, within the broad limits 
of what is allowed.1 
It must inevitably happen that the teacher, when con- 
‘Some of the habits needing especial notice are later treated in Chapter XIT. 95
-P-A-G-E-112
96 HABIT-FORMATION 
fronted with actual teaching, will have a fairly definite 
notion of the general nature and scope of the subject-matter 
to be taught. In city schools the courses of study for the 
various subjects in the various grades indicate often too 
specifically the nature and scope of the subject-matter to be 
covered in a given term. In country schools, while a free 
rein is often given as far as prescribed courses of study are 
concerned, the traditions of the locality influence decidedly 
both teaching and school management. Thus a written or 
unwritten course of study is shaped, which may sturdily 
resist the new almost without regard to its practicality. 
“What was good enough for me is good enough for my 
child” is an implied premise in the reasoning of the mob, and 
it will be found from pulpit to pew, from capitalist to labor 
ing man, from college professor to washwoman. Only afew 
of the progressive see that, if the race is to advance, if out 
country is to keep its advantage, if labor and capital are to 
be better adjusted, our children must have advantages such | 
as their fathers did not possess. Accordingly, except 2 isolated instances, even a subject like nature study, which 
might contribute practically to the farmer’s culture of the 
soil and raising of livestock, finds no welcome. Even greatet 
resistance is met to the introduction of studies which would 
tend to equip the girl with the various forms of knowledg? | 
and skill essential to her happiness later as a wife and 
mother. Cultural studies, or such as contribute to fine 
forms of feeling or enjoyment, are generally reduced to the 
minimum.

packing. . 
Consequently in both city and country the courses d
-P-A-G-E-113
SELECTION AND DEMONSTRATION OF HABITS 97 
study are more or less fixed, and the teachers select from 
them certain material which is to be covered during the 
term and accordingly divided up into large sections or 
natural divisions. Then each of these is subdivided until 
certain units, usually thought of as lessons, are reached. 
These lessons are sometimes preparatory, sometimes review, 
now setting forth new truths, now drilling on old knowledge, 
tow inspirational, now mechanical, here organization, here 
application, : 
In many instances the relation between the subject- 
matter and the ultimate aims of education is carefully 
thought out, and the relation of possible subject-matter to 
those ends considered. When this preliminary work has 
been done, however, no matter what the aims that lead to 
the choice of subject-matter, it will always be found that 
tither some definite knowledge, the formation. of certain 
habits, or the cultivation of certain feelings is the immediate 
sim in the choice. Of these the last resolves itself into one 
or both of the others, since the cultivation of feeling is in no 
Way possible without securing appropriate ideas or appro- 
Prate motor states, and since the latter are the outcome 
either of ideas or of habits. 
It is assumed, then, that the teacher knows in the main 
what he wants to teach; that he has to teach a lesson of 
fone sort involving habit, i.e. a practical problem to be 
solved. This may include ideas also, but at any rate it 
hust involve at least one habit that the child is to form. 
This assumption may be more or less difficult for the 
Hetbartian who studies in detail the selection and arrange- 
_ Ment of subject-matter before he gets to the point of work- 
Ngout the detailed adjustment of subject-matter to the 
earning process. From his standpoint we are beginning 
ter the preliminary selection and arrangement of subject- 
‘atter havé been completed. It is an open question which
-P-A-G-E-114
98 HABIT-FORMATION 
is the more logical, — to assume that subject-matter may be 
selected without detailed acquaintance with the process of 
teaching it, or to assume that method possibilities may be 
exhaustively treated without a detailed consideration of the 
subject-matter. In contrast to the Herbartian point of 
view, the latter course has been taken in this book. 
3- Habit and incidental practice. —In many cases an- 
other difficulty will be met right here. The teacher may 
say it is evident that a certain habit must be secured if this 
lesson is to be really learned, but it is impossible to give the 
amount of practice necessary to secure its formation in the 
time allotted. If this is true, the habit will probably be 
fundamental enough to recur, or to be easily made to recur, 
in subsequent lessons. Certain it is that, if these lesson 
taken together are unitary in leading toward implanting the 
habits, such fundamental habits will be much more likely 
to be secured than if the teacher makes no special provisiot 
for them beyond a momentary exertion at first. 
The teacher either of the facts of the multiplication table, 
or of Latin inflections, or of chemical formule, who does not 
realize that these are to become habits, and does not teach 
them, whether separately or incidentally, in such a way 2810 
insure the incentive and practice necessary for'making them 
automatic, should thank his students for whatever valuable 
results he may attain. They are due rather to the good 
habits of study inculeated by former teachers than to aly 
merit of his teaching. 
4. The analysis of the lesson into ideas and habits.~— 
Having decided, then, that a particular lesson is to 
taught, our first principle of action, as already suggested ia 
Chapter IIL, is to analyze the lesson into its possibilities 
It must be made up of ideas to be taught, or habits, or both; 
and inasmuch as ideas and habits are not taught in the 
same way, but with very different_stress of emphasis, it #
-P-A-G-E-115
SELECTION AND DEMONSTRATION OF HABITS 99 
incumbent on the teacher first to analyze the lesson and 
discover which features are to become habitual and are 
therefore to be drilled upon, if the lesson is to be really 
taught.! : 
In this analysis of the lesson the important principles have 
already been Jaid down in Chapter IV., and need rather illus- 
tration than new formulation here. 
1. Look for the automatic element, te ‘bolnting fF in 
multiplication and division of decimils, is it the dofity 
to reason out what should be done or the habit of pointing 
off correctly that is important to the young child, suppositig | 
this reasoning and the correct habit could not both bese. cured? OT EESER Gy 2. Look for the serial. In the. series of operations ° 
Recessary for tying a cravat, each follows the preceding inn: 
‘ovariable succession. If no special order is important, but 
§ group of ideas or movements can furiction as well begin- lng at one point as at another, then no one habit is funda- 
Mental, though perhaps there are several involved. On the 
other hand, if a poem or statement is to be memorized 
exactly as it stands, the whole thing makes one habit com- 
Prising a more or less extended series. 
3, Search for elements entering into the lesson which 
are fixed and do not lend themselves to change. No habit- 
ual element, may be apparent in a lesson on the notable 
Wetory of Captain Perry on Lake Erie, but his memorable 
Message,’ if it is remembered at all, must be fixed as a habit 
Verbatim, and is no more to be distorted than is Cesar’s famous “veni, vidi, vict.” 
For an example of an analysis of a writing lesson from a 
dightly different point of view, see Judd, “‘ Genetic Psychology for 
fachers,” pp. 161-235. Also for reading process, pp. 236-264, Appleton, 1903. “We have met the enemy and they are ours.”
-P-A-G-E-116
100 HABIT-FORMATION 
4. Decide whether the details and the feeling elements 
involved in the lesson are to be kept prominent, or to be 
gradually relegated to the lower levels of consciousness. 
In learning to crochet or knit, one must be told first how 
to hold the needle and the yarn and then how to work the 
needle in and out in a constantly repeated series of move- 
ments. At first, interest may be definitely directed to each 
stitch, but finally both interest and the details of each 
stitch are entirely lost, either in the contemplation of the 
work as a whole or, more likely, in some entirely foreign 
train of thought. 
5. Determine whether it is desirable that the atten- 
tion be focused on the operation or whether other processes 
may occupy the mind and the process go on apparently a8 
well. The automatic character of whistling and of mechani- 
cal processes in mathematics is nowhere more evident than 
while the boy is working his algebra or arithmetic and 
whistling a tune most of the time, except when he is thinking 
out the problem or has found some hitch in the process. 
6. Discover if possible the amount of repetition implied. 
It would not take a teacher long to determine that a very 
perfect handwriting was the result of much practice. Each 
lesson must therefore assist in forming a habit. 
7. Note whether the point of view can be changed or not. 
We may ordinarily think of the battle of Bunker Hill 
entirely from the standpoint of the American troops 
There is nothing, however, to prevent our looking at it from 
the point of view of the British soldiery. As long as We 
are not bound to our past point of view and are open to neW 
ones, our mental ability with relation to the battle of Bunker 
Hill is not specific, but general and subject to various lined 
of approach. It is a very different case from the vey 
specific one, 16 minus 9 equals 7. 
8. Look for a basis of reflex or instinctive movement 
pan een pet ep
-P-A-G-E-117
SELECTION AND DEMONSTRATION OF HABITS 101 
If the child is learning to dance, his instinctive apprecia- 
tion of rhythm should be made use of and made to con- 
tribute the aid it is sure to render. : 
5. Complex combinations of habit. — But in the above 
illustrations, cases have been taken where it is perfectly 
clear that habits are to be formed. Often, even when the 
lesson is definite enough, it is quite difficult to determine 
just what habits are to be formed. In many cases ‘they 
defy the most careful analysis the psychologist can make, 
and in others they are so numerous and demanding that 
there seems to be no chance to get in half what is neces- 
sary. How these difficulties may be overcome may be 
shown better by taking a few concrete cases than by any 
attempt to prescribe in a general way for the varied sort 
of situations which may arise. .. 
6. The complexity and difficulty of analysis illustrated: 
(a) by a writing lesson. — In a writing lesson, for example, 
the pen is to be held in a more or less definitely stated 
Way, —the paper also, — the feet in a certain position, the 
body held erect, the paper to be kept clean, the copy to be followed at a certain general rate of speed, and atten- 
tion paid to various directions and suggestions of the 
teacher aside from the lesson of the day (which may be 
the way of making a “Z”). All of these are habits, some 
Practically secured already, some partially formed, others 
Pethaps not begun. 
The problem is not so hard as it seems, The children 
Ret practice every day in holding the pen and paper, in 
Placing the feet, holding the body erect, taking a certain 
tate of speed, and in profiting by the suggestions of the 
teacher, Most of these acts are sure to become auto- 
matic, and the problem is, on the average, to get the habit of making the “Z” and at the same time to keep the children from leaning over too much, For they may
-P-A-G-E-118
102 HABIT-FORMATION 
lapse from the habit of erect position either because of 
fatigue, or in their eagerness to get good results, A 
failure to keep up the practice in posture while attention 
has been centered on the letter “ Z,”’ or on some other minor 
point, has resulted in many a case of spinal curvature. 
7. (b) By drawing lessons.-— Jf a lesson is given in 
drawing a vase, the habits involved are not so clear at 
first sight as in the writing lesson just mentioned. It is 
evidently a lesson in habit-getting. The teacher wishes 
the children to get the ability to reproduce objects of 
that nature. What are the habits? The writer remem- 
bers well what an enigma to him as a child was the mean- 
ing of a noted illustrator who said, all that was neces- 
sary to draw well was to be able to see. The boy knew 
he could see as well as anybody, but he knew equally 
well that he could not draw. What was meant by see 
ingin thiscase? He had not yet observed enough to learn 
that often square surfaces are not seen as square, and, in 
fact, that forms are seldom seen exactly as they are. He 
had still to learn that colors are not always what one would 
think, and that black surfaces with a little light reflecting 
from them ordinarily must be drawn or represented by 
white, while white surfaces in the shadow must be pro 
portionately shaded. If, now, he could use these points 
to just the degree necessary in reproducing objects, he 
would not only have a general habit of observing accl- 
rately, but also one of executing or representing accurately, 
the object observed. Seeing in the sense used by the illus 
trator covered, then, all these sorts of activity, and more. 
When the teacher wishes the children to draw the vase, it 
may be because that lesson is set by the drawing inspec 
tor or supervisor. Little will be accomplished if each 
child merely makes a drawing, shows it, and hands it ia.

with his pencil. If the teacher has a chance to measure 
by noting the proportionate distances on his pencil, and 
thus shows the child how to measure for himself, — if from 
several whites, blacks, and grays he matches the light and 
shadow on the vase, then he will be on the way toward és- 
iablishing a habit which will help him to be independent of 
all guessing and to find out for himself whether the ver- 
tical lines are really the proper length compared with the - 
horizontal, or where and how much shading is needed. © 
Consequently this lesson, though not contributing much 
Practice, still in getting all the proportions and shades 
teeded will contribute its mite, if we treat it as.a habit 
fn. It may be a continuation of one begun moni 
efore. 
8. The teacher’s study of the habit. — Where it is hard 
to discover just what habit is wanted, or where this com- 
plexity and multiplicity of habit are found, what can be 
done? Aside from the principles already laid down for 
distinguishing between the idea and the habit, the teacher should think of the lesson as if he were the learner.* 
How much of this lesson requires thinking and how much 
Mere memoriter work or skill in making muscular move- 
ments? Or is there, perhaps, a combination of memory. 
and muscular habit? 
9. Considerations for study of the lesson in- complex 
cases, If there is no element distinctly of that memori- 
ter or automatic character, then no habit lesson need be 
given. If some motor or memory formula is found, is

-P-A-G-E-120
104 HABIT-FORMATION 
all the habit involved just one habit, or is it made up of 
smaller ones either separately or combined with others? 
If only one habit, evidently it is the one sought. 
If confusion still exists because of the complexity in- 
volved, the teacher must think over the whole course of 
the habit himself still more carefully to sce the relative 
importance and the nature of the combination of habit 
desired. But better yet, the teacher should perform the 
act, ifhecan. If he cannot, still better, the ability should 
be acquired. He will then know something about that 
operation at first hand. In one sense, at least, he has an 
advantage over him who long ago gained the skill and 
has forgotten how it was developed. 
If the studied analysis of the situation and the desired 
reaction is the first desideratum in complex lessons, surely 
the second and vitally important one is the personal exer- 
cise by the teacher of the ability he has to meet the 
situation with the suitable habitual reactions. No study 
is complete without that, if a habit is involved in what 
is to be taught. Whatever may be the explanation, any- 
body would be amused if a man hardly able to swim atall 
himself should attempt to teach a group of people to swim 
by reading copious extracts of the very excellent article 
on swimming in the Encyclopedia Britannica. 
But with these two ways of determining with all pos 
sible definiteness the nature of the habits involved in the 
lesson, a number of other considerations must be joined. 
In this study, observation, or experimentation, certai 
suggestions derived from the principles already laid dowa 
will be found helpful. 
In the first place, the teacher must observe himself t¢ 
see in just what particular he directs his reaction. For 
example, in getting a young child to go up and down 
stairs carefully, the turns in dark places where even the A
-P-A-G-E-121
SELECTION AND DEMONSTRATION OF HABITS 105 
adult must be careful are especially pointed out as dan- 
gerous. 
Secondly, the teacher notes what tends as separate 
sort of action to take care of itself, as the server of a 
tennis ball tosses it up with his left hand with no thought 
— of that part of the process. 
Thirdly, he tries to trace the effort of attention, ¢.¢. to 
discover where he is forced to attend. It is evident that 
the child whose desk is to be kept in good order needs to 
think of it not all the time, but while he is putting things 
_ inor taking things out of the desk. EL 
A ER 
« Fourthly, the attempt should be made to find out to 
just what he attended. In the above case attention 
must be directed to the books to see if they are evenly 
arranged in their places, and then to the papers and other 
materials, to make sure that they are likewise disposed 
each in its own place. 
Ritthly, tendencies to inaccuracy, and sizthly, tenden- 
ties to hesitancy may assist in indicating the nature of 
the habit. ‘The boy’s difficulties in dealing with long di- 
Vision where ciphers appear in the quotient may easily be 
avoided, if the teacher recognizes the littl i 
to be established for meeting such copfingencies. Simi- 
larly, his hesitation or slowness in peyforming an operation 
that should be habitual, as in the casb of long division just 
tited, indicates an inadequacy in thd gygomatisms at the 
Point of hesitation, and thus attention is called to the 
definite point of weakness. 
Seventhly, in some cases the subtractidn of elements 
that seem to be variable may aid in centering on others 
Which are fixed in a serial form, and hence habit. 
Ifa child is to be taught the action of a steam engine 
of the old type, first subtract all the ideay relative to its 
ippearance and application. Then ‘each Yoo movement 
\ \

of the piston back and forth as a result of the steam 
pressure brought to bear first on one side and then on 
the other. Next teach how the piston-rod motion is 
converted into the rotary motion in connection with the 
driving wheel. Thus are obtained the important elements 
necessary to a habit of thinking of the reciprocating steam 
engine, 
xo. Illustration of a study of a complex case of two- 
process problems in arithmetic. — Suppose, for example, 
the teacher has to teach arithmetic problem work involv- 
ing two elementary processes. The logic of the situation 
would involve a number of combinations. The two dif- 
ferent processes might be represented as follows: — 
first addition, then addition

The implication is not that the teacher must, therefore, | 
drill and make habitual sixteen sorts of habit. The point 
is rather that the teacher should know that these poss
-P-A-G-E-123
SELECTION AND DEMONSTRATION OF HABITS 107 
bilities exist; and it is perhaps well that the pupils know — 
them also, so that they can see what a poor chance they: 
have of guessing correctly. The solution of these prob-: 
lems will depend, as will appear presently, on the child’s 
powers of interpretation, on the effectiveness, of his asso- 
tistions, and upon his ability to verify and to criticise 
himself. . 
Many teachers have only a half dozen forms in which 
such examples are given, and even text-books are likely 
to emphasize a few to the almost total exclusion of others. 
Children get used to the wording of a problem. This 
expression means add, this multiply, and another divide. 
“How much did they all have together” means add; 
“if one has” means multiply; and “how much did each 
have” means divide. If the teacher mixed in all of the 
Sixteen combinations for two-process examples, such symi- 
bols would be of little service, and an understanding of 
_ the problem would have to be secured. Thus the pre- 
liminary abstract study of possibilities yields definite sug- 
; Sestions as to method. SES But our principle that the teacher should try the 
Process on himself is no less desirable. How is it to be 
done? Let the teacher find for himself an involved ex- 
. ‘mple of this sort dealing with unfamiliar computations. 
The following may perhaps serve for those not too expert 
“arithmetic: A double-tracked street-car line runs its 
‘ars af fifteen minutes’ headway. Suppose a-person takes 
‘aippled east-bound car that is going only two thirds as 
fast as ordinarily. How often will the west-bound cars 
Pass him ? 
Where does the teacher hesitate, and why? He may 
perience some difficulty in interpreting the term 
teen minutes’ headway,” though the expression has 
‘very definite meaning for the car-starter. So in many
-P-A-G-E-124
108 HABIT-FORMATION 
an arithmetical problem an expression perfectly clear to 
the teacher is quite obscure to the child. / 
It may be that the teacher will not readily see the rela- 
tion between the speeds of the west-bound and east-bound 
cars and the headway, and so will not be quite certain 
that he understands the real significance of the problem. 
Consequently the habit of interpreting problems carefully 
is one requisite. Having grasped the real meaning of 
the problem, he finds himself splitting up the problem as 
a whole into separate manipulations experimentally, at- 
tending especially to those which seem to promise a con- 
nection with other data. Certain words serve as keys 
to the solution, of which more is said below. Having 
arrived at the result, a habit of criticism will be found 
perfecting and verifying it. Indeed, this critical attitude 
may have applied itself to the result of the very frst 
process. Is the result reasonable? Does the answer 
seem too large or too small? Can it be verified by at 
other method? So in the above problem the answet 
nine, may be proved correct by showing that the sum of | 
the normal times for both cars must be five sixths of the | 
actual for both, because the loss of speed by the crippled 
one was one third for one or one sixth of the actual total 
for both. The actual time being nine minutes, the su? 
of the time of the east-bound car and the time of the 
west-bound car is eighteen minutes. Subtract the lot 
one sixth, é.e. three minutes, from the eighteen, and it 
should give the headway, asit does; namely, fifteen minute. 
11. Suggestions resulting from the study of the arith | 
metical illustration. From this actual study of what 
the child is to accomplish, the teacher will soon see that 
three habits are involved: (a) a habit of careful inter 
pretation of the problem, followed by (b) a habit of 
making and trying suggested combinations until one i#
-P-A-G-E-125
SELECTION AND DEMONSTRATION OF HABITS _ 109 
found that in the first place is possible in view of what is 
given, and secondly supplies data needed for use in con- 
nection with the remaining facts furnished by the problem, 
and, finally (c), a habit of criticising the process and its 
results. : 
These habits cannot be taught to advantage at once, 
Each in turn should receive the maximum of attention: 
It is best, then, to’ start on one separately and give a 
sumber of examples for practice in interpreting the mean~ 
ing. Examples that are clear and can be acted out or 
_ dramatically represented, are to be preferred to those that 
are more abstract. 
Next the habit of making tentative combinations ex- 
tausting the data at hand, may be practiced, and finally 
various habits of criticising and verifying may be estab- 
lished. Then in a fairly definite way these separate 
tubits are to be combined in problems which will serve 
‘o bring them together into an organization and from 
that finally into an habitual attitude of mind toward all 
Problem work of this sort. 
No application which does not cover all of these evi- 
dent varieties of two-process problems shown on page 
106 could be expected to be complete, though, given these three habits, we should expect a child to be able 
solve examples of any of the sixteen kinds, whether he had previously solved one of the kind or not. If he 
‘aunot, either he has not the fundamental habits needed 
%, more likely, his ability to interpret is too limited. 
1. Study of the stimuli of habits. — Another help to 
the teacher in studying habits is to study the stimuli 
Movocative of the habit reaction. The interpretive habit 
Kst referred to has as its basis written, printed, or heard 
‘mbols, We used to think that the eye glanced from 
T to letter, and then from word to word, but several
-P-A-G-E-126
110 HABIT-FORMATION 
investigators have now shown that the eye pauses a few 
times in each line at points determined rather by pre 
vious habit than by the size or position of word or letter! 
However, there is little that we can do to make the 
stimuli more favorable in the interpretation of problems 
except by insisting on time for careful scrutiny and re- 
reading, if the problems are read bythe child, and on 
close attention, if they are read to him. 
With regard to the habit of manipulating the data,» 
number of stimuli should be selected for notice. In the 
above problem the reduced speed of one car ought to 
suggest finding out, if possible, exactly what part of the 
intervening distance was covered by the ordinary cat. 
That result obtained ought to suggest the time it would 
take it to go the whole intervening distance, i.e. fifteen 
minutes. When the part traversed and the time for the 
whole is known, the result is easily reached, though other 
useless suggestions may have delayed the solution. 
In almost any problem in arithmetic there is some 
special form of expression, such as the use of “and,” 
“plus,” and “with” in addition examples, the words 
“Jess,” “away,” and other words denoting separation of 
some sort in subtraction, words like “times,” “if one,” 
etc., in multiplication, while in division it is “what was 
the cost of each” (or “of one”), “how many did each 
(or ‘one’) receive,” or the distribution idea in one form 
or another. A certain familiarity with the stimuli 288- 
ciated with the separate processes will give them greate? 
suggestiveness and help bring them to the focus. 
1 The investigation has been well summed up, and some im 
portant additional experiments described in an admirable pie? 
of work, “The Psychology of Reading,” by Huey. Macmillat, 
_ 1907. See also Walter F. Dearborn, “Psychology of Reading.”

course these words or phrases should not be followed out 
except as the suggestion is seen to have at least a possible 
significance. Any one who catches himself getting his - 
cue from some such word cannot but recognize its fune?: 
tion in calling to mind the appropriate activity and the’ 
importance of putting the child in possession of such 
cues as far as is possible. ~ 
To be sure, some teachers may not get any such analysis 
ts they watch themselves. The only response of which 
they are conscious may be a sort of automatic first mul- 
tiply, then divide. A little practice, however, will ‘give 
them the ability to read the main points of their mental 
process. And, while the analysis of the adult mind in 
its achievement offers no parallel to the child’s mind, in’ 
exposition of the goal of the child’s effort it is at least 
best the teacher can offer. Te 
13, The study of the essentials of the reaction. —~ Aside 
from the help gained by a study of the stimuli, the teacher 
vill be further helped, if he takes into consideration the 
Ssentials of the reaction in its simpler or first forms. 
The reaction in the case of the first habit in the two- 
Process problem is evidently careful absorption of all: the 
deta, giving attention to every thought or getting to 
Work on all probable lines beginning with that which 
Suggests itself as most probable. In the stage of verifica- 
tion the habit of thinking of the parallel implications and 
other ways of accomplishing the same or similar results, 
or of making rough approximations is the essential of the 
"actions. Comparison plays a large part in verification, 
itd the stimulation is in this case the realization that a 
"ult has been reached or a process completed. 
14. The study of habit as involved in spelling. — The 
hor results obtained in our schools in spelling are in the 
“ites estimation accounted for easily, if one considers”
-P-A-G-E-128
112 HABIT-FORMATION 
the Jack of real analysis of the problem by any except 
the very unusual teacher. Cornman’s' excellent study 
of spelling shows conclusively, that, as spelling was 
taught in the schools where he examined it (and those 
were good representative American schools), the results 
were no better than they were in the schools where spell- 
ing was not taught at all by devoting any special class 
time to the subject. Though his conclusion has to stand 
for the conditions investigated, would the same conclusion 
have followed, if spelling had been better taught, ie 
taught as a habit-getting process and not merely as 80 
many separate word combinations to be learned? Teach- 
ing that does not attempt to discover the habits at the 
bottom of successful reaction, whether in spelling, rea 
ing, composition, or grammar, cannot teach these subjects 
with real success. What success there is is limited to 
the brighter half of the class, which always persists in 
learning automatically in spite of the quality of the teach 
ing. The ability of one teacher as compared with ar 
other is therefore measured rather by what is done with 
the duller half of his class, and many fail in teaching sub 
jects of this sort, because they do not realize that habits 
are implied in the ends sought. 
Four habits? have usually been formed by the pupil 
before he spells accurately: (1) the habit of critically 
observing the spelling of new words as he comes upo? 
them in his reading, (2) the allied habit of noticing wher | 
words differ slightly from his image or his expectation of 
them, (3) the habit of hesitating to write a word whet 
ever its spelling may be in doubt; and (4) the habit of 
1Cornman, “Spelling in the Elementary School.” Ginn, 192 
? This point of view has been further elaborated by the write 
in the Report of the Connecticut Committee on English, Cor 
necticut School Document, No. 12, pp. 44 f. Hartford, 1904
-P-A-G-E-129
SELECTION AND DEMONSTRATION OF HABITS. 113 
taking a final glance at the word just written to see that 
it conforms to the intention of the writer and seems 
correct. bid 
Some teachers, too few in number, have been working 
for these four habits in their spelling lessons and have suc- 
ceeded in bringing the spelling of their pupils to a high — 
average because they have looked into their own mental 
processes and have discovered their working, where the 
emphasis of attention is laid, what the habits are in gen- 
eral, what stimuli call them forth, and what the nature of: 
the reaction may be. hit 
The spelling habits just referred to will also serve toillus- - 
trate the meaning and value of studying the stimuli and: . 
the reaction. Considering the first of these four essential 
habits, the unfamiliarity of a new word impresses differ- 
fat minds in different degrees, according:as they have 
developed greater or less sensitiveness. Whatever it is 
that suggests newness is the important factor of the 
timuli. The reaction is not merely looking at each let- 
tet, but comparing the appearance of the word with what 
Would naturally be expected with other words similarly 
Pronounced; and otherwise associating and attempting 
to fix the word. 
Ih the second case, the stimulus is a vague something 
expected in the appearance of a familiar word, just 
sufficient to call attention, if the mind has been sensitized 
tosuch impressions; and the reaction is the attention or 
°8e observation and comparison, as in the preceding case. 
In the third instance, as the child grows older the hesi- 
tation becomes less and less on words about the spelling 
ttwhich he is in doubt. If he gets in the habit of halt- ~ 
"g definitely when he has any, even the: slightest, 
ait eney to hesitate, he will secure for himself a chance 
her to act with the fullest information he has, or to
-P-A-G-E-130
114 HABIT-FORMATION | 
consult his teacher or dictionary and make certain. ‘The response to the stimulus is one of definite consultation 
either of his own resources, his teacher, or the dic | 
tionary. 
The fourth important habit, that of taking a final 
glance at the word just written, has for its stimulus evi 
dently the finished word or words in groups; and the re 
action is the careful though rapid scrutiny of them as he | 
would examine new words, and the comparison of their 
appearance with what is expected. 
15. Demonstration of the habit to the pupil. — These 
examples may suffice to direct the teacher in his prep 
tations (before the child is considered at all), and in bis 
preliminary analysis of the problem or lesson in hand ' 
with a view to discovering the habit or habits involved, 
  their stimuli, and the nature of the reaction. It is now 
desirable to consider the important means of bringing 
the habit as a habit to the notice of the pupil. It is 
obvious that before he can be expected to learn or a 
quire as an automatism the physical or mental reactiol 
desired, it is necessary to explain, illustrate, or demot 
strate to him what is wanted. Itis often, but not always 
an idea we wish him to get here. If an idea, it is usually 
one of the simpler sort, consisting of a comparatively 
small number of component elements. | 
The various ways of demonstrating habits are reducible 
to four. .. 
16. Four important principles for demonstrating habit: ; 
(a) by concrete presentation. — Among the elements ” 
posing a habit are usually a number that the child 
acquire by exercise of his muscles in general, and especialy 
those of his vocal cords in a definite order or successi0™ 
In either case the reaction must be made as conerete # ! 
possible. If it can be illustrated so that the child's |
-P-A-G-E-131
Oe SELECTION AND DEMONSTRATION OF HABITS 115 
ability to imitate can be given full opportunity, the chances 
of success will be good. ' 
The first principle involved ig: Make the habit con- 
erete by using actual demonstrations either given by the 
teacher (which is often to be preferred), or by some child 
who has the skill. The part that pictures, charts, models, 
and the like can play is only secondary. They may 
serve to keep before the child a basis of comparison, but: 
are otherwise decidedly inferior to the illustration by the 
teacher himself, if he has studied his problem. If ‘the 
habit is too subtle for effective demonstration in this 
Way merely, like whistling or making a clear tone in 
singing a high note, the description of the sensory phe- 
tomena which may be noticed when success has’ been 
attained, may aid. Too often reliance is ‘placed on de- 
scription, it being so much more convenient to talk than 
to act. This is, however, the poorest sort of demonstra- 
tion, as it is open to constant misinterpretation and mis- 
Understanding, even supposing the description to be per- 
fect; that is, free from error and omission. : 
17, (b) By using past experience. — Secondly, it is im- 
Portant to use the child’s past experience and his in- 
stinctive reactions in showing him just what is wanted. 
A general view of the instinctive equipment of the child 
is sketched in Chapter V. The basis of his past experi- 
ence otherwise depends so largely on environment as to 
make even a general sketch impracticable. Knowledge 
of it must be gained by a study of the child taught. In 
certain rural districts of New England a boy may pronounce 
father faéthih, and not be conscious of any error. At 
the same time he may be perfectly competent to pro- 
Younce correctly the sounds, fah and er, separately. In 
demonstrating to such a child the proper way of pro- 
®ouncing father, one should pronounce it a few timea
-P-A-G-E-132
116 HABIT-FORMATION 
distinctly. Ask him to pronounce fah, until that sound 
is fixed, and then the sound er, until that is certain, then 
fath, and finally fath-er. 
18. (c) By preliminary mastery of difficult points.— 
Aside from these two, another mode of making clear the 
nature of the reaction wanted, using the term “ reaction” 
for the whole course of the habit in response to any 
stimulation, mental or physiological, involves special 
practice on the points of difficulty, before the habit in us 
entirety is tried. The teacher knows in advance from his 
own study of the habit and his past experience, the nature 
of some of the mistakes likely to be made. This knowl 
edge must be taken advantage of in economical teaching. 
Thus a certain point of fingering recognized as trouble 
some, may be practiced upon separately in learning to 
play scales-on the piano or violin before the scale as § 
whole is tried. This preliminary practice on the point 
or points of greatest difficulty also serves to save for the 
crucial test, time, energy, and satisfaction, which would 
otherwise be used up or lost in drilling, when there was 
no need of it. How many children spend the time of 
their piano practice on the parts of their ‘pieces which 
they do not know how to play? 
19. (d) By leading the child to actual performance of 
the act. — But desirable as it is to remove all the im 
- portant known points of difficulty, provision must be 
made for deviations from the habit reactions which are 
not foreseen by the teacher. Consequently the last, ad 
perhaps most important, rule from the standpoint of evel 
preliminary demonstration is : Get the pupil to attempt 
the act. He may feel that it is perfectly easy and y¢ 
find a number of unexpected difficulties. If his teachet 
has a chance to correct his errors before they have becom 
fixed as habits, it may be possible to launch him at the
-P-A-G-E-133
SELECTION AND DEMONSTRATION OF HABITS 117 
outset on the habit you really wish him to form. ‘While 
the teacher can only foresee a moderate number of the 
possible difficulties the child may encounter, in his actual 
experimentation they are likely to appear in surprising 
variety. If the teacher can once secure a correct initial 
performance, he can stamp it with his approval and give 
it added intensity. If the initial action is not in accord 
with the desired habit, it must not only be corrected by 
further explanation, but there must be, so to speak, a 
second initial performance to make sure that the correct 
reaction has been secured, and also that it may be given 
approval. No idea can be completely mastered until it 
hes been either expressed or applied. : 
With these four points in mind, the demonstration of 
the habit should be reasonably effective, and the principles 
are equally applicable, if the habit be an idea-habit,' since 
acertain amount of presentation is ordinarily involved even 
in habit-getting, 
20. Summary. — Having decided on the lesson or 8e- 
hes of lessons to be taught, the teacher is aided in this 
thapter in determining what part involves habit-getting 
by the following suggestions drawn from the discussion of 
the principles and the nature of habit :— 
1. Look for the automatic. 
2. Look for the serial. 
3. Search for elements in the lesson which are fixed, 
and do not lend themselves to change. 
: The automatic learning processes of the child may enable him 
See just what is wanted of him without the application of all 
that ae principles. It may be that the first alone will be 
necessary. There is room for much good judgment on 
tower’ of the teacher as to which one shail be applied first, or 
many; but in general all should be applied unless the teacher certaii i i x then that the children have found out exactly what is required
-P-A-G-E-134
118 HABIT-FORMATION 
4. Decide whether the details and the feeling elements 
are to be kept prominent or to be gradually relegated to 
the lower levels of consciousness. 
5. Determine whether it is desirable that the atten- 
tion be focused on the operation or whether other processes 
may occupy the mind and the reaction go on apparently 
as well, 
6. Discover, if possible, the amount of repetition im- 
plied. 
7. Note whether the point of view may be changed or 
not. 
8. Look for a basis of reflex or instinctive movements. 
There are two courses that may be taken by the teacher 
to determine with all possible definiteness the nature of 
the habit or habits to be taught or furthered in the lesson. 
The first of these possibilities is that of thinking it over 
carefully, and the second (and more important) is the 
actual performance of the operation.

1. The meaning of initiative. — No one has ever seen 
a confident football eleven waiting for the time of the 
struggle to begin without being impressed not only with 
the energy pent up in the men, but the fertility of g 
source and mental alertness to take advantage, to the 
full, of any opening or situation which may offer itself. 
. This combination of alertness, of energy, of incentive 
back of the energy, and of the resourcefulness with which 
the energy may be used, may best be indicaggd by the 
word “initiative.” : 
It is said by the European military attachés at the 
battle of San Juan Hill, that the American troops showed 
remarkable initiative. They knew what they were after, 
and they scrambled up and on with commanders whet 
they had them, but with equal énthusiasm when they had 
lost them, taking advantage of all sorts of cover, and of 
any means of getting ahead that were offered. 
_ It is evident that if we can develop in the prpil what 
Professor Thorndike calls a favorable “mind-set,” and if 
we can get him all eagerness to acquire a habit or 
“possessed” to reach the peculiar degree of accuracy ot 
facility desired as he is sometimes to show off or makes 
racket, we shall have no fear of his failure. But witBout 
some vigorous and impelling impetus to activity, we shall 
never get the energy sufficient to prevail against the

tedium of practice which, as We shall see later, is a requi- 
site of all strenuous habit-getting. Habits do not drop 
from a clear sky. Nothing but a disposition to perform: 
the act automatically can be gained in a moment. ’ 
2, Sources of initiative. — How then can this initiative, 
this enthusiasm, this high-pressure impulse, be secured in 
specific instances? Although the expression “ getting ini-—

change,” which he makes the basis of “all that is most charactetis- 
ic of our mental initiative” (see p. 331). In my use of the term it has been extended to include both underlying restlessness 
and eagerness. Moreover, it is referred rather to the preliminary

which have been woven most deeply into our lives, must be 
the most ready, the most energetic and impelling, This 
truth has been summed up in the general biological law 
that development proceeds from the fundamental to the 
accessory. 
3. Self-activity as initiative. As soon as we attempt 
any differentiation of these fundamental processes, we are 
quickly confronted with their various phases and overlap- 
pings. There is, for example, an inherent tendency to keep 
going physically and mentally, an instinctive avoidance of 
inaction. This is what some people mean by self-activity, 
although as a rule it is made to cover the sum-total of the 
capacity of the mind for inaugurating and maintaining 
action, with the implied corollary that the child cannot 
grow except by his own activity. . 
But even in the various forms of self-activity, there Is 
great difference in the distribution of the various activities 
and degrees of creativity in different individuals, making § 
study. of the individual necessary. Tremendous as is the 
aid of a general responsiveness as a factor in the child's 
development, responsive activity cannot be counted upoD 
indiscriminately nor apart from creative activity, and there- 
fore the subdivisions of self-activity must be studied for their 
more concrete suggestions to the teacher. Those who rattle 
around in the world-measure of self-activity are in danget 
of losing all sense of proportion in the vastness of space 
Self-expression represents a smaller but still a very larg 
group of activities included under the larger head of 
activity. These capacities again are not only fundamental, 
but are also representative of whole classes of activities, such 
as self-expression by sound, self-expression by gesture, hy 
signs, facial expression, or by other movements, emphasiaiDg 
the responsive rather than the receptive phases of sel

4. Distinction between instinct and feeling and between 
instinct and motive. — Instincts, as we have seen in 
previous chapter, represent in each instance large classes of 
activity. It is often difficult to say positively whethér a 
given case should be called a phase of play, or of the imita+. 
tive, the emulative, or other instinct. To carry the analysis ~ 
will further, it is very difficult even, except in theory,'to" 
distinguish between certain feelings and instincts. Are 
sympathy, love of approbation, pride, and shame less feelings 
than most others of a long list? Here, again, overlapping 
in classification is noticed, and yet it will be found practical 
‘o distinguish the use of memories of emotional states and 
their connections in getting initiative both from the more 
definitely and externally reacting instincts on the one 
hand, and from the more crystallized phases represented by 
What we call motives on the other hand. 
5. Threefold basis of the development of initiative. — 
There are then aside from the general principle of self- 
‘etivity, which limits the teacher’s action to aiding in 
development, and indicates the impossibility. of molding, 
three main forms of fundamental functioning upon which 
development of initiative in any given instance is to be 
sed. There must be appeals (a) to the instinctive activi- 
fiea, (6) to the emotions,' and (c) to the specialized motives. 
  1In order to free myself from 2 possible misinterpretation; it 
thould be explained that appealing “to the emotions” here means 
‘rousing in the child pleasant and unpleasant memories, and in 
Sneral suggesting the agreeableness or disagreeableness of pro- 
Beeed lines of action. There is no implication of any special well
-P-A-G-E-140
124 HABIT-FORMATION 
The word “appeal,” as here used, means simply to set the 
organism acting, to rouse it now to instinctive activity, 
now to activity in which emotion is prominent, and now to 
activity in which thinking, whether calm judgment or 
careful reasoning, dominates the feeling factor in conscious- 
ness. Appeals are directed to the child, and it is only by an 
extension of meaning we may speak of appealing to the 
instincts, emotions, or other motives. Emotions are 
powerful in that pleasant experiences tend to be repeated a8 
a result of the agreeable associations linked with both the 
reactions and the situations or stimuli provoking them, 
while on account of their disagreeable associations unpleat 
ant experiences fail to be repeated. 
6, What is meant by appeals to reason. — Appeals to the 
child’s reason are often urged, and seem to indicate an addt- 
tional mode of appeal. ‘his, however, is not strictly what 
is meant, and the expression would be more accurate if i 
were changed to appeals through reason to the child's 
instincts, emotions (including his interests and variow 
appreciations), or to his motives. If an ignorant mother 
gives a child a slap when he is playing with fire, it is said ahe 
is appealing to fear, and that she ought to appeal to“ reason. 
of human energy from which action may be drawn. The feeling 
or emotional tone of an experience attracts attention to the details 
of the experience. These are therefore longer or more vivid 
remembered, and when recalled or called into play by association 
and suggestion, the appropriate motor responses follow more 
readily. It is easier to classify these experiences according to the 
feeling-tone involved than it is by the sort of action, since 
same sort of action, so far as can be discovered externally, maY 
be accompanied by radically different feeling-tone. The tem 
“emotion” has served in the past a generally beneficent purpose # 
a basis for classifying the kinds of experience tending to certa® 
forms of behavior and considered from the standpoint of thelr 
agreeableness or disagreeableness. This usage does not seem 10 
the author at all inconsistent with a modern psychology which 
recognizes “resulting satisfactions.”

By this is meant that she ought to explain to the child 
the reasonableness of refraining from playing with fire. On”: 
what does that reasonableness depend? Obviously on the 
fact that playing with fire is dangerous, and might cost him © 
bislife oratleast great pain. Itreally appeals, then, tosome. _

Theso-called appeal to reason will be found in all cases as 
in this to be really an appeal through reason to some phase 
of instinct, emotion, or involved motive. This, indeed; has 
always been the real meaning of the expression; but in the 
past it has been a blind appeal, as shown by the emptiness 
of the phrase. It should be an appeal in a logical way to” 
some definite spring of initiative. . “ Claceh 
1. The use of instinct. — Before a teacher can expect . 
fo make any wise appeal to the instincts, he must know 
Whst they are. A list of twenty-five has been given in ‘the 
fifth chapter.# The more concretely and in detail a list like 
this is held in mind, especially if it is the result of his own 
thought, the more resource the teacher will have. The old- 
time teacher knew but one instinct to appeal to, and that 
isthe last on the list, fear. A teacher should regard this list 
Ustinets as a whole keyboard on which he is to work out 
onious reactions on the part of the child. It is evi- 
t, however, that the teacher must know the keyboard. 
¢ may strike one note at a time, or more. The result will

"ore often deadens reaction than provokes it, and that the 
mt task is the positive getting of active habits, an 
“imiatin convenience of the reader, the list is repeated here: 
ig, omen construction, curiosity or investigation, collect- 
‘ship, love, sympathy, sociability, expression, manipula-

effort is much more likely to be made to spur the child’s am- 
bition or his desire to please his parents, to arouse his curi- 
osity, his imitative or esthetic impulses, and the like. 
8. Instinct as a factor in getting erect writing posture, — 
Take, for example, the habit of sitting erect while writing 
or figuring. The old style of training the pupil to sit erect 
was to hit the pupil, who bent over, a whack with a rulerora 
pointer, a distinct appeal to the fear instinct. Even thet 
failed to work, because the fear only acted as an incentive 
when the teacher was within hitting distance. When this 
sort of appeal to fear was abolished, many teachers invented 
other less vigorous and less direct appeals to the same in 
stinct, and with less effectiveness. Teachers who through 
inspiration or direction have discovered the instincts of the 
children know that they may use dozens of devices, as cea 
sion demands. They may have the children imitate good 
postures. The children can play that their backs af 
straight sticks. Their curiosity may be enlisted on how 
quickly they can fix things so that they are remembered | 
without help. The teacher may appeal to their instinct 
of ownership by giving them some pretty reward, or enlist | 
their love of their parents by showing how proud their pat 
ents would be, if they knew how straight the childrea 
ordinarily sat as they wrote. Ambition may be aroused by 
calling attention to the straight back of some great man ot 
military hero, whose picture illustrates this characteristi¢ 
Emulation and rivalry may be used by having one child | 
compete with another or one row of children with another 
The teacher may call up pride, independence, even courage 
and esthetic appreciation, by appropriate suggestion, 
while the one old-time expedient, fear of physical pain, may 
be abandoned. Instead, even pugnacity in the form of 
resistance to a dangerous tendency may serve, or feat 
a rational sort by showing how people afflicted with spin |

curvature are suspended by the head and waist in no pleas- 
ant posture to bring the spine into its natural position. . 
9. Instincts provide a wide range of appeal.—The * 
habit in carpentering of making a certain kind of joint with . 
facility may be secured through its application in the con- 
struction of a special table for the school, while skill ina 
certain stitch, or perhaps in making a flag for decorative 
purposes, calls for an appeal to the tendencies to artistic — 
expression, i.e. to esthetic appreciation and the expressive 
instinct. As a joint product, making of the flag appeals 
also to the social instinct as a plan calling for definite co- 
operation; and to the constructive and manipulative in- | atincts as something actually to be made. Progress.’ in 
endeavor of this sort may even be furthered by the response 
‘oan ethical feeling of obligation to make some return to the 
tehool for the various advantages afforded the pupil there. 
These examples will perhaps suffice in conjunction with 
the list of instincts to show the wide gamut of appeal 
Posible, and that often very many of these instincts may be 
| ‘pplied, though in many cases only a few forms of appeal

to. Different appeals to the same instinct vary in moving 
Power.— Nor must it be forgotten that each of these in- 
| Mincts as named stands for a large number of different 
Sctual reactions; that because one appeal does not stir a 
thild’s ambition, it must not be thought that no appeal 
wil. A boy, not attracted by an attempt to rouse his

128 HABIT-FORMATION 
The intensity of an experience! is a factor in arousing 
instincts as well asemotion. That is, if the habit is striking 
or spectacular, there is readiness to strain and endure in 
that direction. Fundamentally, the intensity of an er 
perience refers to the degree of feeling aroused, which must 
in turn be pleasant or unpleasant. An experience may be 
pleasant or unpleasant intrinsically or be made so by the 
associations in which it is set. All teachers recognize the 
value of interrupting themselves occasionally by saying 
“now this is important,” or “don’t forget that,” and 9 
forth. This seems to appeal to an importance-assigning in 
stinct, and the result is more initiative, because the impor 
tance of the habit to be formed is recognized. 
11. Emotional incentives. — Another phase of giving 4 
habit intensity consists in connecting it with the emotions 
The hard labor on a bit of manual practice, a boo! or a tabouret, may be done with eagerness, if done for the 
boy’s mother, or if he knows it will be purchased ab afi 
price, as it would if made by a bona fide cabinetmaker. 
This brings us to our second point. Appeals may be made 
to the boy on the side of his emotional nature, and throug?

child, inasmuch as he has had less time in which to devel? 
habitual pathways of reaction, which in the case of instint 
are native. If the habit we wish to form can be afili 
then with such a state of mind, it is altogether likely thet 
the definite path of reaction of the habit will serve a8

If a boy comes to school promptly every day because he 
realizes that through his neglect his room failed to be the — 
“banner room” the week before, it is a sort of altruistic: 
emotion that the teacher has attached to the commonplace 
of coming to school on time. It gives him eagerness, ‘per- 
haps enthusiasm. He finds means of getting: to school, 
bestits both himself and his parents betimes that there may 
be no danger of tardiness. 
12, The value of a classification of feeling.— Besides the 
‘cial or altruistic emotion which prompts man to do things 
{or others, there is in the usual classification of the paycholo- 
&st the intellectual emotion, the esthetic, the etbical 
(or moral) emotion and the egoistic. In each case the 
Bleasant forms of these emotions may be appealed to in 
Setting initiative, while the unpleasant are of assistance in 
thecking contrary or obstructing impulses. Here again as 
nthe case of instinct, it is better to keep in mind a conerete 
of the most useful forms of feeling. A classification 
Under a very few heads without subdivisions of the classes is 
Not $0 suggestive as a more elaborate scheme, The modern 
Psychologist, tends to ignore the old-fashioned classifica- 
ton, because of the practical impossibility of making dis- 
tinetions which will be generally accepted. The very

tates its importance, and, consequently, the most im- 
_ Wrlant have been indicated below in the various groups of

the traditional classification. If the reader prefers to 
classify any of these otherwise, its usefulness as a means of 
appeal to the child cannot be in any wise lessened by the 
change in classification. If, however, the classification 
suggests to the teacher possibilities that would otherwise 
tend to escape his mind, it will be worthy of his attention 
not as a finality, but as a scheme to be perfected and 
adapted to his own experience and terminology. . 
13. A classification of feeling. — There is a considerable 
difference in the impelling power of emotional forces in the 
same individual at various times or in different individuals 
atthe same time. Consequently an attempt has been made 
in the following lists to select those in the traditional. classes 
which seem more generally adapted to use as bases of 
initiative. 
1 One of the most complete and satisfactory classifications of 
feeling is that made by Professor Baldwin in his “ Handbook of 
Psychology; Feeling and Will,” p. 243 (Holt, 1891), which follows:

with marked development at one point, and with no 
manifest feeling at allin an apparently related particu- 
lar. Hence feeling must be studied and the classification 
must be used not as a basis of adjustment, but as a basis 
for study and experiment. When the study is completed, 
an actual basis of adjustment will exist. 
14. Feeling and interest.— Whenever an experience 
has enough of emotional quality to make it attractive 
and yet not to arouse very strong feeling, it is said to be 
interesting. Strong feeling is usually expressed by the 
verb, ‘‘ to feel,” or a synonym, and some vigorous word. 
“T felt exasperated,” “I enjoyed it immensely,” “I suf- 
fered dreadfully,” are samples. For such occasions the 
verb “interest” is too weak. The strongest adverb it will 
support gracefully is “intensely.” An experience may 
interest one “intensely,” or (as interest gives the em- 
phasis of the subject of the active verb to that which 
arouses interest, while feeling emphasizes the persol 
feeling), one may say, “this interested me,” or “I found 
it very interesting.” When Herbart considered the 
secondary aim of education the development of a many- 
sided interest, he did not expect that a person would 
have strong feeling in connection with a wide range of 
experience. As soon as an interest becomes strong, 
some other term is used: a man is “absorbed” in his 
business, “carried away” by the beauty of music, and 
so forth. On the other hand, when not much interest is 
expected, but a little is hoped for, we ,talk no longer of 
getting interest, but of some sort of appreciation. This is 
‘then a term popularly used for a phase of feeling lower 
in the scale than interest. It is, therefore, likely to be 
too weak to serve as a source of initiative. 
It seems almost a pity to pull down to the level of 
ordinary feeling such a word to conjure by as inieres!

has been made; and in placing it scientifically the writer: - 
is not overlooking the decided suggestiveness and ‘prac- 
ticality of looking at interest from the standpoint’ of 
what proves interesting. This detail has been neglected    
  _ by the psychologist because he wanted to find out what’ : 
feeling was like in its fundamental nature, and into what 
uubdivisions he could divide it. Not succeeding very ., 
well in either particular, his contribution has been small. 
On the other hand, the pedagogue has gained a some- ~ 
what new point of view, and has laid a tentative basis: 
for valuable knowledge in the connection of interest with.’ 
attention and with the guidance of the child. For;. in 
the first place, interest has been studied from the stand-: ” 
point of what proves interesting at one time or.anothen;” 
and, secondly, the various changes and modifications in 
j wterest have been noted both in their tendency to nar~ 
tw down and in their capacity for broadening out, and 
for giving to similar external experience a widely differ- 
tat significance. ee 
2: The verbal distinction. — The fact that the term 
interest” is used of the commoner phases of feeling has 
developed for it a double usage not found in the case of 
feling, and impossible to express without resort to 
phrases. “Interest in Wagner was intense,” may mean 
that interest other people had in his musi¢ was intense, 
or it may mean that Wagner’s own interest in his art 
Was intense. If the sentence read, “feeling in Wagner 
Was intense,” it could have only one meaning. So with 
the adjective and adverb. “He was interesting and 
Worked interestingly ” refers to the interest he excited, 
While “he was interested and worked interestedly ” refers 
40 the interest he himself has. The words “feeling” and 
_ “emotion” always refer to the activity-of the subject who 
feels, and hence one may say he worked feelingly in the . 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
134 HABIT-FORMATION 
sense that he had the feeling himself. There is no con- 
venient way of saying he worked in such a way as to 
arouse feeling in others. It is this double reference of 
interest and the emphasis on the thing felt which has 
led to so much misconception and aroused so much dis- 
cussion. It has made possible such expressions as per- 
manent interest. The ridiculousness of such an expres- 
sion as permanent feeling is apparent. Permanent in- 
terest is a useful-and pedagogically desirable expression 
meaning that a certain subject or activity is sure to 
arouse feeling in certain persons if their attention centers 
in that direction. It is strange that the numerous writers 
on interest ' have not elaborated these verbal distinctions. 
Once cleared up, interest would lose its mystery and gain 
in real and practical value. 
16. The objective reference of interest. — Interest 
should be defined, therefore, as that phase of feeling in 
which consciousness is directed predominantly to the

find the function of interest.

sciousness of the attractiveness of the experience is not 
lost thereby. It plays its part in the mental prgcess 
suggesting it, and with the resultant tendency both sto" :

Pleasurable emotions may be regarded as racial \in-. \ 
terests common in potentia to all, while in themselves 
interests are more personal and result from previous 
special functioning of the emotions. In this sense we are * 
using interest as a certain native or acquired capacity to 
get pleasure from a certain kind of situation, and to re- 
act accordingly. Any state of mind that is tinged with 
pleasurable emotions, unless they are too intense,.is 
tinged with interest, and even those states of mind char- 
acterized by unpleasant feeling aré interesting in so far : 
#3 man tends to seek satisfaction in ridding himself of 
annoyance. : 
_ The objective reference of interest is in no way better 
illustrated than when we speak of a man’s business in- 
terests, club interests, his church interests, or his interest 
in polities. In this case reference is made to the particu- 
lat sort of idea to which he will resort with interest upon 
Sceasions, These are examples of the permanent in- 
terests defined above. /

17. The three levels of interest and their twofold refer- 
ence, — There are three levels of interest. The first one 
‘hag itsoriginon-the plane of the new, the unexpected, 
the changing.’ A second level marks an interest in things 
as: definitely related by cause and effect, or by likeness 
and difference, genus and species, growth, function, 
quality, : quantity, location, time, space, identity, equal- 
ity, ownership, and so forth. A third level of interest, 
apparently. compounded from the other two, is an in- 
terest in matters of belief, relations which are hidden and 
not- understood, definitely suggested by the imagination, 
suspected ‘or :felt, but apparently incapable of proof. 
When these are applied to the two fairly distinct fields, 
natural:seience and the humanities, the following result 
is secured, which will serve to indicate not only the pos- 
sible’ Scope of the development of interest from the stand- 
point:of the object of emotions, but also to guide or form 
a-basis for determining and classifying the interests the 
child is found to have developed. 
I. Interest.on the level of instinct. 
\ Proféséor Thorndike classifies interests as instinctive and a+ 
quired, classing under the instinctive the interest in — 
(1) Moving objects rather than still objects. 
(2) Other human beings and living animals rather than plants 
or inanimate objects. 
(3) Clear rather than obscure or indefinite objects. 
. (4) Intense rather than weak stimuli. 
(5) Novel rather than familiar objects (unless the latter have 
special advantages). 
, (6) Pleasurable rather than painful stimuli. 
(7) Expected rather than unexpected stimuli. 
He calls attention to the diversity in acquired interests due to 
differences in instinct, capacity, and in experience, referring to the 
“ specialization of interest in a special circle of friends, special 
divisions of. knowledge, special profession or trade, a special 
locality," and: 80'with the many objects of modern civilized life.”

(a) In man. Paty 
In human beings individually. The child’s intent 
scrutiny and study of every newcomer —the butcher, the 
baker, the grocery boy, the new playmate, and the after. 
noon caller — contribute evidence enough of its existence. 
() In nature. 
In objects individually. Witness the child’s delight i in 
examining new plants, or animals or rocks big enough or 
startling enough to engage his attention. 
2. Interest on the level of definite relations (science). 
(a) In man. 
Far less commonly developed than the above, ‘and: 
contrasted with it by the search for cause and effect, 
likeness or difference, or other basis of classification, is 
the interest in the definite relations existing between 
men either considered separately or in groups. “Various 
Plays, like house, store, soldier, fireman, school, pieman, 
though imitative and often verging on the burlesque, 
still indicate the interest of the child in relations between 
Persons, The child’s interest in parades, in watching men 
Work, is also evidence of his first crude attempts to put 
these units of personality into relationship. His ques- 
tions as to why persons do this or that, and how, are in- 
dications of a similar working of his interest in the definite, 
telations of human beings. 
() In natural sciences. 
Again, as in man the child seeks to find definite rela- 
tions of cause and effect, classification, growth, function, 
- likeness, difference, quality, and so forth, so he delights 
to find them in objects and the phenomena of natural 
science, unless these relations are too evident. Childish 
discoveries, explanations of things, questions -such as, 
“What js it for?” all testify to this form of interest. It 
8 an interest greatly dependent for its breadth on the

sort of encouragement it has been vouchsafed in the 
child’s previous development. It is at the basis of all 
science, and has been called the scientific, speculative or 
philosophical interest. 
3. Interest on the level of hidden relations. (Art and 
belief.) 
(a) Among men. 
Interest in tactful adaptations, in ceremonies, in right 
and wrong action both xsthetically and morally, in super- 
stitions, and — by an extension — interest in the ulti- 
mates of philosophy, and in religion,’ is a field the culti- 
* Of course the interest in human relations as far as Tan is 
‘concerned may be easily extended from relations between mind 
and mind to relations between mind and Mind. 
This sixfold division is an adaptation of the one presented by 
' Herbart a hundred years ago. No other since has been so ill 
mninating as his, though the subject was so hastily treated and 
couched in such philosophical language as to fall short of the 
practical application which should result from such a classification 
The few attempts to translate his views have failed to clear UP 
and have at points served to dim even further, the already hay 
exposition of the original. . 
The studies of Preyer, Baldwin, and others have led me to gv@ 
the precedence in position to man rather than natural phenomen& 
The personifying tendency seems evidence of the more 
mental character of interest in personality. 
See the Lange-De Garmo translation of Herbart’s “Outlines of 
Educational Theory.” New York, 1901. See also Felkin, “Het 
bart’s Science of Education.” Boston, 1893. 
The importance of these forms of interest as indicating the 
scope of the child’s possibilities may be illustrated by comparing 
them with the five great inheritances or ends of education # 
indicated by President Butler in his “Meaning of Education.” 
“Tf education cannot be identified with mere instruction, # 
is it? What does the term mean? I answer it must mean 
gradual adjustment to the spiritual possessions of the ratte 
Those possessions may be variously classified, but they certainly 
are at least fivefold, The child is entitled to his scientific

vation of which, though never completed by child or. 
adult, is early begun. The questions of the child as to 
who made God, and the reasons for various natural, 
phenomena suggested by life, and death, the meaning of 
music, the nature of ghosts and other products of supér- 
stition, are representative of this field of interest. . ot 
() In nature. : 
The child early manifests an interest in the funda- 
mental nature and function of things, the metaphysical, 
ultimates. He recognizes certain harmonies and incon~ 
guities of color and form, of sound, of taste, of smell,. 
and even of sensations of touch as pleasant or unpleasant: 
Salt goes well with oysters or beefsteak, but sugar’makes: 
a. inharmonious combination. The relation, the under- 
lying reason why, is hidden. Many relations are be- 
lieved vaguely to exist long before they reach the level 
of proven knowledge. All forms of reasoning by analogy, 
and all forms of belief as applied to objects in nature, are 
seeompanied by this sort of interest. The attempt of 
the child and the philosopher to identify personality and 
Taality, is a phase of this interest, the one finding the 
Person in.the real, and the other the real in the person.

Just as a clear and comprehensive classification of the 
emotions will serve to hold together a list of more specific 
forms, so the classification above will serve to widen out 
the list of interests that may be made available. How- 
ever, it is useful only as it suggests some concrete in 
terests. Nor should these kinds of interest be regarded 
as working separately. They generally work in com- 
bination, and their consideration separately is only 
justified by the concrete suggestions thus derived. A 
teacher is dependent on his recollection of his own child- 
ish interests, or those he gets second-hand from others, 
or on observations made in course of his experience, fot 
the concrete list of interests or cases of interest he may 
associate with any of these six forms. These possibilities 
should be cultivated; for, the more concrete interesta 
they disclose, the greater the teacher’s chance of securing 
an active development of the child. 
19. “ Direct and indirect ” interests. — As has been seel, 
any of the six forms of interest may be latent and ur 
developed. Some forms of it are vigorous, others a” 
weak. Those that are vigorous are called direct inter 
ests. A boy may have a direct interest in building 4 
boat, but may dislike using a plane, and so have onlys 
borrowed or indirect interest so far as the plane # 
concerned. This may later, when he has become an & 
pert with that tool, become itself a direct interest; bub 
so long as he is interested in that tool simply becau® 
he must do with it a certain kind of work, he has merely 
an indirect or borrowed interest in it. The gradu 
widening out of interest is accomplished by the gradusl 
transformation of indirect interests into direct. 
In habit-forming the knowledge of the child’s partie 
lar interests is of even more practical importance thst 
in idea-getting, because it not only secures the des!

initiative, but it also promotes repetition, and may even 
protect against exceptions, since the child is not likely to 
react in a way that runs counter to his recognized in- 
terests. 
In appeals to the child's interest, above all use an 
effective interest. If that leaves a choice, use one on as 
high a plane as possible and one that is self-sustaining. . 
20. “Resulting satisfaction” as a source of initiative. 
—Another phase of emotion which is of fully as much 
importance as interest, to which it is akin and funda- ~ 
mental, is what Thorndike calls “ theresulting satisfaction.” 
One may not know of or think of any instinct, emo- 
tion, or interest which would serve as a source of initia 
tive. In such a case experimentation is in order with 
4 view to discovering whether the action to be made 
habitual is itself pleasant, or is allied to any form of action 
Which is performed with resulting satisfaction. Mark 
Twain's Tom Sawyer wished to do his work in clear- 
Ing the lot of loose stones with as little effort as pos 
ible on his part. His device of making it a play for the 
other boys was a successful experiment, carrying with it 
Sufficient resulting satisfaction to accomplish the task. 
Not infrequently the teacher is called upon to do such 
“sugar-coating”; and, where long and tedious drill is 
Tequired, it is highly legitimate. 
This experimentation is not only desirable where the 
teacher knows of no instinct, emotion, or interest’ or 
other motive which seems to bear on the-habit, but it is 
of almost equal importance in determining the efficiency 
f any of those motives. That is, it should be used as a 
‘est of the actual applicability of the source of initiative 
0 the case at hand. There may be unpleasant experi- 
thes, injuries, losses, or other painful memories so con- 
Rected with the proposed line of action that what would
-P-A-G-E-158
142 HABIT-FORMATION 
ordinarily supply incentive will fail in this application 
It would be all the more necessary to urge the especial 
value of this experimentation for initiative, were it not 
that the natural tendency, after finding apparent sources 
of initiative, is to put them to the test. The aim of this 
test, however, as of the experimentation previously al- 
luded to, is to discover whether or no and to what degree 
satisfaction follows or attends the action. 
21. The statement and illustration of the law of re 
sulting satisfaction. This law of habit formation is 
expressed by Thorndike as follows: “Any act which ina 
given situation produces satisfaction becomes associated 
with that situation, so that when the situation recurs, the 
act is more likely than before to recur. Conversely, aly 
act which in a given situation produces diseomfort be 
comes dissociated from that situation, so that when the 
situation recurs, the act is less likely than before to % 
cur.” Thus emphasis is given to the fact that wher 
ever the reaction to a given situation is accompanied by 
a resulting satisfaction, other things being equal, the 
same reaction is more or less likely to follow the give 
situation according as the resulting satisfaction gal 
by the response is greater or less. Nor must it be for 
gotten that associated dissatisfaction is an equally powe 
ful deterrent, though negative means should be use 
only in subordination to initiative along positive lines. 
If a child finds that his finger nails, which have beet 
neglected and then broken, may be trimmed up 
made comfortable by biting them, he will tend, becau® ; 
of that satisfaction, to remember in future instances the 
relief gained before, and after two or three repetitions he 
is well on his way to the formation of a habit; wheres#

it would have been escaped if the occasion had been re- 
moved by proper care of the nails originally, and if in- 
stead of satisfaction there had been associated with its 
- practice feelings of disgust at the dirtiness of the habit TL. 
a and a feeling of fear of its dangers. . 
Tf one looks over the list of his friends and acquaint- 
ances for those who seem to be particularly popular and 
generally liked, in nine cases out of ten, it will be found 
that the person selected is a liberal distributer of praise. 
That is, he (or she) has a, sort of habit of quietly or even 
openly approving the worthy words and deeds of those 
with whom he comes in contact. Consequently all those 
Persons get resulting satisfaction while in his company, 
because their reactions have all their merits emphasized. 
4s Tolstoi has aptly phrased it, “Flattery in all the best 
lations, however friendly and simple, flattery or praise 
'8 indispensable, just as grease is indispensable for mak- 
ing wheels move easily.” 
22. The application of the principle of resultant satis- 
ction. — This same sort of approval is just as much of 
4 power, and indeed far more so, in the life of the child 
than in that of the adult. The tasks that the children 
have spent hours upon with patient effort should not be 
pessed over lightly in silence or taken for granted. On 
the contrary, such exercises should carry with them all 
i tesulting satisfaction it is possible to associate with 
em. : 
If the work is in itself meritorious as a result of the 
fort, the satisfaction should grow out of both the re- 
tults and the effort. If the latter alone is really com- 
mendable, care should be taken not to neglect the only 
possibility that is left of securing resulting satisfaction 
*Tolstoi, “War and Peace,” trans. by Dole, Vol. I., p. 32. 
Crowell, 1889.
-P-A-G-E-160
144 HABIT-FORMATION 
for honest effort. If lack of endeavor has produced in- 
ferior fruit, resulting dissatisfaction should be connected 
with the neglect. 
In application to habit-getting, it is evident that satie 
faction or dissatisfaction can only be used after the habit 
has been tried. To be sure, the teacher can have the 
child try to picture the pleasant results of facility, but 
the anticipation will be very weak compared with the 
pleasure of seeing progress and feeling not only the pleax 
ure of achievement, but the pleasure derived from the 
desirable reaction itself, which is also combined in the 
resultant satisfaction. . 
One practical way of using this resulting satisfaction 
is to make use of the child’s instinctive pride in progres. 
Too often there is no attempt to show him the improve 
ment made. His writing is better. That can be shown. 
He can work faster and more accurately in arithmetic. 
Let him see his progress. His attention, his order, his 
ability to study, have all improved. He will get fat 
more satisfaction and inspiration from a teacher's frank 
and ready acknowledgment of that fact than from maly 
a warning and threat. Professor Swift! showed that the 
influence of watching their own advance from day to day 
was very helpful to his subjects. 
Three uses of resultant satisfaction seem to be most 
practical :— 
23. (a) Experimentation for initiative. —1. Wher 
other motives fail or are counteracted by unpleasant 
associations, experiment until some basis carrying Wl 
it a definite satisfaction has been secured. The follow 
ing will serve to illustrate: Suppose a boy is posses® 
of the absurd notion, which many boys have, that muse

isa study for girls; and suppose that he is behind his 
cass in the work, but has mistakenly assigned the cause 
to the music instead of to himself. His teacher wishes 
him to get the habit of recognizing and singing certain 
intervals when they are presented to him in his book or 
on the blackboard. He does not want to practice, and 
bis esthetic emotion is too weak to counteract his other 
feelings. What is to be done? Obviously resultant 
tatisfaction, supposing all other motives to be unavail- 
ing, is the only source. How is he to be aroused? The 
Wise teacher sings, or perhaps causes to be sung, to him & 
wide range of songs, — patriotic songs, battle songs, comic 
or ead ones, songs with all sorts of rhythms,— and asks 
hin which he likes best or which he would like to hear 
‘gan. If this elicits any enthusiastic preference, as it 
will if a sufficient range and sufficient tact have been 
‘Wel, the teacher follows up the advantage, but not too 
ltt, by getting him to learn the song preferred. Then, 
‘ue time later, after the boy has been committed to 
the pleasure of that song, the teacher may show him the 
Mlervals desired, what they add to thé song, and how 
he can find in other songs those samte intervals which 
uve him pleasure. He may try them in other songs, 
and hence the initiative furnished by the resultant satis- 
faction derived from one song may prove the basis for 
teiting the habit of recognizing and reproducing certain 
intervals, 
%. (b) Reénforcement of initiative.-— 2. Heighten the 
Weful incentive by such praise or other satisfactions as 
May be associated with it legitimately. 
The habit of correctly interpreting and reproducing 
light and shade in drawing may be forever barred to the 
thild by thoughtless and sarcastic treatment. On the 
| tther band, if the child has some, even a slight, interest
-P-A-G-E-162
146 HABIT-FORMATION 
in certain objects which lend themselves to practice in 
this sort of skill, that interest may be led to the drawing 
of those objects with the appropriate lights and shades. 
If the successes in the shading are applauded, and the 
reasons for the successes pointed out, while help is given 
at the points where the drawings failed and the reasons 
are pointed out for the corrections (always supposing it 
is tactfully done), the combination of interest with the 
resultant satisfaction will be sufficient to secure in some 
measure at least the difficult habit. 
25. (c) Testing and weighing initiative. — 3. Select 
from and test the instincts, emotions, or other motives 
suggesting themselves by studying the degree of satis 
faction resulting from the reaction. One may rely upot 
the collecting and ownership instincts for a habit of 
finding out the names for various common sorts of plants 
and minerals. But, if the knowledge is not fortheoming, 
~—if the child gets merely the names and nothing else,~ 
it is altogether conceivable that these instincts may not 
be equal to shouldering the task placed upon them. 
interesting facts be coupled with the instinctive activity, 
the resulting satisfaction will make them more effective. 
26. Motives as sources of initiative. — We have fo 
grounds for distinguishing between appeals to instinet 
and emotions with special reference to interest and the 
satisfaction resulting from certain actions, even though 
these sources of initiative could not in all cases be differ 
entiated. On similar grounds the motives of the child | 
are worthy of separate consideration. They offer a some . 
what different field of suggestion, furnish definite incet- 
tives, and are needed for the rounding out of the possible 
basis of initiative. 
Here again the psychologist contributes little to the 
pedagogue’s practice. Not even such a fundamental 
g
-P-A-G-E-163
THE METHOD OF EVOKING INITIATIVE 147 
question as whether motives are cognitive or emotional 
is settled even by those who endeavor to make that dis- 
tinction, and almost no attempts have been made to 
compile a list of motives found to appeal to children at 
various ages. As used specifically here, the term “ motive” 
telers to any definitely recognized ideational, emotional, or 
wlitional tendency which upon occasion will initiate 
activity. 
27. Motives as validated impulses.—-In so far as 
motives may represent a large genus of impulses, it in- 
cludes as species those instincts,! emotions, and interests 
Which are known really to have moving power. While 
instincts, emotions, interests, and, to some degree, ideas 
we like railroad ticket forms, all printed and ready for 
the agent to stamp, the motive is like the ticket which 
been stamped, i.e. validated, and is good until used, 
Unless recalled. That is, instinct, emotion, and even our 
interests, ideas, and ideals may impel us to do many 
foolish things, but until we have-stamped them as being 
good enough for us they do not pass into action except by 
Sort of accident in times of great excitement or reck- 
ness. A person may be hastening to catch a train 
and feel a certain impulse to run, but may not do s0, as 
apparently he has plenty of time. He turns a corner 
and gees by the clock on the railroad station that his 
Watch had stopped a few minutes before, and that it is 
‘early time for his train to start. He now has the im- 
Pulse as before, and with it a real motive for running. 
‘Although instinctive action is itself the logical outcome of 
‘ructure, it is ordinarily regarded as though it implied not only 
the possibility of interference, but a conscious consent, as indeed 
‘ually does in all important action. It is only in this sense 
that it is included in our definition as a definitely recognized 
Voitional tendency. In this sense, too, instinct becomes a motive 
‘cording to legal as well as popular usage.
-P-A-G-E-164
148 HABIT-FORMATION 
It has been validated by connection with the motive, 
which he might formulate by saying, “I would rather run 
a little than lose my train.’ That is, a standard and an 
action have been related. Many people lack that motive 
and would prefer to wait for the next train. 
Aside from the instinctive and emotional species of 
motive, and perhaps built up out of raw material of 
similar sort, there are motives of a distinctly cognitive 
or reflective origin. Below the plane of a child’s or an 
adult’s ideal at different stages are the planes of his 
principles; his definite purposes, his standards, his rules 
of conduct, what he really intends to live up to, the 
whole mass of intentions that have grown out of pre 
vious experiences with life’s many concrete situations. 
Let these precedents be once established and the action 
or inhibition, 7.e. the checking of action, will follow 
without wide variation. This sort of reénforcing of 
selected tendencies is more than a play of interest. 
of these impulses are active and tend to their realization, 
while the motive, given the initial stimulus and its t 
action tendency,' simply indorses them as up to or above 
the standard. Then the reaction takes place. It is like 
a precedent in law, an application to a specific case of 
the truth or principle inherent in a law or statute. i 
tends to action both because it removes objections 0 
obstructions, and because its own energy is fused wi 
that of the impulse indorsed. 
An accountant may have no desire to work overtime; 
but, when some one comes to him with a special diffieulty, 
stating that he will pay well any expert who will help

him out of the tangle, the accountant may consent. He 
thinks, “Tt will pay me,” i.e, “A motive has been given 
me; this corresponds to the kind of thing I allow myself 
todo.” 
He may then do the work partly from instinctive 
| motives like pride, curiosity, ambition, or kindliness, or 
* because of emotional motives, such as the pleasure he 
anticipates in solving the difficulty, helping a friend, or 
| paying a favor; or he may do it with direct interest in 
bis work as a motive, eagerness to get as well acquainted 
§8 possible with all its phases; finally, he may do it be- 
cause he “needs the money,” though in this last case the 
mal motives are hidden, being really those which deter- 
mine what he does with his money. The money-getting

It is evidently impossible in given instances to sepa- 
hte these various instincts, emotions, interests, and mo- 
tives, since motives include all the other really active 
forms of tendency, linking with them a peculiar indors- 
ig tendency. 
8. President Eliot’s emphasis of the permanent mo- 
We. — Permanent motives should be preferred to tem- 
_ Porary motives, and those most to be desired to those 
| les desirable. President Eliot, in his “ Essay on the Unity 
, @ Educational Reform,” uses the term in its widest 
‘nse, presenting at the same time a careful list of mo- 
tives important in discipline, urging the preference of the 
, Petmanent and more fundamental motives over the 
| femporary. He points out the fact that at eighteen 
‘ 
1 there are no methods of discipline analogous to such 
. ‘porary measures as “whipping, or the deprivation of

150 HABIT-FORMATION 
“By preference, permanent motives should be relied 
on from beginning to end of education, and this for the 
reason that the formation of habits is a great part of 
education, and in this formation of habits is inextricably 
involved the play of those recurrent emotions, sentiments, 
and passions which lead to habitual volitions. Among 
the permanent motives which act all through life are 
prudence, caution, emulation, love of approbation, and 
particularly the approbation of persons respected or be 
loved, — shame, pride, self-respect, pleasure, discovery, 
activity, or achievements, delight in beauty, strength, 
grace and grandeur, and the love of power, and of poe 
sessions giving power. Any of these motives may be 
overdeveloped, but in moderation they are all good, 
and they are available from infancy to old age. 
From the primary school through the university, the 
same motives should always be in play for the deter 
mination of the will and the regulation of conduch 
Naturally they will grow stronger and stronger 98 the 
‘whole nature of the child expands and his habits becom? 
more and more firmly fixed; and for this reasot these 
same enduring motives should be continuously

29. The development of motives. — Motives may already 
exist in instinetive tendency or, on the other hand, they 2 _ 
themselves be developed, existing only in a germ 
capacity. A child may have little interest in architectu 
but the manifestation of an architectural interest by the* | 
about him will sooner or later lead to the development 
certain habits of criticism and taste which may develop 
sufficient power eventually to materially improve the & 
ternal appearance of the town in which he lives.

THE METHOD OF EVOKING INITIATIVE 151 
In fact, precisely as interest may be derived or borrowed 
by association with ends or interests which are direct or 
immediate, so may motives be associated with much more 
vigorous forces and borrow more or less of impetus from 
them, 
It is often desirable when starting a new subject to aid 
the child in building up motives and ideals by leading him 
to make decisions as to the character of his work. Not all 
thildren are interested in manual training, physical culture, 
drawing, sewing, and the like per se, just as many. are not 
interested in history, geography, andarithmetic. If motives 
tan be developed in a specialized form applying to the new 
mies another point of advantage has been gained by the 
er. 
30. Appeals through reason. — Having set forth this 
possibility of developing initiative from a whole scale of 
lustinets, emotions (including the emphasis of the resulting 
satisfaction), interests, and other more specialized motives, 
‘Significance of “appeals to reason” referred to at the 
ing of this chapter is apparent. The result of such 
*ppeals would be first of all reasoning, but not necessarily 
the habits desired. Reasoning is always a means to an 
tnd, 4 process of adjustment to a definite situation. An 
appeal to reason.” is merely an attempt to prove to the 
tild by reasoning that the habit is one that is fundamental 
0 some desirable possession or activity, or has some vital 
connection with his motives. 
Saving up pennies for a bicycle may lead to a habit of 
Stonomy that thrift as a motive could never start, though 
“ving for a bicycle may not be so desirable in itself as 
More abstract thrift motive. Many a boy who is looking 
forward to being a business man, and a good one, utterly 
ails to make any connection between his arithmetic or his 
ography and this ambition, unlessa wise teacher has made ee ay 
ro
-P-A-G-E-168
152 HABIT-FORMATION 
a connection between the studies and business. Likewisehe 
fails to see the connection between good planning or syste- 
matic order and the work of the business man. 
31. The necessity of connecting initiative with the habit 
to be formed. — The point is then that the teacher may have 
decided upon the habit he wishes the child to form, and the 
child may have the motives, instincts, etc., as a basis for 
initiative, but there is great. danger of failure, unless the 
connection between these fundamental tendencies is made, 
not by telling him that it is important, but by furnishing 
him data and reasoning it out with him until he is really 
convinced. 
If you wish to develop in a child a habit of aversion for 
alcohol, don’t try to overrule or overawe him with meaning- 
less pictures of stomachs variously affected or of deranged 
livers, but présent to him as vividly as possible pictures of 
the torments of the unhappy homes, — the suffering of the 
wife and children, the privations endured, the dangers of 
: life and limb, the disgrace and loss of respect incurred, — 
true data, unfortunately too easy to accumulate, with which 
feeling may be aroused of an intensity that charts of diseased 
stomachs and livers could never produce. 
This development of connection between the motives 
and the desired habit is somewhat akin to the specialization 
of the motives before referred to; but whereas there the 
end in view was to show the possibility of finding a useful 
nucleus of motives relating to a specific form of action, 
here it is to form the special connection between an individ- 
ual habit and motives already discovered. 
32. Adolescent initiative.— The tremendous burst of 
adolescent enthusiasms which has been brought to general 
notice by President Hall’s study ? must not be overlooked 
1 See p. 148. 
? See Chapter XIII. on “Savage public initiations, classical 
ideals and customs, and church conformation” and Chapter XIV.
-P-A-G-E-169
THE METHOD OF EVOKING INITIATIVE 153 
by any searcher for initiative. The various sources and 
channels of spontaneous activity and adolescent ambition 
indicated by him are suggestive of no end of motives avail- 
able at this period, and also of many a reservoir which could 
doubtless be drawn upon to some extent even before the 
real awakening. 
This new-found self, instead of taking the child out of 
school, might with wise guidance lead him to make heroic 
sacrifices in preparation for the widest possible range of 
serviceableness both to his family and the community. 
The boy should be helped to understand himself, his 
possibilities, and the bearing of his ideals upon them. 
Many a boy becomes imbued at the high school age with 
a new zeal for his school work. He grows more helpful, 
sympathetic, and manly in his attitude. He devotes him- 
self wholeheartedly to some special subject, art, trade, or 
arduous task. He dreams great dreams and hopes great 
hopes, which are sources of inspiration to him, whatever 
their possibilities of realization. 
Perhaps the most marked, and certainly one of the most, 
universal, applications of this adolescent initiative has been 
made in the development of certain religious habits. 
Though this age was doubtless originally selected as a result 
of experience and not purposely, the curious thing is that 
religious teachers have been the only class to make use of 
this period of life. The teacher or parent should certainly 
with purpose and plan avail himself far more widely of 
these newly awakened emotions and motives. 
33- Judicious plying of initiative.— In the adaptation 
to the sources of initiative, care must be taken on the one 
hand not to overwork the initiative once secured, and so 
on “The adolescent psychology of conversion” in Hall’s “ Ado- 
lescence.” New York, 1904. Aiso his briefer edition of the 
same, entitled “Youth.’”” New York, 1907.
-P-A-G-E-170
154 HABIT-FORMATION 
interfere with the action. You may have trouble in getting 
up your initiative or, to use a current metaphor, “in crank- 
ing your engine,”’ but once effectively started, you cannot 
dodge too quickly. All you have to do is to get out of the 
way, get others out of the way, and the energy there will 
do the rest. This is equally true of many forms of initiative. 
After presenting his children with new skates, a father 
does not need to spend a half hour telling them how 
pleased he would be if they would learn to skate. 
On the other hand, there are incentives worthy of the 
name, but they lack power. The habit in question may be 
a difficult and tedious one to form. You may need four 
cylinders when you have only two (to lapse again into 
automobile metaphor). That is, the power must be used 
much more economically and exhaustively than before. It 
must be applied for a longer time to get any apparent 
results. A boy may need several half hours of persuasion 
before he forms the habit of practicing intelligently for half 
an hour a day on a new violin furnished him. 
Of obvious importance is the principle, — Use any fount 
of initiative singly or any combinations of all the possible 
sources that will prove best and most effective. It so 
often happens that a child is hovering on the very brink of 
a most determined resolve when just one more well-directed 
appeal would secure the initiative desired, but the teacher 
has already made appeals and has trusted to luck for the 
result. Let him rather trust to the results for his luck, and 
make sure of the initiative. 
The good sermon, the good plea of any sort leading to 
the formation of habit, evidences the varied and multiple 
appeal to incentives. 
In all this chapter the teacher has been thought of as 4 
prominent feature of the environment quick to seize upon 
and to make suggestions that would enlist initiative. The

THE METHOD OF EVOKING INITIATIVE 155 
| withdrawal of the teacher’s support, unless an adequate 
source of initiative has been found, is to weaken greatly 
. almost any form of initiative. . 
34. Positive incentives should be preferred to negative. — 
Nor should it be forgotten, particularly in the case of the 
emotions, that use may be made of those motives which, like 
disgust, avoidance of pain, and dislike of the ugly, are 
negative and inhibitory in character. But these are last 
resorts, and should never take the place of a possible positive _ 
impulse. A child may conduct himself in an orderly fashion 
in the school halls, because there are teachers in each hall 
and discovery with its attendant trouble is certain. The 
motiveisnegative. On the other hand, he may conduct him- 
self with equal propriety because he has been put on his 
honor, has a desire to promote the general school spirit, or is 
anxious to prove his qualifications for an official position in 
a formal school organization, such as the school city or the 
school state. The positive impulse will develop his char- 
acter, while the negative stunts his moral growth. 
35. Summary. — Initiative is the term applied to any 
combination of impulses resulting in energy and resource. 
Self-activity and self-expression are broad terms covering 
countless sources of initiative. , 
The more concretely and variously these sources are 
borne in mind, the greater will be the resource of the teacher 
in enlisting the child’s initiative. Instincts, emotions 
(including interests and satisfactions), and other motives 
serve asa basis for classifying the sources of initiative, 
which are best studied in the individual instances in which 
they manifest themselves. “Appeals to reason” are really 
appeals through reason. : 
The child’s numerous instincts should be regarded as a 
keyboard to be played upon for new adjustment and for 
initiative. Instincts provide a wide range of application,
-P-A-G-E-172
156 HABIT-FORMATION 
even the same instinct furnishing more or less initiative 
according as the mode or the time of appeal to it is fortunate, 
or less so. That which is striking or spectacular, and so 
excites the attention, is especially effective. 
The emotions furnish a basis of initiative much like instinct, 
but devoid usually of any particular previously determined 
form of reaction. This makes the habit desired a possibility 
as an outlet for feeling. A classification which will aid in 
suggesting what various forms of feeling may be roused is 
desirable. Whether it be made along traditional lines, 
the egoistic, social, intellectual, esthetic, and moral, or 
upon some other basis, depends on which proves the most 
practical and most fertile in suggestion. 
Interest is emotional in character and differs from 
feeling only in that it ordinarily is applied to the less violent 
phases of feeling and with strong reference to the object of 
the feeling. The variety in the usage of the word “ inter- 
est’ and its derivatives plainly indicates its double ref- 
erence, 
Pedagogically, important gains have been made by the 
study not only of the feeling, but of that by which it is 
aroused. Permanent interests illustrate this objective 
reference. 
The interests of children vary so widely among different 
individuals that it is perhaps best to use as a basis of classifi- 
cation for those interests which the teacher discovers the 
following adaptation of one made by Herbart.: — 
1. Interest in individual persons. 
2. Interest in individual objects. 
3. Interest in the definite grouping, relations, and affilia- 
tions of men. 
4, Interest in the definite relations of natural phenomena, 
likeness, difference, cause, effect, and the like. . 
5. Interest in relations of humanity, which are more or
-P-A-G-E-173
THE METHOD OF EVOKING INITIATIVE 157 
less vaguely comprehended, matters of fact and belief, 
relations to right and wrong and to the Infinite. 
6. Interest in the relations of objects, which are more or 
less vaguely comprehended, matters of taste and harmony, 
and function. 
The teacher’s own experience and observation, written 
records and oral records of others’ experiences, should be 
studied for a definite list of such interests. 
The interests of the child are in a constant state of change, 
largely one of growth by the addition of new direct interests 
developed out of indirect interests. The knowledge of the 
child’s interests and the use of interests which are effec- 
tive, but on as high a plane as possible, are important items 
in skillful teaching. 
A very important source of initiative is found in any 
reaction which produces satisfaction or has satisfaction 
closely associated with it. This is dependent on the 
general principle that, other things being equal, resultant 
associated satisfaction is a vigorous incentive to the repeti- 
tion of an act, while resultant associated dissatisfaction is a 
strong deterrent. This principle may be advantageously 
applied in three ways: (a) where other motives fail, ex- 
periment until an action has been discovered which is 
characterized by definite satisfaction and may serve as a 
basis for the habit. (6) Heighten the useful incentive by 
such praise or other satisfactions as may be associated 
with it legitimately. (c) Select from and test the instincts, 
emotions, interests, or other motives suggesting themselves 
by studying the degree of satisfaction resulting from the 
reaction. 
Motives are definitely recognized ideational, emotional, 
or volitional tendencies which upon occasion will initiate 
action. As a class, motives include not only “validated” 
instincts, emotions, and interests, but also such ideas,
-P-A-G-E-174
158 HABIT-FORMATION 
ideals, principles, definite purposes, standards, and crystal- 
lized intentions as have impelling force. 
Use may also be made of any of these specialized ten- 
dencies, and they should be developed so as both to widen 
their applicability and to fit an originally simple tendency 
for its adjustment to more complex situations. Permanent 
and desirable motives are to be relied upon rather than 
the temporary and less desirable. 
Again, it is often necessary to connect a desired reaction 
with a motive by definite reasoning. The association will 
not be made automatically in many cases when it seems to 
be very evident to the adult mind. Appeals to reason 
often refer to the need of connecting with some motive 
the habit to be formed. 
The awakening of motives at adolescence must not be 
overlooked. Their power is evidenced by their general 
application in forming religious habits. 
Good judgment must be used in appealing to sources of 
initiative, and care must be taken neither to overdo the 
appeal and interrupt the reaction nor to enlist incentives 
inadequately. Combinations of incentives must be used, 
where they are not strong enough separately. Positive 
are always to be preferred to negative incentives.

“ Practice makes perfect.” 
“Usus promptum fecit.”” 
“Little strokes fell great oaks.” 
1. Repetition the desideratum of practice. — Having ini- 
tiative, the sooner practice is begun, the better. Repeti- 
tion, but not humdrum repetition, is the desideratum of 
practice. Still, whenever habits are to be formed, a cer- 
tain amount of repetition, monotony, and effort are un- 
avoidable, and we never need worry about making our drill 
work in school so interesting that there is no opportunity 
for accustoming the child to work when discomfort or even. 
hardship is involved. Method teaching has heretofore 
dealt almost exclusively with ideas. We have come to 
think of repetition, like reviews, as something to be induced 
from different points of view. Thus considerable variety 
and much interest are possible for imparting ideas, but 
there is a distinct loss of efficiency in establishing habits. 
Dr. Hisenlohr,' for example, in speaking of the more 
general skill rather than the more specific habit, is enunciat- 
ing a very dangerous principle, if he means anything more 
than that habits should be variously applied, when he says: 
“The more manifold and varied these repetitions are, 
instead of continually going over the same beaten track, the 
more unrestricted and unconstrained will be the acquired 
skill; for which reason we cannot enough recommend 
repetition of what has gone before, from a different stand-

point of view, and under other conditions, especially in all 
mental studies.”’ 
In habit-getting no such repetition is adequate. The 
same habit path must be traveled in ‘the same old way” 
without modification, until the plastic nerve tissue sets. 
We may lead up to it and away from it in interesting ways, 
but then the time of practice is shortened. If, however, 
the practice is made more effective as a result of the interest 
and the attention which goes with it, as often happens, then. 
surely something should be done toward making the 
beginning of our practice more interesting and its results 
more vital to the child. 
It may be a question whether Andrews‘ is right in say- 
ing: “A mental experience of great intensity or interest 
results without repetition in a strong habitual tendency.” 
. “A great flood in a single day tears out a path 
which a smaller stream would require years to form.” But 
the analogy breaks down, because, although the result may 
appear the same, there is, until an experience has. been 
established through repetition, a lack of the facility in- 
volved in habit. Consequently it seems much more likely 
that the larger number of associations, resulting from the 
intensity of the experience, leads to frequent repetition, 
and thus sooner or later to habit. Moreover, the act of atten- 
tion is always enlivened by this intensity, and thus the 
repetition with attention which is the only really valuable 
sort, as will be seen later, is more likely to follow. 
2. The amount of repetition. —~It is hard to say just 
when reaction becomes second nature to us, t.e. automatic 
or habitual. Bagley suggests that habit-forming is like 
erystallization. A little more and a little more is added to 
a solution; but, if one stops short of enough to produce 
* Andrews, B. R. On Habit, American| Journal br Psychology, Vol. EIV., p. 146.

Ce ee hp me A RT METHODS OF SECURING PRACTICE 161 
crystallization, all of the previous work has apparently gone 
for naught. Experience alone will tell how much practice 
is needed, and then only for average students in average 
situations. 
All experiments and practical experience as well go to 
show that time is necessary for reaching the limit of facility 
and power possible of attainment. We must not expect it 
too soon of the child, even in simple reaction. 
3. Thoughtful and earnest practice essential. — Moreover, 
the practice must be thoughtfully and earnestly under- 
taken. Bagley has this same point in mind when he speaks 
of “attentive repetition.” 1 The great bane of practice has 
been, that it was and is so easy for the child to go through 
the form without the substance. The classic instance of the 
boy who had to write “have gone” two hundred times 
after school hours and, having finished, left a note for his 
teacher saying, “I have went home,” is a case in point. 
It is not claimed that there is no value in partially in- 
attentive repetition. It is possible to commit words to 
memory by saying them over and over carelessly, but only 
at the expense of much unnecessary time; consequently, 
after various ways of securing adequate amount of practice 
have been considered, some devices for making practice not 
merely formal, but actual, will be taken up. 
4. The relation between repetition and initiative. — 
James, in stating his third rule for the formation of habit, 
says, “Seize the first possible opportunity to act on every 
resolution you make, and on every emotional prompting 
you may experience in the direction of the habits you aspire 
to gain.”? The writer has usually rephrased it for his 
pupils, — “Practice and create special opportunities for

2 “Principles of Psychology,” p. 124. Holt, 1890.
-P-A-G-E-178
162 HABIT-FORMATION 
practice.” If, then, the teacher wishes the child to have 
this zealous attitude toward practice, almost his only 
recourse is to the reénkindling of the initiative found to 
be effective according to the scheme of the last chapter. 
If the child has sufficient interest and initiative, he will 
continue his practice independently of further spur or sug- 
gestion, until he has mastered the desired ability, whether it 
be to throw a ball accurately, to draw well, to dance, to 
sing well, or to gain other habits. 
If the initiative is not sufficiently strong, it may be 
renewed or it may be reénforced either by other sources of 
initiative or by special suggestion as to times, places, or 
occasions for practice. If the teacher is to furnish the 
occasions when the practice is to take place, the child not 
having sufficient initiative to carry him through, it may be 
done in several ways, as follows: — 
5. The appointment of specified periods for practice. — 
1. Appoint a specified time for practice, and insist upon 
practice during this period. This is the time-honored way 
of securing at least a time-serving practice on some musical 
instrument. The nature of the work done is not now to be 
considered. Time spent in the preparation of a lesson may 
be variously employed. Sometimes it includes time that a 
book or pen is held in the hand regardless of the attention. 
Even the pupil knows the tremendous difference between 
study of that kind and study in which a definite operation 
is performed and a definite result reached. Still it is good 
as far asit goes. There is no chance, when a specified period 
for practice is appointed, for time to slip by in the multitude 
of things to be done and for the practice outlined to be neg- 
lected. Nor should any time be selected regardless of its 
inconvenience for the child. The law of resulting dissatis- 
faction would defeat the end. On the contrary, try 
choose a time that would be.most agreeable. ©
-P-A-G-E-179
METHODS OF SECURING PRACTICE 168 
6. Specifying the number of repetitions. — 2. Specify 
the number of repetitions. 
A principal once gave a certain class three hundred ex- 
amples as a drill in a certain process in fractions. He 
judged that they needed practice, and that with these 
done they would have practice enough. He did it because 
the class worked very slowly. The result was that, whie 
working on the three hundred, almost every member of 
the class did two or three times as many examples as he 
had done before in the same period of time. 
Similarly, in the writing lesson it is better to tell a child 
to repeat his copy a certain number of times than to give 
him the copy and tell him to practice. 
7. Furnishing abundant and agreeable stimuli. — 3. Mul- 
tiply the stimuli provocative of the reaction. If one is 
anxious that a little boy say “thank you” in a pleasing 
way, a game may be arranged in which he is offered various 
objects and makes the appropriate response. Each sepa- 
rate object will serve as a stimulus. If you wish him in 
deference to a lady or an elder to take his hat off as he bows, 
you may suggest all the possible occasions when such a bow 
would be appropriate ; or, if he uses a wrong grammatical 
phrase and you wish to get him accustomed to the right one, 
you can write the correct form in large letters on a piece of 
paper and hang it in his room or where he is likely to see it, 
telling him every time he sees it to think of and speak a 
sentence in which it would belong. 
This furnishing of stimuli should not be interpreted as 
meaning that the child should be constantly reminded. 
“That is too much like nagging on the one hand and shifting 
of responsibility on the other. Whatever stimuli are given, 
the pupil should take upon himself the responsibility for 
making an efficient reaction. 
8. Associating stimuli with the child’s customary acts. —
-P-A-G-E-180
164 HABIT-FORMATION 
4. Make such associations for the stimuli as to keep them 
before the child. No mother can be considered wise who 
keeps her small boy’s toothbrush where he could not see it. 
Rather have it kept as near as possible to the place where 
he is obliged to look every morning when he washes his 
hands and face. Tell him whenever he thinks of or sees 
the place where he brushes his teeth to think of his tooth- 
brush. Interesting rhymes if wisely displayed may also 
serve to connect this habit with the daily routine. Ae- 
cording to the same principle, if every time a boy took a 
pencil or penbolder in his hand, he thought that he must 
keep his back as straight as the pencil; and if, as he 
chanced to look up while he was working, his eyes rested 
on a “roll of honor” including the names of those whose 
backs always kept straight, or pictures of Mr. Straight and 
Mr. Crooked,! or even other children sitting noticeably 
straight, he would improve by the association of those 
stimuli with the stimuli he has already had for writing in 
a good position. 
9. Practice as an outcome of environment. —5. So arrange 
the conditions that the desired reaction and its repetition 
will follow so naturally as to be almost unavoidable. 
The favoring and suggesting environment may be made 
to predispose the child; on the other hand, the environ- 
ment may be made almost prohibitive of the habit. 
It seems sometimes, for example, as if parents and 
teachers deliberately set about making the habit of study, 
i.e. of concentrating the attention in a certain field for a 
considerable time, almost impossible. At home the child 
has to work in the same room with a number of others. If 
callers come in, they are separated only by portiéres or an 
open doorway, from the room where the boy is studying, 
+See Rowe, “Lighting of Schoolrooms,” p. 69. Longmans, 
1904.

METHODS OF SECURING PRACTICE 165 
If the baby cries, it is trotted out to where he is, and very 
likely he is asked to take care of it while his parents are 
engaged in other tasks. He is called upon to run and get 
or deliver this, that, and the other thing with only just time 
enough in between to begin to get his mind down to busi- 
ness. In school, matters are very little better. He is ex- 
pected to study while another class recites in the same 
room, so that unless the teacher be lynx-eyed he is subjected 
to annoying and interrupting calls from neighboring boys 
for mental or material aid. 
This is just the reverse of the requirements for a good 
habit of study, though the exceptional child with a vigorous 
initiative may be able to cope even with such conditions. 
Surely the principle — Make all the conditions such that the 
reaction will take place as naturally as possible — makes 
it necessary to favor the child, giving him every opportunity 
for concentrating his attention and only gradually intro- 
ducing him to the more diverting and distracting conditions. 
If neatness in papers is desired, pave the way by having 
the children hold up the hands to show that they are 
clean, by advocating the liberal and systematic use of the 
blotter, by warnings against spooning up the ink with the 
pen, and by other precautions making it easier than not for 
the child to write and keep his paper clean. After a while 
a soiled copy will be an eyesore to him, and he will himself 
find measures to guard against such possibilities.t

Bagley reports that he did not find keeping the paper clean in

themselves to similar situations. See p. 208 of his “Educative 
Process.” New York, 1905.

renewal. That is, freshen up on the habit. One must 
“keep his hand in” is perhaps the ordinary form in which 
the principle finds expression. An objector might cite 
Professor James’s paradox of our learning to skate in summer 
and learning to swim in winter as an argument for dropping 
practice for a time. This, however, is a special case, and is 
to be explained as the result of over-stimulation in the 
season for those sports producing a general waste of energy 
and lack of ability to attend to fine points, which time only 
can repair. The obvious verdict of experience is that it is 
necessary to keep in practice, to react occasionally along the 
line of any special habit of action or memory just for the 
sake of facilitating our responses. Consequently the expert 
musician, vocalist or instrumentalist, allows no considerable 
time to intervene without practice. Writing is continued 
long after the child secures a fair degree of proficiency, 
though often too much of the slow, labored, impractical sort 
of writing is drilled upon when an easy, legible, and char- 
acteristic handwriting is the real requirement. 
1x. Decadence of neglected habits. — Even such funda- 
mental habits as walking, running, and even jumping, 
as promoted by active games, are often lost, as far as any 
real efficiency or buoyancy is concerned, by men and women 
only approaching middle age, simply because they do not 
keep themselves “in condition.” Women (and teachers as 
well) frequently reach the decrepitude of advanced years! 
long before there is any excuse for it, except that they have 
violated the principle and practice of keeping active. It is 
1Crampton, in the Pedagogical Seminary (Vol. XV., p. 230), 
suggests an interesting distinction between a child’s physiological 
age and his chronological age. Is not the old adage more nearly 
expressive of adult age which says that “a woman is as young 
as she looks, a man as young as he feels,” i.e. acts? The difference 
in one’s actions or habits is after all the mark of age rather than 
lapse of years.

not often that a woman (or man)-over sixty runs upstairs. 
For some reason, perhaps a good one at the time, practice 
was interrupted and later was never renewed, though the 
original reason for the interruption had long since been 
removed. 
12. Practice must be actual, not perfunctory. — It is 
evident that the purpose in all of the above devices is simply 
to get the child practicing, and the quality of the practice is 
not particularly regarded. The next consideration must 
therefore be the principle that practice must be real practice 
and not the form without the substance. It is evident to 
any one acquainted with children that in spite of good 
intentions their shortsightedness is nowhere better illus- 
trated than in their failure to keep themselves up to earnest, 
well-directed practice, even where they have made a good 
beginning. 
_Ebbinghaus,! Jost,? and others have noticed that the 
distribution of practice over intervals of time was advan- 
tageous. This is to be accounted for rather by the dis- 
advantages of crowding practice on the other plan, so that it 
became not actual, but perfunctory. 
The devices. which go to making practice not merely 
formal, but actual, are suggested by the following maxims: — 
13. The renewing of initiative. — 1. Use devices designed 
to recall to vividness the relation of the desired habit to 
the child’s initiative. It is not enough to gain an initiative 
at the start; but, if practice is to be secured and especially 
if it is to be secured effectively, constant reminders of the 
good intentions are desirable. 
For example, a person who wishes to make sure of a

Verteilung der Wiederholungen,” Zeitschrift fiir Psychologie, Vol. 
XIV., p. 436.
-P-A-G-E-184
168 HABIT-FORMATION 
certain formula might, in order to promote practice of the - 
right sort, put a memorandum on his desk, at the sight of 
which he would repeat the formula. A clergyman who 
wished to speak more distinctly would write a big “S. D.” 
in thin pencil across his manuscript to remind him to 
continue in his effort to improve. 
14. A definite degree of skill or facility as the pupil’s aim. 
—2. Have the child understand that a certain degree of 
skill or facility must be attained, or that certain tests 
must indisputably confirm his success. Children often 
show some ability in other ways, but fall behind their 
classes in some of the automatic processes of arithmetic. 
In many instances investigated by the author, the children 
seemed not to grasp the necessity of getting these autom- 
atisms quickly. When asked, for example, how many 
are 7X8, there was usually considerable hesitation or per- 
haps no response. Their attention was called to the fact, 
and they were given 4X6. Results were perhaps some- 
what better. After a few other combinations had been 
given, they were asked to give 22, and the reply came 
instantly with every indication of automatism. Then they 
were told to get all the multiplication facts by a certain 
date as well as they had 22, and they knew then definitely 
just what degree of facility was expected of them, and would 
often return by the date with the facts learned. 
Similarly, if children in lower grades knew that all we 
wanted was a well-established ability to write neatly, legibly, 
and at a fair rate of speed, it would not take eight years 
of practice to develop a handwriting finally of no use 
except for show occasions. The ordinary habit of the child 
is to write hastily and carelessly, while the habit of writing 
very, very slowly and carefully, producing well-formed 
letters, is practiced only on such occasions as the hurried 
habit of writing is debarred. These are two very different
-P-A-G-E-185
METHODS OF SECURING PRACTICE 169 
habits. Much of school drill in writing misses the mark 
because the show-writing habit is the only one taught, while 
the ordinary handwriting is developed or left undeveloped 
by the pupil as he sees fit. In other words, in teaching 
writing we too often attempt to secure habits we don’t want 
and very seldom aim definitely at the habit we do want. 
In the same way, preliminary work in Latin, Greek, or 
other languages should furnish the child not only with the 
understanding of the structure of the language, but also 
with the habit of systematically placing and interpreting 
the forms encountered. Correct habits of translation are 
seriously endangered under ordinary school conditions, 
if involved translation is begun before there is any auto- 
matic thinking of the uses of forms or any habit of think- 
ing down through a list of possibilities for the usage found 
in this particular sentence. Habits of translation should 
be established of two sorts. Given a word in a certain case, 
not only should the various uses appear automatically, but, 
what is even more important, the ways of translating so 
as to bring out most effectively those uses should become 
available as a matter of habit. Otherwise the child takes 
the words in their order and puzzles out the best sense 
he can make, regardless of cases, and often with most 
astonishing results, as instanced by a boy who translated 
@ passage from. Xenophon: ‘And they all were looking 
sorrowfully on the ground with their heads cut off.” 
15. Earnestness and effort a necessity of practice. — 
3. Encourage the child to earnestness and effort in his 
practice. He should be alert both for points at which he 
ean improve and for ways of improving at those points. 
It is very easy for the child in the multitude of directions 
given him to fall into a certain laxity and a laissez-faire 
attitude in sheer self-defense. He will often need a little 
jostling mentally to get him out of his sleepy condition.
-P-A-G-E-186
170 HABIT-FORMATION 
Show him how many special difficulties are lurking in this 
habit waiting to catch him, and get him on the lookout for 
them. In mathematics, if we do not keep our wits about us, 
we are easily led astray by some misapplied automatism. 
The writer once heard a company of children singing a 
multiplication table to the tune of Yankee Doodle. Com- 
binations ridiculously incorrect were sung. As practice 
(which it was supposed to be) it was the worst of failures. 
If the child tries, and tries hard, to get a habit quickly, 
more accurately, or easily, the practice will mean something. 
This is evidently very difficult unless one has already se- 
cured a strong and decided initiative. Moreover, en- 
courage him to study and concentrate on the hard points, 
the places where energy and effort are needed. The piano 
practice of most small children yields pitiably small results, 
because they play over the parts of pieces, which they know, 
and fail to put in the time at the points where they have 
difficulty. . 
Experiment is what we really mean when we say “try.” 
When we say “ try hard,” we mean experiment in every way 
possible for the pupil to devise. Inthe child’s effort much 
of the experimentation may be below the level of his con- 
scious action. He just tries. 
This earnestness and effort are only possible when the 
physical condition of the child is healthy and unfatigued. 
The investigations of Woodworth and Swift,? together 
with the general experience of athletes, all combine to 
show that practice carried beyond the fatigue point is 
disastrous. Attention flags and undesirable variations 
creep in and become more or less permanent according 
1 Woodworth, “The Accuracy of Voluntary Movement,” Psy- 
chological Review Monograph Supplement, No. 13, 1899, pp. 1-114.

Journal of Psychology, Vol. XIV., pp. 216-223.

as they are discovered and counteracted or in their turn 
yield to further variations. The college ball nine starts 
out promisingly, but “goes stale.” The tennis expert 
practices so much that he “gets way off his game.” + 
Over-practice not only causes inattention, but makes 
some form of misdirection of attention-processes har 
bitual, and with that fixes as habits all subconsciously 
made variations in the reaction itself. Woodworth? is 
tight in his insistence that practice must be successful for 
the best results. Johnson® says that his results show that 
“a short exercise often repeated is the best method of 
practice for rapid development of accurate adjustment 
of muscles. Long practice in writing, drawing, etc., 
seems to be time and energy wasted. Not only are in- 
attentive habits‘ cultivated, but every wrong adjustment 
gains a place in the chain of subconscious memories, and 
therefore delays the development of the control over the 
muscles for accurate adjustments.” 
16. The direction of attention to special points. — 
4, Show the child, if there is danger of his being unable 
to find them himself, the definite points to which he 
must attend or to which special attention must be given.>

4Johnson’s term “inattentive habits” is subject to criticism. 
One cannot have an inattentive habit any more than he can “pay 
inattention.” Bad habits of attention are really meant. 
5 The necessity of attention for selecting the better reactions 
(i.e. more satisfactory) is illustrated by Professor Thorndike in an 
experiment which he describes as follows: “Close your eyes and 
write as well as you can with your left hand (right hand if you 
use the left ordinarily) some sentence of about eight or ten words. 
Keep the eyes closed and repeat the writing twenty times without
-P-A-G-E-188
172 HABIT-FORMATION 
When a class of pupils is given a new letter or word 
to write, it is not enough merely to have the children 
earnest and eager in their attempts, but much can be 
done in the presentation of the habit to point out the 
precise points to be watched. The teacher’s own trials 
or his experience shows him, for example, that the chil- 
dren will fail to close the small “a” at the top, or will 
overdo it. The children should profit by being warned 
to close the space exactly. 
Much of the point of studying the nature of the re- 
action advocated in Chapter VII has, aside from its 
general value, its application in enabling the teacher to 
point out all through practice just the difficulties need- 
ing attention, and in helping the child to keep them promi- 
nent in his own mind. There are few habits— memory, 
muscular, or both —in which we cannot pick out, if we 
are able to analyze them at all, the special word, the 
twist of the thumb, the swing of the arm, or the move- 
ment of the eye which is one of the stumbling-blocks to 
reaching perfection in that reaction. In playing the “C” 
major scale on the piano, for example, it is easy enough 
to play the first three notes with the thumb and two 
fingers, but then the learner must slip his thumb under 
the fingers and play four more, then slip the thumb under 
again, and so every three, and then four, notes. This 
strange little habit of slipping the thumb under must 
seeing the results. In each case write as well as you can. Num- 
ber the sheets in order 1 to 21. Then write twenty copies (still 
with the left hand) with eyes open, in each case writing as well 
as you can. Number them 22 to 41. In which case did you im- 
prove in the practice, from 1 to 21 or in the practice from 22 to 41? 
Why?” Thorndike, “Principles of Teaching,” p. 231. Seiler,

function at just the right time to the hundredth of a 
second. In playing scales, these then are the points of 
attention. 
Any sort of way of getting these crucial elements writ 
large with the object of securing the sharpest possible 
focus, will be successful. Clearness is gained by the analy- 
sis of the intricacies of the habit. Not only is attention 
directed to the point of difficulty, and so made more 
effective, but repetition is made possible in minor details 
which would otherwise -be inevitably slighted. 
17. Desirability of the method admitting of the most 
actual practice. — 5. For habit-getting use the method 
admitting of the greatest possibility of actual practice. 
By possibility is here meant possibility considering the 
whole situation. 
If anybody advertises to teach a person to speak 
German by his wonderful method in six lessons, put him 
down as a fakir. He can teach just about as much in 
that time as a parrot could absorb. To speak German 
or any other language, a large amount of practice is neces- 
sary. It is quite obvious that the way of getting the 
greatest. amount of practice in speaking German is to go 
where the only language heard and the only language by 
which one may be understood is German. The practice 
must be obtained, and no matter how stupid one is, he 
learns to speak the language without regard to the suffer- 
ing of the natives. 
For similar reasons, learning to swim by correspondence 
is not profitable, unless the whole burden of the corre- 
spondence is “Get into the water and strike out, not car- 
ing whether you are on top of the water or at the bottom.” 
In all habit-getting any method that really secures 
actual intelligent practice is a good one. It is hoped the 
difficulty of providing such a form of practice will be
-P-A-G-E-190
174 HABIT-FORMATION 
overcome more generally with the aid of the principles 
here set forth. 
18. Psychological experiment and practice. — The writer 
has endeavored in this chapter to include and to sum 
up in the principles stated the contribution of the ex- 
perimentalists. It is especially here in the relation to 
practice that the experimental psychologists have con- 
tributed most to the methodology of habit. The use 
made of the experiments seems meager compared with 
the labor involved in a single investigation, but it must 
be borne in mind that each experiment, no matter how 
suggestive it may be, is too specific in itself to admit of 
generalization, until it has been brought into relation 
with others, and in much more complex conditions than 
those serving the experimenters’ purposes as yet. The 
mere complexity of conditions involved in the school and 
home life of the child implies in itself so many more 
factors than are to be found in the experimental records 
as to make it quite possible that a general principle valid 
under laboratory conditions would be offset by counter 
principles growing out of other factors in the school- 
room. In time, doubtless to complete the methodology 
of practice, an experimental will be combined with an 
empirical basis. Neither the pedagogue in his observa- 
tions nor the psychologist in his experiment can afford 
to ignore these foundations of -habit-forming. Where the 
psychologist leaves off, the advocate of experimental 
pedagogy must begin. To him the field of habit is offered 
as worthy of his best efforts.

19. Summary.— Repetition is the desideratum of 
practice. It must be neither inattentive nor too varied 
in character, but instead the same neural path must be 
traversed with attention and effort, until automatic 
action is established. Intensity or interest increases the 
number of associations, and thus promotes the frequency 
of repetition. 
The amount of repetition depends on the nature of 
the habit, and must be determined by experience. Prac 
tice which falls short of producing the habit is largely 
wasted. 
The practice must be thoughtful, earnest, and atten- 
tive. The attitude toward the practice should be one of 
zeal and eagerness not only to seize upon opportunities 
presenting themselves, but also to create opportunities 
for practice. A strong initiative is the only hope that 
we have that the child will bring about for himself occa- 
sions for practice. 
If the initiative first aroused is not sufficient of itself, 
it must be-called into play as often as effective use may 
be-made of it. Where the initiative is not adequate to 
securing the desired practice, the teacher may furnish 
stimuli or occasions for practicing the form of the re- 
action. This may be done in any or all of six ways:— 
1. Appoint a specified period for practice, and insist 
upon practice during that period.

its relation to habit directly, or much more often in its relation to 
memory, see under: Angell, Bair, Berger, Bolton, Bourdon,

Gilbert and Fracker, Johnson, Jost, Judd, Kennedy, Miller, 
Netschajeff, Reuther, Smith, Stein, Thorndike, Volkman, Winch, 
and Woodworth. For those investigations dealing more particu- 
larly with preventing exceptions or the conditions under which 
exceptions arise, see Bawden, Stein, and Vogt.

2. Specify the number of repetitions. 
3. Multiply the stimuli provocative of the reaction. 
4, Make such associations as will keep suggesting the 
habit to the child. 
5. So arrange the conditions that the desired reaction 
and its repetition must naturally follow. 
6. Secure facility of reaction by making the practice 
recent. 
In guarding against the grave danger of the child’s 
practice being formal rather than actual, the devices sug- 
gested are: — 
1. Use devices designed to make vivid the relation of 
the desired habit to the child’s initiative. 
2. Have the pupil understand that a certain definite 
degree of skill or facility must be attained, or that certain 
tests must confirm his success indisputably. 
3. Encourage the child to earnestness and effort in his 
practice. 
4, Show the child the definite points to which he must 
attend. 
5. Use the method of securing habits admitting of the 
greatest possibilities of practice.

Mersops oF PREVENTING EXCEPTIONS 
“Even the worthy Homer sometimes nods.” — Horacz. 
“So take and use thy work : 
Amend what flaws may lurk, 
What strain o’ the stuff, what warpings past the aim!” 
— Brownina. 
1. The danger of exceptions. — Professor Bain, in his 
“Psychology of the Emotions,” in speaking of the forma- 
tion of the habit of getting up at a certain time every morn- 
ing, writes: “I cannot doubt that there is such a thing as 
literally starving a very acute pleasurable or painful sen- 
sibility, by crossing it, or systematically discouraging it. 
So that on both sides the force of iteration is softening 
down the harsh experience of the early riser, and bringing 
about, as time advances, an approach to the final con- 
dition of mechanical punctuality and entire indifference. 
Years may be wanted to arrive at this point, but sooner 
or later the plastic element of our constitution will suc- 
ceed. Not, however, I think, without the two main 
conditions of an adequate initiative and an unbroken 
persistence.”’ 
In these sentences Bain has summed up the require- 
ments of a methodology of habit in apparently two points. 
But an analysis of the last shows immediately that it 
not only implies the practice insisted upon in the last 
chapter, but that persistence in practice should be un- 
broken, i.e. free from exceptions, lapses, and the like. 
17
-P-A-G-E-194
178 HABIT-FORMATION 
His very next sentence atones for the apparent neglect 
of the disintegrating power of exceptions by adding: 
“Tf the power applied in the first instance is inconstant 
or merely occasional, and if periods of indulgence are 
admitted to break the career of the learner, there is very 
little hope of ever attaining the consummation desired. 
Professor James has illustrated this very aptly by 
comparing the exception to the dropping of a ball of 
twine which is being wound. The mischievous tendency 
of the ball to unwind much that already had been wound, 
is illustrative of the mischief accomplished by every 
lapse from the pathway of the habit. 
2. The two sources of exceptions. — The sources of ex- 
ception to any definite habit in course of formation must 
be found in some change in the circumstances. Either 
the initiative which made possible the first efforts has 
materially weakened, or a new stimulation opposed to the 
habit has come prominently into the situation engross- 
ing the attention and displacing the stimulation favor- 
able to the desired habit. Recognizing the likelihood of 
either of these possible changes becoming actual, a scheme 
for eliminating exceptions must make general provision 
for these two kinds of contingency in whatever form they 
may arise. 
A child may be on the point of developing a very good 
slant in his handwriting when an example of an extreme 
1 Bain, “Feeling and the Will,” p. 458. London, 1865. 
2“®ach lapse is like the letting fall of a bail of string which 
one is carefully winding up; a single slip undoes more than a 
great many turns will wind up again. Continuity in training is 
the great means of making the various systems act infallibly right.” 
James, “Principles of Psychology,” p. 123. New York, 1890. 
* For a study of exceptions and variations from habits already 
formed, see Bawden, “Study of Lapses” in the Psychological 
Review Monograph Supplement, Vol. III., No. 4, pp. 1-122.
-P-A-G-E-195
METHODS OF PREVENTING EXCEPTIONS 179 
backhand slant happens to be brought to his notice. It 
is new and striking, appeals to him by its individuality, 
and before the teacher knows it he has begun seriously 
to lapse from a habit almost established. So, too, a new 
and striking handwriting, though suggested by the 
imagination or experiment, may easily prove a sufficient 
stimulation to start a new habit path. This illustrates 
the change wrought by an opposing stimulus. 
In case of a determination to get up at a certain time 
each morning, the attempt goes well until a morning 
comes following a night of comparative sleeplessness. 
Then attention is given the tendency to finish the sleep 
and not to the initiative, which hardly reaches conscious- 
ness at all. 
These two sources of exception to, or modification of, 
the habit in the process of formation, the weakened 
initiative and the opposing stimuli, make the prevention 
of exceptions no less difficult than securing abundant 
practice. They necessitate a knowledge of the springs 
of initiative in the child, and a knowledge both of the 
stimuli favorable to the habit and of those opposed to its 
development but likely to be associated with the favoring 
stimuli. 
In this phase of securing habit, therefore, great skill is 
required, and the more definitely the habit is studied and 
understood by the teacher, the better equipped he will 
be to do his duty at this point. Of the methods of pre- 
venting exceptions, first those looking to the removal of 
the sources of exception will be suggested, and then they 
will be followed by those principles safeguarding the 
child against such as cannot be removed. 
3. Need of studying tendencies to modification. — 
1. Study the habit with all its likely tendencies to 
modification. Of all the devices to be borne in mind
-P-A-G-E-196
180 HABIT-FORMATION 
to anticipate or counteract the possibility of modifying 
a habit, emphasis should be laid on this first analy- 
sis and study of the habit, even though it has been in- 
sisted upon in Chapter VIII and again in Chapter IX. 
The variations from slant form of letters and the cor- 
responding mode of joining them make penmanship one 
of the most evident illustrations of the need of knowing 
these tendencies. The child’s constant tendency to 
adapt his degree of obedience to the necessities of the 
situation from the point of view of the minimum, is an- 
other evident case. The parent or teacher who knows 
the kind of obedience he intends to have, and does not 
tolerate first steps in the direction of exceptions, will 
have little trouble. 
4. Reénforcement of uncertain initiative.—2. Reén- 
force, by especial support at the point or time of weak- 
ness, an initiative which is likely to fade. 
If one who wishes to form a habit of getting up early 
each morning, reénforces his intentions with an alarm 
clock and the services of an athletic friend, his chances of 
getting up at the time set are good. 
If a child that is habitually truthful is put in a position 
of special stress by his teacher, a lapse from the habit 
may occur; but, if the teacher recognizes this fact and 
the child is made to feel the dependence placed upon him, 
the pleasure his honesty gave his teacher and his parents, 
and the foolishness of throwing away this good opinion, 
the child’s initiative will probably have all the backing 
necessary to carry him safely over the treacherous ground. 
A music teacher teaching a child unable to sing the scale, 
the point being reached where the pupil is inclined to 
balk, may point up vigorously with his finger and say 
kindly but firmly, “Up on your toes.” This is both re- 
minding the child and reénforcing his initiative. Such
-P-A-G-E-197
NN A A 9 
NN mee ye METHODS OF PREVENTING EXCEPTIONS 181 
combinations of appeal may often be effected very ad- 
vantageously. Some of the most skillful work the author 
has seen in the schoolroom has been due largely to the 
ability of the teacher to keep constantly before the child 
his intention to do his best; that is, to throw conscious 
effort into his work. It was not done by calling work 
to a halt from time to time, and saying, “Remember, 
children, each one is to do his best”; but by a constant 
running fire of suggestion or favorable comment here, a 
mild and judicious criticism there, a significant look, or 
a tap of the pencil, — all effective, though so thoroughly 
interspersed in the teaching process as to be no intrusion 
of the discipline into the instruction. 
5. Removal of stimuli. — 3. Remove, if possible, stimuli 
that menace the habit. Although this is in fact quite 
impossible, at times, often it is very feasible. Association 
only with people who use good English may not be pos- 
sible for many, but it will certainly be a great help .to 
the child in acquiring correct habits of speech. Good 
examples of language, literature, art, and music should be 
at least the aim of the schoolroom, so that no unworthy 
stimuli may contribute there to unfortunate habits of 
expression. In discipline, one ingenious and mischievous 
boy may, if allowed to go unnoticed by the teacher, fur- 
nish stimuli for more sorts of tricks and exceptions to 
habits of study and attention than a teacher could rid 
himself of in a term, — all unnecessary, if the originator 
can only have his originality turned into more desirable 
channels, and at the same time be given in another way 
a resulting satisfaction equivalent to that found in the 
admiration of his daring and ingenuity by the less dis- 
orderly youngsters. 
6. Fatigue as a stimulus to modification. — It is doubt- 
less true in games as well as work involving the highest
-P-A-G-E-198
182 HABIT-FORMATION 
skill that to play or work when fatigued is to run the 
chance of some little omission here, a cue missed or mis- 
taken there, just enough to make uncertain the habit 
path. Keeping within the limits of what can safely be 
done, avoids this danger.* 
The athlete who gets “stale” is making exceptions 
just as truly as he who breaks training. So, long tasks 
imposed, notes to be taken, and the like may become 
stimuli to exceptions. Work of this sort, therefore, 
should be brought down to the limits of what can be 
done reasonably in a given time. Is it not possible that 
the lack of habits of thoughtful study so common in our 
higher institutions is a direct result of the crowding of 
the studies in the grammar grade and high school periods? 
7. The weakening of stimulii—4. Reduce to the 
minimum stimuli opposed to the habit. Even if they 
cannot be removed, they, may be made less cogent or 
compelling. Consequently, this is a more practicable 
maxim than the one preceding it, and the illustrations in 
modified form may already suggest themselves as fully 
appropriate here. Children must inevitably know of 
cases of disobedience in their schoolmates. But, if they 
do not see disobedience going unpunished, they will not 
get data (in the way of apparent satisfaction without 
deterrents) to act as stimuli to much experimentation in 
a similar direction for themselves. If they do not read 
books about pirates and Indian fighting, they will be 
less likely to wish to break away from the peaceful habits 
of the ordinary citizen. In arithmetic the too frequent 
hurry to complicated processes before the pupil has 
mastered the separate subordinate facts, leads him to

guesses resulting in a wrong tendency which suggests a 
similar reaction on the next occasion. 
Any expedients by which bad examples may be re- 
moved; undesirable excitants to the imagination lessened, 
hurry and worry minimized, that fatigue may be avoided, 
and a thousand other possibilities of similar tendency, — 
all these must contribute to the prevention of exceptions 
to desirable habits. 
8. The checking of variation.—5. When the habit has 
reached its maximum efficiency, guard against further 
variation by special commendation of the reaction. 
The tendency of the child to vary his action even ex- 
perimentally and often without consciousness of it, Pro- 
fessor Baldwin’s principle of “accommodation,” ! often 
results in the discovery of new stimuli and new paths of 
reaction, which not only constitute the basis of the golfer’s 
improvement, but also when he has reached good form 
and is trying for still better things, explains his losing 
ground again. Children are constantly imitating, con- 
stantly inventing and making a new accommodation or 
adaptation to the given situation. These little varia- 
tions are a tremendous help to the child in achieving a 
habit; but if the habit has once taken form and been 
perfected, they become very mischievous. On this ac- 
count a high degree of accuracy and facility having been 
reached, it would be wise to call the child’s attention to 
that form of reaction and tell him to make all the others 
like that. It will not do to call too much attention at 
that time to the stages of, or factors in, the reaction itself, 
as that only tends to make variations, which are evi- 
dently undesirable when the reaction has already been 
safely reached or almost reached as an automatism.

184 HABIT-FORMATION 
Practice is, of course, not to be relinquished; but, 
whereas its aim is a greater degree of proficiency before 
the reaction is perfected, now it is rather to keep up the 
proficiency already attained. This, of course, applies more 
especially to the more subtle points in teaching. A 
musical tone or a French “u” may be difficult for the 
child. He tries and, after practice, gets nearer and 
nearer to it. His teacher finally hears exactly the right 
sound, and says, “That’s it.’ —“ Keep that up.” — “Do 
that again,” and so on. The child’s attention is called 
to the result and the general feeling of the process. If 
he can retain it, he has mastered the reaction, and only 
needs more practice to make it automatic. 
9. The elimination of difficult points. —6. Simplify re- 
actions and rid them of special points of difficulty by secur- 
ing smaller contributing habits before the more complex 
are attempted. In the chapter on methods of practice, 
one of the maxims to be observed was “Show the child 
the definite points to attend or to which special atten- 
tion must be given.” Here it is not to direct the atten- 
tion but rather to take a habit, analyze it into its parts, 
and then direct practice to those parts themselves until 
sufficient skill has been achieved to warrant the addition 
of the rest of the reaction desired. 
In attempting to get the habit of neatness in writing 
with ink, the first essential is that the child see to it that 
his hands are clean. But there are other essentials. If 
he has the habit of spooning up the ink, a drop is almost 
certain to fall from the pen when it is held vertically. 
If he holds his pen so that only one point touches the 
paper, he is almost certain to scratch and throw little 
specks of ink all over his paper, which are likely to be 
rubbed soon into bad blots. For neat penmanship, the 
habit of dipping the pen properly and that of holding it

  METHODS OF PREVENTING EXCEPTIONS 185 
correctly are second only to cleanliness of hands and 
effective use of the blotter. Four subordinate contribut- 
ing habits are to be secured, therefore, before the one 
habit of neatness in written work can be expected. 
Again, in keeping an absolutely fixed time on the piano 
it is often desirable to use a metronome. It enables the 
pianist to keep the time when otherwise there might be 
many unnoticed points of hesitation. 
Another application of this sixth maxim is found in 
the teaching of English. It is a great help to the child 
to divide up his composition work into three sorts, — de- 
scription, exposition, and narration, — getting started on 
the important habits fundamental to each separately, and 
then finally thinking habitually and even subconsciously 
in all literary work of these three possibilities and decid- 
ing which is involved or to what degree elements of one 
are combined in a part or the whole of another, as the 
various phases of the writing change. 
to. The use of inhibition. — In the remaining half of 
this chapter we are to deal with the answer to the ques- 
tion, “But what can be done when the weakened initia- 
tive, the opposing stimuli, and the tendencies to vary can 
be counteracted only in part or not at all?” The only 
answer to this question is, ‘‘Awaken the child’s inhibitive 
tendencies.” 
We are often conscious of holding ourselves in check 
or of restraining ourselves, of refraining from an action 
sometimes for good reasons, often because some vague 
element in the situation suggests just enough of strange- 
ness or uncertainty or of caution to lead to a checking of 
the tendency for a moment’s further investigation. 
1 An excellent example of this is shown in Jacob Riis’s “ Auto- 
biography of an American.” New York, 1900. He was on the 
point of shooting an obnoxious white dog which had apparently
-P-A-G-E-202
186 HABIT-FORMATION 
A boy with hand uplifted about to throw a wad of 
paper across the room sees the eyes of his teacher-turned 
his way. The movement is immediately checked, and 
to disguise the meaning of the uplifted hand he begins 
to smooth his hair. This halting of the movement is an 
act of inhibition. The stimulus to this act of inhibition 
was the teacher’s glance. The reaction was the move- 
ment of muscles checking the originally intended reaction. 
The motive, or reason, or initiative for the inhibitory 
act was the consciousness of the disapproval, humiliation, 
or other punishment that would result from throwing the 
paper, the source of this incentive being in the instincts 
and emotions. 
By inhibition is meant, then, the process of checking 
any imminent tendency to act. It may result in a tem- 
porary negation of action, or more usually combined with 
that, as in the above illustration, is the substitution of 
another form of reaction (there the smoothing of the 
hair) for the one intended. In preventing exceptions to 
the habit pathway, evidently the reaction to be substi- 
tuted is that of the habit itself. Consequently, the use 
of inhibition will be limited to the possibilities it affords 
of resisting undesirable tendencies to make exceptions, 
whether they arise from opposing stimuli or tendencies 
to variation. 
uz. The stimuli and motive of inhibition. — This check- 
ing tendency, this inhibition, must have a motive and a 
stimulus of its own, even as the habit itself. It implies a 
taken refuge in a lumber pile in the dusk of the evening, when 
his finger was stayed on the trigger, and the white object proved 
to be the shirt sleeve of a man with whom he had had trouble 
that very morning. Had he shot the man, he would almost cer- 
tainly have been convicted on circumstantial evidence of intent 
to kill.
-P-A-G-E-203
RR Soe 
  METHODS OF PREVENTING EXCEPTIONS 187 
positive reaction, if it is to counteract or check positive 
tendencies, and must be dependent, therefore, both on 
its own stimuli and its own initiative as involved in the 
mind-set with all its factors of intensity, of recency, of 
resulting satisfaction, of previous mental attitudes, and, 
to a certain extent, therefore, on the number of times the 
tendency has been put in practice. 
What is to call forth this inhibition? Plainly the ex- 
citation must be the consciousness either of a new stimu- 
lus, which has crept into the general situation, or of a 
new or unintended tendency in the course of the re- 
action. The remedy must consist in developing in the 
student alertness to discover the new element in the 
situation or the variation in the reaction, and then to 
fortify himself against hostile tendencies. Accordingly, 
to save the child from lapses there are two modes of 
procedure. 
12, Guarding against probable temptations. — 1. Make 
plain the fact that certain variations either in the situa- 
tion or the reaction are likely to occur, that they are 
temptations, and must be overcome. 
In sewing, as soon as an unevenness in the stitches ap- 
pears, or when an increasing irregularity is discovered, 
these departures from the standard must be heralded by 
the pupil as temptations threatening the habit on which 
the quality of the work depends. Evidently they repre- 
sent variations in the reaction. 
Children may be well on the way toward a habit of 
taking a last glance at the word just written to make 
certain that it corresponds to their intention. Written 
work is prescribed that must be done in a hurry. The 
new element in this situation, hurry, if not diagnosed as 
a temptation, may lead the child to save time at the 
expense of taking the glance. In that case exception
-P-A-G-E-204
188 HABIT-FORMATION 
has occurred. He must recognize as a distinct tempta- 
tion to lapse, either the hurry or the tendency to omit 
the glance, and so vary the reaction. This recognition of 
the danger should be followed by a definite resolution 
not to yield. 
In getting the habit of hesitating to write a word until 
he is certain of the spelling, a pupil may recognize the 
tendency to guess rather than consult an authority as a 
definite trial of his strength likely, if not resisted, to lead 
him to a habit of guessing without his noticing the fact 
at all. . 
In almost any branch of study, —arithmetic, history, 
geography, grammar, and the like, — instances occur where 
the tendency to guess should be recognized or discovered, 
— instances where smooth automatic action should take 
place, but does not. Many a teacher of history, for ex- 
ample, has to look up on each occasion the names of the 
official positions in the President’s Cabinet. This list 
should be made automatic, even if the changing per- 
sonalities are not. The failure to make sure of these as 
soon as any of them have been forgotten, should be re- 
garded as a temptation to lapse from a habit of thorough- 
ness very desirable in a teacher. 
A man who can become a really great financial leader 
must be conseious of his own integrity in relation to 
affairs involving money. But this consciousness of his 
own integrity may lead him to a similar confidence in 
his judgment as to the moral quality of practices such as 
getting around unjust laws or taking chances on their 
enforcement. Success and power do not ordinarily sensi- 
tize men either to their weaknesses or their limitations. 
An indication of such weakness is that warping of con- 
science which makes it possible for a legislator to accept 
money directly or indirectly for voting privileges to a
-P-A-G-E-205
METHODS OF PREVENTING EXCEPTIONS 189 
corporation, though he reason that the community is to 
be benefited and that he should vote for the measure in 
any case. The offer of the official of the corporation is 
no less indicative of moral limitation. The first tendencies 
to lapse from a habit often come in disguise, but usually 
the disguise is very thin. 
In this connection a very clear warning must be given 
against suggesting to the child variations and temptations 
which he would never have thought of, if not suggested. 
The mistake of the teacher who told her class of ten-year- 
old boys not to stumble on the stairs, is evident. 
13. Warning against first tendencies to lapse. — 2. Put 
the pupil on his guard against the first tendency to lapse. 
This rule is a corollary of the one preceding. If varia- 
tion tendencies in the habit are to be guarded against, . 
certainly the first tendency in that direction should be 
noted and inhibited before it has a chance for repetition. 
But it is not the mere avoidance of repetition and jeop- 
ardy of the habit that is the danger; with that is 
combined a clogging of the habit machinery out of all 
proportion to what would otherwise be the importance of 
the exception. 
Children who have been made sensitive to these first 
tendencies will not write a dozen copies. each a little 
worse than the preceding. 
Blots and soiled spots on papers will be recognized as 
dangerous; first stretches of the truth, temptations to 
leave things in disorder, to disturb others, and the like 
will all be recognized as evils, but also as stimuli to in- 
hibition. One of the most important and difficult func- 
tions of the teacher is to assist the child at the critical 
moment when the tendency is just on the point.of worst- 
ing him; and fundamental to this effort is the habit of 
noticing the first indications of a failure to attend, of
-P-A-G-E-206
190 HABIT-FORMATION 
subtle friction tendencies, or of incipient counter attrac- 
tions. Many teachers fail through an inability to see 
their classes, not because of defects of sight, but through 
lack of sufficient alertness to keep track of the children 
who are not included in the group with which they are 
concerned at the moment. If disorder is seen, the teacher’s 
best judgment can indicate what is to be done about it; 
but what is to happen when it is not seen? 
14. Positive and negative initiative. — From the stand- 
point of enlisting initiative toward inhibitory tendencies, 
it must be borne in mind that the positive initiative le:4 
ing to the habit will itself serve as initiative (of : 
tive sort) for the inhibition of contrary acts. Bv. 
from that negative sort of initiative, it often bu. uw 
that some instinct plainly involves the inhibition as truly 
as jealousy inhibits sympathy, or that emotions, in’ 
and disagreeableness of the failure to inhibit may 
action. In fact, any motive may contribute dire 
the act of inhibition. With these two considerat: 
mind, the five points following will explain themse..... 
15. Resolving against lapses.—1. Prepare for recog- 
nition of the danger by leading the child to make a 
definite resolve against lapses in general, and particularly 
of the sort feared. Enlist his persistence, effort, and 
determination not to be beaten; and, when he begins to 
get discouraged at the difficulty of this bit of fingering 
on the violin or piano, or even at succeeding in making 
his various lines meet at the same point in mechanical 
drawing, he will recognize that this is the time of trial, 
when he is to show the kind of stuff he is made of. 
In writing he may be forming the habit of using variety 
of expression. The situation calls for a word used before. 
In spite of the tendency to continue with the same word, 
as a result of his previous resolution, he tries, rather
-P-A-G-E-207
  METHODS OF PREVENTING EXCEPTIONS 191 
than give in, all the resources at his command, until he 
finds a new expression or is convinced that there is no 
" way of substituting for the word in either sentence. 
A college boy has been warned against the use of 
translations, and has resolved that he will persist in 
making his own translations. An inexperienced in- 
structor gives out an impossible lesson and the students 
generally go and secure translations. If anything’is to 
save him from lapsing from his habit, it will not be an 
unreénforced initiative, but the resolution made to pro- 
vide against just such a contingency. 
16. Preventing exceptions by combining positive and 
negative initiative. 2. Connect by a special provision 
the inhibiting tendency and its motives with the initia- 
tive for the habit. If a parent wanted his son or daughter 
to stand with back straight and chest thrown forward, 
the pride of the child and approval of his parents would 
be the positive initiative. Tendencies to stoop would be 
disapproved equally positively, and fear of becoming like 
some sad example of his acquaintance would serve as 
initiative to the inhibition of the stooping tendency. 
But both of these would act in a way for the inhibitory 
act, just as both would work together in the positive 
function of one and the negative of the other for the 
habit itself. , 
In practical life this is often accomplished by warn- 
ings, “If you allow that for a moment, it will be the end 
- of you,” etc., etc., through a long list. This is helpful 
and even ‘pedagogical, in so far as the caution succeeds 
in associating closely with the tendency to lapse a warn- 
ing vividly calling up the connection of the desired in- 
hibition with the initiative of the desired habit. The 
teacher of manual training will warn a boy who is fitting 
some pieces for a picture frame, “Be careful about those
-P-A-G-E-208
192 HABIT-FORMATION i 
corners; you might just as well throw the whole business 
on the scrap heap in the first place as to make a mistake 
there.” * 
By various strong expressions (and even stress of voice 
seems to count) associations are formed. At. times quite 
artificial associations may be made, as when one prone to 
anger checks himself until he has had time to count thirty. 
Before he has finished, associations connected with his 
initiative for controlling himself are stirred, and probably 
the temptation resisted. 
How beneficial prayer and meditation may be in just this 
particular, is evident. If there were no spiritual advantages 
in prayer and meditation beyond the possibilities they 
offer of keeping present and practical man’s ideals and 
lofty motives, on those grounds alone they would still be 
worthy of rank among life’s most uplifting influences. 
These illustrate very forcibly the possibility of connecting 
motives of inhibition with those for positive action, since 
the roots of positive action in uplifting mankind are no less 
buried in high motives than are those of the more often 
emphasized inhibitions and prohibitions. 
17. Use of concrete reminders.— 3. Supply the child 
with concrete reminders of the original intent. Various in- 
signia, either of honor or of office, — buttons, ribbons, pins, 
etc., — may serve to counteract by their presence tendencies 
otherwise alluring. Similarly proverbs written on the 
blackboard, class mottoes, displays of superior work, rolls 
of honor and other lists, or rewards of the faithful, by their 
presence to the eye, are very likely to be suggestive of good 
impulses at the time of the temptations to lapse, nor 
should the fact that boys wearing Audubon buttons have 
been known to steal birds’ eggs be allowed to act as a very 
discouraging factor in the use of such reminders. 
18. Picturing painful consequences of lapses. 4. Pic-
-P-A-G-E-209
Lo 
———— 
OOo 
r—e— METHODS OF PREVENTING EXCEPTIONS 193 
ture for the child the painful consequences of failure to 
acquire the habit desired. The child is ordinarily unable in 
a cold-blooded fashion to look ahead and see the outcome 
of his action, good or bad. Many a little girl has been 
genuinely surprised at breaking her doll when she had per- 
sisted once too often in throwing it to the ground. The 
person of experience sees how his own character, with its 
merits and demerits, is the outcome of his own choice 
under the conditions in which those choices have been 
made. He can therefore conjecture roughly at least the 
possible outcome of a course of action. The imagination of 
the child is much better fitted for an aimless play of fancy 
than for such definite forecasts, unless aided in them by a 
vivid portrayal on the part of the teacher or parent. 
A little girl of twelve years may not have imagination 
enough to see the pleasure that she will have and give, if 
she persists in daily practice on the piano; but her mother 
may be able to show it to her by calling up an array of 
imaginary occasions when talent would result in great 
satisfaction and many advantages to her. 
Tf to this picture is appended a doleful one representing 
her as lamenting in the future her inability to play, and 
sorrowing at the good times missed on that account, the 
initiative on the side of inhibition as well as on that of 
practice will be greatly strengthened by the contrast. 
The advantages of order, diligence in certain lines, 
punctuality, generosity, politeness, and the like are not 
. always apparent to. the child, and considerable suggestion 
may have to be offered before his imagination could be 
said to develop an initiative of any value. The child has 
become accustomed to an irregular, selfish, and rude 
manner of life, and does not appreciate its disadvantages. 
Tn such instances his imagination must be quickened, and 
perhaps by sad experience itself. For in extreme and in
-P-A-G-E-210
194 HABIT-FORMATION 
exceptional cases it is often in connection with the lapse 
itself that a realization is gained of the advantages of 
this or that habit. For example, a dog of the author’s 
acquaintance fell through the ice of a lake almost at the 
instant of disobedience to a call intended to guard him 
from the danger. He narrowly escaped drowning, and 
apparently out of gratitude for his rescue was converted 
from a most desultory to a most punctilious obedience. 
19. Making painful experiences effective.— 5. Make 
real in case of actual lapses the painful experience, and 
prolongit. If the anticipation of unpleasantness is a deter- 
rent, its realization should prove more deterring. The 
picture of the mother dragging her howling infant all 
bedraggled with mud, by the arm, and saying savagely, 
“Didn’t I tell you not to go near that place?” is certainly 
a familiar one. A highly suitable occasion is pictured for 
developing not only the original initiative to obedience, but 
its subordinate checking or inhibitive tendency. When- 
ever that particular situation comes to view again, the 
emphasis on its unpleasant associations is likely to prove 
effective. 
The device employed by a principal to prolong the pain- 
ful consequence of stealing is an excellent illustration of the 
application of this rule to a hardened case. The child was 
required to report to the principal every day for the rest of 
the year whether she had taken anything that day. Tactful 
treatment and commendation where it was deserved un- 
doubtedly made this severe measure beneficial. 
There are many ways of reminding and intensifying the 
consequences of exceptions made to the habit-forming 
process. The child should feel that it is an evidence of 
weakness on his part, but must not be so humiliated as to 
become discouraged. For the deadening effect of’ his 
discouragement would go far toward counteracting any
-P-A-G-E-211
a 
ee 
a METHODS OF PREVENTING EXCEPTIONS 195 
initiative he might otherwise have. A child who has 
handed in a paper which is far from neat, may perhaps suffer 
both by having to copy it in good shape and perhaps by 
being obliged to add any excuses he may have for his 
previous neglect. But to abuse him and exaggerate the 
offense by calling him generally worthless and shiftless, 
even though other grounds existed, might be to take the 
heart out of him altogether. 
20. Natural and artificial punishment. — All these vari- 
ous ways of making real the painful consequences of ex- 
ceptions reduce themselves to two distinct kinds, natural 
punishments and artificial punishments. The former refer 
to those which follow naturally as consequences of the 
failure, the doctrine of consequences; while the latter, the 
doctrine of punishment, is applied especially to . those 
imposed by some meddler in the environment. We can- 
not overlook the wisdom of nature in the larger aspects of 
her activity, but when it comes to life’s detailed adjust- 
ments, nature isa bungler. She often rewards us for our 
misdeeds, as in the mellowing pleasure which lasts through 
life of some youthful prank. She often punishes us for 
most praiseworthy toil by an ill-timed storm, and for com- 
mendable service by ingratitude or worse. In short, the 
brutality of nature must now be forestalled and now miti- 
gated by more himane measures which may prove equally 
effective for good and less productive of harm; but the 
ineffective measures of nature must be reénforéed by the 
artificial. 
It is agreed that the artificial must never be used except 
in so far as the natural need modification. Nature’s way 
is automatic and reaches deep. Artificial modes are often 
labored and superficial, Both natural and artificial 
punishment may be brutal. The teacher, then, must study 
the consequences of exceptions. If ill-adjusted, his re-
-P-A-G-E-212
196 HABIT-FORMATION 
course must be to his own action. That may mean chastise- 
ment, forfeiture of privilege, or verbal rebuke, ranging from 
the level of scathing condemnation to that of mild scold- 
ing. No general prescription can be laid down for appli- 
cation in preventing exception beyond this, that great 
care should be taken not to get associated with the habit 
any unnecessarily unpleasant feelings, even though they 
are intended to operate inhibitively. If the sphere of appli- 
cation is so widened as to attach them to the desired 
reaction, the resulting dissatisfaction will prevent the repeti- 
tion essential for the formation of the habit. A child whose 
drawings are uniformly condemned in the hope of goading 
him to more careful work will never make an artist. 
21. Promoting self-criticism and self-testing.— In the 
last point to be mentioned for safeguarding against ex- 
ceptions, both the initiative of the inhibition and the 
variation in the situation and the reaction are combined. 
6. Promote self-criticism and self-testing in all habit- 
getting. As an aid in getting visible and concrete facility 
in motor and in many memoriter habits, active self-criticism 
and self-testing are invaluable in forestalling exceptions. 
The “ New England conscience” as applied to habit-forming 
may lead to a poor choice of habits, but it is certain to pro- 
duce results. This type of mind is well represented by the 
woman who in the excitement of the occasion pronounced 
her friend’s new baby beautiful. After reflecting at home 
about it, she decided that she had told a lie and accordingly 
wrote a note apologizing for her untruthfulness. Such 
habits of self-searching certainly tend to produce a habit 
of truth-telling, whatever may be the endowment of com- 
mon sense needed to accompany such extraordinary de- 
velopment of conscience. 
The child who is easily satisfied with the results of his 
labors as well as his way of getting them is in danger of
-P-A-G-E-213
Eee NN A 
| METHODS OF PREVENTING EXCEPTIONS 197 
doing slovenly work. His lessons and his exercises will be 
quite differently done if he tests himself with such ques- 
tions as, “Am I getting the slant right?” —“Can I give 
the names of the first seven Presidents of the United 
States, or mention all the modes of seed distribution, or the 
chief industries of St. Paul and Minneapolis?” The child 
who tests himself on arithmetic combinations, tables, and 
so forth, as he happens to think of them, is not only fixing 
habits valuable in themselves, but is besides forming a 
habit of fixing his habits which is most useful in preventing 
exceptions. 
22. Two cautions. (a) Don’t nag.—Two cautions 
may play a useful part here. 1. Do not nag. It is a great 
waste of initiative. It cancels incentive fast, and creates a 
“don’t care” spirit. It ignores resulting satisfaction, and 
emphasizes the monotony of repetition. As a source of 
initiative and a stimulant to action of the whole-hearted 
sort, its influence rapidly approaches the zero point. It is 
as though instinctive protection had been vouchsafed the 
child against. the ignorance of those who do permit them- 
selves to make a habit of this nagging proclivity. 
23. (6) Don’t expect the child to distinguish automatisms. 
~- 2. Do not expect the child to understand without being 
told that an act is to become habitual, but let him know it 
very definitely. At the same time acquaint him with 
the automatic nature of a habit. The young boy does not 
overlook this point when it is applied to outdoor sports. 
When he tells his associate in baseball to “follow the ball 
to your hands,” he lets him know that that is something he 
must do every time, until it comes so naturally that he 
cannot help it, and that he must watch himself and see if 
he is following the direction. The word “habit” may not be 
1Compare Bagley, “Class-room Management,” p. 166. New 
York, 1907. ‘
-P-A-G-E-214
198 HABIT-FORMATION 
used, but the boy knows what is meant. The same prin- 
ciple applies in the schoolroom, whether or not the word 
“habit” is used. Some principals and teachers make a 
point of showing their classes the value of the right sort of 
habits and how to form them. In the upper grades, some 
instruction regarding habit is highly desirable. 
24. Summary. — Exceptions are not merely negative; 
they are destructive. Their two sources are either weak- 
ened initiative or variations in the situation leading 
to the reaction, or in the reaction itself. These disturbing 
factors should be removed or reduced to the minimum. 
In view of these sources, six general rules have been 
stated : — 
1. Study the habit with a view to all its likely tendencies 
to modifications. 
2. Reénforce by support at the point or time of weakness 
an initiative which is likely to fade. 
3. Remove, if possible, stimuli that menace the habit. 
(Fatigue is a common menace.) 
4. Reduce to the minimum stimuli opposed to the habit. 
5. When the habit has reached its maximum efficiency, 
guard against further variation by special commendation 
of the reaction. 
6. Simplify habits and rid them of special points of 
difficulty by securing smaller contributing habits before the 
more complex are attempted. 
Aside from these maxims growing out of the nature of 
initiative and of variations in the situation or reaction, 
there are certain others which are involved in the child’s 
power directly to inhibit exceptions. This checking 
tendency or inhibition has its own stimuli, and is the ex- 
pression of motives which are fundamental to itself. 
Accordingly, on the side of developing a vigorous inhibitive 
tendency to safeguard against temptations to lapse, the

METHODS OF PREVENTING EXCEPTIONS 199 ~ 
following eight points suggest means of preventing excep- 
tions, the first two being suggested by the nature of the 
stimulus, the next five by the initiative leading to inhibition 
of exceptions, and the last by a combination of both points 
of view: — ; 
1. Make plain the fact that certain variations, either in 
the situation or the reaction, are likely to occur, that they 
are temptations, and must be overcome. 
2. Put the pupil on his guard against the first tendency to 
lapse. : 
3. Prepare for recognition of the danger by leading the 
child to resolve definitely against lapses in general, and 
particularly of the sort anticipated. 
4, Connect by special provision the inhibiting tendency 
and its motives with the motives at the basis of the initia- 
tive for the habit. 
5. Supply the child with concrete reminders of the origi- 
nal intent. 
6. Picture for the child the painful consequences of fail- 
ure to acquire the habit. 
7. Make real in case of actual lapse the painful experience, 
and prolong it. The means is by the natural consequences, 
regulated and adapted, where ill-adjusted, by artificial 
measures. 
8. Promote self-criticism and _ self-testing in habit- 
getting. 
Two cautions conclude this section: 1. Do not nag. 2. 
Do not expect the child, without being told, to understand 
that an act is to become habitual, but let him know it 
very definitely. At the same time acquaint him with the 
value and the automatic nature of habit, perhaps by spe- 
cific instruction on the subject.
-P-A-G-E-216
202 HABIT-FORMATION 
offend our taste, our moral sensibility, or our feeling of 
-what is courteous. They are unfortunate misapplications 
of a tremendous engine for good in human culture. 
3. Problem of both the home and the school. — These 
language habits may be picked up either at home, at 
school, or on the street. It becomes, therefore, incum- 
bent on both parents and teachers to be on their guard 
against undesirable ones, as/the ease with which they 
may be removed is proportional to their newness.) It is 
equally necessary that the teacher and parent codperate 
in the formation of habits. Otherwise there may be a 
lack of common purpose sometimes actually forcing the 
child to make exceptions. Still more important is it in 
breaking a habit that they work together. Any excep- 
tion made reopens the old pathway and delays the con- 
summation desired fay more than it would if a habit 
were being formed. /The breaking of crude and un- 
grammatical habits of expression is almost impossible 
without the backing of the home, and is often unsuccessful 
for the reason that the home is not of a sort to furnish 
such aid. / There are exceptions, but they are relatively 
few, where the initiative of a genius has risen above un- 
favorable surroundings. 
4. Relation between habit-forming and habit-breaking. 
— The question may be raised, If the child’s actions are 
at any given moment the product either of his instinc- 
tive or habitual tendencies, is not every change made, 
as in forming a new habit, a breaking up or splitting 
up of some old one? Surely in one sense it is true that 
the old outfit of customary ways of performing certain 
acts is broken in upon, but the new adjustment required 
may be in response to a new sort of situation, and con- 
sequently there is not and has not been any habit of deal- 
ing with this situation. An adjustment of some sort is
-P-A-G-E-217
TT 
EN “ HOW HABITS ARE BROKEN 203 
made, and will, if repeated often enough, become habitual. 
If the same situation—for example, one involving re- 
proof — has been reacted to for a period perhaps by sulk- 
ing, and later habitually by a cheerful and well-intentioned 
promise to do better next time, evidently an old habit 
has been replaced by a new one. 
On the other hand, is not all habit-breaking habit- 
~forming?’. There are numerous paths or ways of doing 
things. One may be substituted at one time and an- 
other at another. So that whereas one had only one 
habit for a given situation, he now has a large number, 
just as a person in a situation where an affirmation is 
desired, instead of saying “yes,’’ may reply “certainly,” 
1 Professor Horne, in his “ Psychological Principles of Educa- 
tion” (Macmillan, 1907), tries to make the same rules serve for 
both habit-breaking and habit-forming, but is forced to differen- 
tiate. Curtmann refers to habit-breaking (Abgewéhnung) as re- 
versed habit-forming, but makes a general distinction in a passage 
which may be translated as-follows:— 
“The procedure in this afflicted condition of the pupil is dis- 
tinguished from the unfolding of unsullied powers by the fact 
that the child has become older when the treatment is begun, 
that milder measures are no longer effective to the same degree, 
and further that the confidence and the love, which in general 
may be taken for granted in the merely unfolding processes of 
education, can in this sort of process be gained at first in many 
cases only by the exercise of considerable skill -in order to avoid 
any estrangement of the pupil from his teacher. Habits become 
endeared to us, and therefore all habit-breaking is hard. Habit- 
breaking is not a step forward in a chosen direction, but rather a 
backward step, and consequently lacking in the joy of success. 
It presupposes regret. * Unless the child acknowledges his mis- 
take, habit-breaking is doubly difficult.”’} See Curtmann’s “ Lehr- 
buch der Erziehung,” p. 140. Heidelberg, 1846. 
In spite of the relatively much greater complexity of the task 
of breaking a habit, good practice will be afforded the careful 
reader in applying the principles set forth in the previous chapters 
to this one.
-P-A-G-E-218
204. ' HABYT-FORMATION 
“please,” “thank you, yes,” “if you please,” “pray do,” 
“you bet,” “I should like to very much,” “just as you 
say,’”’ or use any other expression that may suggest itself 
as appropriate, each as is evident with a certain fitness 
based on habit for certain occasions and unfitness for 
others, but still taking the place of a simple “yes.” 
Even with this wide choice, however, it might be as true 
to the facts to say that the child really has now twenty 
habits where he formerly had only one. If he makes a 
judicious selection, he has surely broken the habit of 
answering merely with an unresponsive “yes.” 
In other cases the removal of the stimuli or the crowd- 
ing of other impressions so as to absorb all attention, 
causes the habit to disappear or to be “outgrown” with- 
out any definite substitution of another. 
It is evident that some, but not all, habit-forming is 
habit-breaking, and that some, but not all, habit-breaking 
is habit-forming. But the tendency is to supplant a 
habit too simple for the complexities of life with one or 
more better adapted to the manifoldness of experience. 
The natural way to break a habit is therefore to form a 
counter habit. 
5. Nature’s way of breaking habits. — The havoc that 
would be wrought in all progress, were the forces of habitu- 
ation supreme, has been well illustrated by the conserva- 
tism of the Chinese. Rature has equipped man with a con- 
trary impulse to change, to originate, to imagine construc- 
fively, — the forces of “accommodation” as opposed to 
those of “habituation.” ! There is a constant tendency on 
the part of the child to vary his reaction, to experiment, to 
accommodate? or adjust his reaction more delicately if he

Race,” pp. 214-219 and 476-480, Macmillan, 1903.

ener, HOW HABITS ARE BROKEN 205 
can. It often happens that he does vary the action without 
knowing it, and that the variation is a perversion of the 
original purpose and intent. The function of this funda- 
mental tendency is undoubtedly to secure an economy 
of the energy and effort used; and, in case equally good 
results occur, a sort of short circuiting of a part of the 
path takes place with resultant reduction in resistance. 
The reduction in resistance may, however, be at the ex- 
pense of the delicacy of the original adjustment. 
6. Habits formed unconsciously. — All habits that have 
been formed without any consciousness or intent, by un- 
noticed variations are to be distinguished from those 
which are(consciously formed, these last being either so 
intricate, so remote from the more usual ways of reacting, 
or so dependent on effort as to make it quite easy to 
make an exception in their case, whereas (those that 
have crept,into our lives without our knowing it are hard 
to change, because ‘the attention must in some way be 
brought t6 them in the process. Added associations, 
however, make possible a variation both in attention 
and in the reaction. . 
7. The necessity for confidence of success. — Habits 
vary greatly in the difficulty both of making and break- 
ing them. { Those that have woven themselves into the 
warp and woof of our lives without consciousness or effort 
on our part tend to persist. ; Habits which produce a 
morbid craving of the nervous system are hard to break. . 
it with the true perversity of nature, those that cost 
us trouble and effort to form are easily broken. 5 : 
The child-must not be discouraged by failure. When 
an attempt is made to break a habit, err on the side of 
overdoing rather than that of underdoing the effort. ;

intimate trust andiconfidence of the child in his teacher) if 
the teacher is to know all that is necessary to enable the 
child to rally all his forces to the destruction of his enemy. 
8. The situation to be met in habit-breaking. — Given 
a habit that is hard to change, what i is, the situation in 
its various elements? There is, as always, a stimulation 
and a reaction. These two factors may be evident and 
easily recognized, or they may.be, as in all uch habits 
as are not characterized by visible muscular reaction, en- 
tirely mental, and to be judged rather by interpreting 
their results and the person’s own introspection than by 
any definitely visible sign. 
Curtmann ' gives as his chief rule for breaking |

adding that it is even wrong to recall it; rather should 
the thoughts be recalled from it, the associations leading 
to it should be interrupted and broken, even at the -ex- 
pense of progress in other directions. It must be agreed 
with him that. jn_breaking a a_habit with known stimulis 
and known reaction. le, is to inter- 
cept the stimulus. 
9. The removal of stimuli. — If all stimuli of a certain 
sortare.ci it_is evident that the corr i 
actions will will likewise fail to function. As long as a baby 
persists in throwing out of his carriage to the floor what- 
ever is given him to look at, we do not insist on his han- 
dling our valuable bric-a-brac. We remove that sort of 
stimulus. In popular language, he will outgrow the trait.

HOW HABITS ARE BROKEN 207 
The more rarely evil traits have an opportunity of ap- 
pearing, the more the causes are removed by which they 
are excited, the more they will lose in strength, as physi-. 
cal powers relax when exercised.” 
But a child cannot be expected to live all its life with- 
out handling delicate and easily broken objects; sooner 
or later it must learn habits of careful manipulation of 
breakable objects. That is, it is sometimes impossible, 
and_often inadvisable, to remove stimuli; the unsatis- 
factory habits must be modifiéd or adjusted to more 
complex, demands. — In alr all t all habits, if the stimul annot beremeved, 
it, will be found that 1 the reaction_in itself is not-so-bad, 
but, on the other hand, some phases of the act are ill- 
adjusted to..the..complexities of life. The child has 
adapted himself to some situation directly, while man- 
kind has found that different reactions are advisable 
according as various elements in similar situations are 
emphasized. 
to. The interruption of the reaction. — The most radi- 
eal form of modification of a previous habit is its abso- 
lute obliteration. This is effected aside from the removal 
of stimuli only through a long course of neglect, and this 
neglect will only be realized by continued and vigorous 
acts of inhibition for which, as they are to become habitual, 
the devices of method set forth in the previous chap- 
ters are applicable. Where the breaking of the habit 
is not nullification (it is impossible to get up much en- 
thusiasm over mere paralysis), whatever modification is 
made must be of the sort originally described in connec- 
tion with instinct,! either a selection or a combination. 
The movement of the lips while reading is eventually 
stopped, the other habits involved in reading being 
1 See p. 81. 
        
 
-P-A-G-E-222
208 HABIT-FORMATION 
selected, while in playing on the piano the habit of using 
both hands more or less independently is broken by a 
rhythmic combination of the habits involved in move- 
ment of each hand separately. With these also must be 
combined the habits of interpreting the printed symbols. 
zz. Selection and combination. — This selection in- 
volves decided inhibition, as in the former case, where an 
unimportant phase of the total habit is dropped. The 
action may therefore be described from either of its two 
points of view. It is either breaking a habit of moving 
the lips while reading, or forming the habit of reading 
without moving the lips. Whichever name it is given, 
there is distinct inhibition involved in the control of the 
lips, as many can remember in their own experience and 
as the ways of breaking this habit indicate. But in other 
cases, as in breaking a habitual laziness, a number of 
habits are broken and the selection is the essential habit 
of studying one’s physical need of rest or recreation and 
that of keeping at hand enough sorts of useful activity 
to reward effort. The selection in this case is hardly of 
habits to be broken, .e. the selection involved in inhibi- 
tive processes consists really of actions to be made ha- 
“bitual. It is breaking one habit by forming another. 
The breaking of habit by combinations, as in the case of 
the baby’s giving up the habit of indiscriminately throw- 
ing objects to the ground, is almost never pure inhibition. 
If it were, it would mean a waste of opportunity. The 
baby ultimately learns that very few things should be 
so treated; these are to be put in one place, others in 
another; these are to be used in such and such ways, 
and others serve other purposes. In short, a temporary 
habit of pausing is followed by another of specific action. 
1 See Sherrington, “Integrative Action of the Nervous System” 
(Scribner, 1906), for examples of the positive nature of inhibition,
-P-A-G-E-223
  HOW HABITS ARE BROKEN 209 
Whether or no this pause represents predominantly in- 
hibition, as it may, there can be no doubt that it leads 
to deliberative analysis of the situation with the antici- 
pated consequences of certain possible lines of action 
and habitual reactions, according to the results of the 
analysis. The habit of throwing things to the ground 
indiscriminately is broken, and habits of discrimination 
take its place. Again, amore involved habit, or company 
of habits, has taken the place of a former mode of action. 
In more complicated instances the selection and com- 
bination may operate together in breaking a habit. In 
learning to read correctly words involving the French 
“u,” the child must add that sound to others suggested 
by the letter “u.’”” Though he may pronounce the vowel 
correctly by itself, he must be able to use the sound not 
merely in combination with others; but in any combination 
his reading or speech may suggest, this sound is to be 
called up habitually wherever the word is French, and not 
where it is English. He must break up, in other words, 
his habit of pronouncing “‘u” always as in English, and 
add another possibility to be associated with French 
words whether they are interspersed in the English or 
are found in French context. 
12. Bad habits as lines of least resistance. — The 
habitual reaction in question may serve some useful pur- 
pose. It may save time, energy, simplify movements, 
make them more accurate, give them stability, reduce 
fatigue and conscious attention, or minimize feeling, and 
in general it leaves the mind free for more complicated 
functioning. 
A habit serves. as a line of least resistance, and hence, 
as Professor Horne has already pointed out, it is much 
harder to break an old habit than to form a new one, 
since the old association path is there with its tendency
-P-A-G-E-224
210 HABIT~FORMATION 
ready to be set in operation as soon as it is once traversed 
again, or wherever there is hesitation or obstruction of 
the newer habit path. 
13. Substitute habits must have offsetting advantages. 
— If the old habit saves time, and yet is to be broken, 
this saving must be offset by crudities in other respects; 
or it is possible that the gain is more apparent than real. 
Consequently another habit may be equally effective 
as a time-saver, and more desirable otherwise. In a 
similar way, the energy saved, the fatigue reduced, the 
simplification, or the increase in accuracy of movement, 
though useful in themselves, may be at the expense of 
real efficiency, everything considered. The advantages 
may be only apparent, or this habit may take the place 
of some other which could accomplish all the purposes 
of this one, and more. ; If these habits are to be broken, 
the new and substituted habit must have either the real 
advantage of the old or some advantage of greater im- 
portance which the old one did not have. This principle 
is certainly one of the most important for consideration 
in the substitution of habits. Equally important is it 
that the child know and realize as fully as possible the 
advantage of the habit to be substituted. 
14. Inherent difficulties must be overcome. — On the 
other hand, the loss of feeling, the lack of consciousness 
of the reaction, the stability or fixed character, and the 
automatic operation of the habit are distinct obstructions 
to both inhibitions and modifications of the habit. Many 
a man gets a well-nigh incurable stoop in his shoulders 
almost before he is aware of it. He does not feel the 
change, he pays no attention to the reaction, and tends 
rather to add to than to lessen the fault. Given a cer- 
tain train of thought, and the stoop comes of itself. How 
is such a tendency to be resisted? Feeling must be
-P-A-G-E-225
HOW HABITS ARE BROKEN 211 
gained. He must straighten himself up and throw out 
his chest and notice how different he feels. He gets his 
friends to remind him, whenever they see him drooping. 
The attention must be again focused on the carriage of 
the shoulders. Many lines of association must be con- 
nected with the reaction, especially at such times as he 
feels himself likely to yield to the temptation, as perhaps 
on his way ‘home from work. He may think of various 
stores or street corners he is to pass on his way home 
and give them associations with throwing his chest for- 
ward. Whenever he meets a person he knows, or a man 
wearing the sort of hat he does, he is to do the same 
thing. These are all devices for making associations 
which may serve to remind him. Others may be used 
for making him generally conscious of himself. Unless 
he can in some way get the feeling of the reaction or the 
definite consciousness of the reaction, there is almost no 
hope of improvement, since the difficulties raised by the 
stability and automatic character of habit are otherwise 
unassailable. 
Looked at from the broadest point of view, two general 
conclusions, drawn from the discussion so far, are consid- 
erations of the utmost service in habit-breaking. 
15. Attack one bad habit at a time. — If, as has been 
shown, it is hard to focus consciousness on the habit, 
and if the feeling element is practically lost, it is evident 
that consciousness must be taken up as fully as practi- 
cable with the schemes for working against this one habit 
to be broken. Consequently, -in..breaking_a_habit not 
too much should be attempted at once. “One at a time” 
is a5 muchas ean ha-aczainplished, unless they” anb-all

that of using intoxicants, the attack may be made on the 
whole list of stimulating beverages, and should extend to
-P-A-G-E-226
214 HABIT-FORMATION ” 
19. Emphasis on preventing exceptions. — The chap- | 
ters on getting initiative and practice are equally perti- | 
nent here in every phase, including especially the earnest | 
conviction of the child that it will be well worth while, 
but the chapter on methods of preventing exceptions is 
much more vital when a habit is to be broken, since it 
will take no more than one or two lapses to reéstablish 
even in more than its original strength the undesirable 
habit. The discouragement of failure alone is deadly to 
the initiative. Besides, resources have been drawn upon 
and used up so that new motives must be sought and 
added to the old, if they can be patched up into service- 
able condition at all. 
In so far as new habits are substituted for old ones, 
the breaking of habit is only a phase of creating a new 
one, —a phase in which the opposing stimuli and the 
reaction are known to exist, consequently emphasizing 
the importance of preventing exceptions. 
20, Relation of breaking habits to the methodology of 
forming them. — It is almost impossible in the great mul- 
tiplicity of habits to be broken to fix any of the points 
of emphasis except in the most general way. It is evi- 
dent, however, that aside from the guarding against ex- 
ceptions, the development either of habits of inhibition 
or positive opposing habits must be built on a counter 
initiative. Certain phases of that will need especial at- 
tention. A phase, too, of the reaction, the slight variation 
which in forming a habit is important only as a tendency 
to be guarded against, is here emphasized, because it 
lends material aid in shifting or substituting reactions. 
This will be touched upon briefly in connection with 
practice which, in the case of breaking habits, is given 
a quite different weight. For, although practice ordi- 
narily implies stimuli promoting repetition, it is hardly
-P-A-G-E-227
. 
a HOW HABITS ARE BROKEN 215 
sensible to multiply undesirable stimuli just for the sake 
of securing practice in inhibiting. Even a habit should 
not be. practiced without great care as to the conditions, if 
its desirability is chiefly as a substitute. Aside from this 
difference in the practice, then, first the use of the counter 
initiative, and second the use of variations, chiefly distin- 
guish habit-breaking from habit-forming. 
21. Initiative for breaking habits. Positive initiative. 
— Only one new suggestion need be made here for get- 
ting substitute habits. As before, deyel ositive initia- 
tive, but ve not forget to add well the initi 
  The. posi= 
‘tive sourc sources eof initiative “will be, as in all ca “cases, the ) emo- 
tions, the interests, . the ‘instincts, resulting or _antielpated 
satisfactions,"and the more involved specific motives. 
They can be counted upon to function, and must be called 
upon vigorously. 
22. Special incentives to inhibition. Negative initia- 
tive. — In-getjing inhibition, the source of initiative may be any of the preceding, but those. which n nature seems to 
have intrusted with the strongest immediate checking 
tendency,-even_ta. the point of, deadening ac action, are the 
avoidance. of.pain, avoidance of danger, fear, and result- 
ing or ated dissatisfaction. Some,.if not-most_of 
these, maybe made. use_of or amalgamated with more 
positive initiative,.not-only in - their... special. function, 
developing inhibition itself, but also in « developing a new 
habit. The hesitation gives opportunity for deliberation, 
and the analysis of the situation is sure to suggest the 
habit desired and the initiative with which it is linked. 
Thus, if a child was accustomed to picking his teeth with 
apin, to break the habit, one might inhibit the action 
by showing him the danger of injuring his teeth, the pain 
and trouble that he would bring upon himself. His action 
   
-P-A-G-E-228
216 HABIT-FORMATION 
might be checked, but the unpleasant stimuli wedged 
between his teeth are calling for action. If another 
habit, i.e. a modification of this one, such as substituting 
a wooden toothpick for the pin, is not suggested, there 
will almost certainly be exceptions made on account of the 
continuous stimulation. This new plan may be imitated, 
commended, or otherwise given an associated satisfac- 
tion which will more strongly energize it than could the 
more remote impulse to inhibit without such reénforce- 
ment.! ag 
There are situations wh habitual act mz

‘ofa sort to exclude habits of centering attention on other 
stimuli than t those pr provocative of the undesired reaction, 
and the purposed “shift of attention ‘becomes in itself a 
: substituted habit. : 
23. The double use of initiative. — Although the same 
sources of initiative as in habit-forming may serve in 
inhibition, there is evidently a shifting of emphasis. 
The instincts of imitation, play, construction, ownership, 
and love of the beautiful, for example, could never mean 
much in the purely inhibitive aspect of breaking a habit, 
however useful they may be in forming one. When a 
child stops saying “ain’t it,” he has nothing to imitate 
as a substitute, unless we suggest the habit of saying 
‘isn’t it.’ Play and construction are not very useful when 
really something is not to be done. On the other hand, 
pride and love of approval may be useful; so sympathy, 
love of the right, may combine powerfully with the main- 
stays of inhibition, avoidance of pain and danger, fear, 
shyness, and resulting or anticipated dissatisfaction. Even 
emulation or pugnacity may be turned to account by a 
1 See pages 145 and 146. 2 See Section 11 of this chapter.    
     
    
 
-P-A-G-E-229
Sn _ 
Dc HOW HABITS ARE BROKEN 217 
personification of the habit, in which the child is en- 
couraged not to let it get the best of him. 
Similarly, among the emotions the positive should be 
reénforced by those opposite emotions which will be 
called into action with any exception to the habit. To 
the feeling of self-approval at success in the direction of 
the new habit should be added the anticipated disappoint- 
ment at failure in breaking the old. Indeed, this feeling 
should theoretically be so strong as to make it impossible 
really to conceive the failure as a possibility. 
In the case of interest, it is hardly to be expected that 
a child will have a strong interest in the discontinuance 
of an act.” It will at best be a borrowed interest. Some 
line of action in which he is interested will be furthered 
by abstaining from this one. If a substituted habit may 
be connected with direct interest, then the borrowed 
‘interest will easily serve in inhibiting the habit to be 
broken. A child may have the habit of asking uncere- 
moniously for favors. If they are not granted on such 
occasions, the interest (7.e. the pleasurable activity, de- 
sign, or plan), which they would have served, suffers. On 
the other hand, if in addition when he says “ please,”’ his 
plans are furthered, the interest in the habit of saying _ 
“please”? is more nearly direct and combines with the 
indirect or borrowed interest for abandoning the impolite 
form of demand. 
The same illustration shows the difference in the ap- 
plication of the resulting or anticipated satisfaction or 
dissatisfaction. Dissatisfaction in connection with any 
action must be the real initiative for inhibition. When 
we try an experiment and get unsatisfactory results, we 
do not often try that same reaction again. Dissatisfac- 
tion is not a very inspiring sort of incentive. If, how- 
ever, in addition to the unpleasantness which has been 
associated with the habit to be broken, distinct satis-
-P-A-G-E-230
218 HABIT-FORMATION 
faction has been associated with a counter substituted 
habit, the breaking of the old habit is assured. 
The depressing effect of motives tinged with self-indul- 
gence, love of ease, low standards, or pessimism, although 
they are available to a limited degree in forming habits, 
renders them practically useless as a basis for the effort 
necessary for the breaking of habit. On the other hand 
the inspiration of noble example, of lofty ideals, worthy 
principles, and high standards not only lends powerful 
support to inhibiting undesirable impulses, but directly 
serves and promotes the readiness to put forth effort which 
is indispensable both to breaking the old and forming 
a new habit. 
24. Will power as initiative. — Many a strong-willed 
person has wondered why the author has not long ere 
this used the following receipt for breaking a habit, — 
“Just make up your mind that you will do whatever 
you start out to do.” The answer is simply that it is 
included naturally among the motives, and is therefore 
brought in under them here. Moreover, it is one of the 
most powerful motives to him for whom it is a motive 
at all; but, on the other hand, those who have the most 
habits to break are often just those to whom such mo- 
tives are strangers. In children there is often an almost 
instinctive persistence which some parents and teachers 
seek foolishly to overcome, describing their action as 
“breaking the child’s will,’””— words which fly danger- 
signals even in themselves. To break a child’s will in 
the sense of crossing him unreasonably and needlessly is 
to rob him of one of the most powerful factors not only 
in habit-forming and habit-breaking, but also for success in 
life. If a child’s purpose is wrong and must be thwarted, 
if he either cannot comprehend the reasoning against 
it, or there is no time for explanations in the crisis of the

anaes HOW HABITS ARE BROKEN 219 
moment, the child may be overruled for his own good 
or even the good of others; but his will, his optimistic 
persistence in expenditure of effort and in overcoming of 
obstacles, should never be held up as a direct object of 
attack, as though it were tainted in itself and needed 
surgical treatment. 
25. The association of initiative with the stimuli. — 
Does the fact that in habit-breaking the stimuli and the 
reaction are both given in potentia make any difference 
in the application of the initiative? Unquestionably it 
does. The initiative in habit-forming must often even 
furnish the stimuli aswell as the reaction itself. Here, 
then, is one point of advantage in habit-breaking. To 
the given stimulus by direct and indirect paths of asso- 
ciation may be attached initiative of many sorts. If 
upon this stimulus are centered dozens of suggestions for 
inhibition, and one well-developed channel for release of 
the neural activity, the habit can scarcely persist. A 
child who wiped her hands on her dress should be made 
to think of the way it looked when it was spoiled, of the - 
grieved looks and reproving words she received, of the 
party or picnic she couldn’t go to because her dress was 
spoiled, and so forth. But all these must be called up 
not so much by the dress as by the wet and sticky hands, 
so that all these memories with their sorrows may be 
suggested by those hands acting, when wet or sticky, as 
stimuli, If, then, it is made easy for her to go and get 
them washed and this act is provided with its satisfac- 
tions, the habit has better chance of persisting. 
26. The association of initiative with the reaction. — 
On the side of the reaction, however, there is a corre- 
sponding disadvantage. A certain satisfaction must be 
attached to the reaction, even though a bad one, or it 
would never have become habitual. New associations
-P-A-G-E-232
220 HABIT-FORMATION 
must be attached to the reaction, then, of such a sort as 
to counteract that satisfaction and turn it, if possible, 
into a dissatisfaction. Bad habits of posture are, when 
formed, at least seemingly more comfortable than the 
more desirable ones. The various disadvantages and 
discomforts of the bad postures must, therefore, be brought 
to the child’s consciousness; the discomforts of a good 
position (if the child is annoyed by them and only on 
this condition), though minimized as only temporary, 
must be relieved in whatever ways may be discovered; 
and the founts of initiative, of imitation, pride, love of 
approbation, ownership, et cetera, should be turned to 
fullest account for the new habit. 
27. Initiative and inhibition as related to the reaction. 
— It is in connection with the reaction, especially, that the 
double use of initiative applies. Aside from this counter- 
acting of initiative already associated with the reaction 
to be overcome, which has just been pointed out, the 
various sources of initiative may be called upon both for 
inhibition of the opposed reaction, or in furtherance of 
the opposing habit much as in any situation involving 
habit-forming merely. Dissatisfaction may counteract 
incentive to the habitual act, while associated satisfaction 
of one sort or another may further that which is to take 
the place of the habit to be broken. / 
28. Practice and habit-breaking. — It may not be evi- 
dent how practice may be applied to the new cessation 
of an habitual action. Supposing that the stimuli, both 
physical and mental, are cut off; it is evident that there 
will be no practice or need of it. Unfortunately, how- 
ever, it is often, as has been already shown; either impos- 
sible or undesirable to remove the stimuli; consequently, 
there will be opportunity for practice either in inhibiting 
1 See Chap. VIII.
-P-A-G-E-233
a NE. ee 
gee 
cen 
ey HOW HABITS ARE BROKEN 221 
the old or in the development of a new habit. But, 
whereas in habit-forming opportunities should be sought 
for practicing, on the contrary in breaking a habit not 
only should the stimuli be obstructed, but, as far as pos- 
sible, every suggestion of the habit should be removed. 
This is a fundamental difference which admits of no 
exceptions, unless the substitute habit is worthy of forma- 
tion for itself alone, and is reasonably certain of successful 
consummation. 
29. The obstruction and counteracting of stimuli. — To 
accomplish the obstruction of the stimuli and all sources of 
suggestion, it is evident that the child’s mind must be 
thoroughly occupied with other interests. This is particu- 
larly true of such times and places as might in themselves 
suggest the habits, were the mind free to concern itself 
with those suggestions. Indeed, it is often desirable to 
change completely the environment. This is the only sen- 
sible reason for placing a too communicative or playful boy 
in the midst of girls whose attention will not be distracted 
by him, though usually this change of seat is made only as a 
punishment and the boy does not stay there long enough to 
assist him in really getting his mind down to his work 
habitually. The emphasis must be here, as in almost 
all cases of habit-breaking, on the attempt to counteract 
the stimuli provoking the habit to be broken, and on™ 
making the practice in resisting the allurements of these 
stimuli actual in every case where the stimuli succeed in 
attracting attention. No opportunities for practice of the 
inhibiting habit should be sought. It is unwise for children 
to play with fire for the sake of practice in keeping out of 
harm’s way. 
30. Importance of variations.— The second funda- 
mental difference between breaking and developing habits 
is, as we have seen in the use of the variations, accommoda-
-P-A-G-E-234
222 HABIT-FORMATION 
tions, slight adjustments, and so forth, which represent the 
force opposed to habituation as a development factor. 
In habit-forming they were important up to the point where 
the habit was perfected. From that point they became 
a menace to the adjustment, and one of the principles - 
advocated was calling especial attention to perfected re- 
actions so that they might be repeated exactly at their 
best. In connection with breaking habits, these variations 
are to be seized upon. They are not only to be encouraged, 
but actively suggested in every feasible way. | 
31. Variations related to the stimulation. — Variations 
may concern the stimulation or the reaction itself. Those 
that concern the stimulation are relative either to the initia- 
tive or to the source of the stimulation. They may be 
greatly altered as far as the initiative is concerned by linking 
with it inhibitory incentives and by presenting broader, but 
reasonable and clear, points of view. More important, how- 
ever, is the suggestion offered that the teacher must 
study the habit, acquaint himself with the stimuli not only 
at this moment, but all the possible stimuli including those 
which originally caused the habit and those that are now 
sufficient to induce the reaction. 
These stimuli discovered, they may be so linked with asso- 
ciations and suggestions as to cause a new habit that will 
replace the old, just as a child may have such associations 
centered about the sex function that instead of a habit of 
thinking crudely and irreverently in that connection, he may 
think both reverently and even scientifically, as soon as his 
knowledge of biology is sufficiently extended. 
\ It is easy for a boy or girl to fall into habits of being 
lazy, shiftless, unsystematic, or silly. / Many a child has 
kept a careless habit of this sort long enough to rob him 
of all possibility of attaining what would have been easily 
within his grasp, if only in the situations characterized by
-P-A-G-E-235
a HOW HABITS ARE BROKEN 223 
such reactions the abundant and compelling associations 
which are within easy reach had been brought to focus. 
32. Variations in the reaction.— Although the provoca- 
tives themselves of the habit must be surrounded with 
initiative, and this in itself constitutes a variation, it 
is particularly of the variations in the reaction itself and 
the associations which go with it that help is gained. 
The difficulty presented by the lack of feeling and of con- 
scious attention has already been described. Here is the 
only opportunity for overcoming that difficulty. Varia- 
tions must be made in the reaction. This evidently ap- 
plies to habits so established, that they will persist in spite 
of a strong opposing initiative simply because there is no 
consciousness of the act as taking place. 
Such a habit is illustrated by the case of a boy who 
injured his hip so badly that for a long time it hurt him to 
walk and caused him to develop a habit of limping, which 
persisted long after all soreness had disappeared. But how 
could he be taught to walk without limping when he knew 
neither that he was limping nor what he did with one leg 
that was different from what he did with the other? He 
must be made conscious of the difference by walking before 
a mirror or by being imitated. He must practice the part 
of the swing or recovery from the swing with that leg until 
he gets a more direct movement. He must get the feeling 
of the correct gait as compared with the feeling of his 
faulty one. The muscles which play a part in the false 
movement may be indicated, or the time of its beginning may 
be told or shown him. In other words, every encourage- 
ment is given him to vary the reaction by rousing the 
feeling, directing his attention again to the detail of his 
movement, and suggesting variations, the whole reaction 
being surrounded with associations tending to produce one 
or all of these three results.
-P-A-G-E-236
224 HABIT-FORMATION 
33. Natural versus artificial variations.—-The sources 
of variation "may be natural, and such are to be promoted; 
but it may be impossible to discover them or dangerous 
to wait. In such cases recourse must be had, as in genéral, 
to the artificial variations it is possible to induce. These 
are of three kinds — addition to the reaction, omission of 
elements, or complication. Language habits will illustrate 
most briefly each of these. The omission of ‘‘e” in pro- 
nouncing eleven “leven” must be righted by addition of the 
first syllable to the habit; the pronunciation of the word, 
“often” with the “t” sounded, must be amended by omis- 
sion of the “t”’; and many who pronounce the last syllable 
of literature “toor,” should substitute for this a pronuncia- 
tion by analogy with picture and fixture, thus both subtract- 
ing and adding to the previous reaction for that word. 
All of these are the simplest cases of what may be ex- 
tremely intricate processes. Nor do I believe that the 
more intricate applications are any less practicable than 
the simpler ones. All depends on the clearness with which 
the teacher or parent sees the need. 
34. Dangers of injurious variations. —-Whatever modifi- 
cation or variation is made in the reaction should not be 
selected at random. It is possible that the variation 
made may be worse than the habit. A child may have 
formed an undesirable but relatively harmless habit. If 
he is taken to task too severely, he may be driven to a 
habit of secretiveness or concealment much less desirable 
than the original habit. 
35. Preventing lapses into the old habit. — It is well- 
nigh impossible to select points for emphasis from the 
chapter on preventing exceptions as applied to breaking 
habits, except as has already been done in connection with 
the removal and reduction of stimuli and the use of varia- 
tions. Otherwise, the whole chapter applies. It need
-P-A-G-E-237
  ee 
a 
pe, 
RS 
A 
ae 
gp HOW HABITS ARE BROKEN 225 
only be borne in mind that the stimuli to be removed or 
reduced are those of the undesirable habit itself, while un- 
desirable habits are both to be varied and complicated. 
Whereas the inhibitive tendency in preventing exceptions 
in forming habits is to avoid lapses from the habit, in think- 
ing of it from the standpoint of this chapter it is to avoid 
lapses into the habit. With these precautions in mind, its 
application is reasonably plain. 
In one respect there is less danger here in the use of 
punishment. If the old habit is made responsible for 
trouble, it will be all the more in disfavor, and conse- 
quently more likely to be overcome. There is with fit 
precaution no such danger that unpleasant associations 
may attach to the new substitute habit, as there is when 
habits are to be formed rather than broken. The only 
dangers are here, as in all punishments, those of discourage- 
ment and of loss in frank and open good feeling. 
36. Need of nice judgment and study of individual cases. — 
In spite of the length to which this discussion of the points 
of emphasis in the preceding chapters as applied to the 
overcoming of habits has of necessity been continued, the 
writer feels that the complication of the problem must 
baffle any attempt to meet it in advance. Consequently, 
much nice judgment on the part of the teacher or parent 
is necessary in any individual case. All the intricate pos- 
sibilities have not been, and could not be, considered, and 
only main lines of consideration have been attempted. 
37. Application to a concrete case. For the rest no 
better expedient can well be adopted than to take the 
various points in the chapter and apply them to a concrete 
case in a way that may seem formal to some, but has been 
chosen chiefly for the reason that it enables the reader to 
discover without effort the applicability of the series of 
points or principles established.
-P-A-G-E-238
226 HABIT-FORMATION 
38. (a) Thestudy and demonstration of a concrete habit. 
— To take, for example, a boy’s habit of shuffling his feet as 
he walks, it may seem easily remedied to one who has not 
dealt with groups of children. It is, however, one of those 
habits gained unconsciously, and is often exceedingly difficult 
to break. In the teacher's preliminary consideration (follow- 
ing rather closely the suggestions of Chapter VII), it is easy 
to see that a new habit is to be taught, since any modifica- 
tion of a customary mode of walking must be automatic, 
be serial, and bear in its complete form all the marks needed 
for identification. A counter habit is to be substituted and 
all effort concentrated in that direction. The shuffling 
gait is to be replaced by one which is straightforward, brisk, 
and businesslike. This cannot be taught in one lesson. 
It implies a series of lessons in forming a habit. Ideas 
are involved only as they contribute to the formation of this 
substitute habit. 
In this instance application of the principle that the 
teacher must study the habit in detail, and try it himself, 
leads to that which is too self-evident to serve as illustra- 
tion. The teacher knows what good carriage involves, and 
can readily discover the boy’s main faults. Attention may 
then be directed to them whether they concern the head, 
shoulders, body, and legs and feet. 
1. In giving the child an idea of the way in which he is 
to walk, the first essential is an actual concrete demonstra- 
tion by the teacher of the special points to which attention 
should be called. Besides this, the boy may be on the 
lookout for examples of manly bearing, which please him, 
and for illustrations of what he has been shown by the 
teacher. If necessary, some of the other children may help 
by marching and so furnish a basis for pointing out essen- 
tials, though care must be taken that such help is given 
tactfully and sympathetically.
-P-A-G-E-239
  HOW HABITS ARE BROKEN 227 
2. Ask him to describe the marching of soldiers, or the 
bearing of persons of good carriage. 
3. Let him practice the stepping forward, making sure 
that he keeps his leg straight at the knee until it is time 
to bend it at the beginning of the next step. 
4, Have him demonstrate his understanding of what is 
meant. He may hold his stomach too far forward or 
incline from side to side with a slight rolling motion. The 
task must consist of demonstration on the teacher’s part 
and experimentation on the part of the child under the 
kindly criticism of the teacher, with liberal praise for success, 
even before much success is won. 
The sort of variation included here must consist of both 
additions and subtractions. The bend of the knee must be 
delayed ; the back must be straightened; the throwing for- 
ward of the stomach must be omitted. The needed varia- 
tions would be a long time developing naturally, or auto- 
matically, and consequently must be made as a result of the 
teacher’s or parent’s foresight and planning. 
39. (0) The calling up of the initiative. — Before this 
undoubtedly the initiative (as suggested by Chapter VIII) 
should have been called into action. Initiative is con- 
sidered separately here, so that each chapter may have its 
own distinct contribution to this specific problem. Of 
the list mentioned, though almost any of them could in 
some phase be made to serve, the following suggest them- 
selves to the writer as most applicable: imitation, play, 
love, sympathy, sociability, the expressive instinct, ambi- 
tion, emulation, rivalry, pride, independence, courage, and 
pugnacity. All of these in different ways challenge his 
stamina, his ability to conquer. They are all positive, 
favoring the new habit. To them should be added the 
inhibiting initiatives, such as his disgust at himself for falling 
into such a habit, dislike for the slouchy acts of slouchy
-P-A-G-E-240
228 HABIT-FORMATION 
people, the pitying remarks of the sympathetic, the ridicule 
of the unsympathetic, the losses that may come to him, 
and so forth.” 
Most of the above are so nearly akin to egoistic and social 
emotion that little additional help may be gained from 
those forms of feeling, but intellectual emotion may be ap- 
pealed to if the child can discover for himself any helps in 
correcting his fault or further instances of good carriage. 
The idea of grace and harmonious adaptation of effort to 
accomplishment may be suggested by the esthetic emotion, 
while even the moral emotion raises the question whether 
it is right for him to announce himself by his way of walk- 
ing as a careless, slovenly boy. And, on the reverse side, 
his dislike of appearing awkward and clumsy or of being 
disapproved, may help. 
His interest in individuals will lead him to many com- 
parisons, and if he can see well-drilled soldiers, his interest 
may be extended to groups and lead at his teacher’s quiet 
suggestion to his joining a “ boys’ brigade” or organizing a 
small company among the boys of the neighborhood. 
Nowhere to a greater degree than in a habit of this sort 
will the success gained be dependent on the resulting 
satisfaction which comes through the teacher’s recognition 
and commendation of his effort and of his successes. Vari- 
ous means of heightening this satisfaction may be tried, and 
should lead all the way from a quiet glance of approval to a 
public recognition of merit; but ammunition of this sort, 
as of any other, must not be used up at the beginning of the 
contest. It is valuable for the very reason that it keeps 
carrying forward initiative. On the other hand, the 
teacher’s disapproval, withdrawal of privilege, and his un- 
feigned sorrow at the boy’s failure are also valuable as 
incentives to inhibition. 
Other motives which may serve are: manliness; his
-P-A-G-E-241
HOW HABITS ARE BROKEN 229 
; thought of how some favorite friend, how some honored 
| character he has read about, would carry himself; or per- 
| haps a general feeling that it pays to do what his teacher 
and parents favor, whether he sees any real sense in it him- 
, self or not. If rewards of some special sort such as the 
monitorship “of the goldfish bowl,” special privileges, and 
[ the like, act as powerful motives, they may also be useful 
as exceptional or extraordinary modes of appeal. The 
danger is that the child comes to feel in such cases that he 
  _ is doing a favor to his teacher in getting this habit. What- 
ever motive is used, it must enlist his effort and persistence. 
Here is where he is to show his will power. Let him see 
that all depends on him. 
Lastly, to illustrate the necessity of connecting motives 
and habits, it may be that he is very anxious to gain the 
favor of some special group of boys or girls, or that he is soon 
to go to work and wants to make a good impression on his 
employer. He may never have discovered or thought that 
his shuffling, slovenly gait would rule him out of favor in 
‘either of these directions. 
( 40. (c) The practice of the good carriage. — Evidently, 
| practice of the good carriage is desirable, and the following 
points apply: — 
' 1. A specified time for special practice under the 
| eyes of the teacher might be afforded by a marching drill. 
2. For practice, a certain distance so often a day may 
be designated. Perhaps going and coming from school 
would be a favorable time. The stimuli which come to 
him from all sides as he walks may be variously associ- 
ated with the new habit by frequent and diverse means of 
suggestion. 
3. Whenever he sees a person standing or walking par- 
| ticularly erect, he must think that now is the time for 
    him to make a special effort, and any person having a 
yy
-P-A-G-E-242
230 HABIT-FORMATION 
slovenly gait may also serve by contrast to call to mind his 
_ need of practice. 
4. Certain corners or certain scenes which he must pass 
on his way to school may be made to act as reminders. - 
Or let him think of boys he is very likely to meet, and decide 
to straighten up and do his best when he sees them. These 
associations will help to promote practice. 
5. Put him in positions of responsibility in the school 
line and elsewhere, so that variations in favor of more 
briskness of gait and erectness of posture may be suggested. 
6. Don’t put all of the effort at first on breaking the 
habit and then forget all about it. In the memorandum 
of things attempted, make a note of the child’s intention and 
with or without reference to it keep the child practicing 
from time to time, even after he has made a good beginning. 
To make the practice effective, not formal, — 
1. Remind him in various ways of the initiative that 
seemed to appeal to him most. 
2. Let him know that he has not succeeded, until he 
usually walks as he can when trying his best. 
3. Let him see that mere desire to get the good habit 
will not suffice. Only through effort will he gain success. 
4. The variations of the reaction suggested by study 
of the habit must direct attention to many special points 
in the reaction and very likely to traces of satisfaction 
which may have associated themselves with his various 
efforts to improve. 
Almost any method must provide for practice, but for 
the greatest possibility of practice the codperation of the 
parents is desirable. 
41. (d) Preventing lapses into the shuffling gait. — 
From the standpoint of the initiative needed, the lurking 
pitfalls, and the opposing stimuli, the following points 
are the applications suggested : — i
-P-A-G-E-243
  HOW HABITS ARE BROKEN _ 231 
1. The tendency to revert to the old habit is constant. 
It may show itself at any of the points at which the prelimi- 
nary study of the habit revealed weakness. 
2. When the child is tired or piqued or disturbed, the 
teacher may need quietly to reénforce his waning initiative. 
3 and 4. The rules for removal and reduction of stimuli 
opposed to the counter habit hardly apply, because those 
provocative of the habit to be broken cannot be removed, 
and can in only some slight degree be reduced. However, 
the various associations centering on these may be made 
to aid the new habit greatly, if they suggest sufficient 
sorts of variation to insure the desired reaction. 
5. After sufficient variation has been produced to start 
the new habit, all tendencies toward the old habit must be 
guarded against by special warnings. In this case it is 
difficult to rid the new habit of special points of difficulty 
in advance. The whole habit of walking forms a unit, and 
only in exceptional cases could there be some e preliminary 
practice which would be helpful. 
More can be accomplished on the side of developing in- 
hibitive tendency. 
1, Let the boy understand that any inclination arising 
later to slip into the old way of walking is a temptation, and 
must be met with determination and persistence on his 
part. 
2. If, when tired, he begins to show the tendency to 
lapse, warn him. So on any occasion when conditions vary, 
put him on his guard without waiting until he has already 
dropped back into his former gait. 
8. Lead him to resolve with conviction not to yield to 
fatigue, or any other tempting influence to fall back even 
for the moment into his old habit. 
4. If, for example, his ambition is the strongest motive 
for the new habit, show him how unfitting it would be for a
-P-A-G-E-244
232 HABIT-FORMATION 
boy of his spirit and ambition to slump into the old way 
of walking. 
5. A button with the picture of a soldier on it, a keep- 
sake, or a badge may serve as a concrete reminder. 
6. Show him how he would suffer if he were condemned 
always to walk that way; what he would miss in the way 
of approval, dignity, and respect. Let him compare him- 
self in that event with some undesirable character selected 
from life or literature. 
7. In case of his really falling back, make an ado over it 
in a sensible, but still for him very embarrassing, way. From 
time to time a reminder not too unsympathetically given 
may be useful. 
8. Get him to watch himself, to ask himself definite 
questions which will give him a basis for self-criticism. 
These points will suffice to show that the rules for forming 
a habit are applicable in much of their original form to the 
problem of breaking one. Of the rules which cover scien- 
tifically the problem of breaking a habit, almost all have been 
found to be available and suggestive in this illustrative case. 
Further illustrations of the application of these rules of’ 
habit-forming will be found in the next chapter. 
42. Summary. — The important thing in teaching is to 
form good habits. Incidentally, those bad habits which 
have crept into the child’s life unbidden are to be removed. 
They represent bad adjustments. Teachers and parents 
should cooperate in their removal.

preventing lapses in forming habits are equally appli- 
cable in breaking them. 
Nice judgment is necessary as well as a study of each 
individual case. The concrete illustration, breaking the 
habit of walking witha shuffling gait, serves to indicate 
/the applicability of the directions for studying the habit, 
/ getting initiative, practicing the inhibition or substituted 
habit, and for preventing lapses.

Morat TRAINING ' 
“Habit isa cable. Every day we weave a thread until it is so 
strong we cannot break it.” ~— Horace Mann. 
1. The meaning of discipline. — To discipline a person 
wisely is so to manipulate his environment as to develop 
in him, without waste of time or effort, valuable habits. 
No necessary connection either with fear or punishment is 
implied; for these, as we have seen, are the least effective 
motives for forming vigorous habits. Popularly, the word 
“discipline” is used loosely to indicate punishment for in- 
fractions of rules, training in habits desirable for the eco- 
nomical management of a school, and for the formatian of 
character, or the sharpening of the wits for intellectual 
operations. This ambiguity necessitates the limitation of 
the term by such words as “ school,” or “ moral training,” if 
one is to exclude the habits involved in’ the acquisition of 
specific sorts of knowledge rather than those of conduct. 
Training is a word also used loosely and signifying the 
sum-total of preparation for action of a certain sort. As 
such it includes the development of both ideas and habits, 
while discipline evidently applies only to an ability to 
conduct one’s self thus and so, without regard to whether the 
Understanding is active or not. “Theirs not to reason why. 
Theirs but to do and die” is the attitude of discipline. 
2. Enumeration of important school habits.—Of the 
habits of first importance because of their assistance in 
conducting a school economically, and included in those 
235
-P-A-G-E-248
oe 236 HABIT-FORMATION 
which it is necessary for a teacher to secure in his pupils, 
if he is to be called a disciplinarian, are the following: order, 
obedience, respect, reliability, independence, diligence, 
accuracy, quickness, carefulness, punctuality, kindness, 
courtesy, neatness, and erect posture. 
Besides these, adding for the sake of completeness those 
most worthy of emphasis, but contributing rather to 
scholarship, are: habits of attention, sense discrimination, 
observation, interpretation, invention, logical memory, 
comparison, classification, inference, and accurate formula- 
tion. The habit of study (or better the habits of study) 
might be added to these, but it is really made up of many 
different types of habit — now observation plus inference 
and accurate formulation (as in nature study or biology), 
now interpretation plus memory (as in history), inference 
and formulation (as in mathematics), now observation plus 
invention (as in physics and mechanics), and the like. 
Habits of organization would differ similarly in the combina- 
tions of habits peculiar to one field of thought as compared 
with another. 
On the side of moral training, the great. and important 
habits by general consent are: positively service,negatively 
self-control. But each of these implies habits of attention, 
plus habits of inhibition, plus habits of decision. by reference 
to ideals, i.e. on the basis of the best knowledge available, 
plus finally the habit of putting the decision into im- 
mediate execution. 
These are all volitional, and with them should be classed 
habits of putting forth physical and mental effort, habits 
of making an accurate language record of his thought, 
and habits of expression, this including habits of expres- 
sion by word, written or spoken, by gesture, pantomime, 
dramatic representation, drawing, painting, sculpture, and 
other forms of manual representation.
-P-A-G-E-249
DISCIPLINE AND MORAL TRAINING 237 
3- The complexity of school habits. — It is evident that 
each of these habits is in itself a grouping or class including 
large numbers of specific habits. For example, the habit 
of obedience may be called into play by two teachers and 
not by the third or by the home. Accuracy in arithmetic, 
spelling, history, may exist in one subject and not in others, 
or sometimes even in a section of a subject and not in other 
parts. Punctuality may be found in connection with busi- 
ness and not in social engagements, or vice versa. 
Most of these habits disclose as well the involved nature 
exhibited by the habit of self-control. 
Order, for example, is dependent first of all on having one 
definite place for each separate object to be kept in order. 
The habit of thinking of their place whenever things are 
found out of it and not in use, is a second essential as a © 
foundation for order. People seem to recognize the out- 
of-placeness of objects, and this fact underlies the humor of 
many a joke. So Mr. Dooley’s allusion to the buttons in 
the soup or rope in the potted ham was sure of a hearing, 
though the workshop of many a cultivated man and the 
workbasket of many an educated woman are scenes of dis- 
order such as would never be tolerated in a packing house. 
To this habit of establishing a place for everything of use, 
and that of recognizing the out-of-placeness of things, 
should be added the habit of returning to its definite place 
whatever is not in use.! 
In the case of the first habit, any unfamiliar or new 
possession or situation must furnish the stimulus for the 
equivalent of a series of reactions like the following: 
“new thing,” “where shall I keep it?”, “I’ll put it here.” 
1 Of course this applies more particularly to those objects for 
which we are responsible. It is not intended to apply to a general 
searching for such opportunities where others should take the 
responsibility.
-P-A-G-E-250
238 HABIT-FORMATION 
The second habit, that of recognizing the out-of-placeness 
of things, is valuable, since through it there is not only a 
stimulation to a certain act, but the emotional unrest acts 
as an incentive for the third habit, that of returning things 
to their place. Both of these habits (the second and third) 
may therefore be considered together. They may be 
prompted by all sorts of situations. It does not follow 
that because one stimulus is reacted to promptly that 
another will be equally moving. Sometimes possessions 
at school will be neglected and those at home not. Some- 
times things of value will be cared for when things much 
more conspicuous, but of little value, are not. A person 
may have a place for his pen and pencil, but leave news- 
papers “all over the place.”’ He may be able to find his hat 
and umbrella, but not his glasses and his gloves. It follows, 
then, that there are many habits of keeping things in order 
and that wide application of the ideas and tendencies at 
their basis must be made, if one is to develop habits of order. 
In general, a study of habits of accuracy, attention, 
or others of the school discipline class will reveal a similar 
complexity and dependence on separate specific habits, 
on certain emotional habits, and more or less consciously 
accepted ideals of action, these themselves rapidly becoming 
automatic. . 
4. Additional habits involved in moral training. — It is 
evident that the detailed application of the fifty or more 
principles laid down in the preceding chapters must be 
left to the teacher with the special case.and need. Space 
would-not permit any consideration, point by point, of the 
separate habits involved either in school discipline or in 
moral training. 
In general, all of these habits involved.in the economical 
management of a school are moral in their tendencies. 
They are serviceable in society, as in school. The close
-P-A-G-E-251
DISCIPLINE AND MORAL TRAINING 239 
connection was noticed by Aristotle, who included all 
virtues under the genus, habit. . 
President Hyde,” in his admirable little book on “ Practi- 
cal Ethics,” takes a list of more than twenty objective rela- 
tions maintained by man, and gives the corresponding duty, 
virtue, reward, temptation, vices of defect and excess, 
and penalty. The close relation between habit and duty 
and between habit and virtue is quite strikingly illustrated 
by the fact that the following habits necessary in addition 
to those fundamental to the economical conduct of a 
school for moral training are found in President Hyde’s 
scheme either as duties or virtues. Duty implies habitual 
performance on the part of her devotees. Virtue is not ap- 
plied to sporadic or spasmodie plays of good will. It must 
have the stability characteristic of habit. Tocomplete, then, 
our list of important moral habits, we add: temperance in 
eating and drinking, cheerfulness, economy, prudence, 
clean-mindedness, kindness to animals, justice, devotion, 
f loyalty, patriotism, codperation, conscientiousness, ap- 
preciation of the beauty and marvel of nature, and an opti- 
mistic confidence in the Supreme One which will carry with 
it_an habitual tone of responsive, willing service. : 
The root concept at the basis of all these, as of school 
discipline, is service. In general we may trace the mode of 
( procedure in all by a consideration of the essentials in the 
development of habits of service. 
5. (a) The development of habits of service. — In select- 
ing and demonstrating the habit to be formed, any habit 
included in the realization of service appropriate to the 
child’s age would be worthy of a place. Nor does this 
exclude the most necessary development of his own

240 HABIT-FORMATION 
powers, if capacity to serve is to be gained. The recog- 
nized need on the part of himself or another for any help 
or assistance is evidently the stimulation starting the re- 
action which renders the helpful service or does the 
necessary deed. The nature of the habit may be made 
concrete by citing historical or literary instances. Lin- 
coln’s trudging miles into the country at the end of his 
day’s work to return to the old lady the few pennies 
accidentally overcharged, makes concrete the meaning of 
honesty not merely as an ideal, but as a habit. In- 
stances in the child’s own life of joy in the victory of 
benevolent impulses, and his chagrin and self-condemna- 
tion at his weakness in the face of opportunity or temp- 
tation, will furnish sufficient illustration of the use of his 
own experience. He may talk over with his teacher 
imagined situations, so that the embarrassment and 
awkwardness of a new plan may be more or less worn 
off. Then all that is needed is to really put his idea 
into practice, if possible, still under supervision. : 
6. (6) The initiative of service. — In arousing initia- 
tive, almost any of our selected list of instincts might do. 
The most useful would probably be imitation, play, 
curiosity, sympathy, sociability, expression, ambition, 
pride, independence, courage, approval, and disapproval. 
In various combinations they should prove effective in 
stirring the child to appropriate action. 
From the emotional standpoint, the altruistic and 
esthetic are in many cases closely associated with the 
moral. The child’s interest in and admiration. for vari- 
ous relatives and friends, as well as his regard for char- 
acters in stories and history, may be turned to account. 
However, the most fundamental and important emo- 
tional factor in stirring up initiative for moral action is 
to make pleasant associations with desirable, and un-
-P-A-G-E-253
DISCIPLINE AND MORAL TRAINING 241 
pleasant associations with undesirable, forms of reaction. 
These pleasant or unpleasant associations may be derived 
from any legitimate source. 
The importance of developing motives of the higher 
order is easily illustrated, if a person of limited educa- 
tion is asked how he would teach a child that it is wrong 
to lie or steal. Two answers are likely to be given on the 
average, —“I would teach him first that honesty is the 
best policy,” and secondly, “that he will be sure to be 
found out.” When the average young American learns to 
organize his experience into ideals and motives, then will 
the patriotic citizen view with complacency the lack of 
specific and purposive training in morals and religion. So 
far we have been indebted to the automatic processes only.’ 
Even in the world of business, in spite of the tendency 
toward honesty and uprightness inherent in general in 
business relations, competition. has often brought in 
questionable practices and lowered both ideals and 
standards, as well as motives. It is no less true in the 
school life of the child. The hurry and scurry to cram 
his mind with as many scraps of fact and fable as possi- 
ble in the minimum amount of time, has led to an almost 
complete neglect of the development of a wide range of 
worthy motives. It has been left to chance and the 
child’s automatic processes, with the result that the child’s 
reactions have been just good enough ordinarily to deceive 
those with his education in charge into thinking that all 
had been done that was necessary. 
The importance of adolescent motives as instanced by 
an increasing appreciation of responsibility to others can-

real or imagined, his ideals has previously been noticed. No great 
Teligion has been lacking such personages. It is the fundamental 
error in barring Bible history from the schools.
-P-A-G-E-254
242 HABIT-FORMATION 
not be overlooked in this connection. Their value in 
leading to conversion has been noticed earlier. 
7. (c) Practice and habits of service.— There is no 
need of making oceasions through which habits of service 
may be developed. The situation or occasion is always 
there with its direct or indirect opportunity for service. 
The only need is that the situation be clarified, that the 
specific habit of service to be applied may be made plain. 
Some people fail to realize that the highest service they 
can perform at times is to take some recreative exercise 
or a nap, and are ashamed of themselves every time they 
stop working. If attention is focused on a certain specific 
habit of service, the application of such habits will be 
simplified. Later other forms of service may become the 
object of endeavor. With varying degrees of efficiency in 
each instance, periods may be set for practicing this or 
that sort of service, the number of repetitions may be 
specified, favoring conditions and suggesting influences 
may be brought into play, and occasional exercise will 
keep up the utility to the maximum. There is hardly 
any other means of making practice actual rather than 
formal, except by arousing a serious intent to serve and 
by pointing out where the most attention is needed, as, 
for example, when self-interest and service conflict, or 
seem to conflict. 
8. (d) The prevention of exceptions. — To guard against 
exceptions, a child should be led to see that services are 
not merely to be performed, but are to be performed 
skillfully. Otherwise there will be serious rebuffs, rebukes, 
or possibly even violence, as well as almost equally dis- 
appointing ingratitude. Let him see how he may be prej- 
udiced in favor of himself in various instances. As far 
as possible these menaces are to be removed; but where 
they are bound to appear, a ridiculous overdrawing of
-P-A-G-E-255
7 eT 
| ee A 
NN, DISCIPLINE AND MORAL TRAINING 243 
cases may serve to add noteworthy associations which 
will reénforce waning initiative. So, too, the child may be 
warned against first tendencies or resolve definitely against 
lapses. The loss of self-respect, as well as the ridiculous- 
ness of failure, may supplement the initiatives already 
mentioned. Concrete reminders of his intention, the pain- 
ful consequences of lapse whether pictured or realized, 
and self-criticism should operate in some form with rela- 
tion to each habit to be included among those classed as 
habits of service. 
pF Are there general habits ? — Such classes of habits 
as are included in the list of school habits, and those 
added as essential in moral training, have been termed 
“general habits.” Perhaps because of their association 
with the old discredited notion of formal discipline, they 
have been neglected. It behooves us to consider what 
chance there is, therefore, that one habit may affect an- 
other. The distinction has already been made in Chap- 
ter IV that habits correspond to specific neural pathways. 
In what sense may they be generalized? Bagley has 
proved the term “formal discipline” to be self-contradic- 
tory, and Thorndike, while vigorously assailing a con-. 
ception of formal discipline which is largely a man of 
straw, shows better than any one else has done how to get 
the maximum results in general training out of specific 
training. 
Three points will show the possibilities of benefit from 
special training beyond the specific line of reaction sub- 
jected to practice. 
10. The possibility of common elements. —.1. The habit 
pathways may altogether or in part be common to two 
or to many operations perhaps externally very different, 
just as a habit of writing vertically the letters b, f, h, k, 
would be certain to carry with it the vertical position
-P-A-G-E-256
244 HABIT-FORMATION 
for the 1, as the same initial swing which was found in 
all the other letters is also found here. So most of the 
habits of speech and composition taught are available on 
occasion for application wherever they are common or 
similar to larger habits or to a larger field of activity. 
Professor Thorndike confuses himself by insisting on 
an identity here. He says the advocate of the disci- 
plinary value of composition and language overestimates 
here; that the ability to speak in language classes is not 
“identical with the ability to speak to jurymen in a law 
court, or to persuade voters.” He might have added 
with almost equal appropriateness that such is not identi- 
cal with the ability to umpire at a baseball game, or to 
announce trains at a railroad station. It is evident 
that; in so far as ability to express one’s self clearly is 
gained whether in or out of classes, it will be serviceable 
as far as that ability goes in aiding the lawyer, the poli- 
tician, the umpire, or the train-caller. We have no war- 
rant for expecting it to go further. Whether the real 
point is convincingness or argument, or the making of 
friends or constituents, the judgment of balls and strikes, 
or power of lung, surely training in English composition 
is not the only desideratum. It must, however, play its 
fundamental part wherever there is a place for spoken 
or written language. 
Professor Angell finds this “central factor common” 
to two mental processes in a “general attitude” involved 
in attention, later calling attention also to the “very real 
intellectual advantage” gained as a result of the “leverage 
given by system and organization.” 
The factors common to general improvement in logical 
memory are, according to Professor Pillsbury? summed

up in the following: “Habits of attention in general, and 
to one kind of material, not to another, are undoubtedly 
acquired through study of any kind. Even the habit of . 
using books intelligently needs to be acquired in the 
early stages, and, once acquired, can be transferred to 
other fields. Even more important is the capacity for 
selecting the important points and in properly knitting 
them to the related facts, to the facts and occasions that 
render their recall desirable. For most adult learning it 
is essential to remember the fact apart from the language 
in which it is expressed and apart from the particular 
connections in which it is first learned.” * 
11. The possibility of a common method of procedure. 
—~2. The method of procedure in the special habit may 
evidently be applicable to a much larger field? A card 
catalogue scheme is a method of keeping information 
which applies not only to libraries, but to lists of names 
in schools and other institutions, items of sale or expendi- 
ture, and otherwise according to the business or institu- 
tion where it is found available. It is general in its 
application. So. again a method of investigating. and 
sifting historical records may include getting habits of 
distinguishing between real and false data, habits of 
searching for motives, of inference back and forward 
from data, and habits of organizing material into a con- 
sistent system as far as any event is concerned, which 
cannot but have a very definite application as a method 
to the work of the lawyer in his examination of records 
‘Professor Meiklejohn finds in the logical eategories the basis 
for the factors common to both specific and general training. ‘See 
“Is Mental Training a Myth?” in Educational Review, Vol. 
XXXVIL, pp. 126-141. 
* Compare for this and the preceding, Thorndike, “Principles of 
Teaching,” pp. 244-245.
-P-A-G-E-258
246 HABIT-FORMATION 
of to-day as contrasted with those of yesterday or of 
many yesterdays. Similarly, but to a less degree, habits 
of observation as developed by nature study or natural 
sciences may tend to cultivate the habit of using one’s 
senses even of taste and smell rather than carelessly 
guessing at the facts and thus naming the new plant or 
shrub, perhaps incorrectly. 
Professor Pillsbury,’ in reviewing the investigation of 
Ebert and Meumann,? attributes the general increase of 
accuracy and quickness resulting from special training 
to “the acquirement of better methods of working, and 
of a familiarity with the material and processes that 
makes relatively interesting what at first is probably as 
uninteresting a task as can easily be jmagined.” A 
better method of procedure had been discovered, but in 
some particular phase it may have been disadvantageous. 
A person who plays tennis well with his right hand 
can easily win playing with his left hand in a contest 
with a beginner using his right. This fact is accounted 
for by the advantage furnished by previously formed 
habits of judging where the ball would strike, of placing 
himself near enough and not too near to swing’ freely 
and get a square shot, and of returning the ball where 
it would be difficult for his adversary to make a return. 
12. The extension of habit by variation and suggestion. 
— 8. Mental attitudes or ideals tend by chance varia- 
tion and by suggestion to extend their sphere of action. 
This accords with the general law of variation so im- 
portant in the improvement of adjustments. The sug- 
gestions may be largely internal, resulting from a lively 
play of imagination, or they may be predominantly ex- 
ternal, and therefore the outcome of imitative activity.

The clerk who comes into contact with a man who 
has system in handling and arranging the details of his 
office, is, in his desire to please, likely to develop syste- 
matic habiis himself. These will be applied first to the 
office duties. But gradually as he appreciates the ad- 
vantages of knowing just where everything is, and how 
this or that is to be done, he may become known as a 
“ crank on system,” and be ever on the lookout for oppor- 
tunities to ride this particular hobby, thus developing 
many habits which he would never have formed, had 
this ideal or attitude of mind not grown upon him. But 
it is not essential that this ideal should be so definitely 
developed. The habit of putting familiar syllables and 
words together in reading to make sounds corresponding 
to new words, may not be consciously gained; but hav- 
ing been gained in English, it will be applied to German 
or Latin or any other language similarly constituted, 
partly because of the common pathway or method of 
procedure above referred to, but partly because of the 
suggestion that, brings into play other activities, when a 
new or different situation is given serious consideration. 
A child may become familiar with the usefulness of a 
crowbar in moving heavy stones; he may get into a habit 
of thinking that that is the implement to use for the 
{ purpose. If some beam or log is to be moved, it is 
' altogether likely that the habit previously applied only 
to moving heavy rocks will be extended by suggestion 
to the problem of moving the log. A careless, unrelia~ 
{ ble child may be awakened by one teacher into habits 
' of reliability and trustworthiness. These habits tend 
j gradually to extend themselves not only in the child’s 
dealing with other persons, but to ever new fields of 
responsibility. The child who is diligent in one study 
which does not appeal to him, is likely to be so in others. 
A
-P-A-G-E-260
248 HABIT-FORMATION 
If he is habitually polite to one person or class of per- 
sons, suggestion is almost certain to extend the habit. 
' Praise received for the habitual quickness in one kind of 
work is very likely to inspire to habitual quickness in 
others for the sake of the approbation anticipated. What 
was at first a mere habit of working out puzzles may 
extend itself to invention, to scientific investigation or 
philosophical speculation, according as the suggestion of 
different environments varies. The habit of formulating 
a conclusion in a clear English statement is very likely to 
suggest an application far beyond the subject in the cur- 
riculum or the science which first called it forth.t 
13. Other arguments for general habits. — Aside from 
these three points in explanation of the, general effect of 
specific training, Dr. Hinsdale? claimed that there was 
by virtue of the exercise of one pathway an “energizing 
or mobilization” of the mind beyond the immediate 
channel more particularly involved. While there are 
facts which support this theory, they are more naturally 
and specifically accounted for by reference to the three 
sources of benefit through general training just discussed. 
Presumably, this energizing is not a transfer of energy 
into unaccustomed channels, but rather a functioning in _ 
a new connection of mental processes ordinarily working. 
in another combination. That is, there is a common 
element in the pathways involved. A greater readiness 
in one brings about, therefore, greater readiness in the 
more or less related reaction. 
1 See Chapter IV. for further illustration. If I have tended to 
emphasize this point disproportionately, my excuse is that the 
other two are more obviously and more often found in the litera- 
ture of forma] discipline, while this equally important mode has 
escaped notice.

DISCIPLINE AND MORAL TRAINING 249 
Corresponding to the joint improvement possible in 
similar functioning, Professor Judd has pointed out? 
that there may result a “reciprocal interference” or 
hindrance in opposed forms of action, just as in vision 
we are every now and then misled by habits of judging 
size and shape, or as a habit of “cutting” a ball in tennis 
extends itself to hitting a golf ball in spite of the dis- 
advantage in so doing. Specializing in any direction 
implies turning one’s back on other possibilities. 
Another argument that has been advanced in proof 
of the possibility of general training from specific activity 
is this very interference of activities, which has served for 
both sides of the debate over formal discipline. If this 
interference may even prove an obstruction, the nonavail- 
ability of .one form of training for another seems to 
be proven. This line of argument is to be answered by 
the following: Where interference is nof found, but on 
the other hand an improvement, either the common ele- 
- ment, causing the betterment in the method of procedure, 
or else helpful suggestion must be accountable, and the 
existence of a relation is evident. Where interference is 
found, those helpful factors may be lacking, but some 
relation must exist. That is, the method of procedure 
aiding in one case may be disadvantageous in another, 
and suggestions may be unfortunate as well as fortunate 
‘14. The teacher and general training. — With this 
threefold possibility in mind, it is evident that there are 
three principles for the teacher to follow, each with a 
retinue of many corollaries. (a) He may select in a 
given field habits fundamental or common to the widest 
range, and drill on similar applications of those habits, 
while at the same time avoiding the habits that would 
interfere. (b) He may secure valuable methods of pro-

250 HABIT-FORMATION 
‘ 
cedure and emphasize the attitude of mind as generally 
important in life. Narrowness, formalism, dogmatism, 
and a host of unfortunate elements in the method of 
procedure are to be avoided, while breadth, organization, 
criticism, and others advantageous are to be retained. 
(c) Finally he may not only develop definitely the ideals 
of action as generally applicable and to be applied, but 
may also increase the suggestibility of the habit taught, 
by substituting for chance suggestion specific applica- 
tions in as many directions as possible, thus extending 
the likelihood of future application. Breadth of knowl- 
edge and of training will count very greatly in widening 
out a teacher’s work and filling it with suggestion. It is 
evident that reviews from varying points of view, and 
other schemes for assisting the child to generalize or 
organize, all add to the possibility of suggestion. 
15. Protracted habit-formation. Special cases. — Be- 
sides their generality and complexity, another feature of 
the numerous school habits listed earlier in the chapter 
is the fact that none of them can be cultivated as habits 
in a single lesson, in an hour, or in a day.!| Most of them 
are brought into play only upon some special occasion, 
and these occasions will be very varied in character. 
The reaction, however, no matter how far apart the occa- 
sions for it may be, must invariably accord with the line 
of action of the proposed habit. How may such habits 
be secured? Is initiative to be developed? If so, what 
benefit may be expected to accrue from it two or three 
months later when an occasion may arise? In general, 
the study and demonstration of the habit are easy, 
but what new factors are raised by the sporadic ap- 
plication and development of a habit? 
As far as the initiative is concerned, it is pretty clear 
1 See page 278.
-P-A-G-E-263
DISCIPLINE AND MORAL TRAINING 251 
either that it must be renewed from time to time by new 
and varied suggestions and associations with sources of 
motive power, or that an atmosphere favorable to the 
habit must be created. The value of occasional talks in 
calling out worthy intentions or of a good military school 
for creating an atmosphere of obedience illustrates this 
development of initiative. 
The working up of practice in these habits is another of 
the difficult points. Shall the child be made to obey or to 
put things in order, or to do things quickly and accurately, 
merely for the sake of the practice, or merely to gain 
such habits? It seems superfluous under ordinary life 
conditions to add to the occasions for such habits. What 
is needed is the right mental attitude when the occasion 
occurs, and then the practice (and that of the right sort) 
will follow. Plain, bald practice in obedience, order, 
reliability, without any further aim than the practice, 
only bores, and is plainly disadvantageous rather than 
helpful in the formation of such habits. There are only 
two possibilities of using repetition in these particulars. 
The practice may be disguised so that its true aim is not 
apparent and the actions involved seem in themselves 
| to be worth while, or the practice may be concentrated 
j on a series of similar specific reactions included in the 
, general class. When occasion for practice arises, imita- 
{ tive practice may be even more useful than a more reflec- 
tive sort with young children, but there will be needed, 
sooner or later, the schemes for making the repetition 
} attentive and earnest, with help at the points of difficulty 
| and consideration of the method admitting of the greatest 
4 possibility of actual practice. A child’s habit of obedience 
j as far as his father and mother are concerned is formed 
early by imitation or suggestion. Later, as the habit is 
extended to the obedience to civic and moral law or
-P-A-G-E-264
252 HABIT-FORMATION 
authority, best methods, difficult points, earnestness, and | 
certain standards are necessarily considered, if the habit 
is to be an effective force in the child’s life. In the case 
of obedience, as in that of other disciplinary habits, 
there is peculiar difficulty in preventing exceptions, be- 
cause there can be, as a rule, no very clearly specified | 
time for guarding against them. The occasion arises for 
kindness, courtesy, diligence, independence, reliability, 
punctuality, and so forth, but attention is not directed 
to the initiative; the various warnings against lapses and | 
unpleasant experiences in connection with them have all 
by the passage of time lost the keen edge of their in- 
fluence. Obviously, the first essential aside from the — 
renewing of initiative is the reviving of the specific warn- 
ings against lapses, the furnishing of concrete reminders, 
and the promotion of self-criticism. 
The situations calling out the reaction may be of so 
varied a nature, some favoring it, some actually menac- 
ing it, that there is hardly any possibility of removing 
all menaces. Some of the more typical may be pointed 
out; and, when the habit shows itself in good results, 
commendation may help to produce others like them. 
It is evident then that, where habits are of these funda- 
mental types, lessons may be given for the sake of demon- 
strating their real nature, or of awakening various sorts 
of initiative. Sometimes both may be combined in one 
lesson. So, too, in specific habits included in a type or 
in imaginary instances, a certain amount of practice may 
be given in the course of one or more lessons. Still other 
lessons may be given to pointing out the tendencies to 
lapse, reénforcing initiative, and in various ways guarding 
against exceptions. But in spite of these lessons, the 
great force most likely to lead to success in the forma-| 
tion of disciplinary habits of this sort is the almost in-
-P-A-G-E-265
| DISCIPLINE AND MORAL TRAINING 253 
essant, quiet, but effective succession of suggestions from 
the teacher indicating the goal to be attained and the desire 
to attain it, while a word here or there serves to stir initia- 
tive and to guard against exceptions far more effectively 
than many a formal lesson could do. In forming all 
these habits, it is not so much the formal lesson that 
counts as the subconscious influence exerted by a teacher.’ 
16. The importance of a scientific scheme. — This does 
not mean that our various phases in the formation of 
habits are not practically useful. The teacher with the 
problem and with sufficient scientific interest in it has 
here all of its phases provided for. He may decide how 
much is to be a special lesson, how much is to be inci- 
dental, what phases will need to be reconsidered, and 
what will take care of themselves automatically. With 
a wise application of the scheme of habit-formation, the 
teacher or parent, experienced or inexperienced, can 
hardly fail to find all the important devices and methods 
for engendering disciplinary habits. If fifty devices have 
failed, the rest may be tried, and with a little ingenuity 
some of them ought to succeed. 
At the outset, however, for students still working theo- 
retically with only a small amount of practice, it will 
help greatly to make a detailed application to the most 
{ important of school habits with a view to discovering the 
J 
| maximum of his resources. The main function of the 
Scheme is, however, to influence the teacher subcon- 
sciously. The method with the suggestions involved will 
be bound to prove helpful incidentally even when no 
actual attempt to fall back upon it is made, and it is 
always available as a last resort. It would also be a 
desirable line of practice to treat formally various of the 
important habits involved in teaching of the special

branches of study and art. This is easily done on lines 
analégous to those used in this chapter. 
17. Summary. — To discipline a person wisely is so to 
manipulate his environment as to develop without waste 
of time or effort valuable habits. Training includes the 
sum-total of preparation for action. It therefore in- 
cludes an equipment of both ideas and habits. Discipline 
applies only to the latter. 
Of the habits in school discipline, the following are the 
most important: order, obedience, respect, reliability, 
independence, diligence, accuracy, quickness, carefulness, 
punctuality, kindness, courtesy, neatness, and erect pos- 
ture. Those to be added as contributing to scholarship, 
and hence, indirectly, to discipline, are: habits of attention, 
sense discrimination, observation, interpretation, inven- 
tion, logical memory, comparison, classification, inference, 
and accurate formulation. Habits of study are com- 
plexes of these. 
From the standpoint of moral training, the larger habits 
of service and self-control comprise habits of attention, 
‘inhibition,’ decision, exertion, and _expression by word 
and deed. 
These school habits are complex, made up of classes 
of similar habits, each with its narrower or broader im- 
plications. Order, for example, is made up of three 
habits, each of which may have its possible limitation in 
scope. They are (a) having one definite place for each 
separate object to be kept in order, (6) the habit of recog- 
nizing the out-of-placeness of things, and (¢) that. of re- 
turning them to their place. 
For moral’ training not only is the preceding sort of 
habits involved, but to them must.be added:- temperance 
h -in eating and drinking, cheerfulness, : ‘economy, dence, 
~¢lean-mindedness, kindness to animals, justice, deVotion,
-P-A-G-E-267

i y ‘ tf 
loyalty, patriotism, ‘codperation, conscientiousness; aippre- 
ciation of the beauty and marvel of nature, and an:opti- 
mistic confidence in the Supreme One which will carry 
with it an habitual tone of responsive, willing service. 
Service is the root concept of all discipline. The stimuli 
calling it forth are the recognized needs of the individual 
himself or of others. It is made concrete by historical or 
literary instances and the child’s own experiences, In- 
stinct, emotion, pleasant associations, moral standards, 
and ideals all may serve as initiative. These motives of 
the higher order may need to be developed. No occa- 
sion for practice need be artificially brought about. The 
j situations calling for service are always present. All 
ey need is clarifying. Separate habits may be prac- 
ed, however, with profit. The development of serious 
tent, and the guidance of attention to the main issue, 
e the necessities for actual practice. Skillful perform- 
ice, the use of a sense of humor, knowledge of prejudices, 
id warning against likely errors are the most valuable 
eans of preventing exceptions. 
There are three possibilities of benefit from special 
‘aining beyond the specific line of reaction subjected to 
ractice: (a) The habit pathways may altogether or in 
art be common to another or to many others. (6) The 
1ethod of procedure in the special habit may be evi- 
ently applicable to a much larger field. (c) Mental 
ttitudes or ideals tend by chance variation and by 
uggestion to extend their sphere of action. These sug- 
estions may be internal (ideational) or external (imi- 
ative) in their immediate source. The extension of 
1abits of order, obedience, trustworthiness, and so forth, 
Tom one person to another, and from one relation of life 
to many offers abundant illustration of this perhaps 
{ greatest factor in giving value to specific training. ,
-P-A-G-E-268
256 HABIT-FORMATION 
The “energizing of the mind” is rather to be explained 
by the above-mentioned possibilities, but the reciprocal 
interference of habits argues for the possibility of the 
joint improvement of those more closely related. 
The teacher must select habits fundamental or com- 
mon to the widest range of important habits, avoiding 
the obstructive; he must secure valuable methods of 
procedure and emphasize the attitude of mind as gener- 
ally important in life; and he must increase the sug- 
gestiveness of the habit taught by substituting for chance 
suggestion specific applications in as many directions as 
possible. Breadth of knowledge on the part of the 
teacher, and a wide scope for review, are therefore im- 
plied. . 
Disciplinary habits are usually protracted in their 
formation. This does not interfere with their selection 
and demonstration, but it does make necessary the re- 
newal of initiative, the emphasis of the right attitude, 
the use of those occasions for practice that arise naturally, 
and the preventing of exceptions by pointing out typical 
dangers, and commendation for effective effort. Accord- 
ing to circumstances the full lesson period may be assigned 
to any phase or combination of phases of the habit-form- 
ing process. The important thing where difficulty is found 
is to see that the teacher exhausts his resources by taking 
into account some systematic and comprehensive scheme 
of the possibilities.

-Hasrt-FormMine as APPLIED IN DRILL 
“Repetitio mater studiorum. ’ 
x. Drill’ more specific, less protracted. — Discipline 
and moral training involve a few habits of wide range of 
stimulus and reaction. In fact, the habit part of the ex- 
perience is represented by certain indefinite central ac- 
tivities which are common to all acts of that class. Were 
this amalgamation of diverse habits through common 
elements impossible, we could never collect in a score 
of words the essential concepts of either discipline or 
moral training. In the mastery of subject-matter, any 
attempt to do so would be absurd. To be sure, there are 
habits involved-in general intellectual and manual train- 
ing, — habits of attention, sense discrimination, observation, 
interpretation, invention, inference, formulation, careful- 
hess, accuracy, verification, and the like, — but besides 
these are thousands of habits of all degrees of complexity 
and importance, from that of recognizing a certain word, of 
thinking 63 whenever 7X9 is seen, to the habit of think- 
ing of the history of the United States or of England as 
made up of different epochs, and of locating new items 
of information in their appropriate connections. While 
those habits of larger application must be matters of 
gradual development in the course of a week or a term 
or longer, the less: complex habits may be secured in a

-P-A-G-E-270
260 HABIT-FORMATION 
furthered by arousing initiative, by furnishing occasions 
for practice, or by helping the child to exercise restraint 
in the face of threatening conditions? 
4. Habit-forming versus informational subjects. — Of 
the subjects taught in the elementary school, reading, 
writing, arithmetic, composition, spelling, singing, draw- 
ing, and other forms of manual work have habit-forming 
rather than information as their direct aim. Nature 
study, geography, history, and civics deal rather with 
the acquiring of information, the organization of facts. 
Some of these organizations need to become automatic, in 
order that rapid use may be made of them in relating new 
material, and others may contribute important aid in the 
formation of disciplinary or moral habits. History, 
especially without furnishing much material for direct 
habit-formation, indirectly contributes abundantly to 
morality and the habits implied in character by making 
concrete the ideas underlying such habits, by furnishing 
initiative through suggested motives, by making a basis for 
practicing habits of approval or disapproval, or by showing 
the painful, serious, and unfortunate results of lapses. 
In the high school, language subjects, mathematics, 
and the arts are largely habit-forming, while science, 
history, literature, and the like are informational, with 
oceasional organizations to be made automatic. 
No attempt can be made in the brief space of this — 
chapter to indicate all, or even a small part, of the diffi- 
culties that may be encountered by the teacher in con- 
nection with the many habits involved in the various 
subjects of the elementary schools. A few examples from 
the various subjects, however, will serve to aid with 
typical problems and to show the need of the application 
of the methodology of habit to the teaching of subject- 
matter.

5. Reading. — The habit of getting and rendering the 
meaning is to be striven for from the first. The sepa- 
ration of the word-drills. and phonetic exercises from 
the reading proper is a desirable way of avoiding the mere 
pronouncing of a series of words when reading. This un- 
fortunate pronouncing was promoted by the methods of 
the past. For a child read along until he reached a word 
he did not know, and then asked what it was. 
The expression of meaning necessitates first compre- 
hension of the meaning, at least of the main elements of 
a sentence, and then habitual modes of conveying that 
meaning to others. This double habit, consisting first 
of interpretation and then of oral reading, is promoted 
first by having the child study carefully the meaning 
in silence, and then by having him read orally. Habits 
of laoking for the period at the end of the sentence, and 
habits of recognizing individual words in or out of the 
sentence, are smaller habits, some of which may be ac- 
quired in a single lesson. 
A habit of looking for familiar words and syllables in 
new words, and so constructing the new, is most desirable 
and also implies a smaller habit of blending letters and 
syllables to make single compound sounds. It is evident 
that there are many other habits of importance in the 
teaching of. reading. 
In some of them, as in that of expressing meaning, 
the difficult point is to show the child the general nature 
of the reaction. In others it is hard to break the habit 
up into its subordinate reactions. In others to get a 
whole-hearted practice is hard, as in the pronunciation of 
words which seem to the child difficult or stilted. In 
getting new words by old forms and in blending, the pleas- 
ure attendant. upon success and the intellectual emotion 
will, when properly emphasized, continue the practice.
-P-A-G-E-272
262 HABIT-FORMATION 
Word-drills often amount to little, because the practice 
is merely formal. No initiative is invoked, and no attempt 
to prevent exceptions is made. In a purely formal way 
the teacher shows card after card. If one child misses, 
the teacher goes on in the same tone and asks the next 
child to repeat the miscalled word. In case of failure, 
he is often so pampered, and so much kindhearted and 
well-meant attention is bestowed upon him, that satisfac- - 
tion attends even his failure, and hence a possible future 
carelessness is fostered. An intelligent use of initiative 
and guarding against lapse is essential to progress, even in 
so definite a direction as this. 
The value of practice in reading is not often enough 
fully appreciated. The right sort of practice cannot be 
gained by reading the same book or the same two books 
many times. Those schools and those methods which en- 
able the children of the first year to read fifteen of the 
ordinary first-year books in their first school year must 
be given the preference over those which keep the child 
reading the same book over and over again. The writer 
has known a child to be able to read (?) any selected page 
of a primer, in spite of the fact that the greatest part of 
the page that he read was hidden from his view. 
6. Composition. — In composition, evidently, the. habit 
of speaking and writing in sentences, of dividing them into 
clauses and phrases for a closer glimpse of the parts, is 
the essential. But before that a habit of free expression 
must be developed. Later, as free expression becomes 
too facile, it must be tempered by habits of self-criticism. 
The substitution of correct for incorrect forms means 
getting a habit where there is already a habit path es- 
tablished; that is, not only making but breaking a habit. 
All the points for preventing lapses become of great 
importance here as pointed out in the chapter on the
-P-A-G-E-273
ee 
ie 
NE 
lS” HABIT-FORMING AS APPLIED IN DRILL 263 
breaking of habits. Very little ingenuity has been shown 
hitherto in this regard, compared with the possibilities. 
Play serves well as an initiative to practice here. A child 
hides behind a door. The hunter asks, “Is it Mary?” ~ 
“No, it isn’t she.” “Is it James?” ‘No, it isn’t he.” 
“Ts it Louise?” “Yes! It is I,” or “Who was sitting in 
my chair?” “Were you?” “I was.” “Was I sitting 
there too?” “You were a short time ago.” Forms thus 
used by the children are likely to get sufficient attention 
to bring them into common use instead of the more usual 
incorrect form. It is a mode of making practice actual 
which is applicable to substitutes for most of the common 
incorrect expressions of children. 
To teach children successfully the habit of writing in 
paragraphs requires a considerable study of the nature of 
that habit. With many teachers it merely means, — 
“When you have finished what you were writing and are 
conscious. of change in the direction of thought, start 
@ Dew paragraph for whatever new topic is introduced.’ 
A better plan would be to have the child led by the 
teacher to make a rough outline of what he is going to 
write about; and this is the usual method. Letter forms, 
as well as the various points of capitalization and 
punctuation, should be taught as habits, not as rules, 
and the teaching of grammar should result in principles 
which should be habitually applied to all new and un- 
certain forms or expressions, the new or uncertain form 
serving as the stimulus for inhibitive processes until 
either verified, or at least not condemned, by grammati- 
cal principles. 
The habits of distinguishing between ways of treating 
narration, description, and exposition is also to be recom- 
mended as a preparation for a form of treatment in which 
these methods are complicated. In this work enough
-P-A-G-E-274
264 HABIT-FORMATION 
actual practice is difficult to obtain without an initiative 
strong enough to induce the children to make the dis- 
tinction outside of school in extra’ writing, whether in 
correspondence with their friends or just for the sake of 
practice.* a 
7. Penmanship. —In penmanship the most open neg- 
lect of the methods of habit-getting is to be found. 
The ordinary plan is for the teacher to exhibit a word or 
words on the board or in the copy book, to warn the 
children of certain dangers, sometimes even illustrating 
them (and so suggesting them to the children who might 
never commit that form of error), and to have the actual 
writing begun. Then the teacher watches them, and when 
some have finished tells them to put down their pens or to 
write another line, and so on. After a while the children 
hold up their papers for inspection, and the exercise is © 
over. Other teachers, by many devices, get the children 
interested and eager to turn out a better copy than ever 
before. Then they are shown how to make a good copy, 
the right way of doing all the hard parts being demon- 
strated. While they are writing, they are reminded by 
quiet remarks of the teacher, now of their initiative and 
good intentions, now of the difficult features. 
When they are through with one copy, that is ex- 
amined to see where and how that could be improved. 
Then it is folded under or covered with the blotter (to 
avoid imitation of the wrong thing) and a new copy is 
made, while the teacher guards against exceptions to the 
1 For further applications of habit-forming in the separate 
branches of the school curriculum, see the Index under the head- 
ings Arithmetic, Reading, etc. 
Spelling is so evidently a case of habit-getting that it has served 
as a basis for illustration at some length in Chapter VII., pages 111- 
114. With the exception of the large underlying habits there pointed 
out, it is a very simple case of getting small specific habits.
-P-A-G-E-275
HABIT-FORMING AS APPLIED IN DRILL 265 
right forms by such timely use of the suggestions of Chap- 
ter X, and the like, as seem to fit the situation. 
Much time is lost by having different systems or styles 
of writing in different parts of a city or in different grades. 
A goodly percentage of the poorer pupils move two or 
more times during the school year. Change in systems of 
writing should be introduced only in the lowest grades. 
The pressure upon large systems for change in styles 
of penmanship would be materially lessened if boards 
of education ruled that changes should never be imposed 
above the third school year except as the children carried 
on the new form to the higher grades. The wholesale 
sweeping aside of the habits of children in the middle 
and higher school years in the quest of a theoretically 
rather than a practically superior form of penmanship is 
one of our most inexcusable pedagogical errors. It could 
not be justified even on the ground of a considerable 
superiority in the speed or artistic effect secured by the 
new method. 
8. Arithmetic. — Arithmetic is essentially a habit sub- 
ject.1 The ideas involved in arithmetic are compara- 
tively few, if its commercial features are eliminated. 
Almost every idea included in the subject is to become 
automatic. The laws of habit-formation show the 
economy of combining the separate processes skillfully 
into as few habits as possible. For example, 6+9=15 
may represent one habit; 9+6 may be made to serve as 
another; 15—9 and 15—6 may serve as two more. These 
might be taught separately, and possibly without a child’s 
discovering the relation, if enough other combinations 
1 For evidence of the variety of habits involved, see Stone’s 
“ Arithmetical Abilities, some Factors determining Them, Columbia 
University Contributions to Education,” Teachers College Series, 
No. 19. New York, 1908.
-P-A-G-E-276
266 HABIT-FORMATION 
were put in each of the four groups represented. On the 
other hand, a child may learn as one habit, eg., 
6t9=15C0o 2 or +O Drs 
Four habits are thus amalgamated in one. 
Again, in percentage and its application many texts 
require a different set of rules and habits for each applica- 
tion. Evidently one set of habits is at the bottom of all 
work in percentage. The peculiarities may be added to 
this basis, but it is unreasonable to require a large number 
of different sets of habits. So, too, in dealing with ordinary 
and decimal fractions, one standard method should be 
taught for manipulating each kind. If a child is ingenious 
enough to discover other and quicker or shorter ways, 
he may use them, but for the child who cannot discover 
his own short cuts, one habit is greatly to be preferred to 
many. It is only recently that concrete ways of demon- 
strating these arithmetical habits and the value of con- 
necting them with past experience have been properly 
appreciated. 
The problem of getting initiative for arithmetical autom- 
atisms is comparatively easy. The whole social ex- 
pectation demands an ability to compute. It is only 
occasionally when bad habits of work have been formed, 
and lead to discouragement, that a special initiative is 
needed. In such cases the value of successes, no nm -**-~ 
how far back one must go to secure them, must 1 
ignored. Discouragement may only be conquer 
very decided encouragement.. The teacher may 
on other initiative possibly at the beginning, but __ 
paratively soon resulting satisfaction must be *-'* 
As a rule, children rather like doing-example, 
no greater excitement is at hand. Given a gy: 
 
-P-A-G-E-277

| HABIT-FORMING AS APPLIED IN DRILL 267 
for this work when nothing else may be done, and they 
will figure very industriously. If a certain premium 
in the way of special privilege is put upon quickness 
combined with accuracy, the practice will be of the desir- 
able sort. : 
Preventing exceptions is largely a matter of guarding 
against the errors which the teacher has learned by ex- 
perience are likely to beset the child in his work. Self- 
criticism and checking off processes by other ways of 
computing to see whether the result is reasonable, will 
aid in preventing exceptions.’ 
So far it is rather numerical calculation than problem 
work which has been considered. This last was touched 
upon in a former chapter, and its need of graduation from 
the less difficult to the more difficult was indicated as well 
as the need of forestalling habits of guessing. During the 
last fifteen years the study of geometry has been revolu- 
tionized. Instead of mere mechanical memorizing, the 
student thinks his way through the fundamentals. A 
somewhat similar change is needed in problem work in 
arithmetic. Instead of a heterogeneous hit-or-miss series, 
a carefully graded series, starting with the least difficult 
and working up slowly to the harder problems, should 
be worked out on the basis of the habits involved. The 
importance of working back to where the child succeeds 
is nowhere in arithmetic as important as in problem work. 
9. Music (Singing). — A failure to analyze the problem 
of teaching music has resulted in many peculiar practices, 
when its intimate relation to habit is considered. Musi- 
cians desire a high degree of technical skill. That means 
habit of one sort. But they also desire and regret their 
inability to get “soul” or “touch” or “feeling,” all of 
which refer to habits of a very different sort. It is quite 
1 See page 196.
-P-A-G-E-278
268 HABIT-FORMATION 
common to take such measures to secure technical skill 
that musical taste is thereby rendered impossible. No 
child can form habits of appreciation and of delicate, 
soulful expression who is made to practice the “same 
old” inartistic exercises year in and year out, unless 
he is fired by a tremendous initiative or finds some excep- 
tional resulting satisfaction in the marked progress due to 
unusual aptitude. 
In teaching singing, as a rule at least, one of the three 
important sets of habits involved has been neglected. 
Schools which have taught the children to read difficult 
music easily at sight have drilled on exercises which 
lacked all claims to the name of music. Schools which 
succeeded in getting these two factors, skill in reading and 
real appreciation of music, have neglected the habits of 
using the voice skillfully. An astonishing number of 
schools succeed in accomplishing little beyond developing 
a hit-or-miss appreciation of a semi-sentimental sort. 
Habits of using the voice correctly, habits of appreciation 
and of appreciative expression, and habits of sight reading 
are the three sorts of habits to be established in n teaching 
these subjects. 
Much remains to be done toward making concrete the 
methods of using the voice. Probably few outside of the 
professional voice trainers are competent, and charts, 
drawings, and the like have not yet been produced of a 
practical sort. With the exception of the boy who has the 
idea that it is feminine to sing, and the girl or boy who 
is inclined to be “a monotone” and finds singing difficult 
and disappointing, initiative is easily secured in singing, 
and with it practice, but this last needs to be guarded 
by devices to ward off carelessness. Exceptions must be 
similarly provided for, and especially when discouraging 
and difficult points are involved such as are inherent in

the correct use of the voice, where the child may easily 
fail to see the importance of accurately placing his tones. 
10. Drawing and other forms of manual training. — In 
all of the so-called expressive arts, an analysis will reveal 
very much the same division of subordinate habits as were 
found in the preceding: habits of manipulating certain 
tools, habits of appreciation, and habits of interpretation. 
A definite purpose is to be accomplished. Certain ideas 
are brought to bear upon it as appropriate. The problem 
is worked out in the light of these ideas through the skill 
in the use of pencil and paper, color, wood working, iron 
working, sewing, embroidery, or some other art. Without 
habits of appreciation no artistic result is likely to be ac- 
complished. The great source of initiative is found in the 
interest of the child and in his success. The source 
of exceptions lies in demanding too much, in fatigue, and 
in the waning of initiative as the exercise becomes an old 
story. Another factor is the fact that a small slip or a 
moment of carelessness may ruin the work of days or 
months, thus producing a resulting dissatisfaction fatal 
to the continuance of practice. The great task of the 
teacher must therefore be to keep up the initiative by in- 
genious reminders, to warn the child at danger points, to 
encourage him when he is conscious of failure, but, above 
all, so to adapt the task to the child that he will gradually 
develop the maximum of power desired. 
Manual training has often been heralded as the savior 
of the boy whose mind works along the lines of his hands. 
Such work means doing. It is undoubtedly a boon to 
mnany a child who is counted dull from the point of view of 
literary pursuits. But manual training means more than 
doing; it means doing accurately, deftly, and neatly, and 
exacts its penalties for failure to work earnestly and 
eagerly, It often happens that the slouchy, careless dul-

lard in the ordinary studies is, after the novelty has worn 
off, the blundering, inaccurate, and unsuccessful worker 
in mechanical drawing and carpentry. An initiative is 
needed here for the broad fundamental habits which were 
discussed in a previous chapter. They need to be devel- 
oped not through any one lesson or in connection with 
any one subject. All must combine to this end. 
1x. Natural science, geography, history, and civics. — 
In no subjects, however, do these disciplinary funda- 
mental habits play a greater réle than in these so-called 
informational subjects. These are not studied that the 
child may retain for a long time the separate facts learned. 
It is expected that the child will forget many facts of 
science, geography, and history. Two advantages accrue 
to the child besides the information secured. First, 
material is given him for the furthering of habits of the 
broader type, such as habits of observation, interpretation, 
analysis, inference, and formulation, and to these may be 
added habits of reverence, protection, sympathy, pa- 
triotism, conscientiousness, etc.1 
On the other hand, there are certain organizations of 
fundamental facts which help the child to understand and 
place new knowledge. Probably no two teachers would 
agree as to what organizations were the essential ones, 
but in the main they are for each individual teacher 
those which he picks out for reviews and for drill. Com- 
missions composed of theorists, supervisors, and practical 
teachers should earefully consider what these essential 
habits are, and on the basis of the scheme here presented 
how these essential habits are to be attained, if they are 
of the same difficult sort. Due allowance must be made, 
however, for the difference in conditions — urban, subur- 
ban, rural, or semirural conditions. Examinations from

some central source, city or state, are the nearest ap- 
proach that we make toward emphasizing drill, because 
teachers notice the points frequently touched upon by the 
examination questions and drill upon them. 
It seems to be placing a great burden on initiative to 
expect it to suffice for making automatic these essential 
organizations. The real source of initiative must be drawn 
from an interest in the subject and an appreciation of the 
importance of making this organization automatic. These 
interests are themselves habits in many instances, but serve 
to carry other habits still further. 
In the case of nature study and geography, habits of 
determining structure and function in detail, of looking 
for underlying principles and seeking to apply them to 
the improvement of man’s condition, are fundamental. 
In the case of history analogously, the essential habits 
include the accumulation and sifting of data, the organiza- 
tion of facts into laws of man’s social development, the 
habitual search for application of those laws in the avoid- 
ance of the errors of the past, and the profiting by the 
successes of our forefathers. Thus it is easily seen that 
history in this sense (and literature as distinct from reading 
must be classed with it) is a great wellspring for the devel- 
opment of initiative of all sorts, a basis for imitation and 
ambition, and perhaps, above all, functioning as the most 
important means of demonstrating concretely the true 
meaning of most of the habits noticed in connection with 
the economical conduct of a school and in relation to 
moral training. 
The subject, civics, may be made to cover almost as 
much ground as moral training. Good citizenship im- 
plies the highest possible service. Usually, however, it is 
made to include those points of information necessary 
1 See pages 134 ff.
-P-A-G-E-282
272 HABIT-FORMATION 
for the understanding and appreciation of American 
institutions, but besides that there is at least a hope that 
habits of codperation may be developed both for the 
election of worthy representatives and for the assistance 
of the various departments of such governmental or civic 
activity as education, the distribution of mail, the de- 
tection and prevention of crime, the administration of 
justice, sanitation, street-cleaning, and protection against 
fire. If such habits are to be formed, they must have 
some opportunity to function in definite reactions, if not 
in a public way at least in a narrower field, such as is 
furnished by the “school city” or some less complicated 
social organization. 
12. High school subjects. — Space forbids even the 
cursory treatment of the high school subjects except 
to indicate that practically all high school work in foreign 
or ancient languages has as its aim habits of automatic 
interpretation, appreciation, and expression. The work 
in higher mathematics is analogous with that in arithme- 
tic, while the sciences are still of the same general type 
and with the same fundamental aims in high schools as 
in the lower schools. 
13. Unconscious repetition or drill.—- A well-known 
teacher of history, when asked what habit was the most 
essentially involved in the teaching of history, replied, 
“a habit of tolerance.” By this he implied an habitual 
respect for others’ successes and failures, for their points of 
view, education, and their reactions to changing condi- 
tions of environment. Such habits are not established 
by definitely concentrating on them. That too often 
arouses a sort of counter suggestion. The sort of initiative 
which is effective is based on imitation skillfully suggested, 
with considerable emphasis of approval and disapproval. 
In fact, it is quite possible that the very best way to
-P-A-G-E-283
  HABIT-FORMING AS APPLIED IN DRILL 273 
bring about in a child such a habit is to make no attempt 
to teach it all, but merely to comment naturally and 
frankly as one would regardless of any thought of teaching. 
The teacher in general whose mantle of teaching becomes 
too evident, and is bordered with pedantry, loses much 
of the power that belongs to him who assumes the-habili- 
rents of the ordinary man and borders his mantle with a 
combination of kindliness and optimism. His loss of in- 
fluence and of ability to develop initiative in others is due 
to counter suggestion. That is, elements of a situation 
intended to influence a person in one way are disregarded, 
and other elements of the situation lead to a reaction 
counter to the one desired. The easiest. way to get some 
people to fall in line with your plans is to ask them to do 
the opposite, an extreme case of counter suggestion. 
There is no doubt that many habits of a religious, semi- 
religious, or moral character are never really presented 
nor drilled upon. They develop naturally and inciden- 
tally, and it is safe to allow them to develop in that way, 
remembering that unconscious learning is the best kind, 
if it succeeds. . 
All habits of wider application, like the protracted 
types of disciplinary habits, have elements of unconscious 
learning in them; habits of appreciating the scheme of 
nature as revealed in physics and chemistry, of catching 
the atmosphere of the French or German language, of look- 
ing for the elements in history which make for the success 
and failure of nations, are only established in the course of 
time as a result of much untaught learning and organizing 
on the part of the pupil. The formula corresvonding to 
the habit might have been given almost at the outset, but 
the habit in its full development is the product of time, 
ie. the product of numerous instances of unconscious 
though reflective practice. 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
274 HABIT-FORMATION 
14. Summary. ~~ The problems of drill are complicated 
both by the pressure of the broad fundamental habits and 
the smallest and most specific of automatisms. Drill is 
the process of artificially promoting repetition for the sake 
of getting facility in some branch of study. 
Courses of study should indicate where important 
habits are to be formed. Books on special method should 
show how these habits are to be formed. Teachers 
must in any case analyze the lesson for the habits implied. 
Subjects may be classified according as they are predomi- 
nantly habit-forming or informational. 
In the subject of reading, rendering the meaning pre- 
viously obtained through silent interpretation, separating 
word-drills from the reading exercise, looking for familiar 
parts of words and “blending” them, are all important 
for the best reading habits." Perfunctory phonetic exer- 
cises, pampering and lack of criticism of the expression 
which is allowed to pass, are common sources of exception. 
In composition, free expression, the gradual examina- 
tion of work more and more critically on the basis of the 
sentencapand its parts, correction of common errors, and 
the use of play as initiative, are adaptations of the 
principles of habit-forming. The learning of paragraphing, 
letter forms, punctuation, capitalization, and the appli- 
cation of grammatical principles should be largely 
habit-formation. There should also be an automatic 
distinctidn made between the ways of treating narration, 
description, and exposition. 
Penmanship is dependent on interest and effort, on the 
knowledge in advance of the dangers, on casual reminders, 
on comparison, and on preventing the children from 
copying what they have just been writing. Great harm 
is done by having different systems of penmanship in cor- 
responding grades of different parts of the same school
-P-A-G-E-285
HABIT-FORMING AS APPLIED IN DRIEB 275 
system and by too great readiness for wholesale experi- 
ment with one system of writing after another. 
In arithmetic the elementary combinations must be 
unified as far as possible. Percentage and its applica- 
tions should be made a unit. Ordinary processes in whole 
numbers, fractions, and decimals should be performed ac- 
cording to one standard scheme, the child being allowed 
l to use other short-cut methods when he discovérs them 
{ for himself. Getting initiative in general is not difficult. 
, When a child’s bad habits of work, as for example in 
problems, have led to discouragement, it is all-important 
to take him back where successes are possible. The care- 
, {ul graduation of all teaching of arithmetic is extremely 
necessary. : 
In all theso-called expressive arts, habits of manipulatin; 
q certain tools (from the human voice to the chisel), habits 
of appreciation, and habits of interpretation or expression 
are implied. Methods may be selected, as has often 
happened in music, which will serve the one and make 
¥ impossible the other; or certain important habits may 
{ be overlooked in the zeal for others. In manual exercises 
{ the evident accomplishment of a piece of work is a valu- 
able source of iniiagre, while the great sources of excep- 
tion lie in demanding too much, in fatigue, and in the waning 
of initiative, especially when some slip has ruined the 
‘ work of days or months. The teacher’s task is to keep up 
the initiative by ingenious reminders, to encourage at the 
time of failuré, and above all to adapt the task to the 
' ability of the child. Much of the method of manual work 
should be along the line of securing disciplinary habits. 
In natural science, geography, history, and civics two 
advantages accrue to the child aside from the information 
secured. Material is given for the furthering of habits 
of the broader type, and certain organizations are gained,

oi new knowledge may find its place. The essential 
organizations which are to be made automatic should be 
worked out on the basis of a methodology of habit. Inter- 
est becomes the source of initiative ordinarily in these 
subjects, which are too large for other sources to influence 
effectively. Habitual reactions must lead either through 
science to better ‘understanding and eventual improve- 
ment of man’s condition, or through history to the avoid- 
ance of the errors and the profiting by the successes of our 
forefathers. Civics should train in the habits funda- 
mental to good citizenship and actually furnish oppor- 
tunities for practice through some form of social organiza- 
tion. Many habits are taught unconsciously through 
skillfully suggested imitation. Pedantry defeats this 
through counter suggestion. All’ of the géneral discipli- 
nary habits have elements which are formed unconsciously.

CoNncLUSION 
“Train up a child in the way he should go, and even when he is 
old he will not depart from it.’”” ~ Proverbs xxii. 6. 
1. The limitations in application.— If the practical 
teacher is aided in putting his practice on a scientific 
basis, or at least in the realization that there is an estab- 
lished and scientific foundation on which his method must 
test, this book will have accomplished its purpose. Most 
teachers have studied psychology, but of few could it be 
said that much study (of psychology, at least) had made 
them mad. Rather the intricacies of the subject have 
often been made so glaringly apparent and the applica- 
tions so remote or trivial that the teacher has not found in 
the subject the help that could reasonably be expected. 
Tt is one thing to lay down principles, quite another 
to interpret and apply them. The author has been in- 
clined again and again to work out definitely sundry 
of the habits involved in discipline or the course of study, 
with a view to assisting the practical teacher. The dif- 
ficulty is that it would take a disproportionate amount 
of space to do anything helpful for teachers in general, 
and even then the real application would have to be made 
by the teacher himself under his conditions and in answer 
to his needs. Consequently, it has been hoped that by 
abundant illustration in the earlier chapters and by a 
consideration of the special difficulties in the problems 
taised by the three chapters preceding this, that the book 
might be made equally helpful in its suggestion. 
217

278 HABIT-FORMATION 
There are four topics which deserve at least a cursory 
glance in conclusion: (a) the relation of habit-formation to 
the lesson periods, (6) the need of a criterion for experience, 
© over-habituation, and (d) the future study of habit- 
formation. 
2. Habit-formation and the lesson period. — It is quite 
evident from what has preceded that it is seldom possible 
to establish a habit in a single lesson period. The idea 
may be furnished, but the facility necessary for habit is 
not gained without more practice than is ordinarily 
possible in the limited time of a lesson period. One or 
more periods might be given to the demonstration of the 
habit, one or more to the initiative, several to practice, 
always with more or less recalling of initiative, and still 
other periods or parts of several could be given to prevent- 
ing exceptions. On the other hand, all of these may in a 
simple arithmetical combination be reduced to a single 
period, though it would not be desirable to end the prac- 
tice there. 
In the case of habits involved in discipline, various 
phases of the habit more commonly work in incidentally 
with other teaching. The morning exercises serve as a 
time for emphasizing or demonstrating the nature of the 
reactions desired, or for kindling initiative. Then casual 
reference to that instruction or incentive is made during 
the day, as occasion arises. In the greater and smaller 
organizations involved in the course of study, now initia- 
tive and demonstration, now initiative and practice, 
and now demonstration, practice, and preventing excep- 
tions or any other of the possible combinations of these 
four main divisions of the methodology of habit, are 
combined in a single lesson period, other periods following 
with other combinations of the phases of habit-formation 
until the process has been completed.
-P-A-G-E-289
CONCLUSION 279 
3. A criterion for experience. — The writer has much 
more confidence in the ability of teachers to work out 
experimentally the best methods of accomplishing their 
various tasks than he has in the ability of the psycholo- 
gists to solve these problems, unless the latter get 
intimately acquainted with classroom situations. The 
best results should be obtained through joint experimen- 
tation. 
The great trouble has been that teachers narrow them- 
selves down to a system of teaching reading, arithmetic, 
kindergarten subjects, and so forth, following their scheme 
too exclusively. There isenough good procedure in teach- 
ing available for the determination of the most successful 
methods, both of getting ideas and habits, when the abun- 
dance of excellent teaching through the country at large 
is taken into account. Data of this sort must be recorded 
much more carefully, with greater detail, and for a longer 
period of time than is usual at present, in the case of habit- 
formation. When such records are available, they need 
to be organized according to some valid, comprehensive 
scheme. The experiences of successful teachers are 
always helpful, but are oftentimes so conflicting that a 
criterion for judging their correctness from a scientific 
point of view, and for making more complete search for 
other possible devices, has long been needed. It is hoped 
that the principles laid down in this book may serve some 
such useful purpose. In so far as any device in question 
serves to promote the study of the habit by the teacher, to 
make its nature clear to the child, to kindle his initiative, 
to further his practice, and to prevent exceptions, in so 
far it is good and the only questions left are, “Would not 
another device be still more efficient at certain points?” 
and “What is the relative value of the points of strength 
; and weakness inherent in this device as compared with
-P-A-G-E-290
280 HABIT-FORMATION 
another?” Many times we are obliged to admit the 
practical evenness of the balance and the truth of the old 
maxim that “there are many ways of relieving a feline 
of its pelt.” That fact, however, doés not lessen the desir- 
ability of some basis for judging the method on that 
account. Pedagogics has been the very prey of the 
method monger for just the reason that it lacked any 
scientific system of possibilities. This book is a step in 
that direction, since it does claim to have organized the 
usage of good teachers and to have reduced the data 
to form for a place in a science of education. 
It is by no means asserted that to be a good teacher 
everybody must follow out a set procedure, or that every 
good teacher does it consciously. It és asserted that, 
consciously or not, every good teacher accomplishes the 
results that would be accomplished by consideration of this 
sort. Presumably these results are not obtained or ob- 
tainable by chance. Deep down in consciousness analyses 
are being made and réactions are modified by them 
without the teacher’s noticing the fact. The experienced 
and successful teacher should be gratified to discover 
both where his practice is pedagogically sound and 
covers the ground of its possibilities, and where he has. 
not exhausted his resources. The right point of view 
will not help him alone, but will also light the path of 
the inexperienced, and not only save them many years of 
experience to reach the same degree of skill, but will gain 
them a power to develop quite beyond that reached by 
teachers who succeed through experience alone. Teaching 
is an artistic pursuit. It is never perfect. 
4. Over-habituation. — Radestock, in his monograph 
on “ Habit in Education,” in common with others, empha- 
sizes to a considerable degree the disadvantages of ex- 
treme or over-habituation. Although the subject is,
-P-A-G-E-291
CONCLUSION 281 
strictly speaking, somewhat removed from the process of 
forming habits, the writer wishes to take issue at several 
points with the point of view implied by the term. There 
is no such thing as over-habituation. There is such a 
thing as mal-habituation and what might be called 
under-accommodation, #.e. the loss of ability to make new 
adjustments. Ifa man becomes absent-minded at times 
and has a far-away look in his eyes, it does not indicate 
too many habits, but rather that he lacks the ability to 
direct his attention to the task at hand and to suppress 
the pleasant reminiscence. It is a case of mal-habituation 
or disproportionate habituation. Any unfortunate habit 
may be considered one habit too many, but it is rather a 
| 
i 
{ 
4 case of mal-habituation. On the other hand, in old age 
men and women gradually cease to come in contact with 
new situations, and consequently to make new adjustments. 
There is an ever increasing reliance upon automatic 
action and a growing dislike for new adjustment. To 
what degree this is necessary is a serious question. 
With the failure to keep up physical exercise as a result 
of various ills, presumably a certain amount of ambition 
and adaptability disappears, since these imply physical 
energy and the opening up of new brain connections. 
Exceptions seem to prove the possibilities under wiser 
guidance. The writer recently met a man who had been 
playing golf two years, starting when he was eighty-one 
years old. He was playing a good game, which showed 
clearly the ability to make new adjustments. The fact 
that he started in to play a new sort of game at such an 
advanced age is additional) evidence of his adaptability. 
We often meet the aged person of keen mind and wit. 
But more often the loss of spontaneity or the ability to 
make new adjustments is evident. The person has become 
a machine, a creature of habit. In one sense he is certainly 
over-habituated.
-P-A-G-E-292
282 _ _HABIT-FORMATION 
Perhaps the most serious cases of over-habituation are 
found among the unskilled laborers of the peasant and 
matured child-labor classes. Where year in and year 
out the same task, the same food, the same dwelling, and the 
same outlook deadens all ambition, over-habituation in the 
sense of under-accommodation early assumes full sway. 
Somewhat of variety and of occasion for play of the 
imagination is necessary to preserve the mental spark 
that makes for progress. Ona smaller scale, those in the 
most favored surroundings gradually condemn themselves 
to ignorance of one branch of knowledge after another, 
until, in the end, the performance of a daily round be- 
comes habitual and practically invariable. 
5. The future scientific study of habit-formation. — 
Elsewhere the author has alluded to the meagerness of the 
aid rendered our problem by psychology and to the neglect 
of habit-forming by educational theorists. He knows of 
no school habit of discipline or drill which has been investi- 
gated scientifically from the standpoint of its formation. 
Even in the cases of habit-forming in other fields, which 
have been studied scientifically, either the mode of study- 
ing and demonstrating the habit has been neglected, or 
else the methods of getting initiative, practicing or prevent- 
ing exceptions, have been slighted. In general, these habits 
have been studied for the amount of repetition and the 
time of practice with little regard to such manifestly 
disturbing and variable factors as initiative, interpretation 
of the problem, attention, quality of practice, and the meas- 
_ ures for avoiding errorsor lapses. Only a beginning has been 
made. Investigations are needed which will give a general 
criterion of what may be expected in connection with the 
various kinds of drill. If special method is ever to reach 
@ scientific basis, instead of ignoring all attempt to get 
at the automatic elements involved, it must investigate
-P-A-G-E-293
CONCLUSION 283 
them with regard to the main subdivisions of the habit- 
forming process. The author believes that neither ex- 
perimental psychology nor experimental pedagogy can 
ignore these main issues without seriously vitiating the 
results. So in thedetails of school management and disci- 
pline, as well as moral training, while their generality 
will not make them as fruitful a field for the scientific 
experimentalist, there is no less need of careful records and 
statistics regarding the various habits included in those 
terms. These investigations should be of a character to 
show such analyses of the habits, such modes of demonstra- 
tion, such sorts of appeal to initiative, such methods of 
| practice, and such means of preventing exceptions as 
seem theoretically sound and have been found to be most 
practicable. 
i 6. Summary. —It has been found practicable to in- 
clude applications with each point and to treat the special 
difficulties in special chapters. Four topics remain: — 
(a) It is seldom possible to establish a habit in a single 
lesson. One or more lesson periods may be necessary for 
j any phase or complex of phases. 
{ (b) A criterion for experience is needed. The experi- 
ences of successful teachers are always helpful, but their 
procedure is so often conflicting that some systematic 
and theoretically sound scheme of teaching must be con- 
sulted, if judgment is to be made between them. It is 
i not denied, however, that there may be more than one 
{ correct method, nor is it asserted that every good teacher 
; intentionally follows any such scheme. It ts asserted 
that the requirements of habit-forming must be fulfilled 
consciously or unconsciously, or else the results are only 
apparent. 
(c) Over-habituation, more properly mal-habituation 
or under-accommodation, is the loss of ability to make new

adjustijents. Lack of variety in one’s occupations or his 
avocations tends to bring about this misfortune, which is 
rarely escaped in old age. The exceptions, however, 
seem to indicate the possibility of escape. On a smaller 
scale many in the most favored surroundings condemn 
themselves to ignorance or inaction of one sort or another, 
until a daily routine secures a firm hold upon them. 
(d) There is need of the scientific study of individual 
school habits with due reference to theimportant considera- 
tions in the methodology of habit. No such study has 
been made. Here is a field both for experimental peda- 
gogy and for experimental psychology. But neither can 
profitably investigate in these directions and ignore the 
main divisions. of the habit-forming process.
-P-A-G-E-295
APPENDIX 
Severan years ago the application of the so-called “formal 
steps” in the planning and criticism of lessons was considered 
highly important. Many, if not most, normal and training schools 
' arranged all of their work as far as they could to conform with 
these steps in the process of teaching. The movement did not 
_ last, however, because the scheme was impossible on the one 
hand, and too formal on the other. It was impossible, because 
it was supposed to cover all teaching, regardless of the fact that 
ideas and habits do not fit in the same mold. It was too formal 
in that it failed entirely to recognize the place of the automatic 
as a disturbing and modifying factor in the process of instruction. 
Nevertheless, the scheme had a permanent influence, since it led 
to careful analysis of teaching as an artistic process, not to be 
trusted to chance or blind imitation. : 
The Brooklyn Training School for Teachers has recognized in 
its procedure now for several years a comprehensive method-form, 
embracing both habit and idea. This scheme, indicated by the 
4 observation-form below, has been, with considerable freedom in 
( its interpretation and adaptation, the basis of the definitely planned 
{ work. In the second half of the first year the students are sent

  lesson, and to indicate what phases of the teaching process are 
manifested in the lessons observed, with the following method-

   BIBLIOGRAPHY 
   | Tue literature dealing with habit falls into five classes: the 
philosophical discussions, the brief sections in general text-books 
| on psychology, investigations or observations of habit-formation 
in children or in animals, experimental study of the effects of 
i practice and attention under various conditions, and pedagogical

The Lighting of Schoolrooms 
A Manual for School Boards, Architects, Superintendents,

«“, , . No superintendent, principal, teacher, or architect should fail to 
read this book. . . ; it is a handbook that every member of a board of 
education that belongs to the building committee should not only read, 
but carry around in his pocket to study. The author has rendered a real 
helpful service in preparing this volume in the interest of the children now 
in school, and of future generations. It heads the list, and it will not be 
improved upon in many a year.” — Educational Review. 
“, .. It is the broad purpose of this handy little volume to present the 
principles on which the lighting of a school-building depends. ... The 
book is preéminently a valuable guide not merely to school boards, super- 
intendents, inspectors, and architects, but also to teachers, upon whose 
shoulders falls the responsibility of guarding carefully the health of the 
young children under their care. . . .”” — School Journal, 
“... A valuable contribution to the subject of schoolroom lighting. 
... The subject is treated, not only from the architect’s point of view, 
but also from the standpoint of the officer’s and the teacher’s duty in attain- 
ing desired results, While the book aims to be a manual only, it covers in 
a most compact and yet complete form all that should and can profitably 
be known on the subject.” — School Board Journal, .

THE LIGHTING OF SCHOOLROOMS — Continued 
  
“... It is complete, reliable, and usable by any maker of. school- 
houses. It is a good protection for school boards against incompetent or 
cranky architects.” —/ournal of Education. 
“,.. For the guidance of school boards, architects, superintendents, 
and teachers a very useful manual. . .. The book is carefully indexed; 
a bibliography of some twenty-five works dealing with school architecture, 
hygiene, and sanitation is appended, and also a list of the various kinds of 
window material, with the name and address of the manufacturers. There 
are numerous illustrations from photographs and drawings.” — The 
Churchman. 
+ + Should be read by all who have the construction and planning of 
schoolrooms. The numerous good plans and illustrations give a clear 
idea not only of model buildings, but of methods, such as the use of prism 
glass, by which the disadvantages of poor location can be remedied.” — 
The Independent.

“The volume should find a place in the library of every teacher, and is 
so sensible, so clear, and so succinct that even the parent whose children 
are a disagreeable interruption to the business or pleasure of life will be 
tempted to read it, and having once read it, can scarcely be so fatuous as 
to return to his former attitude of self-complacent carelessness,” — Mew

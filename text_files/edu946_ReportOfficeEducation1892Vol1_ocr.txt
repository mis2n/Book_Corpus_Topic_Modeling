1892-93, as given in Chapter I, was 15,083,630, or 22.5 of the popula- 
tion. The increase over the preceding year was 370,697. 
This summary does not include, however, large numbers of pupils in 
attendance upon various special, but less formal, educational agencies, 
such as evening schools, conservatories of music, schools of art and elo- 
cution, business colleges, trade schools, etc. These if included would 
swell the total to about 15,400,000 persons who attended a school of 
some kind during a longer or shorter period of the school year. 
The great majority of pupils, 96.2 per cent of the whole, were in the 
elementary grades, receiving instruction such as is given in primary 
and grammar schools, which usually embrace the first eight grades in 
a fully graded system. Only 410,420, or 2.7 per cent of the whole, 
were under secondary instruction in public high schools, private acade- 
mies, preparatory schools, and corresponding institutions, doing work 
covering the third four years of a graded course of study. All beyond 
this is embraced under the general term of higher instruction, under 
which were 154,989 students, or 1.1 per cent of the total number. 
Only 1 pupil in 37 was of the secondary grade, and 1 in 94 under 
higher instruction. 
    
THE COMMON SCHOOLS. 
The statistics of the different State common school systems, com- 
piled from information furnished by the State school superintendents, 
are given in detail, pp. 23-38. The common schools are understood in 
this report to include all elementary and secondary public day schools.

  2 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
The whole number of pupils enrolled in the common schools during 
the school year was 13,510,719. Of these, there was an average of 
8,855,717 in attendance daily. 
The enrollment increased 1.92 per cent over the preceding year, 
while the average attendance increased 3.45 per cent. 
The fact that the average attendance increased at a greater rate than 
the enrollment indicates a somewhat increased regularity of attend- 
ance. An average of 655 per cent of all the pupils enrolled during 
the school year were present each day, as compared with 644 per cent 
the preceding year, and 624 per cent in 1879-80. Of the 136.7 days 
during which the schools were in session in 1892 each pupil enrolled 
attended on an average only 89.6 days. These facts indicate the great 
extent to which children in the United States leave school during the 
year to engage in labor or from other motives, particularly in large com- 
mercial and manufacturing centers and in rural districts, and empha- 
size a distinguishing feature of our schools as compared with those of 
Germany or France; in these countries all children of a prescribed age 
are required to attend school the entire school term, and official statis- 
tics would seem to show that the requirement is enforced. 
The school term.—The schools were kept on an average 136.7 days, 
being about the same as the preceding year, and an increase of 6. 
days since 18890. 
This period is equal to twenty-seven weeks of five school days each, 
or alittle more than half the number of such weeks in a year, the maxi- 
mum number of weeks desirable in the school year being forty, with 
egate of two hundred days. 
-e were considerable variations in the different parts of the coun- 
from the average school term, both now and in 1880, as the follow- 
ing table will show:

Teachers.—There were employed in the schools 583,010 teachers, of 
whom 122,056 were men and 260,954 were women. 
The increase in the number of male teachers was 483, about one-half 
of 1 per cent; in that of female teachers it was 8,301, or more than 
3 per cent. The percentage of male teachers accordingly decreased 
from 32.5 to 31.9. 
There are fewer male teachers now than in 1880, while the female 
teachers have increased about 70 per cent in number since that date. 
School property—The number of schoolhouses in 1893 was 2: 
valued, with their grounds, libraries, and apparatus, at $398,435,039.    
 
-P-A-G-E-13
  
        SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 3   
The increase in value was over $15,000,000, or about 4 per cent, show- 
ing that the liberal expenditure for school buildings of the past decade 
continues uninterruptedly. The value of public school property has in 
fact doubled in the last twenty years. The average value of school 
buildings has risen during the past year from $1,679 to $1,692. 
Finances.—Of the $165,000,000 of school revenue received in 1892-93, 
$34,000,000 were derived from State taxes and $108,000,000 from local 
taxes; the income of permanent school funds furnished $9,000,000 more, 
and the balance, $14,000,000, came from various miscellaneous sources. 
State taxation furnished $3,750,000 more than in 1891-92, an increase 
of about 124 per cent, or one-eighth. Three millions of this increase 
are credited to Pennsylvania. Local taxation increased $2,750,000, or 
less than 3 per cent. The total increase was nearly $8,000,000, or an 
amount nearly equal to the income from permanent school funds. 
Of the total common school revenue, one-fifth comes from State taxes 
and two-thirds from local taxes. The income from permanent school 
funds amounts to only about one-twentieth of the total school revenues. 
The total expenditure for school purposes was $163,000,000. Of this 
sum, $104,000,000, or 64 per cent, were paid for teachers’ wages; 
$31,000,000, or 19 per cent, for schoolhouses; and $28,000,000 for fuel, 
supplies, and incidental purposes. 
It is not generally realized to what extent the expenditure of money 
for common schools has increased in recent years; the increase has far 
outstripped the gain in population, as will appear from the following 
table:

  Since 1880 the common school expenditure of the United States 
has been more than doubled, having increased from $78,000,000 to 
$163,000,000. 
SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
  The usual statistical summaries of public and private secondary 
schools are given in Chapter I, pp. 51-69. For the year ending June 
30, 1893, the number of public high schools reporting to the Bureau 
was 2,812. In these schools 9,489 teachers were employed, and the 
number of pupils was 232,951. Reports were received from 1,434 
private high schools and academies employing 6,261 teachers and 
giving instruction to 96,147 pupils. The summaries show for each 
State the number of high schools, the number of teachers and pupils,

the number preparing for college, and the number of students pursu- 
ing each of the nine leading high school studies. In this annual report 
larger space is devoted to secondary schools than to the statistics of 
all the other educational institutions combined, as will be seen by 
reference to the detailed tables. 
HIGHER EDUCATION, 
   Universities and colleges (pp. 69-88).—Of the 451 universities and 
colleges for men and for both sexes, 310 are coeducational, an increase 
of more than 3 per cent in two years. The total number of instructors 
reported by the 451 institutions was 10,247. Of this number, 5,679 
were engaged in regular ollegiate departments, the remainder being 
in preparatory, professional, and special departments. The students 
reported were as follows: Preparatory, 44,054; collegiate, 53; resi- 
dent graduates, 2,625; nonresident graduates, 940; professional, 19,385; 
total in all departments, 140,053. Of the total number, 23.5 per cent 
were women and 5.6 per cent were colored. The graduate students 
have increased from 200 in 1872 to 3,565 in 1892-93. 
The property of these institutions is as follows: Volumes in libraries, 
5,319,602; value of material equipment, $109,078,100; productive funds, 
$94,500,758. The benefactions amounted to $6,532, 
income was $14,601,034. 
Among the important events of the year were the affiliation of the 
Teachers’ College, New York City, with Columbia College, the estab- 
lishment of a school of pure science by the latter, and the opening, to 
a limited extent, of Brown and Yale universities to women. 
Colleges for women.—The 143 colleges for women reporting to this 
office had, in 1892-93, 2,114 instructors and 22,949 students. The mate- 
rial equipment was valued at $13,794,701, and the endowment funds 
at $3,594,947, The income was $3,070,516, and the benefactions 
amounted to $182,981. New institutions. for women have been estab- 
lished at Marietta, Ohio, and Lynchburg, Va. 
Colleges of agriculture and the mechanic arts.—These institutions owe 
their origin to an act of Congress of July 2, 1862, granting land for the 
endowment of colleges of agriculture and the mechanic arts. Under 
said act the General Government has granted 10,400,000 acres of land 
from which an income of $632,677.80 was derived in 1892-93. Under 
the act of Congress of August 30, 1890, these institutions have received 
to June 30, 1893, a total of $3,010,000. The State appropriations for 
these schools amounted to $1,634,715.18 for the year 1892-93. 
Pecuniary aid for college students—Chapter V of Part III contains 
a compilation of the number of scholarships and fellowships offered by 
the several universities and colleges of the United States, England, 
France, and Germany, together with the value and conditions attached 
to the foundations so far as given by the institutions concerned.     
         
      
-P-A-G-E-15
ILLITERACY. 5 
Professional education.—The whole number of medical students was 
19,752—regular, 16,130; homeopathic, 1,445; eclectic, 773; graduate, etc., 
1,404. The number graduating was 4,911, about 25 per cent; dental 
students numbered 2,852; pharmac , 3,394, 
The number of law students has increased very rapidly during the 
last five years—3,906, 4,518, 5,252, 6,073, 6,776. 
Theological students numbered 7,836. One-half of them get their 
sgiate training in denominational schools, one-sixth in nonsectarian 
shools, and only 3 per cent in State universities. 
If we consider the number of students in attendance and the neces- 
sary current expenses, theological schools are more heavily endowed 
than any other class of institutions. Two of them have endowments of 
over $1,000,000, while ten others have about half a million each. 
Summaries of the statistics of normal schools are given on pp. 102-112. 
In 121 public normal schools there were 1,301 teachers and 28,983 stu- 
dents. The number of graduates reported was 4,491. In 31 private 
normals 268 teachers, 7,686 students, and 552 graduates were reported. 
Students pursuing pedagogical or teachers’ courses in 708 universities, 
colleges, high schools, and academies are reported to the number of 
16,796. Thus it will be seen that the number of students in 1893 in 
teachers’ training courses in the various institutions was 53,465. 
In the same connection a table is given indicating the growth of nor- 
mal schools for the past five years. It shows, by States, the amounts 
of money appropriated by State, county, or municipal corporations each 
year from 1888 to 1893 for the support of normal schools and for normal 
school building In 1893 the amount thus appropriated for support 
was $1,452,914 and for buildings $816,826. 
ILLITERACY. 
Chapter II is a presentation of the statistics of illiteracy in the 
United States for 1890, 1880, and 1870, based upon the census reports 
of those years. The number of illiterates (persons 10 years of age and 
over unable to read), the population 10 years of age and over, and the 
per cent of illiterates, by States, will be seen by reference to the first 
seven tables in the chapter, the figures relating to each class for the 
three decades being placed in parallel columns on the same page. 
By this arrangement the progress of the white and the colored, the 
native white and foreign white population, from 1870 to 1890, can be 
more easily reviewed. 
In 1870 the per cent of illiterates to the total population 10 years of 
age and over was 20; in 1880 the rate was 17, and in 1890 the per cent 
had fallen to 1: 
The per cent of illiteracy of the native white population in 1870 was 
10.8; in 1880 it was 8.7, and in 1890 the per cent was 6.2. In 1870 the 
per cent of illiteracy of the foreign-born white population was 14.4; 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
6 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
and in 1880 the rate was 12, while the tables show that in 1890 the per- 
centage had risen to 13.1. 
The table relating to the illiteracy of the colored population tells a 
still more encouraging story. In 1870 the rate of illiteracy of the colored 
population 10 years of age and over was 79.9; in 1880 it was 70, and in 
1890 it had fallen to 56.8, 
The following table shows, in a condensed form, the percentages of 
illiteracy for the total population, male, female, native white, foreign 
white, total white, and colored, for 1890, 1880, and 1870, in each of the 
five divisions of the United States

The remaining tables in the chapter are easily understood. The 
rank of each State in respect to illiteracy is given and the several 
classes of population are treated separately, showing the relative prog. 
ress of each. A chart shows the comparative density of illiteracy in 
the several States, and several diagrams illustrate the salient facts 
extracted from the statistical tables. 
This is followed by a synoptical table of illiteracy in Europe, com- 
piled from official returns, Hiibnev’s statistics, and other sources. This 
table contains the latest available statements, and will therefore be 
very acceptable. The states of Germany in particular make a good 
showing, in that; there are states in which not a single army recruit 
is found to be illiterate, while the total ratio of illiteracy in the Empire 
is less than 1 per cent. 
EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 
Belgium.—Chapter III presents a survey of the educational system 
of Belgium as developed in the organic laws and official reports. 
The system of Belgium resembles in its general form that of France, 
but is totally different in spirit. Local freedom is not more marked 
even in English policies, and advantage has been taken of this prin- 
ciple by opposing parties to carry out widely different conceptions of 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
  EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. . 
popular education. The changes effected in the elementary school 
system under successive laws (i. e., 1842, 1879, and 1884) are traced in 
the chapter, and the present condition of the schools set forth as shown 
by recent statistics. 
Of the changes noted the most suggestive is the reaction from a 
uniform system of public secular schools established by the Liberals 
in 1879 to the mixed public and parochial school system under the 
Clerical party, which came into power in 1884. 
In the department of secondary instruction (enseignement moyen) 
the same questions have arisen as in the United States. Belgium has 
had less difficulty in securing recognition for the new studies than 
neighboring countries, but this fact has not solved the problem of the 
correlation of studies nor of overcrowded programmes. 
As regards superior instruction, the union of special technical schools 
with the four traditional faculties is noticeable in the case, both of the 
two State and the two private universities. The latter comprise alittle 
more than half the university students, i. e., 3,463 out of a total of 5,634. 
The departure made in 1876, when the universities were authorized to 
confer degrees, a function hitherto restricted to a special jury, is con- 
firmed by the law of 1890, which is discussed in the chapter. <A brief 
survey is also presented of industrial and technical schools, for which 
Belgium is justly noted. 
Great Britain.—Chapter IV deals with the state-aided elementary 
school systems (English and Scotch) of Great Britain. From an exam- 
ination of the statistics presented it appears that the effect of the law 
for the remission of school fees has been to increase both the amount 
and the regularity of school attendance. In England the enrollment 
for 1893 shows an increase of about 3 per cent over that for 1892 in the 
case of children under 7 years of age, and of 24 per cent in the case of 
older children. The increase of deposits in the school savings banks is 
interpreted as a disposition on the part of parents to invest the small 
sums (from 2d. to 6d. per pupil) hitherto paid in weekly tuition fees. 
Among notable evidences of progress in popular education are the 
recent acts providing for the education of deaf and dumb and blind 
children, the act raising the minimum age for exemption (either partial 
or total) from school attendance in England from 10 to 11 years, and 
the new regulations for evening schools. These are now virtually 
transformed from elementary schools to “continuation” schools; that 
is, schools affording young men and women of the working classes the 
chance to push the fundamental studies beyond the elementary stage, 
and to pursue special branches which may be helpful to them in busi- 
ness careers. 
A detailed account is given in this chapter of the agitation of the 
subject of religious instruction in the London school board. Some 
excitement prevailed when the board issued a special cireular for the 
guidance of teachers in respect to the use of the board syHabus of  
-P-A-G-E-18
  
  8 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, 
religious instruction. The spirit of the document is indicated by the 
statement as to the “principles” of the Christian religion which the 
teachers should inculcate. “These principles,” says the circular, 
“include a belief in God the Father as our Creator, in God the Son as 
our Redeemer, and in God the Holy Ghost as our Sanctifier. The 
board can not approve of any teaching which denies either the Divine 
or the human nature of the Lord Jesus Christ, or which leaves on the 
minds of the children any other impressions than that they are bound 
to trust and serve Him as their God and Lord.” The document was 
regarded as a religious test, and as such was vehemently opposed by 
secular associations, by nonconformists of all denominations, and by 
the great body of the teachers. The results of the school board elec- 
tion just closed,’ as this matter goes to press, have changed somewhat 
the aspect of the question. The opposition party polled a majority of 
nearly 150,000 votes as against the party favoring the policy indicated 
by the special circular, but owing to the operations of the “cumulative 
vote” the latter have a majority of 3 in the board. This is a reduc- 
tion of 12 below their majority in the former board. The result is 
regarded as a clear indication that the electors are opposed to any 
disturbance of the settlement of the religious question by the act 
of 1870. 
Recent measures affecting secondary education in England, as noted 
in the chapter, are the conference on the subject held at Oxford Uni- 
versity in October, 1893, and the appointment of a royal commission to 
investigate and report upon the present condition of this important 
department of education with a view to needed reforms in organization 
and improved curricula. 
France.—A brief outline of the French educational system is given in 
Chapter V, together with the latest official statistics and a résumé of 
recent measures affecting secondary schools and university faculties. 
The enrollment in elementary schools (exclusive of infant schools) in 
1891-92 was 5,556,470, or 14.5 per cent of the population. The enroll- 
ment exceeded the total number of children of the obligatory school 
ages (6 to 13), who form 12.1 per cent of the population. This ratio is 
less than the corresponding ratio for many countries. In England and 
Scotland, for example, the children 6 to 13 years of age form about 16 
per cent of the population. The enrollment for those ages in England 
is relatively smaller than in France, being 13.7 per cent of the popula- 
tion, but in Scotland the corresponding enrollment rises to 15 per cent 
of the population. 
If the total enrollment in infant schools and classes be included, the 
ratio to total population rises to 16.4 per cent for France, and to 17 and 
164 per cent for England and Scotland, respectively. 
M. E. Levasseur, the distinguished statistician, to whom this office 
is indebted for advance proofs of the “Statistique de ’enseignement 
1 The triennial election occurred in November, 1894,
-P-A-G-E-19
  EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES, 9 
primaire” for 1891-92, notes that the enrollment in primary schools for 
that year is 37,413 less than for the previous year. The decrease in 
the enrollment since 1888-89 is about the same as that in the number 
of births. 
The statistics of university faculties (or separate universities) indi- 
cate the gradual development of the provincial groups. Whereas so 
late as 1887-88 the Paris faculties comprised more than half the total 
number of university students, in 1893 the enrollment in the provincial 
faculties exceeded that of Paris by 3,177. 
The reports of the two French commissions appointed to develop 
plans for the reorganization of medical studies and the institution of 
a special course of preparatory scientific study for medical students, 
together with the decrees giving effect to the recommendations of the 
commissions, are considered in detail in this chapter. F 
British colonies.—The systems of education developed in the British 
colonies have a special interest for citizens of the United States. In 
the system of Ontario, which is described in Chapter: VI, local inde- 
pendence has been happily combined with a degree of centralization 
sufficient to insure economy of means and equality of conditions. The 
principal features of this system as set forth ina recent monograph by 
Mr. John Miller, deputy superintendent of education, are presented, and 
also a survey of the practical workings of the system by Hon. George 
W. Ross, the minister of education. 
The chapter also contains a brief account of the organization and 
present status of the universities and technical schools of New Zealand, 
for which the office is indebted to an esteemed correspondent, Mr. Mark 
Cohen, editor of the Dunedin Evening Star, and further an exposition 
of the conditions of popular education in India, supplemented by a 
paper on educational journalism in India, by Thomas Denham, M. A., 
of Madras, who writes from intimate personal knowledge of the subject. 
Germany.—Chapter VII contains an account of the recent develop- 
ments in the teaching of geography in central Europe; it seems very 
desirable to enter into the history of certain leading branches of study 
so as to gain an insight into the development of the methods of teach- 
ing. The present historical sketch is full of interest for teachers as 
well as professional geographers. Prof. John Goodison, of Ypsilanti, 
recently deceased, has furnished some descriptions of methods applied 
in Europe. 
A teacher in Munich, Mr. Lorenz Reiser, contributes (Chapter VIII) 
a brief statement of the common school system of Bavaria, some fea- 
tures of which commend themselves to the attention of American educa- 
tors. Several contributions to this report touch upon Germany and 
the German-speaking states in central Europe, and will attract the 
reader’s attention on account of the high reputation German pedagogy 
has long borne and still retains for efficient methods.

  10 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Russia.—The subject of education in Russia was presented in extenso 
in my report for 1890-91 (pp. 194-262). 
The current of operations in that country indicates continual effort 
to more thoroughly assimilate the border provinces (so as to inerease 
the home influence in the faculties of the universities and schools on 
the western border) and to cultivate a distinct national spirit, to further 
develop the village industries, and to extend the facilities for indus- 
trial and higher education of women. 
The Russian exhibit at Chicago gave opportunity for a study of insti- 
tutions not previously reported, the exhibit from the ministry of public 
instruction, the Pedagogical Museum, and the Empress Marie institu- 
tions being especially noteworthy. 
Higher education of women in Russia.—Prince Serge Wolkonsky, del- 
* egate from the ministry of public instruction in Russia to the Colum- 
bian Exposition, presents (Chapter VIII of Part IZ) an exposé of the 
educational facilities given to girls in Russia, many of the institutions 
being under imperial patronage, and the object being to train the girls 
for family life or for teaching school, as well as industrially, so that 
those who are obliged to may earn a livelihood by the skill of their 
hands. He describes the vicissitudes to which the institutions for the 
higher education of women are subject. The remarkable intellectual 
development in mathematics, science, and literature of some of the 
Russian women may be considered as pointing toward the same desire 
for the broadening of woman’s sphere that is active in the countries of 
western Europe and America. 
Education in Uruguay.—aA. first attempt is made (Chapter IX) to 
present a statement of the system of education in Uruguay. It is 
noteworthy, as in other South American countries, that prominent 
educators have been detailed from Uruguay to make a thorough study 
of the newest methods in pedagogical science in Europe and North 
America. The adaptability of kindergarten work, and of manual 
and physical training, have been taken under special consideration. 
Experiments are in progress with a view to the introduction of kinder- 
gartensin Montevideo. A higher school for agriculture, to train experts, 
has been started. Uruguay declared its independence of Spanish rule 
in 1825, its first publi¢ schools and “junta,” or body of inspectors, date 
from 1827, but the organization of the school system, with a special 
department of public instruction in charge, is accredited to Don Pedro 
Varela (in 1877), who is called by one of his biographers the Horace 
Mann of Uruguay. 
It is the declared intention to have instruction gratuitous through 
all grades, and compulsory between the ages of 6 and 14. The ratio 
of enrollment to population in the elementary grades is 9.25 per cent. 
The cost of education for each pupil enrolled is $12.06; for each pupil 
in average attendance, $16.95, Of the teachers employed, two-thirds 
are reported to be normal graduates, and three-fourths lay teachers,

one-fourth parochial. The Government furnishes books and all neces- 
sary material for school purposes. The minister of public instraction 
has general supervision of the schools, with a national and a technical 
inspector and five other officials to aid him in the department of public 
instruction at Montevideo. 
Child study.—The chapter on child study (Chapter X) inserted in 
this report will be found to contain instructive contributions from the 
leading American representatives of this modern movement. While 
in the Old World few other than university professors have made 
attempts at a systematic study of this kind, in this country it has 
enlisted teachers of all classes, and both the professional and other 
journals to its aid. To Dr. G. Stanley Hall, president of Clark Uni- 
versity (Worcester, Mass.), is due the credit of inaugurating this vala- 
able movement. 
Bibliography.—The recent popularity of Herbart’s pedagogy and 
philosophy have made a bibliography (Chapter XI) of Herbartian liter- 
ature desirable. In Chapter X is printed also such a bibliography of 
child study, compiled in this Bureau. 
Foreign statistics.—The table of statistics of elementary schools in 
foreign countries printed in my report for 1890-91 is again inserted with 
valuable additiens based upon the latest official returns. 
EDUCATION AT THE WORLD’S COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 
Part II is devoted entirely to reports which were called forth on the 
oceasion of the World’s Fair. It opens with the programme of the 
International Corgress of Education. Then follows a symposium of 
American views and comments on the educational exhibits at Chicago, 
In the third chapter of this part are collected the criticisms on Amer- 
ican education advanced by representatives of the German Government 
at Chicago. They will be read with great interest because of the 
authoritative character of the writers. 
In Chapter IV will be found the substance of two articles upon 
American education and the educational exhibits at Chicago from the 
pen of an educational expezt of international reputation, M. Jules 
Steeg, director of the Musée Pédagogique, Paris. His comments and 
criticisms upon our schools were inspired by actual observation of their 
daily exercises as well as by their exhibits. 
The chapter contains extracts also from reports by M. Jules Violle, 
commissioned to study the state and tendencies of sciencein the United 
States, and by M. Henri Le Soudier on the exhibits of publishers and 
booksellers. Thelatter is particularly full with respect to these indus- 
tries in the United States and Germany. 
In Chapter V will be found a survey of medical instruction in the 
United States as presented in the reports of two French commissioners 
appointed to make a special study of the subject. One of these reports 
was prepared by Dr. Bonet-Maury, member of the general coundil of  
-P-A-G-E-22
    i REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
the Paris faculties, who confined: himself to an investigation of the 
entrance requirements of the chiet medical schools and to a compari- 
son of the same with the preparation for professional study as required 
in France. 
The second report, which is much more extensive, was prepared by 
Dr. Marcel Baudouin and M. R. Mathieu, appointed by the French Gov- 
ernment as commissioners to the Chicago Exposition, the former charged 
also with the special investigation of medical schools and the status of 
medical instruction in the United States. The result of these investi- 
gations is a quarto of 368 pages, which is claimed by Dr. Baudouin to 
be the most comprehensive work on the subject that has yet appeared, 
not excepting even reports by Americans themselves. The first part of 
the report treats in detail of the scientific institutions of the Govern- , 
ment at Washington, schools of medicine, departments of biology and 
hospitals. It deals also with groups of institutions and with social 
“customs, especially such as affect health and sanitation. The second 
part of Dr. Baudouin’s report comprises a general survey of the condi- 
tions, standards, and results of medical instruction in the United States, 
which is reproduced substantially in the chapter. Particularly sug- 
gestive is the discussion of the réle of women physicians. It should be 
mentioned that the appendixes to the report comprise a tabular view of 
the laws regulating medical practice in the United States, a complete 
list of the medical schools existing in 1893, and a very full description 
of the exhibitions of surgical instruments and apparatus for physiolog- 
ical and anthropological laboratories displayed at Chicago from all 
countries. For obvious reasons these bave not been reproduced in this 
chapter. 
Chapter VI consists of notes and observations by the Italian, Swed- 
ish, Danish, and Russian delegates. Signor Luigi Bodio, the director 
of the royal statistical bureau of Italy and one of the most eminent 
statisticians of the world, records in a generous manner his recognition 
of the end and aim of the methods of such of our educational devices 
as come under his inspection. 
Prof. A. Ghisleri makes a careful study of the school furniture and 
apparatus, and a comparison of the methods that he observed in the 
New York City schools with the methods of his own country, Italy. 
Dr. Osterberg, of Sweden, Miss Frederiksen, of Denmark, and M. 
Kovaleski, the delegate from the Russian ministry of instruction, make 
interesting comparative studies of our educational exhibits. 
Another chapter (Chapter VII) contains an English version of a 
report on American technological schools made by Professor Riedler 
of the Royal Polytechnicum at Charlottenberg, near Berlin. This 
report is copiously illustrated, showing the courses of study of this 
kind of schools in a very novel manner. The author offers some 
standards of measurement hitherto not applied, and the graphic pre- 
sentation of the courses of study facilitate their application.

THE COMMITTEE OF TEN. 13 
In Chapter VIII of this part of the report I have printed a report 
of the proceedings of the World’s Congress of Librarians held at Chi- 
cago during the Exposition. Under the presidency of the Hon. Melvil 
Dewey, the able secretary of the State board of regents of New York, 
a remarkable series of articles was prepared, all of them relating to 
library economy. In the interest of the librarians of the 4,000 public 
libraries in the United States I have obtained a complete set of these 
papers and offer the same in this report. I am sure that these valuable 
papers will be appreciated not only by those immediately connected 
with libraries but by all intelligent persons interested in libraries, 
  In the third part of this report Prof. B. A. Hinsdale, of the Univer- 
sity of Michigan, contributes a chapter of “Documents illustrative of 
American educational history” (Chapter I). This will be of particular 
interest, because it gives some of the important school legislation of 
the colonial period; but no attempt has been made to gather all the 
acts of the colonial legislatures on this subject, nor is it claimed that 
the laws quoted stand for more territory than the colonies by which 
they were passed. This paper also gives with considerable detail the 
history of the Congressional grants of land and money for common 
schools, universities, and agricultural colleges. It traces the agitation 
for and the struggle in behalf of the bill establishing this Bureau and 
presents the views of many statesmen and scholars on the establish- 
ment of a national university—a question whose interest begins with 
Washington and the founding of the National Government, and is 
to-day attracting attention from statesmen and educators. The last 
section of the paper is a compilation of the provisions of all the State 
constitutions relating to education from 1776 to the present time. It is 
believed to be complete, is divided into periods, and is of value not 
only as a matter of reference, but also as a means of comparative study, 
for by it the remarkable growth of the estimate set on education, as 
seen in the organic laws of the several States, can be distinctly traced. 
Chapter II treats of the report of the committee of ten appointed by 
the National Educational Association to take up the important subject 
of courses of instruction in the secondary schools. Not only is there 
great confusion in the existing curricula, but actual waste of the time 
and energy of students, not because of poor teaching—for the teachers 
of secondary schools are on the whole the most skillful of all—but 
because of defective courses of study. The first step toward the much 
needed reform in these particulars was a conference between leading 
representatives of secondary education in different sections of the 
country, including specialists in the several branches of study to be 
considered. Such a conference was secured through the action of the 
National Educational Association, which appointed a committee under 
the chairmanship of Dr. Eliot, president of Harvard University, and 
appropriated $2,500 for its expenses. Nine subcommittees were 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
14 REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
appointed upon whose expert opinions touching the various phases of 
secondary instruction the final report of the committee was based. 
Thirty thousand copies of this report were printed and distributed by 
this Bureau under your authority. 
The report of the committee is reprinted in this chapter together 
with several reviews of the same. These have been selected as typical 
at once of the lines along which the report has been most sharply eriti- 
cised and those on which it is most generally indorsed. The review by 
Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler emphasises the weak points of our 
secondary school work, i. e., the unorganized, sporadic character of the 
courses in modern languages and natural sciences, weaknesses that are 
reflected even in the committee’s model programme. His analysis of 
the programmes brings into clear view the simultaneous arrangements 
which permit students in different courses to be united in many sub- 
jects. 
Dr. Eliot’s article on the unity of educational reform sets forth the 
elements that are common to all educational work, and shows the 
bearing of the report of the committee upon this integral process. 
In my address before the department of superintendents at Rich- 
mond, I claimed for the high school course, as laid out by the school 
authorities of the cities of the country, that it is more rational than 
the secondary course of the private preparatory schools prescribed for 
them by the colleges, because it opens the mind to all the phases of 
human learning presented by nature and humanity. The problem of 
secondary instruction involves a thorough inquiry into the relative 
educational values of different branches. In his history ofthe work of 
the committee Dr. Baker has ably defended this position. He takes 
exception to the report as favoring “an extreme theory of equivalence 
of studies.” The importance of this central problem is reinforced by 
Principal O. D. Robinson in view of the fact that 90 per cent of high 
school pupils do not enter college. 
Superintendent Nightingale has confined himself chiefly to the results 
of the special conference on English. Of all the studies discussed this 
suffers most from the want of systematized instruction, and further 
from its unsatisfactory treatment in college entrance examinations. 
Hence a reason for special attention to this subcommittee report. 
The chapter concludes with a bibliography of the report of the com- 
mittee, which is substantially complete up to the time that this goes 
to press. 
Chapter ITI contains a historical account of the National Educa- 
tional Association, followed by a statement of the organization and 
functions of this powerful educational agency; its constitution is quoted, 
and a list of its annual meetings with the name of its officers is given, 
as well as a catalogue of the papers and addresses delivered since its 
organization in 1869. It is a fortunate cireumstance that the first 
president of the association, Mr. Z. Richards, could undertake a sketch 
   
-P-A-G-E-25
  EDUCATION OF THE NEGRO. 15 
of its historical development. He has with singular faithfulness fol- 
lowed the growth of this worthy institution. The lists of principal 
subjects considered is complete; a search through it reveals a wealth 
of educational ideas and suggestions. 
The third part of the report also contains an article on “The educa- 
tion of the negro, its characteristics and facilities,” contributed by Mr. 
Welford Addis, who takes the ground that there are three features 
which distinguish the education of the American negro and to a large 
extent differentiate it from that of the white people among whom he 
lives. These facts are, (1) the cost of education of the negro is borne 
by the white portion of the community; (2) this education is almost 
always elementary; (3) it is becoming more industrial in character. 
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant, 
W. T. HARRIS, 
Commissioner.

I.—GENERAL SUMMARY OF PUPILS OF ALL GRADES IN PUBLIC 
AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND INSTITUTIONS. 
The following table gives the number of pupils of all grades in the 
United States,! classified according to grade of instruction imparted, 
instead of according to the character of institution attended. Thus, 
all secondary pupils in colleges have been classed as secondary, and 
all elementary pupils as elementary, even though attending (in the 
“preparatory” department) an institution of secondary grade. 
The statistics of private elementary education have never been com- 
pletely gathered, and the figures.in column 3 are, therefore, largely 
estimated; they are known to be much less than the facts would war- 
rant, and should possibly be increased as much as 50 per cent. The 
returns of pupils receiving secondary instruction, both public and pri- 
vate, are also incomplete. 
The total number of pupils and students of all grades in 1892-93 in 
public and private schools, as given by the table, was 15,083,630, or 
22.5 per cent of the total population. 
The increase over the preceding year was 370,697, or 2.52 per cent. 
About 10 persons in every 44 during the year in question received 
formal instruction of some kind. 
Of the whole number of pupils and students, 96.2 per cent were 
receiving elementary instruction, 2.7 per cent secondary instruction, 
and 1.1 per cent higher instruction. 
  
1 Excluding, in general, evening schools; music, elocution, art, industrial training, 
trades, and private business schools; schools for the defective, dependent, and delin- 
quent classes, and Indian schools. Theso collectively enroll some 300,000 pupils. 
19
-P-A-G-E-30
    20 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Only 1 pupil out of 37 was of secondary (or high school) grade, and 
1 in 94 of collegiate grade. 
As compared with the total population, 1 person in every 161 was a 
secondary pupil and 1 in 413 was under higher instruction. On this 
basis, a city of 10,000 inhabitants would furnish on an average 62 sec- 
ondary pupils and 24 higher students (the latter including professional 
and normal students). 
Of all pupils and students, 90 per cent attended public schools and 
institutions and 10 per cent private. This percentage of private pupils 
is, however, probably too small, as the records of private school attend- 
ance are very incomplete, particularly in the elementary grades.

The enrollment here given is less than that found by adding together columns 2 and 4 in Table 1, 
in that it doce not embrace seconcary pupils in public collegiate institutions. 
SUMMARY. 
The figures for 1892-93 in the following statement are made up from 
returns from the different States for that year, except in a few instances,

    CITY PUBLIC: SCHOOLS. 
IIl.—Criry ScHoou SysrEm. 
Nore.—For statistics of individual cities, see Part IV, Tables 1-3. 
The two facts which are the most striking of those disclosed by the 
statistical summaries of city school systems are, (1) that the average 
length of the school term has still further decreased, and (2) the great 
increase, both relative and absolute, in the cost of the schools. 
The decrease in the length of term is less than that noted last year, 
being only nine-tenths of a day. This difference is but a slight one, 
and may or may not be a further indication of a growing belief that a 
shorter school year is advisable, as was suggested in the last report. 
But if this explanation is not the true one, the difference must be 
ascribed to increasing laxity in the matter of holidays, due to a feeling 
that the closing of the schools occasionally for a day is not a very serious 
matter. This is certainly true of many cases, and there are indications 
that they have been sufficiently numerous to account for the deerease 
that appears in the general average. 
In any case of doubt, the final test of the true meaning of statistical 
changes is to search out the locality from which the differences come 
and investigate the conditions that prevail there. Upon these condi- 
tions must be based any lessons that are to be drawn from the statistics, 
for the tables themselves are merely the dials upon which are shown 
the effects of causes that are in operation behind them. 
Proceeding upon this idea in the present instance, it is discovered 
(see Table 4) that the average length of the school term has decreased 
one day in the North Atlantic Division; 0.44 day in the South Atlantic, 
and 1.3 days in the South Central, and 3 days in the Western. On the 
other hand, there has been an increase of 1.6 days in the North Central 
Division, which counterbalances much of the decrease in the other divis- 
ions, and leaves the loss in the general average at,0.9 of a day. 
On account of its great preponderance in the number of pupils over 
the western and the two southern divisions, it is to the North Atlantic 
Division that we must look for the causes that affect the general aver- 
age most. New York and Massachusetts are the two States which 
have had the greatest influence in the decrease. 
The following shows the length of school year for 1891-92 and 1892-93 
in the cities of New York which had over 25,000 inhabitants in 1890:

  40 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
It appears, therefore, that there were fewer school days in eight cities, 
including the largest in the State; that in four the term was the same 
in both years, and in only one there was an increase. In New York 
City the schools were in session 202.5 days in 1890-91. 
In -Massachusetts the reports of length of term directly show a 
shortening in 13 cities, namely: Amesbury, 10 days; Chicopee, 2 days; 
Clinton, 6 days; Framingham, 2 days; Hyde Park, 10 days; Lawrence, 
1 day; Lowell, 9 days; Medford, 10 days; New Bedford, 7 days; New- 
ton, 9 days; Quincy, 26 days. Eleven cities report a longer term, 
namely: Gloucester, 2 days; Haverhill, 2 days; Holyoke, 4 day; Lynn, 
4 days; Marlboro, 5 days; Melrose, 7 days; Newburyport, 2 days; 
Pittsfield, 5 days; Worcester, 4 days; Woburn, 1 day; North Adams, 
5 days. The remaining 18 cities report the same term in both years, 
or else fail to report the item. a 
The reports to the State superintendent vary in some instances from 
the returns made to this office, and the table below shows the figures 
which appear in the Massachusetts State reports:

    If each of the differences in the fourth column be weighted according 
to the corresponding average attendance, a net loss to all the cities of 
2.15 daysis indicated. But the figures of this office in regard to attend- 
ance indicate a loss of 4.7 days. This is probably the more nearly 
correct, for many superintendents report every year as the length of 
term the number of days which the regulations prescribe, without 
deducting extraordinary holidays. 
The following shows the term of the principal cities in the two south- 
ern and western divisions, in all three of which, as wholes, a reduction 
appears:

  The figures presented tend to show in what way the decreased length 
of term came about. It appears to have been not the result of a well 
considered plan, but of a custom that is becoming only too common, 
of closing the schools for any one of a great variety of reasons. There 
are cases, to be sure, where lack of funds necessitates the premature 
closing of the schools, and there are also other cases in which a long 
school term is shortened from a well-defined belief that such a course 
is best for the pupil. But the small number of days by which the 
decrease comes is against the supposition that either class of causes is 
chiefly responsible for the loss. 
Comparatively few school officers refer to this matter and it is not 
possible to give the precise cause that is operative in any other than 
those few cases. The following, however, are significant:
-P-A-G-E-52
         42 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Mr. Isaac A. Sheppard, president of the board of education of Phila- 
delphia, Pa., says, in his report for 1893: 
Parents have frequently complained that too many holidays are given; and such 
complaints appear to be well founded. Nominally our schools are open ten months 
in the year, for five days per week; but, in fact, the schools are not opened until the 
second week in September, and are closed about a week before the close of June. 
Deducting, moreover, the legal holidays, the Christmas holidays, the Easter holidays, 
and the time lost for rainy days, cold days, hot days, and days when some other 
excuse is found for taking rest, we find that the actual days of school work amount 
to less than nine months, instead of ten. It is true that both teachers and children 
like holidays, and plenty of them, but is it well for the children, is it well for the 
parents, is it well for the taxpayer that valuable time should be thus wasted? I 
believe that the interests of the community would be better served by keeping the 
schools open not less than two hundred days in the year. 
The report of Mr. Gordon A. Southworth, superintendent of schools, 
Somerville, Mass., for the year 1893, contains the following: 
Nominally our school year contains forty weeks. In 1893 the schools were in ses- 
sion thirty-seven weeks lacking a half day. This loss of 74 per cent of the time was 
occasioned as follows: School holidays, twelve half days; stormy weather, eight half 
days; last half week in June, five half days; Thanksgiving recess, three half days; 
Middlesex County Teachers’ Association, two half days; ex-Mayor Pope’s funeral, one 
half day. ‘Total, thirty-one half days. 
A similar condition exists in Wilmington, Del., as is shown by the 
following extract from the report for 1893-94 of Superintendent D. W. 
Harlan: 
One hundred and eighty-nine is somewhat more than the average number of days 
the schools were open. The number of days of school in each school cach month 
can be seen in the tables in the Appendix. Labor day, two days for a teachers’ 
institute, the Friday following Thanksgiving Day, were voted holidays, and by an 
old custom the schools were closed the last Wednesday in June instead of the last 
Friday. The last eight school days of June the grammar and primary schools were 
closed at noon, making only a half day each day, or four days of school in the eight 
days. At examination time, if the teacher of a room has one class under examina- 
tion and the other class is out of school, the day is counted as a day of school in that 
division, but if neither class is in school, there is no school in that division, and the 
reports show there has been no school, or ought to do so. .This only occurs when so 
many examination papers have accumulated in the hands of a teacher that the day 
is needed to mark them.    
  EXPENDITURES. 
A grievous fact in connection with the modern improvements in the 
school system is that they cost money. Handsome buildings, effective 
ventilation, manual training, scientific laboratories, kindergartens, phys- 
ical training, and compulsory attendance are all costly. They require 
not only expenditure for new material appliances, but a greater num- 
ber of teachers, janitors, and other employees, and frequently, much 
higher priced ones. A steady increase is therefore observable in the 
aggregate of expenditures for schools. 
While the enrollment in the cities under consideration increased 4.86 
per cent during the year, the increase in total expense was 8.96 per

From this it appears that in the North Atlantic and North Central 
divisions the increase has been in both the amount paid to teachers 
and in the sums spent for other purposes. In the South Atlantic 
Division more has been spent for tuition, but there has been a saving 
in other respects, so that the whole amount spent was actually less in 
1892-93 thanin 1891-92. In the South Central Division there appears a 
heavier increase in the cost of tuition than in the total expense, show- 
ing that the teachers received the lion’s share of the 12 per cent increase 
in the whole amount spent. In the Western Division, on the contrary, 
the total expenditure shows a heavy increase, while the amount paid to 
teachers has increased at a less rate than theenrollment. In the South 
Atlantic Division there was but a small inerease in enrollment during 
the year—much less than in any other division. This itself would 
explain why the expense should not have increased in the same ratio as 
in the other divisions, but as it happens there was not only no increase 
but an absolute decrease of $62,477.

The expenditures for the two years of the principal cities in this 
division were as follows:

Charle ston, 61, 854 78, 558 
It will be seen that the decrease of the division is due principally to 
the conditions in Baltimore, Washington, and Wilmington. Baltimore 
spent for building $96,000 more in 1892 than in 1893, and $20,000 more 
for current expenses other than teachers’ salaries. In Washington the 
expenditure for sites and buildings was $220,344 in 1891-92, and only 
$42,270 in 1892-93. In Wilmington there was a reduction of $5,000 in 
the amount paid for buildings, and $10,000 in the current expenses. 
In all three cities more was paid to teachers i in the later year than in 
the earlier. 
The unusual increases noted in the North, Central, and Western 
divisions come from unwonted energy in the erection of new buildings. 
Chicago expended $1,370,000 for that purpose during 1892-93, against 
$995,000 in 1891-92, and $749,000 in 1890-91. St. Louis spent $565,000 
last year, and only $109,038 in 1890-91. Omaha, Nebr., invested 
$255,000 in sites and buildings in 1892-93, or over twice as much as 
in the year previous. Salt Lake City, Utah, however, surpasses them 
all, for with a school attendance of less than 6,000, nearly $360,000 was 
expended for permanent improvements, thus more than doubling the 
value of the school property of the city in a single year. 
Expenditures like these are the best possible evidence of the favor 
with which the American people regard the public schools. The com- 
placent attitude of school officers and boards of education toward the 
tendency to heavy expenditures is exemplified in-the following extracts: 
Superintendent A. P. Marble, Worcester, Mass. (Report of the 
Worcester Schools, 1893, p. 28), says: 
The cost per scholar in the day schools has risen from $24.52 last year to $26.28 in 
1893. This increase of $1.76 in the cost per scholar is due partly to changes in the 
course of studies, which require cabinets of specimens in natural history, etc., more 
apparatus and books of reference, and a large amount of supplementary reading; in 
part it is due to the improved means of heating and ventilation, which require much 
more fuel; and in part it is due to the overcrowded condition of some of the school- 
houses, where four teachers are required to do the work which three might do in 
suitable rooms. In the two high schools the cost per pupil has arisen from $47.25 in 
the old and crowded school to $66.90. This increase is due first to the smaller and 
more reasonable number of pupils to a teacher; and secondly, it is due to the exten- 
sive purchase of books and apparatus. The equipment of these schools is now 
elaborate and first class, if not unsurpassed.

CITY PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 45 
Hon. Z. L. White, president of the board of education, Columbus, 
Ohio (Annual Report of the Board of Education of the City of Colum- 
bus, Ohio, for the school year ending August 31, 1893, p. 29), says: 
An article in the Evening Dispatch of recent date charges this board with extray- 
agance, affirming that this is the most expensive branch of the public service, cost- 
ing more to maintain it than it costs to conduct the balance of the city government. 
This proposition is quite new and we think the statement will admit of investiga- 
tion, but, granting that it is true, why should it not be the most expensive? Tho 
education given in our public schools constitutes the capital and the stock in trade 
of three-fourths of our boys and girls, who are thereby equipped for business. 
They in turn become good citizens, help to build up and enrich the city, so the 
grade of seholarship given them should be as high as the city can afford. 
But let us see about this expense. 
The item of tuition costs now only $1.92 per capita more than it did twelve years 
ago, when our teachers were poorly paid, and a lower rate of scholarship given. 
During the transition from 1880 to 1892 there has been a gradual advance in the 
wages of the teachers, and in the course of study, with the very small advance of 
13 per cent in the cost of administration. Is there any extravagance in this? The 
department of penmanship and calisthenics was also added during this period. The 
library building is cited as a monument of our extravagance. The fact is, we have 
here the choicest piece of property owned by the city, the most beautiful front and 
inside finish, and the best adapted to the uses for which it was designed. This depart- 
ment had grown to such proportions that a home, with fire-proof vaults for the 
records, contracts, and valuable papers, with assembly room, committee rooms, offices, 
reference rooms, and library hall was indispensable to the successful management of 
the department. This home, including the lot and the improvements to the build- 
ings, cost $80,000, and because it was built so beautifully and substantially for the 
money, it stands a monument to economy—a credit to the building committee, to this 
board, and to the city.

  SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 51 
IV.—PuBiic High SCHOOLS AND PRIVATE SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
In Part IV of this report, Tables 4 and 5, will be found the names of 
the 2,812 public high (secondary) schools and the 1,434 private second- 
ary schools reporting to this office for the year ending June 30, 1893. 
The post-office address of each school is given, and the name of the 
principal, the two lists being arranged alphabetically by States. In 
the same line with the name of the institution is given the number of 
instructors, the number of secondary students, and the number below 
the secondary grade. The tables also give the number of students in 
each school preparing for college classical and scientific courses, and 
the number of graduates. The number of college preparatory students 
in the class that was graduated in 1893 is also given for each school. 
The number of colored students in public and private secondary schools 
is Shown. Male and female students are numbered in separate columns 
in the detail tables. 
In the following pages are twelve tables in which is summarized by 
States and divisions all the statistics contained in the two detail tables 
in Part IV relating to public and private secondary schools. 
Table 1 shows that in the 2,812 public high ‘schools reporting there 
were 9,489 teachers, 232,951 students in the secondary grades, and 
436,855 pupils below the secondary grades. Of the number in the high 
school grades 3,227 were pupils in colored schools. 
Table 2 gives the number of college preparatory students and the 
number of graduates. In the 2,812 public high schools, 17,572 students 
were preparing for the college classical course and 16,563 were pre- 
paring for college scientific courses. The total number of graduates in 
1893 was 29,410, and of these 8,815 were college preparatory students. 
Tables 3,4, and 5 give the number of students pursuing each of 
the ten leading high school branches. Latin is studied by 100,319 
students, Greek by 7,922, French by 14,959, German by 27,760, alge- 
bra by 123,177, geometry by 60,570, trigonometry by 6,348, physics by 
54,219, chemistry by 23,285, and history by 78,917. 
Table 6 gives the number of volumes in the libraries, the value of 
the equipments, and the income of the public high schools of the coun- 
try. The summary shows that the public high school libraries so far 
as reported contain 1,211,147 volumes. The aggregate value of build- 
ings and grounds was $51,811,044. The schools received State, county, 
and municipal aid to the amount of $5,923,800, and received from tui- 
tion fees, $616,350. The amount received for support from all sources 
was $8,374,104. This total is larger than the sum of the other two 
items and results from the fact that many schools reported only the 
total amounts received from all sources. 
Tables 7, 8,9, 10,11, and 12 give the summaries of statistics for 
private secondary schools, corresponding to the same items in the pre- 
ceding six tables for public secondary schools. These tables are 
   
-P-A-G-E-62
  "52 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
arranged so that they can be easily compared column by column, Table 
1 with Table 7, Table 2 with Table 8, ete. 
In the 1,434 private secondary schools and academies there were 
6,261 teachers, 96,147 secondary students, 64,180 elementary pupils, 
15,009 preparing for college classical courses, 10,476 preparing for col- 
lege scientific courses. There were 8,319 graduates from these private 
high schools. 
Tables 9, 10, and 11 show that the ten principal high school branches 
were pursued by the students as follows: Latin by 37,716 students, 
Greek by 8,278, French 17,756, German 15,025, algebra 41,106, geometry 
19,587, trigonometry 5,539, physics 18,998, chemistry 9,554, and history 
by 31,212 students. 
Table 12 shows that the iibeanies of the private high schools contain 
1,219,118 volumes and that the value of buildings and grounds aggre- 
gates $44,395,941. The amount of income from State and municipal 
appropriations was $201,440; from tuition fees, $4,586,530; from pro- 
ductive funds, $1,545,968, making the total sum for support $6,333,938, 
It should be noted that the information relating to the income of 
both public and private high schools is far from complete. The aggre- 
gate sums given in the two tables for the support of schools, $8,374,104 
for public high Schools and $6,333,938 for private high schools, should 
be much larger. Many schools failed to report on these items and 
others sent incomplete figures. In the city high schools, particularly, 
it was difficult to separate the amounts expended for their support 
from the general school funds. The actual aggregate value of build- 
ings and grounds occupied by secondary schools doubtless exceeds the 
sums given in Tables 6 and 12. 
Table 13 summarizes the statistics of public and private secondary 
schools for the whole country, placing the two classes of institutions in 
parallel columns and giving grand totals. The percentage of male and 
female students to the total number of students in each is shown, as 
well as the percentages in certain studies. To those seeking informa- 
tion in a condensed form relating to secondary schools this table is 
invaluable. 
Tables 14 and 15 have been arranged to show the number of private 
secondary schools controlled or supported by religious denominations. 
From the first column of Table 14 it will be seen that 824 of the 1,434 
private secondary schools are under nonsectarian management. The 
remainder of that table and Table 15 will show that of the remaining 
610 schools 173 are under Roman Catholic control, 90 Episcopal, 68 
Presbyterian, 59 Baptist, 49 Methodist, 45 Congregational, 42 Friends, 
28 Southern Methodists, 23 Lutheran, and 33 under the control of other 
religious denominations. From the tables can also be learned the dis- 
tribution of teachers and students in these denominational schools. 
Of the 96,147 students in private secondary schools, 55,129 are in the 
nonsectarian schools.
-P-A-G-E-63
  SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 53 
Table 16 will in some measure illustrate the growth of public and 
private secondary schools in this country for the past twenty years. 
The figures are taken from the annual reports of the Commissioner of 
Education beginning with 1871 when this Bureau collected the first 
statistics from private high schools and academies. The report of 1876 
contains the first detailed information relating to public high schools 
and the figures were collected exclusively from public high schools in 
the larger cities. It was not till 1889 that an attempt was made to 
collect statistics from all the public high schools of the country. 
In referring to Table 16 it should be noted that the exclusive city 
high school statistics end with the report of 1888-89 and the statistics 
for public high schools in general begin with 1889-90. The lack of 
uniformity in the apparent growth of private secondary schools as dis- 
played in the table should be explained. Where to draw the line 
between secondary and elementary pupils was long a vexed question. 
Perhaps one year all pupils who pursued only one secondary study were 
classed as high school students while the very next year the total would 
be reduced by excluding all who did not pursue at least two secondary 
studies. Perhaps greater effort was made to collect statistics one year 
than was made the next. This may also in a measure account for the 
falling off in the number of students as shown in several of the annual 
reports. Taking these discrepancies into consideration and reviewing 
the whole period from 1871 to 1893 a fairly accurate idea of the relative 
_growth of public and private secondary schools can be gained from an 
inspection of Table 16, The net gain for the private schools has not 
been very large in the twenty-two years, but public high schools have 
had a remarkable growth.

  72 * EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
The foregoing table shows that the proportion of women professors 
and instructors remains low; especially is this true of the college and 
professional departments. The largest proportion of women professors 
is found in the North Central and Western divisions of the country, 
while the smallest proportion is found in the North Atlantic Division. 
Taking the total number of students enrolled in the collegiate and 
graduate departments of the universities and colleges of the entire 
couatry, we find that the neeoo aon of students to instructors is 10.4 
students to 1 instructor. 
In 1890-91 the total number of professors and instructors in all 
departments reported by 430 institutions was 8,472, while in 1892-93 
the number reported, by 451 institutions was 10,247. Among the insti- 
tutions reporting in the latter year and which were not included in 
1890-91 is the University of Chicago, with 135 professors and instructors.

  76 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
The foregoing tables show that the total number of students in 
attendance upon all the courses of the several institutions was 140,053, 
Of this number 23.5 per cent were women, and 5.6 per cent were col- 
ored. In the undergraduate departments there were enrolled 55,553 
students. Women comprised almost 20 per cent of this number, while 
the proportion of colcred students was small; only 1.5 per cent of the 
total number belonging to the colored race. Inthe preparatory depart- 
ments these two classes of students make a much better showing. 
Of the 44,054 students enrolled in the preparatory departments, 30.4 
per cent were women, and 8.2 per cent were colored. It would natu- 
rally be expected that the proportion of colored students would be 
considerably larger in the preparatory departments than in the other 
departments of the several institutions. The professional departments 
claimed 19,385 students, of which number 3.7 per cent were women 
and 3.6 per cent were colored. 
The diagram shown on p. 77 shows the number of students in attend- 
ance on the undergraduate courses of the universities and colleges as 
reported to this office for the years 1885-86 to 1892-93, inclusive. 
The graduate students pursuing advanced liberal studies have been 
classified as resident and nonresident students. The number of resi- 
dent graduates for the year under consideration was 2,625, while the 
number of nonresident graduates was 940. Of the former number, 14.9 
per cent were women, while of the latter number but 10 per cent were 
women. The greatest number of nonresident graduates is found in the 
North Central Division of the country. In this section as well as in 
the North Atlantic Division there are several institutions in which the 
nonresident graduate departments are important features of the insti- 
tutions. 
The growth of graduate work in the United States from 1871-72 to 
1892-93 is set forth in the diagram shown on p. 78. 
In this diagram are included only such graduate students as are pur- 
suing what are generally known as liberal studies, graduate students 
pursuing professional courses of study being excluded.

For a number of years the percentage of students in the classical or

courses leading to the science degrees has been increasing. 
Preparation of students.—Another attempt was made during the year 
to ascertain the kinds of schools in which the several freshmen students

The number of A. B. degrees conferred continues to be considerably 
larger than the number of other first degrees. The number of A. M. 
degrees will undoubtedly continue to grow smaller year by year. This 
is due to the fact that many of the institutions which formerly granted 
the master’s degree in course three years after attaining the bachelor’s 
degree, are withdrawing this privilege, and are requiring one year’s 
resident study, or its equivalent, together with an examination and, in 
some cases,.a thesis. 
The total number of Ph. D. degrees conferred for work done was 189. 
Of this number, 110, or 58.2 per cent, were conferred by the institutions 
in the North Atlantic Division, 16.9 per cent in the South Atlantic Divi- 
sion, 2.7 per cent in the South Central Division, 21.7 per cent in the 
North Central Division, and 0.5 per cent in the Western Division. 
Degrees in pedagogy were conferred in but 6 States in the North 
Central and Western divisions. In many of the institutions offering 
courses in pedagogy or the science and art of teaching, such courses 
are counted towards fulfilling the requirements for degrees in arts and 
science. 
The total number of honorary degrees conferred in 1892-93 was 886. 
Of this number, 396 were A. M., 121 LL. D., and 277 D. D. In all there 
were conferred 458 honorary doctorates, of which number 32 were 
doctors of philosophy. The number of honorary degrees, by States, is 
given in the following table:

UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES. : 87 
The total number of volumes in libraries in 1892-93 was 5,319,602, 
an increase of a little more than 700,000 over the number reported in 
- 1891-92. Besides these bound volumes there were reported 1,148,567 
pamphlets. The North Atlantic Division seems to be especially favored 
in the number of books possessed by its universities and colleges. 
While this division contains but 17.3 per cent of the total number of 
institutions, it has 46.2 per cent of the total number of books reported, 
and 55.6 per cent of the total number of pamphlets. The total amount 
of the value of grounds, buildings, and apparatus, together with the 
amount of invested funds, forms an equipment worth $203,578,858. Of 
this total amount we again find that about 47.2 per cent is possessed 
by the institutions in the North Atlantic Division. 
While the institutions in this division have but 37.9 per cent of the 
total amount of the value of grounds and buildings, they have almost 
50 per cent of the scientific apparatus and 55.9 per cent of the total 
amount of productive funds. These figures are very significant when 
it is remembered how small a proportion of the institutions are located 
in this division. As to the amount of benefactions received during the 
year, the North Central Division has the advantage, having received 
almost 50 per cent of the total amount reported. Of the $3,210,708 
reported by the institutions of this division, the University of Chicago 
reported $1,950,000. 
Income.—The income of universities and colleges is derived from 
tuition fees, from productive funds, State or municipal appropriations, 
appropriations from the General Government and from miscellaneous 
sources. The total income reported by the universities and celleges in 
1892-93 was $14,601,034. Of this amount, $5,466,810, or 37.4 per cent, 
was derived from tuition fees, thus showing the comparatively small 
proportion of the cost of an education that is borne by the students. 
Of the remainder, 34.9 per cent is the income from invested funds; 11.5 
per cent was appropriated by the several States and cities; 4.7 per cent 
was appropriated by the General Government, while the balance was 
received from miscellaneous sources. The following summary gives the 
statistics concerning the income by States:

(See Part IV, Tables 7 and 8, for detailed statistics.)     FOR WOMEN.     The total number of colleges for women reported for the year 1892-93 
was 143. Of this number 16 were placed in a division by themselves 
as representing a class of institutions similar to the coeducational col- 
leges and to the colleges for men. The number of institutions in this 
division was increased over the number in the preceding year by the
-P-A-G-E-99

addition of Rockford College, Rockford, Ik, and the H. Sophie New- 
comb Memorial College, New Orleans, La. During the year informa- 
‘tion was received of the closing of Ingham University, Le Roy, N. Y. 
New institutions that will undoubtedly be classed in this division for 
the year 1893-94 are the Marietta College for Women, at Marietta, 
Ohio, and the Randolph-Macon Woman’s College at Lynchburg, Va. 
The summarized statistics of the 16 institutions, included in Division 
A of the table of colleges for women, are given in the following tables:

As will be seen from these tables, 11 of the 16 institutions are found 
in the North Atlantic Division. The large proportion of these institu- 
tions in this division is due probably to the fact-that in this division 
coeducation of the sexes has made the least progress. In nearly all of 
the Western States the State universities and other leading educa- 
tional institutions have, from the first, been open to women, thus ren- 
dering unnecessary the founding of any large number of institutions 
for the education of women only. 
While the North Atlantic Division has 68.75 per cent of the institu-

were received by institutions in this division. It may be well to state, 
however, that the financial statistics of the Cleveland College for 
Women and of the H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College were not 
reported separately from those of the institutions with which they are 
connected, viz, the Western Reserve University and Tulane University. 
Only 13 of the 16 institutions reported the classification of students 
in degree courses. Of the 2,435 students classified, 62.71 per cent were 
pursuing courses of study leading to the A. B. degree. This propor- 
tion is greater by 7 per cent than the proportion of students in the 
coeducational colleges and colleges for men that pursue courses of study 
leading to the same degree. One reason, if not the principal one, for 
the greater proportion in the colleges for women may be found in the 
fact that in this class of institutions there are no technical courses like 
the courses in civil, mechanical, electrical, and mining engineering to 
claim the attention of the students. : 
The summarized statistics of the 127 institutions included in Division 
B of the table of colleges for women are given in the following tables:

VII.—CoLLEGES OF AGRICULTURE AND THE MECHANIC ARTS. 
(See Part IV, Tables 9-11, for full statistics.) 
The statistics concerning the colleges of agriculture and the mechanic 
arts endowed by the act of Congress of July 2, 1862, and further 
endowed by the act of Congress of August 30, 1890, are given in three
-P-A-G-E-103
    
AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGES. 93 
tables in Part IV of this report, the first two of which include the 
colleges for white students and those in which no distinction as to race 
and color is made in the admission of students, while the third table 
includes the institutions for students of the colored race. 
The acts on which these institutions depend mainly for their support 
have been printed a number of times in former reports of this office 
and itis therefore not deemed necessary to again insert them. It may, 
however, be of interest to state that in accordance with the provisions 
of the act of July 2, 1862, and of the acts admitting several of the 
newer States, 10,400,000 acres of land have been given by the General- 
Government to the several States for the endowment of agricultural 
and mechanical colleges. 
In some of the States the land was disposed of advantageously, 
while in a large number of the States the amounts realized from the 
sale of the lands are very small when compared with the number of 
acres received. ' In a few of the newer States the land can not, accord- 
ing to law, be sold for less than $10 per acre. This wise provision of 
law can not but prove of great benefit to the institutions of these 
States, as.the amounts realized from the sale of the lands will be con- 
siderably greater than the amounts realized by States that received 
four or five times as much land. The number of acres received by the 
several States, together with the income derived therefrom for the year 
1892-93, as reported by the institutions, is as follows:

From the above table it will be seen that in a number of the States 
no income is reported from the funds arising from the act of July 2, 1862. 
This is due to the fact that those States have not yet been able to dis- 
pose of their lands advantageously or at the rate required by law. 
The total income for 1892-93, arising from the funds derived from the | 
sale of these lands, was reported as $632,677.80. 
In addition to the lands granted by the act of July 2, 1862, the Gen- 
eral Government, by an act approved August 30, 1890, gives a certain 
sum of money annually to the agricultural and mechanical colleges. 
The amount granted by this act for the year ended June 30, 1890, was 
$15,000 for each State and Territory having an agricultural and mechan- 
ical college endowed by the act of July 2, 1862. The amount increases 
annually by $1,000 until the sum appropriated reaches $25,000 per 
annum, which sum will be the amount to be disbursed annually there- 
after to each State and Territory, provided certain requirements are 
complied with. 
The act of August 30, 1890, unlike the act of July 2, 1862, specifies 
the branches of study. for which the money granted may be dis- 
bursed. It shall “be applied only to instruction in agriculture, the 
mechanic arts, the English language, and the various branches of 
mathematical, physical, natural, and economic science, with special 
reference to their applications in the industries of life, and to the 
facilities for such instruction.” It is held that this language author- 
izes the purchase from this money of apparatus, machinery, text-books, 
reference books, stock, and material, used in instruction or for purposes 
of illustration in connection with any of the branches enumerated, and 
the paymentof salaries of instructors in said branches only. 
The erection of buildings is specifically prohibited by the act, and 
the Assistant Attorney-General for the Interior Department has decided

that the purchase of land and the payment of salaries of treasurers 
are not allowable. It should not be expended for repairs of buildings, 
furniture, cases, shelving, tableware, cooking utensils, musical instru- 
ments, the salaries of instructors in ancient and modern languages 
(except English), or for the salaries of professors of pedagogy; neither 
should it be expended for the salaries of secretaries, bookkeepers, jan- 
itors, watchmen, ete. In short, the plant—the land, buildings, and 
ordinary appliances of a school—must be provided from other sources, 
and this particular fund must be applied exclusively to the subjects 
named in the act and the facilities especially required for those subjects. 
The amounts disbursed to the several States and Territories to June 
30, 1893, under this act are as follows: AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGES.

  This table shows that under the above-mentioned act the several 
States and Territories have received to June 30, 1893, an aggregate sum 
of $3,010,000. 
In addition to the income derived from the acts of July 2, 1862, and 
August 30, 1890, these institutions have been fairly dealt with by the 
majority of the States in the way of State appropriations. The amount 
of such appropriations received by the institutions during the year 
under consideration was $1,634,715.18, of which sum $88,820.41 were for 
the institutions for colored students. Of the $1,634,715.18 appropri- 
ated, $761,471.17 were for buildings or other special purposes, leaving 
but $773,244.01 appropriated for current expenses. 
According to the acts of Congress in aid of colleges of agriculture 
and the mechanic arts none of the money arising from such acts can be 
expended for buildings. It has therefore been necessary, from the very 
founding of a large number of the institutions, for the several States 
to extend a. helping hand. 
The establishment of agricultural experiment stations in connection 
with these institutions has proved a great benefit, not only to the 
stations, but also to the colleges. The General Government appropri- 
ates annually $15,000 to cach State and Territory for the current 
expenses of the stations. -From this amount the staff of the station is 
paid. But frequently not all of the time of the staff is required by the 
station and the available time of such members of the staff is then 
given to the college. We thus find in a great majority of the States 
that some of the members of the station staff are also members of the 
college faculty. For instance, the professor of agriculture or the presi- 
dent of the college is also director of the station; the professor of hor- 
ticulture, the horticulturist of the station; the professor of botany, the 
botanist of the station, etc. In such cases the salaries of these per- 
sons are paid in part from the college funds and in part from the station 
funds, thus enabling the colleges, as well as the stations, to obtain the 
services of specialists at a much less cost to each than would be possi- 
ble if the stations were not in close proximity to the colleges. In but 
four States have the stations been established at places remote from 
the colleges. The staffs of the 44 stations established in connection 
with the agricultural colleges consist of 394 members. 
The detailed statistics concerning the agricultural and eek 
colleges are given in Part IV of this report. 
VIII.—Scnoous or THEOLOGY, LAW, AND MEDICINE, 
(See Part IV, Tables 13-19, for the detailed statistics of individual schools.) 
The number of students receiving professional instruction from year 
to year would not be expected to show any marked fluctuation, for the 
demand for such work increases only in a regular ratio, and unless the 
schools adopt new regulations the number of students would probably 
increase in the same ratio. The whole number of medical students in  
-P-A-G-E-107
PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS. ee 
1892-93 was 19,752. Of these the number in the regular medical schools 
was 16,130, an increase of about 1,200 over. the previous year. The 
number of theological students was 7,839. During the last five years 
the number of theological students has increased with much uni- 
formity, the figures being 6,989, 7,013, 7,328, 7,729, 7,839. 
During the year 1892-93 the number of law students was 6,776. The 
number of law students has been increasing quite rapidly, the figures 
for the last five years being 3,906, 4,518, 5,252, 6,073, 6,776. This 
increase, however, may be more apparent than real; it may possibly be 
attributed to a larger number of young men seeking regular and sys- 
tematic instruction in law schools rather than in the private offices of 
attorneys and counsellors.

102 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  ITX.—Normat ScHoots. 
In 1893, according to the returns made to the Bureau of Education, 
52,008 students were pursuing teachers’ training courses in the various 
institutions of the country. More than half these students, or 27,926, 
were in public normal schools. The private normal schools had 7,286 
students preparing for the work of teaching. Many normal sehools 
offer other courses of instruction, but the figures here given include 
only the number of students in the teachers’ training courses proper. 
In the universities and colleges 5,232 normal students were reported, 
and 4,803 were found in the public high schools and 6,761 in the private 
high schools and academies. Normal students were found in 868 dis- 
tinct institutions, but the number of graduates is given for only the 160 
public and private normal schools. These sent out 5,043 graduates 
equipped with diplomas or certificates. 
In Part IV of this report, Tables 20-22, the statistics of each of the 
publie and private normal schools are given in detail. These two tables 
are followed by another giving a list of the 155 universities and col- 
leges reporting students in the pedagogical or normal courses, showing 
the number of students in each. 
In this chapter are printed the statistical summaries of normal schools 
and tables showing the number and location of other institutions in 
which normal students are pursuing their studies. The statistics of 
public normal schools will be found in Tables 1 and 2, and the corre- 
sponding items for private normal schools are given in Tables 3 and 4, 
Table 1 gives the number of public normal schools in each State, the 
number of students, and the number of graduates. There were 121 
schools, 1,301 instructors, 8,635 male students, 19,293 female students, 
and 4,491 graduates. From Table 2 it is seen that these schools had 
17,777 students not in the teachers’ training courses. There were 14,167 
pupils reported in the model schools in connection with the public nor- 
mals. Included in the total number of normal students were 2,935 in 
colored normal schools. 
Tables 3 and 4 show that in the 39 normal schools under private 
management there were 268 teachers, 4,089 male normal students and 
3,197 females, and 552 graduates. The number of students reported in 
other courses of study, 7,469, exceeded the number of normal students, 
which was 7,286. The number of colored normal students was 3,797. 
In the model schools connected with these private institutions 911 
pupils are reported. 
Of the total number of students, 45,703, in all courses of study in the 
public normal schools, 27,926, or over 61 per cent, are in the teachers’ 
training courses, and less than 39 per cent, in other courses of study or 
departments. Of the total number of students in all courses of study 
in the private normal schools, 14,755, only 7,286, or 49 per cent, were in 
the teachers’ training courses. The larger proportion, or 51 per cent, 
were in commercial and other departments. 
Table 5 is a summary showing the income of public and private
-P-A-G-E-113
  NORMAL SCHOOLS. 103 
normal schools, the amounts received by State, county, and city appro- 
priations, the amount from tuition fees and from other sources. Public 
normal schools received $1,452,914 for support from State, county, or 
city, and private schools received $430 from the same sources. The 
public normals received from these sources $816,826 for building and 
the private normals $51,000. The public normals received $372,428 
from tuition fees and the private schools $133,957. The amount 
received from benefactions was $153,927 for public normal schools and 
$151,386 for the private schools. 
Table 6 shows the location of the 155 universities and colleges in which 
students are pursuing pedagogical courses. In these institutions are 
5,232 normal students. This number includes 727 colored students. 
Table 7 shows that in 264 public high schools there were 4,803 
normal students, all white. In 289 private high schools there were 
6,761 normal students, 484 of whom were colored. 
Table 8 combines the figuresin 6 and 7 and shows thatin the 708 institu- 
tions not public and private normal schools there Were 16,796 students 
pursuing teachers’ training courses. Of these1,211 were colored students. 
The following table will Show at a glance the distribution of the 
52,008 normal students, in which kind of institutions they are found, 
and in what section or division of the United States:

the sums appropriated for the support of these schools amounted to 
$1,284,453. The next year the amount appropriated for support was 
$1,312,419 and for buildings $900,533. In 1890-91 the amount for sup- 
port was $1,285,700 and for buildings $409,916. The highest agere- 
gate of appropriations for support was in 1891-92, when the amount 
reached $1,567,082, but the appropriations for building that year 
amounted to only $394,635. The highest total of appropriations was 
reached in 1892-93, when the amount was $2,269,740. Of this aggre 
gate $1,452,914 was for support and $816,826 for buildings. 
It is known that the two lists comprising 160 public and private nor- 
mal schools, published in Part V, do not include all the normal schools 
of the country. Only those institutions furnishing statistics to this 
Bureau appear in the lists. Repeated requests for information failed 
to bring responses from the others. It is hoped that the statistics of 
many of the schools omitted will appear in the next annual report.

CHAPTER II. 
ILLITERACY IN THE UNITED STATES.! 
(See tables, pp. 125-144.) 
  The three principal elements composing the population of the United 
States are the native whites, the foreign-born whites, and the blacks. 
In discussing the statisties of illiteracy it seems important to deal with 
these elements separately and then to inquire what influence one element 
may have upon each of the others or upon the other two combined. 
The total population of the country in. 1890 was 62,622,250. The native- 
born whites numbered 45,862,023, or 73.24 per cent; the foreign-born 
whites numbered 9,121,867, or 44.57 per cent, and the colored population 
was 7,638,360, or 12.19 per cent ox che whole. It is found that the 
smallest per cent of illiteracy belongs to the native white population 
and the greatest to the colored population. The foreign-born whites 
oecupy an intermediate position on the scale. 
The illiteracy tables have been arranged so that the 1890, 1880, and 
1870 statistics can be easily compared. Seven of these comparative 
tables are given on as many pages, compiled from the census reports. 
To facilitate a comparative study of the facts made prominent by the 
three censuses the tables have been rearranged by the: statistician of 
this Bureau and in some cases new computations made. 
The seven tables now show for 1890, for 1850, and for 1870 the total 
population 10 years of age and over, the number of illiterates, and the 
per cent of illiterates to the population 10 years of age and above for 
eaeh of the States and Territories, giving these numbers and. percent- 
ages for the total, for males, females, native whites, foreign-born whites, 
total whites, and for the colered population. The figures are arranged 
by divisions, so that the five great sections of the United States can be 
eompared or contrasted with each other or with the country as a whole. 
In the first column of Table 1 is given the population 10’ years of age 
and over for each State and Territory, for each of the five sections, and 
for the United States in 1890. The second column shows the number 
of illiterates and the third column gives the per cent of illiterates to the 
population 10 years of age and over. The next three columns on the 
same page give the corresponding items for 1880 and the remaining 
three show the corresponding figures for 1870.

116 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  In 1890, of a total population of 62,622,250, the number 10 years of 
age and over was 47,413,559. Of this number 6,324,702 could not read 
and write. These illiterates comprised 13.3 per cent of the population 
10 years of age and above. A comparison of these figures with the 
corresponding figures of 1880 will show a most gratifying decrease in 
the percentage of illiteracy. Of the total population of 50,155,783 in 
1880 the number 10 years of age and over was 36,761,607 and the 
number of illiterates was 6,239,958. Then the per cent of illiterates 
was 17. While the total population of the country increased 12,466,467, 
or almost 25 per cent, the number of illiterates increased only 84,744, 
or about 14 per cent. So the actual rate of illiteracy fell from 17 per 
cent in 1880 to 13.3 per cent in 1890, a difference of 3.7 in the rates, an 
actual reduction of nearly 22 per cent in the percentage. Had the 
same rate obtained for 1890 as for 1880 the number of illiterates in 
1890 would have been 8,060,305 rather than 6,324,702, and the actual 
gain in numbers would have been 1,820,347 rather than 84,744. 
These figures will give some idea of the progress in elementary educa- 
tion which the United States must have made in the ten years in order 
to make so marked a reduction in the per cent and in the comparative 
number of illiterates. This fact is illustrated by diagram 1, which is a 
graphic comparison of the statistics of 1890, 1880, and 1870. 
A further examination of Table 1, under the 1890 column, will show 
the relative standing of the States and sections in regard to illiteracy. 
The percentage of illiteracy is smallest in the North Central Division 
and greatest in the South Atlantic, being 5.7 for the former and 30.9 
for the latter. In the Sonth Central Division the per cent of illiterates 
is 29.7,in the North Atlantic 6.2, and in the Western Division 8.3. 
The State having the smallest percentage of illiteracy is Nebraska, with 
3.1, and that having the largest Louisiana, with 45.8. 
The accompanying chart will indicate the relative density of illiteracy 
in the States and Territories. 
A glance at Table 14 will find the relative rank or standing of the 
States and Territories for the years 1890, 1880, and 1870, those States 
showing the smallest per cents of illiteracy standing at the tops of the 
columns. 
Diagram 2 shows graphically the relative standing of the five divi- 
sions in 1890, 1880, and 1870. Diagram 4 shows the rank of each State 
in 1890 according to the percentages of illiteracy. 
The most interesting study of Table 1 is that which will reveal the 
relative progress made by the several States and sections between 1880 
and 1890. The North Atlantic Division shows no change in the per 
cent of illiterates. While the rate remained at 6.2 the actual number 
of illiterates had increased from 699,369 to 859,989. In the North Cen- 
tral Division the per cent of illiteracy dropped from 6.7 to 5.7, but the 
number increased from 853,020 to 964,268, and in the Western Division 
the rate fell from 11.3 to 8.3, while the number of illiterates increased 
 
-P-A-G-E-127
  ILLITERACY IN THE UNITED STATES. 117 
from 155,150 to 199,686. Only in the two Southern sections was there 
actual decrease in the number of illiterates. As a consequence the 
decrease in the percentage of illiteracy was very great. In the South 
Atlantic Division the number decreased from 2,129,830 in 1880 to 
1,981,888 in 1890, and the per cent fell from 40.3 to 30.9. In the South 
Central Division the improvement was quite as marked, the number 
falling from 2,402,589 to 2,318,871 and the per cent from 39.5 to 29.7. 
Between 1880 and 1890 all the Southern States actually decreased 
their numbers of illiterates, as well as the percentages, excepting Ala- 
bama, Louisiana, and Arkansas. In the other divisions the States of 
Indiana and Missouri and the Territories of New Mexico and Utah alone 
show decrease in the actual number of illiterates. For purposes of 
comparison Missouri should be classed with the Southern States, but 
in the census classification it is in the North Central Division where 
the geographical position of the State properly places it. 
In the United States nine States and one Territory increased their 
rates of illiteracy between 1880 and 1890, four in the North Atlantic 
Division, three in the North Central, and three in the Western Division. 
Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, New Jersey, Michigan, Wisconsin, 
North Dakota, Montana, Arizona, and Nevada increased not only their 
number of illiterates, but their rates as well. 
In justice to North Dakota it should be noted that. the rate of illiter- 
acy in 1890 is compared with the percentage for the entire Territory of 
Dakota in 1880, This comparison may show a higher rate of increase 
for North Dakota and a greater rate of decrease in the per cent of 
illiterates for South Dakota than is equitable. 
Table 11 is a comparison of the rates of illiteracy in all the States for 
the census years 1890 and 1880 for all classes. 
Table 12 shows the differences between the percentages of illiteracy 
for the several States in 1880 and 1890 for all classes. Those whose 
rates of illiteracy increased are marked with the + sign and those 
whose rates were less in 1890 than in 1880 are marked with the — sign. 
Table 13 is derived from 11 and 12 and shows for each State and 
division the per cent of decrease or increase in the percentage of 
illiterates between 1880 and 1890. These rates are computed for each 
element of population and are the figures which indicate the relative 
progress made in the ten years in overcoming the mass of illiteracy 
which existed in 1880. In the table the — sign indicates decrease in 
the percentage of illiteracy, and the + sign denotes increase in the 
rate. <A glance at the first column will show that in ten States there 
was increase in the rates. For the whole country there was a decrease 
in the rate from 17.0 in 1880 to 13.3 in 1890, or a 21.8 per cent decrease 
inthe percentage. This figure, 21.8, is a measure of the actual progress 
made in recucing the relative ratio of illiteracy to the total population. 
Diagram 5 shows the rank of each State in 1890, graded according to 
the rate of progress or retrogression made by each in the preceding

decade. The oper lines mark the States which decreased their rates of 
illiteracy, and the dark lines are placed opposite the States which 
retrograded or increased their per cents of illiterates. 
An idea of the relative progress made by the several States may be 
obtained by a study of this diagram in connection with the first column 
of Table 13, which it graphically illustrates. Washington stands at the 
head of the list on the diagram marked with 38.6 per cent. Thisis the 
per cent of difference between Washington’s rates of illiteracy in 1880 
and 1890. This means that Washington overcame a greater per cent of 
the illiteracy of the State than any other State or Territory.

  ILLITERACY IN THE UNITED STATES. 145 
‘New Mexico occupies the sixth place, credited with 31.5 per cent of 
decrease. New York holds the thirty-seventh place in the list and is 
marked 0, for the reason that the rates in 1880 and 1890 were the same. 
It is true that New Mexico had greater room for improvement than 
New York, the percentage of illiteracy for the former standing at 65 
in 1880, which was reduced to 44.5 in 1890, while New York’s rate was 
only 5.5 at the two periods indicated. While it is undoubtedly true 
that New York was performing immeasurably greater work for higher 
and secondary education and better work in elementary education per- 
haps, New Mexico deserves the credit of having accomplished rela- 
~ tively more in the foundation work. While New Mexico stood at the 
very bottom of the list in literacy in 1880 and was only two places 
removed from that unenviable distinction in 1890, that Territory must 
have the credit of having made a wider gap between her two positions 
than any other State or Territory. 
The 9 States and 1 Territory standing at the foot of the list, marked 
+ in Diagram 5, actually retrograded, as has already been shown. 
While several of these States undoubtedly made great progress in 
secondary and higher education, and in most cases improved their 
systems of elementary education, the fact remains that the rates of 
illiteracy in these Commonwealths were higher in 1890 than ten years 
before. An examination of the second column of Table 13, in which 
the States have been graded according to the progress made by the 
native white population alone, will reveal the fact that the retrogres- 
sion of several States was due to the influx of an illiterate foreign 
element. This cause will be noticed latter on. 
Table 14 indicates the rank of each State in literacy in 1890, 1880, 
and 1870, the States having the smaller per cents of illiterate popula- 
tion standing at the heads of the lists. It may be interesting to note 
how States changed places in the twenty years. Thus in 1870 Wyo- 
ming held the sixteenth place in 1880 it appeared at the top, while in 
1890 it oceupied the second place. In 1870 New Hampshire was the 
second State, in 1880 the sixth, and in 1890 the twenty-sixth. 
Table 15 ranks the States with reference to the illiteracy of the 
native white population, Table 16 with reference to the foreign white, 
Table 17 to the total white, and Table 18 with reference to the illiter- 
acy of the colored population. These tables not only show the rank of 
each State, but also the per cent of illiterates in each. 
Table 2 gives the male population 10 years of age and over, the num- 
ber of illiterate males, and the per cent of illiterate males to the male 
population 10 years of age and over for each of the States and Terri- 
tories for 1890, 1880, and 1870. A comparison of the percentages will 
show that the rate fell from 15.8 in 1880 to 12.4 in 1890, both rates 
being lower than the per cents of illiteracy to the male and female 
population combined. In the North Atlantic Division the rate of illt- 
eracy to the male population increased from 5.4 per cent to 5.9. In all

  the other divisions there was decrease in the rate, and in the South 
this decrease was very marked, being even greater than the general 
decrease of illiteracy in that section. The increase in the North At- 
lantic States was probably due to the increase in the proportion of 
illiterate foreign-born males, while the decrease in the South can be 
attributed in part to the fact that among the blacks more males than 
females learned to read and write. A comparison of Table 2 with the 
succeeding table will further emphasize the fact that the decrease in 
the relative number of illiterates was greater among the males than 
among the females. 
Fourteen States and one Territory show increase in the per cent of 
illiterates among males, all in the North Atlantic, North Central, and 
Western divisions. In addition to the 9 States and 1 Territory already 
mentioned as having increased their rates of illiteracy to the general 
population, the States of Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Wyo- 
ming, and California show increase in their rates of illiteracy to the 
male population. The rate of illiteracy for malesin Massachusetts stood 
at the same figure in 1890 and 1880. Rhode Island was the only State 
in the North Atlantic Division which decreased the rate of illiteracy 
among the males between 1880 and 1890, the rate in 1880 being 9.8 and 
9in 1890. In column 2 of Table 12 are shown the differences between 
the 1880 and 1890 xates of illiteracy to the male population for each of 
the States. Those marked + show actual increase in their per cents of 
illiteracy, and those marked — showing decrease. 
An examination of Table 3 and the third column of Table 12 will 
show that, with one excepiion, all the States in which there was a 
decrease in illiteracy compared to the general population there was also 
deerease in the rates of illiteracy to the female population. The single 
exception is the State of Minnesota, in which the general rate of illit- 
eracy was somewhat smaller, while the per cent to the female popula- 
tion remains the same. New York, which made no change in the 
general rate between 1880 and 1890, shows an increase in the rate of 
illiteracy of the male population and a corresponding decrease in the 
percentage to the female population. 
By a comparison between the second and third columns of Table 12 
it will be seen that in the North Atlantic Division there was a small 
increase in the rate of illiteracy to the male population and a corre- 
sponding decrease in the per cent to the female population. In the 
South Atlantic and South Central divisions the decrease in illiteracy 
among the males was considerably greater than the decrease of the 
rate among the females, as already noted. In the North Central Divi- 
sion the improvement is somewhat greater in the male population, while 
in the Western Division the difference is decidedly in favor of the 
female population, The decrease of illiteracy for the male population 
in that division was from 10.1 to 8.1, while the decrease for the female 
population was from 13.6 to 8.7. For the whole country the rate of
-P-A-G-E-157
  
ILLITERACY IN THE UNITED STATES. : 147 
  improvement was in favor of the female population by a small fraction 
of 1 per cent. 
A comparison of Tables 2 and 3, or more conveniently columns 3 and 
5 of Table 11, will show the relative rates of illiteracy to the male and 
female population 10 years of age and over. For the year 1890 the 
per cent of illiterates to the male population was 12.4, and to the female 
population 14.4. In the North Atlantic Division the rates were, for 
males 5.9, for females 6.5; South Atlantic, males 29.1, females 32.6; 
South Central, males 27.6, females 31.9; North Central, males 5.2, 
females 6.3; Western Division, males 8.1, females 8.7. 
Table 4 presents the illiteracy statistics of the native white popnla- 
tion in 1890, 1880, and 1870. It is most gratifying to trace the steady 
progress made by the native white race through the two decades. In 
1870 the per cent of illiterates to the native white population 10 years of © 
age and over was 10.8, and in 1880 it was 8.7, In that decade there had 
been improvement in each of the five divisions of the country. In the 
North Atlantic Division the per cent of illiterates had fallen from 
3.2 to 2.8; in the South Atlantic from 24.2 to 20; in the South Central 
from 24 to 22; in the North Central from 7.6 to 5, and in the Western 
Division from 16 to 8.6. 
In the ten years from 1880 to 1890 the advancement of the native 
white population was even greater. The number of illiterates had 
decreased from 2,255,400 in 1880 to 2,065,003 in 1890, notwithstanding 
the inerease of 24.5 per cent in the number of the native whites. The 
per cent of illiteracy had fallen from 8.7 in a population of 25,785,789 
to 6.2 in native white population of 33,144,187, ten years of age and 
over. In each of the five divisions there had also been an actual 
decrease in the number of native white illiterates, as well as in the 
rates. In the North Atlantic the rate was reduced from 2.8 to 2.3, in 
the South Atlantic from 20 to 14.6, in the South Central from 22 to 
15, in the North Central from 5 to 3.4, and in the Western Division 
from 8.6 to 4.5. Ina greater number of States the actual number of 
native white illiterates had decreased from 1880 to 1890. 
In 8 of the States—Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, 
Louisiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Montana—there was a slight 
increase in the per cent of native white illiterates, but in no case did this 
increase exceed the fraction of 1 per cent. The fifth column of Table 12 
will show the differences between the rates in 1890 and 1880 for each 
State, those marked + having increased their rates as indicated. Col- 
umns 9 and 10 of Table 11 give a comparison of the rates for the two 
years. The second column of Table 13 gives the percentage of decrease 
or increase in the rates of illiteracy in each State, showing the relative 
progress of the native whites in each State during the decade. 
The native white population of the United States increased about 
24.5 per cent from 1880 to 1890, the colored population about 13 per 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
  148 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
cent, while the foreign-born white population increased more than 39 
per cent. In other words, in 1880, the colored population comprised 
13.5 per cent of the whole, while in 1890 it was only 12.2 per cent. In 
1880 the foreign-born white population was 13.1 per cent of the whole, 
but in 1890 the per cent had risen to 14.6. During the decade immi- 
gration was increasing our foreign population more rapidly than the 
birth-rate could increase our native population. 
Table 8 gives the total population for 1890 by States and Territories, 
and also the native white, foreign white, and colored population, and 
the per cent of each to the total. Tables 9 and 10 give the like statistics 
for 1880 and 1870, <A study of these tables will prove interesting in 
connection with the examination of the statistics of illiteracy among 
the three elements of our population. 
In the first place, it will be noted that the foreign-born whites num- 
bered 9,121,867, or 14.6 per cent of the entire population in 1890, an 
increase from 6,559,679 in 1880, when the per cent to the whole popula- 
tion was less than 13.1. In the North Atlantic Division in 1890 there 
were 3,874,866 foreigners, or 22.3 per cent of the population of that sec- 
tion. In 1880 the per cent was only 19.4. In the North Central Divi- 
sion in 1890 there were 4,053,457 foreigners, or 18.1 per cent of the 
population of that section. In 1880 the per cent was only 16.8. In the 
Western Division the foreign-born whites numbered 672,649, or 22.2 
per cent. Although this was a very large increase from 397,019, the 
number of foreign whites in that division in 1880, the per cent to the 
total remained about the same. 
In the South Atlantic Division in 1890 the foreign-born whites num- 
bered only 202,316, the per cent to the total population being only 2.3, or 
about the same as in 1890. In the South Central Division the percent- 
age of foreigners fell from 3 in 1880 to 2.9 in 1890, when the number 
was only 318,579. 
The ninth column of Table 12 will show in which States the per cent 
of foreign population increased or decreased between 1880 and 1890. 
The tenth column indicates the same for the colored population, and 
the eighth column shows where there was increase or decrease in the 
per cent of native white population. The figures marked + indicate 
increase in the percentages, and those marked — show where there has 
been decrease in the per cents. These figures are the differences 
between the rates in corresponding columns of Tables 8 and 9, and are 
used only to more plainly mark the States in which the three elements 
of population have made gains or losses in their ratio to the whole 
population of a State. 
Table 5 shows what was the foreign-born white population in 1890, 10 
years of age and over, the number who could not read and write, and 
the per cent of illiterates to this foreign population. The correspond- 
ing figures are given for 1880 and for 1870 on the same page. The for-
-P-A-G-E-159
  ILLITERACY IN THE UNITED STATES. 149 
eign-born population 10 years of age and over in 1890 was 8,786,887, and 
of this number 1,147,571 were illiterates. The number of illiterates had 
increased from 763,620 in 1880, or from 12 per cent to 13.1. In each of 
the five divisions of the country the increase in the per cent of illiteracy 
of the foreign white population is marked. This increase is maintained 
in all the States save 9. In New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island, 
Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Mexico, and Utah there was 
more or less decrease in the rate of illiteracy among the foreign-born 
whites. 
More than three-fourths of the illiterate foreigners of the North Atlan- 
tic Division are in the States of Massachusetts, New York, and Penn- 
sylvania. In the South Atlantic more than half the foreign illiterates 
are in Maryland, and in the South Central Division morcethan two-thirds 
of them are in Texas, and a large portion of the remainder will be found 
in Louisiana. In the North Central Division they are more evenly dis- 
tributed, though Hlinois has more than any other State. In the West- 
ern Division nearly one-half the illiterate foreigners are in California. 
In the States mentioned are the large cities of Boston, New York, 
Philadelphia, Baltimore, New Orleans, Chicago, and San Francisco. 
Of the foreign illiterates in the South Central Division nearly 9,000. are 
in Louisiana, or New Orleans, and over 42,000 in Texas. Most of the 
latter are Mexicans. The presence of Mexicans in New Mexico and 
Avizona raises the per cent of illiterates to the foreign white popula- 
tion to 30 and 42, respectively, which are higher than the rates for the 
foreign whites in any other part of the country. 
It is important to note that of the native white population 72.3 per 
cent is 10 years of age and over, while 96.3 per cent of the foreign-born 
white population exceeds that age. Of the colored population 71.8 
per cent is 10 years of age and over. Of the foreign illiterates a much 
larger proportion is beyond the reach of schools than of the native 
illiterates. 
In Table 11, columns 11 and 12, will be found a comparison of the 
rates of illiteracy for the foreign-born white population for 1890 and 
1880. In Table 12, column 6, will be seen the differences between the 
1880 and 1890 rates for each State and Territory, only the 7 marked — 
showing decrease in the percentage. 
Diagram 3 is a graphic illustration of the relative number of illiter- 
ates in the three classes of population. 
To what extent does the presence of foreign-born illiterates increase 
the rate of illiteracy to the whole population of the United States? 
The influence of this foreign element may be inferred from the facts 
made prominent in the table below. The third column shows the per 
cent of illiterates to the native white population 10 years of age and 
over in 1890 for the whole country and for each division. The fourth 
column gives the per cent of illiterates to the foreign white population,
-P-A-G-E-160

while the fifth shows the rate for the two combined, or for the entire 
white population.

  The per cent of illiteracy for the native white population is 6.2. This 
represents 2,065,003 native-born whites who can not read and write. 
The per cent of illiteracy to the foreign-born white population is 13.1, 
representing 1,147,571 foreign-born whites who can not read and write. 
The addition of this foreign element raises the rate of illiteracy for the 
total white population 10 years of age and over to 7.7 for the whole 
country. 
A comparison of columns 3, 4, and 5 in the above table will reveal 
the extent of this influence in the several sections. The influence is 
greatest in the North Atlantic Division, where it changes a native 
white illiteracy of 2.3 per cent to a combined white illiteracy of 5.9 
per cent. Nearly two-thirds of the white illiterates in that division 
are foreigners. In the North Central Division, where nearly one-half 
of the white illiterates are foreigners, the 3.4 per cent of native white 
illiteracy is raised to 5.1 for the combined white population. In the 
Western Division less than half the white illiterates are foreigners, but 
their presence increases the rate from 4.5 for the native whites to 6.2 
for the combined white population. In the two Southern divisions the 
number of foreigners is so small that their presence has but little influ- 
ence in raising or lowering the general rate of illiteracy. 
What is the effect of the great mass of colored illiterates in the South- 
ern States upon the per cent of illiteracy to the combined population of 
the three elements? Compare columns 2, 5, and 6, in the foregoing 
table. Of the 6,324,702 illiterates in the United States 3,112,128, or 
nearly one-half, are colored. This element, constituting 56.8 per cent of 
the colored population 10 years of age and over, raises the per cent of 
illiteracy from 7.7 for the white population to 13.3 for the whole popu- 
lation of the country. This influence is, of course, most strongly felt in 
the two Southern divisions, where the rate of illiteracy for the entire 
population is double that for the white population alone. This is easily 
understood when it is noted that more than 30 per cent of the popula- 
tion of the two Southern divisions is colored, and that the rate of illit- 
eracy to the colored population is over 60 per cent in the South. But 
the presence of colored illiterates is also felt in other divisions. In the 
North Atlantic the illiteracy of the small colored population raises the 
rate of 5.9 for the white population to 6.2 for the whole. In the North 
Central the rate is raised from 5.1 to 5.7 and in the Western Division
-P-A-G-E-161
  ILLITERACY IN THE UNITED STATES, PEE 
from 6.2 to 8.3 by reason of the presence of colored illiterates. A more 
careful study of the comparative rates as shown in Tables 11 and 12 
will give an idea of the influence of an illiterate colored population in 
each State in raising the general rate of illiteracy. 
Before examining in detail the illiteracy statisties of the colored pop- 
wation it may be well to combine the other two elements of our popu- 
lation so that the statistics of the whites and blacks may be studied in 
contrast or by comparison. 
Table 6 gives the total white population 10 years of age and over for 
the whole country for each State and section in 1890, 1880, and 1870, 
the number of illiterates, and the percentage of illiteracy. This table 
includes the native whites and foreign whites, and excludes the negroes, 
Chinese, Japanese, and Indians. 
The relative standing of the white population in aed to illiteracy 
for the years 1890 and 1880 will beshown by a glance at columns 7 and 
Sof Table 11. The rate of illiteracy for each of the three years is given 
for each State and Territory. Column 4 of Table 12 will show which 
States have made gains and which losses in their rates of illiteracy to 
the white population from 1880 to 1890, In 1880 the rate of illiteracy 
among the whites was 9.4, and in 1890 it had fallen to 7.7. In the 
North Atlantic Division the rate stood the same for both years, 5.9. In 
the South Atlantie the difference between the rates in 1880 and 1890 
was 5; in the South Central, 6.3; in the North Central, 0.8; and in the 
Western Division, 2.6. The difference between the rates for the entire 
country was 1.7. In the column relating to the total whites the 14 
States and Territories marked + show increase in the per cents of 
illiterates to the white population, and all the others marked — show, 
decrease in the rates of illiteracy. 
Table 7 presents the illiteracy statistics of the colored population of 
the United States from 1870 to 1890. In 1890 the colored population 
of the country 10 years of age and over was 5,482,485. Of this number 
3,112,128, or 56.8 per cent, could not read and write. Although the col- 
ored people composed less than one-eighth the entire population, nearly 
one-half the illiterates of the country were colored. In the North 
Atlantic Division, where there is but a small negro population, only 
229,858 ten years of age and over in the 9 States, the percentage of 
illiterates is smallest, or only 21.7. In the North Central Division the 
colored rate of illiteracy is 32.8. In the Western Division the percent- 
age of illiteracy to the colored population is 41.5. It should be remarked 
that the 60,029 colored illiterates in that division are nearly all Chinese 
Japanese, and Indians. 
In the South Atlantic Division the per cent of illiterates to the col- 
ored population is 60.1, and in the South Central Division the rate is 
61.2. In these two Southern divisions there are 4,759,040 blacks 10 
years of age and over, of whom 2,887,776 can not read and write. The 
State in that section having the highest rate of illiteracy is Louisiana, 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  152 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  with 72.1 per cent, and that with the lowest is West Virginia, with 44.4 
per cent. In the District of Columbia, which belongs to the South 
Atlantic Division, the per cent is 35. On account of its geographical 
position Missouri has not been included with either of the two South- 
ern divisions. That State has 47,562 colored illiterates, comprising 41.7 
per cent of its colored population 10 years of age and above. A study 
of the first three columns of Table 7 and a glance at the chart in the 
first part of this chapter will show how the dark cloud of illiteracy 
overshadows the Southern part of the country. In this section, includ- 
ing all the former slave States save one, more than 60 per cent of the 
blacks are illiterates. 
Dark as this picture may appear now, it was darker in 1880, and still 
darker in 1870. In 1880, of a colored population of 4,601,207 ten years 
of age and over, there were 3,220,878, or 70 per cent, who could not read 
and write. In 1870, of a colored population of 3,511,075 above the 
10-year age, there were 2,806,223 illiterates, or 79.9 per cent. There was 
marked progress from 1870 to 1880, but from 1880 to 1890 the improve- 
ment was wonderful. Notonly was thenumber of illiterates decreased 
from 3,220,878 to 3,112,128 in the face of a 13 per cent increase in the 
total colored population, but the rate of illiteracy fell from 70 in 1880 
to 56.8 in 1890, In the South Atlantic Division the rate was reduced 
from 75.1 in 1880 to 60.1 in 1890, and in the South Central it was 
reduced from 76 in 1880 to 61.2 in the same period. In the North 
Atlantic Division the rate was only decreased from 24.2 to 21.7. It is 
a fact that in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Massachusetts, 
where the proportion of colored people is very small, there was actual 
increase in the per cent of colored illiteracy. This will be seen by a 
glance at the top of column 7 of Table 12 and a comparison of the rates 
in Table 11. In Michigan and North Dakota increase is shown in the 
rate of illiteracy among the colored population. In the Western Division 
there was a pronounced increase in the illiteracy of this class. This is 
shown in all the States and Territories of that division excepting New 
Mexico, Utah, and Oregon. As before explained, this retrogression is 
due to the presence of illiterate Chinese and Indians. 
In the last column of Table 13 will be found for each State and Ter- 
ritory and division the per cent of decrease or increase in the percent- 
age of illiterates between 1880 and'1890, For the whole United States 
the rate of illiteracy to the colored population in 1880 was 70; in 1890 
it was 56.8. There was thus a decrease of 18.9 per cent in the per- 
centage in the ten years. This figure (18.9) represents the rate of prog- 
ress made by the blacks between 1880 and 1890 in overcoming their 
mass of illiterates. 
In like manner it will be clear that 10.3 per cent is a mark of the 
progress made by the colored people in the North Atlantic Division, 
20 per cent in the South Atlantic, 19.5 in the South Central, and 20.4 
in the North Central divisions in overcoming their percentages of 
illiteracy. The Western Division shows a retrogression of 25 per cent.
-P-A-G-E-163
  ILLITERACY IN THE UNITED STATES. 153 
  In the Southern divisions the greatest relative progress made by the 
blacks was in Texas, where the decrease between the rates in 1880 and 
1890 was 30,4 per cent. The Southern State standing next in the list 
is Arkansas, with a per cent of 28.5. Florida stands next, with 28.4 
per cent. Louisiana stands at the bottom of the list in the South, 
having reduced the former percentage of colored illiteracy only 8.8 per 
cent. 
In this connection an examination of columns 13 and 14 of Table 11 
and column 7 of Table 12 may prove interesting to those who care to 
make further comparisons of the progress of the blacks in the several 
States between 1880 and 1890. 
Table 18 shows the rank of each State in 1890, 1880, and 1870 with 
reference to the illiteracy of its colored population. The State stand- 
ing at the head of each column had the smallest per cent of illiteracy 
to its colored population in the year indicated. Nevada held the first 
place in 1870, the eleventh place in 1880, and the forty-second place in 
1890. An inspection of the table will reveal the changes of position 
made by other States. 
The table which follows shows in parallel columns the rank of six- 
teen Southern States and the District of Columbia with reference to 
the rates of illiteracy to the colored population in each in 1890, 1880, 
and 1870, The table not only indicates the rank of each State, but the 
per cent of colored illiterates in each is given for the three census 
years. In 1870 Texas occupied the fifteenth place, with a percentage 
of 88.7. In 1880 that State was twelfth in the list, with a percentage 
of 75.4, and in 1890 it had reached the seventh place and had reduced 
the rate to 52.5. ;

Whether the remarkable progress made by the blacks of the South 
in the last twenty years is due more to the aid of the whites who pay 
the school taxes than to the efforts of the negroes themselves is not a 
question for discussion here. It would be more important to know how

  far above mere reading and writing their education extends and what 
use they are making of their newly acquired knowledge. Future 
inquiries of the Bureau of Education will from year to year bring out 
information on these questions. 
The rate of illiteracy is greater among the colored females of the 
South than among the colored males. In many of the larger towns and 
cities large numbers of blacks of the voting age attend night schools 
to prepare themselves for the exercise of one of the privileges of citi- 
zenship. Recent ballot laws which make it necessary that the voter 
should be able to read and mark his own ticket are undoubtedly acting 
as an educational stimulant to the colored men. At least a surmise as 
to the extent of the influence of this force in elementary education 
may be gained from an examination of the colored illiteracy statistics, 
in which are shown separately the number of male and female illiter- 
ates, and the number of each between certain ages. 
It isclaimed that much of the decrease in the rate of illiteracy among 
the blacks is due to the fact that the old illiterate ex-slaves are rapidly 
dying off and that the per cent of decrease in the number of illiterates 
somewhat exaggerates the real progress made by the race. To what 
extent this is true may be inferred from a comparison of the rates of 
illiteracy to the adult population for the three census years. But the 
figures can not rob the blacks of the credit of having made steady and 
certain progress in the last two decades. 
Table 19 is a table of miscellaneous statistics which may haye some 
relation to the statistics of illiteracy. The table gives for each State 
the area, population per square mile, number of persons of school age 
in 1890, the public common-school enrollment, per cent of enrollment 
to population, the average length of school term, the number of school- 
houses, number of square miles to each schoolhouse, and the per cent 
of illiterates. The curious may find instruction in tracing the supposed 
relation of enrollment, number of schoolhouses, or length of school 
term to the per cent of illiteracy. 
This chapter may be appropriately concluded with a reference to the 
illiteracy statistics of other countries. Table 20, compiled by Dr. L. R. 
Klemm, shows the percentages of illiteracy in the countries of Europe. 
In Germany the per cent of illiteracy to the male population, taking the 
census of army recruits, is 0.24, or less than one-quarter of 1 per cent. 
In Sweden and Norway the rate is 0.12, and in Denmark 0,54, as found. 
from a like source. In Vinland, according to a census of 1892, the per 
cent of illiterates to the male and female population 10 years of age 
and over was 1.62. From various sources the rates for other countries 
are given as follows:

first class, in number equal to half the number of representatives, elected directly 
by the voters; second class, elected by provincial councils, their number being pro- 
portioned to the population of the respective provinces. Representatives elected 
directly by the voters, number proportioned to the popu: 
1 for every 40,006 inhabitants, 
Every citizen over 25 years of age, domiciled for not less than one year in the same 
commune and not legally disqualified, has a vote. (Law of September 7, 1893.) 
A supplementary vote is allowed to every citizen over 35 years of age, married or 
widower, with legitimate issue and paying at least-5 francs ($1) a year in house tax; 
also to every citizen over 25 years of age owning real estate to the value of 2,000 
frances ($400) or having a corresponding income from such property, or who for two 
years has derived at least 100 francs a year from Belgian funds cither directly or 
through the savings bank. 
Two supplementary votes are given to citizens over 25 years of age who have 
received a diploma or certificate of higher instruction or who fill or have filled office 
or engaged in private professional practice, implying at least average higher instruc- 
tion. (Statesman’s Year Book, 1894, pp. 376, 377.) 
Under the law of September 7, 1893, amending the constitution, the number of 
electors is raised to 1,200,000 as against 135,000 under the former conditions (Con- 
stitution 1831, and law of March 17, 1848), which allowed the franchise only to male 
citizens paying a direct annual tax of at least 42.32 franes ($8.40). 
The divisions of the Kingdom for local government are provinces (9) and com- 
munes (2,596, census of 1890), both of which enjoy a large measure of autonomy. 
The affairs of the former are administered by a governor appointed by the King, 
a provincial council (elected), and a permanent deputation, consisting of the goy- 
ernor and six members of the council chosen by that body. 
Three distinct authorities participate also in the administration of the commune: 
an elected council, a burgomaster appointed by the King from the members of the 
council, and a body of aldermen (collége échevinal), consisting of the burgomaster 
and from 2 to 5 members of the council chosen by that body. The council, which 
represents the people directly, is the principal source of authority in communal 
affairs (Law regulating provincial and communal organization, March 30, 1836, and 
modifying laws, 1838, 1842, 1848, 1860, 1865; also Les ministres dans les principaux 
pays d’Europe et d’Amérique, par L. Dupriez, tome 1, pp. 262-266). 
‘The provinces are also divided into arrondissements and these again into cantons. 
These divisions are intended to facilitate the control of the central authority, and 
are not strictly speaking divisions for local government, 
In three provinces lying along the border of France, i. ¢., Hainault, Luxembourg, 
and Namur, and also in Liége, a central province, French or Walloon is the prevailing 
language. In Antwerp, Brabant, East and West Flanders, and Limbourg, the Flem- 
ish or Dutch. 
The population of Belgium, as shown by the census of 1890, was 6,069,321, comprised 
in an area of 11,373 square miles. Further analysis gives 2,894,694 as the population 
of communes of 5,000 inhabitants or more, and 3,174,627 for communes of less than 
5,000 inhabitants. 
The census by sex gives men 3,026,954; women, 3,042,367. It appears, moreover, 
that about 36 per cent of the males (1,079,035) and 40 per cent of the females (1,204,647), 
or 38 per cent of the entire population, are unable to read and write. In 1866 illiter- 
ates formed 53 per cent and in 1880 42 per cent of the entire population. 
Belgium is preeminently a Catholic country. Protestants number only about 
10,000 and Jews 4,000. The census of 1890 gives 30,098—men 4,775, women 25,323— 
members of religious orders in the Kingdom, of whom 24,585 are native Belgians. 
The executive affairs of the Government are administered through seven depart- 
ments. The educational interests are intrusted to the minister of the interior and of 
public instruction.! ion, but may not exceed 7 y

  PUBLIC EDUCATION IN BELGIUM. EDO 
SYSTEM OF PUBLIC EDUCATION. 
General view.—The educational system of Belgium, like that of 
France, preserves many features of the Imperial University, estab- 
lished by Napoleon.! In Belgium, however, there is the form without 
the spirit of centralization, local freedom, especially in the department 
of elementary education, being the ruling principle. 
All grades of instruction receive State support, and all institutions 
sharing in the public funds are subject in some measure to State inspee- 
tion. Schools, colleges, and universities are maintained by public and 
private, central and local agencies. 
The central administration, like the ministry of public instruction in 
France, is organized in three departments, corresponding to the three 
commonly recognized grades of instruction, i. e., primary, secondary, 
and superior. The chief educational officials under the minister of the 
interior and of public instruction, are two general directors, one for 
primary instruction, the other for secondary and superior. 
The minister also maintains a supervision over secondary and pri- 
mary instruction, as in France, by the agency of inspectors, i. e., for 
secondary instruction (enseignement moyen), one general inspector and 
two ordinary inspectors, one for the humanities, the other for mathe- 
matics and the sciences; and for primary instruction one or more prin- 
cipal inspectors in each of the nine provinces of the Kingdom, and sub- 
ordinate cantonal inspectors. 
The Belgian State universities, like the French Facultés, are not 
only teaching bodies, but constitute also part of the machinery for the 
public administration of superior instruction. In the Belgian system 
there is nothing exactly corresponding to the superior council of public 
instruction or to the academic and departmental councils which are 
important features of the French organization. These are suggested, 
however, by the deliberative councils (conseils de perfectionnement), 
one for each of the three departments of the Belgian system. These 
councils, which are formed by appointment from the official and pro- 
fessional bodies, deliberate upon scholastic affairs submitted to them 
by the minister, but have not the judicial functions of the French 
councils. 
In Belgium, as in France, the appointment of professors for the public 
secondary and superior institutions and the regulations of their pro- 
grammes are prerogatives of the central authority, while the appoint- 
ment of primary teachers rests with local authorities. 
A further resemblance to the French organization is noticeable in the 
union of State, provincial, and communal agencies and resources for 
the direction and maintenance of education. But with these external 
features, the resemblance ends; in spirit the two systems are radically 
different; in the Republic there is a high degree of centralization, in 
the Kingdom everything tends to decentralization. In both countries

the three orders of education have their distinct origin and history, and 
although now ‘coordinated into organic systems are still managed as 
separate departments of those systems.

  PUBLIC EDUCATION IN BELGIUM. 161 
ELEMENTARY INSTRUCTION. 
Detailed view.—The system of elementary instruction in Belgium has 
special interest for the student of public policies. Its history illustrates 
in a striking manner the opposite tendencies of national and of local 
authority and the adverse influence of party politics as a factor in pop- 
ular education. Moreover it affords valuable lessons with respect to a 
problem of deep and widespread interest, namely, that of religious 
instruction in public schools. 
The development and present status of the system will be best under- 
stood in the light of its origin and of the successive laws which have 
controlled its operations. 
Historie antecedents.—The history of the modern Kingdom of Belgium 
begins with its separation from the Netherlands in 1830. The principal 
provinces comprised within the new Kingdom had long been distin- 
guished by their generous support of the arts and sciences, not only so, 
but popular education had been fostered in their midst by both chureh 
and secular agencies. It is a matter of record that as early as 1192 the 
citizens of Gand (Ghent) had secured from the court of Flanders a 
stipulation that ‘whoever had the will, capacity, and means” should 
be permitted to open a school in Gand, without opposition. Similar 
concessions were obtained by other towns, notably Ypres, Antwerp, 
and Brussels. Thus, in continental Europe, as we have seen formerly 
in Scotiand,' the rise of popular education can be traced back to the 
awakening of the sense of civic responsibility, antedating in truth the 
Protestant Reformation which is often regarded as its source. 
Evidently, then, for a full understanding of this interest as it is main- 
tained to-day in Belgium or elsewhere, it is necessary to know the his- 
tory of civic life and growth, the origin and spread and concentration 
of the arts and industries which have bound men together in industrial 
brotherhoods and communities, emancipated human thought, and quick- 
ened and multiplied human activities. It is necessary, moreover, to 
know the history of scholastic institutions, the ancient prototypes of 
existing schools and universities, a study for which Belgium affords 
rich and varied material, illustrating the spirit of every power that has 
contended for supremacy in western Europe from the days of Charle- 
magne to the modern era.” 
No such study is here contemplated; it must suffice to note that the 
Kingdom began its existence when popular education had become a 
subject of national interest in all the adjacent States. In Holland, 
during the period of the final union with Belgium (1815-1830), attention 
had been specially directed to details of school management and con- 
trol. The law passed just prior to the union (1806) had imparted to the

schools of the northern division a certain form of organization by the 
system of inspection which it provided, and higher standards by requir- 
ing all primary teachers to secure a professional diploma. Although 
during the union Belgium resisted the efforts of the Government to 
modify its own institutions, the influence of this law was felt after the 
separation. The influence of Protestant Holland fostered also the spirit 
of local independence which is deeply inwrought into Belgium polities. 
Initial measures.—The subject of popular instruction was earnestly 
discussed in the National Congress that framed the constitution of 
Belgium (adopted February 7, 1831), and the conflict of opposite par- 
ties was allayed for the time by a provision that gave equal recognition 
toall. “Instruction,” says article 17 of the constitution, ‘‘is free, all 
prohibitory measures are forbidden; the suppression of abuses is regu- 
lated solely by law. Public instruction given at the cost of the State 
is equally regulated by law.” 
From 1830 to 1842 primary education was left to the free initiative of 
individuals and communes. Between party contentions and local apa- 
thy the cause languished, and the need of a specific law on the subject 
became apparent. 
Law organizing primary instruction, 1842.—The movement that was 
going on in France under the guidance of Guizot, Cousin, Rendu, and 
others was followed with deep interest by Belgian statesmen, and in 
1842 a law organizing primary instruction was secured similar in its 
principal provisions to ‘Guizot’s law of 1833,” which laid the founda- 
tion of the present system of primary instruction in France. The Bel- 
gian law, an analysis of which will be found in acitation from de Laveleye 
(pp. 192-4), made provision for the elementary instruction of all children 
in inspected schools, either public or private, and the gratuitous instruc- 
tion of poor children, specified the branches of a limited obligatory pro- 
gramme, authorized inspection by the state and the church, the former 
confined to secular matters, fixed a minimum salary for teachers (200 
franes per annum), and emphasized the importance of their training by 
the provisions as to normal schools. 
On the whole, the law favored the ascendency of the clergy; they 
not only had the rights of inspection, but religious instruction, which 
was inscribed at the head of the programmes, was to be given under 
their auspices. Rights of conscience were, however, secured by the 
exemption of children from the religious lessons, who did not belong to 
the communion of the majority. 
The law was regarded as a compromise between the Liberal party, 
who desired a system of secular instruction under State control, and 
the clericals, who were opposed to all State interference in scholastic 
matters. The motives which lead to its adoption are set forth in the 
exposition by M. de Laveleye already referred to. They reduce in 
fact to this, that the clergy were in possession of nearly all the agencies

for education existing at the time the measure was adopted. Asacom- 
promise, the law was subject to repeated attacks from both parties, but 
it remained in force till 1878, when the Liberal party gained the ascend- 
ancy in the two houses. 
Law of 1879.—One of the first acts of the new legislature was the 
creation (August 19, 1878) of a ministry of public instruction. A law 
reorganizing the system of primary instruction followed July 1, 1879. 
The particulars in which it departed radically from the previous law 
were as follows: Every commune was obliged to maintain at least one 
public school, the actual number to be determined in each case by the 
Government. (As under the previous law, however, two or more com- 
munes might be authorized to unite together for the maintenance of a 
single school.) Moreover the State could oblige the commune to 
establish also an infant anes and a school for adults. 
The ecclesiastical inspection of schools was abolished; teachers must 
be native Belgians and furnished either with the diploma of a teacher 
or of a professor in the lower order of secondary schools. It was for- 
bidden to employ as teachers members of a religious order. The pro- 
gramme?! of obligatory subjects was greatly extended and religious 
instruction was excluded. This was to be left to the care of the family 
and the churches, excepting that ministers might be allowed the use of 
@ room in the school building to give religious instruction to the chil- 
dren of their respective communions attending the school, before or 
after the school session. 
For cantonal inspectors appointed by the Government under advice 
of the provincial authorities, and serving without salary, the law sub- 
stituted two classes of inspectors, i. e., provincial inspectors appointed 
by the King and subordinate inspectors appointed by the central author- 
ity; all salaried officials responsible directly to the minister or to his rep- 
resentative. The right of the communes to control their own schools was 
respected by the new law. It determined, however, the manner in 
which this control should be exercised. Moreover, it created a special 
agency, school committees (comités scolaires), to keep watch over the 
schools. The members of these bodies were to be appointed by the com- 
munal council, excepting where several communes had united to main- 
tain a school, when the appointment went to the minister of public 
instruction. The minimum salary of teachers was raised to 1,000 
francs—the number of State normal schools was raised from 6 to 12. 
In brief, the Liberal programme called for a system of secular schools 
under the surveillance of the State. The measure was heartily approved 
in the chief cities, which were the stronghold of the Liberal party, but 
excited intense opposition from the Catholic clergy, whose influence 
was supreme in the rural regions. Subsequent decrees, especially those 
of December, 1883, determining the amount which each commune must

raise for the support of public schools, increased the opposition, and 
the clerical party having recovered control of the Government in 1884, 
almost their first concern was to change the system of public instruction. 
Reactionary measures.—As a preliminary measure, the ministry of 
public instruction was abolished and the duties of the same restored to 
the ministry of the interior, whose chief assumed the double title, i. e., 
minister of the interior and of public instruction. The law of 1879 was 
annulled and a new law passed (September 20, 1884), which is still in 
force. The law is a return, substantially, to the policy of 1842, but 
with modifications which show that some permanent changes had been 
wrought in popular sentiment by the measures adopted under the Lib- 
eral party. The chief provisions of the law will be found in fullin the 
appendix to this article.| Here are noted only the particulars in which 
it.differs essentially from the previous laws or by which its spirit is 
most clearly illustrated, together with the statistical evidence of their 
enforcement. 
As regards schools, the law gives equal recognition to public (com- 
munal) and subsidized private schools (articles 1 and 9). The powers 
of the communes with respect to the establishment and direction of 
schools are more explicitly stated than in the previous laws, and the 
establishment of infant and adult schools made optional (article 2). 
Statistics show that at the close of 1890 there were 4,097 communal 
primary schools and 1,576 subsidized under State inspection. During 
the triennial period 1887-1890 the privilege of adopting schools had 
been sought by 250 communes, and 9 had obtained permission to unite 
with other communes in the support of a school. Of infant schools 
there were 686 communal and 456 subsidized private, and of schools 
for adults 1,603 communal and 142 subsidized. 
The obligatory programme is much abridged as compared with that 
of 1879, although not reduced to the meager limits of the earliest law. 
Religion is not included, but the communes are authorized to inscribe it 
at the head of the programme, children of dissenters being allowed to 
withdraw from the exercise. If upon the demand of twenty heads of 
families having children of school age the commune refuse to include 
religion in the programme, the Government, at the request of the 
parents, may adopt one or more private schools which afford the 
instruction and fulfill specified conditions (article 4). 
Since the passage of the law 26 schools have been thus adopted, of 
which 22 were still maintained at the close of 1890. These schools 
received about $23,000, as an annual allowance from the State for the 
instruction of indigent children. 
The appointment and control of teachers is confided to the communal 
council, which determines also the amount of the salary (article 17). 
Naturalized as well as native Belgians may be appointed (article 8). 
State inspection can not extend to religious struction, and the local

school committees created by the law of 1879 are discontinued (arti- 
cle 10). : 
The law of 1842 called for 2 normal schools to be founded and main- 
tained by the State, and normal departments in the 5 State high schools 
(écoles primaires supérieures de Etat) (Sec. IV, article 35). By a ~ 
law of May 29, 1866, 4 new State normal schools (2 for each sex) were 
authorized. Private normal schools also from the first received official 
recognition. The law of 1879 raised the number of State normal schools 
from 6 to 12 (Sec. IV, article 41). The law of 1884 simply authorizes 
the State, the provinces, and the communes to establish normal schools 
(article 11), leaving the number to be determined by circumstances. 
It is provided further that private normal schools may receive subsi- 
dies from public funds provided that they submit to State inspection 
(article 13). 
At the close of the last biennial period there were 13 State normal 
schools and departments (i. ¢., 7 for men, 6 for women) and 34 subsi- 
dized private normal schools (11 for men, 23 for women). 
The right of the communes to manage their.own schools has never 
been questioned. As a legal provision, it antedates all school legisla- 
tion in Belgium since the law of March 30, 1836, organizing the com- 
munes, confided the right “to administer, direct, and supervise all 
communal institutions to the collége des bourgmestre et échevins” (a 
body resembling somewhat a board of aldermen in our own cities). 
Public education, however, has another aspect than the narrow com- 
munal one; it is a matter also of national concern. This fact was 
recognized in the law of 1842 by the provision of State funds for the 
work, and of State inspection for all schools participating in the same. 
It was by increasing the authority of the central administration that 
the Liberals sought to raise the level and to deepen the results of pri- 
mary education even in the most apathetic communes. They failed in 
their broad purpose. Nevertheless, in the chief cities, which are the 
strongholds of their party, their work endures by virtue of the inde- 
pendence of the communes, which the law of 1884 does not abridge. 
Moreover, the obligatory programme introduced by the Liberals! raised 
an ideal of popular education not easily destroyed in progressive com- 
munities. Undoubtedly, too, it had the effect of keeping the obligatory 
programme of 1884 above the level of that of 1842. 
Under present conditions the Central Government simply maintains 
an inspection with reference to the very easy conditions required for 
obtaining the public appropriation. These are sufficient school accom- 
modation, approved buildings, and the maintenance of the obligatory 
programme. The reports show, however, as we shall see, that the last 
condition is not strictly enforced. Primarily the commune must bear 
the cost of elementary education. The State and the province grant 
subsidies only when the commune has contributed a sum equal at least

    166 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
to the proceeds of 4 centimes additional to the direct tax. Since, how- 
ever, the poorest communes may receive extra assistance, the Govern- 
ment appropriation is seldom forfeited. 
Practically, at present, the control of the schools, excepting in the 
chief cities, rests with the Catholic clergy. 
Official statistics, which in accordance with the requirements of the 
three laws here reviewed have been elaborately compiled from the date 
of the organization of the system, afford abundant data as to its gen- 
eral workings. The following particulars are from the latest report, 
which brings the record to 1891: 
School attendance-—On the 30th of December, 1890, the communal 
primary schools (for children 6 to 13 years of age) were attended by 
440,646 pupils, and the subsidized primaries by 175,395, or a total attend- 
ance of 616,041, about 10 per cent of the population (census 1890). 
The attendance upon infant schools, 113,172; upon schools for special 
classes (i. e., deaf mutes and blind, orphans, ete.), in charge of the min- 
ister of justice, 7,407; adult schools, 67,675, and the elementary depart- 
ments of secondary schools, 11,737, raises the above total to 816,032, or 
13 per cent of the population in attendance upon elementary instrue- 
tion. Of the pupils in communal elementary schools 90 per cent 
(396,235) received free instruction, and of those in subsidized private 
schools 80 per cent (141,532), or, combining the two classes, 87 per cent 
of pupils in elementary schools under free instruction. 
On behalf of these, payment is made by the boards of charity at a 
rate determined by the provincial authorities (permanent deputation) 
subject to the approval of the King. The amount contributed from this 
source in 1890 was $89,810; the amount received iu tuition fees on 
behalf of paying pupils was $132,103, The fee per pupil ranges from 
$1.18 to $4.70 per annum. 
Duration of school period.—In accordance with the official regula- 
tions the primary schools should bein session 240 days inthe year. Asa 
general rule a school day is from 44 to 6 hours, including the intermis- 
sion between morning and afternoon classes. In 1890 the communal 
primary schools were open on an average 235 days and the subsidized 
schools 236. The average number of days’ attendance for each pupil 
was, in the public schools, 178 days for the free pupils and 188 for the 
pay, and in the subsidized schools 184 and 196 days, respectively. 
Complaints are made by the inspector of these low averages, which are 
attributed in the main, to the inability of the teachers to interest pupils 
or to the indifference of parents in the matter. 
The early age at which pupils leave school is another evil upon which 
the inspectors dwell. Of 81,166 pupils who left the communal schools 
in 1889-90 without intending to return, only 17,268, or 21,28 per cent, 
had completed the course of study. In the subsidized schools the pro- 
portion was still lower, i. e., 19.07 per cent (5,816 upon a total of 30,491). 
It is noted also that the number leaving was very nearly 18 per cent of 
the entire attendance upon the schools.

Programme maintained.—The new programme includes seven ele- 
mentary subjects besides the three R’s. The number of schools omit- 
ting any of these subjects is carefully reported each year. In 1890 
the showing on a total of 5,673 public and subsidized schools was as 
follows:

  In this particular there has been noticeable improvement since 1887, 
A fair proportion of schools maintain optional branches in addition 
to the full obligatory programme. These are called schools with 
developed programmes (écoles primaires 4 programme développé). Their 
number and the optional branches they offered in 1890 are as follows:

An annual public examination (concours) of the higher classes of 
primary schools is held, in which all communal and subsidized primary 
schools must participate (article 10 of the school law). The number 
of pupils taking part in the exercise increases a little year by year, 
reaching a total of 16,763 in 1890. Of these, 12,374 were from public, 
2,759 from subsidized private, and 1,650 from uninspected private 
schools. The proportions of pupils from the three classes of schools 
securing the certificate of capacity were, respectively, 71.76, 56.30, and 
78.36 per cent. 
Teachers.—The teaching force of public primary schools, as reported 
December 31, 1890, numbered 5,438 men and 3,153 women, or a total of 
8,591. The corresponding totals for the subsidized primaries were, 
men, 1,189; women, 2,015; or altogether, 3,204. In the schools for both 
sexes men and women teachers are employed without distinction. The 
former, however, are more numerous. Only women are employed in 
girls’ schools, as is the case also in infant schools. Of the teachers in 
the public primary schools only 3.83 per cent were without diplomas, 
and of those in the subsidized primaries 33.46 per cent. 
The average salaries in the public schools were, for masters, $323; for 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  168 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
assistant masters, $305; for mistresses, $314.94; for assistants, $289. 
The averages have declined slightly during the triennial period. Of 
the public school masters 718 pursued some additional calling, and of 
those in subsidized schools 303. . It should be added that communal 
teachers are generally provided with lodging or its equivalent at the 
cost of the commune. 
The substitution of parochial for public schools allowed under the 
present law has left many teachers without positions (en disponibilité). 
Teachers thus deprived of service are allowed a salary not less than 
one-half the salary withdrawn, nor in any case less than 750 franes 
($150). The communal councils determine the amount and duration of 
this allowance (traitement d’attente); the time counts in calculating 
pensions. Teachers absent from their post by reason of sickness also 
receive a portion of their salaries. 
The statistics show that on December 31, 1890, under the first provi- 
sion, 752 teachers were receiving salaries to the total annual amount 
of $161,053, and 76 teachers unable to attend to their duties, a total 
amount of $21,518. Pedagogical conferences are held every quar- 
ter in each canton and under: the direction of the cantonal inspector, 
attendance upon the same being obligatory for all communal teachers; 
teachers in the subsidized schools are free to attend or not, and the 
same freedom is accorded the teachers of all infant schools. In 1890, 
the number of conferences reported was 1,503 (i. e., for masters, 790; 
for mistresses, 589; for infant school teachers, 124). As there are 319 
cantons it appears that inspectors even exceed the requirements of the 
law in respect to this part of their duties. 
The attendances upon the conferences for teachers of communal 
schools were 5,059, 2,874, and 1,178, respectively. The correspond. 
ing figures for the subsidized schools are 223, 259, and 7, respectively 
The Government also maintains normal courses corresponding to our 
teachers’ institutes. These are in session during the long vacations. 
The influence of these conferences and summer courses is increased. 
in many places by the pedagogical museums. These afford suitable 
halls for the conferences, while the collections of illustrative material 
add greatly to the effect of the practical teaching exercises that are a 
feature of the proceedings. Three such museums are maintained at 
Brussels (Province of Brabant) and two in each of the eight remain- 
ing provinces. Teachers also have the benefits of the National School 
Museum (Musée Scolaire National) at Brussels, an institution similar in 
its objects to the Musée Pédagogique at Paris. Models of school furni- 
ture and school apparatus and a fine library are included in the collec- 
tions of the national museum. All the material is admirably classified 
and arranged in the new buildings, first occupied in 1890. Exhibition 
_of school work are made here annually, lectures delivered, and confer- 
ences maintained on subjects of interest to teachers. 
In this connection mention should be made of the Belgian teachers

association (Fédération générale des instituteurs belges). It was 
organized in 1869, and has been a powerful means of stimulating zeal — 
and extending professional knowledge among the Belgian public 
school teachers. 
The civic decorations for teachers, instituted July 21, 1867, are an 
incentive to efficient and continuous service. These awards are of 
four classes—the civic cross, first and second class, and civic medal, first 
and second class. Altogether 56 decorations were conferred in 1890, 
Pensions.—Teachers have the right to a pension upon the same terms 
as persons in other branches of the civil service. The amount of the 
pension is calculated at the rate of one fifty-fifth of the average salary 
for the last five years of actual service. Upon this calculation the 
pension ranges from $200 to $400 annually. The State, the communes, 
and the provinces bear the expense, the first two contributing each two- 
fifths, the last one-fifth of the amount. The number of teachers on the 
pension list December 31, 1890, was 1,644, and their combined pensions 
1,725,170 francs (about $345,034). 
A fund is also maintained by the State, provinces, and communes for 
the widows and orphans of communal teachers, to which fund teachers 
desiring its benefits for their families must contribute annually 3 or 4 
per cent of their salaries. In 1890 the amount paid from this fund was 
525,704 frances ($105,141). 
Normal schools.—In 1890 the 13 State normal schools and depart- 
ments ! were attended by 711 students and employed a teaching force 
of 205 teachers and officers. The 34 subsidized private normals were 
attended by 1,805 students. 
‘With few exceptions the normal schools have boarding departments. 
Promising students, whose parents are too poor to meet the charges, 
may obtain the aid of the scholarships maintained by the State, the 
provinces, and the communes. In 1890 the number of scholarships 
provided in the State schools was 1,130, representing a money value of 
$23,845, and in the subsidized normals 1,536, having a money value of 
$29,634. 
The course of the State normal schools is arranged for three years, 
and includes the foll< wing obligatory branches: Moral precepts, elemen- 
tary notions of the constitutional and administrative institutions of 
the country, and also of primary school legislation, theory and practice 
of education; the mother tongue (grammar and literature), a second 
language (French, Flemish, or German, according to local demands) ; 
arithmetic, theoretic and practical, together with the complete system 
of legal weights and measures; geography, and particularly that of Bel- 
gium; outlines of general history and the detailed history of Belgium, 
notions of agriculture in the schools for men, and needlework in those 
1 The State normal schools for men are Gand, Lierre, Mons, Nivelles, Verviers, the 
normal departments Couvin, Huy. For women the schools are Bruges, Liege, and 
Tournai; departments, Andenne, Arlon, and Brussels.  
-P-A-G-E-180

  for women; writing, drawing, vocal music, gymnastics. All the above 
enumerated branches are included in the examination for a Government 
diploma, There are besides optional branches, as follows: 
In the schools for men, algebra, geometry, natural sciences, natural 
history, physics and chemistry, elements of hygiene, bookkeeping. 
In the schools for women, geometric forms, elements of natural 
science, natural history and physics, elements of hygiene, bookkeeping, 
elements of domestic economy and gardening. A third language may 
be taken in any of the schools. 
In State normal schools the training is eminently professional, theory 
is supplemented by practice, for which purpose 11 of the normals have 
attached to them model elementary schools (écoles d’application). 
Pupils are not admitted to training under 16 years of age nor above 
23. They must pledge themselves to teach in the public schools three 
years after graduation. The internal conduct of the schools, the staff- 
ing, examinations, etc., are regulated by the minister. 
Teachers’ libraries are also maintained in several communes either 
wholly or in part by public funds. It appears from the report that at 
the date, December 31, 1890, there were 191 of these libraries, compris- 
ing 130,357 volumes. ‘The number of volumes taken for home reading 
during the triennial period 1887-1890 was 25,669, and the number of 
teachers borrowing books 9,781. Complaint is made that so few teach- 
ers appreciate the advantages thus offered, but improvement is noticed 
in this respect. 
State inspection.—For the service of State inspection there are 18 
principal inspectors and 80 cantonal inspectors. The former receive 
salaries varying from $1,000 to $1,500; the latter from $600 to $900; 
traveling expenses are also allowed. The majority of district inspectors 
are chosen from the ranks of successful teachers; the principal inspec- 
tors are either promoted from the district inspectorship or were formerly 
professors in normal or secondary schools. From the report it appears 
that the district inspectors are careful to meet the requirements of an 
annual visit to each school in their respective districts. In 1890, on a 
total of 5,673 schools, 4,128 had been visited more than once, and 1,454 
once only. In addition 1,102 infant schools had been visited out of a 
total of 1,146, and 750 adult schools on a total of 1,749. The number 
of conferences conducted by these officials has already been given. The 
chief duties of the principal inspectors are advisory and the preparation 
of reports which are based upon those of the subordinate inspectors. 
The number of visits made by them to individual schools in 1890 was 
2,480, at which rate they would fully meet the requirement of a visit to 
each school once in two years. 
Finances.—The cost of maintaining the entire system of elementary 
instruction, including ordinary and extraordinary expenditures, in 
1890, was 28,898,679 francs, or about $5,779,000. Of this amount the 
communes contributed 44.2 per cent; the provinces, 6 per cent; the
-P-A-G-E-181
PUBLIC EDUCATION IN BELGIUM. 171 
  State, 41 per cent; school fees, 5 per cent; boards of charity, 2 per cent. 
The small remainder came from donations, balances, ete. 
Effects of changing policies—A school system left so largely to local 
influences as that of Belgium will necessarily present widely different 
degrees of efficiency and development in different localities. These 
differences, which exist in all countries, have presumably been intensi- 
fied in Belgium, where elementary education, as we have seen, has 
been particularly subject to political influences. 
The changes from national to local supremacy and frem secular to 
sectarian management have not been accomplished without great ex- 
citement and bitter party recriminations. 
While the law of 1879 was in force the Clericals accused their oppo- 
nents of forcing communes to support schools which they did not want. 
The Liberals now retort that the people are kept from attending the 
schools they prefer by threats of excommunication and appeals to 
superstitious fears, Certain itis that under the law of 1879 Clerical 
schools had to live in spite of the Government, and equally certain that 
under the law of 1884 large numbers of public communal schools have 
been closed and their teachers deprived of employment. Official sta- 
tistics, which have been systematically reported since 1836, confirm 
these statements. For comparison, it suffices to select the years which 
mark, respectively, the close of the period under the law of 1842, and 
that under the Liberal law (i. e., 1878, 1883), and also 1890, the latest 
year of report. The changes from period to period are indicated in the 
statistics of enrollment in communal and adopted schools (private

The fluctuation in the teaching body is the most significant fact 
brought out in the above showing. Under the law of 1879 the teachers 
belonging to religious denominations were practically eliminated from 
the communal schools. They were free, however, to continue their work 
in the church schools, which received nothing from public funds. That 
this was their course is apparent from the decline in public school 
enrollment, for it is scarcely to be supposed that the children withdrawn 
from these left school altogether. Under the new law the religious 
teachers are being rapidly restored and church schools adopted in the

  172 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
place of nonsectarian communal schools, which are consequently sup- 
pressed. The extent of these changes is indicated by the following 
statistics, quoted by M. Barain the Chamber of Representatives during 
the discussion of the educational appropriations for 1894. Said this 
member: 
You have suppressed 877 primary schools, 228 infant schools (écoles gardiennes), 
and 1,079 schools for adults, a total of 2,184 public schools, with 44,987 scholars. 
You have struck the teachers in a manner incredible: 1,047 teachers have been 
placed on the roll of those awaiting engagements ata reduced salary ; 1,500 received 
nothing. You have decreased the salary of 3,316 teachers. I cite this from official 
returns. To-day it is proposed to give a part of the appropriation to private 
education. 
Consider the situation of France, which has six times as many inhabitants as 
Belgium. 
There are in France 66,340 primary public schools. We have but 5,000 schools, 
one-thirteenth the number in France. The schools of the latter are attended by 
4,400,000 scholars, ours by 433,000, not even one-tenth. Belgium has an appropria- 
tion of 7,400,000 francs; France has twenty-two times as much for a population 
which is only six times as large as ours. 
In future we shall pay for this inferiority of our population as compared with 
that of France. Where suffrage is universal it is necessary that everybody should 
be educated. 
We may add that actually, after ten years waiting, there are more than 580 teach- 
ers without employment because their places have been declared vacant (en dis- 
ponibilité). 
It should be noted that the school attendance quoted above is in 
public schools only and the funds specified are the State appropriations. 
The attendance in adopted or subsidized schools raises the total attend- 
ance to 616,041, and local appropriations (provincial and communal) 
raise the public funds devoted to primary education to a total of 
19,840,280 frances ($3,870,877). 
That these changes in the school system have interfered with the 
true purposes of elementary education seems evident also from the 
degree of illiteracy prevailing in Belgium. The census of 1890 gives 
38 per cent as the proportion of illiterates in the entire Kingdom, or by- 
sex, 36 per cent of men and 40 per cent of women, 
In the discussion of a table showing the distribution of illiterates by 
sex and age, the reporter says: 
In examining this table it is impossible to ignore the fact that among the children 
8 to 15 years of age nearly 224 per cent are still illiterate. The proportion was 25 
per cent in 1880 and fell then to 20 per cent for those from 15 to 25 years. To-day 
the latter show only 15 per cent of illiterates. The actual gain in the proportion of 
persons between 15 and 25 years of age able to read and write has thus been 74 
per cent during the last ten years.' It is among the persons of this age that instruc- 
tion is most diffused. For those above 25 years of age the statistics show a con- 
stant decrease in the number of literates. This is true both of the census of 1880 
and of 1890. The diminution varies from 3 to 4 per cent for each quinquennial 
period. (Census 1890, vol. 1, pp. XLII, XLIII.) 
  
1The tables show an increase of 17.3 per cent in the total population 15 to 25 years 
of age in the decade 1880-1890, and an increase of 25 per cent in the proportion able 
to read and write, or a gain in the latter of 7.5 per cent.

  Auxiliary agencies.—Belgium is par excellence a country of benefici- 
ary associations and of public charities, and it naturally follows that 
the needs of poor children are carefully looked after. 
The boards of charity, which are organized on a legal basis in each 
commune, help, as we have seen, in defraying the cost of elementary 
education. In a great many places they also give assistance to desti- 
tute families. There are very few vagrant children in the Kingdom. 
The school savings bank has been fostered as a means of inculeating 
thrift, but at the present time the general sentiment of teachers seems 
to be opposed to the system. The official report states that— 
The savings bank is not fostered in the subsidized schools for adults and for 
infants, and has little development in the subsidized primary schools. As to com- 
munal or public schools, the savings bank works well in the primary grades, but 
has little success in the infant schools and schools for adults. % 
The total investments made by pupils of the primary schools in 1890 
amounted to $721,856, of which $45,227 only were from pupils of the 
subsidized schools. 
School colonies or vacation schools for the poor children, which origi- 
nated in Zurich in 1876, flourish in Brussels and several other cities of 
Belgium. Their purpose is to afford the poorest children of the great 
cities a brief sojourn in the country during the heated season, with the 
chance for useful and healthful training at the same time. The first 
experiment in this direction in Belgium was made in 1886 by Dr. Kops, 
communal councilor at Brussels. He endeavored at the outset to 
form a private society, composed of Catholics and Liberals, for the sup- 
port of the undertaking. Failing in this he appealed to the munici- 
pal authorities for aid. The response was immediate. From that time 
school colonies made rapid progress in Belgium. Brussels, the capital, 
took the lead; the cities of Litge, Verviers, Anvers, aud Gand were not 
far behind. Two large philanthropic societies of Brussels, the Progrés 
and the Marcunvins, have sustained the work with great zeal—the first, 
since 1888; the second, since 1892. They are aided in their generous 
efforts by private initiative, and by subsidies from the city itself. The 
latter also every year organizes colonies on its own account. 
The following statistics summarize the work at Brussels:

174 EDUCATION: REPORT, 1892-93. 
INTERMEDIATE INSTRUCTION. 
  Intermediate instruction (enseignement moyen) is the term applied 
in Belgium to that part of instruction which lies between the primary 
schools, whose age limit is 14 years, and university education, upon 
which students enter at 18 or 19 years of age. Historically the insti- 
tutions for intermediate instruction are distinct from the primary 
schools, and the distinction 1s maintained in their public administra- 
tion. Between the two classes of institutions, however, a relation is 
established by means of public and private scholarships awarded gen- 
erally upon competitive examination. 
Classification of State schools.—The public distepanedints schools are of 
two classes, those supported by the Government and those maintained 
by the communes. 
The Government schools are of two grades—the royal athénées or 
higher intermediate schools, whose courses comprise seven years, and 
the lower intermediate schools of three years. The latter include what 
were formerly termed superior primary schools, and also the industrial 
and commercial schools. The royal athénées are for boys only; the 
lower intermediate include schools for boys and also for girls. 
Number of schools and enrollment in the same.—By the law of Sep- 
tember 20,1884, the number of athénées is fixed at20. The province of 
Hainaut has 5, Brabant and Litge each 3, Anvers, occidental Flanders, 
and Limbourg each 2, and the remaining provinces, i. e., oriental 
Flanders, Luxembourg, and Namur, 1 each. As shown in the table 
(p. 160), the athénées were attended in 1890 by 5,726 pupils. Of these, 
1,751 were admitted gratuitously and 1,109 at a reduced fee. The full 
fee differs in the several athénées and also in the different sections of 
each, the lowest fee being 20 francs ($4) and the highest 120 franes ($24) 
per annum. Lower intermediate schools (6coles moyennes inférieures) 
can not exceed 100 for boys and 50 for girls. (Law of September 20, 
1884.) Actually in 1890 there were 79 schools of this class for boys, 
attended by 12,475 pupils, of whom 4,537 were admitted gratuitously 
and 3,487 at reduced rates. The annual fee varies in these schools 
also, the highest being 72 francs ($14.40) per annum and the lowest (pre- 
paratory section) 6 frances ($1.20). 
The number of this class of schools for girls in 1890 was 36, attended. 
by 5,721 pupils, 1,367 under free instruction and 1,528 at reduced rates, 
and the remainder paying full fees, which ranged ‘tr ‘om 14 franes ($2.80) 
to 120 franes ($24) per annum. . 
Support and control.—The towns in which these State schools are 
situated generally give the buildings, and the State appropriation cov- 
ers the excess of the current expenditure above the receipts from fees. 
Both grades of schools are controlled by the Government in accord- 
ance with the law of June 1, 1850, subsequent modifying laws, and 
royal decrees.
-P-A-G-E-185
PUBLIC EDUCATION IN BELGIUM. 175 
  Teachers—classification and salaries.—The teaching force in the athé- 
nées consists of a prefect of studies, professors, and masters (surveil- 
Jants); in the lower intermediate schools of a director (in schools for 
girls a directress), regents, and teachers, The prefects, professors, 
directors, and regents are appointed by the King, the masters and 
teachers by the minister. The prefects and professors of the athénées 
must have a doctor’s degree. The regents and teachers of the lower 
schools must have the diploma of a professor agrégé, which is obtained 
by a rigid examination before a special committee, or for the lowest 
positions the diploma of a primary teacher. A special diploma (dipléme 
Winstitutrice) is instituted for the directresses and teachers of the sec- 
ondary schools for girls. 
The salaries are fixed as follows:

The professors of the State secondary schools have the right to a 
pension. 
Communal schools—The communal schools either receive a subsidy 
from the Government, in return for which they must admit a certain 
number of free students, or are maintained wholly by the communes. 
Of the former there are eight for boys and four for girls. They must 
conform to Government regulations in respect to programmes, text- 
books, and the appointment of professors. 
The attendance upon the communal schools, subsidized and exclu- 
sively communal, raises the total number of students in public inter- 
mediate schools to 28,428, of whom 11,737 were in preparatory classes, 
Examinations and diplomas.—The athénées oceupy about the same 
position in the Belgian system of education as the lycées do in the 
French system or the gymnasia in the German. Students who com- 
plete the course and pass the final examinations before a committee 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
176 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  appointed by the Government receive a diploma (dipléme de sortie) 
which admits them to the universities. Students who complete the 
courses in the lower intermediate schools for either boys or girls and 
pass a final examination also receive a diploma. Annual competitive 
examinations (concours généraux) for distinctions (i. e., honorable men- 
tion and prizes) are held in which the students of the various classes 
of secondary schools participate. 
Special courses for professors.—In 1847 the Government created spe- 
cial pedagogical courses to prepare professors for the athénées, i. e., 
courses of humanities at Litge, and of science at Ghent. In 1852 
these courses were organized as special normal schools and so con- 
tinued until 1890, when they were merged into the universities—the 
former into the faculty of philosophy and letters, University of Liege; 
the latter into the faculties of science, University of Ghent. There 
still remain the normal courses for teachers of the lower secondary 
schools of the State, i.e., for teachers of boys’ schools at Ghent and 
Nivelles, and for teachers of girls’ schools at Brussels and Liége. 
Clerical schools.—Parallel with the public provision for intermediate 
or secondary education are the clerical schools, which are more numerous 
than the public schools. It is stated officially that salaries are higher 
in the former than in the latter, with the result of attracting the best 
teachers to the clerical schools. : 
Ourricula and programmes.—In Belgium, as in other countries, the 
question of classical versus scientific training has been earnestly dis- 
cussed ever since the organization of intermediate instruction (law of 
1850). On account of the freer spirit of the Belgian system the move- 
ment in favor of science and modern languages has had less opposition 
than in adjoining countries. A peculiar complication, however, has 
affected the movement in Belgium. Here the period of secondary 
study is shorter than in either France or Germany, i. e., five or six 
years,' as against nine or ten. This has made it difficult for students 
to reach the standard in classical studies that prevails on the conti- 
nent, and has operated also to the disadvantage of Belgian universi- - 
ties. The difficulties have necessarily been increased by the endeavor 
to provide for additional studies. Without entering into the details of 
the various adjustments attempted from time to time, it must suffice to 
present here the present organization and programmes of the royal 
athénées, the typical secondary schools of Belgium, as established by 
royal decree of August 5, 1888. 
The athénées are divided into three sections, as follows: 
Latin and Greek humanities. 
Latin humanities. 
Modern humanities, 
In each section the number of classes or years of study is seven. 
JAs determined by the requirements for admission to the degree examinations. 
See page 185.  
-P-A-G-E-187
  PUBLIC EDUCATION IN BELGIUM. 117 
The programme of the section of Latin and Greek humanities com- 
prises the following subjects: 
Religion, German, Natural sciences, 
Latin, English, Drawing, 
Greek, History, Writing, 
French, Geography, Music, 
Flemish, Mathematics, Gymnastics, 
Notions of the constitutional and administrative institutions of the country. 
The programme of the section of the Latin humanities is the same as 
the foregoing, with the exception that Greek is replaced by extra mathe- 
matics and science. 
The course in modern humanities is also the same, with the exception 
of Latin and Greek and the addition of commercial sciences. The last- 
named section is composed of a lower division, comprising four years’ 
study, and of two higher divisions, the scientific and the commercial 
and industrial, each composed of three classes. 
In the adaptation of these programmes to the different sections of 
Belgium, i. e., the French or Walloon, and the Flemish or Dutch, only 
the courses in modern language are varied. 
The following schemes show the number of hours a week assigned to 
each study in the athénées of the Walloon districts:

@ After troisiéme for mathematics and the second class for natural sciences, there is a bifurcation, and students may choose between the two series indicated in the programme, : 
The organization deereed in 1881, which is replaced by that of 1887, 
also comprised two distinct sections, i. e., section of humanities and 
the professional (industrial and commercial). The former included 
three parallel courses, one based upon Greek and Latin, the other two 
upon Latin without Greek. Of the two Latin courses, one was adapted 
to students who gave preference to mathematics and physics, the other 
to those who desired natural science, especially, as a preparation for 
the medical faculty. This attempt at extreme specialization is now 
abandoned. The apparent division of the classical course into two 
parallel courses is in reality nothing more than making Greek optional, 
students being allowed to substitute for this study extra mathematics 
and science. The new name given to the section which omits the 
classics, i. e., modern humanities, in place of professional, emphasizes 
the tendency to make it more truly a culture course than a technical 
course. 
The lower intermediate schools have been regarded both as schools 
preparatory to the athénées and as finishing schools for students 
obliged to enter early upon practical pursuits. Recent modifications 
have resulted in a programme more especially adapted to the latter 
purpose than heretofore. It is, however, permitted to the directors to 
modify the mucel course by introducing Latin for students who intend 
to enter the classical section of an athénée. The model course is as 
follows: :

Finances.—By reference to the table, page 160, it will be seen that 
the current expenditure for intermediate schools amounted in 1890 to 
$1,217,679. The income from all sources was $1,270,731, a slight excess 
over the current expenditure. Of this income the State furnished 53 
per cent, the communes 26 per cent, the provinces 0.7 per cent, and 
tuition fees 16.7 per cent, The small balance was from property, gifts, 
ete. The appropriation from the public treasury for administration 
and inspection services, for prizes, scholarships, training and examina- 
tions of professors, ete., not included in the above, amounted to about 
$81,000. SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
The universities and their origin.—The establishments for superior 
instruction in Belgium are the two State universities, Ghent in the 
Flemish section, and Litge in the French; the Independent University
-P-A-G-E-190
  180 / EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
of Brussels and the Catholic University of Louvain. The last named is 
the oldest seat of learning in Belgium, having been founded in 1426 by 
Jean IV, Duke of Brabant, Like the ancient universities of France, 
it was suppressed during the revolutionary period (October 25, 1797). 
It was temporarily reorganized in 1816, and finally in 1835. 
The faculties established at Brussels under the control of the 
Imperial University (1806) may be regarded as the beginning of the 
University of Brussels, although the university, as such, was not 
created until 1834, -In 1816, or the year following the union with the 
Netherlands, universities were founded at Ghent and Litge. 
The Government which was established in 1830 recognized, provi- 
sionally, the three universities existing at the time, i. e., Ghent, Liége, 
and Louvain. By a law of 1835 the two former were constituted State 
universities, their organization, conduct, and courses of study to be 
determined and their maintenance provided by the Government. The 
same law instituted examining juries, to be appointed by the King and 
the two chambers, for conferring academic degrees. From that time 
until 1876 the degree-conferring function remained detached from the 
universities. 
Constitution of State universities.—As constituted by the law of 1835 
each of the State universities comprises four faculties, i. e., of philosophy 
and letters, of science (mathematics, physics, and natural sciences), of 
law, and of medicine. In pursuance of the provision that the faculty 
of sciences at Ghent should offer the instruction necessary for the arts 
and manufactures, civil architecture, construction of roads and bridges, 
and the same faculty at Liége the instruction required for the arts and 
manufactures and mining industries, a school of civil engineers was 
attached to the former and a mining school to the latter. (Regulation 
of September 27, 1836.) 
From the promulgation of the law of 1835, the Government was 
actively engaged in the work of organizing and developing the State 
universities. In 1849 a second law was passed defining more specifically 
the organic character and the standards of these institutions. Subse- 
quent laws, especially that of 1890, have increased the authority of the 
universities by according them a representation in the examining 
juries, but their.constitution and scholastic functions remain substan- 
tially as determined by the law of 1849. 
Professors.—The teaching corps comprises professors, ordinary and 
extraordinary, appointed by the King. They must have a doctor’s 
degree and must devote themselves exclusively to their university 
duties. These duties, as also the privileges which professors enjoy, 
and the penalties to which they are subject, are prescribed by the law 
or by royal decrees. The annual salaries are 7,000 franes ($1,400) for 
extraordinary professors and 5,000 francs ($1,000) for ordinary, with a 
possible augmentation of from 1,000 to 3,000 francs ($200 to $600). Pro- 
fessors are retired as émérite, with an annual pension equal to the aver-
-P-A-G-E-191
  PUBLIC EDUCATION IN BELGIUM. 181. 
age salary of the last five years of service, when they reach their 
seventieth year, or if disabled by serious and permanent infirmity, 
The law allows for each university 13 professors in the sciences, 12 in 
philosophy, 10 in medicine, and 7 in law. In case of necessity one or 
two additional professors may be appointed in each faculty. (Law of 
July 15, 1849, art. 10, modified by laws of May 22, 1882, and May 22, 
1892.) In 1891 Ghent had a staff of 67 professors in the four faculties 
and 24 professors and teachers in the special schools; Liege, 68 pro- 
fessors in the faculties and 17 professors and teachers in the special 
schools. 
Special professors called agrégés are also assigned to each university 
in such numbers and for such courses as circumstances may demand. 
The conditions of the service have been the subject of many decrees. 
At present, aspirants must have a doctor’s degree and also a special 
diploma indicating high attainments in some distinct department of 
knowledge. 
The courses which the agrégés give are additional to the regular 
courses; they have no salaries, but may receive fees, and may be 
engaged in other pursuits, as law, medicine, etc. The agrégés, natu- 
rally, become candidates for vacant chairs, so that the service is in a 
sense a preparation for full professorships. There are also assistants 
for laboratory exercises and clinics. The professors and assistants, 
with the officers of administration, raised the personnel of the Univer- 
sity of Ghent to a total of 161 in 1891, and that of Liége to 188, 
. Officers of administration.—The official authorities of each university 
are the rector, the secretary, the deans of faculties, the academic council 
and the collége @’assesseurs. The rector is appointed by the King for 
a term of three years. He is the executive head of the university and 
has general charge of all its affairs. He may at his will convoke the 
collége d’assesseurs for advice. This body consists of the secretary 
of the academic council and the deans of faculties. The latter, as also 
the secretaries, are chosen by the professors themselves and are thus 
their direct representatives. The academic council consists of all the 
professors of a university who, in their collective capacity, determine the 
conduct of the scholastic affairs as the management of courses, time- 
tables, ete. 
Through these advisory functions the professors have really a voice 
in the administration of the universities. Their chief importance in 
this respect, however, lies in the fact that they are represented in the 
conseil de perfectionnement of superior instruction, which the minister 
must convoke at least once a month. The constitution of this council 
is as follows: Eight professors (one from each faculty of the universi- 
ties), the two rectors, the two Government inspectors (administrateurs- 
inspecteurs), and other members of the teaching profession chosen by 
the minister. This council gives advice upon all matters pertaining to 
superior instruction. It should be added that, while the rectors have
-P-A-G-E-192

general charge of students, the professors exercise disciplinary authority 
over those of their respective classes, and may even suspend a disor- 
derly student. 
Fees for students.—Students are received and enrolled by the rector, 
the fee for enrollment being 15 francs ($3). After this formality is 
completed, the student takes out a ticket for the studies of the courses 
he proposes to follow. The fee for the ticket is 250 franes ($59) in 
philosophy, literature, and law, and 200 franes ($40) in the other facul- 
ties. There are also fees for the use of laboratories, for clinics, ete., 
and extra fees for special lessons or courses. 
Lessons and courses.—Instruction is given in the French language, 
except by special dispensation from the minister. A lesson oceupies 
at least an hour. Courses must be so arranged that the student has 
not less than three hours of lessons each day, not comprising clinics 
and laboratory exercises. 
The minimum duration of the course is determined by the require- 
ments for degrees, which will be considered hereafter. 
Attendance upon the lessons is obligatory, and every three months 
the professors report to the rector students who fail in this obligation. 
Scholarships and prizes.—Students of ability who can not afford the 
expenses of university education may be assisted by scholarships 
(bourses), of which the State maintains 120, of the annual value of $89 
each. Study in foreign countries is promoted by traveling scholarships, 
21 in number, of the annual value of $400 each and available for two 
years. Competitive examination for the latter is open only to persons 
who have received the degree of doctor, of pharmacist, or of engineer. 
Annual competitive examinations (concours universitaire) are held, at 
which the successful contestants receive medals, accompanied with 
prizes of books or money amounting to $80 each. 
The universities of Brussels and Louvain have each the four faculties 
of the same order as those of the State universities, to which Louvain 
adds the faculty of theology. As shown in the table (p. 160), the eom- 
bined attendance upon the four universities in 1890-91 was 5,664, dis- 
tributed as follows:

Buildings and equipments.—Under the law of 1835 the task of furnish- 
ing suitable buildings for the State universities was left to the cities
-P-A-G-E-193
  PUBLIC EDUCATION IN BELGIUM. 183 
in which they were located. This obligation, willingly undertaken, in 
time proved too great a drain upon the resources of the cities. Their 
inability to’bear the burden alone was particularly manifest after the 
passage of the law of 1876, which greatly extended the scientific work 
of the universities. An official inquiry with respect to buildings and 
equipments resulted in a special State appropriation for these pur- 
poses amounting to $900,000, i. e., $550,000 for Litge, and the balance 
for Ghent. With this assistance the work of erecting new buildings” 
and of reconstructing or enlarging the old has been pushed with vigor. 
Among the most important of the new structures are the Institute of 
Sciences for the University of Ghent, completed in 1889, and the Insti- 
tute of Chemistry, University of Lidge. 
The triennial report, 1889-1891, which brings the statement to the 
end of the period, shows a total expenditure for the new constructions 
of $1,782,070, of which $293,445 had been expended during the three 
years epecniene 
Current income and expenditwres.—The State appropriation for supe- 
rior education amounted in 1891 to $435,154, upon which there was an 
expenditure of $427,374. This includes rane of administration and 
examinations, current expenditures, and the extraordinary expendi- 
tures, i. e., for buildings and equipments. 
The expenditure for salaries and for material for the two universities 
in 1891 was as follows: 
Salaries. ae

127, 691 Lidégo..! 
    
In addition to the State appropriations the two universities received 
about $4,400 from communal and provincial funds, of which a little 
more than half was for scholarships. The University of Brussels 
receives an annual allowance from the city and also from the Province 
of Brabant. The former amounted in 1891 to $12,320, and the latter to 
$4,000. 
Fees, which are the chief source of income for Brussels and Louvain, 
are the same as at the State universities. 
Degrees.—Until a recent date the distinctive feature of superior 
instruction in Belgium was the separation of the scholastic and the 
degree conferring functions. It is true that the law of 1835 authorized 
the universities to confer certain diplomas. They were, however, dis- 
tinctions merely, and carried no rights in the Kingdom. 
‘For description of the new buildings see report of the minister upon superior 
instruction, 1889-1891, Chap. II, pp. 34-46. See also an interesting monograph, 
“Esquisse Historique sur les Batiments Universitaires,” published by a committee 
of the students’ association of the University of Liege. i

  184 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93, 
As defined in a regulation of October 12, 1838, the university diplo- 
mas are of two orders—an honorary diploma delivered to persons 
(native or foreign) possessed of a doctor’s degree, and who shall have 
given proof of superior ability, and a scientific diploma conferred upon 
examination. Subsequently (1853) a special scientific diploma carry- 
ing the degree of doctor was created in the interest of persons who, 
after having obtained the legal diploma of doctor, should apply them. 
selves successfully to some scientific specialty. Subsequent legislation 
has not affected these diplomas. 
The authority to confer the legal degrees, without which no one can 
enter upon professional life in Belgium, was relegated, as we have seen, 
to a jury constituted by the legislative bodies, and necessarily subject 
to political and official influences. The separation was emphasized in 
1857, when the provisions relative to the examinations for degrees were 
detached from the law controlling superior instruction, and embodied 
in a distinctlaw. (Law May 17,1857.)! This policy has detracted from 
the honors and dignities of the universities, and in the opinion of many 
has prevented that disinterested pursuit of knowledge which is essen- 
tial to the highest results of university training. The advocates of a 
different policy gained a concession in 1876, when a tentative law was 
passed authorizing the universities (both State and free) to hold exam- 
inations for, and to confer degrees in like manner as the central jury, 
the decisions in all cases to be subject to confimation by a State com- 
mittee (commission d’entérinement). (Law of May 19, 1876.) 
Three years later (1879) a special inquiry was instituted to determine 
the manner in which the universities fulfilled the trust thus reposed in 
them. The investigation was maintained for four years and meanwhile 
the experiment authorized in 1876 was prolonged. The report of the 
investigation was so satisfactory that in 1886 a bill was submitted to 
the Chamber of Deputies by M. Thonissen, minister of the interior and 
of public instruction, with a view to giving permanent effect to the ten- 
tative essay of 1876. After prolonged examination and discussion, the 
project was adopted February 27, 1890. Henceforth the degree-confer- 
ring authorities are the four universities and a central jury in which the 
State universities and the free universities have equal representation. 
The degrees specified in the law are of two orders, called, respectively, 
candidate and doctor. 
The seven degrees of the inferior order are candidate in philosophy 
and letters; in law; in physical sciences; in medicine, surgery, and 
midwifery; notary; engineer. To each of the first five degrees enumer- 
ated corresponds a doctor’s degree. Of the same order are the degree 
of pharmacist, civil engineer of mines, civil engineer. The degree of 
candidate in philosophy and letters, corresponding very nearly to the

+ | 
bachelor’s degree in this country, is a prerequisite for the degree of 
candidate in law, and the degree of candidate in natural sciences, for 
that of candidate in medicine, surgery, and midwifery. Moreover no 
one can be admitted to the examinations for the lower degree in phi- 
losophy and letters or in natural sciences unless he produces the cer- 
tificate of intermediate studies, showing that he has pursued in the one 
case a course of classical study for at least six years, in the other case 
the modern secondary course for at least five years. In the absence of 
such certificates the aspirant must submit to a preliminary examina- 
tion. In general, the degree of candidate is a prerequisite for that ot 
doctor of the same order. 
The law fixes the conditions of admission to the examinations and 
the mode of conducting the same. A university may confer degrees 
only upon its own students. Before the degree conferred either by a 
university or the central jury can have any practical effect it must be 
confirmed by the special committee (commission d’entérinement), con- 
sisting of two councilors of the court of appeal (cours de cassation), 
two members of the Royal Academy of Medicine, two members of the 
section of sciences in the Royal Academy of Sciences, and two mem- 
bers of the section of fine arts, all appointed annually by royal decree. 
The provisions of the new law as. to the minimum number of years 
of study required of candidates for the several degrees, the number of 
examinations for each, and the subjects to be covered by each examina- 
tion are a significant index of the standards of liberal and professional 
training in Belgium. The full consideration of these particulars be- 
longs, however, rather to a discussion of higher education in and of 
itself considered than to a mere outline of the general system of edu- 
cation, such as is here attempted. The following tabulated particu- 
lars! complete the survey of the formal requirements for degrees:

  186 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
It is interesting to note that under the law of 1890 women are 
admitted to all academic degrees. By a provision of the previous law 
(May 20, 1876) the Government was authorized to determine the condi- 
tions under which women might practice medicine and. pharmacy. They 
ave, however, still denied admission to the bar. 
Scientific and literary academies, libraries, etc.—The interests of higher 
education are promoted by the great number of learned societies in 
which Belgium abounds, Among these are the Royal Medical Academy 
at Brussels, which receives an annual grant of $4,000 from the State, 
the Royal Academy of Science, Literature, and Art, also at Brussels, 
which receives annually $3,000 from the State, and the Royal Museum 
at Brussels for the State collections in natural history. Belgium has 
also many public libraries, the chief of which is the Royal Library at 
Brussels. The public libraries of Ghent, Liége, and Louvain are con- 
nected with the respective universities. These libraries are adminis- 
tered in a very liberal spirit; they are open daily for consultation and 
as a rule volumes are lent at the discretion of the librarians, 
The spirit and the conditions under which education is fostered in 
Belgium seem naturally to favor a movement like that of university 
extension. The University of Ghent has the credit of being the firstin 
the Continent of Europe to enter into this movement. Liége and Brus- 
sels were not slow to follow, and the work is now maintained by an 
association in which all three of the universities are represented. 
TECHNICAL AND INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS. 
The survey of the educational provision of Belgium would be incom- 
plete without some notice of the special schools of art and industry 
(enseignement spécial) for which Belgium is justly distinguished. Pro 
vision for this order of training antedates the present Government, and 
became the subject of debate and legislation soon after its organization. 
Industrial and technical schools are generally established by com- 
munal authorities or by private societies, but if subsidized by the 
State are under the general supervision of the minister of agriculturé, 
of industry, and of public works. They are classified as follows: 
Superior school of commerce at Antwerp (founded 1852); provincial 
school of Hainaut at Mons (1837); industrial schools; apprenticeship 
schools (ateliers d’apprentissage); professional schools and courses; 
schools of domestic economy, and housework for girls. The names of 
the first two and the last in the list sufficiently indicate their purpose. 
The industrial schools are characterized in official reports as schools 
intended “to give the workman scientific instruction which he is unable 
to obtain in the workshop; to procure for him the means of improy- 
ing his material condition and of developing his intelligence; to lead 
him gradually away from the tyranny of routine, and to merease the 
economic value of his labor, and thus to enable him to contribute to 
mcreased production for his own good and for the national benefit.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
  PUBLIC EDUCATION IN BELGIUM. 187 
These schools are supported mainly by Government and municipal 
grants. Tuition is free. The sessions are held generally in the even- 
ing and on Sunday morning, although several have also week day ses- 
sions. The courses are not uniform, being determined on the technical 
side by the requirements of local industries. The general course com- 
prises the French or Flemish language according to the geographical 
location of the schools; mathematics in its applications to industry; 
physics, theoretical and applied; chemistry, general and applied; me- 
chanies, hygiene, industrial economy, and drawing. The last named 
is the basis of the instruction. 
Pupils are admitted generally at 14 years of age (12 years at least). 
They must know how to read and write and the four rules of arithmetic. 
Apprenticeship schools (ateliers @apprentissage) had their origin in 
. Ghent, the first, established in 1817, having been intended for the benefit 
of indigent artisans. Founded at the time when the introduction of 
machinery was transforming all branches of the linen industry, the chief 
interest of the province, the new institution suggested the means of pre- 
paring artisans for the changed condition-of their work. As the result 
of a special investigation authorized by the Government in 1840, appren- 
ticeship schools were recognized as a legitimate object of communal and 
Statesupport. They were brought under State inspection in 1849. [tis 
in the Flemish provinces that this particular class of schools abounds, 
all but.1 of the 37 in operation in 1889 being distributed in these two 
divisions, i. e., 27 in West and 9 in East Flanders. 
The professional (technical) schools and courses include a number of 
highly developed apprenticeship schools of weaving in the Flemish 
provinces, and similar schools established in other provinces in the 
interest of specific industries, as telegraphy, printing, tailoring, car- 
pentry, ete. Technical schools for the benefit of young women have 
been established at Brussels, Antwerp, Mons, Verviers, and Ghent, and 
courses less extensive in a few small communes. These schools and 
courses combine an advanced course of instruction in the studies of 
the elementary schools, with special training in drawing and in some 
industry adapted to women, as decorative art, artificial flower work, 
cutting and fitting, ete. 
The schools of household industry for young girls are intended 
especially to prepare the daughters of workmen to manage their homes 
with thrift, order, and a due regard for sanitary requirements. The 
first establishment of the kind was founded in 1872 by private initia- 
tive. The example was rapidly followed and the beneficial effects of the 
schools became so manifest that in 1887 the minister of public instruc- 
tion adopted measures for the introduction of domestic economy and 
household work into the courses of all elementary schools for girls. 
An official circular was issued presenting a carefully elaborated pro- 
gramme for the guidance of elementary teachers in this part of their 
duties. This measure, it may be observed, is a deviation from the 
   
-P-A-G-E-198
  188 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
general educational policy of Belgium. Although special stress is 
placed upon industrial and technical training, the tendency is to keep 
this distinct from general instruction. 
With the exception of the practical courses in housework and sewing 
for girls, and elementary lessons in agriculture and practical applica- 
tions in rural schools for boys, drawing is the only form of manual 
training included in the programme of elementary schools. The recent 
modifications in the modern course of the intermediate schools are all 
in the interests of general rather than of business or technical training. 
These are treated as specialties belonging to the period subsequent to 
schoollife. Moreover, the introduction of general courses of instruction 
into the industrial and technical schools emphasizes the importance 
which is attached to intellectual development and attainment as an 
equipment for ordinary life. 
Possibly the explanation is to be found in the desire to reduce the 
rate of illiteracy prevailing in Belgium rather than in educational con- 
victions. 
Naturally this department of practical instruction forms a character- 
istic feature of the exposition at Antwerp,! now in progress. The fol- 
lowing particulars of this exhibit, together with the official statistics, 
are from the report of the special agent of this Bureau.? They show 
very clearly the variety and scope of industrial training fostered by 
public agencies. 
TYPICAL EXHIBITS OF SUBSIDIZED INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS AT THE 
ANTWERP EXPOSITION, 
Under the minister of agriculture, of industry, and of public works, 
industrial schools and special trade schools are maintained. A collect- 
ive exhibit of work from these institutions formed much the greater 
part of the whole of the educational exhibition. 
In the industrial schools for boys much attention is given to drawing 
and to simple operations in the working of wood and metals. In the 
industrial schools for girls great attention is given to the household 
arts, such as cooking, cleaning, knitting, sewing, and mending. In the 
trade schools attention is concentrated upon a single trade, although 
two or three allied trades may be taught in the same school. For boys, 
there are schools for clock and watch making, instrument making, 
machine construction, architecture and building, seamanship, fisheries, 
and tailoring. For girls, schools for millinery, flower making and dress- 
making. 
The following details indicate the work carried on in individual 
schools:

exhibit of this course was shown. It is to be taken as a sample of the 
200 similar courses which are maintained in Belgium at an annual 
expense of about $50,000, and which give instruction to about 10,000 
pupils. 
The room was fitted with cooking, laundry, and sewing appliances, 
and all classes of work were carried on by pupils from the school. On 
the walls of the room were cabinets containing samples of food ele- 
ments, medicinal and other herbs, and useful articles, such as soaps 
and powders. The rest of the wall space was covered with charts 
showing methods of preparing food and of performing all household 
duties. 
Instruction is given in the selection, preparation, and cooking of 
foods so that the pupils learn the relative value of the different foods, 
the best methods for using them, and how they should be combined to 
produce good and economical meals. The examples shown were of 
two dinners, each consisting of soup, meat, and two vegetables. One, 
which was for father, mother, and 5 children, cost 1.75 franes, or about 
5 cents for each person. The other, which was for father, mother, and 
8 children, cost 2.05 franes, or about 4 cents for each person. 
In the class in cleaning are taught the best ways to clean wood, 
paint, tin, iron, silver, and clothing. The ironing class practices upon 
plain and fancy clothing and curtains ironed with and without starch. 
The quality of this work seems to be much better than that done by 
the regular laundresses of the country. 
In sewing and mending much attention is given to plain sewing, 
patching, and darning. Some of the darning was exceptionally well 
done. 
It is said that not enough time is devoted to these subjects to affect 
in any way the amount of work done in the ordinary subjects, unless 
by arousing the interest of the pupil it may cause her to carry on her 
other work more easily and successfully. 
School of seamanship.—This institution is one in which much atten- 
tion is given to the design, constraction, and handling of vessels; also 
to the construction of harbors. The exhibit consisted principally of 
models of boats and ship details, of drawings, and of maps showing 
the location of the lights and channels of the North Sea and the ports 
on its borders. 
BLANKENBERGH. 
Fisheries trade school.—Of all the trade schools subsidized by the 
Government this one seemed most novel. Its exhibit consisted of charts 
and relief maps showing the shoals and fishing grounds of the North 
Sea, of models of fishing boats, and of examples of the various imple- 
ments used in the fisheries for catching and curing fish. The course 
of instruction covers seamanship, the natural history of fish, their 
haunts, the methods of catching and preserving fish, and the uses 
which can be made of them.  
-P-A-G-E-200
190 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
BRUSSELS. 
  St. Luke’s School, a church trade school, made an extensive exhibit of 
free-hand and mechanical drawings. The subjects pertained chiefly to 
church building and decoration. 
State trade schools.—The school for the clock and watch making trade 
made an exhibit of models used in the school and of pupils’ work. 
Among the most interesting models were four showing the principal 
escapements used in watch construction. A silver watch made by a 
second-year pupil and valued at $10, also a gold watch by a third-year 
pupil and valued at about $240 were the most attractive examples of 
pupils’ work. 
Trade schools for girls.—The institutions at Brussels for millinery, 
flower making, lace making, and dressmaking had large, well arranged, 
and attractive exhibits. The work from the lace-makers’ school was of 
the greatest interest and consisted of very beautiful handkerchiefs and 
lace trimmings. The work from the flower-makers’ school was installed 
in a case with mirrors below and on two sides. The few bunches of 
lilacs, hyacinths, and jonquils, which were placed in this case, produced 
a pleasing effect. The work from the embroidery and dressmaking 
schools was very good. 
. GHENT. 
St. Luke’s School, like that of Brussels, is a trade school. Its large 
and comprehensive exhibit included furniture and furniture designs, 
free-hand drawing, illuminated work, modeling, lithographing, wood 
and stone carving, and decorative iron forging. As might be expected, 
the church work was better than the lay work. The free-hand draw- 
ing of church decoration showed more strength whether the subject 
were figure or architectural detail than that pertaining to domestic life 
or dwelling houses. 
MONS. 
Lace trade school.—The exhibit from this school was beside the exhibit 
from the lace school of Brussels, and it was difficult to decide which 
was the finest, as every piece of lace shown by either seemed to be 
practically perfect. Mons exhibited more lace for dress trimmings, 
excellent both as regards design and execution. The exhibit of these 
schools was composed largely of drawings, except as described above, 
under Autwerp, Blankenbeigh, Brussels, and Mons. These drawings 
were arranged by years, and one could easily see the effect of the 
instruction and practice, as the quality of the work improved very 
rapidly in the progress from the lower to the upper classes. 
One piece of work from Schaerbeek attracted attention by its pecul- 
iar excellence. It was an exercise in the adaptation of natural forms 
to industrial decoration, and consisted of a series of designs in which 
the sycamore leaf was the only element. These designs were for 
painted and carved friezes, ceramics, plates, tiles, hinges, and roof 
crests. Each one was simple and strong.

In addition to the above statistics, the annual statement of the 
minister of the interior and of public instruction (1891) shows for the 
Superior School of Commerce at Antwerp an attendance of 141 pupils 
in 1890 and an income of 77,943 francs ($15,588), of which 56.7 per cent 
came from the State, and from the municipality 18 per cent; the 
remainder was from balances of the previous year and from private 
sources. 
The provincial School of Mines of Hainaut had an attendance of 
91 pupils and an income of 62,452 franes ($12,490), of which the State, 
furnished 32 per cent, the province 43 per cent, and the commune, 
(Mons) 15 per cent, leaving a small balance from other sources. The 
37 apprenticeship schools enrolled 1,020 pupils (938 boys, 82 girls) and 
had an income of 68,472 franes ($13,694) derived as follows: From the 
State, 54 per cent; provinces, 14.8; communes, 27; other sources, 4.2 
per cent. 
APPENDIX A. 
CITATION FROM “L’INSTRUCTION DU PEUPLE,” BY BMILE DE LAVELEYE. 
[Published 1872.] 
BELGIUM. 
During the Middle Ages primary instruction had fuller development in Flanders 
than elsewhere, because there industry and agriculture had enriched the classes 
who live by work. 
In 1192 the citizens of Gand secured the sanction of their count to a measure 
which stipulated that ‘‘ whoever had the will, capacity, and means for the work, 
should have full right to open a school in the city of Gand without opposition from 
any person.” This, which might be called “liberty of instruction” at that early 
period, was proclaimed also at Ypres at the beginning of the twelfth century. Aft 
that time instruction had already extended into the country, since in many villages 
local dramatic societies were organized to compose and represent the mysteries and 
dramas. 
“There are in this country,” said Guichardin, who lived in Belgium for some- 
time, ‘‘a great number of persons learned and wise in all knowledge and sciences, 
and the greater part of the people know something of grammar; even the villagers 
are able to read and write.” 
During the reunion of Belgium with Holland the Government of King William 
exerted itself to extend instruction into Belgium. The application of the law and 
the methods of Holland, which were excellent, was of great advantage. 
Unfortunately, after the revolution of 1830 the communes, left to themselves, 
nearly everywhere abandoned the work so happily commenced—new proof that 
primary education can not be confided exclusively to local administration without 
compromising and ruining it. The majority of the teachers were reduced to want; 
nearly all sought some other means of subsistence. Only those remained who 
were not qualified for any other profession. To a blind reaction against the system 
of Holland, which resulted in the closing of the best schools, succeeded an indiffer- 
ence not less baneful which prevented the location of new schools. The inter- 
vention of the central power was necessary to arrest the backward movement. 
The communal law of 1836, and following this, the law of 1842, organizing primary 
instruction, started a progressive movement which has never since ceased. The law
-P-A-G-E-203
  
PUBLIC EDUCATION IN BELGIUM. 193 
of 1842 has suffered no modification since its origin; it still actually controls popu- 
lar instruction in Belgium. It is then important to make it known. In its prin- 
cipal provisions this law recalls the French law of 1833. It determines at the outset 
that in each commune at least one primary school shall be established in an acces- 
sible place. However, the commune is not obliged to establish a school at its own 
expense when its educational needs are fully met by private schools. 
A commune is also authorized to adopt one or more private schools, fulfilling the 
legal conditions required in schools which take the place of commnnal schools. 
The provincial deputation decides this, save that appeal may be made to the King. 
All indigent children have the right to gratuitous instruction. 
Primary instruction comprises, as obligatory subjects, religion and morals, read- 
ing, writing, the legal systems of weights and measures, elements of arithmetic, and, 
according to the demands of the localities, the elements of the French language, the 
Flemish, or the German. 
Instruction in religion and morals is given under the direction of the ministers of 
the denomination to which the majority of the pupils of the school belong. Chil- 
dren who do not belong to the communion of the majority are excused from taking 
part in this instruction. : 
The control of the school appertains to the local authorities, save in respect to 
instruction in religion and morals; this is confided to the ministers of religion. A 
double system of inspection is established—lay inspection and ecclesiastical—exer- 
cised the one by cantonal and provincial inspectors, the other by diocesan inspectors; 
the former appointed by the Government, the latter by the bishops. 
The books intended for primary instruction in the schools under inspection must 
be approved by the Government, excepting those relating to religion and morals. 
These are approved by the ecclesiastical authorities only. 
The communal council appoints the teacher. Choice must be made among candi- 
dates who, for two years at least, have attended with good results the courses of 
normal schools under inspection. A candidate who has not a diploma can only be 
appointed with the consent of the central authority. 
The council may suspend a teacher for three months at most. The Government 
decides finally as to his reinstatement or dismissal. The teacher has always the 
right to a hearing. The provincial inspectors are conyoked every three years in a 
central commission under the presidency of the minister of the interior. Each pro- 
vincial inspector snbmits to this central commission, for its consideration, a report 
upon the schools of his district. The commission suggests the necessary modifica- 
tions and improvements. The different religious denominations may be represented 
in the central commission by a delegate having a voice in the deliberations. 
At least once every three months the civil cantonal inspectors must call a confer- 
ence of the teachers of their respective districts. Here questions of pedagogy are 
considered. 2 : 
Fundamentally, all the costs of primary instruction are at the charge of the com- 
mune. Only when the appropriation of the commune is equal to the product of 2 
“centimes added to the principal of the direct taxes may the province intervene; when 
the province has made an equal appropriation, the State in its turn may intervene. 
The teacher must have an annual salary of not less than 200 franes (to-day 850) 
and an allowance for the poor children instructed, besides a house or an indemnity 
in lieu of lodging. 
Such in sum is the organic law of 1842. Very vigorously opposed in Parliament 
at first by the Liberals, it has ever since been attacked by the most zealous members 
of this party. They assert that this law permits the priest to enter the school with- 
out a shadow of authority. 
In Belgium, it is said, the state and the church are completely separated; it is 
then against the spirit of the constitution to accord such powers to the ministers of 
religion who are entirely independent of the lay authorities. This system may be 
ED 93: 13

194 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
possible elsewhere, in France, for example, where the State intervenes in the ap- 
pointment of prelates. In Belgium, where the chureh has no union with the state, 
it can not be tolerated. Moreover, the church naturally desires to see denomina- 
tional schools replace the communal schools. It does not love secular instruction. 
Every day gives proof that when it can destroy this it does not hesitate to do so. If 
the church has not declared war against the communal primary school, this is simply 
becanse it really has the school in its own hand. 
The Belgian constitution formulates so clearly the principle of the equality of 
religious denominations that it was impossible for the law of 1842 to violate the 
same directly. The primary school is therefore in principle a mixed school, where 
children of all religious denominations are freely admitted; but by virtue of article 
6, which confides religious instruction to the teacher, and of article 7, which gives 
the clergy the right to inspect the school at all times with authority, the communal 
school is in reality a Catholic school. It would have been easy to have avoided this 
difficulty. It would have sufficed to confide religious instruction to the clergy, the 
only persons competent in this subject, as was done by the Hollandish law, and by 
the project of law prepared under the ministry of M. de Theux in Belgium in 1833. 
But would the clergy have been content with such provisions? Would they have 
accorded their support to the communal school if they had not the power to super- 
vise and direct it? This is not-probable. Would it have been possible to organize 
secular instruction in Belgium after the precedent afforded by Holland, despite the 
resistance of the clergy, and to bring the children under its influence despite their 
hostility? Mr. J. B. Northomb! did not think so, and he therefore drew up the law 
of 1842 as a compromise measure between the demands of the Catholic party and of 
the Liberal party. The Belgian law of 1842 is inferior to the Netherland law of 
1857 in other respects also. The former went no further than to require one school 
for each commune. 
The Netherland law intended that the number of schools should be proportioned 
to the needs of the population, and to the central authority was given the power to 
force the commune to fulfill its obligations in this respect. The law of 1842 has not 
determined with sufficient precision the proportion which each of the public powers 
charged with the support of public instruction should contribute toward the total 
expense. Different interpretations have been put upon these provisions by the com- 
munes and by the State. Nevertheless, under the law of 1842 much has been done 
for the development of p1imary instruction. (L’Instruction du peuple, pp. 177-180.)

Text-books are to be examined by the council appointed to judge of such matters 
(conseil de perfectionnement), then to be approved by the Government. 
The teacher must not neglect any opportunity of inspiring the pupils with a love 
of country and the national institutions. 
The teacher is to abstain at all times from any remarks against the religious belief 
of the families whose children are confided to his care. 
GENERAL RULES. 
[Decree of August 16, 1879.] 
The instructor is to have constant care for the physical, intellectual, and moral 
education of the pupils under his charge. He is to see that moral duties are under- 
stood, loved, and practiced. He is to watch carefully that pupils observe all rules 
of propriety at all times. 
Primary instruction covers necessarily the branches mentioned in the first para- 
graph of article 5 of the law of July 1, 1879. 
Only those books may be used which have beer approved of as in accordance with 
the law. 
As regards methods of instruction, the teacher must conform to the regulations 
given by the minister of public instruction. 
The distribution of work in the various branches of instruction is to be arranged 
by the head teacher, countersigned (visé) by the cantonal inspector, then ordered 
(or published) by the municipal authorities. This programme is to be placed on the 
wall of the schoolroom. 
The head teacher and assistants are forbidden to make any changes in the 
programme. 
Both principal and assistants are to keep a daily record of the instruction in each 
class, the quality of recitations, ete. 
The assistants and employees about the building are to he under the orders of the 
head teacher or whoever takes his place. 
The school yard is to be opened at least a quarter of an hour before the recitations 
commence, 
The head teacher and the assistants are to watch over the pupils when they enter 
and leave the schoolroom and during recess. * * * 
Head teachers and assistants must not attend to anything else during the recita- 
tions than the instruction of their pupils. 
The classification of pupils in the different divisions belongs to the head teacher, 
or in certain cases it may be referred to the cantonal inspector. * 
The head teacher is to keep watch over the pupils, so that they do not waste their 
time. 
The head teacher and assistants are forbidden to show any preference for any 
bright pupil to the neglect of others, either by reason of desiring to make a fine 
effect at the examinations or for any reason whatsoever. The instruction should be 
distributed equally among the pupils. 
The head téacher is to see that proper care is taken of the building and its appur- 
tenances. He is to have a care that nothing is allowed which might injuriously 
affect the health of the pupils. He is to see that the schoolroom is always neat and 
that it is cleaned at least once a day. The room should be ventilated before pupils 
enter and after they leave. 
In localities where the physicians of the poor receive a salary from the board of 
health (bureau de bienfaisance) they are expected to visit the public schools at least 
once a month. 
At the close of the visit they are to report the sanitary condition of the pupils to 
the proper authorities (collége échevinal). 
Any pupils attacked by a contagious disease are to be sent home, and they can 
not enter the schoolroom again until a certificate, stating that they are entirely 
cured, has been obtained from the physician.

  196 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
PROGRAMME OF EDUCATION. 
  The following from the circular, explanatory of the programme, shows the ideal of 
popular education contemplated by the Liberal party. 
“Tf itis important that the programme should neither alarm nor discourage anyone, 
it is of supreme necessity that it should offer serious obstacles to routine and become 
an instrument of progress; that it should compel the teacher to awaken in his pupils 
a spirit of observation, experiment, and reflection; that instead of habituating him 
to the disastrous methods of verbalism it should urge him to labor for the sound 
development of the faculties. It should constantly be a reminder to him that his last 
as well as his first daily duty is to make a thorough preparation of his lessons—that 
is to say, to find out the surest, shortest, and most attractive way of making his 
instruction reach the minds and hearts of his pupils. 
“The programme ought to fulfill another important condition. It should stimulate 
the teachers in small communes, while it responds to more general requirements. It 
should arouse them and encourage them to lead their pupils as far as the extreme 
limits of primary education properly so called willpermit. But itshould not become 
an obstacle in the path of improvement in larger communes which may wish to extend 
the education of their children beyond the ordinary sphere. In order to comply with 
these different principles the plan of study has been divided into two great sections— 
the programme of the primary school proper and of the superior primary school. 
“The programme of the primary school proper is obligatory throughout and em- 
braces three successive courses or grades of two years ormoreeach. In schools where 
the attendance is regular the first or elementary grade will include, asa rule, children 
of from 6 to 8 years of age; the second, children of 8 to 10; and the third, those from 
10 to 12 years of age. Itis not the intention of the Government to prescribe in an abso- 
lute way the precise time to be devoted to studying the subjects assigned to each 
grade, It contents itself with requiring that these three great stages of school life 
should be clearly marked in each school, and it is also convinced that the majority 
of children will be able to pass them without too much effort between the ages of 6 
and 12, and very easily between 6 and 13 or 6 and 14 years of age.” 
It belongs to the inspectors, the communal governments, and the teachers to adapt 
the programme to the needs of each locality by distributing the subjects of study 
among the different school years and divisions, and by selecting the points which 
will only be treated summarily and those which, according to the longer or shorter 
time at the disposal of the teachers, can be studied more deeply. 
Besides the obligatory subjects enumerated in article 5 of the law of July 1, 1879, 
the programme of primary schools includes two elective studies: a language (French 
for Flemish or German localities, or German for Walloon districts) and elementary 
notions of agriculture, horticulture, and arboriculture. Instructions in these two 
branches will be organized in accordance with the regulations of the royal decree of 
April 25, 1880. 
The superior primary school can only be established by virtue of the same decree. 
It will be opened for children of at least twelve years of age who have finished 
the studies of the third grade of the primary school. Instruction in each of these 
schools must be given by one, and, if necessary, two, special teachers. The superior 
primary schools offer great advantages to the large rural or industrial communes 
which have no secondary State schools. They will continue the general education of 
the young, furnish preparatory training for an agricultural or professional career, 
and diffuse among the population, by an extension of knowledge, a taste for obser- 
vation and for intellectual pleasures. 
Communes which can not organize a complete superior primary school may add to 
the obligatory programme of the ordinary primary school one or more of the subjects 
of study of the superior primary school, in accordance with the regulations of the 
above-mentioned royal decree, such studies to be pursued only by pupils of at least
-P-A-G-E-207
  PUBLIC EDUCATION IN BELGIUM. 197 
12 years of age. In the interest of the scholars care must be taken that the number 
of studies thus added shall be as restricted as possible. 
As formulated, the programme of primary education, with the extensions it may 
receive, embraces four concentric circles gradually widening, each of which embraces 
all the subjects of study. These four progressive courses, the first three of which 
are obligatory, are characterized by being at once independent and connected, each 
forming a whole in itself and yet being complemented by the others. The system 
adopted, so eminently suited to the simultaneous development of all the faculties of 
a child, also has the advantage of corresponding in its first three courses to the 
present classification of scholars into the lower, middle, and superior divisions, and 
is adapted at the same time to the needs of children who leave school without having 
finished a full course of primary studies. 
By offering all the subjects of study in each grade, according to the measure of 
the intellectual powers of the children, the latter are enabled to reap from their 
attendance at school much more solid advantages than could be gained from instruc- 
tion in fragmentary courses graded in successive stages. 
Instruction in morals.—The official programme determines the office of the teacher 
with regard to moral instruction, as follows: 
Moral instruction is the noblest and most important work of the school, and the 
teacher must devote all his energies to it. He is to employ all the resources of his 
mind and heart in making easy to his pupils the practice of their duties to them- 
selves, their parents, their superiors, their equals, and their country. 
Instruction in duty to God belongs more especially to the different religious 
beliefs, but by making use of an idea common to all of them without entering on 
dogmatic ground the teacher can find occasion to talk to his pupils about the Deity, 
the soul, and those great moral and Christian truths which, to the honor of human- 
ity, have progressively become the domain of all religions and the inheritance of all 
civilized nations. (Ministerial circular of July 17, 1879.) 
It is principally by his administration of the school that the teacher will inculcate 
morality. The dignity of his acts and language, his respect for justice, his sincere 
regard for his pupils, will enable him to establish a wise discipline and assure him 
the respect and love of his scholars. Thus holding the position of a good father of a 
family he will endeavor to give instruction which, like that of the domestic hearth, . 
breathes simplicity, goodness, and virtue. 
He will take advantage of all the school exercises, recreations, sports, and prome- 
nades, and the thonsand incidents of school life to enlighten the consciences of his 
pupils, strengthen their good and check their evil propensities, and exercise and 
cultivate their wills in good directions. He will en:leavor to inspire respect for truth 
and justice, to develop a spirit of charity and tolerance, and a love of work and 
economy. 
He will seek opportunities for rendering his pupils sensible to the beautiful in 
nature, in art, and in a moral life, thus enabling them to profit by the influence 
which esthetic culture exercises on the education of the feelings. 
Tho character of the primary school is opposed to providing for it a course of moral 
didactics made in accordance with a plan devised beforehand. What a child needs 
is the good example of his teacher and of his comrades, moral instruction in action, 
a spontaneous lesson which comes now from something he reads and now from some 
aspect of nature, at one time from a passage of history and at another from a 
fable. 
There is no objection to giving certain lessons at fixed hours every week on some 
story, fable, or historical or literary extract. The teacher may make the selections 
from the reader or classical manual, and arrange them so as to present in a concrete 
and entertaining form the principal moral duties of a child. Short pieces of poetry, 
selected with discretion, offer valuable resources. They induce a love of nature, 
strengthen the patriotic sentiment, and refine the moral sense.    
 
-P-A-G-E-208
    198 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Schedule of work.—The number of hours of lessons and other exercises a week is 
as follows: In the first or elementary grade, twenty-five hours; in the second grade, 
twenty-eight hours; in the third grade, twenty-eight hours; and in the superior 
primary schools, thirty hours. 
Examinations.—Competitive examinations take place annually for pupils of the 
superior division of primary schools. 
TEACHING GEOMETRICAL FORMS IN THE PRIMARY SCHOOL. 
The Belgian primary school attributes much importance to the study of geomet- 
ricalforms. This branch furnishes excellent means for intellectual development. It 
lays the foundation of instruction in drawing and forms an admirable preparation 
for different trades (carpentry, masonry, locksmithing, ete.). 
The inspectors must be careful to see that the instruction is essentially practical and 
given by inspection (i.e., from objects) only, that scientific demonstrations are pro- 
hibited, and that the teacher is sparing in definitions. It is enough for the pupils to 
recognize the forms by perceiving their relations, and to be able to reproduce them 
in a drawing and by one of the methods borrowed from the Frébel system (by bend- 
ing, constructing figures of pieces of wood, etc.). 
Our method, therefore, is not that of scientific geometry, with its theorems, corol- 
laries, and problems. It is entirely based on inspection and practice, and is only the 
natural development of what takes place in kindergarten. 
The essential point is that pupils know how to draw or construct the geometrical 
forms and learn their leading properties, with the measure of their areas and volumes. 
SCHOOL HYGIENE. 
The inspection of school hygiene under the central administration of the depart- 
ment of public instruction includes the three degrees of education. As far as primary 
education is concerned the inspectors are charged with the examination of building 
sites, plans of construction and of improvements and extensions of school buildings. 
Their main duty is to see that the approved proposals are in accordance with the just 
demands of hygiene and pedagogy. They must also be very particular to insist that 
the designs for schools conform to the requirements of simplicity and good taste. 
- Since its organization the bureau of inspection has brought about great reduction in 
expenses by opposing extravagance in fagades and in general furnishing. 
It has drawn up a programme for the construction of normal schools which has been 
adopted by thedepartment. This programme has facilitated the work of the architects 
and has enabled them toveffect very considerable savings in making new estimates 
and plans. 
The examination of school designs is not, however, the only mission of the inspectors 
of school hygiene. 
When there are different opinions as to the best sites to choose for schools, or when 
improvements or extensions of existing buildings are under discussion, they visit the 
spots designated, make examinations, and report to the department for its guidance, 
It is also the duty of the inspection bureau, so far as the school is concerned, to 
bring about the harmonious action of the physical, intellectual, and moral nature of 
the children. It is important that the impulse to study in all school grades should 
be regulated in accordance with the laws of human nature, by applying the princi, 
ples of hygiene, which require an equilibrium of the physical forces and the intel- 
lectual faculties. 
A programme based on these principles is vast. It can only be prepared by method- 
ically correlating observations made in all parts of the country. To accomplish this 
researches of two kinds are necessary. The hygienic situation of all school build- 
ings must be ascertained, so as to apply to them the improvements which may be 
found necessary, and, what is of no less importance, the inspectors must prepare a 
system of regular medical inspection of all educational institutions in the whole 
realm, At present this can only be done in the larger cities.

Every commune must have at least one communal school, situated in an accessible

The commune may adopt one or more private schools. In this case the King, upon 
the advice of the “ permanent committee,” may exempt the commune from the obli- 
gation to maintain a communalschool. This dispensation can not be accorded if 20 
heads of families having children of school age demand the creation or the main- 
tenance of a school for the instruction of their children and the ‘‘permanent com- 
mittee” concurs in this demand. 
In case of necessity two or more communes, upon authority from the King, may 
unite to found and maintain a school. (Art. 1.) 
Communal primary schools are directed by the communes. 
The number of the schools and of the teachers is determined by the communal 
council according to the needs of the locality. The council also controls everything 
relating to the establishment and organization of infant schools (écoles gardiennes) 
and of schools for adults. (Art. 2.) 
The children of poor parents reccive gratuitous instruction. The communes must 
see that all those who do not attend uninspected private schools are provided with 
instruction either in a communal or adopted school. 
The communal council, on communication with the board of charities, draws up 
every year a list of poor children receiving gratuitous instruction in the communal 
or adopted schools and determines the amount of pay due the teachers of those 
schools for each scholar receiving such instruction. This list and the assessment 
of the amount due is submitted for approval to the committee, subject to appeal to 
the King. The committee also determine, under appeal to the King, the proportion 
to be paid by the board of charities for the education of poor children, and the pro- 
portion so assigned is included in the appropriation for the board. (Art. 3.) 
Primary instruction comprises as obligatory branches, reading, writing, elements 
of arithmetic, the legal system of weights and measures, the elements of the French 
language, of the Flemish or the German, according to local requirements; geography, 
history of Belgium, elements of drawing, singing, and gymnastics. Moreover, it 
comprises needlework for girls, and for boys in the rural districts notions of agri- 
culture. 
Communes have the right to extend the programme as may be possible or desirable, 
The communes may inscribe religious and moral instruction at the head of the 
curriculum of all or some of their elementary schools. ‘This instruction is given at 
the commencement or at the end of the school hours. Children at the request of their 
parents, are excused from attending such instruction. 
(a) In the case of a commune in which 20 heads of families having children of 
school age ask that their children shall be exempted from assisting at religions 
instruction, the King can, at the request of the parents, oblige such commune to 
organize, for the use of these children, one or more special classes. 
(b) If, in spite of the request of 20 heads of faniilies having children of school age, 
the commune refuse to inscribe the teaching of their religion in the school curricu- 
lum or hinder such instruction being given by the ministers of their religion or by 
persons approved of by these latter, the Government can, at the request of the par- 
ents, adopt one «r more private schools, as may be requisite, provided they meet the 
conditions prescribed for adoption by the commune. (Art. 4.) 
Teachers must show an equal solicitude for the education and instruction of the 
children under their charge. They are to neglect no opportunity to inspire in their 
pupils the sentiments of duty, love of country, respect for national institutions, and
-P-A-G-E-210

attachment to constitutional liberty. They must abstain from any attack upon 
the religious beliefs of the families whose children are intrusted to them. (Art. 5.) 
The communes bear the expenses of primary instruction in the communal schools, 
the provinces and the communes to an extent not less than 2 centimes on the amount 
of the direct tax. 
A commune can not obtain subsidies from the State or province for primary in- 
struction unless it contributes at least 4 centimes additional to the direct tax and 
carries out the present law in all points. Each year to the proposed estimate there 
must be annexed a detailed account of the application of the funds of the preceding 
year, including those of the State, province, and commnne. (Art. 6.) 
The communal council has the right of appointing, of suspending, of placing en 
disponibilité (out of active service, but drawing pay), and of reyoking the appoint- 
ments of teachers. At the same time, the teacher’s appointment can not be canceled 
without the approval of the permanent deputation. 
The council and the teacher may appeal to the King. The same rules apply to 
all suspension for more than a month and to all suspension with stoppage of pay or 
upon reduced pay. Suspension once decreed by the communal council can not be 
renewed by it on the same facts nor exceed six months’ duration. The King, in 
accord with the advice of the permanent deputation, both the teacher and the com- 
munal council being heard, may suspend or revoke a teacher’s appointment. Sub- 
ject to the same advice, he may place a teacher en disponibilité, 
The salary of an unattached teacher is paid by the commune if the order depriving 
him of service is issued by the communal council; by the State if the order is issued 
by the King. No place may remain more than a month without ateacher. The Col- 
lege Echevinal designates the substitute. The council fixes the minimum of teachers’ 
salaries. The salary can not be less than 1,000 frances ($200) for assistant teachers 
and 1,200 franes ($240) for teachers. The teacher has, besides this, the right to be 
lodged or to receive an allowance for house rent. 
The communal council can place a teacher on the unattached list, and so keep him 
from active employment, in which case he will receive waiting pay, under conditions 
which will be determined by royal decree. The amount can not be less than half 
his salary nor less than 750 francs. This pay will be furnished by the State, the 
province, and the commune, in the proportions fixed by article 5 of the law of May 
16,1876. * * * (Art.7.) 
The communal schoolmasters are chosen from among those Belgians, either by 
birth or naturalization, who have gained the diploma of an elementary teacher after 
being trained in a public normal school, or who have passed an examination after 
having attended lectures during at least two years, or who have gained a diploma 
for secondary teaching (enscignement moyen) of the second degree. They can also 
be selected from among those persons who have successfully passed the teachers’ 
examination before a jury appointed by the Government. (Art. 8.) 
A private school can not be adopted unless it fulfills the following conditions: 
(1) Theschool must be established in a suitable building. 
(2) At least half the number of teachers must have received a diploma or have 
passed the examination for the male or female teachers; but the minister is at liberty 
to dispense with this condition during the two years following the promulgation of 
this law. Those who have had charge of communal schools prior to the present law 
are exempt from examination. 
(3) Should religious instruction form part of the curriculum, such instruction 
shall be given at the beginning or at the end of the school hours. Children, on the 
application of their parents, shall be exempted from attending religious instruction. 
(4) The curriculum shall comprise the subjects mentioned in section 1 of article 4 
of the law. 
(5) The adopted school must accept State inspection. 
(6) It must admit poor children without requiring other payment than that pre- 
scribed in article 3 of the law.
-P-A-G-E-211
  
PUBLIC EDUCATION IN BELGIUM. 201 
(7) The number of hours of school attendance shall not be less than twenty per 
week, without including the time devoted to teaching of religion and morals; after 
deducting the time employed on needlework, this number shall not be less than 
sixteen. <* "i *- (Art..9.) 
Communal and adopted schools are subject to inspection by the State; this can not 
extend to the course in religion and morals, 
Ineach province there must be one or more principal inspectors, and in each district 
under aprincipal inspector several cantonal inspectors. Once a year the cantonal 
inspector must visit all the schools of his district. Once, at least, every three 
months he inust call the teachers of his ‘district together for a conference, and must 
submit to the principal inspector a report upon the state of primary instruction in 
the communes under his charge. Once a year each principal inspector must preside 
over one of the teachers’ conferences, and once in two years, at least, must visit 
each school of his province. He must submit an annual report to the minister upon 
  the state of primary instruction in his province. * * * (Art, 10.) 
The State, the provinces, and the communes may establish normal schools. 
(Art. 11.) 
The organization of normal schools belonging to the State is regulated by the 
Government, A ministerial decree insures absolute liberty of conscience to stu- 
dents of the normal school. (Art. 12.) 
The provincial and communal normal school, as well as private schools, may 
receive State aid, provided they are subject to inspection. * * * (Art. 13.) 
The communal inspectors and téachers and the directors, professors, and teachers 
of State normal schools must take the oath prescribed by article 2 of the decree of 
July 20, 1831. (Art. 14.) 
A report on the condition of primary instruction shall be presented to the legisla- 
ture by the Government every three years. (Art. 15.) 
Article 16 specifies the laws repealed or modified by. the present law. 
Persons who obtained the diploma of primary teacher from a private normal school 
between the adoption and the repeal of the law of July 1, 1879, may receive the 
appointment of communal teacher on condition of obtaining a confirmation of such 
diploma from a board organized in accordance with article 8. 
It shall be the duty of the board to see that the private normal school giving the 
diploma is organized so as to train teachers capable of keeping communal primary 
schools established in conformity with the present law. The board may make the 
confirmation subject to a complementary examination on certain matters to be des- 
ignated by it. In such case the teacher who has a diploma shall have one year to 
prepare for the examination. He may meanwhile exercise the functions of a com- 
munal teacher provisionally. (Art. 17.)

  CHAPTER IV. 
ELEMENTARY EDUCATION. 
GREAT BRITAIN, 
England and Wales.—Population 29,731,100, estimated 1893. 
School attendance.—From the report of the committee of council on 
education (education department) for 1893 it. appears that the State- 
aided elementary schools had an enrollment for the year ending August 
31, 1893, of 5,126,373 children, or 17 per cent of the population (1893). 
The daily average attendance was 4,100,030 (i. e., 2,137,487 boys and 
1,962,543 girls), or 82 per cent of the enrollment. The average attend- 
ance at evening schools was 81,068. 
As compared with the preceding year there was a gain of 2.38 per 
cent in day-school enrollment and 5.92 per cent in average attendance. 
It is noted that the gain in both items is nearly as great among the 
older children—i. e., those above 7 years of age—as in those below 7. 
To quote the report: 
The number of infants on the registers has gone up from 1,764,930 to 1,813,992, 
an increase of 49,062 (2.83 per cent), and that of older children from 3,242,049 to 
3,312,381, an increase of 70,332 (2.17 per cent). The number of infants in average 
attendance bas similarly risen from 1,183,830 to 1,278,798, an increase of 94,968 (8.02 
per cent), and that of older children in average attendance from 2,686,944 to 2,821,232, 
an increase of 134,288 (5 per cent). 
This result is attributed chiefly to the practical effect of the law of 
1891 in bringing about the abolition or substantial reduction of school 
fees. On the registers of the schools actually inspected during the 
year under review there were 4,236,867 free pupils, as against 589,506 
paying fees. Other causes for the improved attendance are the grow- 
ing sense of the importance of education aniong parents and school 
managers, and also, paradoxical as it may seem, the stagnation of trade 
during the year. Experience in England, as. in the United States, 
shows that dull trade makes a full school and brisk trade an empty one. 
In the absence of temptation to send their children into employment 
on the earliest possible opportunity parents are content to allow them 
to stay on at school, and especially so now that no payment is neces- 
sarily demanded from them. In illustration of this fact the report 
203
-P-A-G-E-214
  204 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
states that an investigation into the effect of the dispute in the coal 
trade of last autumn upon the school attendance in the districts 
affected showed a distinct increase in the attendance of children, dur- 
ing the weeks for which the dispute lasted, over'the normal attendance 
for the year. 
Classification of schools and relative attendance.—The schools included 
in the report are board schools and private (voluntary) schools, chiefly 
denominational. The former are established and conducted by elected 
boards and maintained by local taxes (rates) and the Government 
grant, with fees in certain cases. They numbered 4,904 and comprised 
41 per cent of the pupils in average attendance upon elementary 
schools. The voluntary schools, which are established and controlled 
by private individuals, churches, or associations, and maintained by 
the Government grant, private subscriptions, endowments, and fees in 
some cases, numbered 14,673 and comprised 59 per cent of the average 
attendance. 
Teaching force—The elementary schools employed 101,751 teachers, 
of whom 49,340 had Government certilicates, 25,123 were uncertificated 
assistants, and 27,288 were pupil teachers. The proportion of women 
teachers was 59 per cent in the first class specified, and 80 per cent in 
each of the other two classes. 
The average salaries of certificated teachers were, for men £121 15s. 
2d. ($592.44), and for women £79 4s, ($385.39), About 31 per cent of 
the certificated masters and 17 per cent of the certificated mistresses 
are also provided with free residences. The training colleges supply 
the greater proportion of certificated teachers to the service. The 44 
boarding colleges were attended in 1893 by 3,409 students and the 14 
day training colleges by 564 students. These colleges, like the elemen- 
tary schools, are supported in part by Government appropriations. 
Inspection.—In accordance with the law of 1870 and subsequent modi- 
fying laws under which the system of elementary education is admin- 
istered, local boards and managers have full control of elementary 
schools. In order, however, to secure a share in the Government grant 
they must fulfill certain conditions as to equipments and staff, duration 
of school year, curricula, ete. 
The Government grant is allowed solely for instruction in secular 
subjects under the conditions specified in the law and departmental 
regulations. Religious exercises in board schools must be strictly un- 
denominational; in private schools sectarian instruction must not be 
forced upon any pupil. 
The Government maintains an inspection over the schools to deter- 
mine the manner in which its requirements are met. For the purposes 
of this inspection the country is divided into 10 districts, each under a 
chief inspector, whose duties are of a general nature, advisory and 
1For detailed particulars see the Commissioner’s Report for 1888-89. vol. 1, pp. 97-101.

judicial, with the specific obligation to present an annual report to the 
department based upon the reports of the inspectors. The latter num- 
ber at present 91, which, with 53 subinspectors and 160 inspectors’ assist- 
ants, gives a total of 316 officials engaged in the work. 
In the inspectors’ reports the schools are classified as infant schools 
and classes; i. e., for children under 7 years of age and schools for older 
pupils, i.e., 7 to 14, In the former the Government grant is allowed 
entirely on the basis of average attendance, and consists of a fixed por- 
tion at the rate of 7s. or 9s. per capita and a variable grant of 2s., 4s., 
or 6s. per capita. The highest fixed rate is allowed only when the 
school is held in a room specially furnished for the instruction of infants. 
The rate of the variable grant allowed is determined by the report as 
to general conditions; it may be withheld altogether. For the year 
under review only 38 schools out of 7,140 and 1,175 classes out of 5,755 
were recommended for the lower fixed rate. The showing as to the 
variable grant indicates that in general the larger the infant school the 
greater its merit. Extra grants are allowed in the infant schools for 
needlework, drawing, and singing. The total rate per capita allowed 
was 15s, 7d. and the total payment £994,009. ($4,836,848). 
The grants to older schools are made up as follows:

Grant for needlework on account of girls -- ee

Grant for specific subjects 2 Oor 3.0 
  All the foregoing are reckoned on the average attendance, excepting 
the grant for needlework, which is reckoned on the average attendance 
of girls only, and the grant for specific subjects, which is paid for each 
individual passing examination in the same. The total graut allowed 
in schools for. older scholars was at the rate of 19s. 24d. per capita of 
average attendance, and yielded the sum of £2,734,618 ($13,306,651), 
Besides the Bynea ory subjects of instruction, i. e., reading, writing, 
arithmetic, needlework for girls, and drawing fee boys, additional class 
subjects were maintained in 95 per cent of the schools. Not more 
than two class subjects are allowed at a time. The reports show that 
English is the preferred subject and geography second. Hereafter the 
department will not recognize any school that does not maintain at 
least one class subject. 
Among interesting particulars brought out by the inspectors is the 
marked increase in the number of schools maintaining savings banks. 
The returns show that savings were received in 8,548 schools, an 
increase of 2,165 over the previous year. This progress is attributed 
to a disposition on the part of parents to invest week by week the 
small sums formerly paid in school fees.
-P-A-G-E-216
  206 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
The Government inspection extends also to teachers’ training col- 
leges, which are under two chief inspectors, one assigned to the 
schools for young men, the other to those for young women.! 
The Government grant for the residential (boarding) colleges in 1893 
amounted to £126,392, which was equal to about 70 per cent of the 
current expenditure for the same. The grants to day training colleges, 
established in connection with university colleges, under regulations 
adopted in 1890, amounted to $18,322, or about 70 per cent of their 
current expenditure. 
Finances.—The current expenditure for elementary education was 
£8,640,859 ($42,046,420). Of this amount the Government grantallowed 
upon the reports of inspection, and in lieu of school fees, furnished 67 
per cent; local taxes (rates allowed for board schools only), 20 per cent; 
fees, 4 per cent; other local sources, i. e., subscriptions, endowments, 
ete., the balance. : 
The expenditure per capita of average attendance was, in board 
schools, £2 8s. 14d. ($11.71) and in private schools (voluntary) £1 17s. 
64d. ($9.13). 
Two important laws relative to education were passed during the 
year. These are the “elementary education (blind and deaf children) 
act 1893” and the “elementary education (school attendance) act 1893.” 
The former provides for the education of blind and deaf children in 
elementary schools under special arrangement, and makes it obligatory 
upon parents to avail themselves of the provision, unless their children 
are otherwise instructed. The latter is characterized in the report as 
a distinct “step forward in the history of national education.” “It 
provides, in effect, that the minimum age for exemption, whether total 
or partial, from the obligation to attend school fixed by local by-laws 
made under the education act shall be raised to 11 years of age, in- 
stead of 10, as heretofore; and it contains a corresponding prohibition 
of employment of children under 11.” The department expresses the 
hope “that as years go on, and public opinion ripens as to the impor- 
tance of sufficient education, and the mischief of early child labor, it 
may be found possible to raise still further the minimum age of exemp- 
tion.” 
The new regulations respecting evening schools also render this a 
memorable year in the history of elementary education in England. 
The purpose of these regulations is indicated in the word “continua- 
tion,” applied to the evening schools for the first time. Heretofore 
these schools have been treated merely as elementary schools for igno- 
rant youths. Under the new conception it is believed that they will 
become the means of extending the education of ambitious working 
men and women who desire to pursue their studies beyond the elemen- 
tary stage. 
IMr. J. G. Fitch, who has held this position since 1885, resigned at the close of 
the year under review (1893).
-P-A-G-E-217
ELEMENTARY EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN. 207 
Hereafter pupils above 21 years of age are to be counted in the 
average attendance for grants, and no pupil is to be compelled to take 
the purely elementary subjects (i. e., reading, writing, and arithmetic). 
Among the subjects of instruction recognized for the fixed grant are 
drawing, manual and technical instruction, physical exercises, military 
drill (for boys and men), household work (for girlsand women). Grants 
may also be allowed for modern languages, algebra and geometry, 
chemistry, physics and other branches of science, vocal music, book- 
keeping, ete. Considerable freedom is allowed to managers in respect 
to the organization and conduct of the schools. It is noticeable that 
the teachers need not necessarily be lay persons. 
As the scheme did not go into operation until May 18, 1893, its effects 
ean not yet be certainly determined. It is, however, apparent that 
attendance upon and interest in these schools have been greatly stimu- 
lated by the new measure. 
Scotland.—Population, 4,090,315 (cstimated, 1893). 
The system of public instruction established under the “ Scotch ed. 
ucation act,” 1872, resembles the English system in its main features; 
both are maintained by the combined action of Government and local 
agencies, with like provision as to Government appropriations and 
inspection. : 
The Scotch educational department has the same functions as the 
English; it is composed, like the latter, of lords of the privy council, 
and has the same president. The officers of inspection in Scotland 
comprise 3 chief inspectors, 22 inspectors, 4 subinspectors, and 21 
inspectors’ assistants. 
‘rhe main points of difference between the Scotch and the English 
systems are the greater prevalence in the former of board schools (i. e., 
publie schools sharing in local taxes), which enroll about 85 per cent of 
pupils in Scotland, as against 41 percent in England; the greater freedom 
left to local boards with respect to religious instruction, and the distinct 
recognition given to secondary education by the Scottish school law. 
Statistics 1892-93.—The report of the education department for the 
year ending September 30, 1893, shows that the enrollment of children 
in the schools under inspection was 664,838, or 16.25 per cent of the 
population, and the average attendance 542,851, or 81.6 per cent of 
the enrollment. There were also 19,575 pupils in average attendance 
upon the night schools. 
The number of boys in attendance upon the day schools is slightly 
in excess of the number of girls, being 52 per cent as against 48 per 
cent of girls. As regards age, 20 per cent of pupils in average attend-- 
ance were below 7 years of age, 39 per cent between 7 and 10 years, 
and 41 per cent above 10, 
As regards subjects of instruction, it appears that out of 3,010 depart- 
ments (i. e., divisions of a school under a separate head teacher) for
-P-A-G-E-218
    208 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
older pupils (above 7 years of age), class subjects had been taken in 
2,996, or more than 99 per cent of the whole. English and geography 
are, as in England, the preferred subjects. Further, 44,280 pupils were 
presented for examination in from one to three specific subjects. These 
are within the range of secondary or high school branches. 
The teaching force of the schools comprised 8,325 teachers having a 
Government certificate, 1,874 assistants, and 3,775 pupil teachers; total, 
13,974. Nearly one-third of the teachers were men. Average salaries 
for certificated teachers were £135 15s. 2d. ($660.50) for men and £64 
8s. 10d. ($313.56) for women. About one-fourth of the head teachers 
are also provided with free residence. : 
The training colleges for teachers, 7 in number, were attended by 945 
students; of these 138 were also pursuing studies in university classes. 
As the course of training is two years, these colleges afford about 440 
trained teachers annually to the schools. 
Expenditure—The expenditure for elementary education, day and 
night schools, was £1,280,289 ($6,229,886). Of this sum the Govern- 
ment grant, including grant in lieu of fees, supplied 71 per cent, local 
taxes (rates) 22.6 per cent, tuition fees 2.6 per cent, other local sources 
the small balance of 3.8 per cent. The cost per capita of average 
attendance was in board schools £2 6s. 114d. ($11.42), in private (vol- 
untary) schools £2 2s. 65d. ($10.34). 
Examination for merit certificates.—In 1891 the department offered a 
merit certificate for pupils of elementary schools above the fifth grade 
who should pass a special examination, intended as a proof of special 
thoroughness in the elementary branches. It was hoped that this 
measure might induce pupils to remain longer at school than was for- 
merly the rule. Such, indeed, seems to have been its effect. The num- 
ber of pupils seeking the certificate has increased each year, reaching 
in 1893 a total of 3,791. 
Secondary schools.—The inspection of higher schools was first under- 
taken by the department in 1885. The present year 69 schools accepted 
the service, of which number 27 were public high schools, 124 endowed 
*shools, and 18 private schools. The “leaving certificate” examination, 
which is accepted by the universities and many professional authorities 
in place of their own preliminary examinations, attracts a constantly 
increasing number of candidates. In 1888 the number was 972; it rose 
to 7,148 the present year. 
RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION UNDER THE LONDON SCHOOL BOARD 
The most notable event of the year’s history is the agitation of the 
question of religious instruction in the London schools. To understand 
the full significance of this agitation it is necessary to have in mind the 
previous history of the matter at issue. In the celebrated debate over 
the education law of 1870 the question of religious instruction in public 
schools was discussed with thoroughness, with ardor and candor, and
-P-A-G-E-219
. ELEMENTARY EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN. 209 
  a course was adopted that has ever since been known as the “set- 
tlement of 1870,” an expression indicating the general hope that the 
arrangements were final. Occasional efforts. however, haye been made 
to reopen the matter. This was especially the case at the time of the 
appointment of the royal commission on the elementary education acts 
(1886), but although this body had a decided leaning toward the claims 
and interests of the established chureh, it made no recommendations 
to disturb the “settlement.” 
It was manifest from the investigation of the commission that the 
people of England by an overwhelming majority desired religious 
instruction in the elementary schools, and equally nanifest that the 
existing adjustments gave general satisfaction to the laity. The 
provisions of the law of 1870 with respect to this matter were com- 
prised in section 7, commonly known as the ‘conscience clause,” which 
prohibited every school that shared in the Government grant from 
applying any religious test to pupils or forcing sectarian instruction 
upon any. The religious exercises were to be conducted either at the 
beginning or end of the day’s session, so that children whose parents 
so desired might withdraw without the loss of other exercises; more-’ 
over, the fourteenth section of the act prohibited board schools from 
“the teaching of any religious catechism or religious formulary which. 
is distinctive of any particular denomination.” 
Under these restrictions, as was ascertained by the commission, the 
school boards of England, save only 91 out of a total of 2,255, had pro- 
vided for religious exercises in their schools. 
The London board early elaborated a very full syllabus of Bible 
instruction which is followed in all its schools, and occupies from half 
to three-quarters of an hour daily. Explicit directions are issued to 
the teachers as to the carrying out of the scheme. They are requested 
to make the lessons as practical as possible and not to give attention 
to unnecessary details. 
In addition to the large number of children in London affected by 
this instruction (about 450,000), the influence of the scheme has been 
greatly extended through its adoption by 101 other boards, including 
several of the most important cities. With these conditions in mind, 
it will be easy to understand the excitement caused by the sudden 
reopening of the question in the London board. 
It is proposed here only to give the leading facts of the controversy. 
The discussion was started in the board in February, 1893, by Mr. 
Athelstan Riley, who called attention to the following statement made 
by the chairman of the committee on religious instruction (Rev. J. J. 
Coxhead) in the columns of a church paper: 
Ihave been this morning present in one of these (board) schools during the viva 
voce examination of the children by the teachers. In the first room to which I 
entered I heard these questions: What was the name of the mother of Jesus? What 
was the name of His father? Kvery child that the teacher called upon answered

  Joseph. Not a word was said to imply the existence of His divine nature. The 
teacher was the headmistress of an infant department (i. e., for children under 7 
years of age). 
In view of this statement, Mr. Riley moved— 
That the teachers of the board be informed that when the religious instruction 
for the day is given on passages from the Bible which refer to Christ, the children 
are to be distinctly taught that Christ is God, and such explanations of the doctrine 
of the Holy Trinity are to be given as may be suited to their capacities. (School 
Board Chronicle, February 4, 1893, p. 122.) 
Although Mr. Riley started the discussion, the chairman of the board, 
Mr. Joseph R. Diggle, soon became the leader of the movement, while 
the Hon. Lyulph Stanley appeared as the leader of the opposition.! 
During the discussion of the original motion, which was prolonged 
through several meetings of the board, Lyulph Stanley moved “that 
the board adhere to the scheme of biblical and religious teaching 
which was settled by the first board and has remained in force down to 
the present time.” This was carried by a majority of 12 in a vote of 
54. At the same meeting a motion was carried by a majority of 19 
providing for the substitution of the words “Christian religion and 
morality,” for “morality and religion,” the expression used in the orig- 
.inal directions of the board for the guidance of their teachers in the 
matter. 
Resolutions, counter resolutions, and debates within the board, peti- 
tions and protests from without became the order of the day. The let- 
ters and petitions on the subject received by the board up to October 
12, 1893, were thus classified by a member, Mr. J. H. Gladstone: 
Forty-one letters of individuals or of 2 or 3 individuals combined; and 99 memo- 
rials of public bodies or of groups of at least 6 individuals. Taking the first cate- 
gory, 7 were in favor of the changes proposed in the regulations of the board, 34 
against; taking the second category, 11 were in favor, 86 against, 2 were doubtful; 
so that, taking the two categories together, there would seem to be numerically more 
than 6 to 1 against the proposed changes. 
In November the rumor arose that the school management committee 
of the board had agreed to advise that a circular be sent to the teach- 
ers explaining the sense in which they were to understand the word 
“Christian.” Therumor was confirmed early in February when the com- 
mittee submitted the proposed circular to the board. The document 
was kept under discussion for several meetings and finally adopted in 
an amended form as follows: 
Sir (or Mapam): In forwarding to you a copy of the rules of the board having ref- 
erence to Bible instruction and religious observances, I am directed to ask your 
thoughtful consideration of the following suggestions, in the hope that they may be 
useful for your guidance and direction: 
The Bible is your text-book, from which it has always been the desire of the board 
that you should give such explanations in the Christian religion and morality as are 
‘See “Religion—at the London School Board” (Nineteenth Century, November, 
1893). ‘The London School Board—a reply to Hon. Lyulph Stanley” (Nineteenth 
Century, December, 1893).
-P-A-G-E-221
  ELEMENTARY EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN. 211 
suited to the capacities of children of various ages attending the schoo!s of the board. 
Such explanations and instruction should of course be based on the conception of 
human nature which the Bible presents, namely, that a man is a responsible being 
with distinct and definite duties to God, to himself, and to his fellow-man. Under- 
standing child nature as you do, you will of course adapt your teaching to the 
various motives by which children are influenced; the object and purpose of all 
education being the formation of habits, mental, moral, and religious. And it is 
important to this end that the character of the children committed to your care 
should be studied individually, so as to correct the defects and encourage and stim- 
ulate the good points in each. 
The lessons adapted to an infant school are not the same as those which are suit- 
able to children of a more advanced age, and there are subjects essentially connected 
with the well-being and happiness of the individual on which the greatest caution 
has to be observed; but instruction in morality should not shirk the consideration 
of the relations of man to all the conditions of his being, and the Bible lesson 
affords you opportunities of so discussing these questions with the elder children as 
to impress them with the paramount importance of being pure, sincere, and upright 
in their life. 
The board have never intended their teachers to diverge from the presentation of 
the Christian religion which is revealed in the Bible. While following the syllabus 
which is suggested to you yearly, you are at liberty to refer to other parts of the 
Bible, by which the principles of the Christian religion may be elucidated and 
enforced. These principles include a belief in God the Father as our Creator, in 
God the Son as our Redeemer, and in God the Holy Ghost as our Sanctifier. 
The board ean not approve of any teaching which denies either the Divine or the 
human nature of the Lord Jesus Christ, or which leaves on the minds of the chil- 
dren any other impression than that they are bound to trust and serve Him as their 
God and Lord. 
‘The board desire that in giving the Bible lesson you will strictly observe, both in 
letter and spirit, the provisions of sections 7 and 14 of the elementary education act 
of 1870, and that you will make no attempt whatever to attach the children to any 
particular religious denomination. 
A question having been raised as to whether, under the heading of religious 
observances, the board permit the use of hymns, concluding with the Doxology or 
prayers other than the Lord’s Prayer, I am directed to inform you that no restriction 
is placed upon your liberty of choice in this respect. 
These suggestions are made by the board in no spirit of distrust or want of confi- 
dence in your good intentions to make the Bible lesscn as useful as possible, but in 
order to avoid any misconceptions which may exist as to the meaning and intention 
of the board’s rules with reference to a portion of their work upon which they lay 
the greatest stress. If there are those among you who can not conscientiously impart 
Bible instruction in this spirit, means will be taken, without prejudice to their posi- 
tion under the board, to release them from the duty of giving the Bible lesson. 
The religious opinions of candidates will not in any way influence their appoint- 
ment or promotion. 
The significance of the circular is emphasized by explanations of its 
intent brought out at subsequent meetings of the board. For example, 
in the meeting of April 26, 1894, Rev. Copeiand Bowie, who had voted 
against the circular, put the following questions to Mr, Athelstan Riley 
and others: 
(1) Does the circular, in your opinion, render it incumbent upon teachers who 
conscientiously believe that the doctrine of the Trinity is nowhere to be found in 
the Bible to discontinue giving Scripture lessons in the schools of the board? 
(2) Is a teacher, who holds Jesus in loving reverence as the bravest, noblest, 
purest Son of God the world has seen, but who does not believe that he was  
-P-A-G-E-222
  272. EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Almighty God, incompetent to give a Bible lesson under the terms of the cirewlar, 
even though the teacher in question scrupulously avoids all controversial theology ?% 
The replies were as follows: 
Mr. Riley: 
(1) Yes; I take that to be the force of the circular as explanatory of the rule. 
(2) Yes, as above. Mr. Bowie puts the fundamental difference between the 
»Christian and Unitarian religions with admirable clearness. To allow the children, 
as they pass through the hands of different teachers, to be taught to regard Jesus 
Christ first in one aspect and then in the other would be an outrage on Christian 
and Unitarian parents alike. It is generally held that one common religion should 
be taught throughout the board schools, and in this case, as it is impossible to get 
a religion which trims between these two, it is clear that the board must choose the 
Christian, which is the religion of the majority of the English people. Unitarian 
parents, knowing the character of the board’s teaching, can avail themselves of the 
conscience clause. As it appears to be the general wish of people outside and inside 
the board that the ‘‘compromise”’ i. e., the common religion, should be maintained, 
I have always expressed myself willing to support this if it is made clear that this 
religion is Christian in the sense of containing those fundamental tenets of the 
Christian religion upon which churchmen and Christian nonconformists are agreed. 
Iam not, however, responsible for the policy of a common religion, so I can not be 
held responsible for its results. Personally, Iam notin favor of having only one 
kind of religious teaching in the schools; considering the widely differing beliefs of 
parents, such a practice appears to me to lack the elements of justice. 
This view was ably advocated by Dr. Martineau, the respected leader of the Uni- 
tarian body, in a letter to the Times of May 4. Here are Dr. Martineau’s words: 
“The error of the past, then, has been the attempt to fit a uniform system of relig- 
ious instruction to the wants of so variegated a whole as the population of a London 
school district. If you satisfy the ecclesiastical standard, you wrong the miscella- 
neous host of unattached, yet not irreligious, people. If you insist on the latitude 
necessary to make the best of their religious proclivities, you disappoint the genuine 
church disciples of the indispensable nurture of their piety. The simpie remedy is 
to recognize the different requirements of their consciences and make distinct pro- 
vision for each. In any school worked under the 1871 rule this may be done by 
adding a department to the religious teaching conformed to Mr. Athelstan Riley’s 
restrictive condition, without prejudice to freedom established elsewhere. I do not 
see why he and his friends should not have all they desire, provided they are content 
with the consideration justly due to their own consciences and refrain from all 
unfriendly attitude toward the different ideas and usages of their copartners. If, in 
deference to the special requirements of the Jews, arrangements ef different types 
have been thought admissible in different schools, there seems nothing to forbid the 
coexistence of similar though minor varieties within the same school.” 
Dr. Martineau, it will be observed, agrees with me. I have no doubt the time is 
not far distant when sensible people of all religions will come round to our opinion.     
  Rev. Rowland Plummer: 
It is for the individual teacher to decide as his conscience may direct, but in my 
opinion no man can conscientiously teach as an article of faith that which he 
believes untrue; therefore, if he asked me, I should advise him to take advantage of 
the extension of liberty granted by the circular and apply to be excused Scripture 
lessons, without prejudice to his present position or future promotion. . 
- Mr. Sharp: 
In my opinion, the circular relieves a teacher who denies the Divinity of our Lord 
and Saviour Jesus Christ from the duty of giving Bible instructions under the rules 
of the board.
-P-A-G-E-223
‘ELEMENTARY EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN. 213 
Mr. Bowie asked the chairman of the Scripture subcommittee: 
(1) Are teachers who are unable to assent to the tritheism set forth in the cireular 
incompetent to give lessons from the Bible? / 
(2) In your speech at the board you said: ‘ Of course, the circular is a test.” Is 
it proposed to apply the test in the case of teachers who conscientiously believe that 
the religion of Jesus is best summed up in the doctrines of the fatherhood of God 
and the brotherhood of man? 
(3) Teachers are required to give lessons from a specially prepared ‘syllabus. Do 
the expressions “God the Son” and ‘‘Ged the Holy Ghost” occur in any chapters or 
verses of the Bible set down in the syllabus? Ifso, where? 
(4) If the expressions ‘God the Son” and ‘‘God the Holy Ghost” are unscriptural 
phrases, is it propesed to teach the children these dogmas under the pretense that 
they are contained in the Bible? 
    
  The Rev. John Coxhead, chairman of the Scripture subcominittee: 
(1) The regulations under which teachers are expected to work are clearly set forth 
in the rules of the board, and are definitely explained in circulars sent to the teach- 
ers under the authority of the board when such explanations seem to be required. 
(2) The committee of the board, and not individual members, administer the rules 
of the board. 
For the answer which Mr. Copeland Bowie appears to require for 3 and 4 I would 
refer him to Pearson on the Creed and to a more recent book, The Faith of the Gos- 
pel, by the Rev. Canon Mason, (School Board Chronicle, April 28, 1894, pp. 449, 450.) 
  It need hardly be said that the circular is regarded in many quarters 
as a religious test applied to teachers, and, as such, is vehemently 
opposed, 
The National Union of Elementary Teachers, the great body of Wes- 
~ leyan Methodists, are strong in their denunciations. The difficulties 
in the way of giving practical effect to the circular are indicated by the 
fact that 3,150 teachers employed by the board, or nearly half the entire 
body, have asked to be relieved from giving religious instruction under 
the new conditions. The request, with the signatures appended, was 
forwarded to the board by the secretary of the Metropolitan Teachers’ 
Association. Instead of replying through the same medium, the board 
decided that— 
The school management committee be authorized to address a letter to each of the 
signatories to the memorial forwarded by Mr. T. Gautrey, inquiring whether they 
desire to be relieved from the duty of giving Bible instruction, in accordance with 
the following sentence of the circular, dated 15th April, 1894, referring to Bible 
instructions: S 
“Tf there are those among you who can not conscientiously impart Bible instruc- 
tion in this spirit, means will be taken, without prejudice to their position under 
the board, to release them from the duty of giving the Bible lesson.” 
The association at once called a meeting to protest against this deci- 
sion. The call was responded to by 1,500 members, who unanimously 
adopted the following manifesto: 
This large meeting, on behalf of the 3,150 signatories asking to be relieved from 
giving religious instruction until the cirenlar be withdrawn, hereby respectfully 
decides, and recommends the absent signatories to do likewise, not to reply individ- 
ually to the board’s individual request. They take this step with reluctance and a

    214 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
due sense 0. 1ts gravity. They made the applications to be relieved in proper form 
and after mature consideration, and to these applications they have nothing to add 
and from them nothing to subtract. As experts, they are convinced that the intro- 
duction into the schools of the definite dogmatic teaching desired by the leaders in 
this movement is both unsuitable and unwarranted. They feel strongly that the 
religious instruction should aim at the formation of character and the inculcation 
of the principles of morality rather than supplying doctrinal teaching, which is best 
left for a more mature age. Instruction of the former character they haye given in 
the past from the open Bible, and, as they are denied the relief promised on applica- 
tion, they will continue to give such instruction in the future, withont reference to 
the circular. 
They are still of opinion that the operation of the circular will amount to the 
application of a test, and they agree with the Rev. Dr. Abbott (late of the city of 
London school) that a ‘‘teacher who will conform, will be more useful than one who 
will not, and in the end, the former will have his reward in better pay and quicker 
promotion,” and ‘‘that a new kind of ‘dissent’ will thus be started; and ‘school 
board nonconformists’ will find themselves gradually drifting out of the swim of 
professional advancement.” 
They also respectfully resent the board’s action in treating their applications as 
if they were not bona fide, and because they were sent through the Metropolitan 
Board Teachers’ Association. They can only interpret the board’s action as an 
attempt to break up their organization, and this they are determined to resist at all 
haza 1d 
In conclusion, they much regret to have to assume an attitude of apparent oppo- 
sition to the board’s wishes, and they still earnestly hope the board will see its way 
to withdraw the circular, and allow the instruction to continue on the lines and 
with the great success which has hitherto attended it. (Schoolmaster, July 14, 
1894, p. 55.) 
At this crisis the executive of the National Union of Elementary: 
Teachers, an association representing the collective body of English 
teachers, also sent a memorial to the board which reviews the situa- 
tion in a judicial but emphatic manner. This memorial is as follows: 
The executive of the National Union of Teachers observe with profound regret 
that recent action by the London school board has brought the question of religious 
education into public dispute. 
For twenty-three years the subject had been settled upon the peaceable basis 
of compromise; in practice its theoretical differences and perplexities have been 
obviated or solved; and, in point of fact, the so-called ‘‘religious difficulty” had 
ceased to exist. With sorrow and foreboding, therefore, the executive have seen 
this delicate matter flung anew into the arena of public polemics and sectarian 
strife. A war of creeds has been incurred; the healing influences of time and tact- 
ful teaching have been arrested, and a debate has recommenced that can not proceed 
afresh without fresh wounds to religion and further hindrance to the schools. 
Deploring this prospect, the executive, in the name of the teachers, make solemn 
protest against action so perilous and incendiary, With full knowledge of the 
nature and quality of the religious instruction imparted, they declare that there is 
no parental demand or justification for change. They venture to think that none 
can speak with more experience of the facts than the teachers themselves; and the 
teachers are aware that the instruction has been such as Christian theologians could 
collectively indorse. They know that the scholars have becn carefully and rever- 
ently taught the essentials of the Christian faith as drawn from Holy Scripture. 
They know that the syllabus of instruction in use in the board schools is a compen- 
dium of the fundamentals of Christianity; that the children have learned’ by heart 
   
-P-A-G-E-225
  ELEMENTARY EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN. 215 
  the Lord’s Prayer, the Ten Commandments, and many of the choicest passages from 
the Gospels, the Epistles, the Psalms, the Proverbs, the Pentateuch, and the Prophets; 
that lessons have been regularly given on the life, parables, miracles, and the divin- 
ity of Christ; the Four Gospels; the Epistles of St. Paul, St. John, and St. James; 
the Acts of the Apostles; the Psalms, the Proverbs, the Prophecies of Isaiah and © 
Jeremiah; the Pentateuch, the Books of Joshua, Judges, Ruth, Samuel, and Kings; 
the lives of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Samuel, and David, the life and law of 
Moses. f 
They know that all this has been faithfully expounded according to the capacities 
of the children, and that the parents who have claimed the exemptions of the con- 
science clause are infinitesimally few. They have known that the religious lessons 
and observances in London board schools (as in the schools elsewhere) have always 
won high commendation from parents, inspectors, clergy and ministers of all 
denominations. They are further aware that three-fourths of the teachers in ques- 
tion have been taught and trained in schools and colleges controlled by the clergy 
of the Church of England, and of those equipped at other colleges at least one- 
third were members of that church. They know that without exception the other 
teachers were trained in schools or colleges wherein religious observances obtained. 
They also know that the prayers and hymns used in board schools are prayers and 
hymns appointed for the services of the Church of England or other Christian 
denominations. In short, the executive feel that the teachers in London board 
schools may fairly claim to have taught the faith with knowledge, in unity of spirit 
and the bond of love. 
With indignation, therefore, the executive have seen the respectful protests of 
associated teachers against the initiation of dogmatic creeds and tests construed by 
some to mean a hatred of the ethical part of a teacher’s duty, and an atheistic or 
agnostic attitude of mind. The teachers resent and repudiate the charge. So far 
from seeking to subvert religious instruction in the schools, the teachers have, by 
tact and care, made its continuance practicable. But they fear that its continuance 
will become impracticable if varying interpretations of the Word, by varying 
boards, are to take the place of the system that has worked so well hitherto. The 
authority of one theological circular would be destroyed by the issue of another, 
and orthodoxy would become heterodox at every change of government in the 
board. ‘To fluctuate from one set 6f tenets to another, and from that to a third, and 
back again, must lead to contemptuous unbelief, confusion, and revolt, and thus to 
the secularization of board schools; whilst the prohibition of religious teaching in 
board schools would rapidly induce the secularization of all State-aided schools and 
colleges. Already the-action of the board has greatly strengthened the argument 
that religion should be taught only in other places and ways. 
Already, also, the impression has been created that insistence on theological knowl- 
edge means treason to the interests of general education. While protracted and 
bitter debates on the compromise and the circular have occupied the attention of 
the board, defects and evils in the schools have not received due attention. Children 
have been left without schools, schools without sufficient teachers, and health and 
study have been allowed to suffer from insanitary buildings, dirty rooms, and classes 
cruelly large. 
But there are further grounds for this protest. The action of the board in refusing 
to accept the teachers’ collective claim to liberty of conscience resembles an attempt 
by a powerful body to oppress individuals who are not so powerful. Duty to each 
other demands that teachers in board schools should withstand denominational tests 
that might withhold from any section of themselves the ordinary opportunities for 
professional employment and promotion. And, finally, there is serious danger of the 
mischief set afoot in London extending to the provinces. At present the conflagra- 
tion is mainly local to the metropolis, but there are already symptoms of a conta- 
gious spread of the evil elsewhere. The example set by London would doubtless be 
     
-P-A-G-E-226
  216 "EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. - 
copied, though the circulars would differ according to localities, and might often 
define Christianity in terms at variance with those of the circular issued by the 
London board. 
Respectfully, but earnestly, therefore, the executive again appeal that the circu- 
Jar may be withdrawn, in the interests of religion and education. (School Board 
Chronicle, September 15, 1894, p. 270.) 
At present the controversy within the school board is eclipsed by the 
agitatious of an election campaign. In accordance with the law a new 
triennial board comes into power in December. The religious question 
is the issue before the voters and their action must determine its further 
developments. 
An interesting complication has arisen in the progress of the matter 
before the London board from the discovery of or rather the prominence 
given to the modifications of the scheme of religious instruction in its 
application to the Jewish schools. 
As stated by Mr. Diggle, chairman of the London board, in explaining 
the action of the board, it was “found impossible to fill a school in the 
East End until they appointed Jewish teachers.” Under these circum- 
stances the absolute necessity of adjusting biblical instruction to the 
conscientious scruples of the teacher and parents is evident. Hence 
the board sanctioned a syllabus drawn up for the Jewish schools by * 
the chief rabbi, Dr. Adler. In this the lessons from the New Testa- 
ment are omitted and the Hebrew Scriptures are used. 
It is claimed that the concession is made on historical grounds only, 
and that Jewish teachers use the syllabus in the undenominational 
spirit. Naturally their ecclesiastical rivals are not inclined to take so 
neutral a view, and a pressure has been brought to bear upon the 
Government with a view to securing the repeal of section 14 of the 
law of 1870. A bill to this effect and providing also for denominational 
instruction under specified conditions was introduced into the House 
of Lords, May, 1893, by the Bishop of Salisbury. These conditions 
are identical with those in vogue in several continental countries and 
often advocated in the United States. The oojections to them are 
stated very clearly by Dr. J. G. Fitch in an article in the Nineteenth 
Century for July, 1894. On this point he says: 
Among the expedients most frequently suggested by those who are dissatisfied 
with the present arrangements is one which would provide that at certain hours, set 
apart for the special purpose, the ministers of the various churches should be asked 
to form classes, composed of the children of their several flocks, and to give them 
the distinctive instruction proper to their several creeds, There is at first sight a 
plausible show of fairness in this suggestion, but in practice it has never succeeded 
well, and there are excellent reasons why it never could succeed in a community like 
ours, for, in the first place, the clergy have not always the time or the will to 
undertake the work. The best of them are preoccupied with other duties. If they 
are to be paid, the expense will be considerable, and it would not be likely that 
Parliament would sanction the payment from the rates. If they are to be unpaid, 
their attendance will be desultory and uncertain, and subject to such frequent inter- 
ruption as to dislocate seriously the organization of the school. But even if their 
attendance could be secured the results would be very unsatisfactory. 
 
-P-A-G-E-227
  
  ELEMENTARY EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN. 217 
It is no disparagement to the ministers of religion to say of them that, as a rule, 
they are ill suited to be the teachers of young children. Their habits of mind and 
the peculiar nature of their pastoral work unfit them for this duty—a duty requir- 
ing special skill and insight and a kind of tact in the presentation of truth to 
young minds which is only to be gained by exceptional training and experience. 
Moreover, the fact that the minister was employed as the representative of a par- 
ticular church would lead him to accentuate those points of difference which dis- 
tinguish that church from others, and thus there would be introduced among the 
children visible sectarian divisions, which would have the most unedifying effect on 
the social and moral character of the school. But the most serious result of such 
an araugement would be the degradation of the teacher’s office. 
To supersede him in regard to the one subject of instruction which is presumably 
of the highest importance would be to deprive him of much of his moral influence 
and to lower him in the eyes of the scholars. He is, after all, a qualified teacher. 
He knows better than anyone else is likely to know what is the nature of childhood, 
and what are the most approved methods of finding access to the understanding, the 
conscience, and the sympathies of those whom he teaches. He has no denomina- 
tional interests to serve, but he is responsible for the general education of his scholars 
and for their moral training; and his scriptural instruction, therefore, is likely to be 
more effective and more appropriate than that of a stranger, because it will be part 
of a rounded and well-ordered scheme of intellectual training, and not a purpureus 
pannus, patched on at an extra time, and having no organic connection with the 
rest of the school course. Such well-meant efforts as those of the Bishop of Salisbury, 
in his abortive Dill of last session, proceed on two assumptions: (1) That the parents, 
as a rule, belong to some religious denomination or other; and (2) that they desire 
to have denominational instruction imparted in the day school. Both hypotheses 
will be found on closer inquiry to be untenable (p. 66). 
Subsequently the House of Lords ordered a “return of the regula- 
tions with regard to religious instruction” from all school boards, to 
secure which the department of education, June, 1894, issued a schedule 
of inquiry to be filled out by each board. The questions which it com- 
prises are as follows: 
  (1) Is any religious teaching or religious observance practiced or given in the 
schools of the board? 
(2) Are any hyrnns or prayers used? 
(3) Is the Bible read (with or without comment thereon)? 
(4) State the time (if any) allotted to each subject. 
(5) Give the syllabus of religious instruction. 
(6) Give the rules (if any) for-annual examination in religious knowledge. 
(7) A copy of the regulation of the board, in pursuance of which the religious 
observances and instruction are carried out, should be furnished. 
(8) Ifno formal regulation has been passed, state the practice of the schools under 
the board. (School Board Chronicle July, 14, 1894.) 
  At this point the whole matter rests, waiting the results of the 
school-board elections in November. 
MOVEMENTS AFFECTING SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
The most important event of the year with respect to secondary 
education was the conference held at Oxford October 11 and 12. The 
delegates were men and women of distinction in the educational or 
political world. Oxford, Cambridge, London, and Durham universities,  
-P-A-G-E-228

the university colleges, and the endowed schools were all well repre- 
sented, The main subject before the conference was that of the State 
organization of secondary schools, and the speakers very naturally 
kept in view the lines on which secondary instruction in England 
divides. 
The practical outcome of the conference was an agreement that an 
inquiry commission should precede legislation affecting secondary 
schools. The recent announcement that the commission is to be 
appoiuted gives general satisfaction.

France, Republic.—Area, 204,092 square miles. Population (actual) April 12, 1891, 
38,095,156; domiciled or legal, 38,343,192. 
Civil divisions.—For purposes of civil government France is divided into &6 depart- 
ments (90if Algiers be included), each haying its local legislative assembly, which 
is formed by election. The departments are subdivided into arrondissements, and 
these into cantons. The smallest civil divisions comprised within the cantons are 
communes. 
The present Government of France maintains a system of education 
which preserves many of the administrative features of the Imperial 
University. Authority is centralized in a cabinet officer, the minister 
of public instruction and fine arts The expenses of the service are 
covered by an annual appropriation from the State, which receives into 
its treasury the local appropriations for the service and the receipts 
from tuition fees. 
All appointments to the service, whether official or professional, are 
made either by the minister or by the President of the Republie, 
excepting only in the case of elementary teachers, who are appointed 
by the heads of departments (prefects, themselves appointed by the 
President). The officers of administration form an educational hier- 
archy, entrance into whichis secured not alone by favor, but upon proof 
of special qualifications; promotions in the same are generally the 
reward of distinguished service or the recognition of superior merit. 
Officials, professors, and teachers all receive their salaries from the 
State. The control of the system is facilitated by its organization into 
three great departments—primary, which includes infant schools (ages 
2 to 6), primary schools (elementary aud superior, ages 6 to 13), adult 
eeu and normal schoo!s toy Es teachers; secondary, to which

belong the lycées and communal colleges; superior, which comprises 
the faculties for liberal and professional training, and special schools.! 
Each department has its own chief or director, its separate budget and 
distinct body of laws, decrees, ete. The academies (17 in number) are 
local districts of educational administration. 
Each académie forms a scholastic unit, whose chief (recteur) is the 
official head of all the teaching institutions located within its bounds. 
The possession of a doctor’s degree is an essential qualification for the 
rectorship. 
The 90 departments (districts of civil administration) are treated as 
subdivisions of the académies in respect to educational affairs, the 
_prefects of departments having a measure of control over primary and 
normal schools. 
The supervision of secondary instruction is intrusted to general in- 
spectors, at present 10 in number, and that of primary instruction to a 
_ graded series of inspectors, (1) general inspectors, including 9 assigned 
to particular sections of the country, several assigned to the oversight 
of special branches of study, and general inspectresses of infant schools. 
These officials report directly to the minister as to the manner in which 
the educational law is carried out, (2) Academic inspectors (inspec- 
teurs Wacadémies), one for each department, who are subordinate to 
the rectors. They have the general direction of primary schools, con- 
duct examinations for teachers’ certificates, appoint all teachers on 
probation, and name the candidates from whom the prefects of depart- 
ments may appoint full teachers. (3) Primary inspectors, at present 
about 450 in. number, or 1 for every 150 primary schools. They inspect 
the work of individual schools, and report to the academic inspector. 
(4) Medical inspectors, whose duties include the examination of children 
with respect to their physical condition and of sites and buildings with 
respect to sanitary particulars. There are also inspectresses of board- 
ing schools for girls. It should be observed that all these officials must 
have access also to private schools. 
The scholastic work of the system is regulated by law or by official 
decrees which embody the matured opinions of the superior council of 
education, a representative body of 60 members, three-fourths of whom 
are elected by their peers from the various orders of public instruction, 
the remainder*being appointed by the President. The council is not 
only an advisory, but. also a judicial body, being the final court of 
1The special schools which are under the exclusive control of the minister of pub- 
lic instruction and fine arts are the Collége de France, Muséum @’Histoire Naturelle, 
Feole Normale Supérieure, Ecole Frangaise de Rome, Ecole Frangaise d’Athénes, 
Ecole Nationale des Chartes, cole Spéciale des Langues Orientales Vivantes, Ecole

  appeal in certain cases of contention; as, for example, cases of the re- 
moval of teachers by local-authorities. Paris is the seat of the council, - 
whose deliberations are presided over by the minister. The academic 
vectors have the advice of academic councils composed of inspecteurs 
@académies, professors, and teachers; finally, the prefects are assisted 
by departmental councils. These several councils save the work of 
public education, to some degree at least, from the mechanical routine 
which is one danger of a highly centralized system. 
As regards primary schools, the direct interest of the people is 
enlisted in several ways. The law of 1833 made it obligatory upon 
every commune to establish a public school, which under the law of 
June 16, 1881, must be a free school, and under laws of 1882 and 1886, _ 
secular, and taught by a lay teacher. A commune, it must be remem- 
bered, is the si uplest civil division in France. Its local affairs are con- 
trolled by a council and a mayor chosen from the members of the same. 
A commune may have less than 20 inhabitants; it may be a populous 
city. Paris, indeed, is a commune, although differing somewhat from 
others in its form of local government. Large or small the commune 
must establish a free primary school, provide the site and building and 
a portion of the current expenditure; not only so, but every commune 
of more than 500 inhabitants must have a separate school for girls. 
(Laws of March 15, 1850, and April 10, 1867.) 
Since, however, many communes are too small and too poor to obey 
the law, and others require stimulating, the State has been exceedingly 
liberal with subsidies to help in the initial steps. The subsidies and 
advances for this purpose amounted in the decade 1878-1888 te 
$105,000,000. 
In order that the communes should perform their part, provision 
must be made for concerted action. Hence the departmental councils 
appoint delegates to confer with the communal authorities and with 
the primary inspectors as to sites, buildings, material, ete. The mayors 
of communes have free access to the schools at all times; their duties 
and those of the delegates are much like those of our district school 
committees, excepting that they have no control over teachers or pro- 
grammes. It is incumbent also upon communes to maintain funds 
(caisses des écoles) for the assistance of indigent pupils. Although the 
law (March 28, 1882) obliges parents to secure the instruction of their 
children, they can make choice of the means, i. e., public schools, pri- 
vate schools, home tuition. 
Official statistics—No complete statistics of education in France have 
been published since 1889.1 The following statistics relative to the 
most important operations of the system are, however, from official 
sources of later date.     
    
‘In that year the minister submitted the following reports: ‘Statistique de en’ 
seignement primarie, 1886-87,” secondaire 1887, supérieur 1878-1888.

222 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  Finances.—The State appropriation for education in 1893 was 
$33,699,943. Estimates submitted to the Chamber of Deputies by the 
financial committee for 1894 showed an increase of $1,204,852. 
The sum allowed in 1893 was distributed as follows: For administra- 
tion, 2.3 per cent; department of superior instruction, 10.3 per cent; of 
secondary, 9.6 per cent; of primary, 77.8 per cent. (Rapport de la com- 
mission du budget chargée d’examiner le projet de loi portant fixation 
du budget général de lexercice 1893.) 
The amount of the appropriation represents approximately the ex- 
penditure for public education in that year, as the receipts from fees in 
secondary and superior institutions and the amount raised by the obli- 
gatory communal school tax are paid into the public treasury. Incomes 
from other sources, i. e., gifts, legacies, etc., are retained by the institu- 
tions or by the local authorities. 
The total expenditure for public primary schools (infant included) in 
1890 was 162,681,805 franes ($32,536,361). Of this amount 64.8 per cent 
was contributed by the State and the balance by the communes. The 
marked increase in the relative proportion derived from the State (it was 
50.6 per cent in 1889 as against 64.7 in 1890) is due to the fact that the 
State has assumed the responsibility of paying the salaries of teachers. 
In 1892 the expenditure rose to 171,395,206 franes ($34,279,041), the 
proportionate parts of the State and communes being the same as in 
1890. (Résumé des Etats de situation de Venseignement primaire,

PUBLIC SECONDARY SCHOOLS FOR GIRLS. 
In 1891 there were 11,645 students in the public secondary schools 
for girls, i. e., lycées (State schools), 29; communal colleges, 26; sec- 
ondary courses (or departments), 61. 
To the foregoing may be added 21,230 boys and 7,579 girls in the 
higher primary schools. (Report of financial committee of the Cham- 
ber of Deputies, commission of budget, ete., 1893, pp. 43, 60, 67.)

From a further classification it appears that the lay schools number 
64,000, with an enrollment of 3,900,977 pupils, and clerical 18,533, with 
an enrollment of 1,655,493. M. Levasseur notes that there has been a 
decline of 37,413 in the total enrollment since 1890-91.

Infant schools (écoles maternelles), which are not included in the 
above statement, excepting only in the financial showing, numbered 5,411 
in 1891-92, of which 2,603 were public and 2,808 private. The former 
had 5,140 teachers and an enrollment of 456,008 pupils; the latter 3,613 
teachers and 250,571 pupils, or a total teaching force of 8,753, and a 
total enrollment of 706,579. The inspection of these schools is intrusted 
to persons specially qualified for the work. The office is indebted to 
M. F. Buisson, director of primary instruction in the ministry of public 
instruction, for the following statement as to the conduct of this service: 
INSPECTION OF INFANT SCHOOLS (ECOLES MATERNELLES) IN FRANCE. 
In addition to the inspectors of primary instruction, the persons employed to 
inspect or simply visit the infant schools (écoles maternelles) are the inspectresses- 
general, the primary inspectresses of girls’ schools, the departmental inspectresses, 
and the women belonging to the local committee (comités de patronage). 
Js 
Inspectresses-general are 4 in number, and are appointed by the minister. The 
conditions required for the position are the following: 
‘The applicant must be at least 35 years of age and must have had five years’ serv- 
ice in public or private instruction and must have received a certificate of aptitude 
for the inspection of infant schools. (Order of January 18, 1887, Chap. V, arts. 183 
to 186.) 
The inspectresses-general are divided into three classes, with the following salaries: 
First class, $1,000 (5,000 francs); second class, $800 (4,000 francs); third class, $600 
(8,000 francs). Besides their salaries, they are allowed $4 (20 francs) a day and their 
traveling expenses while in the performance of duty pertaining to their office. 
The inspectresses-general make the circuit of the territory assigned te them. They 
inspect the infant schools, both public and private, but their inspection of the pri- 
vate schools is confined to hygienic and moral conditions. They make a detailed 
report of their work each year to the minister of public instruction, to whom they 
are all responsible. 
aT 
PRIMARY INSPECTRESS. 
The service of primary inspectress is of recent date, having been instituted by the 
law of July 19, 1889. It exists only in the department of the Seine and Oise, and is 
there in reality only in the nature of an experiment. There is only one inspectress, 
and she confines her work to the infant schools for girls in this single department. 
Ill. 
DEPARTMENTAL INSPECTRESSES OF INFANT SCHOOLS. 
These are appointed by the minister, but are found only in those departments 
which engage to pay one half of the salaries, the other half being paid by the 
State Two or three departments may unite to bear this expense, dividing it 
equally. 
The department of the Seine employs five departmental inspectresses, bearing the 
entire expense of their service. Applicants for these positions must be 30 years of 
age and must have had three years’ experience in teaching. They must also have 
received a certificate of aptitude for the inspection of infant schools. 
These inspectresses are divided into three classes, with the following salaries: 
First class, $480 (2,400 franes); second class, $450 (2,200 irancs); third class, $400 
(2,000 francs)
-P-A-G-E-235

Besides her salary each inspectress is allowed a minimum amount of $100 while in 
actual performance of her duties when she has charge of only one department, and 
a minimum of $200 when several departments are under her inspection. This allow- 
ance includes the traveling expenses. r 4 
The inspectresses of the infant schools are under the authority of the academie 
inspectors, who determine their circuit. They visit each school at least twice a year 
and make a special report of each inspection. They advise concerning the appoint- 
ment and dismissal of directresses and subdirectresses of the public infant schools, 
and also as to their salaries,

LOCAL COMMITTEES (COMITS DE PATRONAGE). 
One or more local committees of women may be created in each department or 
commune where there is a public infant school. 
The members of these committees are appointed for three years by the academie 
inspector upon the advice of the mayor, who presides over the committee. 
Their duties are confined exclusively to watching over the hygienic conditions of 
the schools, their good management, as well as the use of the funds or gifts collected 
for the children. (Decision of January 18, 1887.)

PROGRAMME OF THE EXAMINATION FOR THE CERTIFICATE OF APTITUDE FOR THE 
INSPECTION OF INFANT SCHOOLS. 
  ARTICLE 185, The examination consists of a written, an oral, and a practical test. 
There are two written tests: 
First. A composition on pedagogy applied to the infant schools. (Time allowed, 
three hours.) 
Second. A composition upon the hygiene of infant schools (care to give to the 
children, building, and premises). ! (Three hours.) 
The oral test consists of questions: 
First. On pedagogy applied to infant schools and on hygiene. 
Second. On the laws pertaining to the administration of these schools. 
The practical test consists of an inspection of an infant school and an oral report 
of this inspection. 
SUMMARY OF RECENT MEASURES AFFECTING SECONDARY INSTRUC- 
TION. 
As regards the department of secondary instruction, comprising the 
lycées and communal colleges, the efforts of the past two years have 
been directed to giving effect to the decrees of August 8, 1890, and 
Jue 4, 1891, which were considered in full in the Commissioner’s report 
for 1890-91.” 
To summarize briefly, these measures, so far as they relate to the 
internal conduct of the schools, are intended to lessen the strain of 
overcrowded programmes, to break up mechanical routine, to stimu- 
late the free initiative of individual institutions, and to elevate the 
scholastic standards of the ‘‘ modern course.” 
‘Hygiene of the building and premises, choice of site with reference to the sun- 
light, ventilation, lighting, heating, furnishing, sanitation, Javatories, baths, hygiene 
of the children; feeding, clothing, contagious maladies \ procedure with respect to), 
evils arising from defective hygiene.

-P-A-G-E-236
226 EDUUATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  The most obvious purpose of the new measures is to effect an impor- 
tant change in the bachelor’s degree, which is the goal of the classical 
course of the lyeées. For the three degrees established in 1865 (bacca- 
lauréat és lettres, baccalauréat és sciences complet, baccalauréat és 
sciences restreint), and secured by examinations essentially different, 
there is substituted a single bachelor’s degree requiring the same 
preparation on the part of all candidates. Election is allowed simply 
in the last year (i. ¢., philosophie) of the lycée course between three 
equivalent lines of study, and in accordance with the choice the diploma 
is inscribed as “ Lettres, philosophie;” “Lettres, mathématiques;” or 
“ Lettres, sciences physiques ef; naturelles.” 
The nonclassical secondary course established in 1865 under the 
name enseignement secondaire special is now termed enseignement 
secondaire moderne, and the diploma to which it leads, baccalauréat de 
Yenseignement secondaire moderne. This diploma, like the classical, 
may bear one of three inscriptions: “Lettres, philosophie;” “Lettres, 
sciences;” or “ Lettres, mathématiques.” 
Measures affecting the faculties.—As regards the department of supe- 
rior instruction, the project of law for transforming the faculties into 
autononous universities, which was considered in full in the Commis- 
sioner’s last report,’ is still under debate. Meanwhile the development 
of courses of study, the inerease of equipments, the extension and 
deepening of professional courses, or, in brief, the transformation of the 
scholastic work in the spirit of university ideals, continues. Special 
importance attaches to the measures affecting the medical faculties, 
The purpose of these measures is indicated in official decrees bear- 
ing date July 31, 1893. These decrees provide for the reorganization 
of the medical courses and for a new course in the sciences pertaining 
to medical studies to be organized in the faculty of sciences. They 
are the outcome of special inquiries instituted from time to time by the 
Government, the last in 1892. The impulse to these inquiries came 
from the faculties of medicine, who complained that their students had 
not adequate preliminary preparation, either in the principles of science 
or in laboratory practice. They urged that the chairs of chemistry, 
physics, and natural history created in the faculties of medicine them- 
selves were not intended for general instruction in science nor for 
training in methods of investigation, but as a means of making known 
the medical applications of science and of scientific methods. The 
professors supported their complaint by the statistics of the prelimi- 
nary examinations for the doctor’s degree, which showed that more than 
a third, often one-half, of the applicants failed in this test two or three 
times, and that a great number, discouraged by failure, gave up the 
effort to accomplish a medical course. 
In 1890 the Government sought the opinion of the faculties in respect 
to measures for remedying the evils complained of. As regards the 
+ 1891-92, pp. 76-95.
-P-A-G-E-237
  
EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 227 
scientific preparation, it was proposed that a special scientific course 
should be opened in the lyeées and a complementary course of one year 
in the faculties of science for students who intended to pursue medical 
studies. Further, that the course in medicine should be four years in 
duration. The response of the faculties to the official inquiry upon 
these points showed that while they were agreed as to the necessity of 
a special preparatory course in science, there were differences of opinion 
as to its proper place, i. e., whether in the lycées, the faculty of science, 
or divided between the two. 
The above résumé, drawn from the report of a commission appointed 
to elaborate measures for the proposed reform of the medical course, 
brings the history of the movement te 1892, the year of the final inquiry 
into the subject on the part of the Government. The further history is 
here presented in extracts from this report, which was submitted to 
the superior council by M. Brouardel, dean of the Paris faculty of 
medicine, and from the report of the commission on the proposed course 
in science submitted to the council by M. Darboux, dean of the Paris 
faculty of sciences. These reports, with the resulting decrees, afford a 
very clear idea of the conduct of medical students in France, and also 
of the relations that exist in the French system between general studies, 
whether organized in the lyeées or in the faculties, and professional 
studies. For the better understanding of the citations from the reports 
here considered it should be premised that medical instruction is the 
provinee of medical faculties, of full course schools having the same 
rank as the faculties, and of preparatory schools in which students may 
pass three years of the four required in the medical course.! 
In the ministerial eireular of May 9, 1892, the propositions to be con- 
sidered by the commissions were submitted as follows: 
(1) In the ‘faculties of sciences,” following the full secondary or lycée course 
(scientific), the organization of a year’s course in theoretical and practical studies 
comprising physics, chemistry, and natural history; this course to take the place of 
the baccalaureate of sciences limited (restreint)? and of the first year of the actual 
programme of the faculties of medicine. 
(2) The organization of a four years’ medical course so as to comprise therein the 
applications of physical and natural sciences to medicine, and such an adjustment 
of the examinations in these subjects as would bring a part of them into the period 
of medical study. 
Before proceeding directly to the consideration of these propositions 
M. Brouardel says, with respect to possible modification of the second- 
ary course of studies in the interests of students intending to follow a 
medical course: 
It is to he noted that as regards the organization of the medical studies and the 
scientific preparation necessary to these studies, the questions put to the faculties 
in 1890 and 1892 are identical; the difference is only as to the preliminary secondary

studies. In 1890 the question was, if these studies could not stop at the class of 
rhetoric, In 1892 it was admitted that they must be continued through the year of 
philosophy. This change is accounted for by two reasons: First, in the permanent 
section of the superior council numerous projects have been elaborated with a view 
to comprising, in a single year, the class of philosophy and the preparatory year of 
physical and natural sciences;'as this could not be satisfactorily arranged, the 
attempt was abandoned. Second, the faculties of medicine who had raised the 
question of the suppression or the transformation of the philosophical class, at last, 
by a great majority, decided against any modification of that class. * * * 
Proceeding then to the propositions before the commission, the 
reporter says with respect to the scientific studies preliminary to the 
medical : 
From the repiies to the circular of inquiry it appears that the faculties demand 
unanimously the organization of one year of preparatory study in the physical and 
natural sciences applicable to medicine, and, with a great majority, they desire that 
the same be organized in the faculties of sciences. , 
After having discussed the matter, your commission came to the conclusion that 
one of the principal causes of the failure of the previous efforts was the mixing of 
that which is general with what pertains specially to medicine in the same instruc- 
tion; and that this confusion had prevented that profit to the medical sciences which 
might have been expected from these studies. Therefore the commission believes 
that these two parts (i. e., general and special) should be separated definitely; that 
only pupils already sufficiently instructed in the physical and natural sciences should 
be permitted to enter into the faculties of medicine; that the instruction in these 
sciences should be organized in the faculties of medicine with an exclusively med- 
ical view, because they are convinced that the preparatory instruction maintained in 
the faculties and schools of medicine would resemble too much that which up to this 
time has not given satisfactory results. 
Passing then to the duration of studies, including in the term the pre- 
liminary general course and the strictly professional course, the report 
continues: : 
The faculties of medicine in demanding one year preparatory to the medical studies 
are well aware that, considering the entire course of study, they seem to increase by 
a year the time required under the present order. But they observe: 
(1) That if the duration of the period of study seems to be prolonged by a year, this 
is not the case with the actual duration of the medical studies. This appears from 
the examination of the records of the 663 doctors examined at Paris, 1888 and 1889. 
As regards the number of years spent in study, the records show the following: 
From 4 to 5 years. 
From 5 to 6 years. 
From 6 to 7 years. 
From 7 to 8 years. 
From 8 to 9 years. 
From 9 to 10 years

It is evident from this statement that, of these 663 physicians, above half had 
devoted more than seven years to their studies; some did this in order to prepare 
thoroughly for the examinations for positions in the civil hospitals (concours de 
Pinternat); these voluntarily, and with great profit, prolonged their studies; others

  who did not desire to compete for these positions availed themselves of the labora- 
tories freely placed at their disposal and frequented the special clinics; and, finally, 
others because their studies had been interrupted by sickness, misfortune, ete. 
For the better scholars the duration of professional studies varies between six and 
eight years, and in the case of those preparing for hospital service it extends often 
to ten years. 
With respect to the division of studies and examinations in the 
medical course the commission say: 
The student, on entering into the faculty of medicine, will begin at once the ana- 
tomical and clinical studies. In order to be ready for an examination in surgical 
and medical pathology at the time of the thirteenth inscription or act of enroll- 
ment (beginning of the fourth year), it is necessary that during the first three years 
he should pursue the hospital course (stage hospitalier). For the first two years he 
will take part in dissections in the winter semester; during the summer semester 
he will frequent the laboratories of histology, physiology, physics, chemistry, of 
medical natural history. As to these last sciences, they should be so distributed as 
to be pursued throughout the course, the time devoted to the demonstrations per- 
taining to each being properly related to the successive stages of the instruction. 
Thus optics and acoustics should be associated with physiology, and the student 
should be tested in these matters at the second examination. Medical electricity, so 
little understood by physicians, simply because it is not taught to the students at 
the moment when they might study its applications to the nervous system, should 
form part of the fourth examination (therapeutic). ; 
The chemistry of humors and of nutrition belongs medically to the programme of 
physiology; their alterations to that of general or special pathology; they should 
be taught during the third year of the course. The applications of chemistry to 
therapeutics, to materia medica, to hygiene, to legal medicine, belong to the fourth 
examination. Zoology, botany, and, above all, by reason of the part which they 
actually play in pathology and hygiene, animal and vegetative parasites must be 
studied for the third and fourth examinations. 
The practical laboratories actually attached to these chairs will serve to make the 
pupils familiar with the objects pertaining immediately to their studies. If some 
persons have feared that the instruction in sciences was to be abandoned, they have 
misunderstood the project. 
French scientists having accomplished such great things for the progress of med- 
ical science by their discoveries in physics and bacteriology, it would certainly never 
occur to one of us to eliminate these sciences from medical studies. But we believe 
that speaking of the medical applications of the sciences to those who do not know 
the elements of medicine is an error in method; to explain these applications at 
the moment when the students are occupied with physiology, pathology, therapeu- 
tics, would enhance the value of the instruction and, I will add, is indispensable. 
Diseases are often diagnosed by means of laboratory investigations either by 
chemical processes or by bacteriological examinations. It is thus, at the present 
time, that the diagnosis of phthisis (consumption) is decided and confirmed; thus 
also the nature of an epidemic is determined at its outset. 
The study of the applications of physical, chemical, and natural sciences will 
therefore follow the student during the whole of his professional course. We have 
the firm conviction that by this procedure we restore the scientific studies to their 
true place in medical instruction, 
Here follows a section of the report devoted to the consideration of 
the medical schools. As these are matters purely of administration 
they do not particularly concern us. The report concludes: 
Such are, in brief, the views which have influenced all those who for several years 
have studied these projects of reform. If they have varied in their opinions as to

some details, they have not differed as to the end to be attained, namely, to associate 
the experimental sciences with the medical studies properly so ealled, in such a 
manner as to maintain the prestige of our medical instruction. 
  CERTIFICATE OF PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL, AND NATURAL SCIENCES. 
The commission of which M. Darboux was the chairman was charged 
to examine the project of a decree relative to physical, chemical, and 
natural science studies as preliminary to the medical course. As 
explained by M. Darboux at the beginning of his report, this cominis- 
sion was obliged before entering upon its task to obtain the decisions 
of the commission whose report has just been considered. 
The president of this commission [says M. Darboux] having informed us that, 
saving only changes in details, they had unanimously adopted the project submitted 
to their examination, that they proposed to reorganize the medical studies conform- 
ably to the oft-repeated views of the faculties of medicine, and that they favored 
the organization, outside of these faculties, of preparatory courses in physical, chem- 
ical, and natural sciences, such as might give the future physicians the knowledge 
of these sciences both theoretical and practical, which they must possess in order 
to follow successfully the medical studies properly so called, our task was very pre- 
cisely defined. “It only remained for us to consider the best organization of this 
instruction, and where it should be placed in order to produce the best results. 
The detailed examination of this question led us to accept with some trifling mod- 
ifications the project which had been submitted to us. To insure your approval it 
will only be necessary to place before you a full résumé of the discussion which took 
place in the commission. 
We first considered what should be the nature of the new instruction. The 
answer to this question was indicated to us by the very terms in which it was pro- 
posed. In the project that had been reported to us, and which you had approved, 
the faculties of medicine retain complete control of the study of the applications 
of physical and natural sciences to the different branches of the art of healing, but 
they demand pupils already initiated into the elements of these sciences. The new 
instruction must, therefore, first of all, be general instruction and not instruction 
in applications. 
But as the physician is not a man of theory, but of practice, the new instruction 
must not only be theoretical but also practical and experimental. It is in labora- 
tories, in contact with a teacher, and not from books, that the pupil acquires a truly 
vital knowledge of experimental sciences. 
Where must this instruction be placed in order that it may have, to the highest 
degree, this indispensable double character, that it may be at once general and 
practical? Only two solutions were possible—the first was to place it in the iyeées 
and colleges, the other in the faculties of sciences. 
The first of these plans being out of the question, it would be useless 
to reproduce here the considerations advanced in its favor but for their 
general bearing. They afford an interesting view of the conditions 
under which secondary instruction is maintained in France, of the pur- 
poses by which it is animated, and of its relations to superior instrue- 
tion and to society in general. Moreover, these considerations were 
kept in mind by the advocates of the opposite policy, and, consequently, 
they are necessary to a full understanding of this side of the diseussion. 
Hence the report is reproduced without material omissions. 
 
-P-A-G-E-241
  EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 231 
One of our colleagues [says M. Darboux] gave the following reasons in favor of the 
first solution. Tho relegation of the new instruction to the lycées and colleges is 
necessary to maintain the equilibrium of the plan of secondary studies, so wisely 
organized in 1890. This plan comprehends an examination after the class of rhetoric 
which is common to all the students and the indjspensable sanction of literary 
studies; then after the class of philosophy three distinct examinations, correspond- 
ing to the needs and to the aptitudes of the scholars, i. e., ‘Lettres philosophie,” 
“Lettres mathematiques,” and a third series which it is proposed to organize, 
“Lettres sciences physiques et naturelles.” + 
The diploma inscribed ‘Lettres mathematiques” is intended especially for scholars 
who desire to enter the “schools” (superior technical), Physical science has only 
small representation in this course, and natural science has not been introduced at 
all. Hence it follows that, unless the baccalaureate of physical and natural sciences 
is organized the plan of studies will remain incomplete, and the programmes 
of secondary instruction will be inferior in this respect to those of the primary 
normal schools. This baccalaureate, not yet organized, ought not to be adapted 
solely to the needs of the future students of medicine; it should suffice also for all 
students who do not need a highly extended. mathematical culture, for sons of 
tradesmen and farmers, and for all young men who, by their aptitudes and taste, are 
inclined to the physical and natural sciences. The proposed measure (projet de 
decret) leaves these latter sciences, so far as regards secondary instruction, in a state 
of weakness and inferiority, which it is impossible to account for, considering their 
importance to society. In the lycée natural history is only taught in the philo- 
sophical class, and even there ina very elementary manner. Of what use, then, is it” 
to establish an examination for special professors (agrégation) of natural science? 
The project permits an encroachment of superior instruction upon secondary, which 
is to bv deplored, because the studies that it is proposed to organize in the faculties 
of science can only be secondary in view of the scientific attainments of the young 
men for who they are intended. Now all superior instruction should have a solid 
basis, and this secondary instruction must give. 
Secondary instruction has for its end the discipline of the mind required in every 
order of science. This discipline is attained in the class and by exercises, by the 
contact of the professor and the pupil. Within the faculties this contact can not 
be maintained to the same degree on account of the great number of pupils, who, 
with far better results could be distributed among the different establishments of 
secondary instruction. 
Why has the year of physical and natural sciences not produced better results in 
the faculties of medicine? Because the pupils were too numerous. The same will 
be the case in the faculties of science. On the other side, is it probable that parents 
will view the proposed measure with favor? Not only will it take the young men 
too early from the beneficent and necessary influence of the lycées, but it will 
iner the pecuniary sacrifices which they must undergo. From this point of view 
the project is not democratic. 
From the financial standpoint also the project is disadvantageous. In the second- 
ary course the projected instruction could be organized with less expense, A certain 
number of teachers do not reach the maximum working hours imposed upon them by 
the regulations. By completing their service and by assigning additional hours to 
others the expense would be very small. 
The persons necessary for this are quite ready; the teachers required are already 
prepared; they desire the new duties; they feel that they can perform them to their 
own honor-and also that the service now assigned to them does not accord with the 
qualifications demanded of them. 1s their ability questioned? The success which 
they achiove in preparing students for the “schools” (i. e., superior technical) will suf- 
fice for an answer. This project is therefore injurious to secondary instruction 
        s 1 For explanation see p.  
-P-A-G-E-242
  232 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  because it cuts off one of the most important branches of this course, and also, 
because it deprives the course of a powerful influence against the competition to 
which it is subject. Many pupils in private institutions look to the lycées for scien- 
tific education. To organize therein instruction in physical sciences would be to 
furnish to our establishments a new means of strengthening public instruction (un 
nouveau moyen de propagande universitaire), Finally the project makes the first 
breach in secondary instruction. Is it not to be feared that later on others will be 
made? Will not the transfer of the special mathematical and philosophical classes 
into the faculties follow? Thus are summarized, as precisely and completely as 
possible, the considerations presented in favor of the first solution. 
Before presenting the reasons for the other solution, we will submit certain obser- 
vations and statements in opposition to the above. First, there is no question at all 
about cutting down secondary instruction. To do this, would be to take away 
something from it. But what is taken away? Nothing. Where are the pupils in 
question? In superior instruction. It is proposed only to transfer them from the 
faculty of medicine to the faculty of sciences, Already students of superior instruc- 
tion, they will still remain students of superior instruction. 
It is therefore useless to speak of a breach in secondary instruction, Hence, also, 
the apprehensions expressed as to the classes of philosophy and special mathematics 
is chimerical. Moreover, on this subject, the administration has given the most 
explicit and most emphatic assurances. Not only has it never thought of transferring 
the classes of philosophy and special mathematics from the lycées into the faculties, 
but it has declared that such a project would be veritable folly, more dangerous to 
the interests of superior instruction than to those of secondary instruction itself. 
Neither is there any question of passing the future students of medicine from the 
lycées into superior instruction at an earlier age than at present. This age will be 
the same to-morrow as it was yesterday. 
But their secondary studies once terminated, philosophy once finished, once made 
bachelors, the young men will be admitted to the faculties. The only difference is 
this, for the first year, a difference in respect to place, i. e., the faculty of sciences 
instead of the faculty of medicine; this is not a difference in respect to age. Nor is 
there any ground for a question about increasing the expenses of families. Indeed 
your commission on the medical faculties has arranged this in the most satisfactory 
way—the duration of the studies will not be prolonged. I can not do better here 
than to refer to what has already been presented to you.! 
Finally, it is useless to discuss the competency of the professors of secondary 
instruction. There is no reasou nor ground for this. Almost all the professors of 
the faculties have been professors of the lycées; they remember this and feel honored 
by it. In their eyes public education is a unit, and they can admit no other rivalry 
among the different orders of education than that of devotion to the public welfare. 
These questions disposed of, we may consider the arguments which have prevailed 
  in the commission. 
The real matter, and the only matter to be considered, is to organize the new 
instruction under the conditions most favorable to its success, to the interest of the 
studies, and to the good of the country. In order to settle this it is not necessary to 
proceed with abstract definitions. Where does secondary instruction commence? 
Where does it finish? Where does superior instruction commence? Different theo- 
retical answers can be given to these questions. 
In a general way, as one of our colleagues remarked, that which characterizes 
superior instruction is not the subjects taught, but the methods. Very elementary 
matters may legitimately be the subjects of superior instruction if they are taught 
by those methods which enable the student to master them for himself. Now, such 
should be the character of instruction in the faculties of medicine. They demand 
students who combine with theoretical knowledge a certain practice in experiments 
  
1 Seep. 229.  
-P-A-G-E-243
  EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 233 
and manipulations, that is to say, in those processes which alone enable one to explain 
phenomena, to truly understand them. In these matters, moreover, we must be 
guided not by theoretical ideas alone, but, above all, by facts. Practical matters are 
judged by their results; the results can only be known through facts. Let us then 
consider in the light of facts from which side, lycée or faculty of sciences, the best 
results may be expected. 
It might be assumed that the new organization could be limited to certain lycées; 
for instance, to one for each académy—to that one nearest the faculty of sciences or 
the faculty or school of medicine. This solution would bé impracticable. There 
are about 1,200 students of the first year in the faculties of medicine; of this num- 
ber at least seven or eight hundred come from the lycées or colleges of the State. 
To distribute them as proposed, would be to have in each one of the selected lycées— 
save Paris, where there must be more—groups of sixty, eighty, or even a hundred _ 
students. Withoutinquiring if this would be good for the general discipline of these 
lycées, we need only ask where are the laboratories for so great a number of students? 
They do not exist, and they can not be constructed. Possibly, as has been sug- 
gested, those of the faculty of science might be used, but that would, in reality, 
place the new instruction within the faculty of sciences, while the pupils whose 
parents reside in other cities would live in the lycées. 
But it would not be possible to limit the new instruction to a few lycées. Unfor- - 
tunately, it must be introduced everywhere, in the colleges as well as in the lycées. 
Need we cite the example of the special mathematical classes, in all 47, of the special 
classes for St. Cyr, numbering 57.1. These numbers prove that the administration is 
often forced to go beyond what is required. 
In respect to the new course, there wouid be still greater pressure. If it is recog- 
nized as an integral part of secondary instruction, the demands of the families are 
justitied in advance. Now these demands would be made everywhere, as the future 
students of medicine are distributed everywhere, in the colleges as well as in the 
lyeées. Moreover, to say nothing of local rivalries and the inevitable effects of influ- 
ence, there is also the rivalry of the private establishments. Wherever the State 
should refuse to have the studies preparatory to the medical course in its lycées and 
colleges, private institutions would organize them and the State would be forced to 
do the same. We have seen what this new instruction ought to be. Let us see what 
it would be under these conditions. 
In order to be thorough, it ought to be, as we have said, at once theoretical, prac- 
tical, and experimental. Now, in the lycées there is no room for the laboratories, 
The expenses of creating them would be considerable, and out of all proportion to 
the results. The material is equally lacking. There exists indeed in every lycée a 
physical cabinet, but the instruments to be put into the hands of the students for 
the manipulations in physics, chemistry, and natural history are wanting. They 
must be furnished. In estimating the expenses at 60,000 francs ($12,000) for each 
lycée (a low estimate and probably insufficient), this would require at the outset, 
and without reference to sites, an expenditure of more than six millions. The col- 
leges, it will be seen, are not considered here. 
The number of professors in the lycées is insufficient. To raise the number of 
lessons to be given each professor to the highest required in his position, and in 
addition to charge him with supplementary lessons, would be a sorry expedient, for, 
to quote the words of the commission, this would be to provide for the new instruc- 
tion by shreds (rognures); therefore it would be necessary to employ extra pro- 
fessors in almost all lycées, to say nothing of the colleges. Together with these 
professors, an equal number of superintendents of practical work would be required. 
At present there are none in the lycées. Two at least would be needed in every 
establishment—one for physics and chemistry, one for natural history. This 
would make more than 200 new positions still, not including the colleges. * * * 
    
1 Reference is here made to special classes in the lycées.  
-P-A-G-E-244
  234 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Besides this, assistants would be required; these must necessarily be specialists, 
and at least 200 in number for the lycées only. 
Finally, there would be expenses for material for practical work in every establish- 
estiment. This expenditure would be considerable. According to the most careful 
estimates laid before the commission, the annual expenditure, not including the cost 
of the first establishment, would amount to no less than 1,500,000 franes for the lycées 
alone. Thus, after subtracting the expenditure for tuition, every student would cost 
the State more than 20,000 franes ($4,000) per year. 
In view of these estimates, which have not been exaggerated, if the studies are to 
be properly provided for, the plan here considered is not practicable. * * * 
Let us now examine the other solution, namely, that of placing the new instruc- 
tion into the faculty of sciences. You know what profound transformations have 
been accomplished in these establishments within twenty years. Everywhere the 
buildings have been reconstructed and enlarged; they have been supplied with large 
laboratories for the experimental sciences. If in some places these are still too 
small, the remedy is easy. It is not the same with a faculty as with the lycées, 
which can only be enlarged by the acquisition of territory and the construction of 
adjacent buildings. 
A barrack on a site not far distant is sufficient. Certainly, we professors of the 
faculties of Paris will never forget the services rendered to superior instruction by 
the barracks and halls of Gerson. As to the material, it exists everywhere complete 
and admirable. The corps of teachers? Without doubt, it will be necessary to 
increase it. But this increase will be small compared with that which we examined 
before (i. ¢., with respect to lycées). The corps of laboratory chiefs and assistants? 
The faculties have these, both able and experienced. For fifteen years they have 
been developing on this side. If it be necessary to increase the force, the expense 
will be small compared with that which would be necessary in the lycées and col- 
leges. Finally, the faculties have ample resources to meet the annual expenditure 
for laboratories and practical work. 
According to the estimates laid before the commission, the increase of expenditure 
will not surpass the increase in receipts. 
Considered from the intellectual standpoint, the faculties of science are thoroughly 
competent, even better prepared for insuring the discipline of the mind in any par- 
ticular order of sciences than was deemed necessary by one of our colleagues, who 
proposed to place the new course in the lycées. Such a discipline results less from 
the effect of the lesson given by the teacher than from his contact with the student, 
and the atmosphere in which the student lives. 
Now those professors of the faculty who have devoted themselves to the experi- 
mental sciences live in their laboratories with their assistants in constant communi- 
cation with their pupils. In these laboratories the students are, as it were, enveloped 
in science; they handle the apparatus; they sce it in action; everything speaks of 
their specialty, the material as well as the teachers. This is the only place indeed 
where they can be filled with the spirit of science and thoroughly comprehend it. 
Moreover, we have something more ard better than hopes and promises. The 
administration was of the opinion that, in a matter like this, experience was desir- 
able. With the assent of the permanent section of the superior council of education 
an experiment has been made at Toulouse. Now for three years in that city students 
of medicine have received during their first year instruction in physical, chemical, 
and natural sciences in the faculty of science. The experiment has succeeded; the 
results are entirely satisfactory. The deans of the faculty of medicine and of the 
faculty of sciences charged one colleague, who belongs to the faculties of Toulouse, 
to inform us as to theresults. We cite the facts in support of the project. It remains 
to submit the considerations as to another matter with which tho commission was 
especially charged. The course to be created is a general one. Although intended 
for the future physicians, it may also serve others. Besides the young men who enter
-P-A-G-E-245
  EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 235 
into the special schools, as the Central School and the Agronomic Institute, a great 
number of those destined for industrial or agricultural careers will need correspond- 
ing practical instruction. 
Some faculties of science—Lyons and Nancy for instance—have voluntarily tried 
to meet this requirement. Experience has shown that those students to whom these 
faculties have given instruction, practical indeed, but general in its nature, have 
been very successful in industry. It has seemed to us that, in this respect, the new 
instruction might produce excellent results. While giving indispensable scientific 
preparation to the future physicians it will also give equal preparation to others, and 
thus become, in certain centers, the basis of technical instruction, which will be 
advantageous for our national industries. Thus the particular conditions for acquir- 
ing the degree of doctor of medicine being determined by a special decree, we 
recommend that the proposed courses be open to the bachelors of all orders. We go 
further, in the true spirit of sound democracy, and, supported by the results already 
obtained at Lyons and Nancy, we recommend also that this course be opened to 
select pupils from the primary schools who pass the required tests. 
We shall be glad to see this union established between superior and primary 
instruction, as it will certainly be useful to both of them. The faculties, having 
been freely consulted in this matter, according to the liberal policy of the Govern- 
ment, have agreed to accept the new responsibility. They have already a well- 
defined purpose, i. e., that of preparing candidates for the degree of licencié, for the 
examinations for special professorship (agrégations), for the doctorate, and for special 
research. 
They will maintain this service and will discharge it as heretofore. They have 
already a large attendance upon these courses, not less than 1,900 students. In 
enlarging their province, in placing beside their highest instruction courses more 
elementary and experimental work of a modest character, but so useful that the 
most experienced professors will willingly bear part in them, the faculties are con- 
scious that they will fill up a gap in our educational provision and at the same time 
mect a pressing demand of the time. 
It is impossible to overestimate the ever increasing part which pure science must 
bear in the activities and industries of our society. The remarkable development 
of industrial chemistry in a neighboring country, of electrical industry in all coun- 
tries, has been brought about by men, whether chiefs or subordinates, who have 
followed university courses or who haye come from institutions directed by univer- 
sity professors. In exchange for all that the country has done for them, our facul- 
ties desire to render an equivalent service. This they will do by imparting to the 
future physicians the indispensable knowledge of the sciences called accessory, but 
which we will rather call fundamental, by bringing artisans and agriculturists 
into the current of scientific method, and also, they hope, in some instances at 
least, by developing eminent savants, whose abilities would otherwise remain dor- 
mant and useless. 
In view of these considerations, your commission recommend to you, almost unani- 
mously, and saving only some changes of detail, the adoption of the project “laid 
before you.” 
Asa result of the reports cited, and in accordance with the advice of 
the superior council of public instruction, the President of the Republie 
issued the two following decrees, dated both July 31, 1893: 
DECREE REGULATING THE COURSE OF STUDY AND THE EXAMINATIONS REQUIRED

DECREE RELATIVE TO SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC STUDIES REQUIRED FOR ADMISSION TO 
THE MEDICAL COURSE. 
ARTICLE 1. There is instituted in the faculties of sciences a preparatory course of 
physical, chemical, and natural sciences. 
Art. 2. To this instruction are admitted young men provided with a diploma of 
bachelor, and, after examination by the faculty, young men of at least seventeen

CHAPTER VI. 
EDUCATION IN ONTARIO, NEW ZEALAND, AND INDIA. 
I.—SysteM oF EDUCATION IN ONTARIO. 
(Salient features of the system as presented by the deputy minister of education, 
y. John Millar, B. A. Current operations as set forth in an address by the min- 
ister, Hon. George W. Ross.)      
The Dominion of Canada comprises the seven Provinces—Quebec, 
Ontario, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Mani- 
toba, and British Golumbia—each of which has its separate system of 
public instruction. The system of Ontario possesses peculiar interest 
for us on account both of the features in which it resembles and those 
in which it differs from the systems in our own States. A very com- 
plete exposition of the Ontario system, prepared by the deputy minister 
of education, Mr. John Millar, has recently been published by the 
Ontario education department. The salient features of the system, 
as set forth in this monograph, are as follows: 
Origin.—The system of education in Ontario may be said to combine 
the best features of the systems of several countries. To the Old World 
it is indebted for a large measure of its stability, uniformity, and cen- 
tralization; to the older settled parts of the New World for its popular 
nature, its flexibility, and its democratic principles, which have given, 
wherever desirable, local control and individual responsibility. From 
the State of New York we have borrowed the machinery of our schools; 
from Massachusetts the principle of local taxation; from Ireland our 
first series of text books; from Scotland the cooperation of parents 
with the teacher in upholding his authority; from Germany the system 
of normal schools and the kindergarten, and from the United States 
generally the nondenominational character of elementary, secondary, 
and university education. 
Ontario may claim to have some features of her system that are 
largely her own. Among them may be mentioned a division of state 
and municipal authority on a judicious basis; clear lines separating the 
function of the university from that of the high schools, and the fune- 
tion of the high schools from that of the publie or elementary schools; 
a uniform course of study; all high and public schools in the hands of 
professionally tramed teachers; no person eligible to the position of 
239

  240 z EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
inspector who does not hold the highest grade of a teacher’s certificate, 
and who has not had years of experience as a teacher; inspectors 
removable if inefficient, but not subject to removal by popular vote; 
the examinations of the teachers under provincial instead of local con- 
trol; the acceptance of a common matriculation examination for admis- 
sion to the universities and to the learned profession; a uniform series 
of text-books for the whole Province; the almost entire absence of 
party politics in the manner in which school boards, inspectors, and 
teachers discharge their duties; the system national instead of secta- 
rian, but affording under constitutional guarantees and limitations 
protection to Roman Catholic and Protestant separate schools and 
denominational universities. 
Unity.—The three main features of elementary, secondary, and higher 
education are clearly defined in the system adopted in Ontario. It is 
held that each of these has its own proper field and that no one of 
them should trench upon the grounds of another. It is also intended 
that there should be, as far as possible, no overlapping of the courses 
of study. The system includes the kindergarten, public and separate 
schools, high schools and the collegiate institutes, and the university. 
These may be regarded as an organic whole. The child enters the 
kindergarten at perhaps 4 years of age, and the public school at 6, and 
is prepared, about the age of 13, to be admitted to a high school. Four 
or five years at the high school or collegiate institute enables him to 
matriculate in the university, where he attends four years and gains his 
B, A. degree. This course, if taken in full, gives him superior educa- 
tional advantages for taking up the study of his chosen profession or 
entering upon the calling in life to which his mind is directed. 
As only a small percentage of the youth of any country can reach the 
highest rung of the educational ladder, the curriculum is so arranged 
as to afford, as far as possible, no misdirected steps to those who do not 
take the full course. As the great body of the people must be the 
“pbreadwinners,” and from necessity never reach the high school, the 
course of study for the elementary schools is limited to a few subjects 
of the most practical character, the three “R’s” receiving special promi- 
nence. Moreover the curriculum of the high schools in the lower terms 
puts stress upon English, arithmetic, geography, history, elementary 
science, bookkeeping, drawing, reading, and physical education. 
The principles of our system of national education favor no ckass or 
sect. ‘The rich and the poor meet together.” Private schools have 
been successful only in rare instances. The high school has been called 
the “poor man’s college,” on account of the general desire in the com- 
munity to exact low fees from students, and in many instances to charge 
no fees. The highest distinctions in the university are most frequently 
gained by the sons—and daughters, too—of workingmen. 
No part of the system can do without the others. To the high 
schools the public schools are indebted for their efficient army of well-
-P-A-G-E-251
  EDUCATION IN ONTARIO. 241 
educated teachers. In like manner the university furnishes in the 
persons of its graduates the well-trained principals and assistants of 
our high schools and collegiate institutes. The secondary schools, in 
turn, supply the university with hundreds of well-prepared matricu- 
lants. To improve the university is to give an impetus to the high 
schools, and to render the latter more efficient tells likewise upon the 
character of elementary education. If one member of the body suffers, 
all the other members of the body suffer with it. It is thus that 
all departments of the system form a harmonious unity, and it is thus 
the functions of each have come to be fully recognized and clearly 
understood. 
Relations to municipalities.—The municipal system of Ontario affords 
a full measure of local self-government. The Province is for the most 
part divided into counties, which are subdivided into minor muni- 
cipalities, consisting of townships, incorporated villages, towns, and 
cities. These corporations are given certain powers, and have certain 
responsibilities with respect to education. Through their municipal 
councils, counties are under obligation to make grants of money to 
high schools, and both counties and townships must contribute certain 
sums in aid of public schools. Each township is divided into school 
sections, and each of these sections is provided with a public school. 
There is a board of trustees for each school section, incorporated vil- 
lage, town, and city. Much the greater part of what is expended for 
public schools is provided by the school section, village, town, or city. 
The ratepayers (men and women) elect the trustees who, within the 
provisions of the provincial statutes or regulations of the education 
department, appoint the teachers and determine the amounts to be 
expended for buildings, equipments, and salaries. It thus follows that 
the system of education in Ontario is essentially democratic, and in 
those matters which affect the sentiments or touch the pockets of the 
people, each locality has almost entire control. It is not, however, con- 
sidered wise to decentralize as regards the granting of certificates to 
teachers and inspectors, the authorizing of text-books, the fixing of 
courses of study, and the prescribing of the duties of trustees, inspect- 
ors, and teachers. These are questions which, though still under the 
control of the people, are regulated by a responsible government. 
Relations to churches.—There is no established church in Ontario, or 
connection between church and state. The constitution gives the Proy- 
ince control of its educational affairs, and the great majority of the 
people believe that schools and colleges should be nondenominational. 
No religious body has any voice in the management of the high and 
public schools or the university. These institutions are, however, far 
from being “Godless” or irreligious. Though not religious, they are 
institutions of a Christian people. The doctrines of no church are 
taught, but the principles of Christianity form an essential feature of 
the daily exercises. The teachers are, with very rare exceptions, men

  242 | EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
and women of high moral character. The cooperation of the elergy of 
all denominations in educational gatherings is quite common, and rec- 
ognition of religion is fully shown in the following regulations which 
have been prescribed by the education department: 
(1) Every public and high school shall be opened with the Lord’s Prayer and 
closed with the reading of the Scriptures and the Lord’s Prayer, or the prayer 
authorized by the department of education. - 
(2) The Scriptures shall be read daily and systematically without comment or 
explanation, and the portions used may be taken from the book of selections adopted 
by the department for that purpose, or from the Bible, as the trustees, by resolution 
inay direct. 
(3) Trustees may also order the reading of the Bible or the autherized Scripture 
selections by both pupils and teachers at the opening and ciosing of the school, and 
the repeating of the Ten Commandments at least once a week. 
(4) No pupil shall be required to take part in any religious exercise objected to by 
his parents or guardians, and in order to the observance of this regulation, the 
teacher, before commencing a religious exercise, is to allow a short interval to elapse, 
during which the children of Roman Catholics and of others who have signified their 
objection, may retire. 
(5) If in virtue of the right to be absent from the religious exercises any pupil 
does not enter the schoolroom till fifteen minutes after the proper time for the open- 
ing the school in the forenoon, such absence shall not be treated as an offense against 
the rulés of the school. ¥ 
(6) When a teacher claims to have conscientious scruples in regard to opening or 
closing the school as herein prescribed, he shali notify the trustees to that effect in 
writing, and it shall be the duty of the trustees to make such provision in the 
premises as they may deem expedient. 
(7) The clergy of any denomination, or their authorized representatives, shall have 
the right to give religious instruction to the pupils of their own church, in each school- 
house, at least once a week, after the hour of closing the school in the afternoon, and 
if the clergy of more than one denomination apply to give religious instruction in 
the same schoolhouse, the board of trustees shall decide on what day of the week the 
schoolhouse shall be at the disposal of the clergyman of each denomination at the 
time above stated. But it shall be lawful for the board of trustees and clergymen 
of any denomination to agree upon any hour of the day at which a clergyman, or his 
authorized representative, may give religious instruction to the pupils of his own 
church, provided it be not during the regular hours of the school. Emblems of a 
denominational character shall not be exhibited in a public school during regular 
school hours. 
The imperial statute, called the British North America act, which 
united the Provinces forming the Dominion of Canada, guaranteed cer- 
tain educational privileges to the Roman Catholic citizens of Ontario. 
The separate schools act, as it is termed, enables Protestants, as well 
as Roman Catholics, to establish, under certain conditions, schools for 
themselves. In these schools, in addition to the ordinary course of 
study for public schools, religious exercises are taken up under the 
direction of the trustees. The education department has not the same 
authority under the statute over Roman Catholic separate schools as it 
has over the public schools, yet in the main features—such as the 
qualification of teachers, excepting those in religious orders, the selec- 
tion of text-books, except those required for religidus exercises—the 
 
-P-A-G-E-253
  EDUCATION IN ONTARIO. 243 
authority of the department may be said to be the same. There is no 
provision in the constitution allowing the establishment of separate 
high schools, and any private or denominational institutions of this 
kind which have been established receive no legislative aid, nor are 
their supporters exempted from taxation for the national schools. 
The Roman Catholics have shown as little disposition as the Protes- 
tants to establish denominational schools for secondary education, and 
the verdict of all classes appears to be that religious convictions are 
not interfered with, and that Christian principles are strengthened by 
attendance at the high schools and collegiate institutes. A few church 
schools have been opened for boys and several: ladies’ colleges have 
been established by different denominations. The course of study in 
these institutions is, in many respects, similar to that in the high 
schools, and the students frequently write at the same university and 
departmental examinations. 
The Provincial University is also nondenomitational. All the 
churches are well represented among its alumni. The arts course has 
been taken up by Episcopalian, Presbyterian, Methodist, Baptist, aind 
Roman Catholic candidates for the ministry before attending the theo- 
logical colleges of their respective denominations. No religious tests 
are required of the professors, who, in fact, represent different denomi- 
nations, and, in many instances, have identified themselves with the 
work of the different churches. An important adjunct to the uni- 
versity is a flourishing Young Men’s Christian Association, which has 
been of much service as a religious and moral bond of union among the 
students. 
The wishes of those who prefer attendance at a denominational uni- 
versity are well met by the several institutions of the kind that have 
been established, viz: Ottawa University (Roman Catholic), Queen’s 
University (Presbyterian), Trinity (Episcopalian), the Western Uni- 
versity (Episcopalian), Victoria University (Methodist), now federated 
with Toronto, and McMaster University (Baptist). These are sus- 
tained by private endowments or grants made by religious bodies. No 
financial assistance is given them by the State. The course of study is, 
as a rule, the same as in the Provincial University and University 
College, except that some options of a denominational character are 
allowed, They have all accepted a uniform matriculation examination 
held by the education department and Toronto University. No relig- 
ious tests are required, and the degrees have the same legal value as 
those given by the Provincial University. 
Relations to parents—Compulsory education.—It is held to be the duty 
of the State to provide free elementary schools... To allow children to 
grow up in ignorance is detrimental to the interests of the community. 
All persons are taxed to support education, because its general diffu- 
sion is for the public good. It is held that compulsory education is a 
necessary corollary of free education. If the State gives the boon of 
 
-P-A-G-E-254
    244 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
free schools to all, it has a right to see that the expected advantages 
are realized. On this principle the truancy and compulsory education 
act of 1891 was passed. This statute combines the best features of the 
Jaws of Great Britain on the subject, as well as those of the principal 
States of the American Union. By this act all children between the 
ages of 8 and 14 are obliged to attend school for the full term during 
which the school is open, and parents or guardians who fail to send 
their children are subject to penalties. The rights of conscience are 
sufficiently guarded. Penalties are not inflicted if the child is under 
efficient instruction at home, or unable to attend through sickness or 
other unavoidable cause, or is excused by a justice of the peace or by 
the principal of the school, or if he has passed the high school entrance 
examination. 
Any person employing a child under 14 years of age, during school 
hours, is liable to a penalty of $20. When the services of a child are 
deemed urgent, an absence from school for six weeks of the term may 
be granted. Provision is made for sending a child who is vicious and 
immoral to an industrial school. To nip truancy in the bud is regarded 
as the most effective means of preventing a recourse to the penalties of 
the act. Truant officers must be appointed for every city; town, and 
incorporated village, and may be appointed for every school section. 
These officers are vested with police powers, and have authority to 
enter factories, workshops, stores, and other places where children may 
be employed, and ascertain whether there is any violation of the act. 
Regulations may be made by the local authorities for the better 
enforcement of the statute. The truant officers must report annually 
to the education department according to prescribed forms. 
Separation from municipal and party politics.—The system of educa- 
tion in Ontario is remarkably free from polities. * * * School 
trustees are not selected from our municipal councils, and in the case of 
high school boards and boards of education the members can not hold 
at the same time positions in the municipal council of the municipality 
or county in which the high school is situated. The candidates for 
political honors or the “ wire-pullers” of a political party have scarcely 
any chance to advance their interests by bringing party politics into 
the domain of school management. Inspectors are not selected by pop- 
ular vote. No person can be appointed as inspector who has not a cer- 
tificate showing that he has attained to the highest rank as a public 
school teacher. * * * 
Boards of education have nothing to do with fixing the standards of 
examinations or awarding certificates. The graduates of the high 
- school, which is controlled by the trustees, must attend a training 
school before being eligible for positions in the gift of the board. In 
the case of public schools the inspector, or in the case of high schools 
the priucipal, is properly consulted regarding appointments. It is safe 
to say that rarely does an inspector or high school principal make his 
 
-P-A-G-E-255
  
EDUCATION IN ONTARIO. 245 
recommendations through political motives, or make himself obnoxious 
to a section of the community by taking a part in the “party caucus” 
or political campaign. Appointments are almost invariably made on 
the ground of fitness, and even though personal motives and preferences 
may influence trustees, the fact that a candidate for a position takes an 
active interest in politics would prove fatal to his success even among 
his political friends. It is not intended to convey the impression that 
teachers or inspectors are debarred from any rights as citizens in the 
study of political questions, or the expression of their political views. 
It is only meant that their positions render it injudicious for them to 
alienate a part of the public by actively indulging in the strife of party 
warfare, and that inspectors or teachers who do so find their useful- 
ness gone. 
Education department.—By an act of the legislative assembly of the 
Province the educational department is intrusted with the administra- 
tion of the school law. The department consists of the members of 
the executive government, and its head, as already stated, is the min- 
ister of education. Subject to the provisions of any statute in that 
behalf, and the regulations of the department, there may be established. 
the following schools: (1) Kindergartens, (2) public schools, (3) night 
schools, (4) high schools and collegiate institutes, (5) art schools, (6) 
county model schools, (7) normal schools, (8) schools of pedagogy, (9) 
teachers’ institutes, (10) mechanics’ institutes, (11) industrial schools. 
It is the duty of the minister to direct all the educational forces in 
the country; first, from his place as a member of the legislative assem- 
bly, and secondly, through the officers of his department. From the 
discussions of educational questions in the provincial parliament, his 
position as a member gives him the best facilities for recognizing the 
working of the school law and ascertaining the trend of public opinion. 
As the head of his department, his constant official intercourse with 
trustees, inspectors, and teachers gives him the greatest opportunity for 
prescribing from time to time whatever amendments to the regulations 
may be considered wise in the interest of high and publie schools. 
From the wide sweep of the legislation which he is expected to direct, 
and from his position as a member of the government responsible to 
the people’s representatives, he is able to advance such legislation as 
will guard the unity of the system and preserve its symmetry, as well 
as prevent any needless innovation from pseudo-reformers or visionary 
meddlers. Extensive powers are given to the education department, 
but every regulation or order in council made under the statute giving 
it an existence, or under the public, separate, or high schools act must 
be laid before the legislative assembly. It has power, subject to the 
provisions of any statute in that behalf, to make regulations— 
(1) For the classification, organization, government, and examination of all schools 
and institutes in the preceding section mentioned, and for the equipment of school- 
houses and the arrangement of school premises;  
-P-A-G-E-256
  246 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
(2) For the authorization of text-books for the use of pupils attending such 
schools or institutes and for the selection of books of reference for the use of 
teachers and pupils, and school libraries; 
(8) For determining the qualifications and duties of inspectors, examiners, and 
teachers of such schools and institutes, and for the appointment from time to time 
of such examiners as may be requisite for that purpose; 
(4) For the payment of the pensions of superannuated inspectors and teachers, 
and the proper distribution of all moneys set apart by the legislative assembly for 
school purposes; $ 
(5) For extending, on the petition of a board of school trustees, and on such 
evidence as to efficiency as may be deemed necessary, any third-class certificate 
issued under the authority of the public schools act; 
(6) For the study of agriculture and for scientific instruction as to the nature of 
alcoholic stimulants and narcotics with special reference to their effect upon the 
human system. 
The education department has power also— 
(1) To appoint inspectors of high schools, separate schools, and county model 
schools, masters of normal and model schools, and directors of teachers’ institutes; 
(2) To affiliate with the schools of pedagogy such high schools or collegiate insti- 
tutes as may be necessary for practical instruction in the art of teaching; 
(8) To determine the fees to be paid by candidates at departmental examinations; 
(4) To accept in such subjects as may be deemed expedient the examination of 
any university in the British Dominions in lieu of the departmental examinations ; 
(5) To prescribe such forms for school registers and departmental reports as may 
be deemed expedient; 
(6) To accept, on passing the annual departmental examination, the professional 
or training certificate of any normal school or other training institution in the 
British Dominions. 
The minister of education makes an annual report to the lieutenant- 
governor upon the schools and other institutions under the control of 
his department with such statements and suggestions for promoting 
education generally as he may deem useful and expedient. He has 
power to decide upon all disputes and complaints laid before him, the 
settlement of which is not otherwise provided by law, and upon all 
appeals made to him from the decisions of any inspector or other school 
officer. 
PRESENT STATUS OF THE SYSTEM. 
The following review of the operations of the system was presented 
before the legislature by the minister of education, Hon. George W. 
Ross, in submitting the estimates for 1894. The value of this survey 
is enhanced by comparative statistics and by the discussions of topics 
of vital interest in all systems: 
The estimates for educational purposes may be conveniently grouped under four 
heads: (1) Grants to elementary schools; (2) grants to secondary schools; (3) grants 
for the training of teachers; (4) grants for technical education. 
The grants for elementary education are divided principally among three classes of 
schools—public schools, separate schools, and poor schools. There is, in addition, a 
small grant for kindergartens and night schools, and for pupils in the highest form 
of public and separate schools who pass the leaving examination. ;
-P-A-G-E-257
EDUCATION IN ONTARIO. 247 
  By statute the amount appropriated for public and separate schools is divided on 
the basis of average attendance in each respectively. The amount paid to public 
schools in 1893 was $222,844.45, and the amount to separate schools $18,491.60. The 
Roman Catholic separate schools received over one-thirteenth of the money voted 
by the legislative assembly, while the Roman Catholic population of the Province 
is about one-sixth. 
Although the amount given for elementary education is not as large as one would 
desire, still, having regard to the increase of the population, the legislature can not 
be said to be remiss in its duty. In 1871 the amount paid by the Government for 
elementary education was $178,975. This sum steadily increased, until in 1893 it 
amounted to $291,325, or an increase of 62 per cent in the last twenty years, while 
the pupils enrolled have increased only 7 per cent. 
There has also been a very substantial increase in the aid given to poor schools. 
Beginning with $5,990 in 1871, this grant has increased until it now reaches $45,000. 
From the reports of the inspectors I am led to believe that no money voted by the 
legislature is more gratefully received or more economically expended. In spite of 
all we have done for tho settlers in the northern districts in the way of railways and 
colonization roads, they still suffer many of the inconveniences incident to pioneer 
life. By means of the grants given by the Government the burdens of taxation for 
education have been greatly lightened, and schools are now established as far west 
as the Rainy River district under teachers of recognized ability, and this year we 
hope to be successful in establishing a public school on the shores of James Bay. 
These schools were attended last year by over 10,000 children, and, although the 
attendance was not as regular as in the settled districts, Iam satisfied from the 
reports of the inspectors that the pupils are steadily advancing in their studies. 
The attendance at night schools was till two years ago regarded as attendance 
at the public school, and consequently they shared in the grant to public¢ schools on 
the basis of average attendance. 
Three years ago the legislature, feeling the importance of affording greater encour- 
agement to such schools, appropriated asmall grant which went directly to the 
board of trustees for the purpose of defraying necessary expenses. The number of 
night schools established and receiving aid in 1892 was 32, and the number of pupils 
in attendance was 2,293. It is proposed to continue the grant, as without it many 
young menand women, belonging especially to the working classes, would be placed 
at a disadvantage as compared with those who are able to attend school during the 
day. 
KINDERGARTENS. 
Just before I took charge of the education department my predecessor had taken 
steps for the introduction of the kindergarten system of instruction into the schools 
of Toronto. Such schools were sanctioned by the public schools act under the name 
of “Infant schools.” As this term had no distinctive meaning in this Province, the 
school act of 1885 was amended to provide expressly for the establishment of kinder- 
gartens. So far as I know the Province of Ontario was the first Province or State 
on the continent to recognize as part of its school system the philosophical teach- 
ings of Froebel and Pestalozzi. Even in Germany the kindergarten system has 
received no State recognition, such schools, though largely attended, being private 
undertakings. The growth of the kindergarten system is remarkable. In 1882 the 
first kindergarten was opened in the city of Toronto; now, in 1893, we have 85 kin- 
dergartens, with 200 teachers, attended by 8,056 pupils. Kindergartens have been 
established in nearly every city in the Province and in several of the larger towns, 
and I understand they meet with the cordial approval of the ratepayers, are found 
to be very stimulating to the teachers, and have greatly developed kindly methuds 
of discipline in the management of our schools.  
-P-A-G-E-258
  248 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  SCHOOL ATTENDANCE, 
The percentage of pupils enrolled in proportion to the population of the country 
furnishes gratifying evidence of the interest taken by all classes in the education of 
their children. In this respect Ontario leads all the Provinces of the Dominion and 
nearly every State of the Union. Iowa is the only State that surpasses Ontario in 
its zeal for elementary education. Let me give a few comparisons: 
Out of her whole population Ontario sends to her elementary schools 24.95 per 
cent; Maine, 21.13; Illinois, 20.34; Michigan, 20.39; New York, 17.38; Ohio, 21.71; 
Massachusetts, 16.95; Iowa, 25.80. 
An important feature in connection with the enrollment is the relative length of the 
school year in Ontario and the United States. In Maine the average length of the 
school year is less than 6 months; in Connecticut, 10 months; in Illinois, 74+ 
months; In Iowa, 7 months; in Massachusetts, 8 months; in New York, 9 months. 
The average for the whole United States was only 134 days, or less than 7 months, 
against 208 days, i. e., a trifle over 10 months, in Ontario. ‘lhe average number of 
days which a pupil in the United States attends a public school is 87} days in the 
year; in Ontario the average number of days is 1121, or a trifle over 54 months. 
In rural districts the average is largely reduced by the irregularity of pupils in the 
newer districts, and even in the most favored portions of Ontario the severity of the 
winter seriously affects school attendance. In cities and towns the average in some 
cases reaches as high as 75 per cent of the aggregate, or an average of 150 days in 
the year for each pupil. 
There are two reflections germane to the subject of school attendance worthy of 
notice: First, with the irregularity of attendance there is a great loss of teaching 
force, and a necessarily imperfect development of the child’s education. We paid 
last year $2,752,629 for the salaries of the teachers employed in the education of half 
a million of children. Less than half of the number of pupils attended school the 
whole year, consequently one-half of the sum expended on teachers’ salaries must have 
produced very unsatisfactory results, and one-half the children at school, no matter 
how zealous the Government or the education department may be, must have received 
but a very imperfect education. The second reflection is that.a child who devotes 
himself to study on an average of 120 days in the year, that is, less than one-third 
of the whole time, is not in very great danger of suffering either mental or physical 
disability from the alleged overpressure of our school system, Even admitting that 
examinations are exacting and home lessons sometimes unreasonable, one .day’s 
study, six hours at school, and two days off, for that is what it amounts to, is not 
very taxing. 
The Germans are a vigorous people, possessed of great vitality and energy, yet the 
schools of Germany show an average attendance of 78 per cent, with much longer 
hours of study than we prescribe. Ordinarily, the German schools open in summer 
at 7 o’clock in the morning and close at 4 o’clock in the afternoon, with two hours 
of recess during midday. In winter the hours are shorter, but by their continua- 
tion system, like our night schools, the studies of the pupils are continued during 
the evenings just as rigidly as during attendance at the public school in the day- 
time. 
TRUANCY ACT. 
By the truancy act of 1891 an attempt was made to improve the compulsory fea- 
tures of our school law. I think the experience of the next few years will show that 
the small residuum of truant children, whose evil habits the act was intended to 
correct, has been very much reduced. The rigid enforcement of the act by the public 
authorities, Iam convinced, will have a very salutary effect upon the indifference 
of both parents and children. The number of convictions in 1891 was 7, and in 
1892, 49.

EDUCATION IN ONTARIO. 249 
PROGRESS IN ADVANCED SUBJECTS. 
There has been a gratifying increase in the number of pupils studying the advanced 
subjects in the public school course, such as history, geography, and grammar. 
Taking the statistics contained in the annual report of the inspectors as a basis, it 
is beyond question that the attainments of the pupils of the public schools of the 
Province are considerably higher than they were ten or fifteen years ago. In every 
advanced subject of the course there has been a large increase in the number of 
pupils. Even in the fifth form, which the department was said to regard with some 
indifference, there has been an increase of over 3,000 pupils in the last five years, 
although there have been drained from the public school to the high school in the 
same period about 8,000 pupils a year, who, had they remained in the public school, 
would have entered the fifth form. 
CANADIAN HISTORY. 
It is particularly gratifying to notice the increased interest taken in the subject 
of Canadian history—a subject which was first made compulsory for entrance to high 
schools by the regulations of 1885. In 1886 this subject was taken by 67,682 pupils; 
in 1892 it was taken by 135,968. It is impossible to estimate the effect which the 
study of the history of our own country will have upon the minds of those who are 
to be the future citizens and rulers of Canada. I believe that much of the wonder- 
ful power the American Republic has shown in absorbing and assimilating the large 
foreign population which has drifted into the Republic from all parts of the world 
was owing to the efforts made in the public schools of the United States to impress 
the school children with the advantages of republican institutions. Her great men 
formed the subject of anecdote and sketch in every text-book; her struggle for 
independence, the courage of her generals, the eloquence of her statesmen, her litera- 
ture, her natural resources, in fact, éverything she was and everything she expected 
to be, were made the subject of study and of declamation, and every child on leaving 
school was made to feel that the American Republic, if not representing the whole 
world, represented at least the most important part of it. 
In the same way the study of the history of the Fatherland is made an important 
patt in the curriculum of all the schools of Germany, from the volkschulen to the 
gymnasien. In her dark days, when humbled and crushed by the first Napoleon, 
Frederick William announced to his disconsolate subjects ‘“‘the State must make 
good through intellectual power what it has lost in physical strength,” and straight- 
way began the organization of a school system of which loyalty to the German 
Empire may be said to be one of its corner stones. From its earliest history down 
to its triumphs before Sedan every event calculated to stimulate attachment to his 
native land or to increase his admiration of the national character of the great 
leaders of public opinion is daily presented to the pupil for the purpose of strength- 
ening his interest in the country to which he belongs. 
In England, strange to say, the subject of British history occupies a secondary 
place in the school curriculum. It is at present an optional subject, and the only 
incentive to teacher or pupil to take it up is the mercenary one that by so doing the 
school will receive a larger grant. Out of 5,006,979 pupils enrolled in the schools of 
England and Wales in 1892 only 90,070 pupils were presented for examination in all 
the specific subjects, English history being one of these subjects. It is but proper 
to say, however, that a series of readers in British history is required to be used in 
every school from the second standard upward, so that much of the knowledge 
obtained in this country by the use of a text-book in British history is obtained 
in England by the use of readers specially prepared and which are supplementary 
“to the ordinary school reader. 
A few months ago, when the education department relieved candidates for entrance 
to the high school from an examination in British history in order that greater atten- 
tion could be given to the study of Canadian history, an outcry was raised by the 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
250 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  opposition press and tle historic charge of disloyalty was hurled against the Govern- 
ment. It may be that in its zeal to promote a Canadian sentiment the education 
department went too far in the first instance to make Canadian history compulsory. 
It may be that the practice of other nations, such as the United States and Germany, 
who had to deal with mixed communities, as we have in Canada, was at fault. It 
may be that to embody in the regulations of the department a course of study which 
presupposes greater attachment to our own country than is required by the depart- 
ment of education of England and Wales, was too great a stride for this generation 
to take; but whatever may have been the motives which governed the department, 
certain it is that at no previous period in the history of Canada has there been so 
much attention paid to the history of our own country, its relations to the British 
Empire, and the position it is destined to occupy, if it is true to itself, in the future 
of this continent. 
The object of relieving the pupils from the examination in British history was to 
give the teacher greater freedom in dealing with the subject and the pupils greater 
zest in its study. It is possible so to load our pupils with examinations as to make 
school life irksome and repulsive, and if there is one department more than another 
where the method of the examiner is calculated to destroy interest in a subject, it is 
in the study of history. -Examinations in history can not be framed so as to develop 
in the children either the true spirit of the historian or to disclose to their minds 
the aspirations which culminate in the great events which it records. The child 
may get that for himself by reading and meditation; he ought to get it from the 
teacher; he can not get it from the examiner. 
I hope, therefore, it will not be many years till we can say to the teachers of 
Ontario, “We have confidence in your work without an examination,” and to the 
school children of Ontario, ‘‘ Read the history of Great Britain for the purpose of 
absorbing the spirit of her institutions, the temper of her statesmen, and the courage 
and freedom-loving disposition of her people, and repeat it in the experience of 
Canada, clarified and sublimated by the genius of our own institutions, and you 
will have what is best in humanity and what is best in government as well.”    
   
PHYSIOLOGY AND TEMPERANCE. 
I can not dismiss this part of my subject without a word or two as to the extent 
to which physiology and temperance are receiving the attention of our public school. 
It was in 1886 that authority was given the education department to provide instruc- 
tion in this subject, Since that authority was given a text-book was prescribed, 
and although for several years the subject was optional, it was believed that public 
opinion would justify its being made compulsory, and this was done accordingly by 
the regulations of last August. 
Out of 201,649 who were required under the regulations to study this subject, 
171,594 were reported as receiving the requisite instruction. In addition to the 
study of the subject in the public school, provision was made for the instruction of 
teachers at normal and model schools, and every teacher since 1887 who has received 
a certificate from the education department has been required to pass an examina- 
tion as to his knowledge of the principles of physiology and temperance. Is it too 
much to expect that this action of the department will greatly aid the enforcement 
of any legislation that may be required further to restrain the liquor trattic? 
COURSE OF STUDY. 
The ccurse of study for the public schools has been very much simplified within 
the last ten years. The opinion at one time evidently prevailed that almost every 
subject within the range of human knowledge should be taken up in the public 
school. In 1871 our school curriculum consisted of fifteen subjects, all of which 
were obligatory, requiring the use of 24 text-books at a cost of $10.83. The course 
now consists of 9 compulsory subjects and 3 optional, requiring the purchase of only 
 
-P-A-G-E-261
  EDUCATION IN ONTARIO. 251 
9 text-books at a cost of $4.06. The judgment of the best educators is strongly in 
favor of a limited course of study for elementary schools, and by a limited course of 
study I mean a course embracing a few subjects well taught. It does not follow 
that because geology or astronomy is not included in the curriculum that an 
advanced public school pupil should know nothing of these sciences, but what is 
meant is that a knowledge of these sciences such as a child may be capable of 
obtaining should be incidental to the ordinary course of the school, and not made 
the subject of special study by means of a text-book. 
Within the range of our public school curriculum there is ample material with 
which to develop all the faculties which are supposed to be most active within the 
age limit of public school life. Imagination, and memory, and the reasoning powers 
and observation can all ‘be quickened and stimulated to the utmost of any child’s 
capacity as our curriculum now stands. If the true purpose of education be to 
develop power and concentration of thought, then as a necessary corollary the 
dissipation of energy leads to weakness. Better have a pupil an expert in the four 
simple rules of arithmetic than give him a smattering of all. 
  TEACHERS AND THEIR TRAINING. 
The teaching staff of the Province of Ontario now numbers 8,480, the number of 
females employed being 5,710, and the number of males 2,770. In the last ten years 
female teachers have increased by about 2,000, and male teachers have increased by 
about 300. The effect which the employment of so many female teachers may have 
on the formation of national character and the development of those influences 
which give vigor and strength to national life is too large a question for present con- 
sideration. Having regard to the influences on the child of the personality of the 
teacher, one would naturally assume that the more vigorous and forceful methods 
of the male teacher would more thoroughly arouse the latent energies of the child 
and train him better for a life of self-reliance and self-assertion, but the time is too 
short during which the sway of the female teacher has been exercised to form a 
judgment on this point. It is apparent, however, to the most superficial observer of 
the changing phases of school life that in recent years the arbitrary discipline which 
asserted itself by physical force has given way to the humane and sympathetic dis- 
cipline of affection and self-respect; that the schoolroom, so frequently the scene of 
angry denunciation and cruel torture to be avoided, shunned, and deserted whenever 
it was possible, is now resorted to with pleasurable anticipations, and is enjoyed 
for its happy associations as much as for the benefits which it produces, The great 
gulf which once separated the teacher from his pupils has been bridged over, and 
the feelings of dread and suppressed terror with which the child ever approached 
the teacher have been replaced by feelings of confidence and affection. This change, 
in itself a most important one, has been brought about largely by the influence of 
the female teacher. 
The tendency toward the employment of female teachers, increasing as it is in 
Ontario, is still greater in other Provinces of the Dominion, as well as in the neigh- 
boring Republic. Only 66 per cent of the teachers of this Province belong to the 
female sex; in Quebec the percentage is 86; in New Brunswick, 79; in Massachusetts, 
91; in New York, 83; in Connecticut, 88. 
Notwithstanding the great increase in the number of teachers, the teaching force 
of the Province is still inadequate, and in this respect the position of Ontario is 
inferior to any of the other Provinces or the adjoining States of the Uniun, as will 
be seen from the following comparisons of the number of pupils allotted to each 
teacher: 
In the Province of Ontario the average number of pupils allotted to each teacher 
is 57; in Quebec, 80; in Nova Scotia, 45; in New Brunswick, 41; in Maine, 18; in 
Iowa, 19; in Massachusetts, 36; in New York, 32.

EXPENDITURE. 
The Province of Ontario has been most generous in its contributions for all educa- 
tional purposes, and particularly in the liberality with which it has maintained its 
public school system. I am not able to say that the salaries of teachers are as liberal 
as I would desire, and yet they compare favorably with the average salaries paid in 
the other Provinces and the adjoining States of the Union. Our schoolhouses may 
be said to be as comfortable and as commodious as schoolhouses are in any country. 
In the last ten years we have expended on sites and buildings for school purposes 
the large sum of $5,371,661, and still the expense per pupil is certainly not excessive. 
The average cost for elementary education in the United States, according to the 
last report of the Commissioner of Education, was $17.22 per pupil; in the Province 
of Ontario it was $8.40; in Illinois it was $14.82; in Michigan, $14.70; in New York, 
$16.80, and in Massachusetts, $22.60. 
PROGRESS OF SEPARATE SCHOOLS. 
  It is also gratifying to notice that the separate schools have kept pace generally 
with the public schools. In nearly all urban districts the accommodation for sepa- 
rate schools is ample and the equipment all that could be desired. The boards of 
trustees, with commendable liberality, have increased the teaching staff from 210 
teachers in 1867 to 662 teachers in 1892, thus reducing the number of pupils per 
teacher from 91 to 56. 
The increase in the number of separate school pupils in advanced subjects was 
most satisfactory. For instance, in 1867 the number studying geography was 8,866 
and in 1892, 26,999; in grammar, 5,688 in 1867, and in 1892, 22,755; in arithmetic, 
10,559 in 1867, and in 1892, 35,936; in British history, 1,418 in 1867, and in 1892, 6,713; 
in Canadian history, 2,571 in 1867, and 11,493 in 1892. There were 11,056 pupils tak- 
ing physiology and temperance in 1892. 
The standing of the teachers has also improved. Last year two were holders of 
first-class certificates, 93 of second-class certificates, 193 of third-class certificates, 
15 old county boards, and 18 temporary certificates. 
In 1889 only 190 separate school teachers held certificates granted by the depart- 
ment; in 1892, 288 held departmental certificates. 
  TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
One of the most gratifying features, and the most hopeful as to the future results 
of our school system, is the fact that practically every school in Ontario is in the 
hands of a trained teacher. There is no phase of school work that occupies just 
now a greater portion of the attention of educators the world over than the profes- 
sional training of the teachers of elementary schools. When Von Humboldt, early 
in the century, began the organization of the schools of Prussia, he laid down three 
proportions: (1) Education shall be compulsory; (2) education shall be liberally 
aided by the State; (3) every teacher must be trained. 
The necessity for the training of teachers was also recognized in the reorganiza- 
tion of the elementary schools of Great Britain about fifty years ago. Horace Mann, 
who did so much for the schools of New England, and in fact for the schools of 
America, made the training of teachers the object of his special solicitude; and Dr. 
Ryerson, in inaugurating a school system for the Province of Ontario, as one of his 
first measures of reform secured the establishment of a normal school in Toronto. 
The large increase of normal schools in the United States and on the Continent is a 
sufficient indication of the importance attached to the training of teachers. Massa- 
chusetts, with a population but slightly in excess of Ontario, has 5 normal schools; 
New York has 11; Pennsylvania has 12; England and Wales have 44, and Prussia 
has 116. The time must come sooner or later when additional accommodation for 
normal school training must be provided in the Province of Ontario.  
-P-A-G-E-263
EDUCATION IN ONTARIO. 253 
There are two features of professional training peculiar to Ontario which must be 
noticed: (1) The county model school system, and (2) the provincial school of peda- 
gogy. In regard to both of these our position educationally is almost exceptional. 
I know of no other Province or State, except Germany, that has laid down the rule 
that no teacher shall enter upon the duties of his profession without special training. 
England has its army of pupil teachers, who may, in a certain sense, be said to be 
specially prepared before assuming their full professional duties; and, although there 
is much to say in favor of the English system, still, after a careful study of all its 
advantages, I prefer our own, and I believe that much of the prosperity of our schools 
during the last fifteen years is owing to the county model schools. 
The provincial school of pedagogy deals with a department of professional train- 
ing which everywhere, except in Germany, appears to be overlooked. Although the 
necessity for training elementary teachers is all but universally admitted, and gen- 
erous provision made for such training in almost every civilized country, it was not 
considered necessary that the teachers of high schools should be required to study 
the science or art of teaching. About ten years ago provision was made for the 
special instruction of the higher schools of Germany, with encouraging results. In 
1885 the first attempt was made in Ontario to provide similar instruction for the 
masters of our high schools, and three years ago the school of pedagogy, with a dis- 
tinct faculty of its own, was properly organized. New York State, within the last 
three or four years, has established at Albany a normal school on a basis similar to 
the Ontario School of Pedagogy, for the purpose of training the masters of grammar 
and high schools. 
Iam aware that in certain quarters the school of pedagogy is not regarded with 
particular favor, but I have yet to meet an intelligent educator, either in this coun- 
try or abroad, who does not consider its establishment as one of the most important 
steps which we have taken educationally in the last twenty years. When we reflect 
that nearly every teacher in our public schools passes through the high school; that 
every matriculant into our universities lays the foundation of future advancement 
in our high schools; that thousands of young men and women, from the farm and 
from the homes of our workingmen and our busy citizens, come under high school 
influences, it is not impossible to overestimate the effect which superior training of 
their masters must have upon their future lives. True, teaching power comes from 
study and experience, and no one who does not understand the processes by which 
knowledge is acquired and retained could discharge the duties of the teacher suc- 
cessfully. I hope before the session is over that the school of pedagogy will be more 
closely related to the Provincial University. By making it a purely post-graduate 
school we will maintain the high literary qualifications requisite for high school 
work; and by granting a degree in pedagogy, as I hope the university senate will 
agree to, we will have the imprimatur of the university, and in that way an addi- 
tional guaranty as to its efficiency. 4 
HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The growth of the high schools is the only remarkable feature of our school sys- 
tem that now remains to be noticed. In 1867 we had but 103 high schools, with 159 
teachers, attended by 5,696 pupils. The number of high schools in operation at the 
close of last year was 130, with 522 teachers, attended by 22,837 pupils. Thirty- 
three of the high schools have attained to the status of a collegiate institute. The 
number of pupils enrolled in the high schools represent a trifle over 1 per cent of the 
entire population of the Province; in the United States in the same class of schools 
the percentage is 0.58, and in Prussia, where great attention is paid to secondary 
education, the enrollment was 1.2. No less than 45 new high schools were erected 
in the last ten years, and substantial improvements have been made to 25. Nearly 
one-fourth, or 21 per cent, of the expenditure for teachers’ salaries is now paid out 
of the pupils’ fees. Ten years ago only 11 per cent of the teachers’ salaries was paid 
in this way. In the course of study pursued by high schools there appears to be a 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
  | ; 
. 254 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
general preference for the study of modern language compared with the classics: 
For instance, only 5 per cent of the pupils now take a Greek course, as against 15 
per cent taking the same course in 1867; only 40 per cent take Latin, as against 90 
per cent taking Latin the same year; in 1867 38 per cent of tho pupils studied French 
and none studied German; in 1892 the percentage of pupils studying French and 
German was 45 and 12 per cent, respectively. As evidence of the increased efficiency 
of the schools it may be stated that in 1867 56, or only 1 per cent of the pupils, 
matriculated into'the university; in 1892 the number matriculated was 471, or about 
2 per cent. 
It is gratifying to notice that many young men and women attend the high schools 
for the purpose of acquiring a superior education for its own sake. Although high 
schools were primarily established for the purpose of preparing pupils for the learned 
professions, such is the appreciation of their course of study now that thousands 
flock to them for the mental training which they afford. The sons of workingmen, 
of farmers, and of the mercantile classes, who have no other object than to fit them- 
selves for the ordinary duties of their callings, have found the high school course 
an exceedingly profitable one. Since 1872 no fewer than 16,601 left the high school 
for mercantile life and 12,504 for agriculture. 
Under our system of training teachers the high schools have within the last ten 
years been obliged to assume the nonprofessional course for the teachers of the 
Province, which was formerly done in the public and normal schools. The superior 
attainments of high school masters qualify them particularly well for the work of 
instruction in the nonprofessional subjects, and it is hard to overrate the advantages 
which young menand women enjoy in being brought into competition with each other 
at a leading high school to receive instruction from university graduates, many of 
them specialists in their departments. Were we to undertake as a Province the task 
of providing a system of training equally efficient by means of normal schools, the 
cost to the country would be greatly increased and without any substantial advan- 
tage by way of compensation; but from the organic connection which we have now 
established between all parts of our school system we are able to use at no additional 
cost to the Province our high schools for work which in the United States, in Eng- 
Jand, and in Germany is done in the normal schools at the expense of the State. The 
Province of Nova Scotia has recently followed our example and is now using the 
high schools and academies of the Province for the nonprofessional training of her 
teachers. 
It will be observed from the estimates that we have made no increase for the last 
three years in the grant to high schools. I hope the house will see its way before 
many years to supplement the increased liberality of the taxpayer by an additional 
grant. In 1867, when we paid but a trifle over $50,000 for high school purposes, the 
grant amounted to $9.43 per pupil enrolled; last year, although the sum of $100,000 
was paid for high school purposes, it amounted to but $4.38 per pupil, or less than 
_ one-half the amount per pupil paid twenty-five years ago. In the same period of 
time the expenditure for teachers’ salaries has increased from $94,820 to $472,029, and 
the total expenditure for all high school purposes from $124,181 to $696,114. The 
liberality of the legislature, having regard to the number of pupils enrolled, is not 
nearly as great as it was twenty-five years ago. If our high schools are to continue 
to be accessible to all classes of the people, they should not be barred by excessive 
fees. The Farmers’ Institute a few weeks ago adopted a resolution to the effect that 
“any interference with our high school system which would remove it beyond the 
reach of the poor and make higher education the exclusive property of the rich is 
not in the public interest.” 
DEPARTMENTAL EXAMINATIONS. 
The house will observe that I am asking for the sum of $16,000 for departmental 
examinations. This is a slight increase on last year, but will be recouped by the 
fees of candidates. The education department considers it but reasonable, if the
-P-A-G-E-265
  EDUCATION IN ONTARIO. 255 
country provides what is almost free education for the pupils attending public and 
high schools, that those who want a test applied to their attainments by which they 
can enter on an educational career for the purpose of their own maintenance should 
themselves bear the cost of this test. Formerly a great part of the sum now paid 
by the candidates was paid by county councils, and, as somebody must bear the 
experse of the examination, it is thought that those specially interested are not the 
persons entitled to relief. 
It might be interesting to the house to know that the system of conducting 
examinations by a joint board of the department and of the university has worked 
well, By means of this board we are able to obtain examiners of the very highest 
standing, and, as a consequence, the value of the certificate which they recommend 
is greatly enhanced. For admission to the examinations of the medical council it is 
the only standard now accepted. For university purposes it is also accepted pro 
tanto, and, inasmuch as candidates can prepare in the same class either for matricu- 
lation into the university, law, medicine, or a teachers’ certificate, the classification 
of the high schools is, as a matter of course, very much simplified. The generous 
acceptance of this standard by the different universities of the Province has contri- 
buted very largely to the success of the scheme. 
Another feature of this scheme which should not pass unnoticed is that it makes 
teachers to a great extent the guardians of their own profession. This is the case 
in law, in medicine, and in arts. In 1883 the departmental exantinations were con- 
ducted by men engaged in other callings, some of them young and inexperienced, 
others too much absorbed in their own professional work to sympathize fully with 
other professions. The year before I entered upon my duties the examination 
papers of candidates for teachers’ certificates were read by law students, medical 
students, lawyers in active practice, clergymen, and others with little or no protes- 
sionalexperience. Last year, and for several years back, these papers were read only 
by graduates of our universities actually engaged in teaching. 
TECHNICAL EDUCATION. 
The growth of mechanics’ institutes and free libraries in the last ten years is 
worthy of notice, the increase being from 93 in 1883 to 255 in 1893. The number of 
volumes issued in 1883 was 251,920, and in 1893, 1,415,867, an increase of nearly 600 
per cent. I am asking for an additional grant this year for mechanics’ institutes, 
mainly that their advantages might be extended to the residents of small towns 
and outlying villages, and I do so with the greatest pleasure because I oLserve that 
the tendency toward the perusal of a higher class of literature is in the ascendant. 
For instance, in 1886 60 per cent of the volumes circulating by means of our 
mechanics’ institutes and free libraries was fiction; last year (1893) only 43 per cent 
of the volumes issued was fiction. I attribute this change very largely to the 
improved taste for substantial reading which we have been able to cultivate 
through the literature course in our high schools and collegiate institutes. The 
demand for the best literature of the language, either in history, in peetry, in biog- 
raphy, or in the magazines, is constantly growing, and I know of no better way 
by which a young man can continue his education after he leaves the public school, 
or even the high school, than by becoming a subscriber to a mechanics’ institute or 
a free library. 
  SCHOOL OF PRACTICAL SCIENCE, 
  The school of practical science has grown out of the school of technology estab- 
lished in 1871. Up till 1886 the work of the school was limited to the study of civil 
and mechanical engineering with such instruction in practical and analytical chem- 
istry as was necessary. Owing to the strong demands for more adequate provision 
for mechanics, engineers, architects, and miners, the accommodation in the school of 
science was greatly increased and such equipment provided as would facilitate the 
practical study of a complete course in practical science and technology.

In company with Professor Galbraith I visited, in 1886, some of the largest schools 
in the United States, such as the school of science in connection with Lehigh Univer- 
sity, Cornell University, Columbia University, the School of Technology at Boston, 
and other schools. The basis of the South Kensington School in London was also 
considered and the faculties in the school of science were, as a consequence, greatly 
enlarged. The new buildings projected in 1886 were completed in 1890 and formally 
opened in 1891. The total cost of the building and equipment, including the old 
building now used for chemistry and mineralogy, was $220,000. 
It is most satisfactory to know that the provisions made for technical education will 
now compare favorably with the best institutions on the Continent. No where in 
Canada, at all events, unless it be at McGill University, is there such ample provision 
for the education of engineers, architects, and mechanics, and in no school in the 
United States, unless it be the Boston School of Technology, is there a school supe- 
rior to that now established in Toronto. 
The course of study includes mechanical, electrical, and mining engineering, with 
full courses in architecture and analytical and applied chemistry. By the appoint- 
ment of Professor Coleman the department of mineralogy, metallurgy, and assaying 
has been greatly strengthened, and although not as yet as complete as I would desire, 
nevertheless the work done must ultimately prove of the greatest value in the deyel- 
opment of the mineral resources of the country. 
That this addition to the educational facilities of the country has been appreciated 
is evident from the increased attendance of students. In 1882 the number of stu- 
dents in attendance was 18; in 1893 the attendance was 143, a very gratifying increase 
in such a short period. Twenty-six counties of-the Province and two districts and 
two Provinces of the Dominion are represented in the school and contribute among 
them 89 students; 4 are from the United States and the remainder from the city of 
Toronto. 
Apart from the advantages which must accrue to the country from the training of 
skilled workmen in the departments of engineering and architecture, the diversity 
of employment afforded by the school of science must prove of substantial advantage 
to the young men of Ontario. While it may be impossible by any action of the leg- 
islature to restrain the strong disposition which appears to prevail everywhere to 
enter the learned professions, it is without question an advantage to diversify the 
occupation of the people as much as possible. Skilled architects and engineers are 
in constant demand. The vast railway enterprises of the Dominion are calling for 
skilled mechanics. The development of electricity opens a new field for the genius 
of our people. The mineral resources of the country are waiting the Midas hand of 
the assayist. The growth of our large cities and the vast expenditures on water- 
works and sewage systems call for the well trained hydraulic and sanitary engineer. 
That the skilled labor required for these purposes can now be supplied within our 
own Province and by the judicious expenditure of the money appropriated by this 
legislature is a feature of the educational system of this country which should not be 
overlooked. I have great confidence, therefore, in asking the legislature to continue 
its liberality to the school of science. Its record shows that it is worthy of confi- 
dence, and the attendance from all parts of the Province shows the extent to which 
the instruction which it affords is appreciated. < 
  GENERAL SUMMARY, 
Since 1867 the sum of $12,372,922 was ‘spent by the education department for all 
educational purposes. Of this sum $6,229,410 went to public and separate schools, 
and $2,092,570 went to high schools; the remainder was spent on the training of 
teachers, technical education, and the maintenance of superannuated teachers. The 
average amount paid for all educational purposes during the administration of Mr. 
. Sandfield Macdonald was $295,962. The average amount paid during the last twenty- 
two years was $510,403, or an increase of 73 per cent. The last year of Sandfield

  Macdonald’s government the whole grant to education amounted to $351,306; in 1893 
she total sum expended for all educational purposes, leaving out civil government, 
was $662,520. 
The yearly average grant to public and separate schools during the Sandfield 
Macdonald administration was $167,540; during the last twenty-two years the yearly 
ayerage was $258,394, or an increase of over 50 per cent. 
The grant to poor schools rose from $5,590 in 1871 to $31,497 in 1893, to be further 
‘nereased to $45,000 during the current year. 
The grant for mechanics’ institutes, libraries, and technical education rose from 
$4,257 to $69,630 in 1892. 
During Mr. Sandfield Macdonald’s time the costs of adininistering the education 
department was 5 per cent of the average expenditure; during the last twenty-two 
years the cost of administration was only 3 per cent. During the last year of Dr. 
Ryerson’s administration the cost of administering the education department was 
$19,315; the year beforo I took charge of the department the cost was $20,309; the 
cost in 1893 was $19,890. 
Since 1871 the number of public schools established has increased from 4, 770. to 
5,903, the number of teachers from 5,476 to 8,480, and the number of pupils enrolled 
from 454,662 to 485,670; the number of: teachers trained in normal schools from 828 
to 3,038. Our high schools have increased during the same period from 104 to 128, 
the teachers from 239 to 522, and the pupils from 7,968 to 22,837. In 1871 we had 
but 1 normal school; now we have 2. In 1871 we had no county model schools; 
now we haye 59.- In 1871 we had no school of pedagogy; now we have 1. In 1871 
we had no art schools for mechanics; now we have 8, besides the school of science. 
In 1871 we had no properly organized teachers’ peunitee, now we have 69, attended 
annually by 8,142 teachers. In 1871 we had only 51 mechanics’ institutes; now we 
have 244, with 145 reading rooms. 
On every hand there has been growth and development. The liberality of the 
government has been exceeded over and over again by the liberality of the rate- 
payer. During the last twenty-two years about three generations of school children 
have passed from the activities of the schoolroom to the responsibilities of citizen- 
ship. May we assume that in the energy of our people, the stability of their char- 
acter, and the general moral tone of the community there is.reflected some of those 
qualities which it has been the purpose of the public and the high school to inculcate, 
WORLD’S FAIR. 
I can not close my observations without congratulating the house and the Prov- 
ince on the distinguished position won for the’ school system of Ontario at the 
World’s Columbian Exhibition. To place a young Province like Ontario in competi- 
tion with the States of the American Republic and with the monarchies of Europe 
was a somewhat severe test. It was no small honor, therefore, in the face of suck 
competition, to obtain an award for our exhibit as a whole, and particularly te 
obtain an award for our school system as a national system, completely organized 
from the kindergarten to the university. I am informed that this was the only 
award of the kind that was given. If so, it adds very much to its importance. 
Besides this award, which includes almost all others, we were awarded honors for 
our system of conducting the professional training of teachers, for our public and 
high school system, and for the excellence of our text-books and the system under 
which they were authorized. For the honors of this distinction no single person 
can establish an undivided claim. A school system, either in its main features or 
in its details, is not the work of a day. 
The governments which preceded this government, both in Ontario and in the old 
Parliament of Canada, the ministers and chief superintendents who were my prede- 
cessors, the inspectors of public and high schools, and the others officers of the 
department, the director of the exhibit and the commissioner appointed by the gov-

ernment, as well as the people of Ontario whose liberality made our school system— 
all possibly have a right to share in this distinction. An honor so worthily obtained 
will, I hope, be carefully guarded. The man who would imperil our school system 
by partisan criticism should meet with undisguised opposition; the secretary who 
would introduce any element of disintegration, either into the organization of the 
system itself or into the public sentiment by which it is supported, should be treated 
as an open and avowed enemy, and he who by paper or by speech attempts rather to 
discredit than to improve the work already done should be regarded as an incendiary 
applying a flaming torch to one of the historic cathedrals of the mother country. 
IL.—Epucarion IN New ZEALAND. 
  The report of the Commissioner of Education for 1890-91 contained a 
paper on “Secondary education in New Zealand,”! prepared by Hon. 
Sir Robert Stout, K. C. M. G., formerly minister of education and pre- 
mier of the colony. He introduced his subject by a brief outline of the 
system of public instruction and closed with an account of the univer- 
sities, especially as related to the secondary schools. For the following 
statement, showing more fully the organization and present work of 
the universities and also comprising particulars relative to technical 
instruction in the colony, the office is indebted to Mr. Mark Cohen, 
editor of the Dunedin Evening Star: 
The annual meeting of the senate of the New Zealand University was held at Auck- 
jJand this year under the presidency of the chancellor (Sir James Hector). It must 
be borne in mind that our university does not teach; it merely examines, The teach- 
ing is done by the affiliated colleges, which are entirely independent of the university. 
There are three of these colleges—one at Dunedin, another at Christchurch, the third 
at Auckland, and Parliament is now being petitioned to make the necessary provi- 
sion for the establishment of the fourth at Auckland. The senate is a peripatetic 
body, meeting annually in one of the chief cities, its principal work consisting of 
appointing examiners, arranging for the conduct of examinations, prescribing the 
work, and conferring scholarships and degrees according to the reports of the exam- 
iners, who are resident in England for the most part. 
The revenue of the university is close on $20,000, of which $15,000 is provided by 
Parliament, and $6,750 are expended on scholarships and a little over $10,000 in 
examiners’ fees. Last year 903 candidates presented themselves for examination in 
all braniches—matriculation, medicine, law, arts, science, scholarships, and honors— 
compared with 782 in 1891, and the percentage of passes was eminently satisfactory. 
Among the degrees conferred was that of doctor of science on Mr. Charles Chilton, 
rector of the high school at Pat Chalmers, near Dunedin—the first degree of its class 
gained in any of the Australian colonies. The principal matter discussed by tho 
senate was a proposal by Auckland College to discontinue the appointment of exam- 
iners in England, and to change the existing system of college work under which 
the academic year is divided into two terms. They suggested that the year’s work 
should be spread over nine months and be divided into three terms; and that, in 
order to get rid of the delay and Jessen the expense, the English examiners should 
be dispensed with and examiners be appointed either in the colony or in Australia.

But it was clearly shown that the entire fabric on which the memorialists had con- 
structed ‘their petition was based on false conclusions. It was proved that the time 
given to tuition in-our colleges was:equal to that of any university in the world, and 
that-as much ‘time was given to lectures as in either Australia or England, and that 
the proposed change would not tend to-economy. The senate were unanimous ‘in 
approving of the English examiners and indorsed Chancellor Hector’s view thatthe 
university derived immense advantage ‘from-securing in that capacity the services of 
some-of the most-eminent literary and scientific:men in Great Britain. 
The report of ‘the University:of New Zealand just issued contains afew items of 
interest. In the first calender, published in 1873, there were entered 17:matriculated 
students, allmen. In 1875 one female matriculated student was chronicled among 
50men. During 1891-92 there were attending lectures at the colleges at Dunedin, 
Christchurch, and Auckland 705 students—of this number there were in all 378 
female students—118 matriculated female students, as against 261 males; 160 unma- 
triculated females as against 166: males. There is no British university—probably no 
university: anywhere—that :can show:such a large proportion of women students. 
Between 1886 and 1892 93 junior scholarships were granted by the university, and-of 
these 40 were gained by girls. During the same period 188 students have received the 
B. A. degree, and-of these 46-were females. The M. A.degreo is now held by 128 New 
Zealand graduates; and of these 34 are women. But of the 100 senior scholarships 
granted after three years’ college-work, when the candidate is completing the B. A. 
examination, only 16 fell to women between 1876 .and 1892, and of the 58 graduates 
who gained the M. A. degree with first-class honors-during the same period only 10 
were women. 
On April 8:Otago University celebrated its majority witha speech day. There was 
a goodly gathering of the alumni and friends-of the institution, and the venerable 
chancellor (the Rev. Dr. Stuart) presided. The most interesting address delivered 
on the occasion was ‘that by Dr.:Shand, :professor-of mathematics, who sketched the 
work done by this university during the past twenty-one years. It was opened in 
July, 1871,0n premises (now used as:a bank) in the very center of the business part 
of Dunedin with a staff of professors—classics and English (Sale), mathematics and 
natural philosophy (Shand), and: mental and:moral science (Macgregor, now inspector- 
general of hospitals for the colony). 
In 1872 .a chair. of chemistry and mineralogy (Black) was established; in 1873 the 
faculty of law, with Mr. (now Sir Robert) Stout as the first lecturer; in 1875 the 
medical school was founded, with Professor Coughtrey as the first demonstrator of 
anatomy and professor .of :physiology, to ‘be succeeded in 1877 by Dr. Scott, the 
present dean-of the faculty of medicine; in 1877 Captain Hutton was appointed 
professor of natural science, ‘to be:succeeded in 1880 by ‘its present incumbent, Prof. 
Jeffrey Parker; in 1878 a school of mines was established, with Professor Ulvich -at 
its head, and in 1891 the latter was given the assistance of Mr. D. Wilkinson, from 
the School.of Mines, London, as lecturer on metallurgy. 
The Presbyterian Synod of Otago has indorsed three chairs—ment&l and amoral 
philosophy (Dr.Salmond), English language and literature (Professor Gilroy), and 
natural philosophy (Dr.Shand). Thus the staff in the faculty of arts increased front 
3 professors in 1871 to 7 professors and 2 lecturers in 1893, while the whole-teaching 
staff of the university had increased from 3 in 1871 to 26:professors and lecturers in 
1893, exclusive of ‘the honorary medical staff of the Dunedin Hospital who are ex officio 
the university’s lecturers on clinical medicine and surgery. When the university 
opened its doors it had 81 students, none of whom had to pass a matriculation 
examination. In 1872only 7 candidates passed that-examination and the attendance 
consequently fell to 70, and in 1874 it dropped to 50, its lowest point, due to the 
entrance examination and thenatural process of weeding out incompetent students. 
The number has gradually risen:since, till in 1892 the attendance was 212, the classes 
taken were 568, and the matriculated students 178, or 83-per cent. As tothe results 
of the teaching:

  For the quinquennial period ending in 1877 only 5 degrees were obtained and 1 
student took honors; in the period ending 1882, 19 degrees were taken and 3 students 
took honors; in the period ending 1887, 56 degrees were obtained, 12 students taking 
honors; and in the last period ending in 1892, and including the latest examinations, 
143 degrees were obtained and 44 students took honors. Of the whole number of 
23 degrees that were obtained 189 were in arts and science, 9 in law, and 25 in medi- 
cine. To quote Dr. Shand: ‘I venture to suggest that these figures indicate a sat- 
isfactory rate of progress, and the progress is due.in part to the expansion of the 
institution, in part to the marked elevation of school education in this district, and 
in part to the improved tone existing among the students. 
Technical instruction is making headway in the colony, thanks to the enthusiasm 
of a number of gentlemen in the trading and manufacturing centers. After a great 
deal of agitation the legislature has, during two sessions, voted $4,000 per annum 
toward the encouragement of technical education, the vote being distributed in the 
proportion of £1 to every £1 locally raised by subscription. But it is felt that this 
is placing the so-called technical schools on an insecure footing; that it is too much 
like a hand-to-mouth existence, and the present minister of education intends ask- 
ing Parliament to pass a bill which will give a per capita allowance to every student 
who passes examination by a Government inspector in certain specified technical 
subjects. 
At Dunedin, the technical institute, which owes its origin mainly to the enthu- 
siasm of Superintendent Thomson, who is one of the science teachers at the boys’ high 
school in that city, has been in existence exactly three years, and has so far done 
good work, several of its students having been enabled to proceed thence to the 
matriculation examination of the New Zealand University, and, passing it, have 
© entered on the arts and mechanical courses of the Otago University, which is one of 
the teaching colleges of that institution. This year’s report of the committee of man- 
agement (mailed herewith) is one of encouraging progress. Of the 364 students who 
enrolled themselves nearly 60 per cent were lads and girls who, having passed the 
“compulsory standards” of the primary schools, availed themselves of this opportu- 
nity of self-improvement in some branch of study that is likely to be of service to 
them in the business on which they are now engaged. 
Owing to the want of suitable premises the committee have not been able till the 
present year to take up the truly technical side of their work, but that difficulty has 
now beén overcome, and tais term the curriculum includes instruction in plumbing, 
carpentry, wood and metal turning, wood carving, and typewriting. The manage- 
ment of the school is intrusted to a number of educationists, who are annually 
selected by the subscribers. At Auckland a similar institution has just been estab- 
lished under the more ambitious title of the Workingmen’s College, which will be 
managed by a council, partly chosen by subscribers, and partly elected by the city 
council, the governing body of Auckland College, the governing body of the Auck- 
land Grammar School, the education board of the.Province, the Employers’ Associa- 
tion, and th® Trades and Labor Council. Its session will be considerably longer 
than that at Dunedin, viz: from February to November, while the Dunedin institu- 
‘tion usually opens its doors in April and has @ifficulty in keeping its students 
together after October. 
The Auckland institution proposes to be affiliated with the South Kensington Art 
Department, and its curriculum embraces freehand drawing; practical, plane, and 
solid geometry; mechanical drawing and machine construction; coach building; 
architectural drawing and building construction; chemistry; dressmaking, domestic 
economy, arithmetic, algebra, mathematics, English and English literature; French, 
and bookkeeping. In Wellington a commencement has been made under the director- 
ship of Mr, A. D. Riley, the drawing teacher under the Wellington education board, 
who may be considered a technical expert, and at Invercayell and Christchurch 
organizations will shortly be in existence for giving instructions on similar lines
-P-A-G-E-271

to those followed in Dunedin and Auckland. There is therefore reasonable grounds 
for anticipating that Parliament will soon be invited to increase the grant in aid of 
technical education. 
Mr. Cohen adds the following particulars, derived from the report of 
the minister of education (Hon. W. P. Reeves) for 1892-93: 
For the first time since the inauguration of our educational system in 1877, the aver- 
age attcvdance during the last quarter of 1892 numbered for all the schools in the 
colony upward of 100,000 children, exceeding the record for 1891 by 4,653. It is 
noteworthy in this connection that, for each of the fifteen years during which the 
education act has been in operation, each succeeding year, in respect to average 
attendance both for the fourth quarter and the entire year, has gained steadily on 
the preceding year. The ratio of average attendance to the mean roll for the year 
was 80.6 per cent, which is the highest yet recorded. There was very little change 
in the relative proportions of the ages in the public schools. There is a slight 
increase in the proportion of children who remain at school after passing their 
thirteenth year, the percentage now standing at 14; but, our factories act notwith- 
standing, the great bulk of our- children leave the schools immediately after the 
compulsory standard has been passed, and either assist the household or enter on the 
battle of life. 
In 1878, when the act came into operation, the average attendance only numbered 
45,521. The number of pupils has doubled itself in the intervening fifteen years, 
due primarily to the natural increase of population, and due in no small degree to 
the acceptance of the system by the colonists and to the steadfast policy of each 
administration, which has taken care that a school shall be planted alongside of 
every knot of fresh settlers. The total cost of our public school system in 1892-93 
was £479,114; in 1877 it was £308,000.

India (British provinces and native States): Area, 1,560,160; population, 287,223,- 
431 (1891). 
On the 3d of February, 1882, the Government of India appointed an 
education commission, with a view to inquiring into the working of the 
existing system of publie instruction and to the further extension of 
that system on a popular basis. The system has been developed in 
accordance with the policy outlined in the dispatches of 1854 and 1859, 
the former being the date at which the education of the whole people 
of India was definitely accepted as a state duty. 
As set forth in the dispatch of 1854, the state undertook (1) to give 
pecuniary assistance on the grant-in-aid system to efficient schools and 
colleges; (2) to direct their efforts and afford them counsel and advice; 
(3) to encourage and reward the desire for learning in various ways, but 
chiefly by the establishment of universities; (4) to take measures for 
providing a due supply of teachers and for making the profession of 
teaching honorable and respected. 
The second great dispatch on education, that of 1859, reiterated and 
confirmed the provisions of the earlier dispatch, with the single excep- 
tion of the course to be adopted for promoting elementary education. 
It was noted that the native community failed to cooperate with the 
Government in promoting vernacular education, and strong doubts were

  262 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
expressed as to the suitability of the grant in aid system, as hitherto 
in force, for the supply of vernacular education to the masses of the 
population. Such vernacular instruction should, it was suggested, be 
provided by the direct instrumentality of the officers of the Govern- 
ment, on the basis of some one of the plans already in operation for the 
improvement of indigenous schools or by any modification of those plans 
which might suit the circumstances of different provinces. 
The expediency of imposing a special rate on the land for the pro- 
vision of elementary education was also commended to the careful con- 
sideration of the Government. In short, these instructions confirmed 
the principle of incorporating and improving the existing indigenous 
schools, rather than of inducing the people to set up new schools under 
the grant in aid systems then in force; but they also sanctioned the 
establishment of new schools by direct departmental agency. Accord- 
ingly, the local governmerts considered themselves free to adopt which- 
ever system seemed to be best suited to local circumstances. 
In the instructions to the commission created in 1882 attention is 
called to the fact that, although the development of elementary educa- 
’ tion was one of the main objects contemplated by the dispatch of 1854, 
owing to a variety of circumstances more progress up to the present 
time has been made in high and middle than in primary education. 
While there was no disposition on the part of the Government to check 
or hinder such progress, it was submitted that the means by which 
elementary education may be extended and improved should be their 
principle care. 
Tn the investigation, which lasted from the 10th of February, 1882, to 
the 16th of March, 1883, the commission embraced every grade of instruc- 
tion and all classes of schools as well as the particulars of administra- 
tion, finance, and legislation. 
A summary of the report of the commission was presented in the 
Annual Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1883-84.1 The 
Government of India has since published two quinquennial reviews of 
the progress of public instruction in all its branches. The substance 
of these later reports was brought into very concise form in a paper 
presented before the Bristol Royal Statistical Society, by J. A. Baines, 
esq., C. 8. I. The portion of this paper dealing directly with the sta- 
tistics of education is here reproduced. As introductory, it should be 
said that Mr. Baines discussed the subject from the standpoint of an 
intimate personal knowledge of all the conditions involved. Of him- 
self he says: 
In the part of India where I have been chiefly employed in administrative work 
it is the rule for what are known as the district officers—a comprehensive term which 
I fear I can not spare space to explain here—to inspect all the primary schools that 
lie within their range during the annual tour in the rural tracts. The inspection is 
directed not so much to the proficiency of the pupils in their studies, which is tested

by the departmental officers, as to the general condition of the institution in regard 
to such matters as attendance, punctuality in registration, and writing up current 
records, provision of furniture, cleanliness of the school premises, and similar non- 
professional essentials. It is the custom, however, on such occasions to gratify the 
master and the lecal board of management or the parents of the pupils by a cursory 
parade of the different classes in the school, and to note down one’s general impres- 
sion or any special merits or defects that may have attracted attention. This, then, 
is the extent to which probably nearly every member of my profession is competent 
to judge of matters educational, and it obviously covers but one section, though 
that is the largest and most important of the population under instruction. It is 
that in which the masses, among whom the bulk of our work lies, are chiefly inter- 
ested, and it is that again which, under the system in force in several of the Proy- 
inces, scems as a feeder to the institutions of a higher grade, and where accordingly 
one finds in embryo the pupil who is met later in life in a court or offices of the 
district, or in even higher functions. 
Ipersonally have had the further advantage of having been for a few months’ an 
educational inspector, and though my experiences in that capacity gave me no right 
to speak as an authority, they were sufticient to give mo a certain insight into the 
system and to enable me to read between the lines of the statistics, selections from 
which I have to present to you hereafter. 
It should be premised also that the interest of the portion of the 
paper here reproduced is greatly enhanced in the original by the 
author’s analysis of the social and industrial conditions of the country. 
Interesting and valuable as this portion of the paper is, the limits of 
space forbid its full presentation. A single paragraph, in which the 
writer has summed up the conditions that exercise a paramount influ- 
ence upon education in India and differentiate this from other coun- 
tries, is here quoted: 
Ihave hitherto spoken of the population as consisting of only two sections; one 
preponderately numerous, the other very much the reverse. I have divided the com- 
munity into, first, a large body of agriculturists with a small contingent of handi- 
craftsmen working on a small scale, and, secondly, into an enormous aggregate of 
independent village communities with a minute sprinkling of towns of above the 
size of a local market. But the next social units with which it is necessary to my 
subject that I should deal are of a very different character. They refer not so much 
to the occupation and functions of the people or to what may be called, on a small | 
scale, their political congregation, but to what, from an educational point of view, is 
much more important; that is, their religious, their ceremonial, and, above all, their 
domestic relations. I speak of what are known tous by the Portuguese name of 
castes. I can only touch here upon the barest outlines of this complicated subject, 
and will just bring forward enough of its main features to explain its great, indeed 
we may almost say without exaggeration, its overwhelming influence upon the educa- 
tion of the majority of the Indian population. 
The caste system, indeed, nominally prevails, strictly speaking, among the Brah- 
manic community alone; that is, among those who accept Brahmanic ministrations 
and recognize the religious and social preeminence of the Brahman. But in prac- 
tice there are few sections of the community that are free from it. The bulkof the 
Mussulmans in India are local converts from the Brahmanic fold and have preserved 
to a great-extent their former unregenerate social observances and traditions. The 
Jains and Sikhs are simply schismatics. The forest tribes occupy the border iand 
between Brahmanism and the organized and animistic creeds of their ancestors. 
Those who remain in the woods are staunch to their ancient faith, and have their 
‘own priests and ceremonials. The fringe that lives adjacent to the plains is gradu- 
ally being absorbed into Brahmanism by means of caste inducements. not by anything

in the nature of proselytism or conversion, so that we may roughly say that, except 
among the frontier tribes of the northwest, where Islam is strong and tribal feeling 
stronger, and among the Buddhists of Burmah, a portion of the Christian converts 
and the small communities of the hill tracts, there is a general adherence to the caste 
system. Even foreign tribes, such as the Parsis and Beni-Irael, or Marathi-speaking 
Jews, have acquired a considerable dash of the prevailing sentiment regarding this 
matter. 
Mr. Barnes introduces the strictly educational part of the paper 
with the following table, compiled from the census returns modified by 
the returns of the education departments. They relate to the British 
provinces, comprising a population of 221,172,952 (census 1891), and 
the native States, whose schools come under the department of public 
instruction of the adjacent local governments, as in Bombay and the 
central provinces:

  The paper continues: 
This, then, was the prevalence of instruction in the year 1891. Of the males, 11 
per cent, of the females of India 56 per 10,000 were then stated to be not illiterate, 
or 6 per cent of the whole community. There are three other aspects in which the 
return may be considered. First, it is allowable to deduct the children of both sexes 
under 5 years old, that is below school-going age, a process which raises the 
proportions to the extent shown below:

Ishould have liked to have dealt with the population of scheol-going age as a 
whole, but as a further return will show, when I treat of it presently, it is not*prac- 
ticable to thus distribute the pupils, since, though the masses may cease to attend 
school at 14, many leave long before this, while of the minority a good many con- 
tinue at school up to 19 or 20, and at college still longer. Roughly speaking, the 
proportion has been departmentally taken at 15 per cent of the total male popula-
-P-A-G-E-275

tion. In the case of girls it would not reach much above half that fraction, since it 
is rare to find them allowed to attend school after they have attained their marriage- 
able age of between 10 and 14, and the proportion under 5 is considerably above 
that of the boys. The next light in which to consider the distribution is territori- 
aliy or by provinces, a poini which can be dealt with summarily by reference to the _ 
following statement, which shows the proportion of illiterate of both sexes in the 
principal divisions of the country:

  As regards males, the difference between Burmah and the rest of the British Pos- 
sessions must be noted, as it is due to the religious system in the more remote prov- 
ince. Buddhism there demands that every boy should spend a certain number of 
years under instruction in « monastery, and the establishment of these institutions 
being an act of religious merit, leading to substantial benefit in the next incarnation 
of the pious founder, is a usual way of disposing of wealth, the accumulation of which 
is reprobated in the tenets of the Jocal faith, Nota large proportion, it may be men- 
tioned, of these Hpongyi Kyaungs, as they are called, are included in the depart- 
mental returns, though a good many of the private institutions are gradually adopting 
the modern text-books and methods of teaching mathematics and writing introduced 
of late years along with the British system. But when we come to the rest of India, 
instead of but little over half the male population being illiterate, we find the lowest 
proportion to be 85 per cent, and throughout a considerable portion of the country 
it rises above 93. All that need be remarked about the other sex is that, except in 
Burmah, the illiterate nowhere form less than 99 per cent of the total number. 
We haye, then, the distribution according to the mainreligious creeds. Here, again, 
no detailed comment is necessary, since nearly three-fourths of the community are 
returned under titles which include such wide divergences in their subdivisions as to 
be valueless as aggregates. We must take, for instance, the Brahmanic community 
by castes, and if we divide the Christians, similarly, into native converts and foreign 
sojourners, the results are very different from those given in the following table:

The only remarks on the figures, then, that need be made are that next to the 
European element, the Parsi is the least illiterate, and represents the only indigenous 
section which has an appreciable proportion of literate women in it, and the whole 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
266 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  Zoroastrian community numbers less than 90,000 souls. The Jains, which come next, 
show remarkable divergence between the figures for the two sexes. This is due to 
the fact that the males included in the area where education was returned at the 
last census are nearly all traders, while their houscholds have no such characteristic 
to raise them above the general dead level of their sex. The Jews, again, forma 
small and scattered community of less than 18,000. The Sikhs are cultivating land- 
holders of military proclivities, neither of which pursuits is favorable to the diffusion 
of book learning. They are probably, however, a little more literate than the table 
shows them to be, because many know their scriptural alphabet and literature, 
without being able to read the Persian character, which is that taught in the public 
schools of tho Punjab, The Buddhists, as I have just said, are concentrated in 
Burmah and the Himalaya, and can generally read and write. 
But there is another point in connection with the permeation of literature through 
the community at large on which the census alone throws any definite light. This 
is the component parts of the class shown above as not illiterate. The information 
collected relates only to those returning themselves as no longer under instruction, 
but no doubt many of the pupils of the higher institutions are here included, and 
even irrespective of these the return sufficiently fulfills its object of indicating the 
social classes that take advantage of the instruction placed within their reach. 
The tables treating on this subject are based on individual castes, numbering, of 
course, many thousands, all of which were classified into conventional groups, based 
partly on racial, but mainly on occupational or functional considerations; not neces- 
sarily the occupation, it must be understood, exercised in the present day, but that 
traditional in the caste and from which it derives its name. E 
The object of this combination, I need perhaps hardly observe to my statistical 
colleagues here, was not to serve any anthropological purpose, but merely to ensure 
uniformity of treatment in the twenty or so units of compilation over which the 
287,000,000 people were distributed, so that the central authority might be confident 
that in analyzing the aggregate of the returns he was dealing with material iden- 
tical, or nearly identical, in all cases. Now, as there are no less than 60 of these 
caste groups, I do not propose to do more than skim the surface of the very sugges- 
tive results of the above analysis. The first glance shows us two facts: One encour- 
aging from the standpoint of comparison with the past, the other rather startling as 
to the situation at present. We find, on the one hand, that among these 60 social 
groups there is not one which is entirely barren of people who know how to read 
and write. Of course, if we take individual castes, in different parts of India, there 
must be hundreds in the latter condition, but looking at society in what we may 
describe as strata, to use a geological term, it is remarkable that the lowest sections 
have managed to obtain a crumb or so of instruction, and it is quite certain that this 
was not the case half a century ago. Even now the share of the majority of the 
groups is insignificant, save in connection with this last consideration, but the 
encouraging fact is that it is there at all. This brings me to the second and less 
satisfactory aspect of the tabie. We find that the proportion of one-tenth of the 
group is literate in no more than 11 instances out of the 60, and that these 11, con- 
taining 52 per cent of the totalnumber of literates of the country, represent less than 
14 per cent of the population. Even from this selection we must make certain 
deductions, as in the 52 per cent are included nearly 14 per cent of Burmese, Euro- 
peans, and Eurasians. We then getthe results shown below, that over 86 per cent 
of the people share among them something under 48 per cent of those who can read 
and write, scattered over some 50 functional groups. 
The great agricultural and pastoral group, for instance, shows 24 per cent of liter- 
ate among its component parts. The artisans fall slightly below this, and no item 
of cither group is included in the inner circle of the 10 per cent. These figures show 
the comparative concentration of instruction within the classes to whom it is the
-P-A-G-E-277
  EDUCATION IN INDIA. 267 
traditional and direct means of livelihood, and its comparative neglect where it can 
only be of value as a factor in general education. But this is a matter on which my 
remarks must be deferred till we have done with the statistics of the subject.

   I therefore pass on to the last statistics which I propose to introduce. Theyrelate 
to the quality of the instruction, even as those already passed in review show its 
diffusion, and are taken therefore from the departmental returns of public schools 
by which are meant those conforming to the prescribed standards. There are, no 
doubt, over 39,000 institutions shown as private on the rolls, but most of them are 
merely denominational or rudimentary schools, with from 10 to 13 pupils apiece, and 
of a very fluctuating standard of learning and precarious existence. The following 
table contains the information in question :

It shows that 93 per cent of the boys and 96 of the girls are in the primary stage of 
instruction, and that over a fifth of the former and nearly a third of the latter are 
not yet advanced to the stage of reading printed books; 4 boys and 2 girls in every 
100 at school at all had reached the middle grade, and two more boys had got as far 
as the higher. When we have to consider the university and other institutions, we 
must abandon percentage and take to the fractions of 1,000 to get an appreciable 
proportion, either for boys or girls. This brief exposition is enough to show that 
anything beyond elementary instruction has as yet made little way in India, and [ 
fear that when we come to the tests applied to the work of the schools the real value 
of the figures will shrink into still smaller proportions. Generally speaking, the 
scheme includes a test of primary instruction at the end of the third or fifth year of 
attendance. The middle-class stage is closed by an appropriate examination, to 
which is added a special test for entrance to the lower clerical grades of the public 
service, while the high school, except where a special bifurcation of studies has been 
recently introduced, leads directly to the entrance examination to the university. 
‘The following table, which shows the number of boys considered sufficiently pre-

  Relatively few girls advance beyond the primary stage, but the still smaller num- 
ber examined seems better prepared than their comrades of the other sex. About1 
in 8 of the boys seem to have come to the test, and a little above half passed, chiefly 
owing to the greater success in the lower standards. 
In a paper treating of popular education only, it is not necessary to discuss the 
branches of instruction which are not strictly included under that term, so the uni- 
versities and their work may be said not to fall within the scope of my subject. But 
I wish to include in my general survey Indian education as a whole, and to praise 
accordingly the higher culture as we have done the rest. In fact, if we are talking 
of an educated community at all, we can not draw the line at the sixth standard, 
which represents in India even a lower degree of attainments than it does here, but 
we must imply something more extended. It is desirable, therefore, to see the actual 
extent of what is called the educated community. It has been shown already that 
at the present time only some 5 per 1,000 of the pupils of India have reached the 
_ university, including both arts and the professional faculties.’ The departmental 
returns show that during the last five years an average of about 18,000 annually 
appeared for matriculation, of whom a third only passed the test. Of the latter class 
something under 38 per cent proceeded no further than to the intermediate examina- 
tion; 14 per cent went on to a degree in arts, and some 10 per cent graduated in law, 
medicine, or civil engineering. To the great majority the entrance examination is 
no more than a qualification for service under Government or under such private 
employers as require assistants of the literary caliber implied by this test, and to 
such an extent has this tendency grown in some parts of the cduntry, that at least 
one university has been obliged to promote the establishment of an independent 
examination of the feeder schools, to serve the purpose for which its own doors were 
formerly besieged. As to the graduates, the universities have been now in operation 
for the last thirty-five years or so, and the total outturn in the arts faculty may be 
estimated at somewhere about 16,000; but the present vice-chancellor of the Bombay 
University, a Brahman of great distinction, has just been deploring the serious want 
of stamina he has noticed among university men, and their generally short lives, so 
that the actual number in existence must be considerably below the above figure. 
This, then, is the nucleus of the intellectual life of India, and, as I have said before, 
there is in it no representative of the agricultural or the industrial backbone of the 
country, even if there be any to speak of in the stages between this and the primary 
schools. 
I will not overburden this paper with statistics showing what has been done dur- 
ing the last forty years in the way of extending the provisions for popular instruc- 
tion, or how far advantage has been taken of these provisions. The information is 
available elsewhere in a form more explicit than any I could adopt within my present 
limits. Progress there has been, and very marked progress, though not altogether 
in the direction where it was most needed; and the foregoing portion of this paper 
is caleulated, perhaps, to indicate not so much what has been accomplished as the 
vast amount still to be done. It is on this consideration that I am laying so little
-P-A-G-E-279
  EDUCATION IN INDIA. 269 
stress on the system of education or on the State action with regard to it. Where 
there is no effective demand for education, or, as in India, a demand for it only among 
asmall minority, the patt that can be played by system or by State initiative or aid 
is insignificant, and its results are no more than an excrescence or parasitic growth 
on the life of the community. What has to be educated is not the mind, which can 
be reached from school or college, but the will, which is molded only by public opin- 
ion. The advance of the two independently of each other leads to results which are 
by no means free from difficulty and even danger. To take first the practical, and, 
I admit, the lower, side of the question, the professionally literate castes, as the 
returns show, are taking far more advantage of the educational facilities of the 
present system than the rest; so not only is the already wide gulf between the two 
being increased, but the too prevalent view is being emphasized and confirmed that 
instruction is merely a tool whereby a certain class gets its living, and with which 
the rest of the community has no concern. The notion once held that instruction 
would reach the masses best by ‘‘downward filtration” from the literate minority, 
was based on a misconception of the character of Brahmanic society, and has long 
since been abandoned. The hold of caste on occupation is strengthened by this 
unequal tendency, and the position of the lowest, who, like those at the opposite 
extreme of the social scale, are not bound down to definite functions, but are avail- 
able to undertake any class of labor, is stereotyped in its depression. 
I spoke, in the beginning of this paper, of a specially meritorious work to which 
_ tho efforts of Christian missionaries had been directed. This is in relation to the 
education of the classes whose contact and presence is traditionally polluting to the 
rest of the Brahmanic community. To enforce, in the case of such castes, the equality 
of treatment in schools to which, under the Queen’s proclamation of 1858 and the 
rules of all State departments, they are entitled, is equivalent to a decree of evic- 
tion against the rest of the pupils. Not one could, under pain of excommunication, 
remain, and the master himself would be in the same plight. I have myself seen, in 
place of the traditional rattan for corporal punishment, a row of hardened clay 
pellets on the tutorial desk, which were thrown with the accuracy of long practice 
at the impure urchins who were receiving instruction in a row outside the building 
occupied by the rest. The Government has had to recognize the prejudice, and to 
ordain that it should be met with tact and patience, but not directly infringed. 
Now the important feature in this digression is that these educationally boycotted 
castes contain over 57,000,000 souls, or 1 in 5 of the population. If it were not for 
mission schools and public institutions established in special tracts where such 
castes are strong, not a boy among them would be able to acquire the rudiments of 
learning. To return to the question of the relations between the minority and the 
masses, we already find that the real influences on public opinion are only to be 
learned in the court, in the field, at the well, or under the big tree in the middle of 
the village; and to go to the school or press for such information is to incur the cer- 
tainty of being misled. The boy of the literate class, if not of town origin, spends 
most of his youth in a town if he aims at secondary education, acquires urban tastes 
and urban views of life, which unfit him for sympathy with rustic concerns, just as 
the peasant complains that retaining his boy up to 14 in the primary school softens 
his hands and makes him unable to do his full day’s plowing. Then, again, the 
strict caste-régime that prevails among the literate community shows little or no 
signs of material relaxation, though in one or two points there are manifestations 
of revolt among a small minority who may finally succeed in leavening the mass. 
Thus the outlet for the youth of this class is annually growing narrower, and the 
market for their industry more glutted. India can only provide litigation for a cer- 
tain number of legal practitioners, and the higher class of students has hitherto 
shown little aptitude for any other profession but that and the service of the state 
or public bodies, which is, again, a more or less fixed quantity. Medicine and civil 
engineering, for which there is an opening, are only favored by a narrow class, not

270 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  always the élite of society. Further into ‘this question it is not mecessary hereto 
enter. It is when we turn to the moral aspects of the extension of intellectual 
education in a population subdivided and constituted as is that of India, that we 
find the gravest reason for deliberation. It is not’ merely that the rift between econ- 
viction and conformity is growing wider; that the head is growing faster than the 
heart, for that.is usual, if not: universal, in the experience of national education, but 
it isthe causes that tend to retard, and perhaps to prevent, readjustment, that must 
give uspause. The very first and foremost educative influence in a state is that of 
the family, not the school. There is:a ‘phrase of Richter bearing on:this that is 
worth remembering ; so much so, that I have:prefixed it'to‘the chapter on education 
in my -census:report; but,as Ido not flatter myself that I have thereby made it 
trite or universally known, it is worth citing again: 
“The wayes:of the ocean, ‘before reaching ‘the child, break against four walls 
which encompass the water.of his education or crystallization. Father, mother, 
brothers, and sisters, and a few extra people are his forming-world and: mold.” 
And in India, ‘as hope 'I have made clear, he has also an outer line of defense, in 
his-caste. But, withal, themain influenceis that of woman. I haveheard and:read 
a great deal on the subjection of women in India, and the deadening influences of 
the zeniéna system; but, as to the latter, can speak ‘from personal-experience, and 
history confirms it, that there are few shrewder negotiators, or persons more.alive 
to what is ‘necessary for their:own purposes or ‘the interests of their estates,than 
the ladies with whom one has to do business with a curtain between'us. As to their 
subjection, whatever may be the ‘theory regarding it—and I must admit ‘that the 
authorities use brave words—in practice, and again I-speak from varied occurrences 
Jaid before me in court and village—I have invariably found, if the:president swill 
permitme'to use an expression the political signification of which is scarecly older 
than ‘this paper, that the predominant member of the domestic:partnership was a 
certain old woman, generally the mother, not, as I have heard is ‘the vase in this 
country, of the wife, but of the husband. In India, in:fact, as-élsewhere, “she who 
rocks the cradle :rules the empire,” and when we find that her sway in her own 
immediate circle: is complete, her social aspirations are restricted within immutable 
limits, and those of her inferiors similarly kept from encroaching, and that-she has 
no eonception of any social grievance with which the elders of her caste are not 
competent to. deal, weshall not go'far wrong if we say her tendencies are likely to 
be conservative, and, looking at the very high place ceremonial and custom occupy 
in ker religion and in her domestic arrangements, more: probably ‘than:not she will 
be found to bea bigoted member of thatparty. Any inclination toward innoyva- 
tion, therefore, will be sure to be met with far more resistance from the women of 
the community than-eyen from the men, and what the latter is Ihave given the 
means of judging already. In‘the mere matter of book learning itis less surprising 
to find the women backward than in regard to the abandonment. of -social-customs 
which they no doubtrecognize as harmful to their sex, but which, nevertheless, like 
some other fashions, they consider it apoint of honor to endure. To-explain this, if 
is unnecessary to go further than the antipathy of the men, especially of the literate 
castes, to the acquisition of learning by their partners any more ‘than by their 
social inferiors.! If any other reason be required it:may be found in the'fact briefly 
mentioned above, that in proportion as the Brahmanic hold on the masses is-strong, 
the adoption of their ideal in regard to marriage is:prevalent, so that there is a con- 
tinnous tendency as wealth increases to lower the age of the bride, and to seclude 
the girls of marriageable age, both of which practices, I need hardly:-remark, have 
an influence fatal to anything beyond the very rudiments of learning. Thus it hap- 
pens that according to the census we find to every 1,000 males not wholly illiterate 
only 47 females of the same degree of acquirements, the disparity running in greater 
or less intensity through the whole community. 
  1¥For instance, out of about 15,000,000 of Brahmans, 1,957,000 of the males are 
returned as literate, but only 72,500 of the other sex.
-P-A-G-E-281
  EDUCATION IN INDIA. 271 
Nor is there at present any sign that the disparity is on the decrease. It may be 
said, of course, that within this last ten years or so female education has advanced 
faster than that of males, and the naked figures of the annual returns are called in 
evidence of this. Granted; but let us look if that is the real teaching of these fig- 
ures, Considerthe numbers involved, actual or relative. What a drop in the ocean! 
Ten years ago there were in every thousand women four who were not illiterate, 
there are now five. There has been a growth of secondary and middle-class educa- 
tion among them, but the tables show that it is confined practically to the small 
communities of Europeans, Parsis, and Christian converts, and has nothing to do 
with the masses. The number of pupils in training to take charge of girls’ schools _ 
has increased, but it appears due only to the accession of Christian converts, as 
no other caste will degrade itself to so publie a function. Now, the great bulk of 
these converts, and to the honor of the missions be it spoken, belong to the depressed 
or menial section of the Brahmanic community, and take their place in their little 
world, not according to attainments or conduct, but by virtue of their traditional 
and native position. They have no influence, therefore, outside their class room, 
and so far as the parents of their pupils are concerned, are admissible to no share in 
social life. This, again, is not conducive to the spread of learning among the women 
of the country. 
So long then, I repeat, as the disparity between the sexes in point of education 
continues at anything like its present extent, the influence of the home will be set 
dead against that of the school, except in so far as the latter acts merely as the agent 
for obtaining early in life a pecuniary position that will enable the recipient to dis- 
pense with further study. So long, again, as this mental divorce is the approved 
rule, all the education that can be imparted from without the home will be “of the 
man’s life a thing apart.” It will hang on him like Saul’s armor on the shepherd 
boy, and for all the help it may give him in the battle of life, the Goliath of ances- 
tral prejudice will die in his bed at a ripe old age. Knowing what it is my profes- 
sional duty to know of the sentiment and practice of the home circle and domestic 
surroundings, to hear the great English classics or the vernacular renderings of the 
political history of Europe or America from the mouths of the urchins in the village 
or district schools, always brings tomy mind Cicero’s question when he saw his rather 
diminutive son-in-law invested with the brand his father had borne in the civil war, 
“Who on earth has tied Dolabella to that sword?” In later life it is too often the 
same, and the great principles of morality and statecraft that have been the brand 
of victory in the West become in Oriental hands the court sword flourished to direct 
the movements of a sham fight in which neither morals nor policy are at stake. 
With policy we have luckily nothing to do on this oceasion. As to morals, though 
the results of a system of public instruction may not yet be apparent among the 
masses for reasons I have already given, the system has borne a fruit esoterically, 
or within the fold, which is not altogether palatable to the mental horticulturist, 
even if it be so to anyone else concerned. It is the results of testing intellectual 
. proficiency and depth by means which connote moral conditions which have not yet 
been developed in India. Examinations in this country are, relatively speaking, 
successful, because it can be assumed with reason that the moral fiber of a candidate 
is. up to a certain standard, so that it is necessary to test his intellect alone. It is 
not so in India, where the goal is considered attainable by the bypaths of morality 
as justifiably as by the highroad. In fact, in some parts of the country the art of 
swindling has received quite a fresh stimulus from the new field thus opened to it. 
Not a year passes without its crop of cases of personation, fraudulent acquisition of 
the examination papers, even when they are expressly printed in various towns in 
Europe; forged certificates of character, age, and departmental qualifications. In 
Bengal it is stated officially that detection is entirely dependent on accidental defects 
in the procedure, so that probably for every case found out ten pass unnoticed. In 
a lower sphere of the education of youth pupils are borrowed for a day from one 
school for the annual examination of another. The prosecution of a few masters for
-P-A-G-E-282
272 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  fraudulent or forged registers of attendance had the effect of temporarily stopping 
the practice of submitting registers at all. A district board found it necessary to 
abandon the custom of giving annual school rewards because of the fraud practiced 
in order to get them. A municipality in another part of the country reduced the 
E salary of a master who had offended one of the leading townsmen, first by expelling 
his son and secondly by refusing to give that promising pupil a certificate of good 
character on which he might appear for the university examination. In another 
similar case a fresh school was set up by the city fathers to ruin the too conscientious 
pedagogue. Finally, a master in a village on the border of a district got the reward 
_ at his annual examination, and then promptly transferred himself and his pupils to 
an adjacent village in the next district, where a second examination brought him in 
asecond harvest. The competition for promising boys in the aided schools of the 
capital of India, which is carried on by public advertisements offering rewards, by 
active canvassing, and by other means derogatory to the dignity of learning, such 
as tampering with registers, falsifying transfer receipts, and similar expedients, 
which outside the scholastic world would be called forgery, has, it is stated, mate- 
rially lowered the discipline of the whole body of pupils. The best prepared openly 
put themselves up to auction shortly before the examination. Others—I am quoting 
from the latest report to hand—confine themselves to sending anonymous accusations 
against the master or each other to the inspectors or other officials, In one case a 
riot was attributed by the master to ‘‘an improper sense of offended dignity.” In 
“another the inspecting officer, having asked the master to explain an intricate sum 
on the blackboard, was stoned by the loyal pupils as he left the building. One boy 
_in a high school, who had been punished, burnt down the school and the master’s 
vhouse.. The next day the temporary building to which the classes had been removed 
4 Was also set on fire, and the youth who was caught thus employing the resources of 
civilization spent some time in a reformatory. In the east of Bengal a more com- 
plicated occurrence is reported. The English school in the town had been burned 
_ down twice in the year, on which the native gentleman who was acting as assistant 
inspector naively remarks that it appeared as though the master had created enemies 
by too strict discipline, or that an unhealthy rivalry existed between this school and 
another. The latter alternative seems the correct one, as I find that in the course of 
the year the rival school was also burned down. 
The serious part of these events is not, in my view, the actual offense or the spirit 
which instigated its preparation, but the acquiescence in and the connivance with 
it by all who had any knowledge of what was intended or was actually going on. 
In the case of the fraudulent transfer of pupils and similar artifices to cheat the 
public purse or to profit by the wrong done one’s neighbor, not only every master 
round, every pupil implicated, but every parent must have been privy to the fraud, 
and acquiesced in the methods by which it was successfully carried into execution, 
and, remember, it is not the low-class hedge-schools where this goes on, but the sec- 
ondary and, even more, the high schools that feed the university, the entrance exam- ' 
ination to which is to nine out of ten of that class of pupils the end-all and be-all | 
of their education. It is after passing through an atmosphere such as that which 
this moral apathy proves to be prevalent that the highest product of the present 
system is thrown onto the world, and when we hear of the educated classes in India 
we ought to have a clear conception of the grounds on which the application of that 
epithet is based. We have to appreciate not what the mouth has learned to speak, 
but what the heart really cherishes. We have to consider what is the relation this 
~ class bears to the masses; what part it takes in the great life of the community; 
what is its numerical strength, and how far it is predisposed to admit the rest of its 
less gifted fellows toa share in the intellectual privileges on which it founds its 
claims; or how faritisinclined to perpetuate a traditional monopoly. What, again, 
is its attitude, not in precept, but in example, toward the deeply seated influences 
that impair the general vitality of the country and cramp its energies? I have
-P-A-G-E-283
  EDUCATION IN INDIA. 273 
touched sufficiently on all these questions to show you, to say the least of it, that 
they have more than one side, and that however glittering the surface that lies 
uppermost, it by no means follows that all below is gold. I have shown, also, the 
proportion borne to the people at large by the class which, by. the utmost extension 
of the term, can be called educated. 
It may be said that the progress of education, according to my view, has been 
insignificant. But remember, first, that forty or fifty years are as nothing in the life 
of a people. The great dispatch of 1854 closes with a phrase which is, I think we 
may all agree, well worth repetition: 
“To imbue a vast and ignorant population with a general desire for knowledge, 
and to take advantage of that desire when excited to improve the means for diffusing 
education among them, must be a work of many years.” 
We have also to accustom the people to a régime of equality, to which they are 
even now little more than strangers, and which they haye received timidly and with 
the suspicion born of centuries of experiences diametrically opposite in their nature 
to those to which they are now subjected. The sway of the sword has given place 
to that of the scales, wherein every person in the eye of the administration weighs 
equally before the law. 
Finally, are not we Western nations rather too prone to consider progress as a 
natural characteristic or tendency of the human race, and not to sufficiently realize 
the very narrow limits to which in that capacity it is confined? What people has 
shown it that has not been, at some time or other in its history, in touch, directly 
or indirectly, with that little spot on the north side of the Mediterranean where 
alone of all countries of the known world the spirit of progress has not been proved 
to have been implanted from outside? If it be an exaggeration at all, it is a 
splendid one of Sir Henry Maine, that, except the blind forces of nature, nothing 
moves in this world which is not Greek in its origin. How then is it to be expected 
that contact merely political between countries separated by half the world, whereof 
one alone has received the spark of Hellenic fire, will produce the same results within 
the same time, or measurable distance of it, as that of contiguous or colonized nations? 
The longitudes are too far apart for the administrative clocks to keep the same time, 
and a mean must be adopted which will satisfy the one that the other is moving, 
but not go so fast that the latter can not keep up with it. 
I do not take, I hope, too pessimistic a view of the subject of which I have been 
treating this evening, and I have nowhere asserted that the situation is approaching 
an impasse, though the advance has been in some respects singularly unequal. I 
look for the solution of the problem not to any direct effort on the part of the State, ~ 
of private enterprise, or of the literate classes, but to the stimulus of the steady 
advance of the masses in prosperity, in the educating influence of material cireum- 
stances, the opening of the mind by travel, commerce, and industry, all of which 
ar2 now in their lusty infancy. 
The following paper, presented before the Department Congress of 
Educational Journalism in Chicago, adds many interesting particulars 
to the present survey of educational agencies in India: 
EDUCATIONAL JOURNALISM IN INDIA. 
[By Thomas Denham, M, A. (Queen's College, Oxford), vice-prin cipal Teachers’ College, Saidapet, 
; Madras, late editor of the Madras Journal of Education.] 
In a paper on ‘‘ Educational Journalism in India” it is not necessary, even if it 
were convenient, to give a detailed account of every periodical of this class which, 
‘has appeared in India. Fortunately for the writer, but unfortunately for the cause 
of education in India, much of the information respecting these papers would 
scarcely deserve to be incorporated in such a paper as the present, except as afford- 
ing direct evidence of the low state of educational journalism in India. The writer

will therefore content himself with a bare mention of many journals the names of. 
which sufficiently indicate their scope. He will speak more at large of the few lead- 
ing representative journals, and, what appears to him of still greater importance, 
will discuss briefly the causes which are, in his opinion, mainly responsible for the 
deplorable lack of interest taken in educational journalism in a country in which 
education has made rapid strides within the last half century. 
Without doubt the leading educational journal in India is what was known up to 
within a few months back as the Madras Journal of Education, but which is now 
known by the more ambitious name of the Indian Journal of Education, Maidras, 
in this matter of educational journalism as in other educational matters, has given 
the lie to the opprobrious appellation by which she was designated by the other 
presidencies, viz, ‘‘The benighted presidency.” The journal was started in 1859— 
an important date, as it comes just after the great mutiny in 1858 and the estab- 
lishment of the Indian University, a date which practically marks the birth of 
educational journalism in India. The features of the Madras Journal of Education 
may be_gathered by a notice of it by the Madras Christian College Magazine in 
1892: ‘It now contains a larger number of short original articles than it formerly 
» did, while at the same time it devotes a considerable portion of its space to notes 
and news of general and local interest, dealing mainly, of course, with educational 
matters. Reviews and notice of works and of other educational reviews, the pro- 
ceedings of the director of public instruction, and educational notifications occupy 
aconsiderable portion of its space, and some pages, in which questions are asked 
- and answered, are set apart in each issue for the benefit of students. It is now a 
useful and interesting journal, and we hope that in its new and improved form it 
may haye a wide circulation.” 
For the greater part of its existence it was conducted by two well-known Indian 
educationists, Messrs. Fowler and Barrou, who for many years bore the burden and 
the heat of the day in what must have been generally an unthankful task. The 
journal now circulates throughout India, and is officially recognized in most prov- 
inces, and yet has not a greater circulation than 1,000 copies. Since January of the 
present year it has had the misfortune to change its editor twice. As the Indian 
Journal of Education its character has considerably changed also, having fewer 
original articles and less pedagogic information. It is safe to say that no similar 
_ periodical in India can approach it as regards its size, matter, and circulation. 
One other educational journal which was circulated throughout the Madras presi- 
dency may be noticed, as itis typical of the history of many similar journals in this 
country. In January, 1871, was published No.1 of the Mangalore Month and Educa- 
tional and Literary Record. This was a journal of 24 pages, edited by John Brad- 
shaw, M.A., then head master of the Government provincial school, Mangalore, now 
an LL. D. of Dublin, and world known as an editor of Milton and Gray’s works and 
Lord Chesterfield’s letters. The aims of this creditable little production are thus 
stated by the editor in the introductory number: ‘It will be a record of educational 
news and such intelligence as is likely to prove interesting to those connected with 
education in this country; as, however, it is principally intended for students, we 
purpose in each number supplying them with such information in matters connected 
with these studies as either may not be explained in their text-book or they might 
otherwise be unable to procure.” 
The editor calculated that about 200 subscribers at 3 annas (about 7 cents) would 
cover the expense of each month’s issue, and that if a sufficient increase in the 
-number of subscribers took place he would increase the size of the journal and 
change its name ‘‘ by embracing a wider circle than the locality of Mangalore.” In 
‘ spite of Mangalore being an out-of-the-way place on the Malabar coast and having 
no direct railway communication with the rest of the presidency, the merits of the 
journal were such that after six months the number of subscribers justified the 
editor in changing the name of the journal to the Madras Educational Record. In
-P-A-G-E-285
  
EDUCATION IN INDIA, 275 
the first number of the new venture one of the chief causes for the dearth of good 
educational journalism is alluded to: ‘‘That Madras is without an educational record 
worthy the presidency is not to be attributed to any want of ability or energy 
on the part of educationists, but finds its explanation in the nature of Indian 
society. Few care to embark on the undertaking, which, after it is fairly afloat, they 
may be compelled to relinquish from their being transferred to some other scene or 
sphere which may preclude their proceeding with it.” How true this statement is 
the history of the journal in question goes to prove; for after a successful career of 
eighteen months it ceased to exist, as Dr. Bradshaw, having been appointed an 
inspector of schools, found he could not continue to edit the journal while holding 
a traveling appointment. 
Of current educational journals in India, the Bombay Educational Record perhaps 
stands next to the Indian Journal of Education. It has flourished for many years 
with the help of Government support. For the last quarter of a century it has been 
under the editorship of Mr. J. B. Kirkham, who is now retiring after over’ thirty 
years’ service inIndia, This magazine contains little but departmental notifications, 
appointments, lists of prescribed books, ete. As a rule there are about two small 
pages of original matter, consisting of short, pithy notes on current educational 
questions. Occasionally good articles are reproduced from other educational mag- 
azines. It has a circulation of about four or five hundred. Such well-known men 
as Sir A. Grant and Sir James Peile have taken an active interest in its welfare. 
The little journal has always aimed at encouraging an accurate record of facts, a 
study of principles and their application to the peculiar circumstances of India and 
a professional spirit based on a high estimate of the work and office of the teacher. 
The Educational Magazine hails from Caleutta, and is the organ of the European 
Teachers’ Association at Caleutta. It is a small periodical with a small circulation. 
Tt contains little original matter, the magazine being chiefly made up of questions 
on school work and extracts. The magazine ought probably to be spoken of in the 
past tense, as the writer has seen nothing of it for the last twelve months and has 
no definite information regarding its existence. 
Besides these educational magazines there are other periodicals in India which 
though chiefly of a literary character yet give place in their columns to articles and 
discussions on educational topics of general interest. The Madras Christian College 
Magazine holds a peculiar place in the current literature of India. It is managed 
by one of the professors of the college who is assisted by the principal and the other 
professors. The articles are contributed in great measure by outsiders, and aro of a * 
general literary character. Details respecting the college appear from month to 
month. The magazine can searcely be called educational, nor is it a bona fide col- 
lego magazine in the sense that the students contribute to it or that it faithfully 
records the many agencies of the college. There are in fact in India very few col- 
lege or school magazines such as are common in the large schools in England, 
and which contain full details of school work, sports, ete., with occasional original 
articles and tales. 
One main reason why educational journalism in India is so rarely taken up by 
educated men has been already alluded to, viz, the frequent changes from post to 
post which fall to the lot of most educational officers in India. But apart from this 
deterring cause there are comparatively few Englishmen in India who take an interest 
in gencral matters of education outside their own special branch. Being members 
of the Government educational service their positions are assured, and so far as their 
own interests are concerned they see nothing to be gained by agitating for educa- 
tional reforms in a bureaucratically governed country. The climatic conditions of 
the country, too, are such that most men are content perforce with the ordinary 
discharge of their duties and shun such overwork as is often responsible for the 
sudden and utter collapses which sometimes overtake Englishmenin India. System- 
atic mental work of a severe nature is almost impossible after the college or school  
-P-A-G-E-286
276 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  closes for the day. Again, among the other necessary conditions of healthy living 
among Englishmen in India is the periodical furlough or leave of one or two years to 
Europe. But when all is allowed for it must be confessed that many English educa- 
tionists in India are regrettably negligent in the matter of educational journalism. 
As regards the natives of the country, it must be remembered that they can carry 
on work of this kind only under considerable disadvantages. Educational journals 
in India, if they are to have a far-reaching influence, must be conducted in the 
English language, the common medium of education and communication of the upper 
classes throughout the vast continent of India, If they make use of any one of 
the many dialects of India they at once limit their influence by appealing to a com- 
paratively small section of India society, and that not the most cultured portion. 
Every schoolboy in India can read more or less intelligently in English, and the 
educated native prefers to get his information through the medium of the English 
language, that language being capable of greater exactness of expression and being 
the door to a vast range of literature. It is a lamentable fact that the vernaculars 
of India are being increasingly neglected from a literary point of view, except for 
examination purposes. But English, after all, is a foreign language to Indians, and 
although they are at infinite pains to make themselves conversant with it, it is but 
natural that they should find considerable difficulty in expressing themselves clearly 
and forcibly in that language. In any case the task of conducting with credit an 
English educational journal is no inconsiderable one to the ordinary educated Indian. 
Then there is the question of poverty which must be reckoned with when account- 
ing for the small circulation of educational journals in India. Education, if it is to 
be given at all, must be given at a nominal charge, for the majority of students are 
admittedly poor. They will do anything to save the expenditure of a few annas. 
Journals and papers are handed on from one to another in such a way that there is 
no approximation between the number of subscribers and the number of readers of 
any particular journal or paper. 
Text-books, when once they have answered the purpose of the examination, are 
disposed of with a callousness which argues a singular lack of interest in the sub- 
jects which for the time being engrossed the attention of the student, but which 
are often so disposed of on the specious plea of poverty. But the writer is inclined 
to look for another reason why educational journalism is so little patronized by the 
natives of India. He finds it in the little interest which the ordinary student or 
teacher takes in matters educational—a lack of interest due to a low and false esti- 
  » mate of education, an estimate which values education mainly for its material bene- 
fits, an estimate due in part to inherent faults in the higher educational system of 
the country,and to the increasing number of the examinations which throw open 
the doors to the services. Moreover, the teachers of the country are not organized 
to look after the interests of education and their own interests. Associations of 
such proportions and wielding such power as the various associations in Amer- 
ica and England are unknown. What few associations do exist, and they can be 
counted on one’s fingers, have few members, are purely local, discuss purely literary 
and pedagogical questions, and have no influence among teachers or on the public. 
generally. 
Annual conferences of teachers are unknown; esprit de corps is wanting. The con- 
flicting interests of Government, mission, and native institutions may in part account 
for this. The minimum qualifications and resources of those who enter the teaching 
profession; the caste system, with the blight of its social ostracism; a bureaucratic 
system—all these may account for the absence of teachers’ associations in India, but 
the painful and palpable fact remains that such aids to the teacher’s position, to the 
cause of true education, do not exist in India. Did they exist, a different account of 
educational journalism in India would have to be written. There being no associa-; 
tions, there are consequently no organs to disseminate their views. Nor is there 
in India anything analogous to that excellent institution the Bureau of Education
-P-A-G-E-287
  
EDUCATION IN INDIA. 277 
as 1b exists in the United States of America, an institution which is the medium 
for collecting and disseminating interesting matter which concerns the welfare of 
education. 
We have spoken of the low estimate of education which the average student has 
‘of the benefits of education. To him it is the means to an end, the end being the 
passing of such examinations as will enable him to secure a competency in some one 
or other of the Government services. Students’ journals which would give hints for 
passing examinations might secure a fair circulation under proper management. 
Teachers, too, are more or less content in seeing that their pupils are well stored 
with just that amount of carrying knowledge which will enable them to pass exami- 
nations. They have little faith in new and improved methods for imparting knowl- 
edge and know little of educational systems outside their own. 
The people of India are strong in memorizing, but not so strong in assimilating 
knowledge and in mental productiveness. The universities examine, but do not 
teach, and the educational system generally tends to accentuate the memorizing 
rather than the assimilating faculties. Unfortunately, there is practically no edu- 
cational journalism to correct this tendency, to stimulate and inspire by proclaim- 
ing new methods, by discussing the merits or otherwise of outside systems, and by 
placing before the people a high ideal of the ends and objects of true education, 
by awakening a true regard for the profession among teachers and by giving them 
an esprit de corps which alone can raise them socially and morally in the eyes of 
the public at large. How much remains to be done this simple fact alone will 
show—that in a country whose population exceeds by five times the 50,000,000 of 
* the United States the leading educational journal has a circulation of 1,000 copies. 
Add to these reasons the facts that there are few educationists who have the time 
and not many who have the requisite knowledge of pedagogy to conduct high-class 
journals, that the editor’s funds will not allow of good articles being paid for, that 
specialists can find a ready market for their articles either in the better-class news- 
paper in India or in journals in England, and it need not be wondered at that there 
are no educational journals in India which can in any way approach the high-class 
journals of America and England. 
India has made rapid strides in education during the past forty years. There are 
some few.signs that she is awakening to a sense of what true education means. 
When that time arrives, she will give expression to her enlarged views in a journal- 
ism which may be worthy of her, and which, though it can only be fostered amid dis- 
advantages from which the educational journalism of England and America is free, 
will be worthy of a modest place beside the literature of these two countries. 
I append a complete list (so far as in my power to make it) of all the educational 
journals which are or have flourished in India. It will be seen that they are many 
in number, but that generally they have had but a short existence, and this for the 
causes which have been considered. 
The writer feels that the list is far from being a satisfactory one. There are, doubt- 
less, some few journals which have not been included, and there are, doubtless, many 
in the list which can scarcely claim to be educational journals in the proper sense 
of the word, containing, as they do, much matter whieh is not strictly educational 
and nothing of matter which deals with what may be called the politics of education 
or with the principles of education. The list shows, however, that the educated men 
of India are not without their literary ambitions, although they undertake the duties 
connected with such ambitions far too lightly, many of them without the requisite 
qualifications and without a due sense of the responsibilities involved.

CHAPTER VII. 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE TEACHING OF GEOG- 
RAPHY IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 
INTRODUCTION. 
‘The report of the committee of ten on secondary school studies has indicated that 
the study of geography in the schools is the center of all scientific instruction—the 
link, as it were, which connects all branches of science. The definition offered in 
the subreport reads: “The word makes it embrace not only a description of the 
surface of the earth, but also the elements of botany, zoology, astronomy, and mete- 
orology, as well as many considerations pertaining to commerce, government, and 
ethnology. The term‘ physical environments’ of men expresses, as well as any single 
phrase can, the conference’s conception of the principal subject which they wish to 
have taught.” This sentence, and the subsequent explanations which will be found 
in the report mentioned, clearly indicate that geography is vastly different from 
what our fathers and forefathers thought it to be. It is the only branch in the 
curriculum of schools, below the university, which connects the mathematical and 
natural-scientific with historical knowledge, and will always furnish the strongest 
remedy against mental waste. The fact that geography has of late found so much 
attention in educational literature, especially in central Europe, suggests a presen- 
tation of the leading ideas, and enumeration of the more recent inventions, devices, 
and appliances for teaching. This is attempted in the following chapter. 
HISTORICAL SKETCH. 
Itis difficult to state with any degree of certainty at what time geography was 
introduced into the curriculum of schools, to what extent, and in what manner it 
was taught. This much is certain, that geography, as a branch of study, has not 
kept pace with its scientific development. Although geography as ascience was rep- 
resented in ancient times by such noted men as Pytheas, Strabo, Pliny, and Ptolemy, 
and although during the Middle Ages the Moors fostered the study of geography, it 
can not be said that the schools of these periods had given to geography an adequate 
importance. Nor did the vast extension of the geographical horizon at the time of 
the great discoveries, during the fifteenth century, bring it about that geography 
received the attention and respect it deserved as a school study. The great chureh 
reformers in Germany comprehended the value of instruction in knowledge of 
nature, but the intense religious feeling of the time and the renewal of tho study of 
the classical languages prevented a renewal of nature-study—in fact, religion and 
language ruled supreme in the courses of study during the sixteenth century. Of 
the great educators of that period, Sturm, Trotzendorf, and Neander, only the latter 
bestowed any attention upon geography. Neander published a geographical text- 
book in 1583 in Eisleben (Orbis terre partium explicatio). This book still showed 
a complete dependence upon the knowledge of the ancients, and topography is with 
the author simply an enumeration of historical notes, copied more or less exten- 
sively. Nevertheless the work of Neander may be considered a great step in

advance, and up to the year. 1624, when Philipp Cliiver’s geographical works 
appeared, Neander’s books were the only ones used extensively. But the position 
geography held among the branches of study remained a subordinate one; at best, 
it was a supplement to the reading of Roman authors. Not until the one-sided phi- 
lological character of instruction was attacked with success by Bacon and Montaigne, 
and not until Locke and Comenius demanded the consideration of nature-study it 
schools, did geography become a “full-fledged” branch of study. Comenius said: 
“Tnstruction should begin with sense-perception, with observation of real objects; 
from sense-perception real knowledge grows; hence lessons in geography must neces- 
sarily be object lessons at first. It must start from knowledge of home.” 
The leader of the school of pietists, Francke, considered geography in German 
schools a means for training in Christian wisdom, which he placed side by side with 
Christian righteousness, as aims of every education, ‘“‘ because anyone who desires 
to become a sensible man, useful to the Commonwealth, should know the principles 
of astronomy, geography, physics, and history, though he may never enter a higher 
seat of learning.” Palestine and Germany were treated most extensively in the 
Francke schools, ‘‘so that the citizens should be well acquainted with their father- 
Jand, and could study biblical history with the aid of sacred geography.” Generally 
speaking, Francke followed, in the treatment of geography, John Hiibner’s “Brief 
Questions,” which were published in 1693, and for many years were the only geo- 
graphical text-books used in the schools of Germany. Hiibner does not consider 
the natural condition of the country, and merely treats of the political and statistical 
elements of geography. This can not be explained better than by quoting a page 
from Hiibner: 
‘Where is Austria situated ?—Ans. It is situated so that the Danube River flows 
through the center, above are Bohemia and Moravia; to the right is Hungary; to 
the left Salzburg and Bavaria, below Styria. The whole country belongs to the 
Roman Emperor of the German nation; his title is Archduke of Austria. The 
religion throughout is Roman Catholic.—Ques. What do we note in Austria?—Ans. 
Almost in the center of Austria the little river Enns (Latin, Anissus) empties its 
waters into the Danube, and divides the country into two parts. That which lies 
to the right—that is, toward Hungary, is called Nether-Austria, or the country 
below the Enns (Latin, Austria-inferior) ; that which is situated on the left, toward 
Bayaria, is called Upper-Austria, or the land above the Enns (Latin, Austria-supe- 
rior). In Nether-Austria we have to note the following places: First, Vienna (L. 
Vindobona), situated on the Danube, is the capital and residence of the Roman 
Emperor. It is an excellent fortress and the true vanguard of Christendom, haying 
been beleaguered twice by the Turks, in 1529 and 1683, without being captured. The 
city has a bishop, but he is not an independent prince of the realm, and it has an 
ancient university. 2nd. Krems (lL. Cremsa), a fine city situated on the Danube, a 
little to the left. 3rd. Neustadt (L. Nova Stadium) is commonly called a.suburb of 
Vienna, and is situated below Vienna near the Hungarian line, is a brave fortress. 
4th. Kloster-Neuburg (L. Monasterium Neoburgicum), situated not far from Vienna, 
and is the place where his Imperial Majesty performs his devotions. 5th. Laxenburg 
(L. Laxemburgum), and 6th, Ebersdorf (L. Ebersdorffum), are both situated below 
Vienna, and they are places where the imperial court often seeks diversion and 
pleasure. 7th. Schénbrunn, close by Vienna, is an incomparable pleasure-house of 
the present Roman Emperor. “8th. Baden (L. Therma Austriace), is noted for its 
warm springs. 9th. Starenberg (L. Starenberga), the castle and seat of the Staren- 
berg family. 10th. Weitra, a princely possession situated near the Bohemian line, 
belonging to the Fiirstenberg family.” 
Up to the close of the eighteenth century, instruction in geography was conducted 
in the spirit of Hiibner, that is, purely historical and practically political consider- 
ations decided the selection of matter. Then came the great revolution in pedagog- 
ical views, started by Rousseau. It had great influence upon the formation of   
   
      
-P-A-G-E-291
TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 281 
  geographical instruction. Rousseau demanded objective instruction (object lessons), 
saying: ‘‘In every study signs are worthless without the ideas they are to represent. 
Nevertheless the child’s study is confined to signs; it never becomes able to under- 
stand the things themselves. While one endeavors to give him a description of the 
earth, he makes the acquaintance of the map; he learns the names of cities, coun- 
tries, and rivers, of which he has no adequate conception. To the child they are 
nowhere except on paper; it does not see them, or anything that would indicate 
that they are more than words.” 
At another place Rousseau says: ‘‘ That city in which the child lives, the country 
house of his father, should be the first two points of departure in geography; then 
should follow the places lying between them; the rivers in the neighborhood; lastly, 
the position of the sun and the mode of finding one’s way by learning geographical 
directions. * * * The child should make a map of its own, however simple, 
which should contain only two points at first; others to be added as instruction 
proceeds, and as it learns to estimate distances and positions. * * * Generally 
speaking, never place the sign before the thing, unless it is absolutely impossible 
to produce the thing itself so that it be seen; for the sign absorbs the attention of 
the child and causes the thing it represenis to be forgotten. Things! Things! I 
can not often enough repeat that we give too much importance to words; with our 
talkative education we produce prattlers.” 
The fundamental ideas of Rousseau found enthusiastic appreciation in Germany, 
and were practically carried out, at least partly, by the philanthropinists of Dessau 
and Schnepfenthal. The influence of these schools was essentially aided by J. Chris- 
tian Gatterer, who especially emphasized the physical part of geography in his 
Sketch of Geography. Topography had hitherto not been considered. The. prog- 
ress made in the study of geography at the close of the last century was very great, 
and much of what was then demanded by the greatest educators and reformers may 
’ still be demanded to-day. 
Kropatscheck sums up the vital principles of geographical instruction advocated 
one hundred years ago, as follows: ‘‘The one principle is unassailable, namely, that 
geography, among all the branches taught in school, is the one that needs sensuali- 
zation most, hence it is essential to train the pupils in self-seeing, in sense percep- 
tion. This can best be done by beginning the instruction with knowledge of home, 
as Schiitz in Halle does, proceeding from the city to the Saale country and gradually 
extending the outlook upon Germany and Europe. But the instruction must be 
articulated into several grades, for each of which a special book and special maps 
are required. However, the best maps will be useless if the student merely memo- 
rizes and fails to understand the map. The map must not be overcrowded with 
names, but should contain only that which is necessary matter for each grade. It 
must represent the various European countries on precisely the same scale. It would 
be very well if they contained no names at all, not even initials, which would lead 
to mere guessing. Every map must regularly be compared with the globe, so that 
the pupil may be trained in studying it from different points of view, in order to 
firmly impress upon his memory the positions of places, courses of rivers, and eleva- 
tions; a comparison with the globe will also facilitate the estimation of distances. 
If he has thus become familiar with the map picture, he should draw the outlines of 
the country into a network of meridians and parallels. This free-hand drawing of the 
countries should be aided by the now well-known devices of applying geometrical 
figures. In the literature of the period we find very pronounced warnings against 
overdoing the map drawing, for it would easily degenerate into a mere pastime and 
would lead to false representations, since no scholar’s drawing would be as correct 
as the drawing of the printed map.” 
Among the men who worked assiduously in the line Gatterer had pointed out, 
Herder may be mentioned. He had been inspired by Kant, and wrote an admir- 
able address on “ The pleasure, utility, and necessity of geography.” Herder in this
-P-A-G-E-292
  282 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
oration advocated the placing of physical geography in the beginning of all geograph- 
ical instruction; also he emphasized the importance of geography for the other 
seiences, especially history, saying: ‘‘Hoew does it aid a youth if he merely knows 
what has happened and can not locate events? Only through the aid of geography 
willit become clear to him why certain people had to play a réle upon the his- 
toric stage and could play no other; why the sciences, inventions, and arts—indeed 
the whole civilization—took the course it has taken and no other. Geography is the 
basis of history, and history is nothing but the geography of times and nations set 
in motion. He who studies the one without the other will understand neither, and 
he whe despises both should live like the mole, not upon but in the earth. Hence, 
happy is he whose occupation with geography does not merely fill his memory, but 
forms his soul and opens his mind.” At another place Herder says: “The Egyptian 
horse, the Arabian camel, the African lion, the American alligator, etc., are more 
noteworthy symbols and features of some countries than the changeable boundary 
lines which were drawn by a deceptive peace, and which the first war following may 
change agai.” 
The greatest progress, however, was made in geographical science, as well as geo- 
graphical instruction, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, under the 
influence 6f Alexander von Humboldt and Carl Ritter. Humboldt, in the most 
monumental book of the century, his Cosmos, represented the entirety of terres- 
trial natural phenomena as a system of causes and effects based strictly on natural - 
laws. In this he was successful as far as it was possible to be with the mass of 
geographical and physical knowledge accumulated up to the middle of our century. 
Humboldt prepared the first presentation of vertical profiles and most excellent 
maps. He it was who introduced the study of comparative elevations; his mathe- 
matical and hypsometrical data enabled him to furnish the basis for a geography of 
plants; his map of Central Asia gave to the relief of a large continent an entirely 
new formation, one that is adhered to in the main to the present day; together with 
Leopold von Buch, he advanced a new theory of the formation of voleanoes; by 
means of his isotherms he, as it were, compelled nature to reveal the disturbing 
meteorological causes, and this ingenious invention acted not only as a light in the 
field of meteorology, but also helped to illustrate the working of natural forces. He 
has thus explained to us a large number of facts of physical geography. 
Ritter, in building up geography as a science, profited by the enormous forward 
stride the natural sciences had taken through Humboldt. Even before the appear- 
ance of the Cosmos he acknowledged clearly and distinctly the idea whose realiza- 
tion has made his name immortal. This was in 1804 in the preface to his first work 
on Europe. “Geography must be delivered from the spiritless treatment of text- 
book writers, who heap up in a desolate chaos names and numbers; from this deso- 
late heap of useless particles an organic lifelike whole must be developed which 
corresponds to reality; from the tedious, because thoughtless, description of the 
earth must arise a knowledge of the earth, i. e., a science which investigates causal 
connections and enlivens intellect and imagination. Geography must virtually 
become a science.” ‘‘I endeavored,” he said of his juvenile but very important 
first attempt, ‘‘to make geography pragmatic, if I may use that term. The earth 
and its inhabitants have an exact reciprocal effect upon each other; neither of the 
two ean be represented faithfully in its relations without the other. The land 
influences the inhabitants and the inhabitants influence the land.” 
Humboldt and Ritter were true friends who were never envious of each other; 
they worked hand in hand during the forties and fifties in Berlin. They may be 
called the founders of modern scientific geography. Ritter published his investiga- 
tions chiefly in a large work entitled Geography in Its Relation to Nature and the 
History of Mankind. Alas, tho book was never finished. 
“Tf the earth,” said Ritter, ‘‘is not a mere lifeless, dead aggregate of inorganic 
nature, or as Herodotus expresses it, a disk made on a potter’s pallet, but a real and 
peculiarly organized natural body that constantly develops new forms, bearing new

  germs of life for further development in the course of centuries and millenniums— 
then geography assumes the character of a unity through which, as its life principle, 
it becomes a whole and enables us to represent it systematically; not until then 
will geography become a formative science for the human mind, a necessary link in 
the system of sciences.” 
Among the men who promoted Ritter’s ideas the following deserve mention: Berg- 
hans, Roon, Vogel, Daniel, Klocden, Guthe, Piitz, Sydow, Oberliinder, Delitsch, and 
others, but above all Peschel, whose erudition, art of representation, and rare skill 
in teaching exerted great influence upon the geographers of the present day. 
In our days geography, both as a science and asa branch of study in schools, 
receives the attention and promotion it so fully deserves. Noted men are success- 
fully engaged in expressing the ideas of Ritter, and in securing for them an intro- 
duction into German elementary schools. These men are Wagner, Kirchoff, and Egli. 
Herbart’s idea was specially influential in securing for geography an introduction 
into the courses of study of secondary and elementary schools, and in giving it a 
pedagogical value. He said: “ Geography is an associating science, and must make 
use of the opportunities of connecting many branches of knowledge that can not 
stand alone. Without geography all knowledge remains unstable, for historical 
events can not be fixed by positions and distances; without it natural products are 
not traced to their origin, etc.” 
Geographical instruction, at the present time, can draw upon a great mass of 
interesting material. It is the task of the teacher to sift, arrange, and present it in 
accordance with the laws of pedagogy. The rational formation of geographical 
instruction in the sense in which Germans speak of “educative instruction” (that 
is, instruction placed in the service of the training of the will), is still an aim to be 
reached. Hummel and Matzat are doing a great deal in this direction (see Bibli- 
ography at the close of this chapter), Teachers and technical geographers in Ger-, 
many have an organ in which they discuss questions of school geography. This 
organ is Seibert’s Zeitschrift fiir Schulgeographie, which periodical has secured for 
itself an honorable position in modern educational literature. 
GEOGRAPHY IN THE MODERN SCHOOL. 
[By Dr. Edwin Zollinger, Basel, Switzerland, in Zeitschrift fiir Selulgeographie. ] 
If we consider the enormous progress the human mind has made during the last 
decades in all domains of exertion, especially in that of technology, and if we see 
that everything tends toward accomplishing great things with small means, we are 
unconsciously induced to review our own domain, that of education, and ask 
whether we have been keeping pace with the progress of the times and whether 
the greatest possible accomplishments are aimed at by means of the least possible 
exertion on the part of the pupil. The question can scarcely be answered in the 
affirmative; the present time demands peremptorily a reform in education, and par- 
ticularly improvement in method. 
It would be altogether wrong to formulate by means of logical speculation a prin- 
ciple for all the branches of instruction, according to which the matter of instruction 
is to be offered to the juvenile mind. The contents of the different branches are 
different; hence the methods should be different. Only one general requirement 
can be made, and that is, that they all obey the laws of logical thought and judg- 
ment. Hence the attempt to establish a uniform system of instruction and me‘hod 
is to be rejected assomething unscientific. as something resembling the scholasticism 
of the Middle Ages. 
In several branches of study the views have gradually cleared; for instance, sen- 
sualization and the use of experiments have beceme the leading principles in nature 
study. In geography, however, no such wel)-defined method has been agreed upon, 
chiefly, I think, because this study has rarely assumed an independent position; it 
has always been coupled with some othér branch—now with nature study, at other

  284 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
times with history. A natural consequence was that the treatment of these branches 
was transferred to that of geography, although, according to its character, it 
demanded a special method of its own. 
Approaching the question of what position ORD, should occupy in the organ- 
ism of school it seems advisable to first throw a glance upon the growth of geog- 
raphy as a science, for pedagogics and methodology would not be able to give us a 
competent reply. 
I. Antiquity and the Middle Ages produced no men who exclusively devoted them- 
selves to the science of the earth and attempted to develop it methodically. It is 
our nineteenth century which deserves the honor of having done this. As a repre- 
sentative of former centuries, Varenius stands in lonely grandeur as a scientific 
geographer. In the year 1650 he published a remarkable book, which has recently 
received the honor of a modern translation; it was entitled Geographia Generalis. 
In contradistinction to the former cosmographs he did not consider small portions 
of the earth, but the earth as a whole. Two centuries passed before another 
remarkable book on the subject was written. It was done by Alexander von Hum- 
boldt in his Cosmos, after men like Torbern Bergmann, Johann Reinhold Forster, 
and Horace Benedict de Saussure had promoted physical geography considerably. 
In this grand work and in other writings, chiefly in his Views of Nature, which 
were magnificent pen pictures in noble language, Humboldt appeared as a promoter 
of science with an immense success. He became the founder of the geography of 
plants, the first investigator of the earth’s magnetism, and the chief promoter of the 
science of voleanic phenomena. The most important fact for us is that he has 
shown in examples of surpassing beauty and convincing strength the intimate 
relation of the various kingdoms of nature. 
Humboldt was not an academic teacher; in his old age he went to hear lectures on 
geography delivered by Carl Ritter, the same man whom he had befriended with this 
science. While Humboldt spent his entire fortune in extensive journeys in the 
equatorial regions of the new continent, so that in late years he had to accept a pen- 
sion from the King of Prussia, Carl Ritter did not travel, but during his thirty-nine 
years of academic teaching disseminated his ideas and enlisted in their favor a large 
number of scholars and disciples. He was also very fruitful as an author. His 
later masterpiece was: Geography in its Relation to Nature and the History of 
Man, or a General Comparative Geography: A Secure Foundation for the Study 
and Instruction in the Physical and Historical Sciences. Second edition, Berlin, 
1822-1859. The first volume treats of Africa; the following 18 volumes, each num- 
_ bering over 1,000 pages, are devoted to the continent of Asia without exhausting 
the subject. No one before Ritter had attempted to collect the entire knowledge of 
a continent and scientifically present the ‘investigations and observations of others. 
At the close of the first volume Ritter offers a review upon Africa which is charac- 
teristic of his views. We see from this that he designates the continents as ‘the 
great individuals of the earth” who resemble one another in special “family fea- 
tures.” The features of Africa consist in ‘the peculiarity of its coast line having no 
large indentations; * * * in the simplicity of the contrast between high and low 
land; * * * inthe incomplete development of large systems of streams; * * * 
in its position to the course of the sun, by which this continent is divided into two 
almost equal parts with regard to its climatic conditions; * * * in the insignifi- 
cant contrast of its general conditions, and the greater similarity and uniformity of 
the whole.” ‘In this earth individual, which, physically, is less developed than 
others, fewer natural impulses exist for the development of the consciousness of the 
human race; hence the history of the race shows little progress. The color of the 
skin, the physiognomy of the African are both less differentiated and less uniform. 
This fact is in harmony with the physiognomy of the continent, which shows few 
variations in its main forms and parts.” The cumbrous, compact form of Africa, 
Ritter thought, was reflected in the type of the negro, while on the other hand the 
   
-P-A-G-E-295

elegant well-articulated formation of Europe was reflected in the symmetry of the 
Caucasian race and in its high intellectual development. This seems to be a kind of 
geographical science of predestination. | 
This philosophic consideration, this attempt at connecting the nature of a country 
with its history, Carl Ritter calls ‘Comparative geography.” He was still engaged 
in his large work when opposition was offered to his views by Julius Frébel in an 
essay entitled: ‘‘Some remarks concerning the present condition of geography.” 
Frébel said: ‘‘Comparative anatomic investigation searches for relations in the 
structures of a large number of individuals, and attempts to demonstrate similarity 
or dissimilarity, and derives from them general morphologic laws. If we introduce 
the idea of individuality into geography it would be the earth as a whole that would 
have to be called an individual, but never a country, as Ritter claims, however well 
defined it be by natural boundaries or its history, for both are accidental and chang- 
ing. * * * To compare geographically one country with another seems like com- 
paring anatomically an arm with a leg, which, of course, would be interesting enough. 
Laws, however, which have the same value for the science of the earth as for the 
science of the human body derived from a comparison with other animal bodies, 
could be obtained only through comparison of terrestrial nature with a nature of 
some other heavenly body, if this thing were pose b es 
Ritter, in an extensive letter to Berghaus, replied to this attack, but all he said 
amounted toa panegyric on his own method, which had caused a reform in science, and 
was either imitated by a number of learned men or worked out in specialties of 
various kinds. What he said was not a refutation of Frébel’s view. 
Julius Frébel soon emigrated to Switzerland and occupied himself after that more 
with politics than with science; hence the objection raised against Ritter was not 
further emphasized. Ritter received general recognition for his ‘Comparative geog- 
raphy,” and all who had taken up geography from the historical point of view 
accepted his method as the only proper one. This caused a standstill of several 
decades in the methodical development of a science. According to Ritter’s dictum 
that the earth was only a stage for history, his school treated geography merely as 
a basis of history and thus degraded it to be history’s handmaid. But since it was 
acknowledged that knowledge in mathematical and physical geography was desir- 
able, these two branches were given over into the hands of the teachers of mathe- 
matics and natural sciences, and thus the unity of the science was broken up. 
« Oscar Peschel deserves praise for having reestablished the connection of the various 
geographical sciences. Acknowledging the high merits of Carl Ritter, Peschel con- 
cludes ‘that Ritter had never solved a problem of comparative geography. * * * 
He investigated the reflex action of the horizontal and vertical formation of dry land 
upon the course of human culture, a thing that has nothing in common with the 
procedure called ‘comparative geography’ * * *. The problem of the latter 
science consists rather in finding the similarities in nature as the map drawer repre- 
sents them to us.” In this Peschel saved the epithet ‘“‘comparative,” but he con- 
ceived the problem less extensively and profoundly than Ritter. Peschel prepared 
in his acceptation of the word ‘ comparison” so-called geographical homologies— 
Africa, Australia, and South America—Borneo, Celebes, and Djilolo. Peschel’s works 
are written so that the general reader can understand them without special prepara- 
tion. Geography was thereby popularized, but not at all elevated scientifically. 
Peschel confirmed, as it were, the view that geography was a matter of self-evidence, 
a branch which every teacher could teach without special preparation. 
During the seventies an important change took place in the views of the leading 
scholars. A large number of universities established chairs for that branch of study. 
From the death of Carl Ritter, in 1859, till 1872 only three professors, B. G. Mendels- 
sohn, in Bonn, Fr. Symoni, in Vienna, and J. J. Egli, in Ziirich, gave lectures on 
geography. From among the men who, after 1872, devoted their lives to the teach- 
ing of geography, I’. v. Richthofen, Supan, Marthe, and Gerland may be mentioned.  
-P-A-G-E-296
    286 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
They promoted and enriched the science by publications of great value, and especially, 
fostered the teaching. 
From utterances of these men it is plain that the term “‘comparative geography”, 
is not strictly adhered to any longer, partly because the deep philosophical concep- 
tion of Carl Ritter aims more at finding causality than at comparison; partly also, 
because the importance which Oscar Peschel had given to the term ‘‘comparison” 
confines itself to a part of geographical investigations. Modern scientists have 
returned to the technical term ‘‘ geography,” which is not understood to be knowl- 
edge of the earth, but knowledge of the surface of the earth. This defines its limits 
with regard to other sciences, notably geology. 
So, then, geography is to be considered as a science of the surface of the earth and 
the organic beings thereon as well as the formation and configuration of the land- 
scape. Itis claimed that the school method should not only proceed to describe, 
but especially point out, reciprocal relations and dependencies of the various factors. 
The method in geography has, therefore, nothing to do with that of history, but it 
is that of the natural sciences. Indeed, it is in our latter days called a natural 
science, and Gerland, in his attempt at building up the science to a complete unity, 
banished the human element—i. e., the history of man—entirely from the confines of 
geography. No one seems to have followed him to this extreme. On the contrary, 
man and his settlements are now considered as determining agencies that change 
the face of our planet. Not only the civilized nations are drawn into the compass 
of observation, as in the ease of history, but also savage people. Their dependence 
upon the soil is considered in a manner similar to that in which plant families are 
represented biologically. 
Meanwhile, some people desire to see geography occupy a position subordinate to 
that of history. They desire to represent it simply as the stage upon which historice 
events are played. This view necessitates an unequal treatment of the various ¢on- 
tinents, because certain regions which have no historic interest must be neglected. 
Furthermore, such a geography is mainly an enumeration of names and dates; it 
does not appeal to the intellect, but chiefly to the memory, and is therefore to be 
rejected. On the other hand, the philosophic view, according to Ritter, makes too 
great demands upon the intellect and capacity of pupils, and hence must be rejected 
also. 
There is, therefore, nothing left but the third view, which considers geography as 
a natural science. It will not be difficult to support the demands which at the 
present day are mado upon the instruction and the teacher of geography. 
II. Teaching is not a trade. The teacher should not only know and understand 
what he is to present to the pupil, but the interests of freedom and independence in 
the mode of treatment demand that the extent of his knowledge and skill be vastly 
greater. The higher his aims are, the deeper will he have penetrated into the fun- 
damental sciences of his branch. A teacher who, in a middle grade for instance, 
teaches the clements of mineralogy must be expected to have a clear idea of the 
inner structure and chemical combinations of those natural bodies which he has to 
describe and explain. Of a teacher who has to teach geology, even though it be in 
the most elementary form, we presuppose, as a matter of course, that he has studied 
mineralogy. The simple result of this argument is that the geographer must have 
studied geology, for the forms of the earth’s surface and the constant changes going 
on on it are consequences of the combinations of matter and can be understood or 
explained only if the geological formation be understood. 
What structural difference, for instance, exists between the steep-pointed horns of 
the high Alps and the compact, terrace-like knolls of the lower ranges at the foot of 
the Alps? Itis explained by the fact that the peaks consist of homogeneous crys- 
talline rock, while the foothills are built up of sediment deposited in layers by the 
action of water. How different is the landscape around the lakes in northern Italy 
and those in the phlegriiic fields! The former have a foundation of erratic material,
-P-A-G-E-297
TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 287 
  which has round forms enveloped in luxuriant vegetation; in the latter the founda- 
tions are voleanie productions, which were accumulated or heaped up in regular, 
almost mathematical, forms. Can there bo a greater contrast than between the 
Vierwaldstiidter Lake and the lakes in the Albanian Mountains? Tho former lies 
in a system of valleys crossing one another, the latter in the craters of extinct 
voleanoes. 
In describing the flora and fauna of the earth the teacher must be able to enumer- 
ato and describe the various plant and animal families. He would givo himself a 
testimonial of poverty if he were to use names with which he can connect no ideas; 
hence he must have studied botany and zoology atleast in their elementary form. 
In the treatment of anthropographic conditions he need not necessarily be an histo- 
rian, for he deals not with questions of the past but with those of the present. 
Hence it isof great advantage to him to be acquainted with physical anthropology. 
Instruction in geography, then, presupposes knowledge in geology, botany, zoology, 
and mineralogy. We rarely find a historian who understands all these branches, 
because his inclinations and studies have led him into a different direction. If, 
therefore, geography can not be represented by a special teacher, it would be best to 
put it into the hands of the teacher of natural science. Such a combination will 
elevate this branch not only materially, but also formally; for in this case tho purely 
narrative method of the historian is not applied, but the developing method of the 
inductive sciences; geographical facts are not offered to the memory as mere names, 
but as concepts, and things are brought together which are in causal connection, not 
in a purely accidental, such as battles and mountains or heroes and islands. When 
Vesuvius is mentioned, it is not only stated that it buried Pompeii, Herculaneum,” 
and Stabiw, but by the aid of a schematic profile the formation of the mountain and 
its activity will be explained. If, perchance, pieces of lava, bombs, and lapilli are 
shown to the pupil the entire knowledge will form a correct and indelible image in 
the mind, better than can be done by reading long descriptions. 
The terrace landscapes of northern China and the pampas of La Plata owe their 
peculiarity to the soil, the “loess,” a specimen of which material, if picked up near 
Basel, near Aarau, or in the valley of the Rhine, can demonstrate the peculiarities 
of that soil and induce far-reaching geographical conclusions. In studying the 
glaciers the teachers should not neglect to exhibit a small piece of rock, polished or 
scratched by the movement of a glacier, taken from an accumulation of rocks brought 
down by a glacier. If this specimen be found in the neighborhood of the school— 
that is, in a place situated at a great distance from the present glacier—the pupil will 
conélude that glaciers must in prehistoric times have had a much larger extension 
than now. His mind will, by arriving at such a conclusion, not only gain an impres- 
sive fact, but grow in capacity. The various coast lines and their formation, such as 
the Giant’s Causeway, in Ireland, the sandy coast of northern Germany, the Mangrove 
coast of Venezuela, and others, should be shown in pictures which may be used 
profitably to teach the pupils something of the dangerous life of the coast population. 
If there is any part of geographical instruction that profits by the mode of treat- 
ment applied in natural sciences, it ismap drawing. Of the numberless methods: 
advanced, in order to acquaint the pupil with geographical data by means of a draw- 
ing, not one has gained general approbation, because none of them treat nature 
correctly. All do violence to nature in attempting to force it to conform to a pattern. 
Geometrical figures and lines are used within which or around which the coast line 
is drawn; in fact, the map picture becomes a mathematical problem. ‘Those who 
advocate this procedure forget that the configuration of continents is not made on 
geometrical lines; that the surface of the carth is the result of innumerable forces 
and is constantly changing. The earth’s surface has neither straight lines nor plane 
figures, simply because the earth is a sphere. 5 
The study of any continent should begin by pointing out the errors in cartographic 
representation. Notably: Africa, from north to south, measures one-fifth of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-298
288 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  earth’s circumference; the Pacific Ocean, in equatorial direction, measures one-third. 
These facts can be expressed on the plane only by diminishing the dimensions near 
the margin. When the various modes of projection are treated (for instance, Mer- 
cator’s) the distortion of a continent becomes obvious in the comparison of various 
projections. Hence it is a useless, because senseless, demand to require of a pupil 
that he should remember the exact configuration of a continent so that he may draw 
it from memory; senseless, I call it, because there is no faultless model. In a Greek 
ornament the different parts fit together according to given measurements, but not 
in a geographical map. In the latter there is no right or left, or top or bottom side, 
as in any other drawing, but merely the position within the network of meridians 
and parallels. If there is anything to be remembered it should be longitude and 
latitude of certain points, especially the latitude, because on that is dependent the 
temperature and climate. 
Istate again that the map is only a symbol of the earth’s surface, and it is this 
surface that is to be described, not the map. It is best to do this in the manner in 
which any other natural body is described. In teaching botany a plant is not drawn 
in its entirety, but only certain parts which are to be brought to the attention of the 
pupil, either because they can not be observed easily, or because they are of particu- 
lar interest for the comprehension of plant life. Insimilar manner a complete image 
of thie country is to be drawn on the board in a step-by-step procedure. I have found 
it to be useless to draw that which the map represents correctly; but all indistinct 
points and facts must be brought out, as well as those that are of special impor- 
dance; all these must be drawn. ‘To givean instance: How laborious it would be to 
“draw the whole of Italy on the blackboard! How simple, on the other hand, if in 
one lesson the valley of the river Po be drawn; in a following lesson the region 
around Rome, with the Albanian Mountains; then the Gulf of Naples, and in a sub- 
sequent lesson Sicily, with the various neighboring volcanic islands, These details 
ean easily be brought into close organic connection with the aid of the map. 
The third dimension of space especially must be brought to the comprehension of’ 
the pupil by special sketches. A practiced eye can easily see it, but to the pupil the 
flat-surfaced map does not convey a correct idea of the third dimension. Hence, not 
only the ground plan but also vertical cuts and profiles must be sketched. The lat- 
ter will, in the nature of the case, always exhibit exaggeration, but it is extraordi- 
narily instructive to give a profile, for instance, of Sicily in the latitude of Mount 
Bina, or of South America in the latitude of the Aconcagua, in proper relation of 
height and distance, Still better would it be if the sketch were drawn on a curved 
line showing the curve of the surface. It is astonishing to see how insignificant the 
vertical dimension is in comparison with the Honientals 
In opposition to Peschel, who claims that during the geography lesson the ay! 
should be hurried from page to page in his atlas, I am disposed to say that that 
instruction is best in which the atlas is used least, and in which drawing and grad- 
ual development of the subject on the blackboardis resorted to. Like a text-book, 
the atlas has the chief object of affording opportunity for review at home. I should 
consider him a bungler who would during the lesson rely on the text-book or the 
atlas, and require his pupils to use their index finger on the map all the time. An 
independent teacher will instruct with the aid of a large wall map and the black- 
board, at least in higher grades; text-book and atlas he will leave to the pupil’s own 
use. Naturally the pupil should learn to read print, but also to read maps. The 
drawing referred to in the foregoing paragraphs will be specially adapted as an 
jntroduction to the comprehension of printed maps. 
It is readily admitted that drawing is an art which is not at the disposal of every- 
one; but everyone can acquire it to the extent in which it is here required. Of 
course he must be conscious of what should be drawn, and sketches must be prepared. 
at home just as orations are prepared in the solitude of one’s study.

  TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 289 
MODERN METHODS AND DEVICES. 
Prof. John Goodison, of the State normal school of Ypsilanti, Mich., who died 
recently, published not long ago in the Popular Educator a series of articles on the 
subject: “Recent developments of geographical teaching in Europe,” which con- 
tain a number of very valuable suggestions, and are an example of careful, thorough 
research. Upon request, Mrs. Goodison kindly placed these eight articles at the dis- 
posal of the compiler, who takes the liberty of inserting them in this chapter. 
I. Introductory.—In all well-ordered mercantile establishments there oceurs at 
more or less frequent intervals an event known as taking stock. By its means, in 
combination with the usually attendant trial balance, the prudent merchant learns 
his business whereabouts—what items of stock have ii the past proved saleable or 
otherwise, and hence what need retrenching, abandoning, or increasing. He dis- 
covers his business deficiencies, and can determine in what directions he must employ 
his energies to secure further development and improvement. 
So excellent a custom would seem to deserve imitation in the teaching world. It 
would be a commendable and a valuable work to take at suitable intervals an account 
of our pedagogical stock in trade—to learn in what state as to profit or loss our balance 
sheet may stand—to inquire what of our past stock of methods and material is dead 
stock to be discarded, and what has proved of real value and in what direction we 
are to look and labor for additions and improvements. 
It is the purpose of these articles to attempt such a stock taking in regard to the 
“subject of teaching geography, and, more especially, to give an account of the work 
done in this direction in Europe during the last decade. 
It_is probable that not many people know what was the state of geographical 
teaching in our schools some twenty-five years ago. Its subject-matter was a dry, 
meaningless, unrelated mass of names and locations, pieced out here arid there with 
vague statements about products, etc., with some scraps of history thrown in with 
the charitable purpose of making the geography lesson interesting—a common 
expression at the time. The method was mainly pointing out and naming bays, 
capes, mountains, cities, etc., upon an outline map—itself a particolored affair, 
- guiltless, save for a little mountain shading, of any attempt to express physical 
features. 
I can well remember a geography recitation to which I listened when visiting the 
Michigan State normal school as an intending student. Upon the wall in front of 
the class hung a large outline map—Pelton’s—upon which the mountains were 
drawn as single peaks arranged in a continuous line. Each member of the class in 
turn advancing to the map pointed out and named five places. I much admired 
the readiness and certainty with which one young man recited—an admiration 
which ceased, however, when I learned his method. These outline maps had num- 
bers attached to the various features they contained and corresponding to the names 
given inakey. The pupilwas supposed to study the lesson for the day in his atlas, 
aided by a manual of ‘Local geography.” But my friend was the happy possessor 
of a “key” and merely memorized the names with their corresponding numbers, 
never troubling himself to look out anything in his atlas. At recitation he merely 
looked for the numbers with which he had associated the names. I think perhaps 
he knew as much about geography as the rest of the class, for their knowledge was 
merely of the map and not of the things represented on the map—a so-called “ Local 
geography.” But of the great physical facts of the earth’s structure, of the relation 
of contour and reliefs to hydrography, to climate, to organic life, and to man’s social 
and historical development nothing whatever was learned. ‘The first effort to remedy 
this state of things was made by Cornelius 8. Carteé, principal of the Harvard 
school, Charlestown, Mass. His physical geography and the accompanying atlas 
were models in every respect. The time, however, had not yet come for a new 
departure, and the excellent work had but little cireulation. The harvest was 
reaped later by Colton, Fitch, Warren, and others, whose “Physical geographies” 
were a sign that teachers were awakening to a consciousness that the study of geog- 
raphy was more than a matter of names and locations. Great, however, as was the 
advance indicated by the appearance of these works, they still, to a large extent, 
represented the prevalent idea that in the lower grades. the teacher’s work should 
be restricted to local geography. Physical geography was regarded as a high- 
school study. A conception of the unity of the subject had not yet been reached, 
and these works consisted mainly of brief separate treatises upon the sciences which 
geography must necessarily call to her aid. The earth was almost lost sight of in 
the mass of details drawn from many sciences, but of the “ Erdkunde” of Ritter 
and Humboldt there seemed to be no conception. Most of these books closed with 
a ‘Physical geography of the United States,” and it is somewhat surprising that 
not one of the skillful writers followed out this idea, giving a physical geography o£ 
the oceans and continents on the same lines,

  290 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
The realization of this idea—the presentation to the teaching world of the concept 
of geography one science dealing with the earth as its subject-matter and recogniz- 
ing a casual relation between all classes of geographical facts—was to come from 
another hand. Arnold Guyot, trained in the school of Ritter and Humboldt, brought 
tous the results of the European in favor of better geographical teaching. Previous 
to the advent of Carl Ritter, geography had occupied but a subordinate place in the 
schools. It was regarded as the handmaid of history and other sciences—merely a 
convenient register of the locations of places and an aid to readily finding them 
when wanted. In 1804 Carl Ritter, who had been educated at Salzmann’s Institute, 
in Schnepfenthal, and later had spent some time with Pestalozzi, published the first 
volume of his Europa. In the preface he says: ‘My first aim is to give the reader 
a vivid picture of the entire land, of its products of nature and art, of the world of 
man and of nature, and to so present this as a connected whole that the most important 
results concerning nature and man will develop themselves through reciprocal com- 
parison. * * * Theearthand its inhabitants stand in the closest interconnection, 
and one can not be presented in all its relations without the other. Hence history 
and geography must ever remain inseparable companions. The land works upon the 
people, the people upon the land.” In 1804-1806 he issued from the press of the 
Schnepfenthal Institute his Sechs Karten von Europa, with explanatory text. Iam 
the fortunate possessor of a copy of the second edition (1820), discovered by accident 
in a box of old maps, ete., in Siemon & Bros.’ bookstore, Fort Wayne, Ind. Of the 
six maps, the first presents the distribution of cultivated plants in Europe; the second, 
the distribution of forest trees, shrubs, ete. ; the third, of wild and domestic animals ; 
the fourth, the chief mountain chains of Europe; the fifth is a profile representing 
the leading elevations, with regions of vegetation, etc., compared with the equatorial 
Cordillera; the sixth shows the density of population, distribution of various races, 
ete. An extra map, as frontispiece, is an attempt to delineate Europe bas-relief. 
In 1829 Denaix published an edition of this work at Paris under the title Atlas 
Physique del’Europe. It will be observed that this epoch-making book laid down the 
lines upon which most work of the kind has since been done. in July, 1806, Ritter 
published in Guts-Muths’ Zeitschrift fiir Piidagogik an essay of 20 pages, ‘‘ Einige 
Bemerkungen iiber den methodischen Unterricht in der Geographie.” In this essay 
Ritter describes the aim of geography to be ‘to make man acquainted with the scene 
of his labors in special and in general; hence it is a description not merely of the 
earth itself, but of the earth in relation to man. It is the bond of union between 
the world of nature and the word of man, inseparable from each, since it is the funda- 
mental, necessary condition for the characterization of both.” After enumerating 
the different classes of facts that constitute geography, he says: “The natural 
method is that which knows how to unite these different objects to a whole, which 
also, in harmony with the nature of the object, passes from the special to the general. 
Tt is that method which makes the child in the first place at home amid the realities 
that surround him and teaches him to see in the place of his abode.” 
Trained in this school, founded by Ritter and developed by Berghaus, Schouw, 
yon Rougemont, von Roon, Ludde, and others, Guyot gave us, first-in his Earth 
and Man and later in his geographies and wall maps, the results of the labors of 
European geographers joined to those of his own original and active mind. His 
wall maps and the maps of his text-books were (with the exception previously noted) 
the first to represent the earth’s surface as it is. To-day the wall maps are unex- 
celled as a foundation for class instruction and the practice of map reading. Guyot’s 
works were, in fact, the outcome of just such a stock taking of progress in geograph- 
ical method antecedent to their days as the present series of papers propose to 
attempt for a later period. 
It will be obvious that naturally the topics to be treated would fall under two 
divisions—such as relate to the subject-matter of geography as school science and 
sueh as relate to methods of teaching in the narrower sense. Butit is impossible to 
draw a hard and fast line between such closely allied topics, and the discussion of 
one will often lead to incursions into the domain of the other. The chief subjects 
presented will be: Home geography (Heimatkunde), use of the wall map, map read- 
ing, representation (map drawing, reliefs, ete.), distribution of topics into courses, 
commercial geography, anthropography, means of illustration, onomatology, geo- 
graphical museums, geographical chairs in universities. 
If. Home geography (Heimatkunde).—That the study of geography should begin 
with the pupil’s home is an educational commonplace oftener assented to than acted 
upon. In Germany, Austria, and Switzerland home geography receives a large share 
ot the attention of teachers, and the ays, pamphlets, and books discussing its 
methods and details would form a small library. Ritter laid the foundations of 
home geography when, as quoted in the preceding paper, he said: ‘The natural 
method is that * * * which makes the child in the first place at home amid the 
realitics that surround his abole.” ‘The first efforts to carry out the idea were prob- 
ably made in Pestalozzi’s-school at Yverdun. J. W. Henning, one of Pestalozzi’s 
assistants, in his Uber dic Methode beim geographischen Unterrichte, Iferten, 1812, '   
       
      
     
   
      
-P-A-G-E-301
  TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 294 
a work in which he probably had the assistance of Ritter, lays down four courses of 
eographical instruction. He describes the first or elementary course as ‘‘a complete 
nowledge of the neighborhood,” in which the pupil should lay the foundations for 
his future study of physical, political, and mathematical geography, and prescribes 
excursions in field and forest as the method of teaching. Later writers, as Wilhelmi_ 
in his Ideen ueber Geographie, Lohse in his Der methodische Unterricht in der Geo- 
graphie, Ziemann in his Der geographische Unterricht, and others, further developed 
the subject. But as the scientific concept of geography was then in its infancy, 
this earlier work in home geography naturally took a purely topographical direction, 
and after a few lessons on cardinal points, etc., proceeded at once to study the 
neighborhood as a political division. 
The book that first worked out a course of home geography in harmony with the 
modern idea of geography was F. A. Finger’s Anweisung zum Unterrichte in der 
Heimatskunde. First published in 1844, it appeared in a sixth edition in 1887, For 
Finger home geography is a preparation for the study of the earth. The “home” is the 
region that we can see, travel over on foot; the mountains, woods, and brooks that sur- 
round us; the clouds, sun, and stars of the heavens above us. “We donot make politi- 
cal divisions our limit; * * * that would be an unnatural restriction.” Finger 
bases his lessons on Weinheim, which is in Baden, but on the border looking into the 
beautiful Birkenau Valley, whichis Hessian. ‘If the pupils point outto me the lovely 
beech forest northeast from Wagenberge, shall I say, ‘Stop, children; that is Hes- 
sian’?” In answer to the question, What features of the home shall be studied? 
Finger replies that home geography is a preparation for the study of geography 
proper, and should consider such topics as will reappear in that study. ‘‘ What does 
geography teach? Geography makes the pupils acquainted with the earth; it 
teaches its. size and form; its motions on its own axis and around the sun; * * * 
it teaches the distribution of land and water; it shows the separation into conti- 
nents and oceans; it considers the position, size, boundaries, surface, climate, pro- 
ductions, inhabitants, etc., of each land. * * * As aids, geography uses globes 
and maps, representations of things, not the things themselves; it also draws maps.” 
All these topics have, as Finger shows, their type in the home. The following par- 
tial synopsis of the lessons in his “First step” for children between the ages of 6 
and 8 will show how he works out this principle: 
Schoolroom; things in the schoolroom; before, behind, right, left, above, below; 
first exercise in drawing (plan of schoolroom, of room at home); the sun and moon; 
rain, hail, thunder, lightning; garden; sunset; clouds; rainbow; shadows; school- 
house; the sun moves to the right hand; the moon moves to the right hand; south; 
west; east; north; spring; southeast; stars, snow, icc, short days, winter; occupa- 
tions of men, etc. 
The second step reviews and expands these topics, adding new ones, such as rain- 
bow, aurora, seasons, storms, and extends the map drawing beyond the school limits 
into the town. Finger points out that as soon as home geography has accomplished 
its end of laying the foundation for later study of geography and training to the use 
of maps, ctc., its usefulness ceases. Its value lies in the fact that its subject-matter 
can be directly observed, described, and represented by the pupils. Any attempt to 
extend the course beyond what the pupil can see is a violation of the principles upon 
which home geography depends. Hence Finger protests against passing from the 
home to county, county to state (or their German equivalents), state to native land, 
and so on to the earth. ‘When home geography is completed, and before studying 
single countries, we pass to the earth as a whole.” This view of Finger’s was shared 
by Henning, who declares it to be absurd, almost impossible, and at variance with 
the order of development of the human mind and the nature of geography, “to lead 
the child from his birthplace as center in continually widening circles to a conscious- 
ness and building up of the idea of the earth.” 
Finger’s Anweisung has a worthy companion in Matzat’s Mcthodik des geographi- 
schen Unterrichts, published in 1885. This work covers the entire field of geograph- 
ical teaching, and I shall have occasion to speak of it fully hereafter. It comprises 
two parts, an analytic anda synthetic. The analytic section lays down the princi- 
ples of geographical method and consists of an empirical and a theoretical part. It 
will be readily seen that Matzat has a philosophical head. He belongs to the school 
of Herbart and Ziller, and though the first part of his book is by no means easy 
reading, it will repay any effort it may cost. In the synthetic division he marks out 
a complete geographical course, giving the lessons for each day of the year. The 
first thirty-eight lessons are given to home geography. _Matzat makes a (to my mind) 
well-grounded distinction between home knowledge and geographical home knowl- 
edge (Heimatkunde und geographische Heimatkunde). His order of lesson is as 
‘ollows: 
Heaven and earth; horizon; vertical and horizontal; plan of schoolroom, 1:100° 
(metric measures) ; cardinal points; plan of school building and neighborhood, 1:1000 
(metric measures); reduction of this plan to 1:10,000; measuring angles; plan of    
   
    
 
-P-A-G-E-302
292 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  school grounds, 1:10,000 (pace measures); elevations; profile of the school grounds, 
1:10,000; representation of relief on the principle the steeper the darker the shading ; 
reduction of plan to 1:100,000; map of neighborhood of school grounds, 1:1,000,000; 
relief model of neighborhood of school grounds; first wall map of neighborhood of 
school grounds; relief expressed by shading as above; movement of the sun from 
beginning of May to end of September; second wall map of neighborhood of school 
pena De, colored in flat tints, the higher the darker; profile through the neighbor- 
ood, 1:100,000. 
It will be noticed that Matzat first develops the idea of the horizon as the visible 
limit of home geography, and then proceeds from the schoolhouse as center of horizon 
to study the neighborhood. This was the method of Dr. Friederich Kapp, as 
developed in his Zeichnende Erdkunde (Minden, 1837); the present writer has 
employed it for many years and finds it more satisfactory than any other. Matzat 
differs from Finger in following home geography by a study of the native country, 
combined with lessons on the constellations, further movements of the sun, etc.; 
then Germany, Europe, the earth as a sphere, the continents and the oceans, with 
lessons on equinox, solstice, day, hour, year, calendar, moon, pole, meridian, ete. 
This is partly due to the fact that in the school of which Matzat is principal the 
course in geography runs parallel with a course in history, the latter commencing 
with Germany. 
E. Gépfert (Ueber den Unterricht in der Heimatskunde) proposes three successive 
courses in home geography: The first has for its object to obtain a geographical pic- 
ture of the home as to position, size, relief, etc.; the second employs itself in com- 
paring and grouping the facts already acquired; the third consists in a systematic 
study ot the home in all its geographical features. Each of these courses would in 
turn form the introduction to a corresponding course in geography proper. In each 
the passage would be from the home directly to the earth as a whole. In the words 
of Gipfert, ‘‘ With the ending of the course in home geography we step beyond the 
limits of sense apprehension and resort to representations, and among these the 
globe is undoubtedly the easiest to understand.” 
Ihave tried, in discussing the three works named above, to give some idea of the 
importance attached by European teachers of geography to home geography as a 
foundation for systematic geography and to indicate the general character of the 
work. As wasremarked in the beginning, the literature of this subject would form 
a library in itself. Tho views set forth by advocates of the study of home ‘geography 
may be summarized as follows: > 
1. In the terrestrial and celestial phenomena of the home region, types and analo- 
gies are to be sought for all the concepts that will be met with in advanced geo- 
graphical study. 
2. Hence -the limits of home geography are determined by these prospective 
requirements of future work. As these include the relations of the earth to the 
sun, etc. (mathematical geography, so called), form, relief, hydrography, and other 
features of physical structure, organic life, man, etc., all these must find their 
beginnings and fundamental concepts in home geography. 
3. The study of the geographical aspects of the home is obviously primarily a 
study of its physical features; hence to proceed by political divisions, township, 
county, etc., is to violate the fundamental idea of home geography. 
4, A leading purpose of home geography is to train the pupil to map reading by 
establishing a relation between geographical elements and their representation. 
5. Each grade of geographical teaching (primary, grammar, high-school) should 
have its preparatory course in home geography. 
6. Home geography once completed, the next step is to the globe as a representa- 
tion of the earth. When the limits of the pupil’s field of observation is reached, 
the work of home geography is completed. 
7. The order of teaching may be stated as follows: First, the pupil is led to observe 
the geographical fact. Second, he is Jed to describe it. Third, he is taught to rep- 
resent it. This order is true of all geographical work, and is not restricted to home 
geography. 
Notre.—German spelling varies between ‘‘ Heimatskunde” and ‘‘Heimatkunde”— 
the latter is the more modern form, but in quoting titles I have always used the 
author’s spelling. Strictly speaking, ‘‘ Heimatkunde” means home knowledge, but 
is interpreted by the majority to mean home geography. Some writers, however, 
give it the broader signification, and include all the facts of the home in their les- 
sons. Hence the distinction quoted above from Matzat between a general home 
knowledge, including all facts of the home, zoological, botanical, historical, etc., 
and a geographical home knowledge forming a special preparation for future geo- 
graphical work. In this case gencral home knowledge would be the work of the first 
and second school years. Geographical home knowledge would commence in the 
third school year. The question whether work in home geography should begin
-P-A-G-E-303
TEACHING. OF GEOGRAPHY IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 293 
  in the first or in the third school year, often quite sharply discussed, is really a 
question of the meaning attached to the word. 
ITI. The wall map as the foundation of geographical teaching.—The pupil, having 
completed his course in home geography, is assumed to have acquired the power to 
read maps. Hence the success of his after course depends mainly upon the thorough- 
ness of this elementary work. He has passed beyond the limits of direct personal 
observation and must henceforth depend upon the observations of others, recorded in 
maps and books, to increase his stock of knowledge. Since all classes of geographi- 
cal facts can be represented on maps, and since one map may record the results 
reached by many explorers and investigators, it follows that the study of the map 
must occupy a chief place in geographical teaching. This is a point repeatedly 
insisted upon by German and Swiss writers upon methods in geography. Expres- 
sions such as the following are of frequent occurrence: * 
“The map, the truest representation of the earth’s surface, in which explorers 
have recorded their experiences, is the chief means of geographical instruction.” 
“We must see to it that the pupil gives his interpretation to the cartographic 
signs; that he reads into and outof the map the correct geographical relations. Map 
‘reading is the foundation of geographical instruction -in the second grade of work. 
It was prepared for in the first grade (home geography); here it will be broadened 
and deepened.” 
An excellent little manual (Ptaschnik’s Leitfaden beim Lesen der geografischen 
Karten) recognizes this idea in its title, and Geister’s Atlas fiir die Heimatskunde 
der Schweiz is an example of its complete realization. In its twelve maps the pupils 
of the Swiss schools can read an answer to any question respecting their native 
land. i 
Good instruction in geography from this point of view will not consist in looking 
up answers to “‘map questions ””—in memorizing a mass of descriptive text, in point- 
ing out places upon a so-called ‘outline map”—but ina well-ordered reading from 
the map under the teacher’s guidance, and in after work in fixing and defining the 
knowledge thus obtained. Such a course implies the use of two kinds of maps— 
the wall map, from which, with the teacher’s help, the pupil reads the main points 
of his lesson; the hand map of his atlas or geography, in which he reviews and 
makes his own the ideas presented in the lesson. It further implies the division of 
the lesson hour into two parts—the first half devoted to a reproduction of the lesson 
of the preceding day, the second half to teaching a new lesson. ‘These lessons are 
not assigned; they are taught; and the pupil carries away from the classroom an 
imperishable geographical picture of the region studied—a picture which he has 
himself read from the map, and to enlarge and complete which he needs only more 
complete maps. The wall map, then, is the foundation of geographical teaching, 
the hand map its adjunct. The class work is centered upon the wall map, the 
pupil’s individual work upon the hand map. 
In the paper on home geography it was stated that there aro threo steps in each 
lesson in geography—observation, description, and representation—and that this 
order of teaching is not confined to the workin home geography, but applies to every 
grade. It will be readily seen that the wall map takes the place of the home as a 
field of observation; that in both cases the pupil describes what he has observed and 
in like manner represents it. Of this last in connection with reading from the wall 
map Ishall have something to say ina future article, and will at present attend exclu- 
sively to the work of observing and describing. This will be best understood from 
an actual example, which, however, will mainly show the results rather than the 
process of map reading. Intelligent teachers will readily understand that nothing 
is to be told the pupil which he can see for himself, and that, while at first he may be 
assisted in the verbal expression of the results, he must be gradually trained to self 
dependence in this matter. 
Let us suppose that the lesson is the relief map of continental Europe. In some 
previous lesson the pupil has read from the wall map the triangular form of the con- 
tinental mass of Europe and has noted its west, cast, southwest, and southeast angles. 
It is to the relief of this continental triangle that his attention is now directed. 
Something like the following will be the result—it being assumed that the pupil 
understands the way in which highlands, lowlands, etc., are represented on the map: 
Tracner. Look at the map and tell me in what part of continental Europe you 
find the lowland represented, in what part the highland. 
Port. The lowland is in the northeast. The highland is in the southwest. 
T. Look at the map again and tell me if it is all lowland in the northeast, 
P. Some small highlands are represented there. 
T. Is the southwest all highlands? 
P. There are some small lowlands in different parts of the highlands, 
T. State what you have learned from the map. 
P. Northeast continental Europe is mostly lowland. Southeast continental Europe 
is mostly highland. 
 
-P-A-G-E-304
    294 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
T. In what direction must I draw a line to separate the lowland from the 
highland? 
P, From northwest to southeast. 
T. Someone may point to the northwest part of the highland. What river has 
its mouth just above it? 
P. The Rhine. 
T. Someone may point to the southeast part of the highland. What river’s mouth 
just above it? 
P. The Danube. 
‘T. Between what points, then, may my line dividing the lowland from the highland 
extend? 
P. From the mouth of the Rhine River southeast to the mouth of the Danube 
River. 
T. This line is called the mountain diagonal of Europe. You may state how the 
lowland part of continental Europe is divided from the highland part. 
P. Lowland continental Europe is separated from highland continental Europe 
by the mountain diagonal, a line drawn from the mouth of the Rhine River to the 
mouth of the Danube River. Northeast of this line the surface is mostly lowland; 
southwest mostly highland. 
T. We will now attend to the highland part of continental Europe. In what 
direction must I draw a line from the northwest end of the mountain diagonal to 
clear the highland on its west side? 
P. Southwest. 
T. In what direction to reach the southeast end of the mountain diagonal? 
P. East. 
T. What, then, is the form of highland continental Europe? What are its bound- 
ing lines? 
P. Highland continental Europe has the form of a triangle, its bounding lines 
being the mountain diagonal on the northeast side, a line drawn southwest from the 
Rhine River mouth on the northwest side, and a line drawn east to the Danube River 
mouth on the south side. 
T. Look at the map and tell me which part of the highland is the highest. 
P- The south. 
T. Of what does this highest part consist? 
P. Mountain chains. 
T. What name do you give to several mountain chains extending in one general 
direction? 
P. A mountain system. 
T. This mountain system is called the Alps. You may state what you have learned 
about the south part of the highland. 
P. The highest part of the ‘highland of continental Europe is in the south. It 
consists of many mountain chains forming the mountain system of the Alps. 
T. Look at the map and tell me how you see the rest of the highland represented. 
P. Broad spaces bounded by mountain chains. 
T. These broad spaces are plateaus and elevated river basins. How do they com- 
pare with the Alps as to height? 
P. ‘They are lower. 
T. In what direction do they lie from the Alps? 
P. West, north, and east. 
T. You told me that there were several small lowlands in different parts of the 
highland. See if there are any of these between the Alps and the plateaus and river 
basins and to what rivers they belong. 
P. There is one southwest of the “Alps and another in the east. The southwest 
lowland belongs to the Rhine, the east lowland to the Danube. 
T. Look at the plateau region north of the central part of the Alps and see whether 
it is joined to or separated from them. 
P. Itis joined to the Alps. 
T. This region of plateaus, elevated river basins, and mountains is called the 
middle mountain and plateau system of Europe. The word “middle” has reference 
to its elevation, which is not so high as the Alps and not so low as some other moun- 
tains, ete., of continental Europe which lie outside this region. You may state 
what you have learned about this part of the highland. 
P. A region of plateaus, elevated river basins, and mountains lies west, north, and 
east of the Alps. It is called the middle mountain and plateau system of Europe. 
It is separated from the Alps in the west by the valley of the Rhone River, in the 
east by the valley of the Danube River, and is joined to the Alps in the center on 
their north side. 
This may suffice as an example of the method pursued. The next step would be 
amore detailed study first of the Alps and then of the plateau region—the amount  
-P-A-G-E-305

of detail and the method of presentation being governed by the grade of pupils 
instructed. A summary of the results of an exercise in reading the contour of Far- 
ther India will furnish an example of more spe zed work. It is taken from an 
article by Director Heiland, of the Weimar Seminary: 
“Farther India has the form of a triangle; its base line is the Tropic of Cancer, 
between 90° and 110° east longitude from Greenwich, or between the Ganges— 
Brahmaputra Delta and the meridian of Hainan Island. The vertex is Cape Buro 
in 14° north latitude, on the same meridian as Cape Tcheljnskin, the northernmost 
point of Asia. Base is to height as 3 to4. Length from north to south is 2349 —1}° 
x 60 (geographical miles). Length of base is 110° —80° x 55 (geographical miles). 
Direction of west coast is from northwest to southeast, interrupted by the Gulf of 
Martalan. It has three natural divisions: (1) from Brahmaputra-Ganges Delta to 
the Irrawaddi; (2) to the angle of Malacca; (3) to Cape Buro. Direction of 1 and 3 
west-northwest to south-southeast—of 2 north to south. Lengths equal.” 
The reader must bear in mind that each of these examples is taken from parts of 
a course that imply much previous work upon other countries and instruction in 
terminology, modes of representation upon the wall map, ete.- Further, this work 
in reading and describing would be accompanied by corresponding work in repre- 
senting both by teacher and pupil—omitted here, since it will be fully treated in a 
special article. : 
Such work implies good wall maps. Good wall maps arc maps that represent the 
surface of a country as it is—its highlands and lowlands, plateaus, mountains, ete. 
Maps giving political divisions only, with a few indications of mountain chains but 
with no delineation of highlands and lowlands, are absolutely worthless for any 
intelligent work in geography. When the pupil was working in home geography 
he saw before him a collection of natural features, elevations and depressions— 
plains, hills, and valleys. He first of all studied the physical features of his home 
and traced the political divisions within the lines given by these physical features. 
Why, when he comes to study the map as a means of acquiring geographical knowl- 
edge, should this be reversed ? 
‘The writer pursues the course above described in his classes in the Michigan State 
normal school. Every topic—climate, vegetation, commercial relations—is studied in 
the same way, the basis being the exeellent wall maps of Professor Guyot, supple- 
mented by Von Haardt’s Karte der Alpen and similar aids. -He hopes at some future 
time te add to his tools the wall relief maps now used in some of the best European 
schools, of which more in a future article on relief work. He would not willingly 
adopt any other method of teaching geography than the method of map reading from 
the wallmap. I can not close this article better than in the words of Director Hei- 
land, whose lesson on Farther India was quoted above: 
“The wall map is the foundation of the work. This place belongs to it as the rela- 
tively best means of geographicalinstruction. This corresponds to what is the estab- 
lished method in instruction in home geography, in natural science, in drawing. Cer- 
tain fundamental geographical concepts can be formed only by a direct study of the 
map. The wall map should further form the foundation of this work because the 
self-activity of the pupil is thereby most surely promoted. Only when map reading 
forms the beginning and center of the study of country, and when the pupil by the 
exercise of his own powers masters the material presented in the map, can this be 
reached, But it must not be forgotten that where previous instruction in home 
geography has not made the pupil skilled in understanding the symbols of a map 
and has not established a close and living relation between the representation and 
the object represented, geographical teaching plays on an instrument without 
strings.” 
iv" Map reading.—One of the most prominent features in recent European discus- 
sions of geographical methods is an insistance upon the importance of map reading 
as the foundation of all good werk in teaching geography. This topic has already 
been touched upon in the papers on home geography and use of the wall map, but 
its great importance will perhaps warrant a more detailed treatment. The principle 
of map reading is invelved in Froebel’s statement that man develops himself by 
making the external internal and the internal exicrnal. The pupil in the study of 
home geography has made the characteristics of the external features of his neigh- 
borhood the basis for mental pictures of them, and has associated with these internal 
coneepts the mode of representing them. He must now reverse the process, must 
read into the wall and the hand map these concepts, and by describing and repre- 
senting what he finds there delineated give them external presentation. ‘ Knowl- 
edge of the map,” says an anonymous writer in a German educational journal, ‘is 
the most important thing in geographical teaching. Hence systematic map reading 
must be pursued from the very beginning. * * * The pupil should study the map 
intelligently and should translate its signs into the forms for which they stand, so 
that the map will, as it were, describe to him and paint for him vivid pictures of   
   
    
       
   
 
-P-A-G-E-306
296 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  the earth. The map is an unknown region of the carth in which the pupil makes 
discoveries. In spirit he takes ship and traverses the oceans; he lands and explores 
the continents; discovers the bays, peninsulas, islands; crosses plains and deserts; 
climbs the mountains, and penetrates their passes and valleys.” 
So H. Funk, in his Ueber die Anschaulichkeit des geographischen Unterrichtes mit 
besonderer Beriicksichtigung des Kartenlesens, says: ‘‘‘The teacher must lase his 
instruction upon the map. _ Whatever the pupil can find for himself by attentive 
consideration of the map should not be told him.” J.8. Gerster, in his Geographie 
der Gegenwart, says: ‘‘Geographical instruction has especially to provide for devel- 
oping the self-activity of the pupil. This is accomplished by diligent map reading 
on the pupil’s part. Let the teacher dispense with the text-book, rely wholly upon 
the map, and lead the pupil to discover the fundamental physical features of each 
country for himself. Such a course habituates the pupil to independent research and 
compels him always to think while studying the map.” 
Prof. H. Wagner, in his address before the second German Geographical Congress, 
declared that “the intensive study of the map is the central point of all geographical 
teachings.” KE. H. Oberliinder, of the Grimma Teachers’ Seminary, in his Der _geo- 
graphische Unterricht nach den Grundsiitzen der Ritter’schen Schule, writes: “What 
tho pupil can himself read from the map and what he can infer from a study of it 
the teacher should not tell him. He must rather by his questions lead the pupil to 
express his knowledge. Through analytical questions the teacher must guide the 
pupil to describe, upon the basis of the map, the horizontal and the vertical forms 
of a land, its hydrography and its topography. Through developing questions he 
should lead him to determine the climate, productions, etc., as a result of the natu- 
ral features.” Matzat,in a passage too long for quotation, says in substance that 
the study of regions outside the home begins when the pupil has acquired the power 
toreadmaps. The process consists in the pupil’s studying the geographical objects 
on wall and hand map and framing his own descriptions of them. | The description 
is at first guided by the teacher's questions, but as the pupil learns the what and 
the howof map reading he must be required to work more and more independently. 
The verbal expression is a sign for the teacher that the pupil has the geographical 
concept in his mind, a still further and more positive proof being the power to rep- 
resent what has been observed and described. 
It has been my aim in the foregoing quotations to indicate the lines upon which 
good work in map reading must proceed. An attempt will now be made to apply 
these ideas to a concrete example—North America. It is premised that a good wall 
map hangs in view of the class, a map which by either drawing or coloring shows 
not only topography and hydrography but also the distribution of highlands and 
lowlands, and the altitude and character of mountains. Any map that does not do 
this has no place in the schoolroom. It may have its uses as a reference map for 
ascertaining the location of towns, boundaries, railroads, etc., but as a foundation 
for the study of geography it isnot merely valucless—it is positively injurious. The 
pupils have before them the corresponding hand map of th: tlases or geographies. 
‘These equally with the wall map should show the physical features. German and 
Swiss school children have an advantage over their American compeers in the fact 
that not only do good atlases published independently from text-books abound, but 
the maps composing them can be separately purchased; hence, the best map for the 
purpose in view can always be used. Guyot’s may be cited as fulfilling the require- 
ments of a good wail map; Appleton’s and the Eclectic, among others, of good hand 
maps. Under the conditions stated let us proceed to read the map of North America, 
1. Explanation of map.—What it represents. Origin of name America. Why 
North America? (Refer to globe, which should be present at every lesson, for answer 
to this question and the two following:) In which hemisphere, reckoned from the 
equator? In which from meridian of Ferro? 
2. Projection lines.—In what direction do the parallels of latitude curve? How, 
then, must east and west be determined? Find meridian of 97° west from Greenwich 
or 20° west from Washington. In what direction doesitextend? In what direction 
the meridian west of it? East of it? What rule must we observe in judging of 
directions north, south? What angie does the meridian of 97° west from Greenwich 
make with the parallels of latitude? Why are the parallels drawn in curved lines? 
8. Position.—(a) Relative position. Position of home found on map of North 
America and on globe. Pupils mark this position with a small cross upon their hand 
maps. Find the most northern point of North America. How far from the home? 
Measure with scale of miles. How many degrees between the home and this point? 
Proceed similarly with south, west, and east points of North America. 
(b) Absolute position.—Latitude and longitude of north point of North Arerica 
(Boothia Peninsula). What parallel runs south of it (70° N.)? What parallel 
north of it (80° N.)? Take the space between 70° N. and north point of Boothia 
with dividers or on a strip of paper and see how many times it is contained between   
     
   
-P-A-G-E-307
  TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 297 
70° N. and 80° N, (about five times). How many degrees, then, is north point of 
Boothia north of parallel of 70° N.? (Two degrees.) What, then, is the latitude of 
the most northern point of North America? (72° N.Lat.) Proceed similarly with 
longitude. Repeat with south, west, and east points of North America. 
4, Boundaries.—This needs no illustration. 
5. Coast line.—Find the strait that joins the Arctic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. 
Name? Find the most easterly point of North America. Name? Direction of coast 
from Bering Strait to Belle Isle Strait? Length measured with scale of miles. 
Starting from Bering Strait what do we first pass? (A bay.) Name? (Kotzebue 
Sound.) What next? (A cape.) Name? (Lisburne.) Next? (A cape.) Name? 
(Barrow.) Next? (A river mouth, Colville; another river mouth, Mackenzie.) A 
cape (Bathurst). A strait (Union). A bay (Coronation). A river mouth (Copper- 
mine), etc. Treat remaining coasts in same manner. 
6. Form.—How many oceans bound North America? How long is its northeast 
coast? How wide at its most southern part? (Runs to a point.) What form, then, 
has North America? (Triangular.) 
‘This triangular form is sometimes called the stem or trunk of the continent; the 
peninsulas and islands the branches. What shape is the continental stem of North 
ue rica? 
. Peninsulas,—Read from map in same order as coast. 
8 Islands.—What body of water lies north of North America and west of 97° W. 
from Greenwich? (MelvilleSound.) How many straits lead out of it? Name them; 
first south, then west, north, east. What is this sound surrounded by? (Islands.) 
Howmany? Name them, beginning west of McClintock Channel.and passing north- 
east and south. Other islands treated in a similar manner. If more islands are 
named than the teacher thinks it desirable to have learned, he will indicate upon 
the wall map those that he wishes to be remembered. 
9. Dimensions.—Measure on map length of each side of triangular form. Compute 
area of triangle by known rule. Compare with area given in book. Whence the 
difference (allowances made for projections and indentations)? Measure length of 
North America on 97° W, from Greenwich; on 87° W; on 107° W.; from Bering 
Strait to Isthmus of Pananta, from Strait of Bello Isle to Cape St. Tueas. Width 
on 50°. N.; on 70° N.; on 40° N.; on 30° N.; on 10°.N.; from Cape Hatteras to San 
Francisco Bay; from Delaware Bay to Cape Mendocino; Strait of Belle Isle to 
Gulf of Georgia. How long would it take a train traveling 40 miles an hour to pass 
over each of these distances? 
10, Relief.—Teacher explains that the green coloring indicates lowland—the lighter 
the color, the higher the land. Tho buff color indicates highland. White, the region 
of perpetual snow. (In recent German maps brown tints are used throughout—the 
darker, the higher. On the whole this is to be preferred.) Meanings of terms 
“lowland” and “highland.” What parts of North Am how lowland? What 
parts highland? How many lowlands do you sce? Names given as ‘‘lowland Mac- 
kenzie River,” ‘‘ Hudson Bay lewland,” etc. How many highlands? Names given as 
“Arctic highland,” ‘western highland,” ‘eastern highland.” What connects east- 
ernand western highland? (Highland north of St. Lawrence system.) Name given. 
What connects Laurentian heights with Arctic highland? The distribution of high- 
lands and lowlands being studied, a special study is made of each. The eastern 
highland may serve as an example. Direction (southwest to northeast.) Position 
of southwest extremity; of northeast. Of what composed? (Mountains in center, 
plateaus western, terraces eastern.) Name of the mountair River valleys within 
the system. Name rivers in longitudinal valleys. What transverse valleys? In the 
western highland attention would be called to the arrangement of the mountains on 
its west side, diverging to include the valleys of Sacramento and San Joaquin— 
uniting at Mount Shasta and again diverging. In the Rocky Mountain system the 
difference in character between its southern, central, and northern portions would 
be noted. So also the plateau region between the Rocky and Coast systems and the 
Great Plains east of the Rockies. Similarly the highlands of Central America and 
of Mexico would be noted as divisions of ‘the western highland, to be more fully 
studied when those countries were taken up. It will be noted that the features of 
relief that belong together are studied together. Thus not all the mountains of 
North America first, and then all the v alleys and next the plateaus, but rather first the 
distribution of highlands and lowlands, next cach of these separately; but in each 
studying together Saute that belong together i innature. Thus in Asia, after trac- 
ing the disposition of lowlands and highlands, we might take up the special study of 
the great central highland. Its extent from the Mediterranean to the Pacific would 
first be noted; its increase in width from west to east; the contraction to the vicin- 
ity of 75° E. and 35° N., forming two divisions, castern and western. Next we 
might take the eastern highland; study its extent east and west, north and south; 
its nearly triangular form; note and describe the mountains of its northern, eastern, 
    
    
        
    
    
   
-P-A-G-E-308
298 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  and southern margins; the mountains crossing its interior and the divisions (as 
Soongaria, Thibet, ete.) thus originating. ‘Then, if desirable (as would be the case 
say with the Himalaya Mountains), special study would be made of each of these 
bordering mountains, divisions, ete. 
So again, if the topic were that part of the central European highland lying north 
of the “Alps and between the Rhine and the March, first would be noted the cxist- 
ence of three divisions meeting in the Fichtel Mountains—the Swiss-Bavarian pla- 
teau, the Franconian basin, and the Bohemian basin. Next each in turn would be 
studied as to position, form, boundary, mountains, rivers, etc. 
In brief, the object in view is to develop in the pupil’s mind a picture of the coun- 
try studied that will never leave him, and a sense of the interdependence of related 
geographical features. 
How this observation and description of the contents of a map is to be accompanied 
by representation of the things observed and described will be discussed in the next 
paper. For the present the statement that map drawing is a necessary accompani- 
ment of map reading must suffice. I will in closing call attention to the fact that 
the work so far is analytical—we have merely determined the contents of the map. 
‘The next topic, hydrography, will furnish an opportunity for showing how develop- 
ing questions may bring out ideas of the relations existing between different classes 
of geographical phenomena. 
11, Hydrography.—Our reading of the coast has made us acquainted with the posi- 
tion of the mouths of leading rivers; hence, this will be our starting point for the 
study of hydrography. Questioning should be first directed to fixing the great 
drainage areas in the pupil’s mind. 
What rivers have their mouths between Bering Strait and Belle Isle Strait? Into 
what ocean do they discharge? Procecd in the same manner with remaining coasts. 
Into how many and what oceans do the rivers of North America flow? We will first 
study the rivers flowing into the Arctic Ocean or into any of its bays, gulfs, etc. 
Find the mouth of the Mackenzie River. Follow it till first tributary isreached. In 
what direction do we go? (Southeast.) Name of first tributary ? iw: aters of Great 
Bear Lake from east, through river not named.) In what direction from this point? 
(Southeast. ) ‘Tributary? (Dease River.) What body of waterdo wereach? (Great 
Slave Lake.) In what direction now? (Nearly south.) Some pupils raise hands 
here and state that the river is no longer called tho Mackenzie, but the Slave River. 
The Slave River is traced in Athabasca Lake and the tributary, Peace River, noted 
from Athabasca Lake, south and southwest to Mount Hooker, under name of Atha- 
basca River. Pupils now describe the river from source to mouth. Inthosame way 
two or three leading rivers should be read at each lesson, and the remaining rivers 
to be studied on the same plan indicated. The teacher thus reduces the amount to 
be learned within the limits he deems fit, no matter how much detail the map studied 
may contain. 
The process described above fixes the location of drainage areas, and traces them 
baek to the relief of the land. The next step should connect relief with hydrog- 
raphy as a cetermining cause. Into what ocean do most of the rivers of North 
America discharge directly or through bays, gulfs, ete.? (Atlantic.) On which side 
of North America is the greatest elevation of its surface? (West.) In what direc- 
tion is, then, its largest slope? (To the Atlantic.) Why do most of its rivers flow 
into the Atlantic? Similarly trace the influence of the western highland upon the 
drainage to the Pacific, of the Appalachian highland in directing the Mississippi 
drainage to the Gulf of Mexico, the St. Lawrence to the northeast, and upon the 
formation of the Atlantic slope. 
The pupils, being supposed to know the distinction between upper, middle, and 
low course of rivers, should be questioned upon the relation of this feature to relief. 
Taking first the Atlantic slope, lead them to see that since the eastern part of the 
Appalac’ highland consists in succession of mountains, terrace, and lowland, the 
three divisions are found fully developed in its rivers. Taking next the Mississippi, 
show that the larger part of its course being through a lowland tends to reduce the 
middle course in length. Again show the relation between longest slope and longest 
rivers; how the rivers of North America exceed in length and area drained those of 
the Old World as a consequence of the predominance of lowlands; how this length 
of course through lowland limits their fall and rate of current. Ask the pupils to 
describe a few of the rivers of northern North America east of the western high- 
Jand, and a few of southern North America. Then question them upon their differ- 
ences to show that down to and including the St. Lawrence they are outlets of 
chains of lakes, and below this mainly large streams with numerous branches. 
12. Climate.—Pupils are supposed to know the distinction between continental and 
oceanic climates, and between tropical, subtropical, temperate, steppe, and desert 
climates. Between what two parallels of latitude does North America lie? What 
line crosses southern North America? Northern North America? Through how 
          
            
    
   
-P-A-G-E-309
  TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 239 
many zones does North America extend? Northern zone? Southern zone? Central 
zone? Compare as to temperature. 
Make plain to pupils that this is a division into so-called mathematical climate, 
and takes account mainly of the position of different parts of North America in 
regard to the direction of the sun’s rays. This climate willbe further modified by the 
relief of North America. In what direction does the highest line of elevation cross 
North America? (From north to south.) In what direction the greatest lowland? 
(North to south.) In which half of North America is the greatest highland? In 
which the greatest lowland? Upon what part of the map is the white placed, show- 
ing where snow remains during the 2? Which, then, is the colder, tho great high- 
land or the great lowland? Which half of North America has the largest and most 
baysand gulfs? Into which half does the ocean extend farthest? What climate will 
the east half of North America have? (Oceanic. ) 
In a similar manner it should be shown how this, results from the lower east half 
lying open to moist winds from the Atlantic; how the latitude of the lands north of 
the Gulf of Mexico, and their accessibility to moist winds from the Gulf, gives them 
a subtropical climate with summer rains. Nearly all the later geographies contain 
physical maps upon which the line of northern limit of trees, ete.,is drawn. This 
may be used to point ihe contrast in temperature between the east and west coasts. 
Similarly the continental character of the western half of North America east of 
the Pacific region should be inferred from the relation of the line of greatest eleva- 
tion to the moist winds of the Pacific. So also the subtropical climate of California, 
the steppe climate of the prairie region, etc. If the map gives the ocean currents 
these will aid in reading the climate. Again, a relation may be traced between the 
contrast of east and west in climate and the like contrast in hydrography—between 
the absence of east and west lines of elevation and the comparatively gradual change 
of climate from north to south. If the pupil has learned in the primary grade (as 
he should) some elementary facts abont the climate of Europe, a few comparisons of 
latitude in North America and in Europe may be combined with this knowledge to” 
point out the cooler character of the climate of North America, which may then be 
traced to the wider extension of that continent toward the north, the absence of mar- 
ginal mountains to protect it from arctic winds, the course of the Gulf Stream, ete. 
13. Vegetation.—A majority of our best geographies give upon their physical maps 
the line of limit of trees, etc.,in the same manner as the best German maps, and 
indicate the localities of leading varieties of vegetation. When studying the vegeta- 
tion of the entire earth the grouping into zones and regions, as of palm and banana, 
needle-leaved evergreens, etc., has an advantage in giving broad general views. In 
the study of the grand divisions, however, the grouping by natural province brings 
vegetation into closer relation in relief, hydrography, and climate. The classifica- 
tion given by Professor Griesbach in his Vegetation der Erde is adopted by the 
leading German geographies and will form the basis of the present illustration. 
Calling attention to the line of northern limit of trees, question the pupils as to 
its direction and consequent difference of position on east and west coasts. They 
will easily be led to see that the region north of this line is treeless, and that it is 
appropriately named Arctic province. They will then read from their maps the 
ehyckoterietis vegetation of this province. Appropriate questioning will show the 
influence of the Rocky Mountains in carrying the tree line northward in the north- 
west, and of the deep inlets from the Arctic Ocean in correspondingly depressing it 
farther east. By commencing on the Pacifie Coast and noting the enumeration of 
trees upon the map the limits of the North American forest province may be readily 
traced—its southern limit north of the steppe region of the Great Plain; its south- 
ward extension toward the Gulf on the Atlantic side of North America; the specific 
trees which characterize its western, eastern, and southeastern portions; the connec- 
tion between its position and relief, hydrography, and climate. So, also, the steppe 
province of the prairies, the subtropical Californian province so similar to the 
Mediterranean province in Europe, the Mexican, West Indian, ete. The limits of this 
paper preclude fuller detail, but teachers will readily see how the German idea of 
reading from the map and of not telling the pupil anything that he can find out for 
himself is to be carried out. It may be noted that the vegetation of a country and 
its vegetable products are different matters, and that as regards the vegetation of 
our own country valuable aid may be obtained from volume 9 of the census report, 
epitomized with a good map in Petermann’s Mittheilungen, No. VIII, 1886. 
14, Animals —Should be treated similarly to vegetation, and may be grouped 
according to the climatic regions and provinces of vegetation. 
15. Inhabitants.—In Gerster’s Atlas of Switzerland, described in an earlier paper, 
two maps, one showing the parts occupied by French, Germans, and Italians, and 
another showing the density of populatiun, furnish a basis for an exercise in map 
reading under this topic and for tracing a relation between the facts deli ed 
and the physical structure of the country. Lhe ethnegraphical map of Europe,

  found in the best German school atlases, enables the pupil to see how two lines, 
radiating from Trieste, will follow the line of division between the three dominant 
European races—Romanic, Germanic, and Slavonic—to distinguish the Alps as a 
common meeting ground of the races and other similar facts. Our American geogra- 
phies do not furnish us this aid, and it is hence necessary to teach facts under this 
topic as matters of information, unless teachers, with the aid of the census reports, 
will prepare rough wall maps for this purpose. Ina following paper on graphic work 
in geography an attempt will be made to show the German and Swiss method of 
training pupils to translate the statistics given under the topic ‘“ Population” into 
visible speech on blank maps, thus reading the facts into instead of out of the map. 
Passing some other topics, such as products, industries, etc., with the statement 
that with suitable maps they would be best taught by map reading, I will close this 
paper with an illustration of map reading, applied to the study of the cities upon 
the Atlantic Slope of the United States. 
The lesson would be opened by questions reviewing the relief of the region and 
directing the pupil’s attention to its three divisions—mountains, terrace, and low- 
land. The teacher would then point to such of the cities along the east foot of the 
mountains as he wished learned, the pupils finding them on their hand maps, naming 
them, and if any are upon rivers, noting and naming the rivers. A similar course 
would be followed with the cities near the eastern margin of the terrace and with 
those upon the coast. The gradual approach of the mountains to the coast as the 
north is approached, and the consequent decrease in width of terrace and lowland 
would be noted. The facts being thus read from the map, the connection of this 
position of cities in three lines related to the three lines of relief would be brought 
out. Questions as to the probable mode of transporting goods in mountain and 
comparatively level country, respectively, would lead to change of transportation 
being assigned as a probable reason of the location of cities at the mountain foot. 
Questions as to the effect upon river currents of the passage over the edge of the 
terrace, the formation of water power, and the navigability by large craft carrying 
more goods to the streams below the terrace would point to some of the causes 
determining the location of the second line of cities, while the coast cities are 
obviously at the seat of change from land and river to ocean carriage. None of 
these relations would be told to the pupil; he must be led by the teacher’s questions 
to discover them for himself. 
1t has not been my purpose to make a complete geographical study of North 
America, but to present such illustrations as would show clearly the spirit and 
method of the map reading so much insisted upon by European writers upon geo- 
graphical teaching. That it develops the self-activity of the pupil seems evident; 
equally plain is it that the method requires teaching rather than lesson setting and 
lesson hearing. Undoubtedly it requires hard work from both teacher and pupil; 
undoubtedly it will take more time than memorizing and repeating the words of a 
printed text. It is not, however, in the material world only that a constant relation 
exists between power applied and work accomplished. 
V. Graphic work.—In the summary of work in home geography it is stated that in 
all geographical work there are three steps—cbservation, description, representation. 
I have ventured to include under the term “graphic work” a variety of processes 
which, while differing considerably among themselves, have the carrying out of the 
third step—representation—as their common aim. 
To use a much-abused term, map reading may be described as a process of analysis. 
The pupil sees the map as a whole, and step by step analyzes it into its constituent 
elements. The description of the results thus obtained is to a certain extent a proc- 
ess of synthesis. Butif the pupil goes a step farther and represents what he has 
observed and described the process is complete; he associates the various matters 
of detail so as to form a connected picture of the region studied. Naturally map 
drawing is one of the very obvious directions taken by this work of representation, 
put it is by no means the only form that it assumes. The various geographical ele- 
ments that admit of representation may, perhaps, be roughly classified as position, 
magnitude, and form, using these terms in a very broad sense. In map drawing all 
three are obviously more or less dealt with, but some German geographers—more 
especially Matzat, Kirchhoff, Coordes, and Kiihne—have recently employed methods 
of representing position and magnitude which would seem to be worthy of consid- 
eration and adoption by American teachers. It is the purpose of the present paper 
to speak of these, reserving for later treatment map drawing proper and relief 
work. And, first, as to position. One of the simplest forms of this, suitable for use _ 
with quite young pupils, is to write the names of the geographical objects in their

true relative positions. Thus, if the boundaries of Europe have been studied they 
mav be represented thus:

In a more advanced class, where greater detail is required, as, for instance, the 
seas—North Sea, Sea of Marmora, Black Sea, etc.—a similar plan would be followed. 
As an example may be taken a representation of the positions of the tributaries of 
the Danube within the limits of Germany: Raab, March. Lller.

  The central point of the middle mountains of Germany is formed by the Fichtel 
Mountains, which may also be considered as the meeting point of the plateau system 
of Central Europe north of the Alps—the Swiss-Bavarian Plateau, the Franconian 
Basin, and the Bohemian Basin. In the Fichtel Mountains four other ranges nearly 
meet and four rivers take their rise. If we represent the Fichtel by F, the following 
scheme will represent this important geographical relation:

  In a Prussian school the pupils have studied the relative positions of the twelve 
Prussian provinces just as American children would study the positions of the States.

The numbers, of course, are round numbers. Where a point—as the Harz Mour- 
tains, Stuttgart, etc.,—lies between the given heights, it is written in its proper 
lace. 
2 These examples will be sufficient to show the manner of representing position, 
either horizontally or vertically. Of the value of the plan there can, I think, be 
but little doubt. As an illustration of tho application of the same idea to physicab 
geography let us take the case of the circulation of water, starting from sea, river, 
or land, and returning as rain. This may be expressed by a diagram thus: 
8 ‘ 
N 8 
S : ae 9 Ocean. <——__——_——_ River: <<———_—_—_—_—_—— Land. 
We will now pass to the methods of dealing with geographical magnitudes. I 
presume that many of my readers have questioned what they should do with such 
matters as populations, areas, ete. That some use, for instance, should be made of 
the statistical tables appended to our school geographies will be readily admitted. 
Yet to require the memorizing of these numbers would be absurd. In fact, in them- 
selves, these magnitudes have no value. They have a value, however, the moment 
they are used to express a relation. The tables in my geography give me the follow- 
ing facts respecting the leading States of central Europe: 
  
Population Area. | Population. pei pee

    German Empi it 45,235 83 Austria’s share of central Europe - 1d, 855 1 14 | 192 | 69 
  
I might of course memorize these details, but of what value would they be and 
how long should I retain them? Moreover, the quantities in the second and third 
columns are subject to change. Instead of attempting to memorize them I will 
represent the relations existing between these numbers. Let us first take the areas 
given for the above-named States of central Europe and arranging them in a 
decreasing series, express this by lines of corresponding length, of course “round- 
ing” the numbers: 
German Empire. 
      
  Austrias share of central Europe. 
Switzeriand.
-P-A-G-E-316
    306 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Such a figure appeals to the eye, and the relative length of the lines will remain 
along time in the memory. A pupil who makes such a construction reaps a benefit 
from the work itself. It would of course be desirable to adopt a much larger scale 
than the one here employed. 
Let us now arrange the numbers of the second column in a decreasing series and 
represent the result by lines. 
German Empire. 
       
  == Austrias share of central Europe. 
Belgium. 
etherlands. 
Switzerland. 
Will the pupil who works this diagram out soon forget that the areas of Switzer- 
land, the Netherlands, and Belgium are inversely as their populations? 
A similar treatment of the third column gives us: 
afelgirem. 
       
  Netherlands. 
German Empire. 
aAustriasrshare of central Europe. 
Switzerland. 
Tt would be a valuable exercise to try and trace the remarkable reversal of order 
in this last representation to the character of the surface of each country and its 
position as maritime or inland. 
Let us now attempt to express the area of eaclt country and the density of its 
population together. A square with sides 3$ inches long would express the area of 
Germany. The nearest integral square root of its population considered as hundreds 
is21. Taking a dot to represent each 100 inhabitants, we place within our square 
21 rows, each containing 21 dots, and arranged so as to form squares. Taking Bel- 
gium as the next example, we should have a square with Linch sides and 7 rows, each 
containing 7 dots. The distance between the dots in the square representing Ger- 
many would be ‘2 inch nearly; between those in the square representing Bel- 
gium, }inch. The square representing Switzerland will show the appearance of the 
diagram:
-P-A-G-E-317
TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 307° 
  As another example, take the population of six important cities in thousands: 
London, 3,816; Paris, 2,269; Canton, 1,500; Berlin, 1,278; New York, 1,207; Vienna, 
1,105. ‘Taking a line of 4} inches to represent London, we should have: 
      New York. 
Vienna. 
The example given of the vertical positions between the North Sea and the Swiss 
Jura is also in a certain sense a representation of magnitudes. A similar example 
may be taken from the average depth of the ocean (3,000 meters) as compared with 
the greatest known sea depth. (See figure below.)    
Average Ocean Depth. 
     
Greatest Sea Depth. seaLlevel. 
The average elevation of the land mass above the sea level (a), 650 meters, and the 
two most remarkable depressions below it—surface of the Caspian Sea (b), 26 meters, 
surface of the Dead Sea (¢), 400 meters—may be represented in a diagram profile as 
follows: 
        Sea level. 
e 
For more adyanced work a method is employed by several German teachers of 
geography which represents at the same time the relative areas and the approximate 
forms of the countries:

    308 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Thus, ruling light lines to divide a sheet of paper into squares, the German Empire, 
Holland, Belgium, and Switzerland will take this form: 
NORTH.

                            SOUTH. 
By tinting each country with different crayons the diagram would be much 
improved, and by placing within each country as many dots as it has millions of 
population, an additional relation would be represented. 
The mention of colored crayons suggests another mode of representation, with 
which I will close this paper. Ascertain from the table the density of population 
of certain selected countries. Take a blank map of the countries and with an Eagle 
or other brown crayon pencil fill in the outlines of the countries with lighter or 
heavier strokes according to the density of the population. Of course still nicer 
work could be done with sepia or india ink. 
VI. Graphic work.—Map drawing.—It has already been indicated that the facts and 
relations learned by map reading receive their final association to a complete picture 
of the region studied through map drawing. While the pupil’s verbal statement of 
the results of his map reading does this work to a certain extent—as he can be said 
to know only what he can express—so also has he clearly seen only that which he 
can draw. We must guard ourselves, however, against taking this undoubtedly true 
statement too absolutely. Inthe words of Matzat, ‘‘Things are never drawn as they 
are in full detail; the draftsman represents only such of their features as may impress 
him.” Hence two persons drawing the same landscape may produce strikingly differ- 
ent pictures, yet both be true to nature. This fact lies at the foundation of the dis- 
tinction between artistic and ordinary drawing. Artistic drawing strives to express 
delicate distinctions of form, and this conditiens its «esthetic value. But on the 
other hand, if a young child represents a man by a small circle for the head, a straight 
vertical line for the neck, an oval for the body, and four strokes for arms and legs, 
he has simply drawn those peculiarities of the human form which he has apprehended. 
He has seen many other peculiarities, but they have obviously not made such an 
impression as to result in a visual representation which finds expression in his draw- 
ing. As a drawing this child’s picture is laughable, ridiculous; but, as a delineation 
of the undetailed concept of a man that he has so far formed, it is correct. It would 
have been incorrect had he drawn three arms instead of two. Hence it may be said 
that there is an abstract drawing equally with an abstract thinking, and we should 
distinguish between a picture which must be beautiful and a diagram which need 
only be correct. And the measure of this correctness is in itself relative and sub- 
jective. What the child’s visual representation contains will be reproduced and fixed 
by his drawing. A botanist who draws a diagram of a flower proceeds in the child’s 
manner. He wishes to show the number of petals and sepals, their mode of union, 
etc.; all else is indifferent to him; he is not making a picture of the flower. 
   
-P-A-G-E-319
  TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 309 
This is exactly the case with map drawing. Maps and profiles are not pictures; 
they are diagrams, abstract representations of the region studied. Obviously there 
may be grades of abstraction in these representations—greater or less amount of detail 
‘and exactness of form. I wish to show my friend where I live; I draw a rough plan 
which indicates well enough the position of my home, although the measurements 
may be anything but correct. So a childshould not make a detailed copy of the map 
in his atlas, but should represent the leading features that he has abstracted from 
it. So inthe words of Wagner we observe the object—in the present case a map—fix 
the things observed by drawing, and so give evidence of what we have seen. 
Since younger pupils have less trained powers of observation than older ones— 
since the maps studied in the lower grades should be simpler than those studied in 
the higher—it follows that grades exist in map drawing. The youngest pupils can 
draw a diagram showing the relative positions of a few localities, the course of two 
or three rivers, only a simple geometrical figure for the contour of a country. They 
will thus exercise their self-activity and represent only what they have observed 
upon the map. 
I have aimed to indicate very clearly that, according to the views of some leading 
German writers upon methods in geography, map drawing is a result of geograph- 
ical study, serving, indeed, to fix and associate the ideas obtained from map reading, 
but yet presupposing a knowledge of the facts represented. Observing the map, 
describing the map, precede representing, however closely they may tread upon 
each others heels. When the Pestalozzian reform called attention to the importance 
of making all early teaching objective and the child’s formal and material culture 
an outgrowth of this free self-activity, it effected, among other things, a revolution 
in geographical teaching. Not the least important feature of this revolution was 
its insistence upon the importance of graphic reproduction of geographical knowl- 
edge by map drawing, not that the value of map drawing had not been recognized 
before the time of Pestalozzi, but to him is owing the full perception of its true 
importance. Unfortunately, however, some of Pestalozzi’s followers transferred 
map drawing from its true position of the servant to that of the master, the all in 
all of geographical instruction. The usual reaction followed, and this valuable aid 
was condemned and neglected as a result of the over-zealousness of its advocates. 
The current phrase, ‘‘Teaching geography by map drawing,” is ambiguous. If it 
means that the teacher should constantly accompany his instructions by drawing 
before his pupils the country studied, there can be no doubt of the value of such a 
course. But if it means that geographical ideas can be conveyed in the first instance 
by mapping on the part of the pupil, its truth is questionable. At best, such work 
would be map copying, and of course geographical facts could be learned by the proc- 
ess. This, however, would not be map drawing. A pupil can intelligently deline- 
ate that only of which he has a clear concept. Never can the graphic representation 
of a concept precede its formation; geographical forms can not be drawn unless 
they are known. ‘The various lines of a map have a meaning only when duly inter- 
preted. A pupil’s map is simply a review, valuable as an evidence that he has clear 
and vivid concepts, and, like every review, serving toconfirm them. Buta pupil can 
never originate a knowledge of geographical relations by drawing. In the words 
of Von Sydow: ‘He must so work that each stroke drawn is a pictured thought, 
and the picture itself which he projects a result of his own intuition.” Theodore 
von Liechtenstein, a celebrated teacher of geography in the Berlin Cadet School, 
says: ‘Map drawing has value only in so far as the physical relations of a country 
are delineated in the most time-sparing manner. * * * It will tend most to geo- 
graphical culture if the pupil, after memorizing and reciting the matter, projects in 
rapid outlines the country under consideration; or in the presence of the teacher, as 
a recapitulation, sketches it with chalk upon a blackboard.” As Dr. Abbenrode 
remarks: ‘‘Map drawing,a valuable aid to geographical instruction, is not that 
instruction itself;” and Professor Heiland, of Weimar: ‘ Drawing must not be the 
starting point of the study of a country, but its result.” 
It was remarked above that map drawing should be graded. The map drawn by 
a pupil of the primary grade may, like the child’s picture of a man, be a mere dia- 
gram, and yet may adequately represent the ideas formed from the study of the wall 
map. Professor Gépfert, in an article upon first-year work in geography, remarks 
that ‘Geographical training and understanding does not depend so much in the 
first instance upon exact knowledge of the outline of a land as upon a knowledge of 
its position in regard to neighboring lands, seas, etc. Itis not at first important 
to know that France has ten peninsulas. Rather should the pupil's attention be 
directed to the fact that France lies between two seas and two countries; for in this 
consists itsimportance. So the isolation of Spain, the insular character of England, 
the position of Germany in the heart of Europe are facts of prime importance. For 
the sharp apprehension of these relations it is desirable to disregard all unrelated 
facts. Hence it is necessary only to note certain important limiting points given 
upon the map, as that the northeast boundary point of Germany if continued east-    
    
 
-P-A-G-E-320
  310 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
ward would bisect Russia, and the southwest continued westward, France. So, also, 
the northeast point of Spain continued northward bisects France. These funda- 
mental points in the position of these lands once fixed, much would be gained., 
Further—the relative proportions—Russia equals one-half of Europe, ete.—arereadily 
noted from the map, as also the smallness of Europe compared with Asia and Africa 
and the position of the Mediterranean Sea.” A pupil’s map representing the knowl- 
edge obtained up to this point (Scandinavia, Denmark, Italy, and the Balkan Penin- 
sula havenot yet been studied), amere diagram representing position and proportions, 
would be something like the following figure: 
    If the pupil has noted the triangular form, direction of shores, and isthmus connec- 
tion of North and South America, the following figure would express his knowledge: 
  If at first these maps, or rather diagrams, appear strange, a little consideration 
will show that they are a fair expression of the pupil’s supposed knowledge at this 
stage. The detailed contour of a country it would be impossible for him to fix in 
mind; position and proportion are possible to him, and his diagram represents just 
what he has observed. These figures are in fact but asimplified form of the graphic 
work described in the preceding paper and are but a slight remove from the dia- 
grams in everyday use among statisticians and others. They would seem to admit 
of development into a practical and simple system of elementary map drawing. 
VII. Map drawing.—Wenow pass to filling up the outline. Since the rivers have 
already been noted in reading and representing the coast, Professor Heiland takes 
them up before the relief. (See Art. LI, p. 293.) 
The map reading shows that four great rivers traverse’ the peninsula of Farther 
India from north to south—Irawaddy, Saluen, Menam, Mekoag—and that their direc- 
tion is determined by five meridian mountain chains, diverging southward. Passing 
north we find that the first, second, and fourth named rivers rise near together, 
north of the west part of the tropic of Capricorn. Distance estimated and drawn. 
Trawaddy traced and drawn to Mandalay (halfway down); westward curve of river 
below Mandalay noted and drawn. Branching of delta noted and drawn. Other 
rivers similarly located. Mountain chains studied and drawn. Close by_ profile 
across the peninsula from west to east. Repetition by all pupils on blackboard, 
Drawing on paper at seats without reference to wall or hand map. If this last can 
be worked out in color so much the better. 
 
-P-A-G-E-321
  TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 311 
As a second example, wo will take Dr. Jarz’s method of drawing the outline of 
Africa. He first notes the relation of Africa to the parallel of 10° north latitude and 
the meridian of 40° east longitude from Ferro (20° east from Greenwich, would 
‘answer the same purpose). The length of the meridian between 10° north coast is 
used as a unit of measure. This unit is laid off from the point of intersection twice 
south, once and one-fifth east, once and a half west. This determines, in addition to 
the north coast, Cape Agulhas, Cape Verde, Cape Gardafui. The map is then read 
from Bengazi to Cape Bon and drawn. Then from Bengazi to Rosetta, Rosetta to 
Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb, Bab-el-Mandeb to Mozambique, etc. 
Dr. Steiner’s drawing of the Alps will furnish an excellent example of the treat- 
ment of a complex mountain system. The position of the Alps in a northeasterly 
curve from the Mediterranean to Vienna is first read from the wall map and then the 
coast of the Mediterranean from the Rhone mouth to the Gulf of Quarnero is read, 
drawn on the board, and reproduced by pupils. The eastern limit of the Alps is then 
read and drawn and the difference in width between west and east being noted the 
general form is put in with the length of the crayon resting on the board. The 
valleys are then read and wiped out from the broad belt on the board; so, also, the 
division into three main parallel chains and the chief rivers are noted and drawn. 
The leading passes, cities, railroads, etc., are in succession read and drawn, and 
finally political divisions. Each step in the teacher’s drawing is followed by 
description and drawing by the pupils. 
Matzat’s method has some peculiarities which deserve mention. It is based on 
the idea of the ‘‘compass charts” used by sailors before the introduction of maps 
based on parallels and meridians. ‘‘Buf a very small number of points on the 
earth’s surface are astronomically determined according to latitude and longitude. 
The position of the rest is fixed, either through triangulation or by a survey of 
routes, either in eompass directions or time distances. * * * The net of parallels 
and meridians aims only to fix the position occupied by each terrestrial space in 
relation to the entire surface of the earth. If the terrestrial space is considered by 
itself this net of lines may be dispensed with. The history of cartography shows 
this to be true. Useful maps with parallels and meridians were a product of the 
beginning of the last century; but there were good maps before that time. The 
ancients had maps with such lines, but very incomplete, because they were based 
merely on estimated distances. When the navigators of the Mediterranean dis- 
covered the means of determining direction, they made without parallels and merid- 
ians maps which are even now surprisingly accurate. Upon these two primary 
elements of all specific geographical localization, distance, and direction, in brief, 
the principle of the compass charts, I found the geographical drawing of pupils.” 
After the map is read Matzat directs the teacher to name the point from which the 
drawing shall begin. In countries near home this will be the schoolhouse or the 
native town—in distant countries its chief city, the distance and direction of which, 
however, from the native town, must be first determined. The distance and diree- 
tion from this central point of the first feature to be represented is determined 
by the pupils by measurement on the map. The distance is taken with a pair of 
dividers, and with this radius a circle described from the central point upon the 
wallmap. Features which teuch or are near to this circle and their direetion from 
the central point are then noted. The central point is then marked upon the black- 
board, the circle described upon an agreed scale, and the features noted are drawn. 
This process is repeated by the pupils upon their slates or paper. 
For the sake of completeness it should be noted that the use of map drawing is not 
without its opponents. The most emphatic of these is Dr. Bittcher, director of the 
Real Gymnasium of Burg. In the Easter programme (1884) of this institution he 
publishes an essay, ‘‘ Vorschliige zur Methodik des geographischen Unterrichtes mit 
Beispielen aus der Sechulpraxis.” The first part of this assay is an attack upon the 
use of map drawing. His chief points are that itis an error to assume that map 
drawing is the only way to lead pupils to a knowledge of the map; that it robs the 
subject of time out of all proportion to the results reached, and that may be better 
used otherwise; that the maps drawn by children are horrible caricatures of the 
reality and tend to destroy the truer concepts formed from the study of good wall 
and hand maps; that but few teachers are able to draw cyen passable maps on the 
blackboard. 
Bottcher proposes his ‘‘descriptive method” as superior in every respect to the 
“map-drawing method.” This is briefly a careful reading of the map and a full, 
clear statement of the results guided by the teacher’s questions. Dr. Bittcher has 
recently expanded his essay into a work on Methods in Geography. 
The school section of the First German Geographical Congress, June 7, 8, 1881, 
adopted the following resolutions after an animated discussion of the subject of map 
drawing: 
(1) The German Geographical Congress recommends drawing in geographical 
instruction as an indispensable means to the promotion of clear intuitions and as a 
powerful aid to awakening the self-activity of pupils. 
   
-P-A-G-E-322
    312 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
(2) Tt declares itself most positively against the widespread evil practice of setting 
pupils to draw maps as a home task without fitting them for the work by a gradually 
progressive training. 
(3) It condemns the use of straight lines to express the lines of a map (Lohse’s 
method), since this plan is not adapted to develop the pupil’s sense of form, but 
rather debases his taste in regard to map representations. 
(4) It most positively condemns the systematic carrying out of the so-called con- 
structive method, since it requires an artificial system of aids (lines and points), the 
knowledge of which is in the main of no value to the pupil, and burdens his memory 
heavily in a useless way. 
(5) Condemns special preliminary courses of topographical drawing as aside from 
the purposes of the common school. 
. (6) Itrecommends the method of free sketches of single terrestrial spaces as repro- 
ductions of typical relations studied from the map, since these can be adapted in 
amount of detail and mode of execution to the capacity and skill of the pupils. 
Iclose this subject with the following extracts from ‘‘ Ten theses concerning draw- 
ing in geographical instruction,” adopted at a recent meeting of the teachers and 
inspectors of Vienna: 
“A moderate application of drawing in teaching geography is a pedagogically 
valuable, but by no means indispensable, means to right apprehension and memoriz- 
ing the map. Drawing is only a means, never an end in itself. * * * The 
geographical drawings of the pupils is limited by the degree of their skill in draw- 
ing, the representability of geographical objects.and the special aim of the instruc- 
tion in geography. * * * The pupils’ drawing is restricted to the representation 
of geographical specialties (single rivers, reciprocal positions of places, mountains, 
etc.). Political boundaries, long coast lines, whole countries, and grand divisions are 
excluded. * * * The requirement that at the end of a year the pupil should by 
way of review be able to draw from memory the maps of the year is condemned on 
account of the resulting overburdening.” 
VIII. Relief work—The graphic representation of relief.—Ordinary maps furnish-a 
fairly accurate representation of two out of the three dimensions of terrestrial 
spaces—length and breadth. If the principle of the projection used is taken into 
account, they also include the element of curvature of the earth’s surface. This is 
true whether the projection aims at equivalence or at conformity. But when the 
third dimension, thickness or relief, is to be represented, the case is somewhat dif- 
ferent. Thoesigns employed are in a certain sense conventional, yet are at the same 
time a generalization from observed natural facts. The conventionality consists in 
making a special case general. Thus, if the method of shading is used—whether in 
lines (hachures) or in flat tint—the light is assumed to fall vertically upon the sur- 
face to be represented. Under such conditions all horizontal surfaces would receive 
full light, and would be left white. Vertical surfaces would receive no light, and 
hence would be shaded absolute black. Surfaces of intermediate inclination would 
be lighter or darker, according to inclination. Thus, at 45° slope the shade marks 
would occupy half the space, leaving the remaining half white. In a slope making 
80° with the plane of the horizon we should have one-third shade, two-thirds white. 
On the contrary, a slope of 60° would have two-thirds shade and one-third white. 
For exact topographical (e. g., military) maps this system is applied exactly, and 
a “shade scale” attached to such maps enables the user to learn readily the slope 
of the country. Generalized, we have the principle the darker the shading the 
steeper the slope, and to this extent it should receive consideration in good school 
maps, especially in wall maps. Of course, as a matter of fact, it is only in certain 
places and at certain times that the sun light falls vertically, and it is in the assump- 
tion of this condition as universal in place and time that the conventional element 
in representing relief consists. In some countries map draftsmen make a modified 
assuption—they take the light obliquely, usually from the northwest. This is com- 
monly the case inspecial maps of parts of the Alps, and is justified by the prevailing 
greater steepness of their south and east slopes. But in a combination of hill with 
high mountain country this method would fail in expressing properly the hill land. 
French map makers employ this plan almost uniformly and with justice, as a glance 
at the physical structure of France will show—its steepness toward the valleys of the 
Rhine and the Rhone, its plateau and terrace structure to the west and northwest. 
But this convention not only serves to express the relative steepness of mountains, 
it also gives a clue to their form. 
A pupil who possesses a knowledge of the language in which a map expresses 
relief will be able to read from a properly made map, and to give a clear and definite 
account of the physical structure of the region he is studying. It is one of the 
objects of home geography to put the pupil in possession of this power. ‘The need 
for this knowledge is‘also one of the reasons that make it desirable to precede 
graminar grade work in geography by a course in advanced home geography. To 
this end, also, the best German and Swiss school atlases contain one or more maps 
   
-P-A-G-E-323
TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 313 
  _especially designed as an ‘‘introduction to the understanding of maps” (Zur Ein- 
-fiihrung ins Kartenverstiindniss). 
Shading expresses the form and degree of inclination of relief, but gives no knowl- 
edge of its amount, 
The reader is undoubtedly familiar with the method employed on physical maps 
for representing the difference of elevation between highland and lowland by color- 
ing one brown, the other green. This is really an application of the method 
explained above, since the line of separation between the two colors is a line of 
elevation; it isalso acontourline. On Professor Guy ot’s wall maps the depth of the 
mountain shading is used as index of height. This is objectionable, since this ele- 
ment has already been employed, as stated, to represent the degree of slope. It, 
however, points to a method largely used in Europe as an adjunct to contour maps. 
The spaces between the contours are colored either with different colors for each 
degree of elevation or with different tones of the same color. Usually in the latter 
case a warm yellow brown is used, increasing in depth as the height increases, 
Accessible examples of this are the hypsoimetric United States map in Scribner’s 
Statistical Atlas, and a similar map in Vol. I of the Tenth Census. A good example 
of this use of combined contour and color for school purposes is Dr. Carl Vogel’s 
Schul-atlas, published by Hinrichs, Leipsic. On his map of Europe, for instance, 
four tones of brown are used. The lightest represents lowland, the others suc- 
cessively 250, 1,500, 3,000 feet, the snow region being left white. A very beautiful 
modern example is an “ Orographical Map of Scotland,” by John Bartholomew, in 
Vol. I (1885) of the Scottish Geographical Magazine. A large scale edition of this 
(22 by 29 inches, or 10 miles to an inch) has been published by Black, of Edin- 
burgh. In the small sketch maps illustrating E. v. Seydlitz’s Schul Geographie the 
same idea is carried out, using horizontal shade lines of different depths instead 
of color. This is, of course, not quite so effective, but still it gives a fair idea of 
gradations of elevations. 
In some of the more recent German school atlases shading to represent slope and 
form has been combined with contour lines and color to represent clevation. This 
would seem to leave nothing more to be desired. Asan example may be cited ‘‘Debbe’s 
Schul-atlas fiir die mittleren Unterrichtsstufen” (equivalent to our grammar school) 
in 33 maps. In these maps, in addition to the mountain shading, the zones of eleva- 
tion are marked as follows: Depressions, green; sea level to 200 meters, light green; 
200-500 meters, light yellow; 500-1,500 meters, light brown; 1,500-5,000 meters, 
brown; above 5,000 meters, gray green. As these colors are transparent the mountain 
shading shows distinctly throngh them. The cost of this atlas of 33 maps (including 
an ethnological and a language map of Europe) is 1.25 marks—about 35 cents. A 
supplement of 16 physical maps (climatic, geological, ethnological, etc.) costs 1.75 
marks, about 45 cents. Moreover, the pupil can buy the maps one by one as needed 
at a slight advance on the price of the entire set. 
In the foregoing my purpose has been to show the great importance attached by 
“uropean teachers of geography to an adequate representation of relief and the care 
taken to insure its realization by the pupil under the three points of view, form, 
degree of slope, and elevation. It is interesting to see how these teachers pass from 
accurate graphic representation of relief to accurate tangible representation—a very 
different thing from the indiscriminate mud-pie making from inaccurate maps that 
passes muster as relief work in many American schools. 
    PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS. 
A few excerpts from the writings of an American teacher (published in “ European, 
Schools”) who visited German schools may here be inserted, since they show the 
actual status of geographical teaching as he observed it. These notes lay no claim 
to systematic: arrangement, for they were gathered as occasion offered, and published 
in various journals. % 
Homeology.—‘ Heimathskunde,” knowledge of home and its surroundings, is 
what they term primary geography in Germany. In order to give the reader an 
idea of what is done in the primary grades, a few suggestions may suffice. Some 
lessons in “homeology” were heard in Hamburg and enjoyed very much. The 
results of the lesson were fixed in the form of a sketch map. ‘This map was made on 
the board as the lesson proceeded. 
TEACHER. In what direction is our school from the inner Alster, or Alster Basin? 
What street on this side of the basin? On the opposite side? On the third? 
fourth? What separates the inner from the outer Alster? What bridge? What 
monuments are erected on the esplanade? In what direction from the basin is the 
Nicolai church? The new polytechnicum? The theater? The Berlin depot? On 
what side of the Alster Basin is the new hotel, the Hamburger Hof, situated, ?¢ ete. 
Some streets were sketched in order to make the picture more vivid.   
-P-A-G-E-324
314 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  Every new item was inserted in the sketch on the board drawn by the teacher. 
' Thus the sketch of a city plan grew by degrees, and the pupils drew or imitated this 
plan on their slates. One can not imagine a more attentive group of young children 
than these were. Each one was eager “to suggest new points known to him. The 
sketch was copied as the lesson progressed, and its simplicity spoke for itself. No 
teacher can hide his unwillingness to follow suit behind so flimsy an excuse as ‘I 
can’t draw,” for the drawing of such a sketch presupposes no training nor special 
skill in drawing. 
When the geographical part of the lesson was well disposed of the teacher gave a 
new zest to the pupils by asking, ‘‘To whom belongs the theater, the school, the 
bridge,” etc.? In the most natural way possible the pupils learned something of 
governmental relations and laid the foundation for the subsequent study of history. 
It caused a merry interruption when a little boy thought the schoolhouse belonged 
to Mr. , the janitor. 
In a higher grade of the same school the geography of Germany was the topie of 
the day. It was still ‘‘ homeology,” only with a wider horizon. The teacher began 
by making a few simple lines representing the so-called ‘mountain eross” in cen- 
tral Europe. After first drawing the Fichtel Mountains, the center of the figure, he 
added the Erz Mountains toward the northeast, the Franconian and Thuringina 
forest toward the northwest, the Bohemian and Bavarian forest toward the south east, 
the Franconian and Swabian Jura toward the southwest. A few peaks were men- 
tioned, as were also the characteristics of these mountains. Thus, for instance, the 
silver mines in Saxony, the dense forests in Bohemia, the lovely scenery in Thur- 
ingia, the caves of the Jura, ete., came in for a few well-remembered remarks. The 
teacher always knew when to stop; he was discretion personified. 
Now the teacher drew the fourrivers which rise in the Fichtel Mountains—namely, 
Main, Saale, Eger, and Naab—showing and indicating on the map into what mam 
rivers they empty. A few important ‘ities and the countries around the cross were 
named. All this information was partly given, partly asked for, as the case sug- 
gested. 
Now the complete map, a printed one, was hung up, and all the information just 
gained was looked up. Each item was noted, and it made the children fairly glow 
with enthusiasm when they were able to corroborate the facts of the two maps. In 
a few points the map on the board was corrected, improved, and completed; then the 
lesson closed, and now followed the recitation—that is to say, the pupils were ealled. 
upon to state, i in answer to leading questions, what they remembered of the lesson. 
It was a pleasure to hear them speak out, not like human parrots who had memo- 
rized, but like rational beings who had learned by experience. The hour was brought 
to a close by an imaginary journey all over the section the acquaintance of which 
they had just made. Many little items of information were added on this journey. 
Photographic views of rocks and mountain scenery were exhibited, and they proved 
to be of intense interest to these ese who haye no opportunities of seeing a 
mountain ‘in natura.” 
Ideal teaching in geography.—It was in w preparatory school in the city of D—— 
where ideal teaching in geography was heard. The school was provided with all 
possible means in form of maps. The matter of instruction could be graded just as is 
done in arithmetic, reading, ete. Geographical knowledge has for ages been wrested 
from overstocked maps. The child has to seareh painfully among a bewildering 
mass of data and facts for those which were to be learned. A systematic or method- 
ical progress step by step was, ifnot impossible, certainly very difficult. Just as little 
as a teacher would give into the hands of a child a copy of Webster’s Unabridged 
or of Shakespeare’s complete works when he begins to learn the art of reading, just 
as little can it be rational in the teaching of geography to place before him a complete 
map stocked with a bewildering number of details. 
This difficulty was removed in the school referred to, Outline maps were used; 
first river maps. All the water courses and the ocean were colored blue, while the 
land appeared black, Below each map was given a profile, or longitudinal vertical 
section on certain given lines. The pupils drew the map on paper and then inserted 
the elevations. Then followed another outline map containing the elevations and 
a few boundary lines. By degrees more items of information were added, such as 
cities, trunk roads, canals, ete. The principle of Father Pestalozzi, “ One difficulty 
at one time,” was carefully heeded, and the pupils were not bothered with maps such 
as we use in America, which blur the children’s mental picture by their multiplicity 
of detail. 
Teachers are apt to labor under the misapprehension that a map is a good one 
when it contains much. This is an error. According to that argument a school 
reader would be a good one only when it contained the ‘whole literature from Alfred’s 
time to the present day. Outline maps, silhouette maps, and such means for teach- 
ing geography rationally are coming into use in Europe as well as with us in 
America,   
   
-P-A-G-E-325
TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 315 | 
The school referred to was lavishly provided with maps and charts. Thero were 
outline, silhouette, and complete maps, geographical, historical, physiological, phys- 
ical, and astronomical maps and charts. What a wealth there was! And what a joy 
it must be to teach in such a school! 
Silhouette practice maps.—The silhouette practice maps facilitate the grading of the 
matter of instruction and present opportunities for the gradual upbuilding of geo-, 
graphical knowledge as gained item byitem by the child. Upon these maps may be 
entered as upon a blackboard the data to be learned, first by the teacher, afterwards 
by the pupils, and thus an opportunity is afforded to the child to become a self-active 
participator in the lesson, When the lesson is completed, all marks or names can be 
erased with a moist sponge or cloth, and the map i: ready for a new lesson or a review. 
The silhouette practice maps enable the instructor in history to illustrate with 
colored crayon changes in political boundaries at different periods. Students of 
ancient history, as well as general and modern history, can use these maps with 
greatadvantage. They donot make common wall maps superfluous, but supplement 
palmer 82%. 
These maps [as sometimes made] are printed on heavy tack cardboard and covered 
with a durable waterproof cleansable surface, adapted to receive a succession of 
markings and cleansings. The shaded space represents the watersurfaces. Oceans, 
lakes, and rivers appear in blue on these maps, the land in black; hence their name, 
silhouette maps. They are called practice maps because the pupil can practice on 
them with crayon geography as he does arithmetic, 
Cause and effect in geography.—The Popular Educator, of Boston, published in 
1887-88 some excellent contributions which offered in words and pictures the present 
status of geography teaching in Germany. These articles leave but little to say on 
that subject. One thing can be done, though, and it is done willingly, namely, to 
say that the statements made in those articles are correct. German teachers, not 
only in Saxony, where the author evidently gathered his information, but also in 
other parts of the Empire, do teach geography as there stated ; if modified somewhat, 
perhaps, essentially the same methods are pursued, and that with wonderful results. 
One would like to transfer to Germany some of our American teachers who can not 
imagine a geography lesson without verbatim memorizing of the printed text. One 
would like to show them rational teaching. The fact is well known that we, too, 
have good teachers, and not a few, either; but it must please a visitor greatly to 
find every teacher, good and poor, following well-established principles of method. — 
That is the true state of affairs in the city of D——. Even the poor teachers are not 
without professional training. There is, however, a deep shadow on this bright 
picture. Many schools are very poorly equipped with means of instruction, such as 
maps and charts. 
A lesson in geography was listened to in a German school where 70 boys sat 
together like sardines in a box. The teacher had nothing better than a medium- 
sized wall map made by himself. His mode of marking elevations was very simple 
and comprehensive, one which is well worth imitating. With pencil or pen he 
shaded the map by means of lines crossing each other at various angles. Thus he 
represented the topography of a country in a remarkably accurate manner, and this 
easy method enabled his pupils to judge at a glance as to the height of the land. 
They saw why certain rivers took such and such a course and no other; why certain 
cities were cold, others warm; why a river was navigable or not, according to the 
abruptness of the slope; why certain rivers flowing from great heights had a 
straighter course than those which had little fall and meandered through the plain; 
why certain lands are blessed with mild climates, being sheltered on the north side 
by high and steep mountain ranges, others had a rough climate, being exposed to 
the north wind. 
The teacher was well informed and gave information in such a manner that it 
agreed with the children’s mental stomachs. 
Example: The Erz-Gebirge (Ore Mountains) were once full of silver mines. At 
the time of Martin Luther (at the beginning of the sixteenth century) these mines 
drew a great number of people to Saxony, and particularly to that range of mour- 
tains. When the mines ceased to yield, the population, not being so fluctuating as” 
it is now, was obliged to seize upon other modes of occupation. The slopes of the 
mountains being well provided with various kinds of wood, offered material for a 
variety of woodworking industries. The slopes being steep, the mountain brooks 
were turbulent and gave an opportunity to build mills, which were first used for 
various purposes. Lately, when the textile industry grew, this water power was 
utilized to serve that industry. The woods soon Cisappeared on the Erz Mountains; 
they were literally used up. So the people had to resort to manufacturing pursuits 
almost entirely, agriculture being impossible. To-day the population of the King- 
dom of Saxony is the densest of all Germany, and, aside from that in Belgium, the 
densest in all Europe. 
lt was cause and effect constantly, and the attention and responsiveness of the 
boys were truly delightful.    
  
   
 
-P-A-G-E-326
  316 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
One other hint was received in this school. When the oral lesson closed, the 
teacher sent a boy to the blackboard to make a sketch of the map which the other 
boys were told to make on their slates. Then he showed that distances which he 
could cover with the span of his hand should be made 1 inch long on the slate or 6 
inches on the blackboard. Now he measured off certain points on the map by 
spans, and thus gave the pupils a simple seale by means of which they could furnish 
a free-hand map which was not out of proportion. This procedure leads the way 
to a more accurate scale and to the thorough comprehension of scales as such. 
Afterwards even this measuring by spaus would be discontinued, and mere eye 
measuring would be substituted. It was a fine lesson, indeed a fruitful lesson. 
Concentric extension of the geographical horizon.—It is always attended with a feel- 
ing of satisfaction when one observes an idea consistently carried through the dif- 
ferent stages of the curriculum, especially if that consistency is in strict compliance 
with educational maxims and principles. In Berlin a truly refreshing example of 
consistency is offered in the schoolbook used in the study of geography, which book 
is an atlas pure and simple, not a text-book. It may not be without interest to read 
an account of what that book contains, for it is gotten up with undeniable skill. 
The reader must kindly bear in mind that the atlas is made expressly for use in the 
elementary (or communal) schools of Berlin. The idea which is so consistently car- 
ried through in it is expressed in the above heading. 
Page 1 contains six pictures and plans. The first figure is a perspective view of 
the inside of a schoolroom, and side by side with it isa map plan of thatroom. This 
is nothing new in America. Many American text-books of geography contain a sim- 
ilar illustration. It is here mentioned for no other reason than to present an 
unbroken chain of methodical links. Notice that the atlas does not begin with the 
hemispheres. The picture with its attendant plan represents the first circle of the 
pupil’s geographical horizon and is drawn on a scale of 1 to 100. 
‘Then foilows a perspective view of the whole schoolhouse and a map plan of the 
building. These form the second circle. Scale: 1 to 300. The bird’s-eye view of 
the figure is certainly an ingenious contrivance. 
This is followed by a perspective view of a portion of a city and its map plan. 
The schoolhouse is again found on this map. These two figures form the third circle 
of the pupil’s horizon. Scale: 1 to 1,500. 
Page 2 contains a larger perspective view of a landscape accompanied by a map 
plan. We find the same schoolhouse and portion of the town represented in the two 
figures which form the fourth circle. Scale: 1 to 7,500. 
Page 3. This extension of the horizon is followed on page 3 by a picture of an 
imaginary landscape which is inserted for the purpose of teaching the most vital 
topographical ideas. This picture also is accompanied by a map plan. 
Page 4 contains a minute city plan of Berlin, which forms the fifth circle of the 
horizon. Scale: 1 to 36,000. 
Page 5 is Berlin and vicinity, the same city plan but much reduced in size and 
surrounded by many villages, hamlets, etc., within a radius of 12 kilometers. This 
forms the sixth circle. Scale: 1 to 100,000. 
Page 6 isa map of the governmental district of Potsdam, in the center of which 
Berlin is situated, this being the seventh circle. Scale: 1 to 1,000,000. 
Page 7 is a physical map of the province of Brandenburg (center Berlin). Eighth 
circle of horizon. Scale of map: 1 to 1,260,000. Map contains also a local map 
exhibiting the railroads entering Berlin. 
Page 8 is a political map of the same province. Scale the same. Local map of 
the city of Potsdam. 
Page 9 is a physical map of Germany. Ninth circle of horizon. Scale: 1 to 
4,000,000. 
"Page 10 is a political map of Germany. Same circle; same scale. Local map of 
the Thuringian principalities. 
Page 11 is a physical map of Europe. Tenth circle of horizon. Scale: 1 te 
15,000,000. Page 12 contains the political map of Europe. Same circle; same scale. 
Page 13 contains the map of Asia. Scale: 1 to 50,000,000. 
Page 14 contains the map of Africa. Scale: 1 to 40,000,000. Local maps of the 
Nile Delta, Cape Colony, and Cape Town. 
Page 15 contains the map of North America. Scale: 1 to 35,000,000. 
Page 16 contains the map of South America. Same scale. 
Page 17 contains the map of Australia and Oceanica, with local map of Victoria 
Land, and an illustration of the formation of coral reefs. Scale of main map: 1 to 
50,000,000. 
The foregoing five maps may be considered the eleventh circle. 
Page 18 is again a local map, namely, that of Palestine, a map which is very use- 
ful to teachers and pupils in the study of biblical history. 
Page 19 contains the twelfth circle of geographical horizon, namely, the Eastern 
Hemisphere.

Page 21 directs tho pupils look upward to the heavens. It contains a representa- 
tion of the northern sky, with the most important constellations and the milky way. 
Page 22, the last one in the book, is devoted to mathematical geography. It con- 
tains illustrations of the eclipses, of the earth’s orbit, the solar system, the phases 
of the moon, and various very useful devices of similar nature. * * * 
These, then, are the contents of the elementary geography in use in the city of 
Berlin. One may, perhaps, advance objections to this, that, or another item; may 
object, for instance, to the picture of the quaint city as being fore*gn to our pupils’ 
surroundings. It must be repeated, for his benefit, that the atlas is not made for 
American children, but for the children in Berlin. It might be possible to present 
a series of pictures and accompanying map plans which could be used in large cities, 
such as New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago. 
One may, perhaps, consider it somewhat of a strait-jacket to be tied down to 
such a course, one which will not give the precocious child a chance to look beyond 
the “board fence of the circle.” To him it may be said: There is no objection at 
all for any precocious child to look at the next pages and ask questions about them, 
but the regular, methodical course is here prescribed according to the principle 
“¥rom the near to the remote.” If he desires to deviate from the course, he may 
skip a few pages, and return to them whenever he sees fit. 
But the consistency with which the principle of education that presupposes con- 
centric growth is carried out deserves commendation. We are too often talking of 
principles and shunning to apply them. Here isasample of that consistency which 
does what it preaches. Whether we like it or not, we may at least be just, and find 
it praiseworthy as such. 
Cause and effect in geography.—lt was a spirited lesson in geography that was heard 
in Munich, and is worthsketching. The children were of the same age as our pupils 
in the highest grade of the grammar-school course—13 or 14 years of age, perhaps. 
Maps were there in abundance, and a handsome large globe was brought in. 
The teacher first stated the fact that the heat equator is not synonymous with the 
mathematical equator; that it is an irregular line lying on an average of 10° north 
of the actual equator. Now he led the pupils to find causes for this apparently sin- 
gular fact. Did not the sun strike the earth with equal force north and south of 
the equator? With the aid of a large globe, on which the prevalence of water on 
the Southern Hemisphere could be seen distinetly by all the pupils of the class, the 
fact was soon established that this prevalence of water caused more evaporation 
than on the Northern Hemisphere. Evaporation, however, they knew from the little 
study of physics they had had, caused absorption of heat, while land would radiate 
the heat it received, and thus cause a higher degree of temperature in the atmosphere. 
Now proofs of this fact were searched for, and it was interesting to see how 
quickly the pupils reasoned backward from effect to cause. In the deserts of Sahara 
and Gobi they thought that they found the effect of great heat on large bodies of 
land. In the indented coast line of Europe they found the cause of a temperate 
climate and an absence of dreary wastes of deserts. 
Then the climate of the different continents was discussed and the general rule 
established, (a) that great bodies of land have hot summers and fierce winters; 
proofs, inner North America, inner Asia, inner Australia, even Russia in Europe; 
(b) much water was the cause of cool summers and inild winters: Proofs, Western Eu- 
rope, South America, Southern Africa, and the Asiatic isles and peninsulas. Water 
tempers the climate. 
This lesson was truly admirable, but only its bare results can be given. 
The latitude, it was easily inferred, caused the climate. But the latter was 
greatly modified—that is, made milder or fiercer—by the situation or elevation of 
the country. A plateau would naturally be cooler than a low plain under the same 
latitude. Quito in Ecuador, and Paré in Brazil, both almost under the equator, 
were yet very different in their climates, the former being situated 10,000 feet above 
the level of the sea, the latter almost on a level with it. 
Mountain chains like the Andes, the Rockies, the Himalayas, the Alps, etc., are 
also causes of great differences in climate, as they may protect the land from certain 
atmospheric currents and other influences. This was proved by the great fertility 
of the eastern slope and the rainless western slope of the Andes, also by the two 
slopes of the Rockies. 
‘These different considerations were summed up in this: Latitude, formation, and 
elevation of a country condition its climate. 
But climate alone does not make a country a desirable place to dwell in. Other 
things are needed to make it fertile, otherwise Australia ought to be overcrowded, 
whereas it is but thinly populated. Irrigation is an important condition. Look at 
Western and Central Europe, and the United States; these countries are admirably 
irrigated—i. e., watered and drained. The teacher dwelt on this by showing that 
the United States have in their Mississippi Valley the granary of the world, a most    
-P-A-G-E-328
    318 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. - 
ideally irrigated, fertile region. 4 Fertility was traced to irrigation in France, Ger- 
many, Italy, Turkey, and Spain. 
The latter country served as an example to prove that climate, elevation, and 
irrigation will not suffice to maintain life if the soil is not favorable. In Spain the 
forests that used to crown the lovely mountains, and constantly feed the picturesque 
and nagivable rivers meandering through the valleys, have been uprooted. Ruthless 
extermination of the forests had made the hills bare, the rain had washed the fer- 
tile soil from the unprotected mountain sides, and the rivers now dry up in summer 
and threaten death and destruction in spring, when the melting of the snow fills the 
river beds and causes inundations. 
So, then, proper soil is another condition of life, and we have the principle that 
climate is caused by latitude, formation, and elevation of the country; that proper 
climate, favorable irrigation, and good soil condition an exuberant vegetation. 
Vegetation, of course, is a condition necessary for the animal kingdom. But, while 
the latter depends for subsistence upon vegetation, the former is in no small degree 
dependent upon animal matter for subsistence. So, again, we have cause and effect. 
And the chain lengthens; latitude and elevation cause climate; climate and irriga- 
tion condition vegetation. All these are necessary to support the animal kingdom. 
Where all these conditions are favorable human existence is assured, and the 
human population of a country stands in exact proportion to the presence or absence 
of these conditions. This was conclusively demonstrated by the population of North 
America. The United States, situated in the temperate zone, traversed by lofty 
mountain ranges which afford admirable irrigation, possessing on the whole a very 
fertile soil, had all the conditions of an exuberant vegetation and support of animal 
and human beings. Consequently we find them populated by about 60,000,000, while 
north and south of them, in Canada and Mexico, the population is comparatively 
sparse. 
The pupils were almost breathless with attention, and, when called upon, gave 
geographical facts in support of the teacher’s assertions quite readily. This was a 
review lesson, which, while offering new vistas into the science of geography, caused 
the pupils te brush up their knowledge of geographical facts. 
The task given out for the next lesson was: “ Find proofs for the truths we have 
discovered to-day.” 
«Will they be able,” asked the visitor, “to find more proofs?” 
“T should think so,” was the reply of the teacher. ‘They worry their fathers, 
mothers, uncles, and aunts for further proofs; they consult the libraries; they ransack 
every source of information, until they find proofs. A truth thus discovered, as we 
did in this lesson, acts like leaven; it grows and induces the learner to proceed in 
his investigations. And it will scarcely be necessary to recapitulate these facts, 
for indigenous thoughts are like words engraved with steel into granite, while 
borrowed thoughts, such as are learned by heart from the printed page, are words 
written with a reed on dry sand; the next rain will wash them out.” 
CONCLUSION. 
In connection with the foregoing it would seem proper to mention several devices 
recently brought out in this country. They consist of relief maps for the use of 
schools. All relief work in sand, clay, and putty on a large scale, done by pupils, 
must necessarily remain crude and imperfect. Sand maps invariably exhibit incor- 
rect outlines, exaggerated elevations, and various other imperfections, which tend 
to vitiate the geographical image in the mind of the child and thus perpetuate 
incorrect impressions. Map drawing which, of necessity, has to be done quickly, 
owing to the short time that can be devoted to it, is not likely to facilitate the acqui- 
sition of correct geographical knowledge. For the purpose of obviating both these 
difficulties, and to adhere to the principle that we learn by doing, embossed relief 
maps are designed. It is intended that the child shall use these maps as supplements 
to its text-book. Being made of cardboard of the same size of the text-book, he can 
slip the relief map into his book, carry it home and use it as a geographical slate. 
These maps are manufactured like embossed flowers, and covered with a washable, 
cleansable surface, which permits a succession of pencil markings and cleansings. 
Being very Gurable, these maps can be used as long as the instruction on a continent 
or country lasts. The chief excellence of these maps lies in the fact that the pupils 
have before them nothing but the coast lines of the continent, the elevations and the 
rivers, and no names whateyer, hence the maps can not be charged with containing 
a multiplicity of detail that might bewilder the child. He can enter all geograph-

ical data as he is made acquainted with them; he can trace with pencil the coast 
lines, boundary lines, river courses, elevations, etc.; he can locate cities, battlefields, 
railroads, harbors, islands, peaks, ete.; he can perform geographical tasks as he 
solves his problems in arithmetic, on a slate, and then erase them with a sponge as 
he cleanses his slate. The geographical instruction can thus be made a step by step 
procedure. The teacher can climinate that part of knowledge which is not suitable 
at a given age of the pupil; in other words, she can grade the instruction as she 
does the difficulties in arithmetic and grammar. These cleansable relief maps pre- 
vent wrong impressions concerning the outlines, since they are made according to 
approved models in form of flat surface maps. Of course they can not be as correct 
as relief maps on a large scale might be, but they are sufficiently clear and distinct 
without showing too great exaggerations of elevations. 
Relief maps are also made of plaster and other hard material in this country on 
a much larger scale than those described in the foregoing paragraph. They repre- 
sent the curvature of the earth’s surface, are excellently executed, and will doubt- 
less facilitate the teaching of geography. 
Relief wall maps of papier miché are also published in America on a large scale. 
These attempts supersede the flat surfaced wall map by giving names and boundary 
linesin color. They are set in wooden frames and can be suspended on the wall. 
And, lastly, a relief globe is published which shows the elevations and depressions 
on land as well as the depressions of the bottom of the sea. It is a superb piece of 
workmanship, and will doubtless contribute to the acquisition of correct geograph- 
ical concepts.

CHAPTER VIII. 
THE COMMON SCHOOL SYSTEM OF BAVARIA. 
[A brief statement by Lorenz Rurser, teacher in Munich.] 
After the treaty at Versailles, November 23, 1870, the Kingdom of 
Bavaria was invited, with the other twenty-four German States, to 
form the present German Empire (Deutsches Reich). For a number of 
concerns, such as industry and its protection, traffic, and duties, a com- 
mon system of values, weights, and measures, railroad, telegraph, and 
postal service, army and navy, sanitary and veterinary police, etc., the 
laws for the entire Empire are made by an imperial council (Bundes- 
rath), together with the imperial diet or parliament (Reichstag), and 
published, if they find the sanction of the Emperor, in the national 
governmental journal (Reichsanzeiger). But outside of these things 
Bavaria is independent as regards the making of its own laws with 
respect to home and property, as well as the management of its rail- 
road, postal and telegraph system (Wiirtemberg also has this right 
reserved), and during peace the chief command of the army remains 
in the hands of its own king. 
The schools, and especially the common school system, are left to the 
government of each separate state, with the exception that the imperial 
laws retain certain general rights relating to them. For instance, the 
national regulation of industry (Reichsgewerbeordnung) of July 7, 
1883, in article 135, states: 
Children under 13 years of age shall not be employed in factories. Children over 
13 years may only be employed in factories when they are no longer required to 
attend the common schools. The length of time for the employment of children - 
under 14 years of age shall not be more than six hours a day. Young persons 
between 14 and 16 years of age shall not be employed in factory work longer than 
ten hours a day. 
Article 62 states: “In the pursuit of the peddling business, traveling 
from place to place, it is forbidden to employ children under 14 years 
of age.” According to the law of compulsory vaccination (Impfgesetz), 
enacted April 8, 1874, for the entire Empire, every child on entering 
the common schoo! must present a certificate of vaccination, and every 
pupil attending either a public or private school must undergo a second 
vaccination sometime during his twelfth year of age. According to 
323
-P-A-G-E-334
  324 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
article 35 of the national criminal code (Reichsstrafgesetzbuch) no child 
under 12 years of age shall be subjected to any punishment under 
eriminal law. According to article 123 of the same law entering a 
school by any person without authority or a permit is prohibited. 
Throughout the Empire the general law of compulsory education has 
been established, but in the different states the age of entering and 
leaving the common school is not the same. 
The various school systems of Germany are divided on denomina- 
tional lines. The local superintendency of the common schools rests 
chiefly in the hands of the clergy, but as exceptions may be noted the 
public (common) schools of Baden according to the law of October, 
1860 (amended in 1862 and 1868), were separated from the church, The 
same was done in Hessia according to a law passed June 16, 1874, 
The denominational schools of Wiirtemberg, which have had their own 
school laws since 1836 (amended in 1858 and 1865), have a combined 
state and ecclesiastical superintendency. The Duchies of Anhalt and 
Saxe-Coburg-Gotha also have their own school laws. The efforts of 
the Prussian Government to organize the public school system of that 
Kingdom by a general organic law have not yet been successful, and 
the bills to this effect which have been submitted to the House of Dep- 
uties (Abgeordnetenhaus) for the last few decades (repeated January 
14, 1892) have not found the approval of the house. The public school, 
as proposed in this bill, was in future to be religious in character with- 
out exception. The school was to be surrendered to the church. 
‘When the bill was submitted it called forth a great commotion through- 
out the whole country, which expressed itself in innumerable press 
comments, all strongly condemning the bill. Prof. Felix Dahn, of 
Breslau, published a pamphlet criticising the bill, in which he said: 
It is one of the saddest and most hazardous attempts made in Prussia, or in the 
whole Empire, since Prince Bismarck has been put out of office, and the thought of 
enacting this proposition into a law is depressing. 
The progressive ideas of the year 1848 tended in Bavaria toward a 
necessary improvement of school education, which resulted in an 
increase in the teacher’s salary. Before this time the schoolhouse 
served both for school purposes and as the home of the teacher, who 
had his sleeping quarters in the garret. Afterwards the school build- 
ings were changed into suitable residences and recitation rooms were 
newly erected. 
The normal regulations of May 15, 1887, laid down new principles for 
the training of school teachers. The diet (Landtag) of 1861 expected 
to pass a new law by means of which the entire public school system 
“was to be regulated. Instead of this there was enacted the school- 
endowment law (Schuldotationsgesetz) of November 10, 1861, as the 
first step toward legislation in behalf of the public school, thereby 
regulating external conditions of the school, especially the payment 
and pensioning of teachers.
-P-A-G-E-335
  COMMON SCHOOLS IN BAVARIA. 325 
A few years later, October 31, 1867, a school bill was proposed to the 
diet, in which a general school law was intended, which was to rest on 
the fundamental principles of modern education and statesmanship. 
But the second chamber (Reichsratskammer) refused its sanction, 
believing that the proposed law tended too much toward a diminution 
of the church’s influence as well as containing the germ of the separa- 
tion of the school from the church. The bill assailed especially the 
organization known as the district board of trustees. According to 
article 115 every province (Bavaria is divided into eight provinces, 
Kreise or Regierungsbezirke) should be divided into a certain number 
of districts, and for each district one of the best qualified teachers 
should be appointed by the Government as school inspector. 
Hence, legislation having failed in Bavaria, there are now only a few 
points in the public school system, such as defrayment of the school 
expenditure (Schulaufwand), home relations of teachers, lawful punish- 
ment for neglect, ete., which are regulated by law. School affairs are 
dependent, first, upon a number of ministerial resolutions and ordi- 
nances (i. e., such orders as the head of the State, without the coopera- 
tion of the Diet, can make, with ministerial counter signature) which are 
not organically combined, and, second, upon a great number of special 
regulations and orders, issued by the head of the department, by means 
of which, from the beginning of this century up to the present time, the 
public schools were regulated and their management changed from time 
to time. 
As many as 6,857, or 95.3 per cent, of the common schools of the 
Kingdom are found in the country, according to official reports. The 
present description relates principally to these schools in the seven 
contiguous provinces of Bavaria, for in the Bavarian Palatinate, which 
yet retains many laws and civil institutions peculiar to itself from the 
former French rule, there are also some peculiarities in the school sys- 
tem. The city schools of Munich have been governed by a local ordi- 
nance since January 1, 1872, known as the “Schulstatut” of Munich. 
This report would become too extensive if the Munich city school 
system were considered. 
Before the Reformation there were no municipal schools. The edu- 
cation of the young lay entirely in the hands of priests and monks. 
The State for the first time entered into school matters in 1548, under 
Duke William IV, who in that year issued the first school ordinances 
of Bavaria. A real separation between the German and Latin school 
system had not yet taken place. For the first time in a voluminous 
school law of the year 1569 the Latin and German schools became 
officially separated in the principalities of Upper and Lower Bavaria. 
Also, in 1659, under Ferdinand Maria (1651-1679), there appeared a reg- 
ulation for school discipline for both German and Latin teachers and 
pupils. A more extensive and effectual organization, which touched 
upon the true relationship of schooland state, came into existence with
-P-A-G-E-336
    326 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
and took the form of the Bavarian common school system (Volksschule) 
during the reign of Elector Max Joseph HI (1745-1777). Influential 
men of this period of reorganization were Freiherr Adam von Tokstiitt 
and the Benedictine friar Heinrich Brarun, whose convent was in 
Tegernsee. He prepared, in obedience to the wish of the elector, the 
school plan (Schulplan) of 1770. The real fundamental document for 
the purpose of newly organizing the public school system may be con- 
sidered to be the ordinance of December 13, 1802, by means of which 
compulsory education during the age from 6 to 12 years and an exami- 
nation at leaving the school were established. An order was issued in 
the following year for children to attend Sunday and holiday schools 
during the age from 12 to 18. Bavaria was one of the first German 
States to establish Sunday schools. (See p. 331.) 
During the years from 1804 to 1806 a plan of instruction was issued 
for elementary schools, both in the country and in the cities, but this 
plan far exceeded all possibilities of carrying it into effect. The new 
edition of this plan, published in 1811, was drawn up in six sections; 
in the first division the real purpose of school education was expressed ; 
the second provided for an institution for the training of teachers, and 
contains both general and special regulations and maxims; the third 
division, which was added in 1810, contained a more particular defini- 
tion of the teacher’s duties in the three different grades of the school. 
As regards the arrangement of the matter of instruction, the plan 
depends upon thre ideas of Pestalozzi; as regards the mode of teaching, 
upon those of Basedow. But if we go into particulars, there may be 
found traces of almost all the numerous school reformers of that age. 
The entire plan is an example of pedagogical eclecticism. The require- 
ment of the kind and number of subjects to be taught is quit exact. 
For the first grade were prescribed the most important subjects, includ- 
ing the three leading principles, viz, “God, language, number and. 
measure”—that is, religious instruction, reading, writing, and arith- 
metic. In the second grade were added the subjects conducive to the 
public good, so called because a certain knowledge and skill in these 
is necessary for most purposes and advantages in various callings of 
life. This course contained the three subjects, ‘man, nature, and art,” 
represented by history, geography, and natural history, as well as 
drawing and regular exercises in singing. 
In 1856 seven years of attendance in the public school was made 
general, It was then declared that the matter prescribed for the pub- 
lie school should not be increased, for the extension of the school term 
was intended only for a better training in the branches already pre- 
scribed. 
At present the above general school plan, which yet serves as the 
basis of instruction in the public schools, has been replaced by other 
special plans, which, during the last twenty years, have been prescribed 
for separate provinces (Kreislehrpliine), They adhere without excep-
-P-A-G-E-337
COMMON SCHOOLS IN BAVARIA, 327 
  tion to the inductive method and the principle of concentration in the 
matter of instruction. 
Instruction in the natural sciences must depend entirely upon the 
established text-book. Nearly all the provincial plans begin geograph- 
ical instruction as a continuation of the first three years’ instruction in 
object lessons and local geography, taking up the regular study of 
geography in the fourth school year. In some provinces instruction in 
history begins in the fourth school year, in some in the fifth, and 
still others in the sixth. Instruction in natural history, which is 
really begun in the form of object lessons during the first three school 
years, is generally taken up as a regular study during the fourth 
school year. Physics is mostly assigned to the last three years of 
the course. Singing exercises are given regularly. The songs prac- 
ticed are partly juvenile, popular and national, and partly religious 
songs, which are learned by ear, and, if possible, from notes. Munich 
has a central singing school with a three years’ course of four les- 
sons a week. Drawing is taught in several provinces (Ober und 
Unterfranken) as an optional subject; in others (Oberpfalz) this study 
is made obligatory. The provincial plans intend to make gymnastics 
general and games (Jugendturnspiele) are encouraged. For the city 
schools of Munich gymnastics were made obligatory, according to 
article 5 of the city school statute of 1871, for both girls and boys. The 
schools of Munich have had a separate plan since 1871, which was 
changed and amended in 1872 and 1880. This city school course 
requires high attainments. 
Every country school in Bavaria must have its own special school 
garden for the purpose of giving instruction in gardening and planting. 
In most of the provinces instruction in female handiwork is required, 
for which a female teacher is employed. 
The Kingdom of Bavaria had in 1892-93 as many as 7,492 school 
buildings, in which there were 13,688 school or recitation rooms. 
(a) In the ordinary schools (Werktagesschulen): 822,175 pupils; 
402,990, or 49 per cent, male; 419,185, or 51 per cent, female; 143,825 
in the cities; 678,350 in the country. 
(b) In the holiday schools: 314,605 pupils; 139,036, or 42.2 per cent, 
boys; 175,569, or 55.8 per cent, girls; 36,372 in the cities; 278.233 in

Saxony Wiirtember, 
  By an edict of September 5, 1868, the school boards were newly 
organized. Their decisions were made dependent upon the department 
of the interior (Ministerium des Innern), section for public educa- 
tional institutions and training schools. The provincial governments 
(Kreisregierungen), with their school superintendents (Kreisschulriite), 
were appointed to become intermediate agencies, and into their charge 
was given the supervision of the district boards and local trustees. 
According to a resolution of the Diet of 1825, the office of provincial 
school superintendent was abolished, and in its place a pedagogical 
advisory board for every province was appointed (Kreisscholarchat). 
This board consists in every province of four Kreisscholarchen and 
two assistants, who are appointed from among the leading professors, 
inspectors, and teachers. They attend the meetings of the provincial 
government when leading questions of public instruction are discussed 
and decided, and they perform their functions without pay. 
The department of educational and ecclesiastical affairs (Ministe- 
rium fiir Kirchen- und Schulangelegenheiten) was established Febru- 
ary 27, 1847, and even to-day it exercises legislative as well as executive 
power over the school system of the Kingdom. For the common school 
system a councilor is appointed (kéniglicher Ober-Regierungsrat). 
The department has the right of proposing school laws and ordinances 
and of issuing executive instructions or granting permission to use cer- 
tain text-books and other material for the public and normal schools. 
It has the right of proposing measures to be adopted by the King regard- 
ing the removal of the Kreisscholarchen, provincial inspectors, and 
teachers in the normal schools (Schullehrseminarien). It also has the 
management of the funds for institutions of learning and of that of 
the establishment for the publication of text-books. This latter insti- 
tution was founded in 1785 with the purpose of printing and publish- 
ing uniform schoolbooks and furnishing cheap stationery and such 
other articles as are necessary for supplying the schools without creat- 
ing a monopoly. At present the publication is not done by the Gov- 
ernment, but since January 1, 1874, has been leased to R. Oldenbourg, 
in Munich. The books prepared by this establishment are not allowed 
to be used in the public schools unless the department has approved 
them. The use of slates and copy books ruled crosswise is prohibited 
because injurious to the eyes. On this account drawing lessons accord- 
ing to the “stygmographic” method must not be given, and the using 
of colored pencils on slates is not allowed on account of the danger of 
poisoning.

  COMMON SCHOOLS IN BAVARIA. 329 
The supervisicn of all the schools of a province is in the hands of the 
provincial government, the department of the interior. The manage- 
ment of school affairs is generally transferred to a governmental coun- 
cilor (Kreisschulreferent), who represents the provincial government in 
all technical questions concerning the common school system. Since 
1873 a teacher has acted as county school inspector (Kreisschulin- 
spector) for each province, and some provinces have two or three. 
To the duties of the provincial government belong the preparation 
of a provincial course of instruction; the issuing.of orders and regu- 
lations (these are executive instructions and orders based upon existing 
laws, ordinances, and general decrees of the department) ; the establish- 
ment of school districts and schools proper; the visiting of the schools; 
the superintendence of the normal schools; the appointment, discharge, 
and pensioning of teachers; the holding of state examinations (Anstel- 
lungspriifungen) of teachers, and the appointing of district inspectors 
(Districtsschulinspectoren), These immediate assistants of the pro- 
vincial governments are, as a rule, taken from the Catholic or Protestant 
clergy. Their business is to oversee the several schools in their dis- 
tricts and to watch the conduct of the local trustees (Lokalschulin- 
spectoren) and teachers. The district school inspector has to make one 
official visit to each school every year. It is also his duty to release 
those pupils from school who have passed the age of compulsory attend- 
ance. This examination generally takes place in the country schools at 
the end of the winter term (March or April). In the so-called “imme- 
diate” cities, 50 in number (these are cities which are subordinated, not 
to the district administration, but to that of the provincial government), 
the power of district trustees is intrusted to a city school commission. 
For the next lower directing power there is in every school ward (Schul- 
sprengel) a local board (Lokalschulinspection), whose chairman is a 
clergyman (Lokalschulinspector). The membership consists ‘of the 
mayor and two or three delegates of the community. In the Palati- 
nate the mayor is chairman. : 
The supervision of instruction is entirely within the hands of the 
local school inspector. The local board must see to it at the begin- 
ning of each school year that all the pupils are supplied with the 
adopted schoolbooks and stationery. For poor children the local 
charity board supplies the means for such necessities. The school 
inspector is chairman of the local board, and he determines the date 
of the monthly meetings of the local school board, which principally 
occupies its time with cases of neglect of school. The parents, foster 
parents, tutors, or masters of those failing in attendance in either the 
week-day or Sunday schools are summoned to appear before this board, 
and when the excuses are found to be insufficient (i. e., if the absence is 
not caused by sickness, storm, death in family, ete.) the case is ready for 
action. The first time the offending party is simply warned, but for 
each subsequent neglect during that year there is a fine imposed of  
-P-A-G-E-340
  aera EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
from 10 to 50 pfennigs for each day of absence. If the absence without 
sufficient cause is prolonged, the case is reported to the eivil court 
(Amtsgericht) and punished according to the higher law with a pen- 
alty of imprisonment not to exceed eight days or with a payment to 
the extent of 45 marks ($10 to $11). 
Obligatory school attendance begins for both boys and girls with 
the completed sixth year of age and regularly covers ten years, seven 
years in the day school (Werktagsschule) and three in the Sunday 
school. The compulsory law includes not only the native-born chil- 
dren, but also foreign-born children (without regard to nationality) who 
are living in Bavaria during school age. The causes that may release 
children from compulsory attendance are— 
(a) Private instruction (with permission from the local trustees). 
(b) Attendance in a higher public institution of learning or a school 
for abnormal children. 
In order to establish any private institution which is intended to 
replace, either entirely or in part, the regular public school, permission 
must first be obtained. This permission is granted by the district trus- 
tees, in whose hands rests the supervision of private schools, and who 
must see that they conform to law. Among 7,173 day schools there 
were in 1891-92 only 52 private schools. : 
In order that children not old enough to attend the public schools 
may receive shelter, support, and care, public nurseries (Kleinkinder- 
bewahranstalten) have been established in cities and in the country. 
Kindergartens are found in the larger cities for children from 3 to 6 
years of age. Asylums for those of a more tender age, from 1 to 3 
years, exist in manufacturing towns, and are called Krippen. 
In 1891 the number of private nurseries for small children was 179; 
the number of public nurseries during the same year was 34. The kin- 
dergarten is not permitted to become a substitute for the public school; 
it is not organically united with the elementary school; it can neither 
give lessons as in the public school nor otherwise encroach upon the 
public school work; it is unconditionally forbidden to give instruction 
in reading, writing, and arithmetic. The manner of occupation is so 
arranged that the children are continually employed at play. Both 
State and community are awaiting results from the kindergarten. 
in certain cities there are also institutions, ‘ Knaben- und Miidchen- 
horte,” which give to children during vacation suitable employment 
and maintenance and keep them under control; also manual and trade 
schools for boys (Schiiler-Werkstiitte) are established. During the 
school year 1893-94 there were 42 boys and 37 girls attending this class 
of institutions. The department of the interior has power to decide 
concerning the introduction of convent schools. Moreover, such schools 
can not be established without the consent of the people in the commu- 
nity where they are to be located. In the year 1891-92 there were 
among 13,501 professional teachers 29 monks and 978 nuns. Nuns as

teachers have to fulfill certain prescribed conditions in order to enter 
upon public school work. No woman can be appointed a public teacher 
unless unmarried. ‘ 
Pupils who have finished the fourth public school grade may under- 
take an examination for the “ Lateinschule” and “ Realschule.” After 
a six years’ course in the “ Realschule” and two in the “ Industrie- 
schule” comes the “ Polytechnicum.” The “Lateinschule” has a course 
of five years, immediately following which is the “Gymnasium,” with 
four grades, A certificate showing thatthe candidate has completed 
the course in the latter institution authorizes the bearer to enter the 
university. He who has passed the examinations in the first three 
classes of the ‘“ Lateinschule” can enter the “ Realgymnasium,” and 
after having completed the course of six years and passed the exami- 
nation called “Absolutorium” has-the right to enter the ‘“ Polytech- 
nicum.” 
After seven years’ attendance in the common schools and a successful 
examination, the releasing of the pupil from the public school takes 
place. Pupils who in examination do not show sufficient attainments, 
especially if they were negligent in their attendance, can be required 
to remain in school another year. In order to be released from the 
Sunday and holiday school, each one must also first attain a certain 
standing in the annual examinations. The two hours’ instruction on 
Sundays and holidays is, as a rule, held during the early hours of the 
afternoon. One-third of the time is given to grammar of the mother 
tongue, one-third to arithmetic, and one-third to nature studies. For 
written exercises the use of slates is forbidden. Religious instruction 
is given in the church by the clergy. All persons of the age requiring 
the attendance at Sunday school are compelled to be present. In place 
of the boys’ holiday school, Munich has maintained since 1877 an 
industrial continuation school (gewerbliche Fortbildungsschule) of nine 
exercises per week, each lasting an hour. 
The Bavarian common school houses are, as a rule, built and fur- 
nished to accommodate the children of parents of the ruling religious 
belief. The religious character of the schools is, as a rule, preserved. 
According to a ministerial ordinance, however, issued August 26, 1893, 
there may be established in extraordinary cases schools of mixed relig- 
ious faith (Simultanschulen). The school statistics of the year 1891-92 
show that there are 134 of such mixed schools among 7,225 common 
schools. 
The school year in rural schools commences with the beginning of 
the summer term, generally on the 1st of May; in city schools with the 
beginning of the winter term, usually on the 1st or 15th of September. 
The beginning and the end of the vacation are different in the several 
provinces. The vacation lasts from four to eight weeks. In every week 
of the school year there are two afternoons free, generally on Wednes- 
days and Saturdays. On account of local circumstances, an entire day 
   
-P-A-G-E-342
  332 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
(Saturday) may be given free. The instruction lasts five or six hours 
a day, three in the forenoon and two in the afternoon. In the country 
the school hours during the summer are in the forenoon, and do not 
- exceed four hours. In the cities the arrangement of the school hours 
is the same throughout all the seasons. In Munich the hours in the 
forenoon are from 8 to 12 o’clock, in the afternoon from 2 to 4; the first 
(lowest) grade has twenty-three hours per week, the seventh thirty- 
two. If during the hot season of the year the daily temperature stands 
at 77°F. in the shade, the school hours are limited to the forenoon. 
School discipline is left entirely in the hands of the teacher. He 
determines upon and administers the punishment, and is answerable 
for any excess of punishment. For the prevention of common mis- 
demeanors and offenses and their punishment, there are brought into 
effect warning, threatening (before the class), reproofs (in private or 
before the school), and unfavorable report (the report makes known to 
parents or guardians the standing of their children: I, very good; II, 
good; III, satisfactory; IV, unsatisfactory. Further punishments are, 
standing on the floor, placing the offender for a time.on a special- 
punishment seat, setting of tasks that must be prepared at home, keep- 
ing indoors during intermission without luncheon (under supervision). 
For grosser offenses which imply wickedness of heart, for persistent 
laziness which has not yielded to other methods, and especially for mis- 
leading other pupils, corporal punishment is made use of. For this the 
instrument is a rod or a switch. All other forms of chastisement, such 
as boxing the ears or slapping and striking on the head, shaking by 
the hair, pulling the ears, ete., are strictly forbidden. Visiting beer 
gardens and theatrical entertainments is for school children only per- 
mitted when under the supervision of those to whom they belong. 
Attending balls (either for dancing or looking on) is unconditionally 
and without exception forbidden for children during their attendance 
in the week-day and Sunday schools. Gambling for money and the 
use of tobacco are also prohibited. 
Article 1 of the aforementioned school-endowment law of November 
10, 1861, defines the common schools as local institutions (Gemeindean- 
stalten). Mr. Seydel, of Munich, however, defines them as State insti- 
tutions. Serving in the public school is serving the State, and not 
merely a locality. The common schools are from every standpoint goy- 
ernmental institutions. The State regulates the training, appointment, 
and pensioning of teachers; it controls school supervision by means of 
its trustees, levies and collects the school taxes, provides for the estab- 
lishment of new schools, and arranges the instruction. The State con- 
cerns itself with those interests only which the communities hold in 
common in the matter of State administration of the common school 
system, to the extent that it grants to them a representation in the 
local school boards and yields to them the selection of teachers to be 
appointed. In former imperial cities (Freie Reichstidte) the candi-

  dates’ names were presented to the provincial government for decision. 
The legal relation of the community to the public school is not in the 
sphere of management, but of finances. The obligation of defraying 
the school expenditure (p. 332), the means needed for establishing and 
maintaining schools, rests on the community in which the school is 
located. According to the endowment law, the communities overbur- 
dened by assessments received support from ‘the State or the provin- 
cial funds. 
If the number of pupils in a common school under one teacher exceeds 
an average of 100 for five years, the community may be required to 
establish a position for a second teacher. In Munich the maximum 
number of pupils in a single class is limited to 60. 
The school superintendents, in cooperation with the provincial gov- 
ernments, determine the architecture and plans of the new school build- 
ings. The permission for carrying out the project must be granted by 
the provincial government. ‘The same is also the case concerning the 
remodeling of existing school buildings. In making plans for the erec- 
tion of new schoolhouses the locality is especially considered. For each 
child at least 2 cubic meters of air are required. The heating should 
be so regulated that the temperature during school hours will not fall 
below 59° F. The community has to see to the heating and cleaning of 
the schoolrooms. 
In order to increase and facilitate the use of the best objects and 
appliances for school and teaching, there has been since 1875 in 
Munich the “Kreislehrmittelmagazin.” This pedagogical museum has 
been more fortunate than the “Permanente Lehrmittelausstellung” 
in Vienna, which was founded about the same time (1872), or the 
“Museo d’Istruzione e d’Educazione” in Rome, which was opened in 
1874 after the same plan by Bonghi. Both of these institutions have 
been abandoned. 
The instructors in the public schools are divided into: (1) Regular 
teachers (wirkliche Schullehrer). These are appointed to regular life 
positions and receive salaries prescribed by law. They have not the 
same rights which State officials have, but they can be removed only 
for cause or disability. (2) Temporary teachers (Schulverweser), who 
without further legal title are either placed in charge of a school 
instead of a regular teacher or occupy some vacant position tempo- 
rarily. (3) School assistants (Schulgehilfen) are those who have to 
give instruction under direction of a regular teacher, who stands 
responsible for their conduct. 
A definite position can be entered upon in about four or five years 
after passing the State examination; consequently, eight or nine years 
after graduation from the normal school. Application for appointment 
and change of position has to be presented to the provincial govern- 
ment by the district trustees. The appointment, as a rule, is to a place 
within the province, but teachers, as well as other civil officers of the
-P-A-G-E-344
  334 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
State, can petition for suitable positions in any part of the Kingdom. 
On account of the public nature of the service which teachers perform, 
they are protected by articles 196 and 232 of the national penal code, 
which secures those serving the State against violence, insult, or slan- 
der concerning the performance of their duties. Injuries which a 
teacher may receive in the discharge of his duty the community con- 
cerned must make good when the damage can not be repaid by any 
other means. The regular teachers, by virtue of the law concerning © 
home, marriage, and residence, acquire with their appointment the right 
of citizenship in the community where their school is located. 
A teacher in active service can not be elected to the office of mayor 
(Biirgermeister). He is free from being called upon to act in the capacity 
of justice of the peace or juror (Schéffe or Geschworne). He may 
accept election to the city council (Gemeindebevollmichtichter) and be 
appointed district or provincial councilor (Distrikts or Landrat). There 
are many cases in which teachers occupy such offices. At present four 
common school teachers are members of the Bavarian Chamber of Dep- 
uties; the German Reichstag also has four members who are elementary 
teachers. 
Teachers subjected to military service are mustered into the infantry, 
the first year for ten weeks, the second for six, and the third for four 
weeks. In Bavaria, since 1886, a certificate for one year’s voluntary 
service at their own expense is given after passing the last examination 
in a normal school, 
If the teacher wishes to marry, he must apply to the provingial gov- 
ernment for an official permit. For the performance of any outside 
duties for which a teacher is paid (as organist in a church, local secre- 
tary, agent, or postmaster, etc.) official permission must first be secured 
from the district trustees. Such employments as carrying on beer 
saloons, retail shops, and the like, are expressly pronounced as inadmis- 
sible to the position of a public school teacher, even if such a business 
is in his own dwelling, outside of the locality of the school, and 
intended to be carried on by his wife or children; service in the office 
of trustee, as attorneys, notaries, etc., is inadmissible. 
The State authorities are the only ones who can pronounce judgment 
against teachers. The local trustees can warn and the district trustees 
can reprove, but the provincial government alone can pass judgment 
on the removal to a less lucrative position, or decide upon dismissal. 
For fifty years of service the medal of honor (Ludwigsorden) is con- 
ferred upon the teacher. Particularly praiseworthy and serviceable 
activity is acknowledged by bestowing the silver or gold medal bearing 
the service cross of the Bavarian crown. Since 1887 teachers have 
received the service cross or service medal of the order of St. Michael. 
The minimum income of teachers in communities with less than 2,500 
inhabitants amounts, for instance, in Upper Bavaria, to 880 marks; in 
more thickly inhabited communities to 1,000 marks. After 5,10, 13, 16,
-P-A-G-E-345
  
COMMON SCHOOLS IN BAVARIA. 335 
20, 25, ete., years after leaving the normal school an increase of 90 marks 
at each interval is paid by the State from the service fund, so that a 
teacher, after serving twenty years, has an addition from the Govern- 
ment of 450 marks. In communities with less than 2,500 inhabitants a 
dwelling with apartments suitable for a family, is to be furnished to 
the teacher. 
Tuition fees (Schulgeld), which constitute a regular source of income 
of the teacher, are to be paid for all in the community who are sub- 
ject to attendance in school. The tuition fee amounts to 76 pfennigs 
for a pupil in the week-day school, 25 pfennigs for one in the Sunday 
school, for three months, which is equal to about 75 and 25 cents a year, 
respectively. In many communities the tuition fee has ceased and is 
replaced from the local treasury by means of a tax assessment. That 
part of the teacher’s salary which comes from the community, in cases 
where monthly payment is not prescribed, is paid, as a rule, quarterly, 
like the tuition fee. In the large cities the teachers receive better 
salaries. A teacher’s income after twenty years’ service amounts (with- 
out the addition from the Government of 450 marks) in Wiirzburg to 
2,760 marks, in Munich to 2,700 marks, in Nuremberg to 2,550 marks. 
Leave of absence for more than a week is given by the provincial 
government. If mutual assistance among the teachers in the same 
community, in case of sickness, for instance, is not practicable, the pro- 
vincial government must appoint a school assistant, whose support is 
to be procured by means of contributions from provincial funds. A 
teacher on sick leave receives his full salary for at least half a year. 
Since length of service does not in itself entitle teachers to a pension 
who on account of some unavoidable disability can not pursue their 
calling, there has been established by law in every province a pension 
union (Gesetzlicher Verein fiir Pensionierung des Lehrpersonals an den 
deutschen Volks-Schulen) which is directed (under supervision of the _ 
provincial government) by members of the union. The union receives 
donations and yearly contributions from State and provincial funds. 
All teachers are subject to assessments for pension purposes. The 
initiation fee and the yearly dues are different in the various provinces; 
for instance, there is to be paid in Lower Bavaria 24 marks initiation 
fee, and 12 marks annually. The amount of pension paid ranges in the 
various provinces from 1,000 to 1,400 marks. Besides this, there are in 
the cities special civil pension bureaus. Hente a pensioned teacher of 
Munich, after a service of twenty-one years, may receive a “yearly 
income of. 1,440 + 915 = 2,355 marks. For the support of widows and 
orphans of deceased teachers there are established societies (Schul- 
Jehrer-Witwen- und Waisenunterstiitzungs-Vereine) which in the dif- 
ferent provinces are differently organized. All teachers have to pay, 
besides 10 per cent of an entire year’s income, an initiation fee of 60 
marks and yearly dues up to 30 marks. These unions receive also 
contributions from the Central Schoolbook Publishing Company. By 
   
-P-A-G-E-346
    336 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
means of this relief society the widows draw an average yearly pen- 
sion of 200 marks; each minor orphan receives one-third or one-fourth 
of the pension of the mother. 
Since 1876 a teacher’s widow obtains from the state treasury a yearly 
income of 180. marks; orphans receive 80 marks each. For the support 
and education of teachers’ orphans an orphans’ foundation (Lehrer- 
Waisenstift), whose property amounts to a million marks, has been 
established by the public school teachers’ union (Bayerischer Volks- 
schullehrer- Verein). Orphans who have neither father nor mother 
receive 54 marks per year; if the mother is alive they receive 26 marks. 
In most provinces the teachers have treasury unions for cases of death 
(Sterbekassevereine). In many places the widows and orphans of 
teachers receive support from a local pension union; in Munich, for 
instance, from the private widows’ and orphans’ aid society (Privat- 
Witwen- und Waisen-Unterstiitzungsverein). The widow of a Munich 
teacher who died in his forty-fifth year, would receive, if she had a 
15-year-old daughter and a 17-year-old son, a yearly income of 2,550 
marks. Such enterprises, of course, can only be carried on with sac- 
rifices; a Munich teacher pays ever year in taxes, dues, and society 
contributions an average of 140 marks, or nearly $40.

  CHAPTER IX. 
EDUCATION IN URUGUAY. 
The Republic of Uruguay, formerly a part of the vice-royalty of 
Spain and subsequently a province of Brazil, declared its independ- 
ence August 25, 1825, which was recognized by the treaty of Monte- 
video, signed August 27, 1828. 
The constitution? for the new Republic was ratified on July 18, 1830. 
The Republic, which had in 1892 a population of 728,447, scattered over 
an area of 72,110 English square miles, is divided into nineteen depart- 
ments or provinces. The department of Montevideo, which has the 
smallest superficial area (256 square miles), has a population of 238,080, 
or nearly one-third of the people of Uruguay. The population to the 
square mile for the whole of Uruguay is 10.1; for Montevideo, 933.9. 
The people consist of many nationalities; 70 per cent are native born; 
the remainder are Spaniards, Italians, French, Brazilians, and Argen- 
tines, with very few French and Germans. 
The earliest traces of education are attributed to the Franciscan 
Brothers, who established a school in Montevideo in 1744, and to the 
Jesuits, who opened the first college, which was closed, however, in 
1767. 
With the advent of the Republic appeared the public school, which 
originated from a decree of May 16, 1827, signed by the governor, who 
ordered the establishment of a school in each of the chief towns of the 
department, and who created a junta, or body of inspectors for such 
schools. In 1831 three public schools had been established in Monte- 
video and two others in the principal towns of that province. In 1839 
this number had increased to six in different parts of the Republic, 
with 400 pupils. 
In the year 1847 an institute for public instruction was created, which 
body established provisional regulations for the governmental schools, 
formulated methods of appointing teachers, and selected classical text-   
  aham French, specialist in the school systems of 
  'Prepared by Miss Frances G

  books. The efforts of this institute or commission, to date of 1831, 
brought about the establishment of 14 public schools (9 for boys and 5 
for girls) with 700 pupils; but, for want of funds, some of these schools 
were closed later. These numbers increased to 19 public schools with 
2,313 pupils in 1862, but the political events of 1863 and 1864 again 
prevented the development of elementary instruction. x 
In 1868 Don Pedro Varela established a Society 1 of Friends of Pop- 
ular Instruction, which had great influence upon the condition of edu- 
cation in Uruguay. In 1877 Sefior Varela, who is considered to be 
the Horace Mann of Uruguay, formulated a general law of education 
by which public instruction was to be greatly centralized. His system 
was based upon the best? types of schools in the United States, and 
his aim was. to follow American methods as far as possible. It was 
through his efforts that various text-books from the United States were 
translated for the use of schools and schoolmasters. According to the 
law of August 24, 1877, elementary education was definitely* organized, 
a general department for the carrying on of public schools was estab- 
lished, and in each province a committee of citizens, serving gratu- 
itously, endeavored to see that the school law was carried out, while a 
school inspector had the direct supervision of s: hools throughout the 
province. 
The Catholic religion is the State‘ religion, and instruction therein is 
obligatory in all schools, but there is toleration of all religious creeds. 
Prior to the presentation of the educational system it may be well to 
state that the Uruguayan authorities have various reform movements on 
the tapis, which may lead to modifications of this presentation within 
the next few years. Following the lead of other countries, some of the 
well-known educators have been investigating developments in peda- 
gogical science on the Continent, and the articles appearing from month 
to month in the “Boletin de Ensefianza Primaria,” organ of the depart- 
ment of public instruction, indicate the introduction of manual and 
physical training—a graduated series of gymnastic exercises—and the 
addition of the kindergarten to the school system. -Whether these 
innovations will become a permanent part of the modus operandiof the 
present system remains to be seen.   
  THE SYSTEM OF EDUCATION. 
Hstablishment.—The school system of Uruguay, established accord- 
ing to a law of 1877, with modifications at later dates, consists of three

grades of schools—elementary,' secondary, and higher (escuelas prima- 
rias, secundarias, y superior)—the lowest grade to be established in 
every locality where there are 50 pupils between 6 and 14 years, the 
limit of school age (edad de la obligacién escolar). Within the past 
two years? kindergartens (jardines de infantes) have been opened as a 
kind of preparatory division for the elementary grades, but to date 
these are very few in number. Education is compulsory and gratuitous 
in precept, although a study of the subject indicates that fees are paid 
in certain schools. Parents and guardians are at liberty to have their 
children educated either in public or private schools (escuelas publi- 
cas y privadas). The law requires the establishment of normal schools 
(escuelas normales) and school libraries, the giving of pedagogical lec- 
tures,’ and the publishing of a school journal. 
Persons desirous of teaching (aspirantes al titulo de maestros) are 
required to obtain a certificate of qualification (diploma de maestro) 
for such a position except when they are to teach in a private school 
(escuela privada). The programme of study, as required by law, 
includes object lessons, reading, writing, composition, grammar and 
rhetoric, geography, cosmography and history, bookkeeping and bitsi- 
ness rules, the duties of citizenship, arithmetic, elementary algebra 
and geometry, physiology and hygiene, natural history, agriculture, 
drawing, gymnastics, and singing, sewing, cutting of garments, and the 
management of the sewing machine in schools for girls. The secondary 
schoolst aim to complete or supplement the studies of the elementary 
grades, and to prepare for scientific and literary careers, While the 
secondary schools (escuelas secundarias) are free, the examination fees 
for entrance vary from $1 to $2, in accordance with the desire on the 
part of the pupil to take an elective ($1) or obligatory ($2) course of 
study. A completion of the obligatory course entitles to a diploma of 
bachelor of science or letters, on payment of 50 pesos ;> poor students 
have a remission of these fees, however. The higher schools include 
the faculty of law and social sciences, the faculty of medicine and its 
subsidiary branches, faculty of mathematics and its branches. The 
diploma of bachelor of science or letters is required for entrance to these 
university studies except for the study of pharmacy, dentistry, and sur- 
veying; students intending to pursue these studies are required to pass 
an examination. Four dollars is required as an entrance fee for superior 
instruction, and $150 upon obtaining the degree of either of the faculties.

A school of arts and trades and a military school complete the school 
system. 
State control.—The general superintendence of- all the scholastic 
authorities in the Republic is placed in charge of the department of 
public instruction,' which, created in 1877, has for its presiding officer 
a minister of the Government (Ministro de Justicia, Culto é Instruccién 
Publica); for its first vice-president, the national inspector of primary 
instruction (Inspector Nacional de Instruccién Primaria); for its second 
vice-president, the director of the normal school. There are four other 
members appointed by the Government, The duties of both State and 
local school authorities” will be described under Supervision. 
Local controls aids to the State officials are the departmental 
(provincial) school inspectors, and the school committees, who, through 
their reports to the central authorities, keep these State officials 
informed in regard to educational affairs throughout the Republic. 
Maintenance.—The schools are maintained by the Central Government 
and local authorities. The Uruguayans consider the education of the 
masses to be obligatory upon them, hence they set aside a large pro- 
portion of the revenues accruing from custom duties, taxation, ete., for 
the purpose of maintaining enough schools for all practical purposes. 
To be a citizen of the Republic of Uruguay the person must be able to 
read and write. It is intended that the schools of elementary, second- 
ary, and superior grades be free to all, and any individual is at liberty 
to found such? schools, provided authoritative inspection is permitted 
in matters of hygiene, fundamental principles of. law, and morality. 
The State is expected to maintain as many schools of all grades as are 
required to give the proper instruction to the youth of Uruguay.                                                          
          
                
      
          
     
                      
     
      STATISTICS. 
   Uruguay had a population in 1892 of 728,447, an enrollment in ele- 
mentary schools of 67,009, and an average attendance of 51,583; that 
is, the ratio of enrollment in these lower grades to total population is 
9.25; that of average attendance to enrollment is 76.97.

    Of these teachers (personal ensefiante) 1,515 were lay teachers and 
320 belonged to different religious communities. In the public schools 
(escuelas publicas) 638 teachers had diplomas and 241 had none, ‘There 
were 544 Women teachers with diplomas (diplomas de inaestra) and 76 
without; 94 men with diplomas and 165 without. 
Montevideo has a university (Universidad de la Reptblica Oriental 
del Uruguay) and some other institutions? for secondary and higher 
education. The normal school for girls (Iuternato Normal de Seforitas) 
gave certificates in the years 1887-1891 to 143 students who were 
trained for the teacher’s profession. A normal school for boys has 
recently been established. In two years it graduated 44 students,! and it 
had 12 professors in 1892. A school of arts and trades gives gratuitous 
instruction to 163 pupils. Although a State institution, this school is 
actually under the care of the national charity and public beneficence 
commission, and its building is large enough for 600 students. In 1891 
there were 227 students enrolled and 46 professors. 
The course covers ordinary branches to the third grade and carpentry, 
cabinetmaking, shoemaking, bookbinding, typography, lithography,

silver and tin smithing,' telegraphy, drawing, gymnastics, and music. 
A military college has 8 professors,’ and 61 pupils between the ages of 
14 and 18. Many religious seminaries (seminarios) throughout the 
Republic have a considerable number of pupils; indeed, it is stated 
that “more than 4,200! pupils are ‘taught there.” The university at 
Montevideo! had 668 students during the year 1891, thus distributed: 
In law, 337; in: social science, 176; in medicine, 85; in mathematics, 30. 
Of these, 631 were natives and 37 foreigne The professors were 75, 
viz: For law and social science, 14; for medicine, 23; for mathematics, 
19; for preparatory studies, 19. Classed as to nationality, there were 
58 natives, 12 Spaniards, 3 Italians, 1 German, and 1 Frenchman. On 
June 28, 1890, the Government decided to establish a higher school of 
agriculture (escuela superior de agricultura)* for the purpose of 
theoretico-practical study, leading to the title of agricultural expert 
(perito agrénomo). <A special commission, called the “Comisién 
Directiva de la Escuela Superior de Agricultura,” is to have charge of 
the work of this school. 
  FINANCE.* 
Income (recursos).—The Government employs one-ninth of its general 
budget in the cause of elementary education, this proportion reaching 
the sum of about $700,000 per annum; and so great is its desire to 
further the cause of education that it aims to expend still more. 
Elementary, or, as it is usually called, primary education, is, as hereto- 
fore stated, gratuitous and obligatory throughout the Republic, and 
more, the intention is to have the examinations of all grades of public 
schools paid for by the State, which furnishes books and all necessary 
materials for carrying on the schools. The public revenues are derived 
from direct taxes on property, licenses to trade houses, stamped paper, 
stamps, import and export duties, port dues, municipal duties in the 
capital and in the departments or provinces, duties on indirect inher- 
itance, trade patents, etc., the customs duties furnishing the principal 
revenues of the Republic. According to the law of 1879, a general tax 
for school purposes is imposed on householders of cities, industrial 
establishments, banks, and commercial houses, in accordance with the 
income of these persons or establishments. The payments are required 
to be monthly except where the establishments are too far removed 
from a center; then annual payments are allowed. In rural districts a 
similar tax isimposed, and the funds are turned over to the authorities 
of the chief city of the province.

Expenditure (gastos).—Hach department or province is to report the 
annual cost of education, the teachers’ salaries, house rentals (so that 
the proper tax may be imposed), the proportion of the general expendi- 
tures! required for inspection, repair of school buildings, and for pur- 
chase of school apparatus. The expenditure for schools in 1892? is as 
follows: Teachers’ salaries,’ $348,566; rentals, $130,432; incidentals, 
$19,213; administrative purposes, $29,310; school journal, $1,975; com- 
mnittees and inspection, $48,103; kindergartens, $4,263; normal for 
girls, $39,984; normal for boys, $3,420; for the practice school, $4,962; 
library of pedagogical museum, $2,507; inspector’s office, $15,227. 
These amounts, coupled with various incidentals, give a general total 
of $658,276. The cost of education for each pupil enrolled, as stated 
in the “Estadistica Escolar, afio 1892,” is $12.06; for each pupil in 
average attendance, $16.95. In 1891 it was $13.27 for each pupil 
enrolled and $18.29 for each pupil in average attendance. 
SUPERVISION AND ADMINISTRATION,! 
State control.—The general supervision of all the scholastic authori- 
ties in the Republic is exercised by the department of public instruction, 
which, created in 1877, has for its presiding officer a minister of the 
Government; for its first vice-president, the national inspector of pri- 
mary instruction (inspector nacional de instruccién primaria), who is 
expected to visit the schools of the chief cities and towns at least once 
a year; for its second vice-president, the director of the normal school. 
Then there are four other members appointed by the Government. 
The department‘ of public instruction (direccién general de instrue- 
cibn piiblica) has general direction of primary instruction throughout 
the Republic. It takes charge of the administration and direction of 
the normal school or schools; it supervises the different departmental 
inspectors,’ suggesting the best text-books to be used in the schools; 
it presents the diplomas of the three different grades in accordance 
with the results of the examinations; it formulates the school pro- 
grammes, and suggests the best means of reforms in educational mat- 
ters. ‘The technical® inspector of primary education (inspector técnico 
de ensefianza primaria), whose jurisdiction extends through all proy- 
ine s, has for his special functions the visiting of public cen colse to

The Uruguayan unit of money, the peso, is equivalent to 96.5 cenis, hence is 
reckoned at $1.

affairs until 1884, when a ministry of justice, worship, and public instruction was 
created.

study methods of instruction, to suggest to the teachers how greater 
uniformity can be brought about, to organize and preside over teachers’ 
meetings, to keep the department of public instruction (direccién ge- 
neral de instruccion ptiblica) informed as to organization of schools and 
need of school apparatus, to present to the department, in accord with 
the national inspector (inspector nacional de instruccién primaria), a 
report on the condition of schools visited, and to present a private 
report in regard to teachers and their aptitude for the position held. 
Local control..—Each department or province has a salaried school 
inspector (inspector departamental), and a committee of citizens (comi- 
sin departamental) serving gratuitously, to superintend local educa- 
tional affairs. The departmental inspector has for his special duties to 
ascertain the school population and enrollment of his special division 
of the Republic; to obtain accurate information in regard to the school 
buildings, rentals, expenditures, etc.; to preside at teachers’ confer- 
ences, and to keep the national inspector informed as to the condition 
of education in his vicinity. He is aided by the local committee, which 
visits the schools even oftener than the inspector is expected to do. 
This committee aids him in keeping a chronological record of school 
affairs. The local officials (inspectores departamentales y comisiones 
departamentales) see that the orders of the central administration are 
carried out as regards the distribution of school material, text-books, 
ete. The committee makes its report every fifteen days to the depart- 
mental inspector, and he in turn reports each trimester in regard to 
the progress or needs of the schools. The aim of the local officials is 
to further the cause of education as far as it is within their power. 
During the year 1892 the number of visits made by these officials was 
2,678; the number of hours given to such work, 7,464; the cost of visits 
(including railroad, steamboat, and other expenses), $8,035. 
The supervision of secondary and superior” instruction (instruccién 
secundaria y superior) is regulated as follows: A council for second- 
ary and superior instruction (consejo de instruccién secundaria y 
superior) has for its presiding officer the official in charge of education 
in the ministry of justice, worship, and public instruction; for its vice- 
president (usually acting as president) the rector of the university 
(rector de la universidad). Its members consist of the deans of the 
secondary sections and of the university faculties (decanos de la sec- 
ci6n de ensefianza secundaria y de las facultades de la universidad), 
and an equal number of members elected by a majority of votes, by 
citizens registered in the university, or universities, who have the 
degrees of licentiate or doctor, provided such persons are approved by 
the executive power. These last-mentioned members must be citizens 
of at least 25 years of age. The length of term is four years. The

duties of the council for secondary and superior instruction (consejo 
de instruccién secundaria y superior) are to formulate general regula- 
tions for secondary schools; to approve the university regulations; to 
regulate university rentals, and to suggest to the executive power the 
amounts of annual expenditures; to organize the faculties, and to 
determine conditions of admission for other universities; to organize a 
body of professors for secondary and superior instruction for the pur- 
pose of filling vacancies; to arrange for the inspection of private insti- 
tutions; to see that the regulations (arranged by law) are carried out; 
to formulate special regulations for private establishments, so that the 
studies may tend toward the courses of public secondary and superior 
institutions. 
TEACHERS.! 
Preparation and examinations.—By law of 1877 normal schools, one 
for each sex, were to be established in Montevideo for the proper 
training of a corps of persons to fill the position of teacher wherever 
required. By that law and by a later one of 1882, each province was 
to be allowed to send three persons to the normal school, providing 
such persons had successfully accomplished the studies of the sixth 
grade of an elementary school, and, if a woman, she must have reached 
the thirteenth year of age; if a man, the sixteenth year of age. These 
special regulations, decrees of January 26, 1882, also required the physi- 
eal condition to be excellent and required certificates of the provincial 
committee on education stating the nationality of the persons desiring 
to enter the normal schools, the nationality, profession, and residence 
of parents. 
In order to appear for the examinations leading to a diploma gen- 
eral regulations required women to have passed the sixteenth year and 
men the eighteenth. Ten pesos a month and 10 for admission were to 
be guaranteed for each student, and a stay of one year in the normal 
was requisite except in case of illness. In the normal for girls? (inter- 
nato normal de sefioritas), established in the early part of 1882, there 
are both day and boarding pupils. A practice schcol (escuela de 
aplicacién) is connected with this institution. According to a decree 
of March 30, 1889, no man over 21 years of age will be allowed to enter 
a normal school and no woman over 23 years of age. 
As soon as the normal student has obtained the teacher’s diploma 
of the first grade (diploma de maestro de primer grado) he (or she) is 
expected to return to the department or province from which sent to 
serve as teacher, unless by special request he be allowed to continue

the studies for the diploma entitling him to teach in the second grade! 
(diploma de maestro de secundo grado). If the student leaves the 
normal school prior to the close of a year of study he must forfeit 150 
pesosif he be a boarder, and one-half of that sum if he be a day pupil. 
The length of the normal course, decree of March 30, 1889, is two 
years, in order to obtain the diploma of a first-grade teacher, and of 
three years for the women and two for the men who desire the diploma 
permitting them to teach in the second grade. The graduates are 
expected to teach at least two years; if not, there must be remittal of 
funds to the State in the following proportions: 10 pesos for day pupils 
- for every month under instruction in the normal, and 30 pesos for 
boarding pupils. 
Classified according to diplomas,’ in 1892 there were 363 certificated 
teachers of the first grade; women with diplomas, 544; without diplo- 
mas, 165. The reason of this lack of certificated teachers was stated 
to be on account of overpressure of work among the departmental com- 
mittees (comisiones departamentales), and the employment ad interim 
of many men who had not for this reason, or for lack of preparation, 
passed the requisite examinations. Special courses in pedagogy® are 
given in some institutions for the benefit of persons desiring to be 
teachers, but who are not situated so as to attend normal schools. 
Appointment.—The department of public instruction (direecién 
general de instrucci6n publica) has the appointing power of teachers 
after public competition for the position, but in case of a lack of teach- 
ers having normal school diplomas the departmental committees (comi- 
siones 6 sub-comisiones de instruccién pttblica) may appoint well trained 
persons to the positions provisionally. Assistant teachers receive their 
appointments either through the central department of public instrue- 
tion or through the local authorities. .A teacher’s certificate is not 
necessary in private‘ schools. 
Salaries.—Teachers* in public schools are paid by the State; in pri- 
vate schools they are paid by private individuals or associations. The 
average pay® of teachers is $35.91 a month. The assistants of the first 
grade, $21 to $25; those of the second grade, $28 to $31.66; the direct- 
ors of the first grade, from $40 to $56; those of the second grade, $40 
to $63, and as high as $90 for those of the third grade. Lodging! is 
also furnished to teachers, and when possible in direct connection with 
the school building, or as near as possible to the post of duty. The

  Teachers’ institutes.—In accordance with a law of May 6, 1881, these 
pedagogical conferences (conferencias pedagégicas) are to be held annu- 
ally, from the 5th to the 16th of June, in the capital of each province 
or department. They are for the benefit of both rural and urban 
teachers. The evenings are to be devoted to the theoretical part, that 
is, to discussions as to best methods,’ ete. All teachers of the city are 
expected to be present at these meetings, so that there may be an 
interchange of thought between the urban and rural teachers. 
During the daytime visits are to be made to the schools of the city, 
and the inspectors and teachers are to carry on a programme in accord- 
ance with the discussions of the evening sessions, thus having a series - 
of object lessons. The committees, departmental inspectors, and some- 
times members of the central administration of public instruction aim 
to be present to conduct the discussions. Prizes are to be given annu- 
ally to those who have shown the greatest amount of thought and study 
along the lines designated. The first prize isa diploma of honor, which 
admits of drawing 40 pesos from the treasury. The second prize is 
considered as equivalent to an “accesit.” The department of public 
instruction also calls together its inspectors of primary instruction 
and they form a “ Congreso de Inspectores de Instruccién Primaria” 
for the discussion of better school methods, hours of study in summer - 
and winter, extension of programmes, etc.

COURSES OF STUDY.! 
  Within the last two years, 1890-1892, the effort has been made to have 
the kindergarten? precede the elementary grades in the school system 
of Uruguay, but very few such schools are yet in existence. 
In the elementary grades the pupils have in the first or lowest class, 
reading, phonetics, formation of words, arithmetic, object lessons con- 
cerning color, plants, animals, parts of the body, relative position of 
objects, ete.; drawing, combination of points’and lines; daily singing of 
melodies; the scale; physical exercises,? marching and simple move- 
ments; penmanship; moral teachings in form of short narratives; culti- 
vation of fundamental systematic habits, truthfulness, obedience, selt- 
reliance; Christian doctrine. 
In the second and third classes there is a continuation of the same 
studies with steady advancement toward the fourth class, where the 
elements of geography are added. In the fifth class there is revision 
of previous studies and a continuation of the same, while needlework 
is added for the girls. Grammar and composition are found in the sixth 
class, also mental and written arithmetic; geography showing the form 
of the earth, its magnitude and grand divisions, with physical and de- 
scriptive geography; the object lessons tend toward elemeutary geom- 
etry, physiology, and nutrition. Zoology, with fourteen subdivisions, 
botany, mineralogy, drawing (geometric), are added to the earlier 
branches, and the girls commence instruction on the sewing machine. 
The seventh class continues the branches of the preceding years and 
adds domestic economy for girls. With the eighth class comes history, 
as far as it appertains to the South American countries, and astudy of 
the constitution; the elements of scientific study lead the student into 
physics, astronomy, and plane geometry, always with a continuation of 
the studies of the preceding years.

‘A report was made upon these schools by Dona Enriqueta Compte y Rique, who 
ated the subject in Europe, and who has been appointed as directress of 
such schools. In the four classes of the kindergarten the aim is to train children 
between 3 and 7 years of age, to have progressive exercises from class to class. A 
mixed class is to include children from 8 to 6 years of age, who come in during the 
term, and who, by degrees, are prepared to enter one of the other classes. The 
class for children from 6 to 7 years of age is to be preparatory to the lowest grade 
of the elementary school, 
*¥In 1892 the technical inspector of primary instruction suggested a graduated 
series of gymnastic exercises for the public schools of Uruguay. Fifty-one move- 
‘nents were given, a classification according to sex and age beimg noticeable, Chil- 
dren from 6 to 9 years of age are to have Nos. 1 to 20, inclusive; girls from 10 to 14 
years extend the exercises through No. 38; boys from 10-to 14 take the whole 51 exer- 
cises (These exercises are described in Boletin de Ensefanza Primaria, August, 1892, 
pp: 98-117.)

In the ninth class geography and history tend toward a knowledge 
of the other divisions of the earth’s surface—the voyage of Columbus 
is referred to and a chronological review of the Spanish rulers, with the 
wars for independence against the Spaniards, is given; the scientific 
branches cover mechanics and meteorology, and the term moral teach- 
ings includes duties to the family, to society, and toward the governing 
powers. The tenth class leads the pupil on to rhetoric, with application 
to practical exercises; algebra and geometry; bookkeeping; physics 
(ineluding optics, magnetism, and electricity) ; history, extending to the 
Greeks, the reforms brought about by religious wars, the French revo- 
lution, unity of Germany and Italy; advanced study in physical geog- 
raphy, with illustrative diagrams; advanced astronomy ; while ordinary 
gymnastics develop into regular physical training, which includes 
twenty-six! different phases. Such was the course developed in 1880 
for training in ten classes of the school system. Subdivided as to grade, 
the first covers classes 1 to 4;? the second grade, classes 5 to 8, and 
the third grade, classes 9 to 10. 
The laws for secondary and superior ® instruction, official publication 
of 1890, state that these grades, similar to the elementary grades, are_ 
free throughout Uruguay. Secondary studies are obligatory and 
optional and there are fees, as heretofore stated, for entrance to either 
course, but these are remitted in case of poverty. The studies enumer- 
ated under the heading “Secondary studies in the university,” are 
arithmetic, algebra, and Castilian grammar (one year’s study each); 
physics, chemistry; natural, universal, national, and American history; 
Latin, philosophy, general literature, French, English, and linear draw- 
ing (each a two years’ course), and gymnastics during a five years’ 
period. 
The course for the baccalaureate in science and letters lasts six years, 
and the degree is obtainable only as the student passes the examina- 
tion in the obligatory course of the secondary grade. This degree is 
required for entrance into either of the three faculties: 
I. Law and, social sciences. 
II. Medicine and its attendant branches. 
III. Mathematics and its divisions. 
There are stated fees for entrance into the faculty for the examina- 
tions, and the obtaining of degrees of bachelor and doctor; the term 
licentiate is considered simply as a certificate of study which may lead 
to doctor. In the faculty of law and social sciences, the five years’ 
course for obtaining the doctor’s degree (titulo de Doctor) includes: 
J. Philosophy of law, Roman, civil, and constitutional law. 
II, Civil and constitutional law (second course), penal and public 
international laws.

hygiene are added to the studies of the preceding year. 
VI. Topographic anatomy and operations, legal medicine, astalmo- 
logical clinics, medical, surgical, obstetrical, and gynecological clinics, 
and diseases of children. 
The faculty of mathematics has a four years’ course in civil engin- 
eering, leading to ‘“ingeniero de puentes y caminos,” and the same in 
architecture; a three years’ course for geographical engineer; a two 
years’ course as surveyor: (agrimensor), and two years’ course for 
contractors and builders (maestro de obras). Regular attendance is 
expected in whatever course the student enters, complaint on the part 
of the university authorities bringing upon the students reprimands 
and at last expulsion.! 
  SCHOOL MANAGEMENT AND METHODS OF DISCIPLINE. 
A pamphlet presented at the Columbian Exposition in regard to the 
character of the instraction given in the public schools indicates that 
it is ‘educational, rational, appropriate, rigorously graded, and there- 
fore progressive,” * and above all practical,” and that it is 
“grounded upon solid bases.” The “methods generally adopted are 
either analytical or synthetical, according to the requirements of the 
subjects included in the school programme;” the child is taught to 
think and execute at the same time. ‘As regards procedure, form, and 
manner of teaching, they are such as are recommended by modern 
pedagogy, in which intuition and oral instruction take the first place.” 
It states furthermore tliat “the simultaneous system employed in the 
public schools enables the masters to teach a great many pupils at the 
same time, but the number of the latter who receive direct instruction

  EDUCATION IN URUGUAY. 351 
never exceeds 30, 40, 50, or 60 per teacher, the general average for the 
entire Republic being 36 scholars to each master.” As the public 
schools (escuelas ptiblicas) are essentially for the people, “both rich and 
poor alike attend them, without the least distinction being made; thus 
by the side of a child of the white race another may be seen of the 
African race, so that in infancy ideas of equality and democracy are 
inculeated.” 
In order to carry on an analytical synthetic' method of instruction, 
detailed suggestions are given to teachers as to the best methods to 
employ with pupils of the lowest grades when instruction is given in 
orthography and reading. Special regulations are also made as to 
physical exercises,’ so that they may neither be too many nor too few 
for the size and strength of the pupils. The boys and girls should be 
allowed perfect freedom during the recess, but the teachers should 
watch over them during rainy days, so that from a hygienic point of 
view they may be cared for. During the course of the recitations not 
more than an hour should be allowed to pass by without some form of 
gymnastic exercise tending to rest both body and mind. 
Discipline®—A teacher or director is expected-to be at the school ~ 
building one-half hour before the opening of school, so that in case the 
children appear there shall be some general supervision of them. 
No class shall be kept after school hours, no eating of fruit, cakes, 
ete., shall be allowed during the study hours, and only at recess when 
there is an expressed wish of parent or teacher, and teachers shall, as 
far as possible, see that the health of the pupils is not undermined by 
poor living at home, their influence being exerted (if need be) with the 
parents or guardians. Another method of keeping up the discipline 
among the teachers is that in case they absent themselves from their 
homes during vacations the school authorities be notified. Corporal 
punishment is not allowable under any circumstances. If the pupil 
requires any admonition,’ it should take the form of depriving him of 
recess, giving additional tasks, detaining the individual pupil after 
schol, and reporting him to the parents. - Prizes and rewards may be 
given for good conduct. Serious lack of discipline may be reported 
to the provincial school authorities and bring about suspension for a 
three months’ period. Continued infraction of rules may eventually 
be reported to the department of public instruction and expulsion may 
follow if that body so decide. 
The promotion of pupils is from class to class and grade to grade, but 
there is discussion as to the proper preparation of the studies in large 
classes for such advancement, and the technical inspector counsels‘ the   
establishment of a classification which shall deal more especially with

the physical condition, character, and aptitude of the individual pupil. 
He also suggests a remodeling of the school programmes, so that some 
studies may not occupy so much of the programme, the object being to 
bring about better methods of study and a more correct formation of 
programmes so as to prepare for more practical life. These suggestions 
are made more especially for schools of second and third grade, and are 
the result of his investigations in the countries of Europe. Thus it is 
seen that the educational authorities in Uruguay are endeavoring to 
simplify the course of study from grade to grade, and reform movements 
are being discussed in this South American Republic, even as in the 
United States, the Scandinavian countries, Italy, and elsewhere. The 
educational reformers of.the present day recognize that the schools 
must prepare for practical life, as well as for the college, and that the 
body must be trained, and the mind not overtaxed by too many studies. 
SCHOOL ORGANIZATION. 
  Buildings and grounds.—The schools! are reported to be generally 
well organized in the chief centers of population and under the charge 
of persons who endeavor to carry out the general regulations. In rural 
districts there is perhaps.less inciting to progress, owing to lack of 
opportunity for an interchange of thought regarding new methods. 
Visits from the national inspector will doubtless obviate this difficulty 
and animate the teachers to renewed efforts. The school buildings in 
populous centers are well built, often of an ornamental character; the 
value of school property and furniture amounts to $778,010. According 
toatabular presentation’ the school buildings throughout the Republic 
numbered 342 of brick or stone, 132 adobe, and 18 of wood. In 255 
school buildings the flooring was of boards, in 5 of stone, in 46 of brick, 
in 151 of earth, and in 3 of cement. The general effort seems to be, 
judging from the discussions in the “Boletin de Ensejianza Primaria,” 
to adopt hygienic methods, to erect schoolhouses with modern improve- 
ments, and to have desks, chairs, etc., suited to the requirements of 
children of different ages. 
Hours of school and length of recesses.*—During the months of Nevem- 
ber—March the hours of school (horos de clase) in the elementary grades 
are from 8 to 12 o’clock, with twenty minutes recess (recreos y salidas) 
for physical exercise, going out into the air, etc.; in the schools of first 
and second grade there may be still two other recreations of ten min- 
utes each. From April 1 to October 31, the hours from 11 to 4 o’clock 
are considered to be the limit of time. A recess of thirty minutes for 
gymnastic exercises and two recesses of fifteen minutes each for rec- 
reation prevent over fatigue of pupils.

  EDUCATION IN URUGUAY. 353 
This system was in vogue in 1886 and doubtless still is, as the school 
legislation of that day seems to be carried out throughout the Republic, 
as far as can be ascertained by a study of the reports and bulletins - 
‘issued by the Uruguayan authorities. In 1885,! however, Don Jacopo 
A. Varela presented a bill which suggested the opening of the schools 
at 7 o’clock and closing them at midday during the months of October 
15 to April 15, the necessary recesses being accorded during those 
hours. 
This change was to be made on account of the heated term, but 
whether this plan! was adopted is unknown. The length of vacations 
is not distinctly stated, but it may be observed that by decree of 1883 
teachers are not to absent themselves from their residential district 
without due authorization, and any unexcused absence at the beginning 
of a new term will cause them to lose fifteen days’ pay. 
Compulsory attendance (edad de la obligacién escolar) is, as hereto- 
fore stated, between the ages of 6 to 14, and failure to carry out this 
obligatory attendance causes a fine of from $12 to $24.2 A decree of 
January 11,1882, reads, however, more explicitly. In the places where 
there are schools? of first grade the pupil is expected to attend until 
the completion of the fifteenth year, unless prior to that he has mas- 
tered the studies of classes 1-6, inclusive. In cities, towns, and villages 
where there are schools of the second grade the pupil is expected to 
eomplete the fifteenth year or to indicate that he has completed classes 
1-8 of the programme. 
The school supply* may be considered as ample in the best populated 
communities, for the law explicitly requires the opening of school libra- 
ries; the text-books are, many of them, translations from the best in 
use in the United States; the school furniture, material, and appur- 
tenances as exhibited at the Columbian Exposition (either by photo- 
graph or by model) include a graduated series of settees, bookcases, 
blackboards, compasses, rules, numeral frames, charts, apparatus for 
teaching the metric decimal system, wall maps, and a general collection 
of apparatus used by the pupils of public schools. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 
Libraries and museums.'—Recognized as instrumentalities of thought 
are the library and pedagogical museum (Biblioteca y Museo Peda- 
gogicos) founded in Montevideo by the minister in charge of public 
instruction, which “establishment forms a permanent exhibition, not

  only of the scholastic material employed in the schools of the country, 
but also of that used in foreign countries, so that the masters may 
- apply the graphic method in their teaching, and national and foreign 
manufacturers may exhibit the products of their industries.” The 
building, ornamental in its construction, includes didactic, theoretic, 
encyclopedic, geographical, and historical departments. There are 
also departments for school hygiene and for a kindergarten exhibit, a 
workshop, a public lecture hall, a. lecture and working room, a depart- 
ment for catalogues, and director and secretary’s ofiices. Three gal- 
leries contain exhibits of school furniture, material and appliances, 
wall maps, ete. Public libraries are usually found in the large towns 
or cities of the provinces, and in Montevideo the National Library 
possesses 21,000 volumes and 2,500 manuscripts, besides engravings, 
photographs, and maps. The “Archives” are specially devoted to the 
presentation of records, ancient writings, and documents pertaining to 
the early history of Uruguay. The National Museum includes 24,226 
specimens, subdivided under archeology, numismaties, history, paleon- 
tology, geology, botany, mineralogy, fine arts, and industries. The 
zoological specimens number 13,741; the next in point of number is 
that of numismatics, 4,201. 
Societies..—The Society of Friends of Popular Education (Sociedad 
de Amigos de la Educacién Popular), founded by José Pedro Varela, 
gave the first impetus to the present school system in 1868, The first 
school established by this society was called “ Elbio Fernandez,” in 
honor of one of the founders. The society caused the translation of 
many text-books in use in the United States, for the benefit of schools 
and teachers in Uruguay. The educational ideas diffused by this 
society and by its head, Sefior Varela, brought about a reform in school 
methods and was the means of organizing the administrative division 
of school affairs. The Patriotic Educational League (Liga Patridtica 
de Ensefianza Popular), in Montevideo, has for its object the promot- 
ing of the interests of all grades of instruction throughout Uruguay. 
Its first object was to establish farm schools and agricultural schools 
for the rural population, but this was eventually given up and the 
directive, executive, national, and departmental committees decided 
upon the foundation of a national college. The first report of the 
“Liga Patridtica.” published in 1890, presented 245 pupils;-of these, 
182 were day pupils. 
The plans so far include manual training according to the Swedish 
methods; school battalions as a means of civic education in keeping 
with. the colleges of European countries; school savings banks as a 
means of inculcating habits of economy and thrift. Other societies 
mentioned are the “Ateneo de la Mujer,” the “Ateneo Militar,” the ‘Con-

federacién Cientifica Literaria,”! the “Tiro y Gimnasio Nacional,” and 
the “Société Frangaise d’Enseignement,”” which last, founded in 1883, 
has as its object the founding of a French lyceum in Uruguay. The 
object of the French society does not seem to have been carried out, 
however, although 35,000 francs ($7,500) were collected and ground 
has been bought for the purpose. 
Special classes.—A decree® of February 16, 1891, established a class 
for the deaf and dumb (designated as an Instituto de Sordo-mudos) in 
connection with a boys’ school of secondary grade in Montevideo. This 
is reported in 1892, by the national inspector of primary schools, Sefior 
Urbavo Chucarro, as a good beginning. He states, however, that 
instruction of the deaf and dumb has not yet reached a definite form in 
Uruguay. The pupils under instruction during 1891-92, numbering 25, 
passed a creditable examination in reading,* writing, arithmetic, and 
other branches of knowledge. Special effort for the care of the blind 
is not reported.

CHAPTER X. 
CHILD STUDY. 
  = INTRODUCTION. 
Prof. Stephan Waetzoldt, of Berlin, in reporting upon the educational exhibit in 
Chicago, makes this remark: ‘‘ What we now call history of education is not a his- 
tory of facts, but of systems and theories.” He then goes on to urge the collection 
of apparently insignificant facts, such as school reports of single schools, which 
would be valuable material for the future historian. Something like this is alleged 
of education itself. A large number of teachers claim that in education we start 
from preconceived ideas, and neglect to consider-the actual condition of the child 
that is to be educated. While some follow theories and presume the facts upon 
which they should rest, others reject all theories and claim that educators must first 
find the facts in order to deduce underlying principles and build theories on them. 
Following the lead of German university professors, a school of zealous workers has 
sprung up in America who have made it their object to urge the study of psycholog- 
ical phenomena in children, and to study them with the view toward furnishing the 
world with required facts for the better teaching and training of the young. These 
educational workers are found among all grades of teachers, from the elementary 
school teacher to the university professor. ‘They variously call their science experi- 
mental psychology, paidology, or, in plain English, child study. They represent a 
movement which is by no means insignificant; hence a few authoritative utterances 
from the leaders of the movement will, it is hoped, be welcome. 
A national society was formed at Chicago at the time of the educational congresses 
under the name of the American Association for the Study of Children, and Dr. G. 
Stanley Hall, the pioneer of child study in this country, was elected president. In 
the following summer (1894) a department of child study was formed by the National 
Educational Association, also under the leadership of Dr. Stanley Hall. These inves- 
tigations are thus organized upon a national basis and recognized also as having an 
important bearing upon the work of the public schools of our country. 
In view of the intrinsic importance of the subject and the widespread interest 
awakened, a survey of its history in this country, its scope and methods, and the 
claims of its leaders as| to its importance is here given in the form of extracts from 
addresses, reports, etc.

CuiLp Srupy As A Basis FOR PSYCHOLOGY AND PsYCHOLOGICAL TEACHING. 
| 
[Abstract of an address by G. Stanley Hall, president of Clark University, Worcester, Mass.] 
The history of the scientific study of children began in this country in 1879, when 
four kindergartners in Boston, acting under Mrs. Quincy Shaw’s lead, took three or 
four children at a time aside and endeavored to find the contents of their minds. 
The results of this work were published in the Princeton Review in 1880. The work 
showed great gaps, so great that it was dubbed “a study of ignorance of children.” 
It came out that the primers were made for country children, while the great bulk 
of children are city born. This line of work has since been carried on into the col- 
lege ranks. As the study has already thrown light on common school problems, so, 
it is hoped, like aid will come to college problems, 
357 
 
-P-A-G-E-368
  358 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Another line of study is the measurement of children. More children have been 
measured in the United States than elsewhere, but the results have not been worked 
over so well here as in Europe. It has been found that children grow tall in spring 
and stocky in fall; further, that different parts of the body have different periods of 
best growth. Times of physical growth are also times of mental growth in acquisi- 
tion, though children then are notable to systematize well. Hence, in time of great 
acquisition ease up the constraint of methods; take the child to the World’s Fair, 
but don’t ask him to explain it all. 
A third line of study is of exceptional and defective children. ‘Study the child” 
is becoming ‘‘Study this child.” The method enthusiast prides himself on results 
gained from stupid children; but we must let the bright children set the pace. I 
would rather have a teacher who knew nothing of methods, for defective children, 
if he but knew the childhood of distinguished men, to put in the model school that 
I should like to see established. An experiment was made a few years ago in Paris 
which showed that methods adapted for bright children enabled a class of ge 
boys to complete the six years’ course of the. lycée in a little over two and one- -half 
years, although no extra time was given. By such means I am confident we can 
work twice as fast with the brighter half of our classes. This is not theory; I have 
tried it. 
A fourth line of child study relates to health. The modern school is a tremendous 
engine to drive the child organism, Five hours a day, five days in the week, and 
nine months of the year—history shows no other such test of child-nature. It is 
irremediably bad if the child’s health or system is in any way seriously impaired; 
better let children grow up in idyllic ignorance than vitiate their health. 
These are four lines of child study ; now for two points further. First, let us look 
ahead and see.what is to come of it. As I see it, there are’two movements in the air 
at present. One of these, shown in art, government, or other lines, is a “back to 
nature,” even to primitive peoples and ways. This tendency is especially in place 
in our country, which is without historic background; we are freer to accept and 
use a good idea when found. Wagner, it is said, got his fundamental movements 
from the Hungarian folk songs; and he is reported to have said the next great com- 
poser would make his fame by working over the negro melodies of America. So, the 
school of the future must be based on original child nature. The other movement 
is engaged in an effort to reconstruct the grammar school course. To do this work 
well there is needed a union of teachers who can tell what the people will stand 
being taxed for and how much can be put in a course, with scientific men who can 
give insight into wider relations. But both of these movements are parts of a far 
larger one, which desires that school hours, curricula, exercise, buildings, etc., shall 
all be reconstructed in accordance with child nature, the true norm, in order to obvi- 
ate the dangers inherent in our present great machine. If the showing of bad bodily 
results made by investigators of European schools shall be fonnd to hold good of our 
schools also, public opinion will no longer give them the support they now have. 
Our public school system is our pride; we must keep it efficient if we wish it to 
retain confidence. (From Proceedings of International Educational Congress. )    
            
  
       
  Cnitp Stupy as THE Basis or PEDAGOGY. 
[Abstract of a paper by William H. Baraham, Clark University, Worcester, Mass.] 
T do not deem it necessary to maintain the thesis involved in my subject, namely, 
that the study of children is the basis of pedagogy; for if there be any pedagogy, 
what else could be the basis of it ? I wish, rather, to recount very briefly some of 
the pedagogical principles that seem already to have been settled by child study. 
And when I speak of the study of children, I use the word in the broadest way. 
Teachers and psychologists are by no means the only ones who have studied children. 
Some of the most important studies have been made by physicians, neurologists, and 
anthropologists. The child study, upon which pedagog ry is based, should include 
every scientific study, wherever made, relating toa child’s mind or body. This paper 
will be confined chiedly to a few principles that result from psychological and anthro- 
pological study of children. 
The first pedagogical principle settled beyond controversy by this broad study of 
children is that no dev elopment is possible without the functioning of the nervous 
system. This is no barren truism, for it follows that the laws which express the 
development and activity of the nervous mechanism must determine pedagogical 
principles. 
Among these laws, one of prime importance is the following: The fundamental is 
developed before the accessory. This is best seen in the development of the motor 
centers. The centers that control the muscles of the trunk, of the shoulders, and of 
the limbs are developed first; those that mediate the delicate muscles of the fingers 
     
-P-A-G-E-369
  
  CHILD STUDY. 859 
and the vocal organs are developed later. The same is true in general. The simple 
and fundamental processes are first; the fine, delicate, and complex processes come 
later. 
This law of the child’s nervous system is the basis of a most important educational 
principle. First the fundamental, then the accessory. This applies not only to the 
various forms of motor training—manual training, gymnastics, and the like—but, in 
general, first a strong, healthy development of the fundamental nervous processes is 
necessary; then may follow more delicate and complex acquisitions. A reversal of 
this order, the imposition of delicate, subtle, and complex occupations in the kinder- 
garten or the primary schools, may please parents and committees, but it is contrary 
to a law written in the child’s nerve centers. 
Again, all parts of the body do not develop at the same time. Each organ has its 
peculiar nascent period. Moreover, there is a close relation between the function of 
any organ and its development, and the highest degree of skill inthe use of anorgan 
can often be acquired only during the period of growth. The acquisition of lan- 
guage, for example, is probably a case in point. If, during the period that the vocal 
organs and the corresponding nerve centers in the brain are developing, attention is 
given to educating some other part which is not ready for training, twofold loss is 
likely to be the result—waste of energy or injury in case of the latter, loss of opp 
tunity in case of the former. So, too, if manual training be neglected in early life, 
during the nascent period of the motor centers, great skill can seldom be attained 
afterwards. 
Corresponding to the nascent periods of the motor organs are the periods of inter- 
est in the child’s mental growth, This year your boy has the collecting mania; next 
year it will be baseball or the secret language; a third year it will be the debating 
society; or he may be hunting or stuffing birds and snakes. These interests are 
sacred. Some of them should be turned into new channels; others should be made 
permanent, as a part of character. But, in all cases, the time of interest is the time 
of opportunity; and here opportunity seldom comes twice. Special studies have 
shown the sequence of children’s interests. This must be considered in determining 
the course of study; for, as Professor James puts it: ‘‘To determine the moment of 
instinctive readiness for a subject is the supreme duty of every educator.” 
Psychological studies have also brought into prominence the active side of child 
nature, and one of the most important movements to-day is the tendency to empha- 
size the active side of education, Pedagogy based upon child study seeks to use all 
the light that comes from the various fields of psychology, and with that light to 
appropriate all that is best in all the various systems of education. It admits with 
Pestalozzi the fundamental importance of sense perception. Things before words, 
the concrete before the abstract, clear perceptions before the working over concepts. 
With Herbart it maintains also that sense perception is not enough. There must be 
mental assimilation and the study of causal relations, but also there must be the 
expression of thought; and, more than Pestalozzi or Herbart, it places emphasis 
upon the active, the productive, the creative processes in education. (From Pro- 
ceedings of International Educational Congress.) 
       
A PLea ror SpecraL CyILp Srupy. 
[By Prof. W. L. Bryan, University of Indiana, Bloomington, Ind.} 
I wish in substance to make a plea for one special kind of child study, namely, 
that in which methods already well developed and tested in the laboratory may be 
carried out under the direction of experts upon large numbers of children. 
This is not the only kind of child study profitable. Individual teachers every- 
where, though little skilled in scientific methods, may gain great advantage for 
themselves by observing the children under their charge; and if the records of such 
observations be brought together into competent hands, important gains may be 
made for psychology. The proper direction of such work is at present of the utmost 
importance. This is the natural history of childhood, and it has certain values of 
its own which can not be replaced by anything else. 
I wish to urge the timeliness of supplementing such and all other methods by 
methods more systematic and strictly scientific, 
In the last quarter century we have had a vast amount of work in experimental 
psychology. ‘The bibliography of the subject is growing at the rate of much more 
than one thousand titles each year. More than a dozen laboratories have been estab- 
lished in the United States within the last half dozen years. We are, in brief, on 
the crest of a great social movement for the regeneration of psychology. ; 
It is a fact, however, that from the highest standards the vast and invaluable 
work so far done has been largely of a preliminary character. Thisis, in part, matter 
of course and a necessi Questions must be discovered; one sagacious question— 
one reasonably definite ignorance—is worth more than a world’s fair full of blind 
“Outlines for child study.”

The laboratories of the world are engaged almost exclusively in this kind of work. 
Tt does not turn out tracts for popular enlightenment. It furnishes few recipes for 
teachers or preachers or mothers. It supplies few satisfying generalities to philos- 
ophy. Its outlay of published results look tothe uninitiated like a mass of tedious 
scraps. From the standpoint of those engaged in it, this planning of questions, 
apparatus, and methods is for the most part not intended to furnish general laws 
of conscious life. Such work is essentially preliminary. The ingathering of results 
must follow after, 
But those who have been working at the foundations in experimental psychology 
haye not been blameless, or at least their accomplishment is not blameless. I think 
experimental psychology has been peculiarly free from this danger. 
But 1 can not disguise my fear that the preliminary part of the work of which I 
have spoken has engrossed too large a share of attention, to the peril of our scien- 
tific and educational standing. 
We promise a science of conscious life. As other sciences have traced the develop- 
ment of the physical world, we promise to supplement this by giving the natural 
history of conscious life from its darkest beginning to the highest achievements of 
man. But we shall be false to all our promises, and weshall turn the confidence’and 
sympathy which has endowed chairs and built laboratories into derision and rejec- 
tion, if we confine our science to a little round of tests in the laboratory. 
Ibelieve that the time is fully ripe for a rapid advance in the ingathering of results. 
The most important things are ready, the things that cannot be hurried. There are 
many plans scientifically developed. There are men who have that knowledge and 
training which can not be extemporized, and who are eager to work. But there 
must be organization and there must be money, The thing most in demand is 
endowed research in the field of child study. What we want is a millionaire, Or, 
perhaps, it can come without the millionaire. The people of this country love their 
children. If the scientists and educational leaders whose representatives are here 
can make the people understand how deep a matter we have in hand, how far into 
the life of their children, and of all the after world this work tends, perhaps, then, 
from many quarters money will flow in to make possible, under the best scientific 
direction, a national bureau for child study. 
Suppose such a bureau established, under the direction of our one greatest master, 
manned by a corps of experts in anthropology, in child diseases, in the various 
departments of experimental psychology, in the mathematical treatment of results, 
and the like. Suppose, then, under the direction of these, a little Gideon’s army of 
trained agents working everywhere in schools, high and low, in the country and in 
the city slums; suppose, finally, that an innumerable army of teachers and mothers 
working as they were able under this direction; whatever sane prediction we should 
make to-day of the outcome of such an enterprise for psychology and all the sciences 
and arts dependent upon it, would in a few years be surpassed. (From Proceedings 
of International Educational Congress.) 
Scope aND BEARING oF CHILD Lire Srupy. 
In the introduction to his concise but very complete monograph on the Psychology 
of Childhood, Dr. Frederick Tracy describes the bearing and methods and scope of 
the study of child life as follows: 
The comparative method of study has commended itself to all the sciences in mod- 
ern times by its fertility in results, and is now being employed extensively in two 
principal directions, viz, the analogical and the genetical. The philologist, for exam- 
ple, compares his own langnage, on the one hand, with other languages (in the search 
for analogies), and on the other avails himself of all manuscripts, inscriptions, etc., 
which show him his language in its earliest stages, and help him to determine by the 
operation of what causes, and according to what laws, it has developed from its 
original crude and inefficient state to its present polished and complicated condition, 
and similarly with other sciences. In the case of psychology the application of the 
comparative method has led the investigator to the observation of mental manifesta- 
tions inthe lower animals; in human beings of morbid or defective mental life, such 
as the insane, the idiotic, the blind, deaf and dumb; in peoples of different types of 
culture, ancient and modern, savage and civilized; and finally to the study of men- 
tal phenomenain their genesis and early development in the life of the child. Ifthe 
child is only the adult in miniature, and if society is only the individual ‘writ 
large,” then in studying the infant mind we are approaching a vantage ground from 
which we may catch a prophetic view not only of psychological but also of socio- 
logical phenomena. 
‘When we compare the young child with the young animal, we can not fail to be 
struck by the apparent superiority of the latter over the former at the beginning of 
life. The human infant, for example, requires weeks to attain the power of holding
-P-A-G-E-371
   
CHILD STUDY. 3861 
his head in equilibrium, while the young chicken runs about and picks up grains of 
wheat before the first day of his life is over. This, however, carefully considered, 
is a token rather of the superiority than the inferiority of the human being. The 
higher you ascend in the scale of being, the more varied and complex is the environ- 
ment in which the individual moves, and to which he must adapt his movements. 
This adaptation requires, on the physiological side, a cerebral and nervous develop- 
ment, and on the psychic side a mental growth, for which time is en absolute neces- 
sity. Animals go on all their lives doing the same simple things, which require a 
minimum of mental activity and which, by dint of constant repetition, produce 
physiological adjtistments that become at length hereditary; so that phenomena 
which seem to the casual observer the index of an astonishing degree of mental 
advancement, such as the ‘‘scampering” of the young chicks on a certain peculiar 
call of the mother, are really at bottom little more than the response of an organism, 
adjusted by heredity, to the action of an external stimulus. 
The longer and more arduous the journey, the more time is required for prepara- 
tion; the more complicated the art to be acquired, the more extended is the period 
of apprenticeship. So the child, having an infinitely grander life before him, and 
infinitely more exalted, complicated, and difficult operations to perform—mental, 
moral, and physical—requires a longer period of tutelage than the chicken, which on 
the first day of his life scratches and pecks, and to the end of his existence makes 
no advance upon these simple operations. The young animal, before the end of the 
first day of his life, does what it takes the child a year to accomplish; but the child 
of two years does what the animal never will accomplish to the end of his days. 
The object of the present essay is to discuss infant psychology. When and how 
do mental phenomena take their rise in the infant consciousness? How far are they 
conditioned by heredity, and how far by education, including suggestion? What is 
the nature of the process by which the automatic and mechanical pass over into the 
conscious and voluntary? These are some of the questions to which the following 
pages may help to furnish an answer. That they may do so, it has been thought 
best to gather together, so far as possible, the best work that has been done in actual 
observation of children up to the present time, arrange this under appropriate head- 
ings, incorporate the results of several observations made by the writer himself, and 
present the whole in epitomized form, with copious references and quotations, The 
inquiry proceeds along the line usually followed by psychologists, and treats the 
mental endowment, from the genetic point of view, in the following order: Sensation, 
emotion, intellection, volition; child language, on account of its paramount import- 
ance, being treated in a chapter by itself. It was intended at first to add a chapter 
on the moral nature of the child, but as the work progressed it became more and 
more evident that to treat this important phase of child life adequately would 
require not only more space than is at our disposal at present, but an advance into 
later stages of life than are embraced in the present work, which is intended only 
as a manual of infant psychology in an approximately strict sense of the words. 
     
Ican not forbear calling attention in this place to one great general principle which - 
is so constantly illustrated in the child’s mental life that it may be considered uni- 
versal. It might be appropriately named the principle of transformation, and 
explained as follows: Every mental phenomenon passes through a graduated ascend- 
ing series of development. At first the physiological predominates, consciousness 
is at a minimum, and the so-called mental phenomenon would be more accurately 
defined as the reaction of the nervous system to external stimuli or the organic con- 
ditions. “For example, the child cries at intervals from the moment of his birth; 
but at first this cry is independent of his will, and possesses scarcely any mental 
significance, for itis made without cerebral cooperation, and, as in the case of micro- 
cephalic infants, even when the cerebrum is entirely absent. Later the mental 
aspect becomes more prominent. When the intellect and will have become suffi- 
ciently developed the child directs his attention to the act, makes it his own, and 
performs it voluntarily. The process perhaps has not changed at all to outward 
appearance, but when viewed on the inner side it is seen to have been completely 
transformed in character; and one of the most difficult tasks for the psychologist is 
to determine the when and the how of this transformation. 
The exact time at which each psychic activity makes its appearance is perhaps of 
less importance than the order of the various activities; yet in order to ascertain the 
latter the former must be carefully attended to, Hence both absolute and relative 
times receive considerable attention.    
  PAIDOLOGY: THE SCIENCE OF THE CHILD. 
There has never been a time in the world’s history in which children have been 
studied and cared for as at the present. The different phases of the child’s life are 
being looked into more minutely day by day, and his protection and welfare are 
becoming the study of people in every branch of life. Parents are observing and

noting the doings of their children, and marking down facts that in time will be of 
more service to those who have to do with the child than one can calculate. Our 
colleges, too, are beginning to enter into this work, for they are putting into their 
courses of study as a part of the work in philosophy, in psychology, in pedagogy, 
that of child study. They are coming to sce that the child is worthy of their atten- 
tion. True, not many colleges have work in this, and those t! do have, put it 
under some existing department, and for the most part it is a minor subject, yet the 
small beginning is sufficient to show that the work has taken a start, and will grow 
as the years go by. The normal schools, also, are entering into this subject and in 
time will do good work in it. Ido not know of any high school that has work in 
child study, but I am assured that in.the future they likewise will wheel into line. 
All this work is good, and it is true, perhaps, that child study is necessarily a part 
of the work of the departments of philosophy and psychology, and, of course, its 
application properly belongs to pedagogy; and physiology, biology, anthropology, 
and, it may be, other sciences will each claim a portion of this field. But this is not 
enough. We must take a step farther. This work may be very well in these sepa- 
rate departments, but there never can be a true study of the child till there is one 
department in which the whole center of thought will be the child, and in which 
no other subject will be considered of more importance and of more value than this. 
There must be a centralizing of all the work done by the other departments upon the 
child into this onedepartment. In this all attention must be focused upon the child, 
and whatever else is studied should be only in so far as it has bearing upon the study 
of him. Such a.department can have its specialists, its own particular and neces- 
sary apparatus, and its lines of research work. Its work for the most part must be 
of a purely scientific character, leaving the application of its results for the work of 
other departments and the arts of life. 
Ihave elsewhere suggested the formation of such a department, and used for it 
the term paidolog: Paidology claims for itself the privilege of collecting the data 
in the field, classifying it, and making new investigations. Its idea is to devote all 
its attention to the child alone, pursuing lines of work either directly bearing upon 
the child or necessary to a better understanding of him. Just as there isa science 
of chemistry, of mathematics, and the like, so there may be a science of paidology. 
There is great need for such a department, and it will not come any too soon. Yet it 
is coming just as surely as anything can be predicted for the future. The very fact 
that various departments of college have found themselves compelled to take up 
work in child study proves that there is growing up a desire to study and to know 
the child. It seems that the time will come when no other science will furnish more 
data for practical application than will paidology. No other science will do more 
for the world, because no other will have a more important subject to work upon, 
for the child is the most worthy and the most precious object of regard. 
One concrete example may be given of what a study of children may accomplish. 
In a treatise on the development of the voice in children (Evoluzione della Voce 
nella Infanzia, Adriano Garbini, Verona, 1892) the author states that after a careful 
search he has found nowhere a treatise upon the compass of the voice of children 
from 3 to 6 years of age. He says that the music which has been written for chil- 
dren of this period—kindergarten songs and the like—is either wrong in using a 
compass not at all suited to the voices of children of these ages, or quite contrary 
to every law of infantile physiological pedagogy and of musical wstheties. If we 
add to this the idea that is being advanced now, that the young child as found in 
the kindergarten is not yet fully able to make the finer and more delicate move- 
ments, as some of those of the fingers, and the constant attention upon work demand- 
ing such movements is a very great strain upon the child, then itis true that the 
work of the kindergarten very much needs overhauling. It is not claimed that 
paidology’s work must be the ascertaining of such facts concerning the child, let 
them be applied wherever they may. Garbini thinks that this music, so faulty and 
injurious to the child, is the result from failure to study individual children, as he 
has done. Whether we accept his results or not we must grant that his work will 
do more toward bringing about a study of the compass of the voice of children 
from 3 to 6 years of age than all the works prior to his investigations, because now he 
has opened the way and others are bound to followhim. Such investigations must 
result in vast good to the child. 
My especial task just now is to work out a laboratory course in paidology, and 
I am far enough along to sce that such is possible. Most certainly such a course 
         
         
   
    
   
     will be quite different trom that in physics or in chemistry, and even in psychology, 
just as the child shows so many sides for examination. It may not bea very fullnor 
  a very great course at first, as much timeis needed to bring it into fairshape. Ido 
not expect to complete this in a year, nor in two years. No such course in any 
subject can be created ina day. Yet, with the opportunity of another year’s work 
in a laboratory with the child, I hope to arrange an outline sufficient to give young 
men and young women in college some insight into the life of the child. This cer-

tainly will be a very smallside of paidology, and not the most important side, per- 
haps, but it will be a very interesting part of it. (Worcester, Mass., Oscar Chrisman, 
in Interstate School Review.) 
In our department here at the Stanford University we are devoting a good deal of 
attention to the study of children. Tho department of education was one of the 
first to be established in the university, and from the first we have had a little 
experimental school connected with it where various lines of investigation can be 
carried out. This little school has the same relation to the department that an 
experimental farm would have to the department of agriculture. The school 
includes a kindergarten, a primary grade, and a lower grammar grade. It is held 
in the university buildings and is supported by the university funds, as any other 
laboratory would be. ‘The teaching is done by instructors in the department of 
education or by advanced students in the department who wish to carry out some 
line of investigation. Records are preserved showing the physical development of 
the children from month to month, together with their development and power of 
expression along various lines, and the development of special lines of intellectual 
and physical activity. It would be truer to call the little experimental school a 
station for preserving and recording phenomena than an experimental station. 
In addition to this work we are carrying on various lines of statistical study cov- 
ering this same field. During the past ‘two years we have carried on extension 
courses with tho teachers of the cities of Oakland, Alameda, Santa Cruz, Santa 
Rosa, San Francisco, and Stockton, and in connection with these we have gathered 
wide ranges of data bearing on various phases of the child’s development. We have 
measured 6,000 children in “Oakland and have collated the results; more than 15,000 
pictures drawn by children have been collated; 1,200 children have been tested as 
to color, choice, and color combinations; 37,000 definitions by children have been 
tabulated, following Binet’s suggestions; more than 1,000 papers on theological 
beliefs have been examined and generalizations worked out; 2,500 papers on early 
historical notions have been worked up, with as many more each on the subjects of 
simple observation, generalization, and inference; 3,000 descriptions by children of 
unjust punishments suffered and as many of just punishments received ; 6,000 papers 
gathered on special phases of children’s rights as seen by themselves; and 2,000 
papers on children’s fee Besides this large quantities of material have been gath- 
ered and partly interpreted bearing on children’s plays, children’s superstitions, 
children’s sense of form, the development of the ideas of sex in children; children’s 
poetry and children’s imaginary companions, (Palo Alto, Cal., Earl Barnes, in 
Interstate School Review.)   
    I. Suppose the outcome of the current movement for systematic child study be 
“merely physiological,” shall educators ignore it or discourage it? 
Look over the situation. Read Dr. Burnham’s admirable résumé on “School 
hygiene” (Pedagogical Seminary, Vol. IT, No. 1), on ‘‘ Mental and nervous fatigue,” 
on “ Period of growth,” on “Sanitary schoolhouses,” on ‘School desks,” on ‘‘ Period. 
of study,” on “ School diseases,” etc. 
Read Hertel’s classic ‘‘ Overpressure in the schools” (McMillans, 1885), and, if you 
read German, Key’s ‘‘Schulhygienische Untersuchungen,” the record of the official 
investigation of 17,434 school children in Sweden. 
Look up the modern literatuxe of fatigue and its relation to insanity, for which 
you will find references in Dr. Burnham’s article. 
Read, for example, Cowles’s monograph on ‘“ Neurasthenia” (Boston, 1891), and, if 
possible, Mosso’s invaluable ‘‘Ermiidung” (Leipzig, 1892). 
To read on a little way into this vast literature of school hygiene must bring home 
to you that children take their bodies to school—lungs, intestines, blood, ba nck bone, 
nervous system—that the school as it exists proceeds for the most part in willfal 
ignorance of the conditions which these and other organs demand for health, and 
that as a matter of demonstrated fact the school is seriously attacking the physical 
vitality of the race. 
‘When you have seen these things, what is it that you will do? You are nota phy- 
sician. You can not be expected to know everything. You haye already a system 
of education or a plan or a skill or an ideal which seems to you good. Your thought 
is already happily engrossed in some noble spiritual idea. 
Do not deceive yourself. On the one hand are the sciences of help, with much of 
priceless value already found and eager to push further for the saving of the chil- 
dren. On the other land are the children in need, languishing in body, and there- 
fore in mind, falling into miserable half existence, failing to attain the fullness 
of life which is possible for them. And between these stand you, the ‘‘educator.” 
Your position is such that you can keep the help from the children or you can hasten 
its coming to them. You can retard or you can cooperate with those who are com- 
petent and eager to help. You can retard or hasten the day when expert hygienic 
examination of school buildings and children will be as universal as examination of 
children’s memories now is,

“Physical examinations could not arrive at the Golden Rule.” No. But He who 
spoke the Golden Rule went about healing the sick. The philosophic asceticism 
which would withdraw from and ignore and despise the body is not of Christ. 
II. Is systematic child study necessarily merely physiological? 
1. Is there in fact or in possibility a child psychology differing in some important 
respects from the psychology of your individual, educated, philosophical self? Are 
children to be observed at all in developing such a psychology? If you observe 
children at all, how will you do so, except by taking notice of some part of their 
bodies or some of their motions? 
2, If it is worth while to observe children at all, their faces, their motions, their 
speech, why not observe two children—three, ten, ten thousand? If it is worth 
while to observe children (1) casually, (2) storing up the things observed in memory 
for (3) future reflection, why is it not worth while to (1) observe carefully, with all 
possible care, with all the precision which the development of science has taught 
us to employ; (2) and why should we not record the observations upon paper, or if 
possible by some of the automatic graphic methods which exclude personal errors; 
(3) and why should we not, in cases where it is possible, subject our results to the 
scientific methods for treating statistics? 
What have we done in this second kind of child study that we did not do in the 
first, except that everything was done better? The difference is the same as the 
difference between physics as studied by Helmholtz and physics as studied by Plato 
in the Timaenus. When you watch your child play, and when you catch from its 
lips or gestures some new and precious glimpse of the developing life, you do not 
suspect yourself of materialism. What if a hundred thousand children are carefully 
observed with reference to some definite question, the results being examined to dis- 
cover the amount of individual variation at each age and the trend of variation with 
advancing age, what is it that turns this process or its results into the ‘“‘merely 
hhysiological?’? We can get nothing from child or man, from Lincoln, or from 
saiah, except by muscular motions, which are in us signs of ideas. The experi- 
mental study of children is not confined to the ‘merely physiological” in any sense 
or in any degree not also true of the hearing of the Sermon on the Mount. 
83. Meanwhile what is the fact as seen in the extant literature of experimental 
psychology? Only those who are ignorant of that literature can be unaware of its 
manifold contributions to many chapters in psychology. This is not the place fora 
catalogue of such contributions. It would be easy to mention single cases, but the 
value of these can only be justly appreciated by those who see them for what they 
are, parts of a great social movement toward the future science of psychology. 
III. (1) Those who wish can be directed in the observation of children with a 
view mainly to the psychological training of the observers themselves. This is a 
matter of no small importance. It may be done in sueh a way as to bring a very 
great and immediate practical improvement to the schools because of the fuller 
knowledge and better spirit of the teachers. 
(2) In some cases results of such observations may afford material for scientific 
generalizations, especially if the work be planned and the results be digested by a 
competent scholar. 
(3) In my opinion, the most important work of the future in this field can be done 
only by trained scientists. A distinguished physicist has said: “It takes twenty 
years to make a physicii The phenomena of mental development are not so much 
simpler that a psychologistcan be extemporized. The simplest test affords innumer- 
able possibilities of vitiation. Every test used should be planned with no less 
scrupulous care and should be carried out with no less delicate precision than is 
demanded in any other science. We are at present, I fear, in peril of a flood of 
“results” which can not bear critical examination. The peril is the greater because 
the public will not distinguish between this and better work. We have, happily, a 
small company of men w ith the best training for this work which the w orld affords. 
Never before in the history of culture, so far as T know, was there a class of scholars 
who were expected to know on the one hand philosophy and the history of philoso- 
phy and therewith the philosophy and history of education, and on the other hand 
to haye expert training, not only in the results, but also inthe technique of the exact 
sciences. Never before in a class of scholars did philosophy and science so meet. 
To the outsider what they have done so far may seem what it will—a heap of scraps. 
But all their strong and eager heads are not at work for nothing. The movement 
grows rich within. Presently the bloom and the fruit. Anybody wlio will is wel- 
come to join this company and share in this work, if he is willing to become fit. 
Meanwhile nothing is more necessary for all concerned than a wise patience, We 
can not expect great general results, much less immediately practical results, to order. 
We must be willing to go very slowly. We must beware of making child study a 
violent temporary fad. If, as many believe, modern psychology is to bring a renais- 
sance, a new illumination for the reading of all history and for the direction of all 
affairs, this is not a result to be achieved by firecrackers. (Indiana University, 
William L. Bryan, in Interstate School Review.)

  CHILD STUDY. 365 
PRACTICAL VALUE OF CHILD STUDY. 
In this day and age the path to any certitude is along and tedious one. Itis indeed 
arather difficult matter to become certain of anything. But in spite of this fact and 
notwithstanding the inclination of the human mind to revel in speculation and 
indulge in rambling ravings, and thereby gain a stock of figments of the imagina- 
tion, I make myself bold to say that, asa teacher and student, Iam certain of at 
least three things. These, when stated in proportional form, are: 
1. That scientific child study is uppermost in the minds of intelligent parents and 
teachers and is receiving careful and painstaking attention at their hands. It is 
certainly in the air which the average teacher respires. 
2. That child study is more than a fad. 
8. That it is among the most practical and practicable of studies. 
In the scope of this brief article I am able to speak of but one proposition only. 
I somehow feel called upon to speak of the third, because I deem it the most impor- 
tant of the three, and also because I am most certain (if there be degrees of absolute 
certainty) with respect to the truth of this third thesis, viz, that child study is one 
of the most practicable of all studies and it is at the same time one of the most prac- 
tical, if results count for anything as a measure of value. 
I always make it a point to tell those of my students just beginning work in my 
department that if psychology is to be of no practical value to them they should by 
all means leave it alone. I say to them, as I say now to the readers of this review, 
that they should steer clear of psychology or anything else that will not appeal to 
one’s practical interests as a teacher and student. For it is one of the chief articles 
of my creed that psychology is a study of immense practical value, that it necessa- 
rily hinges on and joins itself to every question connected with daily life. Likewise, 
I make the claim that child study (one of the chapters of applied psychology) is a 
study of immense practical value, that it necessarily hinges on and joins itself to 
every question related to the question of proper methods to be employed by those 
intrusted with the problem of developing and unfolding the powers of the child’s 
mind, i. e., education, or educing from the child’s own make-up, in a more or less 
refined and developed form, manifestations of its inborn powers. 
On general principles it would be conceded that the teacher should know the 
nature of the child’s mind, just as the pilot should know the nature of his craft and be 
familiar with the waters in which he sails, for it is certain that mind develops accord- 
ing to certain immutable laws. If, then, the evolution of intelligence in the child 
conforms to laws, does it not follow that education can take place in the trne sense 
only when these laws are known? In former years the study of educational methods 
was confined to the perusal of mere theories, but now the wide-awake teacher sees 
that it is of much more importance to study the minds of his pupils as he comes in 
contact with them day by day in the schoolroom. It is indeed gratifying to know 
that this new zest for child study, this eagerness to make the child’s mind an open 
page, is taking the precedence of all other discussions at our educational meetings. 
I would say, then, that the study of children is among the most practical of all pos- 
sible studies, because it relates to the mental health and to the economy of human 
energy. It is almost the only thing—yes, the only thing that can give an exact 
basis to educational methods. 
Again, child study has a most excellent effect upon teachers. By careful, pains- 
taking observation of the child the attention of the teacher is divided from abstract 
themes and mystifying discussions and is focused upon the concrete child as he lives 
and moves and has his being in the schoolrooms. So noticeable has been the effect 
upon the teacher that Principal Russell, of the Massachusetts State normal school, 
has felt impelled to say that the ‘practice of child study is primarily and directly 
for the sake of the teacher, indirectly for the sake of the child, and incidentally 
for the sake of science.” While I can not go so far as this statement seems to sig- 
nify, I do claim that one of the best results of this sort of work is the effect upon 
the teacher’s own life and methods of instruction, freshening him and keeping him 
in loving, conscious contact with the child he is end ring to lead. 
To mention one of the subjects of fruitful investigation in child study, I have 
only to name the word ‘‘fatigue.” Some of us know, and every teacher should 
know, that the degree of fatigue varies with the condition of mind and body. Thus 
the child tires sooner when the work is distasteful, or when the organs are unhealthy, 
or when poorly nourished; and the body seems wearied quicker when the mind is 
tired and the mind more quickly when the body is tired. The child tires more 
easily at one season than at another. The condition of the atmosphere, the weather, 
the time of day, all these affect normal power of endurance. Also rapid growth 
diminishes one’s power of endurance. The child that has grown up quickly tires 
easily. The earliest effect of fatigue is a difficulty in fixing and holding the atten- 
tion. Fatigue causes the child’s mind to be less sensitive to interest or novelty. 
Also one order of studies fatigues the child more than another order of studies 
would.

In a later article I wish to set before the teacher the methods that anyone might 
- employ in his investigations into the nature of the child's mind. Simple tests can 
be used that will be most fruitful of results. It is one of the most gratifying effects 
that the uneducated observer—the average parent and teacher—can, up toa certain 
limit, make these inquiries into the child’s mind in as thorough and satisfactory a 
manner as the best seasoned scientist. The vast array of teachers can furnish the 
scientists with material gained by close conscientious observation. Without this 
material the most adept scientist can not proceed a single step. 
As a mere allusion to the method of procedure it might be well to note, with Dr. 
Burnham, all study of children falls into two great divisions—(a) psychological, (b) 
anthropological. The psychological study of children may be further divided into 
the study of sensation; the study of the higher intellectual processes; the study of 
the motor life of the child. Under the anthropological must be included the inves- 
tigations in regard to growth and health of school children, such as those of Bow- 
ditch, Peckham, and Porter. 
It is our claim that we should reconstruct all educational methods on the basis of 
the child. The living, playing, rollicking, romping child embodies all elementary 
psychology, and every great educational reformer whose words have been heeded 
has been a person who lived in closest touch with children. Some teachers fail to 
study the nature of the child because they regard it their business to “impart 
instruction” or infuse information rather than to ‘“‘educate” or unfold. Others are 
conceited enough to believe that they have sufficient knowledge of childhood in 
their own remembered experience of their early years, absolutely forgetting that 
these few tattered musty remnants ave incidental rather than characteristic. (Cham- 
paign, Ill., William O, Krohn, in Interstate School Review.) 
Tuer Stupy or CHILDREN. 
[Address by Dr. G. Stanley Hall before the Cook County, Ill., Teachers’ Association, May, 1894.] 
  My discourse this morning will be a plain, simple, homely talk on this new move- 
ment which I think promises to give education a more scientific character than it has 
ever had before, and to make the work of every teacher and every scholar more 
effective. This study of children is one of the newest movements in the field of edu- 
cation. It is scarcely a decade and a half since we began this study. - It is a signifi- 
cant fact that this movement began and has had its latest career in this country, 
because here, more than anywhere else, we need to take a fresh hold. of life. 
Iwas not surprised to read in a recent report the statement of an earnest and 
prominent writer that this and the next decade will be known as the age of psychol- 
ogy just as the last two or three decades are known as the age of evolution. The 
significance of this rests in the fact that in every department of life there seems to 
be a tendency toward a kind of harvest home to bring the best results of science in 
every form to bear upon the study of man. It is in this that all the sciences seem 
to have come to a focus. 
But my study this morning is only a small section in this field. Yet, small as it is, 
it is far too large for a single hour. In my own university I undertook a year ago 
or more to give a course upon the study of children, and I am pleased to say that 
there seemed to be substance and interest enough to run it with graduate students, 
and there was meat enough for a good, sound, robust examination at the end, 
This movement began in this country thirteen years ago by an inventory made by 
six primary teachers in the Boston schools. They took three or four children at a 
time in a room by themselves and cross-questioned them in regard to a few of the 
most common objects which school children are supposed to know about, and the 
result was that their report seemed almost like a new revelation—a revelation of 
genuine ignorance. Thirty-three per cent of these children on entering school had 
never seen a live chicken; ‘BL per cent had never seen a robin; 75 per cent had never 
seen a growing strawberry; 71 per cent of the Boston children had never seen grow- 
ing beans, even in Boston. Our school text-books are based on country life, and the 
city child knows nothing, in the large cities, of real country life. Here is one 
instance: A large per cent of these children, upon being asked how large a cow was, 
showed that they had little idea, One thought a cow was as large as her eat’s tail. 
Another thought that a cow was as big as her thumb nail. 
‘That was the first step. .The next step was also taken in Boston. We undertook 
to measure the children of Boston. These measurements have shown first that the 
average girl is taller and heavier than the average boy from 13 to 144 years old, but 
all the rest of her life she is lighter and smaller. Another result reached was that 
the child’s body does not grow y alike in all parts at all periods. Certain parts seem 
to grow and get their force and then to rest for a time. The abdomen, the hips, and 
even the pupil of the eye has its periods of growth and periods of quiescence, So 
that growth in all our organs is a more or less intermittent process,

  CHILD STUDY. 367. 
Now think of the immense significance of that single fact for education. We have 
not yet effected a complete record, but as soon as we know when the adolescent period. 
is and how long it lasts in all children, and as soon as we haye the record of this nas- 
cent period, we have a basis of education which has ‘never been known before. Sup- 
pose we are considering manual training, which causes a great deal of strain upon 
the hand and forearm. It should last through this nascent period in which the 
hand grows in strength more than it does before or after. Suppose mannal training 
is delayed until after that period is past, then the force that nature gives has been 
allowed to run to waste. 
Ournervous system, the most important part of us, does not acquire its full growth 
until we are fourteen or sixteen years old, and after that there.is along period when 
our growth all centers upon function and not upon size. Then for a long time our 
bodies go on growing, the brain getting its functional growth long after it has 
attained its maximum size and weight. Before the brain has got its growth in size 
and begins to develop in function, education must largely consist in hints, in the 
suggestions of knowledge. It should be here a little and there a little when the 
brain is getting large. It is the time when the imagination rather than the exact- 
ness of facts meets the child’s instincts. 
The great danger in our schools, however, arises from imperfect health. I pre- 
sume there have been 100 special books upon the single subject of children's health. 
It has become the custom in some countries that in some of tho best and most pro- 
gressive city wards there are young doctors who are paid a small sum to examine 
every child in the lower grades of the schools. There is a little health book kept of 
every child. These doctors examine the child’s comp] on, his muscles, his circula- 
tion, his respiration, Are the muscles strong? Eyes bright? Appetite good, ete? 
According to circumstances may come this direction: Put this child on a milk diet; 
or, keep this child out of school for four weeks; or take this child to the oculist, or 
to the dentist, as the case may be. All kinds of suggestions are recorded in this 
book, to which the parents have access, but which the teachers keep. What would 
you and I not give if we had had a medical examination every six months of our 
school life? The results of all these examinations which have been made I can not 
give in detail, but I will say that 42 to 60 per cent of the children in the upper grades 
were found to be suffering from defective eyesight, and that this per cent of poor ey 
sight had increased every yearfrom the sixth yearup. In regard to the ear, of course 
the defect was a great deal less, and it was much more difiicult to detect. In the 
case of some children who were thought to be dull or stupid, it was feund that their 
minds were all right, and if they were placed in the front seat perhaps they would 
prove to be among the brightest. Sospinal curvature and other diseases were found 
to be connected with certain work or habits in school. 
But the great result of it all is this: That the modern school seems. to be a force. 
tending to physical degeneracy. It is very hard for a child to sit four or five or six   
    
    
    
            hours a day during cight or ten months in a rather imperfect air, in a rather unphys- 
iological seat, with the only strain thrown upon the little muscles which wag the 
tongue. Nature has made it very hard for a healthy child to sit still; and when we 
consider that children the civilized world over, and in countries barely civilized, all 
go to school, we see what a tremendous danger there is that the race will be imper- 
fectly developed. How sad the thought that the race may, indeed almost must, 
degenerate in its efforts toward the realization of its loftiest ideals. I don’t know 
what you say; I for one believe it would be a thousand times better that the chil- 
dren should grow up in ignorance of all that our schools teach, valuable as it is, than 
for the race to continue in its peril of physical degeneracy, which seems inevitable 
under our present system. For myself, I say, What shall it profit a child if it gain 
the whole world of knowledge and lose its own health? Or what shall a child give 
in exchange for its health? This study of hygiene is setting up a new schedule 
wherein the work of the school is to be judged bya new standard. The work of the 
modern school is going to be judged by new scales, I believe, in the next few decades. 
You know that about half of the weight of the average male is muscle, and that 
a large per cent, carefully estimated at one-third or one-fourth, of all the energy of 
the body goes out in muscular work. The muscles are the organs of the will. No 
one can have, and it is a matter of observation that no one does have, a good, sound, 
healthy will unless the muscles are strong. But it is only lately that we have come 
to think that the muscles are organs of thought, and that when we study muscles in 
these days of manual and physical training we are studying the organs of thought. 
So that these studies of motor education seem to be the most important that haye 
been made. One of the most fruitful in results has been to test the school children 
in this respect. For instance, ‘‘ Hold up your hands something like this, just out of 
the range of vision.” If the hands come up unevenly, that is a sign that thero is a 
particularly nervous disturbance in the children. ‘Close the eyes and stand up,” 
‘The person who has this particular disease soon begins to stagger and lose his equi- 
librium. And so from these and many other tests we reach these complaints of chil-  
-P-A-G-E-378
  368 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
dren; and we know that children have symptoms of most of the organic diseases of 
the.adult form, and that while the healthy child goes through them all without any 
stress, in the child that is a little prone to disease they are quite apt to develop into 
actual infirmities. Some of the forms of school work seem to aggravate these 
troubles so that the child exhibits through life symptoms of motor and other nervous 
disturbances. 
We have forgotten that children can not sit still, but you and I know that it is one 
of the commands which resound in the schoolroom from morning to night. Alas for 
the child who can sit still for any length of time unless he is engaged in some special 
work. 
For instance, in our tests the children were requested to stand still and then to sit 
still. We went through the grammar grades. We only had them sit still a minute; 
then we reduced the time to a half minute, and we did not find a single child who 
could sit still one-half of a minute; limbs, tongue, hands, fingers were certain to 
moye. Of course, witha little attention it made it allthe worse. We saw the secret 
which has brought premature gray hairs to schoolmasters and schoolma’ams. We 
found that the idea that children can sit still must be abandoned, and that teachers 
must learn to possess their nerves and patience if the children do not sit still. 
We are almost compelled to say that a child can not do any such thing purely. If 
he ever comes to anything like pure thought it is late in life. We find that unless 
the muscles have full and free play you can not get any thought. If there is any- 
thing in pure thought it comes from sending out pure, unfettered motions. To illus- 
trate this close connection between thought and muscular activity, I have heard of 
a pianist whose fingers were made lame when he listened to good piano playing, 
because we can not think without moving a little our muscles of thought. For 
children to sit still is to repress their muscular energy, just at that stage when it 
ought to have its perfect work. 
Closely connected with this is the necessity of good muscles. Every time and 
everywhere that the teacher can add to muscle development and activity she is add- 
ing a new source of power. If you can have the child think when he is sitting erect 
it is better than when he is collapsed. Butmuscle culture is important not only for 
the production of thought; it is important for the development of will. Weare 
coming to realize that thought depends upon it, and I doubt not but we are going 
to be compelled to say that will depends upon it. I once studied the will with one 
of the great teachers in Germany. When I told him I wanted to study the mind he 
told me to study one of the seventeen muscles of the leg of a frog. I thought, 
“What sort of work is this? I have spent several years inthe study of psychology, 
and now I am told to take up the study of one of the tiny muscles of a frog’s leg as 
a means of continuing my study,” and I was almost repelled. But I stuck to it, and 
after months of work I began to realize that I was studying a sample of the same 
stuff that has done all the wonders of man’s work in the world; that I was face to 
face with the material that has written all his books and achieved all his great pur- 
poses. By the end of the first year [had got interested and found there was another 
year’s work in that tiny muscle. I studied the muscle in a way that I had never 
dreamed of before. This was a new idea. So I experimented and experimented, 
until at last I knewI had got my result. I had passed in that single work from the 
standpoint of Peter Bell, of whom the poet says: 
  A primrose by a river's brim, A yellow primrose was.to him, And it was nothing more. 
Ihad passed from that standpoint up to the standpoint of the seer who plucked a 
flower from “the crannied wall” and realized that could he but understand what it 
was, “root and all, and all in all,” he would know ‘‘ what God and man is.” Thad 
realized that thought and will and muscle were made by God, and meant to be studied * 
together. It is a lesson which hasstuck tome. It isone of the most pleasing results 
of modern science. 
My next point iy a distinction in this connection of muscular activity between 
what is sometimes spoken of as the fundamental and what is accessory. By funda- 
mental we mean all those movements and muscles which are first developed in the 
growing organism. By accessory we mean those movements and muscles which are 
the last developed. 
Now, how much of our school work violates that law, the fundamental first, the 
accessory second? I have looked over the list of the things done in the kindergar- 
ten. No one believes more heartily in the kindergarten than I do, but I wouldmake , 
one important change in the kindergarten work. I think when you take 4, 5, or 
6 year old children and set them at this fine work of weaving delicate strips of paper 
and at other like delicate processes it is putting the accessory before the fundamen- 
tal. It is reversing nature’s process. Now, suppose instead of weaving fine paper 
you had big strips of lead and suppose you let the children weave them, And when
-P-A-G-E-379
CHILD STUDY. 369 
  they sew suppose you give them a heavy needle and twine. All this kind of kinder- 
garten work is useful. The law I speak of does not involye change in a single 
instance in the kind of work. It does require, however, that the work should exer- 
cies first the fundamental muscles, and not tax the delicate accessory muscles at that 
early age. 
I want to see this thing applied in the kindergarten work. I want to see small 
writing, small figures, fine lines, and everything which puts undue strain on the deli- 
cate muscles that are not developed until a later period put away from the primary 
school. 
Dr. Hall then enlarged upon the lessening of interest and effort in school and col- 
lege in the study of natural science which has been observed during the last decade 
or so. Science is being studied assiduously for its commercial secrets; but the study 
of science as science, out of pure love of nature, is receiving less and less attention. 
This difference, he said— 
I believe to be simply due to the fact that city life has taken children away from 
nature, so that the real love of the children has not been given free course. It is impos- 
sible in the large cities to teach these nature subjects as they ought to be taught. 
Blackboards will not do. It grieves one to see these blackboard leaves when they 
are the whole text of instruction in our common schools. Flowers do not grow in 
chalk frames. They have got to have the environment of grass and trees and sky 
in order to touch the soul. Nature is the first love of every child, and every child 
who does not feel this love is in an abnormal state. 
We have been cross-questioning a good many children in reference to their feeling 
toward nature. We found a good many who said, ‘this tree or this rosebush knows 
me or knows when I come here.” One said, ‘I can see this one languish because 
the other one is cut down.” Another said, ‘‘I always know the difference between 
a fool tree and a wise tree, and I thought everybody did.” ‘I know,” said another 
one, ‘‘that trees feel it if their limbs are cut off.” We had children who talked to 
their doll and their pet hen. We had one child who said she understood her lamb. 
“T know he knows me, for when I put out my hand he sees me and puts out his 
hand; I shake my head, he shakes his head.” The child philosophy about all these 
things is a natural philosophy. The little girls who hug and kiss their pigs and are 
not reproved by their mothers are indeed children of nature. The children who 
really make friends to the flowers and whose hearts go out to the stars, they are 
the children who can be understood and who can understand nature’s language. 
Premature, pallid little Christians they will never be. You can not induct children 
into the love of nature by the use of the microscope and charts. There must be a 
previous sympathetic ground work. And I say to those who love children, you must 
Jove nature and children and God together. They were never meant to be separated 
and can not be separated without injury to all. Religion is locked in the love of 
nature, an@ without the love of nature and the love of God all is sham. 
Iam pleading for child study and am giving you a few of its results and applica- 
tions. Do not understand me to say that these results are the best of it. The best 
is the effect upon the teacher, and next its effect upon the children. It makes the 
teacher young; it converts age into youth; and I believe there is no panacea for 
keeping the heart alive, and there is nothing to keep the heart on fire like great 
love of children. Children live in the heart. Their mind is a very small affair. 
Their life is there. The heart must be cultivated. The things that enter and stay 
are those elements which go through their mind to the will and heart. 
We all live for life. There is nothing so great as being alive. The joy of being 
is the prime element in life. Take it away and what would be left? Think of our 
forms of greeting. What do people ask for? Everywhere, How are you feeling? 
How do you do? in every language. We ask strangers, How are you? Howdo you” 
feel? That is the touchstone by which we test not only a man’s worth to himself, 
but also his worth to the world. I visited incidentally, your Cook County Normal 
School. I go there when I can, ever since you stole Colonel Parker from us, to wind 
up my watch and get inspiration. I find new ideas and fresh suggestions. I find 
anew institution, which, if it were in Germany, would be one to which our grad- 
uates would go to wind up their watches. It abounds in-the fullness of being, and 
this is its strength. 
As covering in substance the last part of his address, we condense a few sentences 
from one of Dr. Hall’s late articles in the Forum: 
‘There is no doubt but that at puberty the former self is in a sense broken up, and 
that there is a long period of stress and storm before this new creature of the phys- 
iological second birth is fully compacted, so that shelter or “safety” in school and 
home surroundings is the first essential. As there is a soil from which all the proc- 
esses of our physical life spring, so these spiritual impulses are the raw material out

of which all the great deeds, long labors of discovery, the triumphs of love and war 
are made, There must be a healthy glow and flux of living, good will, elastic buoy-

ical condition, in the laws of training and reaction, of accessory and fundamental

an amazing advance within our reach in both theory and practice. (From Intelli- 
gence.) 
A TracuEr’s REcorD oF HER Pupits. 
  In the fall of 1884 there was organized in Brooklyn a little school, christened by 
one of its patrons “The Froebel Academy.” Tho little academy grew out of the 
demand of some of the citizens of uptown Brooklyn for a school in their own neigh- 
borhood in which children from the kindergarten age to 12 years could receive the 
advantages of the more improved methods of instruction. It was my privilege 
to organize this work. With a board of trustees representing a very high degree of 
intelligence‘on educational subjects, and with none of the inherited limitations of 
an established school, we found ourselves in an atmosphere of freedom highly stimu- 
lating to best thought and highest purpose. 
In the first year, work in child observation was begun. It had for its object a 
more thorough and systematic knowledge of the child in order that efforts for his 
best development might he more effective and successful. The method was simple 
in the extreme. ‘The teachers met to review in order each child separately—to say 
what were his best possibilities and his greatest needs, and to ask how the first 
should be realized and the last satistied. At the close of: the year the list was again 
reviewed, and the development of each child was carefully noted, A quotation 
from the record of this work will suggest its character: 
“(1) A persistent, careful worker; inclined to be nervous and impatient; a leader 
with a good influence generally. Second entry: Work in class not satisfactory; 
want of steadiness and persistence; influence bad, tendency to pettiness and gossip. 
“(2) A close observer of nature; his general work greatly wanting in method and 
mechanical power; a fine, sensitive, pure character, exerting a quiet hut very good 
influence. Second entry: Improvement for the year marked, especially in method 
of work; less dreamy than last year; influence excellent.” 
A high sense of honor pervaded this work. > home was not called in question. 
The child was taken as he was, and the problem as to how he could best develop 
his own powers occupied our thought. The record was for the teachers only. An 
admirable opportunity was lost here, for there was organized in that first year a 
society of women—the mothers of our children—whose purpose was mainly that of 
intelligently uniting the interests of the school and the home. Had the work been 
frankly shared with them its value to all interested would have been much greater. 
No thoughtful teacher can long continue asystematic observation of the life and 
growth of a child without concluding that he is largely influenced by three power- 
ful agents—the home, the school, and the neighborhood. ‘Too often some of these 
three influences are in conflict, with the result that the child is always the loser, 
Given intelligent cooperation between the first two, the third is largely controlled; 
but not until this is done can there be any least hope of making the harmonious 
education of the child a comparatively certain thing. 
AsI recall the results of this work I see that they were twofold, for it affected 
both the children and the teachers. The even development of the child was less 
accidental as efforts for him became more cooperative. The undeveloped power that 
we had agreed that a boy possessed found by more united effort increased opportu- 
nity for activity and bad mental habits received more consistent check. The work 
of one teacher was not undone by another because of ignorance of his purposes for 
the child. The teacher shared more of the parent’s feeling for the child, and human 
interest and sympathy increased. The subject-matter of the lesson no longer held 
the leading place in thought, for the teacher had a living subject, and lessons became 
a means, not anend. The work grew in interest, freedom was given for individual 
growth, routine was banished, and something of the home atmosphere entered with 
the home feeling.        gy

  CHILD STUDY. 371 
Seven years have passed, but these children live in my mind as if I had parted: 
with them yesterday. Clearly defined and individualized they hold their place in 
memory as no other children have done, and I feel that, through all the intervening 
changes I know them to-day as an artist, who has clearly seen the strongly blocked 
outlines of the unfinished statue, recognizes it at once, though many finishing strokes 
have been added by other hands. 
Last year this work was applied in a somewhat modified from in the practice 
department of the State normal school at Platteville, Wis. Meetings are held 
quarterly, attended by the pupil teachers of the class in review and by the depart- 
ment principal. The growth and work of each child is carefully reviewed and 
recorded. First place is given to the young teachers in the discussion. Their 
insight into child mind is a good test of their native power in this direction and of 
the faithfulness of their work. I copy from this present record : 
“(1) October 1: Age 6 years; bright, but lacks continuity and power of concen- 
tration; does not seem to think at all in number work. November 15: Perceptive 
powers very active, but no power of concentration; nothing is assimilated; his 
teachers are working faithfully to gain habits of attention. January 13: Marked 
improvement; a good growth in attention and concentration; more thoughtful in his 
bearing; memory much improved. March 8: Has been absent and lost ground; his 
work as aruleis good. May 23: Is growing beautifully; inclined to distrust him- 
self; a helpful child, sympathetic, interested in others. 
“(2) October 1: Age 8 years; good mind, sensitive, reticent, sometimes covers this 
with an air of bravado; a careless worker. January 77: Improved habits in work, 
in conduct, and in thought; realizing his possibilitiesrapidly. March 18: Has been 
doing good, even work; much interested in natural science. May 24: Not working 
up to the level of his power; careless about form; all handwork poorly done; fre- 
quent lapses in attention; a child who lives in a world of his own. 
“(3) October 1: Age 10 years; heavy-eyed, not well, hearing and sight slightly 
defective; wanting in self-trust. January 9: Marked improvement; very uneven in 
his work; inclined to be self-distrustful. March 8: Marked improvement; still self- 
distrustful and uneven; influence not always good. May 23: Progress for the year 
excellent; has gained in power to think; much improved in bearing; interested in 
the work of others; gaining the respect of the class; still wanting in self-trust. 
“(5) October 13: Age 11 years; a child of unusual beauty in face and form; excel- 
Jent possibilities in mind and character; habits of attention rather poor; wanting 
in self-trust. January 21: Excellent progress; a gain in self-trust; always tries. 
March 22: Shows an inclination to be fussy over little things, a danger toward 
selfishness; shows the symptoms of the indulged child; general work good. May 
4: Good work; inclined to be a little languid sometimes; a danger toward self- 
indulgence. 
“(7) October 20: Age 15 years; good natural ability, with good general knowl- 
edge; an observing mind; thoughtless in manner; always truthful. January 25: 
Has improved in work, but has not improved in self-control; inclined to try for 
leadership among his boy companions. March 24: No moral growth; inclined to 
think too well of himself; marked symptons of forwardness and conceit.” 
Modern science asks that the subject be studied in the object. Slowly modern 
education is recognizing that its subject is not learning, but the learner; slowly it is 
awaking to the'fact that this learner is not to be studied in the books alone, but in 
his own proper person, in his own rightful place, to be known as he is. ‘The indi- 
viduality of the child is now recognized as something to be carefully preserved and 
developed. That he shall come into possession of his own best powers, that his per- 
sonality shall find freedom for expression and all-round growth, is for him a matter 
of vital importance. To meet this need the school must give the child liberty to do 
his own thinking. Such liberty is doubtless one of the demands of modern educa- 
tion, but it can by no means be given indiscriminately. On the contrary, it must 
be coneyenly readjusted to suit the growing power of the individual or class to use 
it well. 
In this view of the child as an independent entity the teacher necessarily becomes 
and remains a student. Preconceived theory must often be abandoned, and routine 
and dogma banished, while he learns from the patient observation of the lives of chil- 
dren what are the needs of thoselives, and what conditions givehappiest, most truly 
fortunate development. Everything, then, that helps the young teacher to become 
a practical daily student of child nature is for him the best possible training in the 
science and art of education, This work was taken up for the bencfit of the child 
only, but it has proved itself of great value to the pupil teachers. 
Doubtless one of the evils of practice work isits tendency to induce self-conscious- 
ness on the part of the teacher; his careful training in method exposes him to the 
danger of fixing his thought on the subject to the exclusion of the child. All this is 
opposed to that sympathetic relation between teacher and child which characterizes 
all best teaching, But I believe that the observation of children has helped to con-

centrate the thought of the young teacher on its legitimate object—the child. It 
has tended to form the habit of working for the child as an individual, and it ren- 
ders such work more intelligent and effective. 
Simple as the record is, it affords material for answering many questions respect- 
ing the character and growth of children. It is a constant reminder of the effect, 
good or bad, of the school. It promises in time to afford an interesting history of 
the development of individual children, a history that will doubtless be valuable in 
answering questions as to the flexibility of the child mind and character, as to his 
vast possibilities for growth or retrogression. It suggests that the best growth is 
attended with its own dangers; that one-sided development is easy and almost sure 
to attend defective conditions; that the complex child nature requires a very whole 
life to supply its needs. The intellectual stimulus is not enough, but active partic- 
ipation in the common life of all, sympathetic interest in nature and in the activi- 
ties and interests of the industrial and social world, all are needed to secure the 
beautiful all-sided growth of a little child. 
This plan will be adopted and adapted by some of the public schools in the fol- 
lowing manner: Teachers in the various grades will make a record of those children 
who for any reason stand out most conspicuously in their classes. These records will 
be given to the superintendent and kept from year to year. The plan meets the 
obvious difficulty of dealing with large numbers in the public schools, and it renders 
character study necessary in those marked cases with which teachers must deal 
directly and individually. (Mary E. Laihn, in The Forum.)    
   
PAIDOLOGY OR CHILD Srupy. : 
Supt. H. E. Kratz, of the Sioux City public schools, furnishes the results of a 
deeply interesting investigation he has lately been making among the primary pupils 
of the schools of the city. Professor Kratz says: 
A new word has been coined recently, which stands for an exceedingly interesting 
andhelpful line of study, and has in itthe promise of increasing greatly the efficiency 
of educational work. 
Wishing to make a slight beginning in the direction of ascertaining the contents 
of achild’s mind at the age of 5 years, I made out a list of questions to be asked 
separately of the pupils who were for the first time admitted to the public schools. 
The questions were designed to draw out the child’s knowledge of number, color, 
his power of observation, how well he had stored his mind with general ideas of 
things seen every day, and his general intelligence. The following is the list of 
questions asked of 133 children from all parts of the city. The per cent of correct 
answers only is given: 
1. Pick out two objects, 95 per cent. Four objects, 69 per cent. ‘Three objects, 76 
er cent. 
y 2. What is a brook? Eighteen per cent. 
. What isa pond? Fifty-four per cent. 
What isariver? Eighty-one per cent. 
What isa hill? Seventy-eight per cent. 
What is dew? Fifteen per cent. 
. What season is this? Forty-eight per cent. 
. Have you seen the sun rise? Sixty-nine per cent. 
. Have you seen the moon? Ninety-two per'cent. 
10. Where are the stars? Eighty-six per cent. 
11. Pick out a green card, 79 per cent. A blue card, 73 per cent. A red card, 86 
per cent.” 
12. Which is your right hand? Seventy-one per cent. 
13. Where is your cheek? Seventy-one per cent. 
14. What is a frog? Fifty-seven per cent. 
15. What is a chicken? Seventy-nine per cent. 
16. What is a cow? Seventy-six per cent. 
17. What is a tree? Sixty-three per cent. 
18. How does corn grow? Fifty-six per cent, 
19. Where do pears grow? Fifty-two per cent. 
20. Where do beans grow? Forty-seven per cent. 
21. Where do potatoes grow? Sixty-nine per cent. 
22. Where do apples grow? Eighty per cent. 
23. Where does milk come from? Highty-six per cent. 
24, From what is leather made? Ten per cent. 
25. From what is flour made? Sixteen per cent. 
26. Where does wood come from? Fifty per cent. 
27. Where does ham come from? Sixteen per cent. 
28. From what is butter made? Forty-six per cent.

29. From what is your coat or dress made? Sixty per cent. 
30. Where is God? Eighty-nine per cent. 
31. Whatis right? Forty-seven per cent. 
32. What is aschool? Seventy-three per cent. 
The above summary, although covering the answers of a limited number of pupils, 
is, nevertheless, an interesting study and highly suggestive to the teacher. Ninety- 
five per cent of these beginners know the number two, and three-fourths the number 
three. This indicates that time may be wasted in developing both these numbers. 
The following are a few of the many characteristic answers given: 
To question 2. ‘‘A stream of water.” ‘Water that has flies on.” “A little thing 
that water runs in.” 
3. ‘Where there are frogs.” ‘Round and water stays in it.” ‘ ‘To set on and 
fish.” 
4, ‘Place where brother fishes.’ ‘A flood.” ‘‘ Great big one where water stays.” 
5. “Steep place.” ‘Big steep dirt.” ‘A place to slide down.” “A big, big place 
of earth.” “A bump.” 
6. ‘Wet on the grass.” “Frost.” ‘Is misty, sprinkles.” 
10. “Ina paper.” “Up inthe moon.” ‘By our house.” ‘Up to Jesus.” 
14, “A hop toad.” “Likeanigger.” “Ahopping thing.” ‘A jumper.” ‘Some- 
thing that can eat you up.” 
15. “Got feathers on.” ‘‘Good to eat.” ‘Makes eggs.” ‘Can lay eggs and wear 
feathers.” 
16. “Has a tail.” ‘‘Get hair on.” “It’s a bossy.” ‘Hooks people.” ‘Some- 
thing like a mule with horns.” 
17. ‘Got roots and limbs.” ‘To sit under.” ‘To climb upon.” ‘To make the 
wind blow.” 
18. ‘*On big cobs.” 
19. ‘On flowers.” ‘(In Minneapolis.” 
20. ‘Under the ground.” ‘On trees.” ‘At the store.” 
21. ‘On trees.” ‘ Potatoes don’t grow.” 
22. “On flowers.” 
23. ‘‘Milkman.” 
24. “From wood.” “Paper.” ‘From a shoe.” Rubber.” “Out of a kan- 
‘aroo.” : 
: 26. “Snow.” “Grass.” ‘Salt.” “Yeast.” Paper.” “Eggs.” “Milk.” “Corn.” 
26. ‘Coal office.” ‘From the river.” ‘From trees and corn palaces.” ‘Chopped 
down trees.” ‘God made it.” 
27. “Out of lard.” “Store.” ‘Packing house.” “Killing cows.”

he don’t lie or steal.” 
32. “Schoolhouse.” ‘Show you A, B, C.” ‘Where children come.” ‘To learn 
lessons.” ‘‘To spell and read.” ‘Its here.” ‘To put little kids in.” (From New 
York School Journal.)   
   
THE LANGUAGE OF CHILDREN. 
[By F. Tracy, of Clark University, Worcester, Mass.] 
Having spent considerable time on the study of the language of children just 
learning to speak, I feel justified in laying before this congress one or two points 
which seem to me of the greatest interest and importance. 
Several studies have already been made upon child vocabularies, and results pub- 
lished, but, so far as I know, one essential point has always hitherto been overlooked, 
viz, the phonetic arrangement of the words; that is to say, the consideration of the 
sounds rather than the letters. The child’s words have been classified according to 
the initial letter, on the basis of the traditional English alphabet. It is obvious 
that such an arrangement is entirely misleading as regards the real nature of the 
sounds uttered by the child. For example, in such a classification many words 
beginning with the sound of k are classified under ¢ because they are spelt with ac 
(such as ‘‘corner,” ‘come,” crown,” and the like). And so the list of k appears 
small, and the conclusion is hastily drawn that this is a difficult sound for the child 
to make because he has but few words beginning with it as initial letter. Several 
other false conclusions of a similar nature are reached. It is very desirable that 
those who classify child words henceforth should take the greatest pains to arrange 
them not alphabetically, but phonetically. 
In a careful study of some 25 child vocabularies, comprising nearly 6,000 words, 
some facts have come to light different from what might ordinarily be expected, as   
 
-P-A-G-E-384
  374 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
aresult of this phonetic arrangement. The k sound turns out to be not at-all a diffi- 
cult sound for the average child. As an initial sound it occupies third place in 
order of frequency, standing indeed above m, which is usually supposed to be one 
of the easiest of sounds, 
I have several times met with the remark that the young child learns to speak 
largely by watching the lips of those -who speak in his presence, and imitating the 
movements which are there visible. Hence, on this theory, those sounds will be 
best and earliest learned the movements involved in which are most plainly visible, 
and therefore most easily imitated, such as the labials for example. This theory is 
not at all borne out by my observations. The & sound, whose movements are abso- 
lutely out of sight, is learned more readily than some other sounds whose moye- 
ments are plainly visible, such as th in “ think.” 
So far as I am able to judge, the earliest vocal movements are not imitative at all, 
or only so to a very limited extent, and are what Preyer would call impulsive move- 
ments. “The child utters sounds before he is of an age to be able to appreciate and 
imitate the sonnds and movements of others. He combines these sounds afterwards 
in imitation of others, but the faculty of imitation seems to play little or no part in 
the first beginnings of infant articulation. 
The consideration of the relative frequency of the different parts of speech in the 
vocabulary of the child also yields some interesting and valuable results. 
Among those who have studied the language of children it has generally been 
supposed that substantives, names of things, are more readily learned than predica- 
tive words, inasmuch as they are usually more numerous than the latter in the speech 
of children. But it is obvious that we must take into account not only absolute 
but relative frequency; that is, we must not only compare the number of nouns in 
the child’s speech with the number of verbs, but also compare the speech of the 
child with that of the adult, and prove that he has acquired a larger proportion 
of his future substantive vocabulary than of his future verb vocabulary. But 
according to the child words examined by me, the opposite is the case. In the 
vocabulary of the child of 2 years of age (taking the average of my 25 cases), 60 per 
cent of the words are nouns and 20 per cent are verbs. But in the vocabulary of the 
ordinary adult, 60 per cent of the words are nouns, while only 11 per cent are verbs. 
In other words, the child of 2 years has made nearly twice as mucl progress, rela- 
tively, in the acquisition of those words that are associated with movements (verbs), 
as he has with the acquisition of those words that are merely names of objects. 
The same is true, even to a more striking extent, when we compare the acquisition 
of adverbs with that of verbs. The average child makes nearly four times as rapid 
relative progress with the adverbs as with the verbs. It is interesting in this con- 
nection to remember that Max Miiller says that the primitive Sanskrit roots of all 
our Indo-Germanic words originally indicated actions, and not objects. 
The principle itself is one that is revolutionizing modern pedagogic methods. Its 
germ may be found as far back as Aristotle, whose whole ethical system is based 
upon the formation of good habits by constant training of the activities, and who 
has said that even as we learn to play on the harp by playing on the harp, so we 
become virtuous by doing actions of virtue, and just and brave by doing actions of 
bravery and justice. (From Proceedings of International Educational Congress.) 
          
       
  THE THEOLOGICAL LirE OF A CALIFORNIA CHILD. 
[By Prof. Earl Barnes, of Leland Stanford Junior University, California. ] 
This study is not intended in any sense as an inquiry into the child’s religious life 
     
  and feeling. It is intended simply to show the theological atmosphere in which 
California children live, and their mental attitude toward their theology at different 
ages. 
‘The materials on which the study is based are: 
I. One thousand and ninety-one compositions written by children from 6 to 20 
years old in the various schools of California, on the subjects of heaven and hell. 
‘They were simply given the subjects and asked to write compositions in the presence 
of their teachers, without suggestion or comment. 
II. Sixteen reminiscences prepared by adults, in which they tried simply to recall 
and state their early beliefs. 
ILI. Twenty-seven studies on young children made by mothers and teachers through 
conversations, working along the lines of this syllabus: 
God—Where is He? What does He do? Why can not we see Him? 
Death—Why do people die? Where do they go? 
Heaven—Where isit? Who goes there? What do people do there? What will 
children have there? ‘ 
Hell—What must a person do to go there? What is it like? 
Angels—W hat do they do? 
 
-P-A-G-E-385
  
. CHILD STUDY. 375 
Ghosts—Why are people afraid of them? . 
Witches—W hat can they do? 
Prayer—Why do we pray? What do we pray for? Why do we not always get 
what we pray for? 
Religious ceremonies—Why do we celebrate Christmas? Why do we go to church? 
Every variety of faith was represented in the papers—Catholics, Methodists, Pres- 
byterians, Universalists, Christian Scientists, Mormons, Baptists, Adventists, and 
Spiritualists. With only two or three exceptions the children treated the questions 
seriously, and the papers bear internal evidence of honest effort to express the truth. 
The data were collated in the following groups: 
God, His appearance and activities. 
The devil, his appearance and activities. 
Heaven, its location, its inhabitants, and their appearance and activities. 
Hell, its location, its inhabitants, and their appearance and activiti 
Indications of a critical attitude; acts which take people to heaven; acts which 
keep them out of heaven. 
Since the children were not answering any set questions, we can not state what 
proportion accepted any particular idea, but only how many of the children who 
mentioned an idea accepted or rejected it. 
In studying the data an attempt was first made to bring together the theological 
conceptions expressed in the compositions, and then to determine the attitude of the 
children toward these conceptions, 
The central figure in the theology is naturaliy God. The pictures drawn of Him 
are often misty and indistinct, but more than half the papers represent Him asa 
greatand goodman. Heissolarge that ‘‘He could stand with His feet on the ground 
and touch the clouds with His arms upraised.” ‘He is a man that has six hands 
and feet and eyes;” or, ‘He is a huge being with numerous limbs spread out all 
over the sky.” 
He is generally an old man, with a long white beard and flowing white garments, 
often He is represented as having wings and a crown on His he 
He is most often described as good and kind; the stern quality is seldom apparent, 
but the whole figure is shadowy, unreal, and indistinct. 
A considerable number of children speak of Him as being able to do anything, as 
beitig everywhere, and as knowing everything. Ommnipresence seems hard for the 
children to conceive, and it probably accounts for his being represented with several 
heads and member: 
Omniscience is easier: ‘‘God can see everything you do and hear everything you 
say, even if you are inside ofa house.” ‘I have thought and been told that He can 
see through anything; it makes no difference if it is iron, steel, glass, wood, orany- 
thing.” Many of the children feel that God is watching them, and some siy ‘‘He 
writes it all down.” 
Omnipotence is mentioned by many children, but there are few concrete instances 
given. One girl of 12 says that “God could have an earthquake at any time.” ‘His 
activities are seldom described; less than 5 per cent of the children speak of Him as 
ruling the universe, making things grow or caring for our material needs. One boy 
of 10 says in perfect earnestness that ‘‘God is bossing the world.” 
Christ is seldom mentioned, and his relation to the Father is rarely brought out; 
where it is, in one-fourth of the cases the relation is reversed and God is spoken of 
asthe Son of Christ. The Trinity is mentioned by only two children. Christ is 
mentioned as our Redeemer by some twenty-five childrén. 
Heaven is generally, even with children up to the age of 12 and beyond, simply an 
improved earth. More than 500 children locate it ‘‘in the sky,” ‘in the clouds,” 
or “up.” The next most common location is ‘where the good go” or ‘‘ where God 
is,” while a few say it is ‘in the earth,” ‘‘all about us,” ‘on some star,” or “in the 
east,” ‘fand no one in a balloon could reach it, it is so far away.” More arguments 
are produced to prove the location of heaven than to prove any other one point. 
Christ, they say, ascended; Elijah went up, and several close the argument for locat- 
ing it in the sky by saying: ‘‘ Besides, where else could it be?” 
Among those who are in heaven, 482 mention angels; 367, God; 412, the redeemed; 
and 64, Christ. A few mention dead relatives, the saints, Santa Claus, and unborn 
babies. 
Heaven is most commonly described as ‘a beautiful place,” but large numbers 
describe it as ‘‘a city,” ‘‘a mansion,” “a palace,” “a fine house,” ‘‘a garden,” or 
“a park.” It has streets and gates, plants, flowers, birds, and trees. The concrete 
particular most commonly mentioned is gold. The streets are of gold, the walks are 
of gold, the houses are of gold, and one boy has the angels eat gold bread. Several 
say there is no night, and opinion is about equally divided as to whether there are 
animals in heaven. 
The redeemed and the angels are generally the same. Three hundred and forty- 
six children mention their wings; nearly the same number speak of them as looking 
          
   
-P-A-G-E-386
376 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
like people dressed in white. A considerable number say they are women, because 
they never heard of any men being angels, while a few say they are fairies, birds, 
vhosts, or little babies. Several think of them as always small, others as having 
“just babies’ heads and wings.” 
The appearance is sometimes carefully described, as when a girl of 13 says: “T 
think they wear white gowns shirred around the neck;"” and she adds: ‘‘I should 
think the boys and girls would wear their hair alike.” Another says: “I thought 
angels were all the same size; that even if before they died they were fat, they grew 
thin.” 
The activities of the redeemed, or the angels, furnish the most difficult detail in 
the children’s theology. Several say they do not know what the angels do, but 
most of the papers represent them as flying around, playing on harps, and singing 
praises toGod. Sometimes they are said to help God, and a very few have them help 
the people on earth. Children of 12 or 13 often mention the monotony of the life. 
Several mention the angels as carrying the souls of the dead to heaven, and bring- 
ing babies to the earth. Some of the ehildren declare that the angels work, while 
an equal number say no one works in heaven. Tosome of the children this freedom 
from work is the chief attraction. 
The evil spirit and his abode are pictured far less often and with less detail than 
is given to the abode of the blest, but there is much greater uniformity in the 
descriptions. 
The general type of devil is well described by a boy who says: ‘(I thought the 
devil had a man’s head, with a long hooked nose and a pointed chin, with an ox’s 
ears and horns. He had a man’s body, and one leg like a man and the other like 
that of an ox. He had a tail with a ball of three points at the end. He carried a 
spear with three prongs, the same as his tail. He could spit fire, and had a tongue 
like asnake.” Often he is black, sometimes red; three or four speak of him as a 
fallen angel; a few as a serpent or monster. 
His activities are tempting and fooling people, and killing and burning people. 
Some say he bites and scares people, or carries off children. Generally, however, the 
children do not go into any detail about him, but simply say he is a bad man who 
tempts people. 
Hell is generally located under the earth, or below us. It is a place of fire, some 
say like a furnace, and very few add snakes and darkness; but hell and the devil 
play a small part in the compositions, and disappear almost entirely from the com- 
positions written by children over 10 years old. 
In all this scheme of theology natural phenomena plays but a small part. The 
stars and moon are a very few times spoken of as lighting heaven. In two or three 
eases the clouds support or hide heaven. Two or three speak of God as like a cloud, 
and one says the devil is like smoke; but there is little connection in the composi- 
tions between the celestial hierarchy and the mountains and hills, the plains and 
woods, the deserts and oceans of this world. Thunder and lightning, birth and 
death are hardly mentioned in these connections. God is certainly not seen in His 
works by our ordinary school children. 
To summarize briefly the theological ideas of California children, we should say: 
The world of spirits is for the most part attractive; there is very little dark and 
forbidding imagery; terror is unknown; the ideas are generally vague, and the 
standard theological beliefs are often quoted in ways that show that the children 
have had little or no teaching. 
‘The attitude that children of different ages take toward this theology is an impor- 
tant question for the educator. 
The young children under 6 examined by mothers and teachers almost always accept 
what they have been told without question orcomment. They, however, recast their 
theology into forms that appeal to their experience and their modes of thought. 
The spirit world is simply a beautiful playroom or playground where children have 
what they want; God is a more serious form of papa, the angels are playfellows, and 
satan is simply a “boogie,” while hell is a dark closet. 
From 7 to 10 there are occasional vague questionings, but under 10 years old there 
are few indications of a questioning or doubting frame of mind. From that time on, 
however, questions arise; the children try to reason things out and to relate their 
theology to what they have learned through experience and through their studies. 
This critical spirit seems to culminate at 13 or 14, and criticisms are far more persist- 
ent and severe at this time than later. Of course, in this work, as in all studies on 
children, we must recognize the fact that some children develop much more rapidly 
than others, so that there are many exceptions; but there is a clearly marked dif- 
ference between the compositions of children of 11 and of 13 which must strike even 
the most careless observer. One sees this difference even when the children are 
doing the same grade of school work; age marks differences better than school 
gradations do,

  CHILD STUDY. ST 
Forty papers were selected at random from 1,000 to illustrate the critical attitude, 
Ninety per cent of them were written by children between 12 and 14 years old. 
The critical spirit first appears in an effort to place the responsibility for the doc- 
trines stated in the compositions. Thus, at 11 and 12 there begin to appear in the 
compositions such phrases as, “I think,” ‘I’ve been told,” ‘my idea was,” “the 
Bible says,” ‘‘I was taught in Sunday school,” or ‘they say.” By 13 or 14 these 
phrases become, ‘‘ we imagine,” ‘‘ I used to believe,” ‘‘I doubt,” etc. 
A girl of 13 modifies her statements as follows: ‘‘We can not exactly tell who is 
in heaven, but it is supposed that everyone that serves Him probably goes there.” 
And a girl of 12 thus tries to place the responsibility for the statements she offers: 
“Tf heaven is a place where you are said to be always happy, I think it must be 
very beautiful. One of the most lovely things to beautify a place is flowers, and 
it is my opinion that we will find lovely flowers there. It is said that the people that 
go there, who are angels, have wings, and dress in white. Of course, I have never 
seen them. SoI don’t really know how they do look.” The most common form of 
criticism is that which appears in efforts to harmonize theology with experience. 
Thus one boy says: ‘‘I used to believe that the air was full of bad spirits which 
would hurt you, but I don’t believe it now, because they don’t hurt.” A girl of 15 
says: ‘‘I don’t see how people can stay in heaven forever, without nothing to do 
except to play and sing, but people might be different there from what they are 
here.” 
The new desire to exercise the critical judgment seems at times the only reason 
one can find for the questions raised. Thus a boy of 14 says: ‘“‘I thought that the 
devil and all the other things were just as they say they are in the Bible, from which 
Igotmy impressions, but beyond that allisa mystery. Myidea of heaven has changed, 
and now I think that heaven is space. But if that is so, how could the heavens 
open, as it says they did in the Bible?” And a boy of 14 says: “TI thinkitisstrange 
that when one dies his soul goes to heaven if he is good, and if he is bad his soul 
does not go to heaven; and I don’t see what good it does for your soul to get to 
heaven, because when you are dead you know nothing of it.” 
The children at this age also try to make-their theology harmonize with their 
humanitarian feelings and their sense of justice. One boy of 14 says: ‘1 think when 
a mother sees her son, if such things happen, left athong the bad, she will not be very 
happy for awhile.” Frequently the children of this age say they do not believe 
that savages and babies will go to hell, while very many who accept the standard 
theology for God, the angels, and heaven, declare that they do not believe there is 
any devil or hell. This, of course, may be due simply to their teaching, but it sel- 
dom appears in compositions by children under 11 or 12 years old. 
A very few assert their disbelief in any form of theology, but these few atheistic 
statements are more dogmatic in general than the statements of orthodox Sunday- 
school children, and bear all the marks of having been simply accepted from parents 
or others. For example, a girl of 11 writes: ‘‘ Heaven is our dear mother and father, | 
and heaven don’t help to grow, nor he don’t give us bread nor anything.” And, again: | 
“When people die they put them in a hole and put some ground on them.and leave 
them there—and they don’t go up in heaven or any place; they always stay in that 
same place.” 
After children pass 15 they generally avoid telling what they believe, by saying: 
“T used to believe,” or, ‘‘ When I was little I believed,” etc. If they express their 
present beliefs they raise very few concrete doubts. They use more abstract terms, 
describing God as a great, all-powerful spirit, and heaven as a beautiful abode of the 
blest. Angels are celestial spirits and the devil is the great evil influence in the 
world. 
One can not help thinking that they have accepted an abstraction and a name, and 
have, temporarily at least, laid the questions that perplexed them aside. rtainly 
from 15 to 18 there is no such persistent exercise of the critical judgment in matters 
theological as there is between 12 and 15. 
In all these reasoning processes the Bible is only occasionally referred to as an 
authority, and in citing it the children chow a very great ignorance of the most 
common biblical allusions. 
Incidentally this study throws a strong side light on what children are taught to 
consider good and bad acts. Naturally most of the children say that to go to heaven 
we must be good, and that if we are not good we do not go to heaven; but in many 
cases they specify virtues and vices supposed to be especially prominent. 
Next to being good, the virtue most commonly named is obeying God, and then 
comes in order of importance: ‘‘ Keeping the commandments,” ‘“ believing in God,” 
“loving God,” ‘‘praying,” ‘trusting God,” “obeying parents,” and ‘‘telling truth.” 
Less than 1 per cent of the children mention ‘“ going to church and Sunday school,” 
“reading the Bible,” ‘‘keeping Sunday,” ‘‘ working hard,” and “being baptized.” 
A boy of 4 says: “You must be good on the earth and be quet;” while a boy of 
10 sums up the virtues with: “God wants you to obey your parents and to do what 
they say, and he wants you to be polite to everybody you meet on the street.” 
          
 
-P-A-G-E-388
    378 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
The whole career of a good man is summed up as follows by a boy of 12: ‘*The 
good man will first join the church on probation, and then in six months he will join 
the church and be a member. He will push the work of God along as much as he can, 
help the poor and the church, and probably be successful in heaven. He will diea 
happy man and go to heaven.” 
Among the bad qualities, next to being bad, the children mention “disobeying 
- God.” Very few concrete sins are mentioned ; Tess than one in a hundred mention 
“swearing,” “lying,” ‘talking dirty talk,” “ drinking,’ ” and ‘using tobacco.” 
Many allusions also throw light on the sources of the theological ideas which the 
children hold. Many say: ‘‘My mother has told me,” ‘‘I have heard in Sunday 
school,” or, ‘they say in church;” not one mentions ‘What his teachers have told 
him. ‘Evidently the effort to secularizo our schools has been but too successful. 
One boy says he got his ideas of the devil from a Punch and Judy show; two say 
their ideas of the devil came from the pictures on deviledham. Several mention the 
hired girl as an authority, and a large number say their ideas came from prictures. 
From the study of the | data in hand it would seem that we could safely draw the 
following conclusions: If y oung children are to be taught a theology it ‘must be in 
anthropomorphic and realistic ‘form. We may teach that God is a spirit, but the 
child’s mind at once invests him with a form and human attributes. If we do not 
furnish exalted and worthy imagery, the child fills out the form with random pic- 
tures, Punch and Judy impressions, and images of grocery labels. 
Since pictures furnish so much of this imagery, children should be surrounded 
with worthy pictures—e. g., Raphael’s Sistine Madonna. 
Through confidential conversation with the child grotesque images should be 
detected and corrected. 
Many California children seem to be ignorant of the most common and most gen- 
erally accepted theological conceptions of Christian people. They should be given 
this knowledge, if for no other reason, because it is essential to an intelligent under- 
standing of the literary and artistic life of our times. 
The period of most intense critical activity is the period of puberty. Some special 
effort should Le made at that time to assist the child in rearranging and adjusting 
his philosophical and theological conceptions. In the schoois literary, historical, 
and scientific studies should be dealt with in a large and philosophic spi The 
child’s desire to grasp the universe should be encouraged, not discouraged. Later 
he will settle to detailed work. 
The general absence of references to nature would seem to indicate that children 
are accepting scientific lanations as final. It would seem that the schools should 
lead them to feel and realize that Greater Power which lies back of our superficial 
explanations and makes this a sane universe. (From Proceedings of International 
Educational Congress. )

Scientific or laboratory psychology has found a rapid development in America, but 
very little has been said of its practical bearings. Our investigators have diseoy- 
ered, and are steadily discovering, innumerable facts and laws that are of inestim- 
able value to practical educators, teachers, and all who educate or influence others 
or themselves. Of this practical side of the new psychology I wish to give a few 
examples, in the anticipation that before long the science of education, the arts and 
all the technical pursuits in which mental ability is involved, will pay as careful 
attention to the discoveries of experimental psychology as inechanical and electrical 
technology pay to the discoveries of physics. 
One of the most fruitful fields of the psychological work has been found in meas- 
urements of the time required for mental acts. Let a dozen or twenty persons take 
hold of hands in a ring, each is to press the hand of his right hand neighbor as soon 
as he receives a pressure from the left. One person starts the pressure going, and 
at the same instant observes the position of the second handof a watch. The pres- 
sure passes all around the circle, and when it arrives at the originator he notes how 
many seconds were required for the given number of persons in succession to receive 
an impression and make up their minds to actin response. The total time is then 
divided by the number of persons. This is a crude illustration of the reaction time 
which we measure with great accuracy on single persons. 
As the mental portion of the reaction time becomes more complicated, the time 
becomes longer. For example, the processes of mental discrimination and choice 
require time of their own. ‘The way we get at these “higher” mental processes can 
be illustrated in a simple way: A person placed ina quiet room is to tap a telegraph 
key every time he sees a red light, which can be produced at the will of the experi- 
menter in the recording room. The interval of time between the actual appearance 
of the light and the moment the key is tapped is accurately measured. For a while 
nothing but the red light is used, this to obtain the simple reaction time. Then red 
        
     
   
-P-A-G-E-389
  CHILD STUDY. 3879 
and yellow lights are turned on in irregular succession, The person has now to dis- 
criminate between two colors, and to choose between action and nonaction. The 
increase of time required over the simple reaction time gives the discrimination 
timo for two colors. In another set of experiments three colors are used; then four 
colors. As the discrimination and choice become more complicated, more time is 
required, 
The importance of rapid and accurate reaction and discrimination is evident. 
Astronomers have difficulty in recording the moment at which a star passes a line 
in the telescope. The sportsman must pull the trigger at just the proper moment. 
The football player, the fencer, and the boxer are trained in rapidity of discrimina- 
tion and reaction. It is very evident that a player or a pugilist who takes a long 
time for discrimination, choice, and volition will give a decided advantage to a 
quick opponent. 
A most interesting subject of psychological work is the association of ideas. 
While passing along the street you catch a glimpse of good things to cat in a 
restaurant window, and at once you remember the fine dinner you‘had yesterday. I 
say ‘‘at once,” but the association is really not instantaneous, a few thousandths of 
a second elapse before your sight of the food and the memory of the dinner. The 
extra time required for an associated idea to rise is called the association time. 
You may wonder how we can measure this time. The only proper thing to do is to 
go to a laboratory and see it done. Nevertheless I can perhaps indicate with suffi- 
cient clearness the method of operation. Suppose I have obtained, in the manner 
previously eepiaed | your simple reaction time, discrimination time, “and choice time 
for visible objects, e.g. pictures. Now, if on seeing a picture you do not react at 
once, but on the contrary wait for some idea to associate itself before doing so, you 
have added the process of association. If you subtract the time required in ‘the 
former case from the time required when association is added, you will get the 
association time. 
The practical importance of a more careful use of our knowledge of association 
time is evident. A man who can think twice as fast as another will live just twice 
as long, although he will live just the same number of years. To-day mental 
phenomena occur at a much more rapid rate than they occurred a century ago. The 
difference between the sluggish Englishman of medieval times and the quick 
Yankee of to-day is delightinily told in Mark Twain's “King Arthur.” If it were 
possible to bring Sir Launcelot into the laboratory, his association time would be 
found to be much longer than that of a trained Yale graduate. When the country 
boy first comes to the schoolroom every mental act, every thought requires a longer 
time than it will require after proper training. Arithmetic is mainly a matter of 
association of ideas. So much time is given for doing a problem; at 2 signal all 
enele must be dropped. The children are taught that slowness of thought means 
failure 
Another fruitful line of investigation is that of time memory. How can we train 
this ability in the best way? Rhythmic action, for example, involves time memory 
and reaction time. The conditions of greatest accuracy, the individual differences, 
the most common faults, the best methods of correcting them, can all be determined 
without difficulty. What is rhythmic action from a practical point of view? Itis 
keeping step in marching and dancing, keeping time in playing musical instruments 
and singing, pulling an oar in exact time with the stroke. A proper knowledge of 
the laws of rhythmic action might make a change in the winning of a boat race. I 
respectfully suggest to the oft-defeated Harvard crew that they ‘all take a course in 
experimental psychology with special attention to reaction time and time memory. 
Indeed, it might not be a bad thing to give all our college boys a little more mental 
training. If psychology is practically applied in this way the bulletins of the twen- 
tieth century may read in this fashion: ‘‘ Yale was at this time half alength ahead, 
but gradually fell behind for some reason. After the race an examination of the 
automatic record made by each oar revealed that the rhythmic movements of No, 2’s 
oar had dropped below the required regularity. The mean error from the average 
was great enough to cause a decided loss of power.” We may also read: “ Mr. 3, 
of the Chicago eleven, has lately made several bad plays in passing the ball. Tests 
at the psy chological laboratory revealed a large increase in discrimination time.” 
Again, “The noted sprint runner, X, has a reaction time of 0.13 of a second, which 
gives him an advantage of more than 0.1 second over his c ompetitor.” Many  trath 
is spoken in jest. Such a recording apparatus for oarsmen has been planned, but has 
not been carried out because of tho expense of preliminary experiments. Records 
on the reaction time of runners have been made in my laboratory. 
The subject of voluntary motor ability is at present one of the most rapidly 
advancing departments of psychology. Given the will, or the volition, to perform 
an act, what will be the result? Our rapidity and accuracy of action depend on 
attention, fatigue, and habit. Rapidity is required by the typewriter, the typesetter, 
the stenographer, the violin and piano player, the runner, and even the cigarette

  girl, who works by the piece. Accuracy is the essential for the mechanic, the car- 
penter, the draftsman, the chemist, the billiard player, the blacksmith, and endless 
others. Gracefulness in voluntary action is the proper adjustment of rapidity and 
extent of movement; it is almost entirely a psychological affair. Gracefulness is the 
condition sine qua non for the artist, the decorator, the orator, the actor, the dancer, 
and every society man and woman, 
What would be more natural than for such persons to inquire of psychology con- 
cerning the laws covering rapidity, accuracy, and gracefulness? Since the ‘advent: 
of the new psychology such inquiries do not remain entirely unanswered, What a 
mistake it is to train'a child to an occupation for which he has no qualifications! 
No one would expect a golor-blind boy to become a great artist, or a girl with a 
swelling on the vocal cord to become a great singer. Yet we nev er think of i inquir- 
ing if the boy who is studying to be a telegraph ‘operator or the girl who goes to the 
eEpODSS of learning ty pewriting can possibly succeed. There are certain boys men- 
tally and bodily so y constituted that the manipulation of the telegraph key is almost 
certain, sooner or later, to end in the telegrapher’s cramp, which puts an end to all 
future use of the k There are girls so constituted that the mental processes 
involved in typewriting can never be made to go fast enough to insure a respectable 
living. There are mechanics who can never obtain sufficient control over their 
fingeis to do any accurate work. 
Jreceived not long ago a letter calling attention to the fact that large numbers 
of compositors were being thrown out of work by the introduction of typesetting 
machines. The question was asked, Could the psychologists give information 
regarding the qualities necessary for a successful operator of these machines? I 
suppose the idea was to test the men before encouraging them to Jearn a new trade. 
Iam almost ashamed to repeat the reply that I was forced to give to one of the first 
practical bread-and-butter questions that have ever been put to the psycholog: 
The only reply possible was that we had in our laboratories the means of investi- 
gating and measuring nearly every mental and physical element involved in the case, 
e. g., action, reaction, discrimination, association, attention, fatigue; that number- 
less investigations on just those elements had been made; that with a machine and 
aman to experiment on we could give clear and definite replies on every point, but 
that no psychologist had ever thought it worth while to inquire how rapidity and 
accuracy in mental operations could be developed by training. 
The judgment of distances by the eye has received much attention. Suppose we 
take a line with two dots on it and try to put another dot on it just half way between 
the two. An error is made every time. The average of the errors made in a'set of 
experiments is characteristic of the person making | them. It will vary with differ- 
ent persons, different training, fatigue, worry, inattention, and soon. The practical 
man or woman must seek to reduce this error as much as possible. Every free-hand 
artist, decorator, sign painter, tinsmith, and bricklayer depends for his success on 
his accuracy of eye. A surgeon with a large average error will be liable to cut an 
artery that ought not to be touched; a seamstress will make uneven stitches. More 
than half the value of manual training lies in the education of the eye in this respect. 
I have thus far apparently had little to say of the directly educational applica- 
tions of psychology. The reason is this: By education we usually mean the word- 
cram and mind-deformation that characterize many of our schools, whereas we 
ought to include every lesson, exercise, game, play, sport, or occupation that develops 
and improves our mental and bodily powers. There is as much education in play- 
ing (not in watching) a game of football as in construing a book of Virgil. Who 
will say that training in rhythmic action and gracefulness shall not have places in 
school beside percentage and syntax? The close connection that has arisen between 
the psychological laboratory and the gymnasium is an event whose importance can 
not be fully foreseen. The education of men, instead of bookworms and mummies, 
will perhaps find, as it found in Greece, one of its chief exponents in the mental and 
physical training of the gymnasium. 
The new psychology has not hitherto bothered itself with practical affairs, and 
has left the old psychology in full possession of the schools. Being convinced that 
the future of laboratory psychology in America depends on the recognition of its 
value in practical school work, I set one of the members of the laboratory at work 
on an extensive investigation of the laws of mental development in school children. 
This subject was chosen as being the first object of attack; for before we can with 
clear consciences attempt to train the mental abilities of the child we must know 
how the child’s mind acts and how it grows. Considerable work has been done on 
very young children,-but although the school children have been repeatedly meas- 
ured in height, weight, and so on, their mental powers were uninvestigated. We 
have for the first time carried out careful measurements on the mental abilities of 
school children. The experiments include color discrimination, muscle sense, reac- 
tion time, discrimination time, time memory, suggestibility, rapidity of repeated 
moyement, fatigue in voluntary movement, and the usual three physical measure- 
      
         
     
-P-A-G-E-391
  
CHILD STUDY. 381 . 
ments. The results, when arranged according to age, show new and unexpected 
laws of mental development. 
There is another way in which experimental psychology can be directly serviceable 
to education. It is possible in many cases to determine by actual experiment the 
best methods to be used in instruction. Suppose, for example, that a number of 
foreign words are to be associated with a number of English words; it is not enough 
for the educator to know how this is usually done, he must. know how to learn to do 
it in the shortest time and with the least effort. With this in yiew I once made a few 
experiments, not with the idea of obtaining any definite results, but merely to try 
if there might not be a way of ‘experimental education.” On each of eight cards 
I pasted a picture and a Japanese word in ordinary roman letters; on eight more I 
put a German word (the experiments were made in Leipzig) and a Japanese word. 
‘These were shown successively several times to another person. Two days afterwards 
half of each card was shown him, and he was asked to tell what was on the other 
half—e. g., he saw a picture, and had to give the Japanese word belonging to it. 
The results, for which I do not in the least claim scientific accuracy, can be arranged 
as follows: When the picture was shown alone and the word demanded, the correct 
answer was given three times out of eight; when the German word was shown, not 
a single time could the Japanese word be given; when the Japanese word was shown 
and the picture demanded, it was correctly given in every case but one, whereas the 
Japanese word was able to call up a German word only three times out of eight. 
Now suppose that this series of experiments, instead of being limited to a single 
occasion, had been extended till the results could claim the authority of numbers, 
then we could lay down the law that in teaching the vocabularies of foreign lan- 
guages more than three times as rapid progress can be made by learning from pictures 
as from merely placing the words side by side. That is what everybody would expect; 
but, although we have Ollendorft’s, Alin’s, and a dozen more, no one has yet produced 
a reading book of a foreign langauge in which the vocabulary is taught by arranging 
the words beside little pictures. 
Now that the new psychology has opened the way in a new education, we may 
hope that, before long, thoroughly scientific methods of instruction will be intro- 
duced; that the worthless subjects taught will give place to a training where all the 
powers of mind will be properly cultivated; that the pounding of facts into the 
children will be replaced by a gentle but thorough development of their natural 
abilities—in short, that school will no longer be a blight to child life, but a fostering 
institution in which our boys and girls will bloom into full manhood and womanhood, 
fitted to be citizens of our country and to suceced in the pursuits and occupations 
that await them. 
It isa trite saying that education must be based on psychology, but no one familiar 
with our present educational methods would suspect that the fact had ever been dis- 
covered. Scientific psychologists have not troubled themselves about every day 
practical affairs, and educators have been content with the antiquated English and 
German psychology served up to them. The unbroken series of magnificent discov- 
eries of experimental psychology are unknown outside of a limited circle, and Her- 
bartian psychology is considered the very newest thing for educators. Now, Herbart 
was the John the Baptist of the new psychology, and to him more than to any 
psychologist of the past, except Sir William Hamilton, do we owe the freedom of psy- 
chology from mystical metaphysical shackles—the freedom that rendered the very 
existence of a science of psychology possible. But Herbart died in 1841, and the 
last edition of his great work on psychology was published in 1834. Think of using 
a text-book on chemistry printed sixty years ago! Would you for a bodily ailment 
call in a physician to whom the medical discoveries of the last half century were 
unknown? The very spirit of Herbart was against such stagnation; his true dis- 
ciples are not to be found in the ranks of slavish readers of his works, but in our 
laboratories. Although an experimentalist in the strictest sense, I, at least, am will- 
ing to go on record as an ardent admirer of his inestimable services to psychology 
and pedagogy. As for the English psychology, the less said the better. 
The new psychology has arisen within the last forty years. From Aristotle and 
the Stoics to Fechner, Helmholtz, and Wundt, there is practically an unfilled gap in 
the history of psychology. The subject shows, as education must also soon show, 
the influence of the modern scientific awakening that has already transformed 
mathematics, physics, and chemistry from scholastic disputations into live sciences. 
‘Twenty or thirty years ago it was supposed that a short cut to a knowledge of men- 
tal life had been found in physiological experiments and brain dissections. Cerebral 
physiology, however, has contributed nothing whatever to introspective psychology. 
On the contrary, physiological psychology—that more interesting of all sciences 
which treats of the relations of mind and brain—presupposes not only a minute 
anatomical knowledge of the brain, but also a well-developed introspective psychol- 
ogy with carefully ascertained and accurately measured facts. The confusion of 
the psychological laboratory with neurological laboratory, and of experimental       
       
   
-P-A-G-E-392
    382 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
psychology with physiological psychology, has led to the popular belief that we 
experimentalists are merely disguised materialists. This belief has been fostered by 
many nonpsychological writers. 
The fundamental method of the new or laboratory psychologists does not differ 
from the method of Aristotle, namely, direct observation of facts. Galileo modified 
this method for physics by introducing careful experiment and measurement; Fech- 
ner did the same for psychology. The characteristic of the new psychology does 
not lie in supplanting introspection by some materialistic theory, but in the substi- 
tution of accurate and trustworthy introspective methods for the guesswork and 
speculation of the past. 
To the seeker for knowledge the medieval psychology had nothing to offer but 
vague and wordy discussions of the ego, the self, the nature of mind, the continuity 
of consciousness during sleep, ete., which were as far removed from affairs as medi- 
wval metaphysies. We Americans are a practical people and apply the standard of 
usefulness eyen in scientific pursuits. The new psychology, however, is not afraid 
of being tested in this way. With the proper laboratory equipment (we need as 
good accommodations and apparatus as a physical laboratory) and with enough 
earnest scientific workers (of whom we have not half enough), we can do as much 
for education and mental life in general as physics does for railroads, bridges, and 
electrical engineering. (E. W. Scripture, in The Forum.) . 
  EDUCATION BY PLAYS AND GAMES. 
One of the most important recent contributions to the literature of child-life study 
is the monograph on education by plays and games, by G. E. Johnson, of Clark Uni- 
versity. The paper presents a list of 440 plays and games, accompanied by the 
writer’s estimate of their nature as instruments of mertal and physical training. 
In his introduction, the author says as to the nature of play per se: 
“««Play is the first poetry of the human being. | It is the working off at once of the 
overflow of both mental and physical powers.’ Thus Richter defines play. Froebel 
says it is the self-active representatien of the inner from inner necessity and im- 
pulse. The distinctive characteristic of play is spontaneity. In the above, Richter 
emphasizes the spontancity which is dependent upon physical conditions, Froe- 
bel, that which is dependent upon the mental attitude. In the healthy child there is 
a constant storing up and expenditure of energy. The overfilled or rested cells 
mnust discharge. They may be likened to an intermittent spring which, becoming so 
full, must empty. This rhythmic sequence of anabolism and katabolism seems to be 
nature’s method of activity for the securing of growth and development. When 
katabolism follows spontaneously upon completed anabolism, the discharge is accom- 
panied with pleasure. This is the exuberance of life which impels the young child 
to leap and dance with no apparent object but that of motion. The very discharge 
is a joy, a relief. When anabolism is incomplete and katabolism takes place, or 
when katabolism is induced by force of will or fear, the accompanying conscious- 
ness is one of unpleasantness or pain. Compela child to jump rope after fatigue 
has set in, and it is no longer pleasurable but painful. Spontaneity is gone, 
“The mental attitude is no less important than the physical conditions in the 
spontaneity of an activity. The physical conditions being favorable, the distinction 
between play and what is not play is wholly subjective, a question of ‘mental 
attitude.’ Just what this mental attitude is, is not easy to define. It is often 
capricious. It is coincident with an expectation of pleasure. Mark Twain gives 
an illustration in ‘How Tom Sawyer got his fence whitewashed.’ Whitewash was 
grinding drudgery to Tom, but when anticipations of pleasure had been aroused in 
his playmates and they had taken the brush at the sacrifice of sundry trinkets, 
whitewashing had become play. It generally involves imagination. To Mr. Bolton 
is due this story of a stone pile which a father formd much difficulty in getting his 
boys to remove: Two weeks had passed and the pile had not perceptibly diminished. 
Kindling a brush fire in the ditch where the stones were to be thrown, and impro- 
vising a fire engine out of a cart, he exclaimed: ‘Come, boys, here’s a fire! Let’s be 
firemen and put it out. This is the engine and these are buckets of water (pointing 
to the stones). Come on!’ And, with shouting and whistling and puffing, the stones

were dragged and dumped until the pile had disappeared.'! There is always an 
accompanying mental excitement which, especially in games, is largely due to an 
uncertainty in the outcome. Take this entirely out of a game and the play becomes 
insipid monotony. On the other hand, I have known a boy to relieve truly drudg- 
ing labor by fixing beforehand the amount to be done at a certain hour and racing 
against time. It must await present interest. Compel a boy to continue quietly his 
game of marbles after an alarm of fire has sounded in his neighborhood and play 
has changed to labor. 
“In play, pleasure always accompanies the activity. There may or may not be 
some additional reward resulting from the activity. In labor, the reward does not 
accompany but follows the activity. A boy plays ball and pleasure attends every 
movement. There may also result greatly improved health and skill of hand and 
eye, sometimes even a pecuniary reward. A boy saws wood and the reward is the 
increase of strength and the money received. Work (effort directed to an end— 
Webster) is involved in both, generally to a greater degree in play.” 
Passing then to the educational importance of play, the author continues: 
“A clear understanding of the nature of play is of the highest importance to 
teachers. Play is deserving of better repute than that in which it is sometimes 
held, and labor receives often a praise that is hardly due. There is no virtue in 
labor for the sake of labor any more than there is virtue in self-denial for self-denial’s 
sake, or virtue in being miserable. Work is the honor term. Every good thing 
accomplished in life is accomplished by work, but this work may often be the work 
of play quite as well as the work of labor. Work does not thereby accomplish more 
because it is laborious and irksome, As Dr. Brinton says: ‘The measure of value 
of work is the amount of play there is in it, and the measure of value of play is the 
amount of work there is in it.’ 
“From the very fact that joyousness aids the anabolic processes, while pain 
retards, the more play the more work and the more power to work, the more labor 
the less work and the less power to work. Every effort to make attractive and inter- 
esting the school work of children, every effort to bring the order of studies into 
line with the child’s present interest and stage of development, is a recognition of 
this. For the success of teaching, both as to amount of knowledge acquired and 
the discipline received, it is essential that there be all possible play in the work. 
Nobody will deny that the intensity of the activity in any exercise and the benefi- 
cence of its results increase with the pleasure involved. It is a platitude to say that 
no one ever made marked progress in a study he detested, or rose high in a profes- 
sion he never enjoyed. The men who have stood high have been those who played, 
as well as plied their trades and professions. Stupidity is but another name for 
ennui, and brightness for interest. ‘All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,’ 
is as true a pedagogical aphorism as ever was written. To acquire alert minds chil- 
dren must be alert, and the young child can be alert only as his play instinet is 
aroused. Shut out the play instinct of a young child and you stunt his growth; 
neglect to draw it out and you lessen his possibilities for strength. 
“Tt is to be regretted that in our public school system the play instinct of the 
child does not find moreroom forexpression. In many schools the office of the play- 
ground is to counteract the stultifying effects of the schoolroom. ‘If,’ as Schiller 
says, ‘man is wholly man only when he plays,’ we err in hoping to make a child 
more of a man while we force him from the truest expression of himself. 
“Tt will no doubt be objected that the child should early be taught to distinguish 
between play and labor and bravely undergo the latter, for he must labor and not 
play through life; that great men have always, ‘ while others slept, toiled upward 
in the night.’ Certainly work must be done at all hazards; if not in play, then in 
1This story was taken from the records of children in possession of the Graduates’ 
Association of the State Normal School at Worcester, Mass.

  labor. But the child should not be led to expect a life of toil. Rather he should be 
taught that a life of play-work is the ideal, and that it is his privilege to seek it. 
“There is no proof that great men ‘toiled upward in the night,’ except as they 
were borne over the drudgery in the eagerness of their interest, as a tennis player 
again and again ‘shacks’ the widely-batted tennis ball. It was the labor involved 
in play. It is doubtful if a great man ever accomplished his lifo work without 
having reached a play interest in it. The power of work and endurance said to be 
acquired by the conscientious student in undergoing drudgery never equals that 
which is his when his work is no longer labor, but play. Mr. Yoder, in his Study of 
the Boyhood of Great Men, shows that as boys they not only revolted sometimes 
against the routine of uninteresting work and followed their own inclinations, but, 
much more, they found play in a work or work in a play that disciplined those pow- 
ers which made them famous as men. Dickens playing for days that he was some 
character of whom he had read, Darwin with his passion for collections, Stephenson 
with his boilers, Tennyson and Emerson writing rhymes for fun, Washington play- 
ing soldier, Kingsley preaching little sermons, Miss Alcott with pencil and paper, 
are illustrations. 
“Much has been said by educators in regard to the importance of the play instinet 
in education. Plato: ‘Education should begin with the right direction of children’s 
sports.’! ‘The plays of children should be subject to laws.’? ‘The plays of chil- 
dren should be along the line of their future occupations.’! ‘Do not use compul- 
sion, but let education be a sort of amusement.’*® Aristotle: ‘Children should have 
entertaining employment.’* Quintilian: ‘Instruction should be amusing to the 
child.’ Fenelon: ‘Plays are efficacious in education.” Rabelais: ‘Studies should be 
made amusing and interesting.’ Locke: ‘The chief art is to make all that children 
have to do sport and play.’® Richter: ‘The plays of children are as serious and 
full of meaning in themselves and in reference to their future as ours are to us.’? 
Froebel:* ‘Play is the purest, most spiritual activity of men at this stage, and at 
the same time typical of human life as a whole, of inner hidden natural life in men 
and all things. It holds the sources cf all that is good. The plays of children are 
the germinal leaves of all later life.’”

EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
It has been decided, after much consideration and wide conference, to devote the 
entire three days to the subject of child study. Within a very few years several 
societies have been formed for this purpose; several journals have been started; the 
school children in many cities of this country and Europe have been measured or 
tested as to the rate of growth of body and muscular and mental power; various 
classes of defect of sense, limb, mind, character, form of error in school work and of 
ignorance on entering school, have been tabulated. _From these results a new body 
of literature is being developed, which throws much light upon the controllable 
causes, whether! of excellence or defect, and contains many suggestions on the 
method and matter of teaching, and promises to show how instruction ean be made 
more effective as well as to point out the true beginning of instructions in the entire 
group of psychological subjects. 
Itis hoped that not only all teachers, anthropologists, and physicians interested 
in this work, but parents and others representing different lines of study and from 
locations widely separated, may here meet, stimulate, and encourage each other by 
personal acquaintance, mutual suggestion, and plans for future cooperation. 
The organization of a national society with officers from different States will be 
considered. 
All papers are strictly limited to twenty minutes. It is expected that discussions 
and reports wiil be confined to ten minutes each, in the hope that many workers 
may be heard from and results and methods from many sources may be recorded.

ADDRESS BY CHARLES G. BONNEY, PRESIDE 
AUXILIARY. 
  OF THE WORLD'S CONGRESS 
FRIenpDs or UNtversat Epucation, Epucators or Many Lanps: I bid you wel- 
come to the International Congress of Education. 
The special educational congresses which have occupied the past eight days are 
closed, and the International Congress of Education, in which the leading depart- 
ments of education will have appropriate presentation, is about to open, That the 
eighty-six sessions of the fourteen congresses held in this building during the time 
specified have more than realized the expectations entertained in regard to them, is 
agreed by all whose opinions I have heard expressed. We have enjoyed a series of 
gratifying surprises in the attendance given, the interest manifested, and the high 
character of the proceedings. Most noteworthy has been the spirit of peace and 
progress, which has reigned supreme. Distinguished educators from many countries 
have met together as old friends to consider common interests and aims. 
If the special congresses have been so satisfactory, what may we not expect from 
the International Congress of Education, in which all will take a part, with its fifteen 
separate department congresses, presenting a programme with forty-seven sessions? 
The original announcement of the World’s Congresses of 1893, issued in September, 
8 included, among other subjects, “Educational systems, ‘their advantages and 
their defects, ‘and the means by which they may best be adapted to the enormous 
increase in all departments of knowledge.” 
The educational systems of the pas have Leen outgrown. This fact is so obvious 
that it needs neither argument nor illustration. Those systems were but local and 
temporary, and could not permanently endure. The old education had no place for    
       
 
-P-A-G-E-448
    438 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
those important departments which are the peculiar glory of the new. The kinder- 
garten, manual and art training, technological instruction, business education, 
practical psychology, are new gifts to the educational world. 
Modern science is itself a new world, created within the memory of living men. 
In all of the old branches of learning there has been a wonderful increase of knowl- 
edge. There is now more of language and literature; more of natural science; more 
of political and social science; more of moral and intellectual science; more of 
technological and constructive science, and more of other important branches of 
knowledge, than can be mastered during the school years. 
What can be done to meet this emergency ? 
The cruelty of cramming has been tried and abandoned as worse than utterly use- 
less. The liberty of election has been enlarged and reenlarged without fully satis- 
factory results. But the difficulty not only remains, it increases. We can not meet 
it by suppressing knowledge; we must endeavor to do so by enlarging the means 
and improving the syste: of education. The old curriculum was a pamphlet; the 
new curriculum is a volume, growing larger from year to year. 
While the learned world ponders the new educational problems and seeks a means 
of their solution, a new and tremendous influence enters the field and asks attention. 
It is the spirit of the new age, demanding international fraternity and cooperation 
in every department of civilized life. The institutions of learning have more than 
willingly responded to this call, and have manifested a desire to accede to it so far 
as sound reason may lead the way. A true and enduring educational system must 
have its national and international as well as its local relations. 
The time has come to discriminate the universal from the particular, the require- 
ments of all from the needs of the few, and form an educational system in which 
those discriminations will be preserved. The programmes of the educational con- 
gresses held during the past eight days, and those which are now to follow, show 
that the elements of a true educational system are at last at command. To some 
extent the characteristics of the new education may already be discerned. 
(1) While in the primary schools the kindergarten and the first rudiments of 
manual and art training will lay the foundation for future culture, the instruction 
will, for the most part, be limited to such knowledge as is universally necessary for 
intelligent human relations. In a word, the instruction imperatively demanded for 
the everyday needs of all classes will be the chief object of the primary schools. 
(2) In the secondary schools will be given a knowledge of the existence and 
nature of all the sciences, arts, and callings, so far as may be necessary to enable 
the learner to select those in which he will be most likely to find his appropriate 
life work. The learner must know that there is such a science as chemistry, such 
an art as engineering, and their general nature and scope, to enable him to decide 
whether in either of them, or in some other pursuit, he will be likely to be most 
serviceable to himself and his fellow-men. 
(3) In the higher institutions of learning will naturally be given that thorough 
and prolonged culture in a carefully selected course of study, chosen with reference 
to a proposed life occupation, that careful and efficient training and discipline which 
will qualify the student for the best discharge of the duties of that occupation. 
(4) In the professional and technological schools there will be given both a theo- 
retical and a practical training for the particular requirements and duties of a 
selected calling, such as law, medicine, engineering, agriculture, or any other. 
Thus may be secured, in a rational order, that general knowledge which intelli- 
gent persons in all countries should possess; that mental culture and discipline of 
the brain which correspond to the skill and accuracy of the artisan’s accomplished 
hand, and that special and adequate preparation required for the successful pursuit 
of a special calling. 
Among the signs of the times which distinguish the new education from the old, 
a few may be briefly noticed. 
First in order and importance Iname the kindergarten, which for tho first time in 
tho whole history of the race actually established in the world the great idea that 
the schoolroom can and should bo made a place of delight, and that a love of learn- 
ing is vital to its attainment. 
Next may be mentioned the training of the hand to perform what the mind has 
been taught to conceive and plan, thus providing against that‘ pathetic helpless- 
ness” sometimes found in very learned men. 
Another important sign of substantial progress is in the introduction of practical 
psychology, to give both teacher and student that knowledge of the mind, its con- 
stitution, faculties, and operations, without which serious errors can not be avoided. 
Equally important is the idea, now well established, that the farmer, the mann- 
facturer, the merchant, or other business man, needs a thorough education for his 
calling quite as much as do the professional classes for theirs. Modern experience 
has.abundantly shown that a farm abandoned by ignorant incompetence as worn-out 
and worthless can be made to blossom like the rose under an application of intelli-

        EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 439 
  gent skill and scientific knowledge such as tho higher institutions of learning 
impart. 
Of vast importance and significance is the new movement of colleges and univer- 
sities, under the name of university extension, to ally themselves with the people. 
That alliance will prove of inestimable value to both. 
In the highest sense, there is but one education, of which all schools and all 
instruction should form appropriate parts. If ene cannot be a master of philology, 
or astronomy, or geology, or architecture, or engineering, it should, nevertheless, 
be his privilege to know enough of cach to follow with pleasure and with benefit 
the achievements of its leaders. 
In the new education we shall miss many things with which we have been familiar 
in the old. Among them will be the incredible folly of attempting to eradicate the 
natural differences of mental endowment, and to reduce all to the dead level of the 
average attainments. 
We shall miss the barbaric system of rewards and punishments, under which the 
most heroic efforts to overcome natural deficiences were visited with humiliation, 
while merely natural gifts, without merit in their application, were conspicuously 
rewarded. 
The new education will endure, because it will rest upon correct and eternal prin- 
ciples; because it will be supported by an enlightened public opinion, and by the 
settled public policy of the enlightened nations of the world. The basis of this 
public policy is the truth that the true wealth of nations is in their men, and that 
as a mere matter of self-interest they must provide for all, even the humblest, 
enough education to stimulate the development of latent genius. 
The new education, extended as it will be throughout the world, will do.as much 
as, if not more than, any other agency to promote the unity and peace of man- 
kind. For by education we mean not merely the training of the intellect; we 
mean also the culture of the heart and the hand. The golden circle of education 
embraces not only literature, science, and art, but it includes as well the whole broad 
domain of virtue, morals, and religion. 
In conelnsion, I extend to this World’s Educational Congress my highest wishes 
for its success in every department, with many regrets that the arrangements for 
the congresses to be held during the month of August will prevent me from attend- 
ing the sessions, in the proceedings of which I shall nevertheless feel a profound 
interest. 
  REPORT OF COMMITTEE OF ARRANGEMENTS, NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIA- 
TION, ON INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF EDUCATION, BY HON, WILLIAM 'f. 
HARRIS, CHAIRMAN.      
To the World's Congress Auxiliary of the World's Columbian Exposition: 
The committee on international congress of education, appointed at your sugges- 
tion by the National Educational Association of the United States, beg leave here- 
with to report that they have extended due invitations to the friends of education 
and the workers in its several fields, in all foreign countries, and in the several States 
and Territories of the United States. Sympathetic response has been made every- 
where to these invitations, and the number of those expressing intention to be 
present is larger than we had reason to hope, when we consider the number of foreign 
delegates enrolled at world’s congresses hithertoheld; and this, too, without making 
any deduction for the much greater distances to be passed over to reach Chieago 
than to reach London, or Brussels, or Paris, or New York, from the centers of popu- 
lation. 
In preparation for the discussions to take place this week, the committee has 
endeavored to select questions of international interest—questions that affect the 
management of schools in all countries, wherever they are. And tho renewed and 
increasing interest in school education in all civilized countries at this time is an 
occasion for congratulation among all friends of human progress. 
The central place of school education among the great regenerating movements of 
modern civilization is obvious when one looks over the list represented in the series 
of congresses which have held their sessions in this edifice since its opening in May, 
or are to follow between this and the middle of October. The common character- 
istic of movements that help forward civilization is that they increase self-help in 
the individual. There is no institution that does so much for increasing the power 
of self-help as the good school. It uses the time of youth—the time not yet of full 
value for productive industry, and yet most fruitful for growth in intellect and 
power of will. Education gives directive power—the power to combine things, and 
the power to combine men. 
It is therefore with a strong show of reason that the teachers of our schools point 
to the exhibits in the vast aggregate of the World’s Fair, and claim a la share in 
the development of the producing causes that have furnished the display of industry 
and skill and taste.

440 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  It is confidently hoped that the discussions of these congresses will help make 
clear to us not only the strong points of our school systems, but also the needs and 
defects which exist and prevent the highest-achievement. 
The fifteen departments of this congress, which hold their sessions in the morn- 
ings of Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday of this week, represent, in equal propor- 
tions, the new and the old; one-half devoted to understanding and explaining what 
is already established and in vogue, the other half devoted to showing the claims 
of what is new, and urging its adoption into the school system. ‘The educational 
problems are all to be discussed, if wisely discussed, in the light of these two sides 
or tendencies. The committees on programmes have kept this in view. 
In the department of higher education the distinction between the college and the 
university is brought prominently forward, and the relation of a course of study 
such as the old college furnished, namely, for discipline, and for giving the student 
a survey of the whole field of human learning—the relation of this to the speciali- 
zation of the activities of the student in lines of original research. One party in 
higher education will contend that the old college course should be retained, and 
held to its purpose of giving unity and consistency to the knowledge of the student 
before he enters on his specialties, whether law, medicine, divinity, or some special 
branch of science or art; the other party will contend for a policy that discounts 
the so-called liberal education, and the boasted advantages of a prolonged study of 
the classical languages and pure mathematics, and contend for the earlier introduc- 
tion of specialization. 
The department congress of technology has prepared for itself a highly valuable 
series of discussions on the educational value of such branches as workshop prac- 
tice, laboratory work in exact measurement, in chemistry, in electricity; what the 
student gets from mechanical and architectual drawing, and from pure and applied 
mathematics, what from natural science, and what from his training for an engineer. 
These studies in educational values have a direct bearing on the most fundamental 
question of higher education—the question whether the course of study in our col- 
_ leges merits the high claims made for it as being one of a specially high educational 
value; as being, in fact, the course that enlightens the student, and gives him bal- 
ance of mind and a judicial habit of thought. 
To this great question in higher education, also, the congress of secondary educa- 
tion contributes its quota by setting in the foreground questions of the practical 
value of science as an educative study as compared with language, and, further- 
more, the value of the modern languages as compared with Latin and Greek. 
This question of the educational value of the classic and modern studies, of the lan- 
guages versus the sciences and mathematics, is not a local one, of interest only to our 
people, but a question more and more coming to the front in France and England, 
and even in Germany; and we are fortunate in having with us distinguished dele- 
gates from all those countries who have weighty words to say in its discussion. 
A kindred question occupies a portion of the programme of the congress of eie- 
mentary education. What branches of science and what branches of industrial 
instruction should be introduced into the elementary schools, and how far may the 
old course of study in language, numbers, geography, and history be made to recede 
to give room for the new branches? The department congresses of industrial and 
manual instruction, together with the congresses on art instruction and music, 
emphasizes this question in elementary education, and repeat in many new phases 
the demand for broadening the course of study in elementary schools, 
The National Geographic Society has been invited to occupy the programme of 
Thursday in the elementary department, and valuable discussions are provided to 
bring out the needs and defects of the present methods of instruction, together 
with the desired remedies. 
But the discussions of the third day in the elementary congress relate to the most 
important of all topics, that of citizenship and morals. 
Those familiar with the work of the directors of popular cducation abroad, 
especially in England, France, and Germany, know the stress that is laid on morals 
and citizenship, and the interest that is shown in questions of religious education 
as an essential item on the programmes of the schools. There are two parties of 
earnest men and women, the one holding that the separation of church and state 
should Le carried so far as to make the schools entirely secular, and the other hold- 
ing that instruction in religion should be placed on the programme side by side with 
instruction in language and science. 
Somewhat related to this question of cthical and civic instruction are most of the 
questions taken up in the kindergarten congress. The kindergarten attempts to pro- 
vide a course of instruction that is half school and half family nurture, in order that 
the rigid discipline in obedience to law and order which characterized, and, I may 
say, still characterizes, the old-time primary school, may not have the effect of chill- 
ing the enthusiasm of the young child and arresting his development along lines of 
growth that tend to a completer individuality and a higher type of manhood and

“womanhood. In the discussions of the week there is a large space given to the very 
important differences between the epochs of childhood, say from 4 to 6 years, and the 
epoch of youth, say from 7 to 14 years.” The transition of the mind from the so-called 
symbolic stage of childhood to the stage in which the child can readily learn the 
conventional methods of representing language and numbers is the topic which needs 
most illumination in the study of methods of the primary school. The kindergar- 
ten, moreover, as containing the beginnings of all that is to be unfolded in the later 
schools, takes up again the question of the educative valuo of hand occupations, so 
often discussed in other departments and found to be so attractive a topic in the 
educational conferences of all nations. 
The congress on the professional training of teachers has as its most important 
topic the difference between the normal school which prepares teachers for the 
work of the elementary schools and the college or university which gives the degree 
of doctor of pedagogy. The course of study in the regular normal school, on the 
other hand, is defined by contrast with the ordinary high school or academy (second- 
ary schools), and it is claimed that the normal school introduces comparative 
study—like the college, seeking to understand each branch in the light of the other 
branches of human learning—while secondary education usually teaches its branches 
as steps to higher studies, and not by a comparative method. 
The college or univ ersity course in pedagogy, it is contended, should make its 
degree stand for original work of investigation in the lines of the literature and 
history of education as well as in lines of investigation into the growth or cevalen 
ment of the child physically and mentally. 
No more important topics than these are on the programme for the week as ; regards 
the improvement of our teachers. 
But there are two department congresses auxiliary to this department of profes- 
sional training, the one on rational psychology, which considers the transient and 
permanent characteristics of mind, seeks to discover the fundamental characteristics 
which contradistinguish mind from mere biological phenomena—the mind as know- 
ing primitive truth and as pure self-activity. The other congress, that of experi- 
mental psychology, devotes all its discussions to questions of child study in physical, 
emotional, intellectual, and volitional aspects. 
‘The teacher, it is said, should understand psychology because he deals with the 
growth of the mind. It is quite recent that a great revival has begun in this country 
of the study of psychology. 
The supervision of schools, which becomes every day more important as people 
come to live more and more in cities and villages, discusses the questions relating to 
the organization of schools, especially such as relate to the examination of teachers 
and the improvement of their work. 
An interesting question, especially interesting in the presence of this great World’s 
Exposition of the products of human industry, is that of the tion of technical 
skill and manual processes to the training of the wsthetic sense—the cultivation of 
the taste for the beautiful. 
This question is brought out in many of its phases in the congress on art instruc- 
tion, and still more of its phases are taken up in the congress on industrial and 
manual instruction. 
The difference between the great systems of training—those of the Swedish Sléjd, 
the Russian school-shop, and the nch system—will be better understood, it is 
believed, at the close of these discussions, and that this will lead to more profitable 
methods of preparation for our industries. 
The department congresses of physical education, of educational publications, of 
vocal music, and of business edue ation, have prepared pointed questions reiating to 
methods and modes of management, and their programmes will invite large audiences 
of interested teachers, 
With this brief sketch of the points in the programme herewith presented, I beg 
leave to thank you, Mr. President of the World’s Congress Auxiliary, and through 
you, your aids and assistants in the local committees of education, for your uniform 
kindness and helpfulness in arranging the details of this congress. I thank you in 
behalf of the committee of arrangements, and in behalf of the National Educational 
Association. 
           
ADDRESS BY DR. JAMES B. ANGELL, PERMANENT CHAIRMAN. 
I think you will all agree with me that the work of these educational congresses 
underlies, in some sense, the work of ali the other congresses which have been or 
which may be held at this time. Perhaps I might better say that.the work of this 
congress overarches, enfolds, and encompasses “the work of all the other congresses, 
as the sky encompasses and enfolds the earth; forall art, and all sciences—what hope 
of progress have these, what hope of perpetuity have they , except as the moral and 
intellectual discipline which we are engaged in cultivating is preserved?

    442 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
As we walk through the avenues of the “‘ White City,” and stand fascinated and 
enchanted with the splendid architecture upon the right hand and upon the left, and 
behold the marvelous collection of the works of industry and of art from all parts 
of the civilized and from many parts of the uncivilized world, think you there is not 
one of us who has not at times felt the inexpressible pathos of the thought which 
has brought tears to so many eyes—the thought that in four short months all this 
architecture and all this marvelous collection of all the treasures of industry and 
of art shall have vanished forever, like the unsubstantial fabric of a vision, leav- 
ing not a rack behind? But the intelligence which has formed them, the genius 
which has fashioned them, the great ideas which are incorporated in them—these 
abide and shall abide forever and forever; and it is to these that you and I and every 
teacher address our work day by day, We work in that which is eternal and which 
shall never pass away. Therefore it is, I think, that the interest in education is so 
abiding, is so widespread, is so universal to-day in eyery part of the civilized globe. 
Therefore it is that to- day our distinguished friends come to us, having made the 
dreary voyage across the wide waste of seas, and haying made the journey across 
half the continent, to speak to us, in sympathy and in love, of those things which 
are dear to us and dear to them. We are glad for their presence here to-night; we 
desire to thank them for their kindness in coming to us. The names and works of 
some of them have long been known to us, and we give them thanks, and we give 
God thanks that now their faces and their voices are to be familiar to us, to give us 
an inspiration, here and now, which shall be with us as a joyous memory and a heip 
forevermore. 
Never before was interest in educational things so widespread within the borders 
of our own land. The last two decades have been creative decades in the work of 
education. Even in the South, which so long lagged behind the North and West, 
what a change there has been since the war! Out of the very depths of a misery 
and a poverty which we in the North can not begin to understand, they too have 
taken up these great ideas of public education, and have taxed themselv, es, with a 
generosity which we can not but admire, for the education both of the white andthe 
black. [Applause.] 
It was not long since that I had a conversation with a gentleman who has done 
more than almost any other for the promotion of education in the South; a prolonged 
eonversation, running until midnight, discussing the practical and difficult problems 
of the South with a pathos and an earnestness which I shali never forget. At the 
close of the hours I said to him: ‘What remedy have you for these terrible problems 
with which you are confronted there?” He arose, with an expression of anguish, 
through which yet there was a ray of hope in his face, and with a fervor and an 
earnestness which I shall never forget, stamping his foot upon the floor, said: ‘Itis 
very dark; we can hardly see an arm’s length before us; but one thing I know; it 
must be eternally right to educate the negro, to educate and Christianize the negro.” 
[Applause.] 
Inno subject has there been greater advancement made in the last two decades 
than in education: how it has been studied historically; how it has been studied 
psychologically ; how it has been studied experimentally. Scientific education has 
been really created in the United States within the last thirty years. The changes 
in the college methods of education have been so great within thirty years as to be 
described by no other name, justly, except that of revolution. Now all the lar ger 
colleges and universities are bending their energies to the cultivation of graduate 
work, that we may achieve something that may truly be called university work in 
our larger and stronger institutions. ° And now I hope, as we have come here, we shall 
get many results from this meeting. 
Never was there a programme, I believe, prepared with such care and with such 
promise as that into w. hich our distinguished friend, Dr. Harris, has thrown his genins 
and his labor. [Applause.] Where, if ever, has there been such an assemblage of 
men and women distinguished by experience and study to instruct us in the diseus- 
sion of the subjects of that programme ? And T hope that among all the other results 
that we shall gain we shall gain this one, viz: to feel the common consciousness of 
unity among all the grades and ranks of teachers from the highest to the lowest. Let 
us feel that our work is one work. We have wrought too simuch in this country in 
sections, and at cross-purposes, and with a lack of common consciousness and unity 
of aim. 
The old-fashioned college, when I was a boy, was a sort of mythical institution 
that stood away in the clouds, remote from connection with the common schools, and 
even with the secondary schools, and the great mass of boys and girls had not a much 
more distinct idea of at went on within its walls than ‘they have of what goes on 
in the mosque at Mecca to-night. Thank God that day of isolation of the college is 
passed. But we still have room to draw tho ranks closer together all the way from 
the women in the kindergarten up to the very highest teacher in the univ: ersity, and 
to have a consecutiveness of purpose and of aim ‘and methods that shall bring us all 
         
      
   
 
-P-A-G-E-453

to one result. For my own part, I never looked upon a woman teaching a primary 
class of 20 pupils, or a woman teaching a class of a like number in the kindergarten, 
without having a feeling akin to reverence for her in her work, and I have often said 
that it seems to me that many of them display more genius than I have ever been 
able to show in trying to manage a university. I have great respect for them, and I 
hope that we shall go out from these meetings with a stronger feeling than we haye 
ever had before that our work is one work from the beginning to the end. Therefore 
let us go back to our schoolhouses and to our class rooms with a strength and an 
inspiration of that mighty consciousness, that we are, everyone of us, a part of the 
great army whose thundering tread is shaking the land. Let us go feeling this 
power, and that we are working as a part of it. [Applause.] 
I want even our humble teachers to have some higher appreciation of the honor 
and dignity that belongs to their work. As they come here and see the noble army 
of men and women engaged in it, I can not but think that they may return to their 
work with some new pride init. Let them reflect for a moment what is the dignity 
.and grandeur of the material upon which they work. It is the soul, the mind of the 
child, infinitely nobler than the canvass on which Raphael painted the Madonna with 
a purity born in heaven; purer and nobler than the whitest Italian marble from 
which Michael Angelo freed from its imprisonment the form of a Moses or of a David. 
The materials with which they work are not the mere pigments of the painter or the 
chisel of the sculptor, but the humblest ‘‘schoolmarm,” the humblest kindergartner 
that is trying to teach her child some idea of geometrical forms, should remember 
that she is planting forever in his mind one of the great ideas by which God has 
builded the world. The humblest ‘‘schoolmarm” in the remotest log house in north- 
ern Michigan or Wisconsin should remember that when she is teaching the A-B’s to 
the stammering boy at her feet she is placing before him a ladder on which he may 
yet climb to the stars. That is the work in which you are engaged. Be proud of it! 
Never be ashamed of it! The rewards in money are small, but the rewards in grati- 
tude and love of your disciples are beyond the purchasing power of gold. The, 
teacher’s profession is a fountain of youth. I have seen many a teacher with gray; 
hairs, and some with bald heads, but I never saw an old teacher yet. The smile and 
play,of youth are ever on his face, because he is ever associated with the child and 
thinking the glad and happy thoughts of children. 
Weare apt to think that our work is too transitory and that to-morrow it is for- 
gotten; put please remember that the most enduring institutions which the human 
race has ever established on earth are the schools, colleges, and universities. Great 
royal houses have risen and fallen, but schools have survived them. Winchester and 
Eton, Oxford and Cambridge have survived how many a royal line in England! The 
educational institutions of France have outlived how many a change of government, 
monarchical and republican! The educational institutions of Europe have seen the 
map of that country made and remade how many times! Everything in Europe has 
changed over and over again except the great schools, colleges, and universities; 
but there they stand, and there they are destined to stand so long as civilization 
endures. . 
Ihope that Iam right as a prophet when I venture to predict that even thongh 
nothing else shall endure in these United States, beyond all the changes of political 
parties, beyond all the changes of society, beyond all the changes of other human 
affairs, the one thing that is to endure, in my judgment, is our great, free, generous 
system of public instruction. [Applause.] Parties may come and parties may 
go, but woe be to any party or any company or any society that with ruthless and 
profane hands dares to lay hold of that institution for its injury or destruction! 
[Applause. ] 
And, my friends, we are proud to come here to-night, representative of many lands, 
representative of many States in this land, all fired with the same love of this one 
great theme. May all see the vision of blessings to come in the future from our toil! 
Let us, I pray you, address ourselves to this work in this high and hopeful spirit 
to-night, believing that God’s blessing will rest with it even to the end. [Applause.]

THE EXHIBIT OF EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 
By Dr. Jonn Eaton, 
Ex-United States Commissioner of Education. 
Educators largely occupied with eternal verities may become too much absorbed 
in what the past is supposed to have fixed, and thus fail to meet current demands, 
or,as the phrase has it, to keep up with the times. They may well recall that no 
body in the stellar world, coursing through its orbit according to immutable laws, 
fails to respond to the influence of the most capricious comet that crosses its course. 
Nor should educators be less ready to gain all possible benefits from the events which 
cross their path. They can not afford to ignore the epoch-making Columbian Fair. 
For the teacher it has not only the lessons it offers to all; it has also the great studies 
in his special duties. In speaking with this emphasis, do not let me be understood 
as implying that he will experience no disappointments. If we expect it to be 
ideally perfect our disappointments will be many. If we expect all nations to be 
officially present or those which participate to exhibit all their attainments propor- 
tionately, we will carry away with us a very different idea. While we hear in 
connection with it so much of progress, we must not forget that motives of gain, of 
selfishness, will be present as in all human affairs. It will cost money and money 
must be made. But we shail be able to see more than ever before of what man has 
accomplished in his various spheres of activity. We might take a trip around the 
world and fail of opportunities to study great human conditions offered here. We 
may see specimens of minerals, soils, plants, animals, wild and domestic, races of 
men, their dress, their houses, something of their family life and vocations, the 
products of their industries, their modes of travel, their science and art. 
Suppose we have studied the map, located the buildings, and taken a ride around 
on the intramural electric railway, and sought to familiarize our eyes with the 
grounds and the exterior of the buildings. Whata transformation of the lagoons 
and sand banks of a few years ayo. Whatever the management may have lacked, 
they had the sense to employ the best skill in landscape architecture and responsive 
skill in the erection of the buildings, and the result is a white city, to be while it 
lasts the marvel of the world and when it disappears an inspiring memory as long 
as the idea of its combination of land and water, of surface and form and ornamen- 
tation abide in human thought. *    
445  
-P-A-G-E-456
446 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  We shall not fail to understand that we have undertaken a most serious task, 
when we learn that the exhibits inviting our study fill buildings with a floor space 
of 210 acres. If we undertake our educational study on an ordinary day, we find 
ourselves in the midst of a moving tide of people of all ages and all conditions of 
intelligence, but uniformly bearing the marks of freedom and comfort, a good- 
natured, eager, orderly crowd, embodying for the educator more suggestive thoughts 
than all else around. We can neither mingle in the throng nor look upon it without 
being filled with meditations upon the deepest educational problems and the effects 
of their solutions upon man’s ‘destiny. These are the people that kaye made the 
Fair possible, nay, they have made it what it is, and they have come here to gather 
its frnits—to determine what its educative force shall be for this and coming gen- 
erations; and these people are the workmanship of the Almighty and education. 
In them we may study the work of the teacher as nowhere else. If the date on 
which we approach the educational exhibit is Chicago day, then our thoughts can 
find no adequate expression. Seven hundred and fifty thousand men, women, and 
children brought together in so few hours in so limited a space for such an object. 
There was never a parallel.. Haye we ever given up our souls to the influence of 
the mighty forces of nature—the influence of the boundless forest, the measureless 
prairie, the torrent of Niagara, or the fathomless ocean? Here in this presence not 
only a mighty material mass lays upon us aresistless, unutterable power, but we 
feel that there is in it a spirit with a destiny above it—a spirit to abide when all 
else that is visible disappears, to triumph over the wreck of worlds, godlike in its 
possibilities and godward in its aspirations, which it is our duty to promote. For 
this purpose we are teachers. 
Leaving the ee evening, my route lead me by the model Sunday-school 
house, located on the side of the street opposite the grounds of the Fair, in which 
Mr. Moody, or some of his assistants, held evenitig services. On entering I found a 
large and attentive worshiping assembly, in spite of the tide that had brought the 
multitudes together within the exhibition as waters rush into an irresistible whirl- 
pool. Here, I said, is a lesson in the power of religion in American education, and 
not unlike that other manifestation of that religious sentiment which surprised so 
many by rejecting Sunday opening. 
Before leaving this thought of the effect of education upon the multitudes of 
visitors, you will pardon me in giving this personal testimony, that, in my duties 
about the Fair, from the middle of July until the end of November, I never saw 
a case of disorder or a drunken person on the grounds, and I may add that officials 
reported that the total number of arrests during the progress of the Exposition 
did not reach 150, Although all I am saying is about the Exposition and education, 
we are after something more specifically educational. Where shall we look for it? 
Where shall we find the exhibit of the vocation of education in which so large 
numbers are engaged all over the world in every civilized land, in whose hands are 
not the materials or machinery of mineral, agricultural, or manufactured products, 
but the children—the real, veritable children being taught throughout the world— 
and through whose hands, as clay in the hands of the potter, all these have been 
taught, whose acquirements are now triumphant in the exhibits of enterprise, 
patience, skill, and art installed around us? Where shall we find the exhibit of 
this the teachers’ vocation—the conditions, appliances, results of this vocation, so 
central and causative to all other human callings and activities? Already we have 
found our way through the Administration Building. Before us js the grand plaza, 
the court of nations, the statue of Columbus and of the Republic, the marvelous 
fountains—beautiful, wonderful. But there are no educational exhibits here. 
Looking to the left, to the entrance of that great building, we see a statue of a man 
of marked intelligence and aspirations; perhaps he was a schoolmaster, but we see 
a Inte in his hand, and know it is Franklin. He is just calling lightning from 
heaven, and around him are other names pointing to the scientific results of educa-

tion. This great building is devoted to electricity. Whata story it tells of the 
progress of half a generation! What have the teachers of electricity accom- 
plished?—but there is no room for them here. We must hunt their place. They 
will be given at least a corner, or a tefit, or a-tree, as were teachers with their con- 
trabands. If there is any teaching actually on exhibition, if there are any live 
illustrations, we are ready to hunt them. We will call a Columbian guard, who 
knows.and will tell where-everything is. Yes, we will find kindergarten in-opera- 
tion in the Illinois Building and in the Children’s Building, and there, too, we may 
study the eréche or day nursery. and Miss Huntington’s kitchen garden in full oper- 
ation. Also, the instruction in sloyd, aided by Mrs. Shaw; and in another room 
that triumph of patience and pedagogical skill, Miss MeGowan’s school for teaching 
deaf mutes to speak in infancy, or that of Miss Garret, of Philadelphia, now sup- 
ported by the State of Pennsylvania. Yes, here too lively boys are practising ina 
gymnasium. Then, tramping down near ‘Krupp’s guns, we may inspect a swimming 
school, and over the way, in a Government ‘building, an Indian school in actual 
operation. After another long ‘tramn, we find, near the Swedish pavilion, the Ling 
system of physical.culture. We want healthy bodies for our people, and yet we can 
hardly delay to hear that in this system the movements, in their nature and their 
number, are founded on the human organisms’ natural means of exercise, and ‘the 
possibility of its perfect development to health and capability of work. Gymmnas- 
tics can also :preserve a development already gained. The aim of these gymnastics 
is to obtain as perfect health as possible; that-is, a harmony between the different 
organs and their functions. Skillfulness, that is, lifting a given weight or the like, 
has but asecondary place, but it is obvious that the human body will best receive 
the harmonious development for which it is fitted when the organism itself is:used 
in its own perfection in relation to physiological laws. On this principle the exer- 
cises are grouped and classified. Ling believed that he could discriminate 11,000 
separate muscular movements. He believed that health was :promoted by their 
exercise, and said if the person is too feeble, or the will is unable to direct the exer- 
cise, then the production of that exercise or motion by another person, or by 
machinery, will promote health or perhaps prevent disease, and hence comes 
massage. 
We-ean not pause further to study the several systems of physical culture that 
challenge our attention. Perhaps now we will take a turn in Midway. Here in the 
Irish Village and in Donegal Castle we may examine the much-needed application 
of instruction to the improvement-of Irish industries. In the school in the Streets 
of Cairo the pupils are seated on the floor, after the, oriental fashion, and studying 
aloud. If we choose, before leaving Midway we may compare the influence of 
training upon wild animals, such as the lion and ostrich. Perhaps ‘this isthe hour 
‘to cross the grounds and witness the training in the Life-Saving Service; or under 
the War Department, the instruction in making firearms, or in signaling by the use 
of the balloon, or-of the-sunlight, that flashes its messages to the distance of 100 
miles. Now it maybe the hour for lunch, and we will hasten to the Rumford 
Kitchen and take a lesson in Mrs. Richards’s scientific cookery, and before leaving 
this section we will listen to the attempt to establish instruction in road building, 
and witness Professor Hazen’s efforts to train engineers in the destruction of sewage 
or of the waste of cities, which is so consummately conducted for the benefit of the 
health of all visitors at the Fair. Already we have notes of numerous instructive 
lectures by eminent experts on manifold industries and arts represented, but wo 
can only give them attention when we wish to take an hour for rest. 
To-day we will examine the Military Academy at West Point as presented by the 
cadetsnow incamp Later we shall have an.opportunity to see tho living illustra- 
tion of the work: done by Captain Pratt at the Carlisle Indian School, represented 
by their band of music and 500 of the students; besides, we must find an hour'to 
examine the work done in American business colleges as represented by banking 
and exchange in actual operation. 
   
-P-A-G-E-458
    448 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
We turn from all these live exhibits disappointed that there is so little of what 
could well be exhibited, but thankful that there is so much, though it is so widely 
scattered. 
We must seize a moment to examine training in fish-culture in the Agricultural 
Department, or instruction in bacteriology in the laboratory of the Marine-Hospital 
Service, or the Surgeon-General’s Office of the War Department, and when we are 
ready for a tramp we will go to the Anthropological Building and witness experi- 
ments in the psychological laboratory. 
Let us now try for the inanimate exhibits. Here there is greater disappointment; 
space is wanting and system and unity are in a measure destroyed. Nations are 
omitted and subjects are only partially exhibited. Only about three-fourths of our 
American States exhibit their public school system—some of these only partially 
andnone completely. But, with all our disappointment, we have never had a better 
opportunity to study education. Any one at any time may examine its statistics, 
history, and literature in the United States Bureau of Education as nowhere else in 
the world, but here are illustrations of buildings, specimens of appliances, and col- 
lections of students’ work and a variety of data never before offered for examination. 
Altogether it suggests forcibly what adequate space and generous treatment of edu- 
cation might have accomplished. We shall have no lack of tramping. We must go 
to the Anthropological Building for reformatory education and instruction in sani- 
tation, then to the building of the French colonies for their school work. Far apart 
in the Agricultural Building we shall find the school exhibit of Uruguay, and what 
there is from Liberia, and that remarkable exhibit from the greatest of English 
experimental farms, and from our own colleges of agriculture. In the Swedish 
pavilion we can take note of the Lundin system of sloyd for girls—the measuring, 
cutting, and making of garments in Sweden—and in another hall or alcove the work 
of the Niiis school. Here there is a most instructive study of the abnormal positions 
of workers in wood and metal, contrasted with those positions which after careful 
investigation are found_to be best adapted to health. 
We shall want to take time for the exhibit of the Bureau of Education in the 
United States Government Building. Here a young gentleman and lady will make 
ample explanations, but the limited space is packed. Here are statistics, history, 
literature, and articles illustrative of conditions of education that can only be mas- 
tered in time. 
In the Woman’s Building we have a considerable space given to the representation 
of institutions devoted to woman’s education, academic, professional, and industrial ; 
and in the educational section a rare collective exhibit of schools for nurses, and 
from Germany some specially successful girls’ industrial schools and specimens and 
studies in the development of woman’s industrial work, going back to the Middle 
Ages. From Spain comes the work of schools for the defective classes, under the 
patronage of women. Before leaving this building we must not fail to take into 
account woman’s work in libraries, in literature and science, as well as instruction 
in art. When not too weary, we can take a run to the State buildings of Washing- 
ton, California, and Illinois, and learn the story of their education from their school 
exhibits. Kansas and California we shall find divided between their State buildings 
and the educational section of the Liberal Arts Building. 
Here we are at last with a great body of educational exhibits before us, and yet 
here the Argentine Republic is crowded into a distant alcove and only partly 
unpacked, and that from Japan must be found in three widely separate localities; 
France can only set up part of its exhibit, and yet a portion of that, illustrating 
industrial work in Paris, must go to its pavilion; Germany, with its rich display, to 
treat it with any justice, must erect another story over the floor space assigned it. 
Itis doubtful whether many of us would agree upon the same plan of investiga- 
tion. One would proceed by subdivision, taking first, the foreign; second, the 
American public school and advanced work; third, Catholic schools; fourth, educa- 
 
-P-A-G-E-459
    
AMERICAN VIEWS OF THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 449 
tion of defective classes; fifth, business colleges; sixth, Indian education; seventh 
education as promoted by voluntary associations, such as the Israelite Alliance, or 
the Temperance Union; eighth, as illustrated by business enterprises such as those 
which furnish the text-books, represented by various publishers, or furniture, repre- 
sented by manufacturers, or apparatus, or illustrations, such as represented by Ward, 
of Rochester, or Queen & Co., of Philadelphia, or Milton Bradley, of Springfield, 
Mass., or Steiger, of New York, or buildings as represented by different firms of archi- 
tects. Another may choose to make the teacher, his preparation and methods, the 
center and beginning of his thought. Another may take up the work by grades. 
One would begin with the kindergarten and go upward; another with the profes- 
sional school and go downward; another may ehoose to trace ideas and their devel- 
opment in the history of education. Perhaps he finds the germ, or seed-thought, of 
a movement in the mind of some philanthropic educator and traces it through its 
periods of quiet and agitation until realized in legislation and the administration of 
systems or the adoption of principles or methods or the establishment of institutions. 
Another may prefer to begin with the enactment of law and trace its operations in 
schools and its results in the customs and industries of the people. Another would 
prefer to spend time in tracing the development of methods and principles, systems 
and institutions, in different nations and races, the influence upon education of a 
nation such as Prussia, or of individuals such as Socrates, or Quintilian, or Come- 
nius, or Bacon, or Rousseau, or Pestalozzi, or Froebel, or Horace Mann, or Barnes, or 
Sears, or Henry Barnard, or of the distinctive schools of thought or of philosophy. 
Whatever course we pursue, we must never part with the historic and comparative 
method, two most essential conditions of the best results, alike for teacher, pupil, 
and investigator. Before us are myriads of pictures, acres of drawings, tons of writ- 
ten work, and car loads of specimens of manual training. Wecan only hint at pos- 
sibilities. The devices used are many and helpful. Here a State tells its statistics 
on a rotating cylinder; graphics are extensively used both in foreign and American 
-exhibits, especially maps, notably by New York, Michigan, and Massachusetts. 
Raised maps are numerous and effective. Denver sends a shorthand report of actual 
daily work in the schoolroom. New Jersey has a special device for packing and 
showing pictures. In several instances the phonograph repeats the actual work of 
classes in reading and music or the lessons of the teacher, and the cunning of the 
instantaneous photograph is beyond measure. Fortunately there is a generous 
amount of explanatory literature which is freely distributed. For many exhibits 
gentlemen and ladies are present ready to answer any questions. Did you ever go 
to the Catholic exhibit without finding either Brother Maurelian or some of his 
numerous assistants? In New York you can have explanations in French. In the 
exhibit of deaf-mute instruction many find added interest in the fact that the attend- 
ant is a graduate of the deaf-mute college and is such a master of articulation that 
he can communicate with you with ease. Connected with Carlisle and Hampton 
exhibits you will meet the Indians they have trained. In Massachusetts you are sure 
at any time to find four, if not five, persons in attendance; for the Institute of Tech- 
nology, an alumnus; for Harvard, Professor Cummings and his wife will speak in 
any language you desire, and for the public schools Miss McDonald and Professor 
Gay will be acknowledged models of tireless courtesy and patience. 
We are fortunate if we study the French exhibit during the visit of Mr. B. Buisson, 
and have the benefit of his explicit explanations. In mastering the large and effective 
German exhibit, we may have the historical and philosophical explanations of the 
eminent Dr. Stephan Waetzoldt, professor of the University of Berlin, and chief com- 
missioner of the Prussian ministry for education. Those who are familiar with the 
indebtedness of American education to Prussia, the eminent masters furnished to our 
schools, and the valuable information we have derived from the system—principles 
and methods from the reports of Stowe, Mann, Bache, and Barnard on Prussian edu- 
cation—will examine the Prussian exhibit with peculiar interest.

      450 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Furniture and text-books, so easily exhibited, are not so fully represented as might 
be expected, either from our own or from other countries. If the German text-books 
are admitted to bear more marks of systematic and patient labor, and the French of 
aseverer logic and a more exquisite esthetic taste, American text-books clearly have 
no superiors in the matter of print, pictorial illustrations, and other characteristics 
of mechanical execution. In the German exhibition there is an ingenious combina- 
tion in a teacher’s desk. It has the usual conveniences for the teacher’s eye and the 
material for his use, but it has also an arrangement connected with its back by which 
he may present to the eye of the class letters, words, figures, sentences, or other 
illustrationswhich he wishes to use in his lessons. 
Educational journalism, both Ambrican and foreign, is present only in limited 
extent. 
Of the exhibition generally, it may be said that representations are limited almost 
entirely to present conditions; grounds, architecture, appliances as they now are, 
the work of students at a single sitting or on a given day, or completed specimens. 
Colorado, however, offers the model of the first district schoolhouse. Princeton, a 
picture of the log college, a model of the grounds and Nassau Mall, and other char- 
acteristics. Dr. Harris, in the exhibit of the Bureau of Education, presents in minia- 
ture models instructive studies in the development of desks and seats; Tlinois shows 
a process of producing stereotyped plates for the blind, reducing the cost per page 
from 75 cents to 15 cents. France shows with effect the progress of a pupil through 
a series of years. Nearly forty years ago a plan was attempted in Toledo for carry- 
ing out the comparison of one year’s result with another during the attendance of 
pupils and classes. Progress in text-books may be studied in the collection exhibited 
by Prof. Jerome Allen or that of Mr. Plympton; in the latter we may find specimens 
in arithmetic, algebra, in. English, French, German, and Latin and Greek—going back 
to and including the New England Primer and the horn book, now so rare to find 
and so diffieult to secure. | 
In the literature and statistics of education there is more opportunity for historic 
comparison. ‘ Sets of the New England Journal of Education recall the fact to the 
eredit of Dr. Bicknell, that, in its establishment, he led the way for educational jour- 
nalism out of subjection to subsidies ‘and limitation to state or specially local cireula- 
tion into effective independence and national circulation, and the constant draft wpon 
information of the progress of education the world over. If we seek the best known 
data on education, from the earliest time to the present, we shall find itin great 
abundance in the full series of volumes found both in the exhibits of Mr. Bardeen 
and the State of Connecticut, and of the American Journal of Education, on which 
Dr. Henry Barnard has expended his fortune and the eminent services of his long 
and useful life. Further historic studies may be made in series of reports presented 
here and there, notably those from Connecticut, Boston, the State of Massachusetts, 
and the Bureau of Education; and those most effective graphic statistics of Harvard, 
in which you may trace the (escent of education by families, or the increase of its 
fands or its attendance, or the influence of a single gift to its library, or of a fund for 
establishing a separate professorship; or in the exhibit by Princeton of the rude 
apparatus used by Henry in establishing the laws of electrical action; or in the 
New York collection, the apparatus used by Draper in his work in photography. 
The organization of education is a study in itself. In the exhibit the demarca- 
tions are easily recognizable. In foreign countries such as Japan, Russia, Austria, 
Sweden, and France, the authority proceeds from a national source. So for England, 
Scotland, Wales, and Ireland, but for the colonies it is colonial. For our country and 
Germany there is not a national system, but education is a function of the respective 
States. 
The Catholic exhibit is divided into archdioceses and dioceses; the schools and 
colleges wnder the respective orders, brotherhoods, and sisterhoods, in‘which cach 
teacher obeys the command of the superior with the fidelity of a soldier.
-P-A-G-E-461
AMERICAN VIEWS OF THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 451 
Among our American States, while to a casual observer there may seem ‘to be exact 
sinilarity, there is really great diversity. From colonial times there has been legis- 
lation with regard to education, but the growth of supervision -by civil authority 
above that of the local civil unit, such as the town in Massachusetts, is of recent 
date. Knowledge of the condition of the education of children, or the intelligence 
of its people, was not what the State concerned itself about. The importance of 
this item of information slowly dawned upon the minds of statesmen. They cared 
most to know how many fighting men there were, and then about property asa basis 
of revenue. After.a time one after another of the earlier States began to require 
reports of the children of school age, of school revenues, ‘and school attendance. 
New York first required supervision, then abolished it,then returned to it; and in 
the exhibition there is disclosed a bifurcated system of State administration of edu- 
eation, one under the board of regents through its secretary and the other under 
the State superintendent of public instruction. The State University under the 
board of regents is an old organization; all institutions of education desiring a 
charter apply to it'and report toit. The State library and museum, university exten- 
sion, and university examinations are under its direction. Under the State superin- 
tendent of public instruction are the public schools of ‘the State, the normal schools 
and teachers’ institutes. All appeals from local administration under the law goto 
him. Under him ‘there is a system of local supervision by commissioners. Cities 
have a self-directed administration and supervision in accordance with the general 
and specific laws enacted by the State to which they are subject. Fora knowledge 
of the education in the State we need ‘the reports of cities and those of the board of 
regents and of the State superintendent. 
In Massachusetts the State administration of education is committed to'a non- 
partisan board nominated by the governor, and confirmed by the council, whose sec- 
retary is theirexecutive officer, The great revival of education in 1837 under Horace 
Mann may be said to have been begun when he became secretary of this board. In 
the report of ‘the secretary, or the State’s report:of education, you find nothing about 
the colleges or the universities. It-confines itself to the public schools, the normal 
schools, and certain academies, and school for the blind, deaf, and feeble minded. 
The authority of the board is extremely limited. Associated with the secretary and 
cooperating with:him is a group of expert lecturers, who together with him address 
meetings, visit schools:and hold conferences with teachers and school officers, Towns 
and cities, as provided by the statutes of the State, levy their school taxes and 
administer their school affairs. Boston early elected as its first superintendent 
Nathan Bishop, who soon retired when John .D. Philbrick was chosen as his suc- 
cessor, under whom the Boston sghools rose to their supreme efficiency as regarded 
by the educators of the world at that date. 
In Pennsylvania the authority is centralized in-a State superintendent of public 
instruction ; local supervision is‘by cities and counties, yet there is no State univer- 
sity, thenearest approach tovit being the college of agriculture and mechanic arts. 
The organization in Ohio corresponds with neither of the States already described. 
This also appears distinctively in its exhibit, which is made by the cities of Cincin- 
nati, Cleveland, and Columbus, and several of the counties by their own action 
respectively. The college of agriculture is becoming a State university, and there 
is lack of county supervision and no State normal school. 
In Michigan the exhibit discloses the lack of executive power in the State school 
office as in Ohio, but reveals a closer relation of the several parts of the system. 
Hereis a great State university, which was'the first in the Union to bring high schools 
into close relation with it. 
In Minnesota, the exhibit shows the close relation of all parts of the public school 
” question, the elementary to the secondary or high schools, and these to the university 
and the normal schools.  
-P-A-G-E-462
  452 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
If we take up method and attempt investigation, we shall perhaps begin with the 
mother tongue. Here we find it in the songs and common language of the kinder- 
garten. Nowhere do we hear the old a-b ab and b-a ba of other days. Everywhere 
there are improved methods. Gieat emphasis is placed on language lessons in the 
most efficient systems, whether foreign or American. Selections are furnished from 
the best authors, sometimes committed to memory, sometimes copied from dictation; 
original compositions are required. In the last twenty years instruction in English 
in different parts of the United States has been entirely revolutionized. 
The different methods are made manifest in the varied exhibits. The diversity is 
hardly less marked in the methods of teaching writing. Some begin at once with 
both pen and pencil, as in Kansas City; others begin with the pencil and later 
introduce the pen, as in Boston. Some contend for the upright lines for writing, 
like England and Canadw and different schools in the United States; and others 
for slant lines, like Germany and many of our own cities and schools. Here, too, is 
every method for teaching arithmetic and geography. Generally speaking, in all 
subjects, from the lowest to the highest, there is manifest improvement; even text- 
books from Turkey are modeled on the best from America. Schools of Egypt exhibit 
the Koran as the book for sacred reading, and show work in manual training and 
letters in accord with the methods prevalent in Euope and America. Behind the 
exhibit from Germany there are the same well-known enforced attendance of pupils 
and universal training of teachers for their professions; more dependence upon the 
teacher and less dependence upon the text-book. Generally the work in Germany 
and France is characterized by systematic illustration in the lower grades. In the 
United States there is abundant evidence that in these grades the abstract method 
is giving way to the concrete. This is especially true in teaching language. The 
improvements in teaching English are most marked. 
In the lack of authoritative co-relation of parts or grades of educational work in 
the United States it is gratifying to see each grade by its own intelligent action 
seeking to come into appropriate sympathetic cooperative relations with every 
other. In our individualism, in which there is such untold advantage in our stand- 
ing apart from each other, it is well to remember that we sometimes stand more 
than erect. We may lean backward. The colleges have too long been responsible 
for the lack of improved methods in teaching, especially for abstract methods in our 
primary schools. Movements like that of Cambridge, in which Harvard University 
seeks to elevate, render philosophical and more nicely adapted to age and environ- 
ment the instruction in elementary subjects, are full of promise. The several exhib- 
its furnish a rich opportunity to study the facts behind the great piece of work done 
by the distinguished committee of ten. 
Everywhere in the American exhibit there is gratifying evidence of increasing 
thoughtfulness, especially of increased accentuation of the importance of improving 
the qualification of teachers. Examinations in knowledge of methods are more care- 
ful. The normal schoois are yielding up more and more the work done in academic 
instruction, and increasing their efforts in pedagogical training. Colleges are adding 
chairs with one designation and another in the theory or history and practice of edu- 
cation. The sui generis exhibit of the Cook County Normal School was much studied 
in the children’s building. The Oswego Normal School, that has done so much to 
bring the principles and methods of Pestalozzi to America, manifestly took the lead 
among the normal school exhibit of New York. 
But individual exhibits must be left to personal examination, nor will time permit 
any estimate of the schools of engineering or technology. It has been remarked 
that the exhibition of the Boston Institute of Technology is so complete and typical 
that, were the institution destroyed, its main features could be reproduced from the 
suggestions of the exhibit; here, too, is the solid work of the institution at Troy, 
dating back to 1826, pointing to the Ferris Wheel, the Brooklyn Bridge, and other
-P-A-G-E-463
  AMERICAN VIEWS OF THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 453 
triumphs of its graduates as evidences of its merits. Nor can we pause to linger 
around the colleges and universities. In these grades of work we are deeply im- 
pressed with the magnificent equipment and thoroughness of university instruction 
in Germany. 
What the exhibition was to foreign educators we must not attempt to describe. 
They specially took in, in connection with the exhibit, what they could see else- 
where in the country, and especially in Chicago. Everywhere they felt the absence 
of the union of church and state, and the absence of militarism, demanding, as on 
the Continent, a portion of all young and vigorous life, and an absence, too, of the 
surrender of the masses to the classes. The number of eminent foreigners who 
visited us was very large. We shall find much in their reports to instruct us. 
Already Compayré has expressed his surprise at the rapid growth of our universi- 
ties and their rich endowment from private sources; and Jules Steeg has declared 
that a part of this portion of our exhibit seemed to him childish. Dr. Waetzoldt 
reports favorably upon our improvements in methods of elementary instruction, 
especially in teaching language. 
Taking the exhibit of education in connection with other portions of the Exposi- 
tion, one can not fail to be impressed with the power of education in saving nations 
from disorder, and imparting to them conditions of national progress, Here we 
may catch hints of evidence that England avoided a foreshadowed revolution by 
aiding industrial and technical education and establishing a system of elementary 
schools; that France in recent years, by an almost superhuman effort, in advancing 
education among the people, has avoided anarchy, and confirmed an orderly repub- 
lic; that Japan by a wise use of education sprung from her seclusion to the front 
rank among nations. We are made to feel the power and unity of education for 
every member of every race, no matter what his characteristics. It means alike for 
the lowest and the highest of every type an enlargement of the boundaries of knowl- 
edge, a training of all the faculties and powers to improved activities, quickening 
the reason, confirming the conscience, and aligning the decisions of every one more 
and more with reason and right. In the provisions for reading beyond the school 
period, we see evidence that France in its recent efforts, and parts of the United 
States, have outstripped other portions of the world. No community of similar 
territory, with equal population, excels Massachusetts in this important means of 
assuring progress of intelligence among the people. Her libraries bring a supply 
of reading matter within the reach of over 97 per cent of her people. In the exhibit 
of the Bureau of Education, by the cooperation of the American Library Associa- 
tion, we may see a model library and its administration, learn about schools for 
librarians, and look up the library question in all its bearings. 
There is general surprise expressed at the great progress of kindergarten and man- 
ual training in the last twenty years in the United States. Whether our stay with 
the exhibit of education is longer or shorter, we shall leave with the opinion that it 
was well to make it; well for schools to prepare for it; well to furnish opportunities. 
to study its principles, methods, and results. For myself, it will be remembered by 
some, when by invitation we discussed the methods of preparation for the exhibit, _ 
that my experience pointed to the best results in the United States by moving under 
the auspices of the National Bureau of Education. This is our national agency, 
equally available for all States, localities, institutions, and interests. And now at 
the close of the exhibition you will allow me to say that these opinions are most fully 
confirmed. 
What the disseminating power of the Fair is to be, no one can fully foresee. It is 
clear, however, that it will be determined largely by yourselves and those like you 
who are appointed to extend their influence into the future by educative processes, 
whether by the arts, or trades, or by speech, or by the press, or the more formal 
processes of direct instruction of* youthful minds. How much of this great respon-
-P-A-G-E-464
  454 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
sthility falls to you was incidentally pointed out in the poetic language of the 
' *.Autoerat of the Breakfast Table” at your last meeting: 
‘Teacher of teachers! Yours the task, 
Noblest that noble minds can ask, 
High up Ionia’s marmorous mount, 
To watch, to guard the sacred fount 
‘That fills tho stream below; 
To guide the hurrying flood that fills 
A thousand silvery rippling rills 
In ever-widening flow.”    
Any visitor to the Fair will often think of Victor Hugo’s declaration that the nine- 
teenth century is woman’s century, and then he will confess, too, that it is the work- 
ingman’s century, and then that it is the child’s century, that its great movement is 
toward a clearer definition and realization of man’s essentials and of his relation as 
child, as man, as woman, to his Creator, and that thus it is promoting the removal 
of artificial burdens and obstructions and making the course clearer for man’s mas- 
tery over nature, and for his triumphant progress in the destiny divinely offered him. 
THE EDUCATIONAL EXHIBIT AT THE WORLD’S COLUMBIAN 
EXPOSITION. 
By Sretim H. PeaBopy, LL. D., 
Chief of Department of Liberal Arts, World’s Columbian Exposition. 
The world has never before seen an exhibit of its educational results so extensive 
or so complete as that shown at the Columbian Exposition. 
Twenty-six foreign nations contributed to the educational exhibit. The principal 
were Germany, France, England, Canada, New South Wales, Russia, Mexico, Brazil, 
and Japan. 
Thirty-two States sent collective exhibits. Forty-four were in some way repre- 
sented. Illinois and California were compelled by the conditions of their State 
appropriations to make their exhibits in their own State buildings. We greatly 
regretted their absence, as well as the defection of the agricultural colleges. Above 
all should we have rejoiced if the Bureau of Education could have occupied an 
appropriate and significant space as the central figure of all American education. 
‘Contributions to the American exhibits came from 1,150 cities and towns, 271 
counties, 756 academies and private schools, 53 schools for the defective classes, 25 
business colleges, 39 manual training schools, 20 art schools, 51 normal schools, and 
146 universities and colleges. 
Among the foreign exhibits that of first importance came from the German Empire. 
It was prepared by the minister of education under the sanction of the imperial 
council. It illustrated, first of all, the admirable organization by which that Gov- 
ernment manages its educational affairs. The department of education having an 
organization as complete as that which has made the German army famous, the 
minister proceeded to call for such items as he was pleased to select from the facul- 
ties of universities, the directors of schools of arts and sciences, the principal offi- 
cers of gymnasia, realschulen, and primary schools, for material illustrative of their 
various departments. The most distinguished professors and scientists answered 
with the actual apparatus used in their latest discoveries, contrasted with others of 
historic fame. They sent huge folios containing the plans and elevations of their 
latest achievements in buildings for laboratories, art galleries, and museums; models 
to scale of schoolrooms and furnishings; complete sets of the apparatus furnished 
to their primary schools and gymuasia, for the teaching of the physical sciences; 
diagrams and charts presenting in a few salient points the most impressive educa- 
tional facts of the Empire; histories in many volumes of their great institutions of 
learning; immense folios of examination papers, some taken recently, some in the 
early years of the century.

‘Nothing short of a complete catalogue will enable one to understand the fullness, 
the richness, and the dignity of this wonderful exhibit. The interest in it is not 
diminished when we learn that it was gathered at Berlin within two months after 
orders were given for its collection. 
One of its charts told an impressive story. An account in the nature of debits 
and credits, kept with the Kingdom of Prussia, showed on one ‘side the census of 
children of school age to the number of more tkan 5,000,000 souls; upor the other 
side there were so many accounted for in each department, so many excused for cause, 
so many sick, ‘all save less than 1,000, whom the truant officers had not found. 
The American educator who gave to this exhibit, orto any specialty therein, ear- 
nest and thoughtful study, could not fail to derive information and inspiration of the 
highest value. He would also observe the general absence of two ‘sorts of exhibits 
which were so much in evidence in the American section—those of shop training’and 
the kindergarten. The sacrifices made to give this exhibit space were surely repaid 
a thousand times. 
The French commission presented the most elaborate display of advanced engineer- 
ing shopwork shown in the Fair, some good elementary art work, a full collection 
of the literature of the ministry of education, and ‘an excellent exhibit from the 
public schools of the city of Paris. 
As had been expected, the Russian exhibit was quite complete and fall of interest. 
Those who remembered the impetus given to shop instruction in America by the 
Russian exhibit at the Centennial, and were anxious to'see what further development 
in ‘this direction that country had to show, were somewhat disappointed. ‘The 
exhibits which had attracted so much attention in 1876 were repeated in 1893, but not 
improved; they were equaled, if not surpassed, by many similar exhibits in the 
American section. The most valuable contribution from Russia was the exhibit of 
girls’ handiwork, brought from the charitable institutions under the patronage of 
the women of the imperial family, and consisting of plain and ornamental needle- 
work and embroidery. The art instruction from Russia was also a subject of special 
interest. 
Forty years ago American ships were knocking at the sealed gates of the Japanese 
Empire. Twenty-five years ago that Empire sent to various Western countries 700 
chosen youths to be educated at the public expense. Last year her accredited 
judges were reporting awards upon American school exhibits. This Exposition is the 
first to which she has sent any educational harvest. Here she showed exhibits from 
astate university, well equipped; from a school of technology, whose president was 
avery able commissioner of her exhibit; from a normal school and an agricultural 
college. By the aid of these schools she is developing her educational system, in 
which she already shows excellent results in primary instruction, and in the lines of 
practical science, manual training, and natural history. She is proceeding in a log- 
ical method, and is‘rapidly filling up all the gaps between her primary and her higher 
schools. 
An exhibit of much interest came from Egypt, from Cairo, and neighboring towns. 
It consisted of mantal work in iron and wood, the latter elegantly inlaid in the 
Arabic manner; physical apparatus made by pupils; drawing, in variety, well exe- 
euted; writing in English and Arabic, with inscriptions emblazoned from the Koran, 
etc. Most of this work compared favorably with that done in our best schools, and 
some could not there be paralleled. Thus is the droxaréortow complete. Science . 
and education return in full circuit to their birthplace by the tombs of the Pharaohs. 
The State collective exhibits were notable for their general excellence and for 
their infinite variety. Thirty-two States could not provide exhibits which would 
cover interests so similar, without a degree of sameness, but the predicated barren 
iteration did not appear. In almost every case the inventive genius of the commit- 
tee in charge worked out some novel and effective feature, as illustrated by the 
stenographic Teports from the schoolroom, suggested by Mr. Gove, of Denver, and     
 
-P-A-G-E-466
456 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
the phonographic tubes from New York and Wisconsin. Probably neither of these 
devices reveals exactly what it is intended to represent any more than photography 
does. One has to be urged to “look pleasant” before the camera; and if the voice 
of the worried and forgetful teacher should become high and strident, the phono- 
graph which omits that episode will be pardoned. Both these devices are ingenious, 
newly applied, and worthy of repetition, 
The chief criticism upon the State exhibits is that too many of them failed to indi- 
cate the existence of a well-organized and active system which provides for the 
wants of the State asa whole. Some of them presented only a series of city exhibits, 
which were as distinct as beads upon a string. The rural schools were not suffi- 
ciently in evidence. It is true that in some cases the State organizers could not 
arrange their exhibits otherwise; first, because they could not secure funds for their 
work if done in any other way, but mainly because there was no general organ 
tion to be represented. In this respect the contrast between some of our exhibits 
and that presented by the German nation is very great and is much to our disad- 
vantage. 
As to the use of collections of written examination papers, themes, and drawings, 
the suggestion has been made that they have proved worthless and will never again 
be made part of an educational exhibit. But those who came as accredited exam- 
iners from abroad, like the German commissioners, or the special agents sent by the 
city of Paris without exception, made more careful studies of these papers than of 
any other elements of our exhibits. Many requests were made for examples of such 
papers, to be taken home as additions to pedagogical libraries. It was after reading 
these papers that Dr. Waetzoldt, the distinguished German commissioner, made the 
following statement as to the worthy results of American education. He said: 
“Tn teaching language, drawing, and modeling the Americans are superior to the 
Germans. It is surprising what a command of language the American school chil- 
dren have. German teachers dwell too much upon style and literary models, while 
American teachers aim to give the children a practical command of the language.” 
No more notable illustration of the trend of American effort since 1876 appeared 
than in the exhibits of the kindergarten and the manual training schools. It is not 
unfair to say that these subjects were more in evidence in the Exposition than was 
warranted by their existence in the schools. This happened quite naturally. First, 
because these are among the newest things which have occupied the public mind. 
Teachers of these specialties were anxious to have the fact known, especially by 
foreign visitors, who should thus learn that we are abreast of the most advanced 
movement. Second, nothing which the teacher has to show lends itself to exhibi- 
tion so kindly as do these products. They are far better than the work of art classes, 
for they do not include so many ghastly failures. 
The archbishops of the Roman Catholic Church in America recognized the oppor- 
tunity which the Exposition offered them for presenting the kind of education which 
they would make popular, and their claims for it in comparison with that of the 
State schools under State supervision. Brother Maurelian deserves congratulation 
for his very notable success. He used the far-reaching organization of his church 
in securing contributions from 37 States and Territories, 57 dioceses, 412 cities and 
towns, and about 1,200 schools of all grades from the humblest parish schools to the 
university at Washington. In a great abundance and variety of material the promi- 
nent features were the work of the primary or parish schools, with art and needle, 
work as taught in the convents and seminaries. So far as prestige is concerned, the 
public State school has not suffered in the comparison. 
The following items will express some of the directions in which our American 
education has made progress since the last great American Exposition, as illustrated 
in that which has just closed. 
(1) Very marked progress in the development of the university as compared with 
the college. While only part of our great institutions presented exhibits, these 
     
-P-A-G-E-467
         AMERICAN VIEWS OF THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 457 
illustrated the best phases of such work, in a congeries of exhibits whose merits 
grew upon one during every day of the Fair, and do not suffer now that reality has 
faded into memory. Post graduate work, the seminary, personal investigation on 
the part of both professor and pupil, the endowment of research as well as the 
endowment of instruction, each energizing the other in the development of either 
the sciences or the humanities—these are some of the flowers and fruit which dignify 
and elevate our university work. 
(2) The development of the university extension and Chautauquan methods. 
(3) A large increase in the number of normal schools, and the evidence of power 
derived from their methods of instruction, diffused through the public schools. This 
appears to be.a most potent factor in the elevation of public school work. 
(4) The strong, united, and systematic character of the exhibit of the business 
colleges. Hitherto these have been deemed a corps of educational free lances, which 
corralled students, roped and branded them, and sent them through a short cut, 
called a business education, to the counting house, the ledger, and perhaps a for- 
tune. On the contrary, this body of teachers laid aside their differences, brought 
together a solid and instructive exhibit, and proved that they give in their own 
field a worthy and useful training. 
(5) The continued establishment and the advanced methods used in teaching the 
blind; the deaf, especially in oral speech; and the remarkable results secured in ele- 
vating the lives of those of feeble minds. 
(6) The manual training school has already been noted, Its progress during the 
last seventeen years has been phenomenal. Thirty-nine distinct manual training 
schools exhibited, besides schools of technology and collegiate technological depart- 
ments in which manual instruction is an integral part of every course. The whole 
exhibit from one end to the other bristled with the work of the tool, from the 
jackiknife to the machine driven by power. 
(7) The trade schools in the large cities have developed rapidly. Trade schools 
teach some kind of work done by the artisan as a means of earning a livelihood; such 
as the trade of the tinsmith, the plumber, the harness maker, the dressmaker, the 
milliner, the cook. Excellent exhibits of this character came from New York, Brook- 
lyn, Cincinnati, and from the Indian schools of Hampton and Carlisle. It is to be 
hoped that these schools will multiply so rapidly that when the walking delegate 
finds them and attempts to put his foot on them, his foot will not be large enough 
for the emergency. 
(8) The foothold which the kindergarten has acquired as the basis of the best pri- 
mary instruction. 
(9) The progress made in the giving of sound instruction as to the evil use of nar- 
cotics and intoxicants. 
(10) The development of art schools in so many important centers, and of art 
instruction in so large a number of the colleges and schools of technology. Much 
good is to be expected from this movement,-especially when it shall have come to 
permeate all our public school work, and after it has risen above conventionalism, 
the impressionist vagary, and the influences which flow into it from French channels. 
(11) The gradual but steady advancement of public school instruction in all parts 
of our land. This advancement will necessarily be slow. It is the resultant of a 
multitude of forces, aiding and opposing each other. It involves the just enlighten- 
ment of the whole people, which must be trained to know the purposes of education, 
the need for it, and the needs of it. I feel confident that the exhibition just closed 
shows—in the kind of work displayed, in the breadth from which it was drawn, in 
the earnest feeling in regard to it, in the multitudes that came to study it, in the 
inspiration that has grown out of it—that the onward march of sound. educational 
ideas in the United States was never so direct, so forceful, and so sure as it is at the 
present time.

EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
THE WORLD'S FAIR. 
  [From the New England Journal of Education.] 
There is nothing more important in the school work of 1893-94 than the utilizing 
of the knowledge and spirit of the Columbian Exposition. It has been instructive 
and inspiring, enlightening and ennobling, a revelation in science and a revolution 
in the arts. 
Geography has its highest aim and noblest purpose when it deals with what men 
have done with the earth,.and upon it, rather than with the earth as it was and is 
and would be untouched by man’s art.and skill. 
History has its highest significance when it is used as the base line from which to 
take measurements and angles into the social, industrial, and political future. His- 
tory faces forward. It is.a fountain and not a crystal, a stream, not a pool. Out of 
a limited past it gives those lessons for which a limitless future hungers. Science 
teaching is not for the purpose of knowing certain laws and principles that have 
been authoritatively recorded, nor is it to know how the teachers and books have 
been accustomed to present certain labeled facts, but it is rather a prophecy, a fore- 
seeing of what will be, or at least may be developed out of or revealed from what is 
known and knowable of the laws and principles of science. 
The Columbian Exposition has taught more geography that is valuable by means 
that are rarest and methods that are choicest than aught else ever conceived by the 
mind of man. It has been a fathomless revelation of what man has done with the 
earth and its resources in different localities and under varying conditions of soil, 
climate, and government. With its record of progress, of the acceleration of a pro- 
gressive spirit with some peoples and of the retarding of progress by others, with 
its revelations of the tendencies as seen in the results of different conditions of race 
and government it has furnished invaluable facts for the student of history. With 
its matchless exhibit of the discoveries and inventions in the arts and sciences-it is 
a vivid panorama of the conquests of man over the forces of nature; of his mastery 
of sun and shadow, of light and heat, of soil and climate, of steam and electricity ; 
of his skillful unlocking of the earth for oil and gas; of his tandem electrical team of 
telegraphy and telephony; of his harnessing the air waves in phonography; of his 
marvelous skill in training the sunlight in the photography of things in the earth 
beneath and in the heavens.above by day or by night. Through this it has presented 
material for the study or teaching of science such as has never been known before. 
With its vivid record of the revolution in the means of transportation by sea and 
land, by steed and steam, it has offered unparalleled advantages for the study of 
commerce, while the highest arts in painting and sculpture, in decoration and adorn- 
ment, in landscape gardening and architecture, in the electrical and pyrotechnic 
illuminations of the fountains and of the heavens, has placed America in her four 
hundredth year above and beyond all other nations in her attainments as well as in 
her record thereof. 
All this should be wtilized so far as it may be through reports and descriptions 
official, reportorial, and literary. The teachers should begin early to-equip them- 
selves for the best possible use of all this material. 
WHAT THE EDUCATIONAL EXHIBIT SHOWS. 
[From the New E: 
  gland Journal of Education. ] 
The educational exhibit at the World’s Fair is the largest and most complete por- 
trayal of educational facilities and results ever made. Nearly every State in the 
Union and many foreign countries show in a complete and satisfactory manner the 
organization, method of instruction, and results obtained in this department of 
statesmanship. The preparation of the material has taken much time and care, its 
installation has involved a great amount of labor, its superintendence requires the 
time and strength of many people.
-P-A-G-E-469
  AMERICAN VIEWS OF THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 459 
The results fully justify the expense involved, and from every point of view are 
gratifying to those who have been interested in the work. It is the purpose of this 
paper to point out a few of the lessons which the display is teaching. 
(1) The first lesson is that the present isa time of high ideals. The work shown is 
often far from perfection, but the most of it is in the line of excellence. Time, effort, 
proper facilities, cooperation will make the ideal real. 
(2) The second lesson is that good work is confined to no one section of the country. 
From Maine to Washington teachers exhibit purposes, methods, and principles that 
are of the highest rank and importance, and pupils send work in which they may 
well take pride. 
(3) The third lesson is that no one city or State has wholly good school work, and 
that, while all have some excellencics, all have defects that need remedy. Maine may 
learn from California, Kansas may learn from Connecticut, Massachusetts may learn 
from Missouri. 
(4) The fourth lesson is that there is no need to raise the question what school chil- 
dren can do; it is sufficiently proved that they can do anything they are likely to be 
asked to do. The real question is, What things can we wisely ask children to do 
and in what order? Here are drawing, sewing, geometry, writing, English compo- 
sition, botany, mineralogy, zoology from pupils of 10 years of age—work that would 
be regarded as creditable from pupils of 16 or 17. 
(5) The fifth lesson, not the least important, is that an exhibition of this character 
has great educational value and interest. The carefully prepared courses of study, 
the schemes of work in every branch of learning, the methods of teaching employed 
by the thousands of teachers throughout the land, the illustrations of school excr- 
cises from the hands of the pupils have high educational value. 
EDUCATIONAL EXHIBITS AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 
By RicuaRD WATERMAN, Jr., in Educational Review. 
I. The educational exhibits at the Columbian Exposition have been inspected and 
studied and discussed by thousands of people during the past five months. ‘They 
present such a wealth of material to illustrate every side of the educational problem 
that no visitor, whatever his previous training or present occupation, can fail to find 
some point of contact. One sees not only school-teachers and students of education, 
but farmers, mechanics, merchants, and professional men studying them closely. 
Naturally the work of the new education, which aims to produce tangible results 
and to educate through a process of learning by doing, is far easier to represent than 
the older academic work. The average World’s Fair visitor passes by an exhibit of 
routine common school work, because it is not showy, and stops at exhibits of shop 
work, of decorative design, or of some other subject in which tangible results have 
been secured. He likes to find evidences that education prepares pupils for their 
life work, and enables them to reach a higher place in the industrial order than they 
could otherwise attain. He is likely, however, to judge exhibits of this character 
by an absolute standard, making finish and accuracy the tests, and ignoring the 
fundamental ideas of manual trainiag—that it is a discipline of the mind through 
the hand, and that the strength of the reflex influence, and not the value of material 
products, is really the measure of success. 
Another class of visitors, much smaller in number than the first, is attracted by 
something more than superficial excellence, Having a general knowledge of the 
work, they take an intelligent interest in it and are ready to examine all of the 
exhibits with some care, in order to keep abreast of educational progress. 
The third, and by far the most important, class of visitors to this section is com- 
posed of teachers and professional educators. Never before have the teachers in this 
country had such an opportunity to study a large and representative collection. 
Most of them have been so tied down to work in a narrow field that they do not 
i

    460 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
know what other schools are doing. They gather at the Fair a great deal of valu- 
able information which gives them new power to teach successfully. 
The educational section.is, however, but one of many interesting features of the 
Fair, and can claim only a small part of the time of the average visitor. It is, there- 
fore, necessary for persons interested in education to depend mainly on published 
reports for their knowledge of the section devoted to that subject. The great 
importance of educational work has led newspapers and magazines in all parts of 
the country to devote considerable space to descriptions of the exhibits; but most 
of the articles have merely described and have made no attempt to compare or inter- 
pret. It is, therefore, desirable that there should be a complete record of thé con- 
tents of the educational section, togetaer with a comparative study of its most 
important features. Fortunately the Exposition authorities have provided such a 
record and comparison by appointing competent experts from all parts of the world 
to judge the educational exhibits and award medals and prizes for the best. Their 
report will form a permanent record of the present condition of education, as far 
as it is shown by the Exposition, and should prove very suggestive and helpful to 
teachers everywhere. 
Since the work of describing individual exhibits and of recording the contents of 
the educational section, as a whole, will be so fully done by others, the writer of the 
present series of articles will not attempt to do either of these thoroughly, but will 
simply note a few of the salient features of educational work as shown by the 
exhibits. He will deai broadly with schools of every sort, from the kindergarten to 
the university, without attempting to enter into details or even touch. upon those 
parts of school work whose exhibits would require a minute expert examination. 
After discussing such general topics as classification and arrangement, methods of 
installation, and the kind of exhibits shown by different schools, he will describe a 
few typical exhibits from the fields of higher education, of public education, and of 
industrial, technical, and special education. 
The official classification of exhibits is very comprehensive and forms the basis on 
which awards will be made by the judges. It is well adapted to this purpose, but 
does not furnish a working plan that could be followed by school men in preparing 
exhibits. 
The Exposition authorities did not intend that it should be used in that way, but 
preferred that each exhibitor should be left free to prepare and arrange his exhibit 
in his own way, providing he should conform to a few general regulations. 
The result of this policy is a display that has many original features, and repre- 
sents admirably a great variety of schools, butlacks the one characteristic that would 
be most helpful to the student of education—a degree of uniformity. Each foreign 
nation, each of the United States, and each chartered or private institution forms an 
independent unit. One groups the exhibits according to subjects of study, another 
according to school grades, and a third on geographical lines. Some show the best 
work they have done during the current year, and others during a series of years. 
Some send a few papers from a large number of schools, and others a large number 
of papers from a few schools. Some aim to give a symmetrical view of the work 
actually done by pupils, others of the work that ought to be done by pupils; and 
still others make no attempt at symmetry, but show whatever will attract the eye, 
even if if has little or no educational significance. Some display regular school 
work, and others work prepared for the occasion. 
Even these confusing differences might not annoy the student seriously if he could 
recognize them on sight, but this he can not always do. He sees an exhibit that 
pleases him, and he wants to know what it represents; what is the age and sex of 
pupils and their previous preparation; the position of the subject in the complete 
course of study; the conditions under which the exhibit was prepared; the amount 
of assistance given by the teachers the degree to which the exhibit is typical of the 
average work of a large number of pupils, and so on. The answers tosome of these
-P-A-G-E-471
  AMERICAN VIEWS OF THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 461 
questions, especially those concerning age, sex, and grade of pupils, can usually be 
learned from the exhibit, but answers to others, which are quite as important in a 
comparative study, are almost impossible to obtain. 
It is, therefore, necessary to omit a great many attractive exhibits from this dis- 
cussion, simply because the schools from which they were sent have made no pro- 
vision for helping the student of education to interpret them. 
Viewed from the standpoint of organization, the educational exhibits may be 
grouped under five heads: 
(1) Individual exhibits. 
(2) Collective exhibits. 
(3) Institutional exhibits. 
(4) Commercial exhibits. 
(5) Active exhibits. 
An individual exhibit is one made by a single person or school, without reference 
to what is shown by others. It may be typical of an important class of schools, or 
it may be an isolated example of special education. 
A collective exhibit is one sent by a number of similar institutions, each of which 
sinks its individuality and unites with the others to form a collection of work typical 
of all, Nearly all the public school exhibits are collective. 
An institutional exhibit is one which represents a system established by recognized 
authority—usually a public school system. A very good example of this is the 
exhibit in the Illinois Building, which represents the educational work of all kinds 
maintained by public taxation in the State of Illinois. This, of course, excludes 
private schools and all chartered institutions not controlled by the State. 
A commercial exhibit is one made by a publisher of text-books or a manufacturer 
of educational supplies. His motive is, of course, to sell his goods, but he knows 
that the most effective way to do this is to arrange the exhibit so that its educa- 
tional value is apparent at a glance. One of the best examples of this group is the 
Prang exhibit, which contains a series of cards representing a model four years’ 
course in drawing, color, and form study. 
An active exhibit is a model school in actual operation. There are several at the 
Exposition which will be described in a subsequent article. 
On account of the infrequency of great expositions, the teachers of this country 
have seldom been called upon to exhibit their work on a large scale for the benefit of 
the generalpublic. Frequently educational exhibits are prepared for teachers’ gather- 
ings; but, as a rule, these represent only single schools or groups of schools, and are 
intended for the use of persons who are already somewhat familiar with the work 
represented. 
An international educational exposition requires a different préparation, aiming 
as it does to illustrate all departments of educational work in such a way that the 
ordinary visitor may study and compare them with ease. Among the great numbers 
of visitors, few are experts on any considerable part of the exhibit. 
The majority are people who, although interested in educational work, are not 
familiar with its practical details; who, in order to understand what the exhibit 
represents, need all the assistance that careful arrangement, plain labels, and well- 
informed custodians can supply. 
The result of this lack of familiarity with expositions is that many schools have 
not used the best methods in preparing and installing their exhibits. In fact, the 
greater part of the methods and devices used this year were invented by individual 
exhibitors to meet necessities as they arose, and were not available for adoption by 
others until after the Exposition opened. Someare very ingenious, and will undoubt- 
edly be retained as useful aids at subsequent expositions. 
A number of schools have succeeded in making their exhibits exceedingly attract- 
ive. They accomplish this in various ways. Some use their space as a room—car- 
pet the floor, line the walls with stuff that forms a pleasing background for pictures, 
 
-P-A-G-E-472
  462 z EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
and cover the whole with a ceiling of thin white cloth. They put in substantial oak 
furniture, tables, bookeases, chests of drawers, and comfortable chairs, and arrange 
the wall exhibits in such a way that they attract even the casual observer. Some 
schools add other artistic features. It may be a bust of the founder, a rehef model 
of the campus, ora collection of portraits of celebrated professors andalumni. This 
room arrangement is, however, exceptional. 
Nearly all of the exhibitors Civide their space into alcoves, cover the walls with 
drawings and specimens of school exercises, and place bound volumes of ‘pupils’ 
work on tables ranged along the wall. 
Among the show cases used there are many different kinds: glass-covered frames 
hung on the walls and filled with pictures or other flat exhibits; ordinary show 
cases supported by legs or by a case of drawers or a cupboard; and large upright 
glass cases, in which are suspended glass shelves to hold exhibits. There are, also, 
several varieties of wing frames. One consists of an iron upright supporting a num- 
ber of glass-covered wings that swing on hinges. This is rather heavy and clumsy 
and takes up a great deal of room. Modifications of this, fitted with only half the 
number of wings, are used against the wall. The kind of wing frame that seems 
best adapted to its purpose is that used for the New Jersey public school exhibits. 
It is an upright wooden case about 6 inches deep. In front is a glass-covered door, 
which is usually kept closed to protect the contents from dust. This door is 
arranged to hold afew specimens of the work with which the case is filled. Inside 
are a number of light, strong oak wings hung on separate hinges. Each can be 
detached easily, without disturbing the others. By a simple arrangement of grooves 
the exhibits, mounted on cardboards of uniform ‘size, slip in and out of the frames 
very easily. Such cases as these increase the amount of available wall space enor- 
mously, and at the same time keep the exhibits from being injured or destroyed. 
There are a great many different kinds:of exhibits displayed on the walls: pictures 
and photographs of exteriors and interiors of buildings, and of equipments, faculty, 
and students; specimens of students’ work, artistic, literary, scientific, and mechan- 
ical; statistical charts and tables; programmes of study and statements of the fea- 
tures of school work to which the attention of the public is specially directed. The 
methods of graphic statistics are used by many schools with great effect. 
One of the most unique features of the educational section is the phonograph 
exhibit. Five different States have sent wax cylinders stored with records of reci- 
tations, oral examinations, and exercises in singing. Attendants are always ‘ready 
to set the machines in motion and allow the visitors to hear a repetition of work 
that has actually been done in school. There is‘always a question whether or not it 
is work that fairly represents the school; but, in any event, it is very interesting, 
and when properly prepared is really valuable. 
In making.an examination of .all parts of the educational section, the student can 
not fail to be impressed with one important fact—that the work of the new educa- 
tion is finding its way into schools of every sort. ‘The laboratory method in science 
teaching is recognized as the most natural and logical means of educating the 
senses, and through them the mind. Hence the invreasing adoption of the sciences 
as important elements in school work is accompanied by an equally rapid develop- 
ment of laboratory facilities in schools. 
Manual training for boys and girls is growing in favor, and only the great‘expense 
of equipment prevents it from being introduced very generally. The work of adapt- 
ing it to every school grade, from the kindergarten to the institute of technology, is 
being carried forward rapidly, and the time will soon come when progressive school 
boards everywhere will make it a part of the prescribed course of study. x, 
Drawing and form study are also obtaining general recognition as necessary parts 
of a common school education, and object teaching is the order of the day. The 
latter is especially noticeable in the German school exhibit, where nearly every sub- 
ject has its models and charts.and colored illustrations, intended to teach the pupil 
through his senses.

AMERICAN VIEWS OF THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 463 
The importance attached to scientific methods has produced two results, both of 
which are shown clearly by the exhibits of higher education—an ability on the part 
of students to act as well as to think, and consequently an ability to pursue success- 
fully an original investigation. The exhibits of students’ work from agricultural and 
engineering schools are especially rich in illustrations of this point. 
‘There is also evidence that schools of every grade are paying a great deal of atten- 
tion to the sanitary condition of their buildings and to the physical development of 
pupils, and are coming to see that, to the pupil, a sound body is quite as important 
as a sound mind, 
An exhibit can give at best only a partial view of the work it is intended to repre- 
sent. Some of the schoolmen who recognize the fact do all that they can to help the 
student of education to interpret their exhibits properly. They arrange the whole 
in a progressive series clearly labeled to show the relations of its different’ parts; 
they insert explanations and teachers’ statements wherever necessary, to indicate 
the conditions under which exhibits were prepared; they provide catalogues and 
special publications for free distribution ;-they place in a prominent position a ques- 
tion box, into which anyone who is unable to find out all he wants to know about a 
certain school can drop his inquiries, and they provide for the constant attendance of 
a well-informed custodian. On the walls they place specimen exhibits; and, in ewp- 
boards, portfolios, and drawers, a large amount of additional material that is brought 
out whenever anyone is sufficiently interested to ask for it. They adopt the’ pre- 
vailing methods of object teaching, and illustrate their outlines of coursesiof study 
with photographs of schoolrooms, laboratories, and shops, students at work, and 
other scenes that will give reality and life to the exhibit. They aim to show only 
that which honestly represents the average work done by a considerable number ot 
pupils. 
Most of the men who make these careful and thorough preparations have gained 
their experience at other world’s fairs. When one contrasts their work with that of 
some of their fellow exhibitors who appear now for the first time, he can not but wish 
that America, like France, had a permanent exposition board whose duty it would 
be to organize all such displays, taking every advantage of previous experience. 
Il. The final product of education exists only in the mind, and can not be shown 
in a material exhibit. This is especially true of the results attained by higher edu- 
cation. They may be partially represented by such conerete products as books and 
models, and by illustrations of equipment, methods, and results, but these things 
are merely symbols, and mean little to the ordinary World’s Fair visitor. 
The question may arise in the mind of the reader: “ What has the ordinary vis- 
itor to do with an exhibit of higher education?” He should have a great deal to do 
with it, and he would, if it were prepared ina way that enabled him to understand 
its contents clearly. It is not enough to label each of the pieces and place them sido 
by side. There should be a dominant idea in the arrangement, a unity that could 
be perceived by any careful observer. There was scarcely an exhibit in the educa- 
tional section of the Columbian Exposition that showed any such careful prepara- 
tion, and therefore this article can be little more than a series of running comments 
on the exhibits from various higher institutions. 
Among them all the exhibit from the German universities was by far the most val- 
uable to the student of education. It showed in every part that it was intended to 
represent not any particular institution, but all of the twenty-one splendid centers 
of higher education in Germany. It was’prepared by the German Government with 
a-view to showing typical specimens of equipment and apparatus, the methods used, 
and the results achieved in German universities, and ‘also to show historically the influ- 
ence exerted by the universities on the progress of civilization. Both objects were 
successfully accomplished, but it was only the expert educationist who could fully 
understand the exhibit. It was not prepared for the general public, and no provi- 
sions were made for helping the casual visitor to appreciate its value. The labels
-P-A-G-E-474
  464 EDUCATION. REPORT, 1892-93. 
were brief and written in German, and the catalogues and descriptions which were 
distributed to persons who made special application were also in German. The uni- 
versity professors who were in charge were courteous and scholarly men, but in spite 
of their unwearied efforts they could accommodate only a small proportion of the 
people who wished to be helped to interpret the exhibit. It certainly needed inter- 
pretation, but once understood it became a wonderful source of information and 
inspiration to university men. The central feature was a “ collective exhibit of the 
German universities,” which contained 79 volumes written expressly for the Exposi- 
tion by the most eminent professors in Germany. Each of these men took for his 
subject his own department of study, and attempted to show, by an historical treat- 
ment, the influence exerted by that department on the development of German civil- 
ization. Wundtin psychology, Klein in mathematics, Virchow in pathology, and 
others of equal reputation produced the monographs which form this splendid rec- 
ord of the achievement of German university men. 
There was also a remarkable collection of pedagogical literature containing 
accounts of the origin and development of the German universities, their present 
constitution and government, biographies of their leading teachers, and a great deal 
of additional matter. It was from this collection of sources that the German pro- 
fessors drew a large part of their material for the monographs mentioned above. 
This library had three divisions: (1) General works, including bibliography, history, 
statistics, methods of university study in general and of the various departments of 
study in particular, and also student life and customs. (2) Biographies of the fore- 
most university teachers, arranged in four groups, including the men whose work 
was done (a) in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, (») in the seventeenth century, 
(c) in the eighteenth century, and (d) in the nineteenth century. Among the men 
whose biographies were given there were not only university teachers, but great 
scholars, statesmen, and ecclesiastics. (3) Literature of single universities, includ- 
- ing their history and their laws and regulations; announcements of teachers and 
courses; programmes of special occasions; information in regard to scholarships and 
endowments; and books written by great professors and by students whose work 
they directed. 
There were volumes of architectural drawings showing the plans and elevations of 
the buildings used by fifteen of the German universities, and photographic views of 
the interiors of these buildings. The beauty and value of this exhibit were greatly 
increased by the presence of about twenty-five oil paintings and statues of cele- 
brated German scholars and patrons of learning. 
In another section was a collection of scientific periodicals, including specimen 
volumes of the leading German publications and a bibliography of German period- 
ical literature. There was also a fine collection of scientific books, containing, it is 
true, only a small proportion of the whole number of scientific works written by 
German scholars, but nevertheless typical of the contributions they have made to 
nearly every department of human knowledge. 
The technical library exhibit represented with great completeness the several sys- 
tems in use for arranging and cataloguing books. It showed that while in methods 
and appliances the Germans are not as far advanced as the Americans, in the num- 
ber and value of their libraries they are far ahead of them. 
The exhibits already mentioned occupied less than half of the space devoted to 
the German universities. The remaining space contained special exhibits from 29 
different departments of study. Each of these was prepared by an eminent special- 
ist, and showed specimens of the apparatus used in teaching and typical examples 
of the problems attacked and the results attained in original research. 
From this brief sketch of the German university exhibit it may be seen that the 
power of the Government to prescribe a plan for united action was the most impor- 
tant element which insured its success. There is no such power in the hands of the 
Government of the United States, and consequently the exhibit from our own uni- 
 
-P-A-G-E-475
  
AMERICAN VIEWS OF THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 465 
versities, although much larger in quantity, was far less representative in character. 
Instead of being a collective exhibit designed to represent the universities as a 
whole, it was a series of individual exhibits, each arranged on a different plan. 
This was inevitable because of the diverse character of American institutions and 
the somewhat aggressive self-assertion which keepsthemapart. Instead of furnish- 
ing material to the student of education by showing methods, equipment, courses of 
study, and the results of research work, it aimed primarily to attract and interest 
the public. It was this very fault, however, that gave it a certain advantage over 
the German university exhibit by making it easier to interpret its contents. 
Before discussing in detail the American exhibits of higher education it may be 
well to take a brief glance at the institutions that were, or might have been, repre- 
sented. There are no two that afford an entirely satisfactory basis for comparison. 
Some do a considerable amount of true university work, but the greater number 
confine themselves mainly to offering undergraduate courses. Some have introduced 
the best scientific methods into every department of study, but many are still far 
behind the leaders in this respect. Some prescribe rigid entrance requirements and 
maintain a high standard of scholarship throughout, while others are little above 
the average city high school. There are, also, agricultural colleges and schools of 
technology, where the scientific and professional studies come first and culture 
courses are secondary. If these various types were distinct it might be possible to 
classify higher institutions, but they lap over one another in such a confusing way 
that any line dividing them into groups must be drawn arbitrarily. In discussing 
American exhibits, therefore, the contents of the exhibit rather than the nature of 
the institution will determine the grouping. 
There are several exhibits in which the methods and results of advanced research 
work were clearly shown. One of the most important of these was the collective 
exhibit drawn from a number of universities and representing: a typical laboratory 
for work in experimental psychology. Photographs of the interiors and equipment 
of the several institutions contributing hung on the walls, and the remainder of the 
room contained apparatus of all kinds for observing mental phenomena and accu- 
rately recording the results. Nearby was an anthropometric laboratory, in which 
were shown the methods and results of work done in observing and recording phys- 
ical characteristics. There were a large number of diagrams and charts, summariz- 
ing by graphic methods the results of a number of very interesting investigations. 
These two laboratories together revealed a most significant aspect of the work of 
American investigations—the tendency to make a thorough scientific study of the 
minds and bodies of pupils of all ages, in order to help each individual to learn in 
the way that nature intended he should. 
The exhibits from Clark University and from the University of the City of New 
York contained material of a similar character. Clark showed a number of photo- 
graphs of laboratories and apparatus for this work and bound volumes of monographs 
and magazines in which the results of psychological research were given. The Uni- 
versity of the City of New York showed charts illustrating experiments to determine 
mental characteristics, such as eye-mindedness, ear-mindedness, and the like. 
Among the other institutions showing methods and results of research work were 
Johns Hopkins, Harvard, the University of Chicago, the University of Pennsylvania, 
the University of Michigan, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the 
Hahnemann Medical College of Philadelphia. Johns Hopkins sent a large photo- 
graph of the normal spectrum, illustrating the splendid astronomical work done by 
her professors and her advanced students. She also sent a typical collection of the 
publications written or edited by Johns Hopkins men in order to show the character, 
direction, and extent of their investigations and the channels they use in putting 
their results before the world. Harvard also displayed a considerable amount of 
astronomical work from both of her observatories—the one in Cambridge and the 
one she maintains in the mountains of Peru. Each of her scientific departments

  466 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
and professional schools was represented by a typical piece of apparatus or a collec- 
tion of specimens or books intended to show her admirable facilities for teaching 
and the original work done by her professors and students. The latter included two 
collections of books showing some of tle contributions made by Harvard men to 
legal and historical literature. 
There were a number of exhibits showing the methods used in the university for 
instruction and training. These represented more especially the scientific and 
professional departments, and attracted a great deal of attention. 
One of the most valuable parts of the Harvard exhibit was that which showed 
the institution as a whole and furnished information in regard to its historical 
development and the present status of its faculties, buildings, and equipment. This 
exhibit included statistical charts showing the relative growth of the several depart- 
ments of study; charts illustrating the success achieved by the elective system which 
has been so thoroughly tried at Harvard; photographs and plans of buildings and 
grounds, and a fine collection of portraits and busts of men who have been closely 
identified with the university. There were also large editions of about thirty dif- 
ferent pamphlets for free distribution. These included the regular programmes and 
announcements and also a number of monographs relating to the opportunities 
offered by Harvard, the necessary expenses of student life, and the financial assistance 
that may be obtained, if needed, from the university authorities. 
The University of Pennsylvania sent a fine collection illustrating the results of 
the exploring expedition which she sent to Egypt and Assyria a few years ago; and 
also a collection of archeological material from the valley of the Delaware, where 
her professors have at various times conducted valuable investigations, She also 
showed a number of photographs and charts illustrating the growth of her different 
departments and their present condition. 
The buildings of the University of Chicago were so close to the Exposition that 
they were visited by a great many people interested in education. There was there- 
fore no attempt to send to the Fair a comprehensive showing of the work done by 
each department of study. The most important exhibit from that university was 
the Yerkes telescope. It represented not work already done, but facilities offered for 
future research work, and may be regarded as typical of the purpose for which pri- 
marily the university was established—original investigation by advanced students. 
The University of Michigan sent two collections representing original work done 
in her chemical laboratories. One contained the results of a quantitative analysis 
of a number of foods, including wheat, bread, Indian corn, tea, and coffee. In each 
case the constituents were prepared from their proper sources, and the entire 
group—i. e., a given weight of the food and the corresponding quantities of its 
several constituents—was placed in glass jars and clearly labeled. The other co!l- 
lection represented a similar investigation in the department of metallurgical chem- 
istry. Iron ore, cast iron, blast furnace slag, steel, wrought iron, coal, limestone, 
and brass were all opened up in this way. These two exhibits were good illustra- 
tions of the way in which the results of scientific investigation may help in solving 
everyday problems of industrial and domestic life. 
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology sent two important collections illus- 
trating the original work done by her students and professors. The first was a 
complete.set of the theses written by the class of 1892 when they. were graduated. 
There were 128 men and 4 women in the class, and each of them presented before 
graduation the results of a distinctly original investigation conducted either alone 
or in conjunction with one other member of the class. In every instance the draw- 
ings or other illustrations made as a part of the thesis were shown in the exhibit. 
The second collection was a complete set of the lecture notes prepared by institute 
professors for the use of their own students. In some cases these notes have been 
expanded and published in book form through the customary channels. Usually, 
however, the notes are specially prepared for each class, and instead of being pub-
-P-A-G-E-477
  AMERICAN VIEWS OF THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 467 
lished are privately printed in small quantities. This is done in nearly every 
department of the institute and furnishes a striking illustration of the purely 
inductive method used by its professors, and of their untiring efforts to give to their 
students the latest results of scientific thought and investigation. 
The Hahnemann Medical College of Philadelphia made a very unique contribution 
to the educational section. It was the nervous system of a man, carefully dissected 
out by a skillful surgeon. This was mounted, so as to show general outlines, with 
the brain oceupying the position of the head, the spinal cord, the position of the 
backbone, and the nerve bundles and nerve fibers, the positions of the body and 
limbs. It enabled the visitor to get a definite idea of the way in which the fibers 
of the nervous system, starting from the brain and the spinal cord, penetrate every 
part of the human body. 
There were a number of exhibits designed to show something of the methods, 
equipment, and results of regular college work. The list included most of the aboye- 
mentioned institutions, and also ten or twelve endowed colleges and almost an equal 
number of State universities. Some of these exhibits were so meager that they 
deserved little attention, while others were of great interest and value. It was 
noticeable, however, that even among the exhibits sent by the more prominent col- 
leges there was great diversity. Some aimed to show their history, others their 
equipment, and still others the work done by former students and professors. Most 
of them seemed to regard a showing of present work—the courses of study, the 
methods used, and the results achieved—as a minor part of an educational exhibit. 
Princeton emphasized her history. She sent portraits of all her former presidents, 
pictures, a relief model of her buildings and grounds, and a collection of interesting 
documents and relies connected with her development. There was also a large col- 
lection of books, which included, as far as possible, all of the important literary 
productions of the faculty and alumni. Student life was represented by photo- 
graphs of famous athletic teams and other organizations, and by pictures of the 
various college societies and the houses they occupy. A few models and drawings 
and a case of museum material for teaching historic ornament were the only dis- 
tinctly educational exhibits. 
Yale showed a series of large photographs giving general views of buildings and 
grounds, interiors of laboratories, recitation halls, libraries, and museums; appa- 
ratus that is either very elaborate or especially characteristic of Yale work; and 
athletic teams that have won high laurels for their alma mater. The photographs 
were so fine that they really gave to the visitor a good idea of the material equip- 
ment of the university. But there was shown no work of students or professors, 
nothing to represent the splendid contributions made by Yale to literature and 
science. Columbia College was represented by a fine series of statistical tables and 
graphic charts showing the important features of her history and her present con- 
dition. One very interesting part of the exhibit consisted of two maps placed side 
by side, one representing the present site of the college and the other the new cam- 
pus on Morningside Heights. The maps were drawn to the same scale and showed 
in a very effective way the great increase of area that will be afforded by the new 
site. - 
Brown, Amherst, Williams, Colgate, Hamilton, Rochester, Lehigh, Oberlin, Beloit, 
and Leland Stanford Junior, should be mentioned at least in the list of colleges 
represented. Most of them had attractive and tastefully arranged alcoves, but 
their exhibits showed no important features not already mentioned in connection 
with other institutions. 
Among the women’s colleges Vassar, Wellesley, Bryn Mawr, and many coeduca- 
tional institutions were represented. Bryn Mawr had in the center of her exhibit 
a model of the campus, showing the location of halls, dormitories, the gymnasium, 
and several tennis courts. On the walls were photographs giving characteristic 
views of interiors, a chart showing courses of study; and statistical tables giving 
   
-P-A-G-E-478
  468 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
the post-graduate history of all of her alumne. There were also several Ph. D. 
theses and partial files of student publications. 
It may be of interest to mention here the exhibit made by the Association of Col- 
legiate Alumnx. This body of highly educated women is growing rapidly in num- 
bers and exerts a very strong influence in many parts of the country. Its members 
aim to make the best possible use of their college training in helping to solve social 
and industrial problems. In the exhibit were a number of pamphlets containing 
addresses delivered before the several branches of the association. One, which may 
be taken as typical, was written by a professor of chemistry of one of the leading 
institutions of the East. Her subject was: ‘The relation of college women to 
progress in domestic economy.” The writer indicated some of the ways in which a 
scientific training may be of use in the family and discussed the social and economic 
aspects of the servant question, the assistance that a knowledge of biology offers 
to the buyer of foods, and the relation of chemistry to cooking. She presented evi- 
dence of the growing tendency to make the higher education of women “ tell,” and 
to direct their effort into channels which will lead them to become better house- 
keepers and more effective workers in fields peculiarly their own. 
The State university exhibits in every instance adjoined the public school exhibits. 
Only two States, Illinois and Michigan, made any serious effort to show the work of 
their respective universities. The other States represented were Pennsylvania, 
Indiana, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oregon, and California. Several of them 
showed only a few pictures of buildings and equipment and photographs of pro- 
fessors and students; others added outlines of courses, examples of student work, 
and perhaps copies of their student publications, One or two sent catalogues for 
distribution, but as a rule they showed very little to indicate the true nature of 
their work, 
The exhibit from the University of Michigan may be divided, for convenience in 
discussion, into (a) general exhibits, (b) departmental exhibits, and (c) engineering 
exhibits. The general exhibits are described in the University Record for June as 
follows: 
“The exhibit includes topographical maps of the campus, made from actual sur- 
veys by civil engineering students, on which all buildings and natural objects are 
accurately located; a tolerably complete set of views of all of the buildings, with 
floor plans of many of them, together with interior views of all laboratories, hos- 
pitals, many recitation rooms, and the library; a condensed account of the educa- 
tional system of Michigan and a summary of the University Calendar, together with 
photographs of the president, the regents, and other officers, including members of 
the several faculties, all mounted and displayed on a revolving chart stand; a brief 
history of the university and of its several departments, together with a summary 
description of their present condition exhibited by a series of 19 charts, 24 by 30 
inches in size, framed and mounted so as to swing about a central upright; and 
a bookease containing copies of nearly all the publications of professors written 
while connected with the university.” 
The list of departments sending exhibits included chemistry, medicine and surg- 
ery, dental surgery, the library, and the museum. A part of the chemistry exhibit 
has been described above. It was supplemented by other collections of work done by 
students, both in the laboratory and the class room, and was intended to illustrate 
methods of teaching. 
The exhibits of medicine and surgery contained an admirable presentation of the 
equipment, the methods, and the courses of instruction in those departments. They 
included a very complete series of photographs carefully interpreted by means of 
printed statements, and also a number of preparations such as all students in these 
departments are required to make, 
The museum was represented by some rare zoological specimens from the Philip- 
pine Islands and a collection of the birds and mammals of the State of Michigan.    
 
-P-A-G-E-479
       AMERICAN VIEWS OF THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 469 
    The engineering exhibit was a very complete showing of the work done by students 
in the engineering laboratories and in the several courses in drawing and design. 
It included a number of hand tools and other small pieces made in the wood shop, 
the forge room, and the machine shop, and several larger tools, such as a forge, a 
drill press, and a machine lathe, all of them built by students. The exhibit of 
drawings contained examples of the free-hand exercises and the work in geometrical 
construction and descriptive geometry, and also of the working and finished drawings 
made in the more advanced courses in machine design, stereotomy, and surveying. 7 
The exhibit from the University of Illinois was not in the Liberal Arts Gallery, 
but in the Illinois State Building. It occupied a large amount of space and could 
display, therefore, not only students’ work and pictures of equipment, but students 
at work and specimen pieces of the equipment itself, taken directly from the muse- 
ums, shops, and laboratories of the university. This gave if a marked advantage 
over the other higher institutions. 
In the general university exhibit was an alcove containing pictures of the faculty 
and of the buildings, catalogues for free distribution, and a number of diagrams 
and graphic charts showing the courses of study and the recent attendance in each 
department. y 
In the departmental exhibit the colleges of agriculture, engineering, science, and 
literature were all represented. The engineering and science exhibits were, how- 
ever, the most prominent. The general plan was to give one or more alcoves to each 
department and there show equipment and students’ work. In some there were 
specimen pages of student exercises framed and hung on the wall, and the corre- 
sponding work of the entire class bound in a single volume and placed near by on 
bookshelves. In other departments (physics, for example) there were shown in 
glass cases series of typical experiments, with the apparatus properly arranged and 
beside it a student’s notebook open to the page on which the results of the experi- 
ment were recorded. In the alcoves for architecture there were groups of drawings, 
to show the amount of work done in each year of the course and some typical exam- 
ples of original work in house planning and design. Oue of the special features 
made possible by the large amount of space given to this exhibit was a machine 
shop, in which students from the university worked several hours each day. It was 
separated from the rest of the exhibit only by a low railing and contained a milling 
machine, a machine lathe, a speed lathe, and a dynamo—all of them driven by an 
electric motor. This shop furnished a valuable illustration of the thoroughly 
practical training that is given to professional students in the best engineering 
schools. . 
The most comprehensive and symmetrical exhibit of engineering education was 
that contributed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It contained a 
number of large photographs showing exteriors and interiors of the buildings and 
a complete set of architectural plans and illustrations of the efficient system by 
which the newer buildings are heated and ventilated. Organization was shown in 
a bound volume containing specimen pages of publications and announcements and 
copies of all of the blank forms used by the officers of administration. 
The work of the several departments was displayed in a very thorough fashion in 
separate alcoves. Each alcove contained on the walls specimen drawings and 
designs and on a central table a large portfolio of matter specially prepared to show 
the plan of work. This portfolio gave, as far as possible, a complete picture of the 
course—the list of instructions, the subjects studied arranged in order of sequence 
and showing how much time is devoted to each; the methods of instructors, de- 
scribed in printed statements prepared by the head of the department; the equip- 
ment, shown by numerous photographs, each of which was described in detail; and 
specimen pages of the notes prepared by professors and those taken by students. 
In the center of the exhibit were cases of shop exercises in carpentry, forging, 
pattern making, ete., each piece carefully labeled and the whole arranged in a pro-

  gressive series. A special catalogue accompanied this part of the exhibit, and a cir- 
cular was given out describing its main characteristics and its relation to the work 
of the other departments of the institute. 
There were several large exhibits of shop and laboratory products, an electric 
motor, a force pump, and a case of chemicals prepared by students for their own 
use. Student life was shown in a portfolio which contained photographs of athletic 
teams, and of musical, literary, and social organizations; specimen pages of student 
publications; and a printed account of all the prominent and social features of insti- 
tute life. The collection, as a whole, represented the institute so well that it is said 
that if the entire institution were to be swept away it could be reconstructed from 
the information contained in the exhibit. 
One of the most interesting exhibits of higher education was on the batile ship 
Illinois, and represented the work done at the Annapolis Naval Academy. It con- 
sisted chiefly of text-books, examination papers, and records from each department 
of study and cases of shopwork done by the cadets. Besides the usual exercises 
from the drawing-room, forge room, wood shop, and machine shop, there were others 
peculiar to Annapolis, such as specimens of work done in splicing cables, braiding 
ropes, and placing pulley blocks, designs for marine engines and boilers, and illus- 
trations of problems in seamanship and gunnery. There were a number of charts 
showing results of the physical tests conducted at frequent intervals, and also a 
number of student possessions—foils, boxing gloves, and footballs—that were very 
suggestive of the cadets’ fondness for athletic sports. 
The exhibit from Purdue University was, in some respects, one of the best in the 
American section. It represented very effectively the objective work done—the shop- 
work, drawing, and laboratory tests. ‘‘The making of a lathe” was shown in a way 
that gave the visitor a clear notion of the entire process of designing and construct- 
ing machines. First came a set of blue prints and working drawings showing the 
form and dimensions of each piece of the lathe, and a set of finished drawings show- 
ing the grouping of the parts. Then came a complete set of the patterns from which 
the lathe was cast; then the rough castings made from these patterns; then the fin- 
ished castings, and finally the completed lathe. The same idea of logical deyvelop- 
ment was used in other parts of the shop exhibit. The process of casting was illus- 
trated. by a series of ten or twelve molders’ flasks, the first empty, the second half 
filled with sand, and the others showing the successive steps taken in making the mold, 
drawing the pattern, cutting the gate, pouring the metal, and taking out the cast- 
ing. The exhibit of forging was equally clear. A pair of tongs, for example, was 
shown first in the form of stock, then prepared for welding, and then ready for use. 
The most unique feature of this exhibit, however, was a small working model of 
the locomotive which is a part of the Purdue laboratory equipment, and is used in 
making shop tests that are said to be as accurate as road tests. The load is obtained 
by applying hydraulic pressure to the wheels and the influence of grade by adjusting 
the driving wheels at their points of contact with the free wheels on which they rest. 
The exhibit of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute was entirely different from 
that of any other engineering school. It contained, it is true, a small aniount of 
students’ work, i. e., several portfolios of geometrical and machine drawings and 
exercises in graphics and surveying, but the main part of the exhibit was designed 
to show, not undergraduate study, but the work done in after life by graduates. 
There were pictures of bridges, railroads, aqueducts, and many other engineering 
works constructed wholly or in part by graduates; and several machines showing 
inventions made by them. Although very interesting, these things can not be 
regarded as legitimate parts of an educational exhibit, because the mature work of 
an engineer is influenced by many factors besides the training received during the 
early years spent in professional study. 
The collective exhibit of agricultural colleges and experiment stations was one of 
the most important and suggestive parts of the entire Exposition. It represented
-P-A-G-E-481
      AMERICAN VIEWS OF THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. AT         about sixty institutions which offer to both men and women “instruction in agri- 
culture, the mechanic arts, and various branches of physical, natural, and economic 
science with special reference to their application in the industries of life and to the 
facilities for such instruction.” It contained illustrations of equipment and methods 
of instruction and specimens of students’ work, which showed that both the colleges 
and the stations are exerting a most important influence; the colleges by giving 
students a sound training in the methods of science and their practical application, 
the experiment stations by making an united effort ‘to create positive knowledge 
toward the development of an agricultural science.” The illustrations of equipment 
included a considerable amount of material used in teaching how farms should be 
laid out and drained, buildings arranged, soils improved, crops planted, tended, and 
harvested, and stock cared for at allseasons. Under “method of instruction” it was 
shown that the laboratory method is used wherever practicable, and that the list of 
laboratories includes not only the usual rooms for experimental science and shop- 
work, but also fields, stables, orchards, and gardens. The student work was, as 
might be expected, of a very practical character—shopwork of all sorts, scientific 
preparations, samples of crops, and products of the dairy, as well as needlework, 
cookery, and preserved foods. 
There was evidence of a most earnest effort on the part of these institutions to 
work together, each making its course as broad as possible by forming an alliance 
with a college which offers instruction in the liberal arts; each paying special atten- 
tion to local conditions in order to make its influence felt in its immediate neighbor- 
hood; and each recognizing in its research work the principle of division of labor and 
attacking certain definite parts of the whole great problem. 
The moyement for university extension was represented by exhibits from Oxford, 
the University of Chicago, the University of the City of New York, and several 
smaller colleges. Oxford sent a case containing photographs of the exterior and 
interior of the building she has devoted to this work, examples of the publications 
issued and the blank forms used, a specimen traveling library containing 31 volumes, 
and a considerable amount of statistical and other information in regard to the his- 
tory of the movement in England. 
The University of the City of New York and the University of Chicago showed 
on wing frames sets of administrative blanks and specimens of the announcements 
and other publications issued in connection with extension work in both places. 
There were also several traveling libraries illustrating the methods used in furnish- 
ing to each lecturer a moderate number of the best reference books bearing on his 
subject, and sending them with him wherever he goes, so as to furnish his students 
with a small working library. 
The Chautauqua exhibit may be mentioned in this connection, not because the 
Chautauqua system resembles university extension in its specific aims and methods, 
for it does not, but because it, too, is a movement for popularizing higher education 
and fostering a taste for the various lines of study. The alcove devoted to this 
exhibit contained a very systematic showing of the work done in the Chautauqua 
literary and scientific circles, and also in Chautauqua College. Programmes and leaf- 
lets explaining the work were freely distributed, and a great many visitors were led 
to recognize for the first time that ‘‘Chautauqua” stands for two very distinet things: 
(1) Literary and scientific work done at home during the year by people who wish 
to be guided in their reading and study, and (2) thorough college work in all branches 
done at Chautauqua, under competent university instractors, during six weeks of 
the summer vacation. 
For obvious reasons the greater part of this article has been devoted to a compari- 
son of American educational exhibits. This was not because the foreign universities 
sent nothing, for Germany, France, Russia, Canada, Japan, and the South American 
Republics were all represented, but rather because of the greater importance to us 
of astudy of education athome. We could derive great profit from a knowledge of

  foreign schools and foreign institutions, but after all, it is the American problem 
which confronts us, and the American solution that should receive our closest study. 
III. The public school exhibits at the Columbian Exposition proved to be of great 
value to the student of education. This was not because they presented a complete 
picture of the best systems of public education the world over, for they did not; 
nor was it because they fairly represented the work done in the schools of any single 
country, for this was not true even of the United States. The great valne of the 
exhibits was due to the fact that in spite of their fragmentary character and (in 
many cases) hasty preparation, they embodied ideas and ideals of popular education 
that could not fail to be helpful and inspiring to every thoughtful visitor. They 
afforded teachers an opportunity to compare the plans, methods, and results of the 
school work of many different nations and to see how widespread is the present inter- 
est in certain great educational movements. Recognition of the value of nature- 
study, the use of objective methods, the incorporation of kindergarten and manual 
training schools into systems of public education, these and many other important 
features of educational progress were illustrated, not only by exhibits from the 
United States, but also by school work sent from such widely separated countries as 
Japan, Canada, Russia, and the Argentine Republic. Visitors found, also, that both 
at home and abrcad increasing attention is being paid to the training of teachers 
and the building up of a science of education, and that from distant Montevideo to 
Tokyo on the one side, and St. Petersburg on the other, there are growing up educa- 
tioval museums which are important factors in the development of national systems 
of education. American teachers were newly aroused to a recognition of the many 
ways in which a well-equipped museum would help them in their work, and they 
Irequently expressed a hope that America would not neglect this great opportunity 
to secure the most important World’s Fair collections and found such a museum. 
They will be interested to learn that this plan has been carried out, and that the city 
of Philadelphia has secured some of these collections, and intends to provide for the 
establishment and maintenance of a great educational museum. 
During the Fair the foreign collections were of little use to students of education, 
since many of them were placed in out-of-the-way corners, and some were not even 
unpacked because of the limited amount of space assigned for educational exhibits. 
It was deplorable that the men who conceived and carried out the plans for the Fair 
on such a magnificient scale should fail to recognize the importance of providing 
properly for the educational section. It should have been assigned the choicest spot 
in all the Fair. A recent writer has said: ‘‘The progress of man toward higher civ- 
ilization results from a combination of two important movements: First, that which 
aims at the acquisition and diffusion of knowledge; and second, that which seeks to 
apply this knowledge in the arts.” The World’s Fair officials spent millions of 
dollars in representing the historical development and the present condition of the 
arts; but they waited until the Fair was almost ready to be opened before giving 
formal recognition to the institutions which make it possible to maintain these same 
arts in their present state and to develop them still further. 
The space when assigned, although far too small for the purpose for which it was 
intended, was larger than had been given to education at any previous world’s fair. 
The greater part of it was devoted to exhibits of public education, and contained a 
wealth of material for studying important public school questions, such as central- 
ized authority v. local self-government; trained teachers v. untrained; individual 
freedom for teacher and pupil v. rigid restriction of such freedom; the use of text- 
books v. the study of nature; and purely intellectual discipline v. the simultaneous 
training of head, heart, and hand. The foreign exhibits contained much valuable 
material for study along all of these lines, but the writer will use them in this 
article merely as illustrations of points made in discussing the United States 
exhibits. 
     
 
-P-A-G-E-483
  AMERICAN VIEWS OF THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 473 
There were two ways in which the visitor could geta broad view of public educa- 
tion in the United States: First, by studying the exhibit sent from Washington by 
the Bureau of Education; and second, by studying the exhibits of organization and 
administration in the several State sections. The exhibit of the Bureau of Educa- 
tion was intended to show what attitude the National Government assumes toward 
schools and colleges in this country, viz, one of encouragement and moral support 
to every educational institution, and of direct assistance to three important classes 
of schools: (1) The public schools in each new State; (2) agricultural colleges (of 
which there is at least one in every State in the Union); and (3) the schools of 
Alaska. The Bureau also cooperates with schoolmen, as far as its funds permit, in 
translating foreign publications and in collecting and publishing information of any 
sort that will help the cause of education. 
The Government exhibit, therefore, consisted largely of the publications of the 
Bureau, including books, charts, maps, and statistics; books collected by the Bureau, 
such as catalogues of the colleges and universities of the world; catalogues of sec- 
ondary schools, copies of educational journals, and reports of State and local school 
superintendents. There was also an interesting showing of Alaskan school work 
and the collective exhibit of agricultural colleges which was mentioned in a pre- 
vious article. 
It was necessary, however, to examine the State exhibits in order to study the 
actual conditions under which public school work in different parts of the country 
is carried on. The diversity found in the exhibits of school laws and organization 
showed at once how entirely independent each State is in controlling these matters. 
In some States, e. g., Indiana, the authority is centralized, while in others, notably 
Massachusetts, the principle of local self-government prevails. In studying the 
educational exhibits this fact had to be kept in mind constantly in order to estimate 
properly the importance of small collective exhibits as compared with large indi- 
vidual exhibits. 
Nearly every State exhibiting made some attempt to show school resources and 
organization, but only four or five did this with marked success. Massachusetts, 
New York, and Michigan were among the foremost, sending maps, charts, and 
printed documents, and using a great variety of graphic and tabular methods to 
illustrate important features of their respective State systems. 
New York sent a large wall map, on which were indicated not only the location of 
every educational institution in the State, but also the character of each, whether 
public or private; if sectarian, whether Protestant or Catholic, how supported, and 
whether it admits men only, or women only, or both. This map was a masterpiece 
in graphic representation, and attracted a great deal of attention. 
Michigan sent a smaller wall map, answering many of the same questions by a 
similar system of arbitrary signs, and added a series of county maps that were 
placed on wing frames at the level of the eye, and could contain, therefore, a far 
larger number of details than if hung on the wall. By the side of each map was a 
column of statistics in regard to the schools shown upon it, giving school population 
and attendance; the number of teachers (male and female), and the average salaries 
of each; the number of schoolhouses and their capacity; the cost of maintaining 
the public schools, and statements in regard to the taxes assessed for their support. 
These maps were supplemented by graphic charts on which the important totals of 
the public school statistics of the State were separately shown, and by a series of 
photographs of the buildings, the teachers, and the pupils of representative schools 
throughout its State. Each photograph was accompanied by a concise statement in 
regard to the course of study, the cost of maintenance, and the number of teachers 
and pupils in the school shown. To represent the administration of all of these 
schools there were collected in a single volume typical sets of the administrative 
blanks used by the central authorities and by many of the best schools in the State.   
-P-A-G-E-484
    474 a. “EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
This splendid showing of organization and administration, together with the 
exhibit of pupils’ work, gave a good picture of public education in Michigan from 
the kindergarten to the university. The visitor could study the State system as a 
system, and see where the schools are, of what materials they are built, how well 
attended, what the pupils look like, what they study, what preparation the teachers 
have had, what salaries they receive, how school funds are raised and finances man- 
aged, and how school supervision and other details of organization are controlled. 
Michigan is not mentioned thus prominently because the separate parts of its exhibit 
were necessarily better than the corresponding parts of other exhibits. On the 
contrary, the coilection of pupils’ work, for example, was very inadequate to repre- 
sent the schools of the State or even of its larger cities. It is mentioned because, in 
showing its system as such, it combined nearly all of the good features to be found 
jn the State exhibits. 
California sent relief maps to show the distribution of her rural schools, and South 
Dakota sent maps showing the location of school lands. A number of States con- 
tributed fine statistical charts, and several sent collections of reports and school 
laws. New York made a very comprehensive ‘showing of the work of the board of 
regents, including in it many reports and bound volumes and some valuable graphic 
charts. 
Only a few States sent maps to show the location of every public school building, 
but nearly all sent numerous illustrations of school architecture. These included 
photographs of the exteriors of public school buildings, plans and elevations of typical 
city and country schools; descriptions of the methods used in heating, lighting, and 
ventilating schoolhouses, and photographs of interiors showing the general appear- 
ance of recitation rooms and laboratories in use, their furniture and fittings, and, in 
many instances, the pupils themselves, either busy at work or else grouped in the 
foreground. It was noticeable that many of the Western cities had especially hand- 
some schoolhouses, and that in all parts of the country the schools recently built 
showed a marked advance over their predecessors, both in architectural beauty and 
in fitness for school work. 
The fine collection ef photographs sent by the Bureau of Education to represent 
library architecture should also be mentioned here. It contained numerous plans 
and elevations and about two hundred photographs of large library buildings in all 
parts of the country, and it was studied with great care by visitors. In many parts 
of the educational section there were supplementary exhibits—reports, bibliogra- 
phies, and statistical tables—giving further information about libraries. It was very 
interesting to study the American library exhibits in connection with those sent by 
the German and other foreign Governments, in order to see how our country compares 
with the other leading countries of the world in providing for this great department 
of public education. 
School architecture and equipment were also represented by a number of model 
schoolrooms fitted up for the use of the several active exhibits. These were located 
in various parts of the grounds, and, although only one or two were designed to rep- 
resent public school work, all of them will be noted here for the reason that a model 
room ought to show the best equipment for every school of the grade represented, 
whether public or private. 
There were two of these rooms in the Illinois Building. One-was fitted up under 
the direction of the State superintendent of public instruction, and contained a 
representative collection of school furniture for teachers and pupils, and also a con- 
siderable amount of apparatus for instruction, maps, pictures, and diagrammatic 
charts, collections and apparatus for science work and kindergarten teaching, and 
a few text-books. 
The other was a light airy room, in which, under the auspices of the Illinois board 
of lady managers, a kindergarten was in daily session. It had large windows on 
the south and east sides, the walls were prettily tinted and decorated, the window

  AMERICAN VIEWS OF THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 475 
seats were filled with flowers, and there was the usual kindergarten furniture. It 
showed not an elaborate ideal, but simply an attractive, cheerful schoolroom, such 
as ought to be provided, if possible, for every kindergarten. 
In the Children’s Building there were several model rooms; a creche in which the 
babies were cared for by nurses and the “toddlers” were amused with toys and 
games; a kitchen garden containing the appliances needed in teaching elementary 
housewifery; a gymnasium provided with simple apparatus for body building; a 
deaf and dumb school which had no especially unique school furniture, and a sloid 
workshop. The latter was equipped with the benches and tools needed in construct- 
ing the entire series of models that are made in the sloid school in Boston, and it 
attracted a great deal of attention and favorable comment. 
The Indian school building in the southern part of the grounds was not intended 
to be typical of what a school of this kind should be. It was necessarily small, and 
without the machinery and other appliances needed in teaching the more important. 
industrial branches, and yet it illustrated very well the problems that must be met 
in these schools; and by means of well-arranged rooms for work and for recitation, 
and also by photographs and transparencies showing the buildings of several Indian 
schools, it gave to the visitor a tolerably good idea of how such institutions are 
equipped. 
There were in various parts of the educational section interesting exhibits of 
school furniture. The Bureau of Edueation showed models illustrating the histori- 
cal development of American invention along this line; several manufacturers sent 
specimens of the furniture now on the market; and a number of foreign countries— 
notably Uruguay and Japan—showed models of school furniture and fittings. 
Appliances and apparatus for instruction did not occupy a very large part of the 
space devoted to school exhibits. This was largely due to the fact that the objective 
methods now so generally recognized as an indispensable feature of every scheme of 
education make it possible to use so many things as ‘apparatus for instruction” 
that not merely the contents of a single section but nearly everything in the Fair 
might be classed under this head by one or another kind of school. There were, 
however, several exhibits designed especially to show the apparatus used for teach- 
ing the principles of science in secondary schools. One represented the amount of 
apparatus that.a school must haye in order to secure a special appropriation from 
the University of the State of New York, and near it was a fuller collection intended 
to show what additional appliances these schools are expected to obtain as soon as 
their funds permit. 
There were several collections of sae made by students in schools for the 
training of teachers. Tho most important of these was from the Teachers’ College 
in New York, and consisted of one hundred specimens of simple apparatus for instruc- 
tion in physics, chemistry, and physiology. The construction and use of each piece 
were explained by means of diagrams and printed statements. This collection was 
carefully studied by a great many teachers, who regarded it as one of the most help- 
ful parts of the entire educational exhibit. Several normal schools sent smaller col- 
lections of a similar nature, and some added simple apparatus for teaching geology, 
botany, and other subjects. 
Normal schools did not on the whole make very extensive exhibits, as they seemed. 
to feel that their work was hard to represent. It is true that the training of teach- 
ers is a process of developing an inner power that does not find immediate outward 
expression, and that many of the methods used can be illustrated only in an active 
exhibit. There are, nevertheless, important parts of normal school work that can be 
shown. é 
A number of State normal schools sent collections of photographs and bound vol- 
umes of written work, but usually not enough to enable visitors to study the methods 
they use or the results they have achieved. A few exhibits, notably those from New 
Jersey, New York, and Massachusetts, were more satisfactory in this respect, and the
-P-A-G-E-486
    476 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Illinois exhibit contained a most valuable normal school section. The latter was 
in two parts, the State schools being shown in the Illinois Building, and the Cook 
County school in the Children’s Building. The large amount of space available 
gave the normal schools of Illinois a great advantage over those of other States, and 
they used it well. They devoted a part of the wall space to showing, by means of a 
series of charts, the courses of study they offer, and the interrelations of these courses. 
Below were volumes of written papers representing work done by pupils in each sub- 
ject of study, and also herbaria and other scientific collections made by students. 
Equipment was represented by means of photographs, and the work of model schools 
was shown in its relation to normal school training. Methods for nature study 
and various kinds of illustrative work were prominent in each of the three exhibits, 
especially in that of the Cook County school. 
The exhibits above noted were very essential features of the public school section, 
but of course the greater part of the space was filled with pupils’ work, the walls 
being covered chiefly with the results of drawing and form study and the shelves 
with volumes of written work, while the cases contained mechanical and scientific 
products. It was necessary, for the interpretation of this great mass of material, 
that each exercise shown should be accompanied by a statement of the course of 
study to which it belonged, the previous preparation of the student who produced 
jt, and the conditions under which he worked on this particular occasion. In most 
of the exhibits these teachers’ statements were wholly lacking, and in only a few 
were they at all satisfactory. 
Many of the State exhibits were so fragmentary that it was impossible to arrange 
them in a way that would give a good idea of the system as a whole. Those which 
were more complete did not adopt a common plan of arrangement, and the result 
was very confusing. A few of the States made up for this defect by providing 
expert custodians to assist visitors who wanted to study school work, but where 
there was no regular attendant it interfered seriously with the usefulness of the 
exhibit. 
Illinois and Washington had plenty of room in their State buildings, and were 
able therefore to carry out the original “gridiron” plan, viz, to arrange school ma- 
terial so that by going through the exhibit in one direction visitors could follow a 
single subject through successive grades, and by going through at right angles to 
this direction they could study the work done in every subject taught in a single 
grade. The material in the Illinois exhibit was grouped under the heads of (a) 
rural schools, (b) graded schools, (c) high schools, and (d) manual training schools. 
The intention was to make an institutional exhibit, i. e., a collective exhibit of the 
entire public school system of the State rather than an aggregation of individual 
exhibits from various schools in the State. This proved to be impracticable, because 
the State has not a uniform system, and there is so much difference between schools 
of the same grade in different places that no collective exhibit could represent them 
fairly. 
One of the most interesting portions of the Illinois exhibit was sent by the 
Chicago schools. The greater part of it was displayed on wing frames, of which 
each was devoted to a single subject of study, and had its contents arranged grado 
by grade in a progressive series. There were also bound volumes of written work 
and a number of drawings, and the whole afforded an excellent opportunity to learn 
something of what the Chicago schools are doing. 
The exhibit of science teaching from the high schools of Chicago was especially 
well arranged. It included work in physics, chemistry, and biology, and bore 
evidence of being genuine, i. e., pupils’ work prepared in the class room or in the 
laboratory, as a part of the regular course of instruction. The writer does not 
mean to imply that this work was exceptional in being genuine, but only that it 
was exceptional in bearing on its face such clear evidence that it was genuine. It 
included pictures and descriptions of experiments, showing the material and ap-
-P-A-G-E-487
  AMERICAN VIEWS OF THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. ATT 
paratus used, the methods followed, and the results achieved. These exhibits of 
actual results, used in connection with photographs, showing pupils at work, 
enabled the visitor to form a good idea of what the Chicago high schools attempt 
in science teaching, and how far it is successful. 
The science work from Massachusetts and New Jersey and from Kansas City was 
also especially strong. A unique feature of the Kansas City exhibit represented 
work done by pupils in collecting seeds, eggs, and insects, caring for them in school 
laboratories, and observing their habits and growth from day to day. Another sug- 
gestive science exhibit (sent by a New York academy) contained collections made 
by pupils during a summer excursion of several weeks, taken for the purpose of 
supplementing the regular school work by a more direct study of nature. 
In many other ways the exhibits showed that there is a marked tendency in the 
public schools of America toward introducing nature study as a part of the regular 
course of instruction and cultivating in the pupils habits of careful observationand 
experiment. After discovering important truths for themselves they are required to 
describe and interpret what they have discovered. One of the best results of this 
method is that it gives them a real interest in the language work involved and helps 
greatly in developing their power of expression. They are also required to make 
simple sketches to illustrate their notes and compositions. This fixes in their minds 
some of the more important facts and gives them an additional means of expression. 
There is, however, a real danger in allowing the average teacher to attempt to cor- 
relate language work and drawing with science, literature, history, and mathematics. 
Many of the exhibits of pupils’ work, particularly from Western States, served to 
emphasize this point. It seemed as if certain teachers who attempted correlation 
had lost their sense of proportion and allowed pupils to devote far more time and 
attention to drawings than to the subject-matter they were intended to illustrate. 
A two-hour sketch is out of place on a fifteen-minute problem in arithmetic. Itmay 
be that this error is not as widespread as the exhibits would seem to indicate, and 
that the material shown was prepared for exhibition purposes instead of being regu- 
lar school work. At any rate such exhibits were open to criticism, for if they were 
really representative they showed badly arranged work, and if not they should 
never have been sent to tlfe Exposition. 
The exhibits of form study and drawing were important features in every State 
section. They occupied the greater part of the wall space, not because they were of 
superior excellence, nor because this subject is given a conspicuous place in every 
grade of public school work, but, in most cases, simply because they were more easily 
mounted and more showy than other school products. However, there was a great 
deal of admirable work exhibited, and nearly every current method of teaching draw- 
ing was shown in one place oranother. In the New Jersey exhibit, for example, there 
were five cases of pupils’ drawings placed side by side, each showing the results of a 
different system. 
The system most fully represented in the public school section was the Prang. In 
a central location was the ‘ideal exhibit” arranged by the Prang Company. It 
contained a typical series of models and exercises intended to show a complete course 
in geometrical, constructive, and decorative drawing. Many of the neighboring 
State exhibits served to show by means of pupils’ work to what extent schools had 
succeeded in applying this system. 
The exhibit of pupils’ written work consisted of daily exercises, such as composi- 
tions, dictations, and laboratory notes; of monthly and annual examinations, and 
of occasional productions of all kinds. Unfortunately many of the latter were spe- 
cially prepared for the Exposition, and were revised and copied until it was impos- 
sible to tell what they really represented. They formed a marked contrast with the 
corresponding French exhibits. A single yolume sent from Paris by one of the 
écoles élémentaires may be taken as typical of the French method of showing pupils’ 
work. It contained all of the written exercises of a certain boy from the time he 
 
-P-A-G-E-488
    478 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
entered school, at 6 years of age, until he left, eight years later. First there was a 
picture of him taken when he entered and a preface written by his teacher to help 
readers tointerpret the work which followed. Then came exercises and examinations, 
grouped to show his progress from year to year and to illustrate the successive steps 
in the course of instruction and the methods used in teaching. There were in the 
exercises frequent corrections made by the teacher, and on the examination papers 
were the original marks, showing what credit the pupil received. There were also 
copies of his record throughout the eight years and of the certificate he received at 
graduation, together with his photograph taken at 14, He was said to be a boy of 
no more than average ability, but it makes no difference in the value of the exhibit 
whether or not this is true, because the volume represents not one student entering 
into unequal competition with others, but an individual steadily developing his fac- 
ulties and striving to improve on his own previous work. It was necessary that he 
should attend school in the same place for eight years and that all of his work should 
be preserved in order to make this exhibit possible. Neither of these conditions is 
likely to obtain in a rapidly growing community, and therefore a similar American 
exhibit would be difficult to prepare. The fundamental principle involved, viz, the 
competition of the pupil not with his classmates, but with himself, is, however, one 
that we could easily adapt to American conditions, and thus provide for a better 
gauge of the efficiency of our school work than was found in some exhibits at the 
Fair. 
Many teachers who studied the school exhibits seemed to feel that work in their 
own grade was the most important part for them to see. They gave, therefore, com- 
paratively little attention to the broader aspects of the educational exhibits and 
confined themselves almost entirely to work which was directly comparable to their 
own. This may have been the best plan for teachers whose visit to the Fair was so 
short that they could devote but little time to school exhibits, but this was not 
always the case. There were some who did not feel any interest in the exhibits 
from other grades. If our schools should follow the plan adopted by certain of the 
lower schools in Germany, viz, of promoting the teacher with the pupils, it would 
result in giving many of the teachers a wider range of interests, and thus in stimu- 
lating them to seek helpful suggestions in the work of every school grade. 
Among the World’s Fair visitors there were, of course, many teachers who took 
the broad view of education and were inclined to study, as far as their time would 
. permit, each educational exhibit. Among them none appeared to be more interested 
in all that the schools had sent than the kindergartners. They wanted to see, not 
only exhibits representing the work of kindergartens and training classes, but also 
exhibits showing whether or not the seeds planted in a ‘child garden” are given 
opportunity to grow in later school life; whether music is continuea through every 
grade; whether the skill acquired in the occupations is used as a foundation for an 
uninterrupted course in manual training; whether the development of a love for 
nature is one of the chief aims of all school work, and whether the social instinet 
which leads the kindergarten child to recognize that he is only one among many 
continues to be fostered by the study of history and the social sciences. They found 
~ indications that in certain places nearly all of these questions could be answered 
in the affirmative, and in many others they could not. 
The real kindergarten exhibits (as contrasted with the exhibits representing kin- 
dergarten features in primary schools) were not very numerous, and owing to the 
difficulty of showing the results of this early work the best of them were far from 
satisfactory. The one exception to this statement was the active exhibit in tho 
Illinois Building. There every day a group of well-equipped teachers conducted a 
model kindergarten, that showed to thousands of people during the summer a béau- 
tiful picture of happy school life. Visitors were admitted to a low gallery at one 
end of the room and were requested not to talk while there. The children were 
brought from their homes to the Fair each morning in an omnibus, and during the

session they took part in the plays and games, the songs and occupations—in every- 
thing that is characteristic of a true kindergarten—without paying the slightest 
attention to visitors or to the many distractions around them. If was a most strik- 
ing illustration of the influence exerted by a teachcr who can make the school work 
interest her pupils. There were, in addition to the exhibits sent by kindergartens 
and training classes, several representing manufacturers of kindergarten supplies. 
Each of these three classes of exhibits was of great value to teachers directly con- 
nected with the work, but to the average visitor they did not, as a rule, give very 
clear or accurate ideas. There was, however, in the Liberal Arts Gallery, one kin- 
‘dergarten exhibit that attracted a great deal of attention. It was sent by the city 
of Rochester, and contained, in addition to a large amount of material for teaching 
and of work done by pupils, a series of thirty photographs showing a kindergarten 
in session. These had been enlarged from kodak pictures taken by an artist who 
spent a day in one of the public kindergartens, sitting among the children and tak- 
ing a picture whenever he had a good opportunity. The result was a series of 
photographs representing nearly every important feature of the daily kindergarten 
programme. 
In this discussion of public school and kindergarten exhibits the writer has fol- 
Jowed the same plan as in previous articles, and has merely tried to point out some 
features of the educational section that were worthy of study, leaving it to the 
specialists in each department to estimate relative values. 
SOME ECHOES FROM THE EXPOSITION. 
[By a correspondent of Education.) 
New ideals are the heralds of progress, and teachers will come far short of their 
privilege if they fail to carry anew impulse for higher and better work into our 
educational life as the immediate fruits of the Columbian Exposition. 
The sight of works of art and industry stimulates and creates a genius to make 
them; so with the “show work” of the nations and their schools in the educational 
exhibit. The art display of the Centennial of 1876 gave us art ideals we had never 
possessed, ushered in the American renaissance, and mainly laid the foundation for 
the unique, varied, and rich United States collection of gems and masterpieces at 
Chicago. 
Like other parts of the Fair, the educational display is certainly the greatest of 
its kind in human history, and our schools must gain immensely if we set about the 
task in earnest. One has noted the mechanical excellencies alone, and this is not to 
be despised; another noted the exquisite taste, esthetics, and ethies of education; 
and others still, the natural freedom and intuitive grasp of truth, of which the most 
accurate chirography can be nothing more than the sensible dress. Some are 
enriched in hand, some in intellect, and some in soul; but all are enriched in power 
to achieve and to do. 
For the next few years these new ideals must be tested by experience and adapted 
to existing conditions and ideals, and what the gain will be can scarcely be con- 
jectured. While the genus will; no doubt, be cosmopolitism, certainly no prophet 
can foretell the species. 
Our public school system, college system, and university system are waiting to be 
welded or perhaps organized into one truly national system that will proceed from 
kindergarten to university step by step and grade by grade, without hiatus or 
duplication. 
With a system of universities like a system of national banks, public works, ete., 
established in every State and on a common basis; with a national department of 
education in charge of a competent cabinet officer and on a par with our other great 
social institutions; with Washington, the acknowledged society and civic center, 
also the educational center, reaching out to every State, and within and under the  
-P-A-G-E-490
  480 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
jurisdiction of the same touching every stage of intellectual growth—university, 
professional, and technical schools, colleges, high schools, grammar and primary 
schools, and kindergartens—the saving would be immense in time, money, and 
energy, and the gain in thus enabling the nation to adapt education to the genius of 
the American people, industrial, commercial, etc., and in advancing the standard of 
culture uniformly would be practically incalculable. Every heart throb of our edu- 
cational life would pulsate in every artery and part, however remote. 
To change the point of view let us leave the Liberal Arts Building and the math- 
ematical accuracy and military grace of Berlin, Austria, and Canada, the freer 
nativism of Johns Hopkins and Columbia, the public school naturalness and neat- 
ness, especially of some of our Western States, and step down to the Anthropological 
Building, or just over the way to the Government Building. Museums within a 
museum and again within a museum! All models of perfection in every appoint- 
ment! What a quickening interest and enthusiasm the sight of them awakens! 
Not an interest to be lost in the getting, but a sort of inspiration that comes along 
with fresh new truth just from the mine and mint. Plans partly developed often 
fail from want of a suggestive model or ideal; but here models to complement any 
ideal are on exhibition ready-made. 
We have a Smithsonian Institution, a National Museum, of which we need not be 
ashamed; but its very excellence pleads for a national system of museums—pleads 
for a museum and library for every city and town of 5,000 and more people, where 
all can go, nonschool-going as well, and drink in the truths of history, the facts of 
science, and the beauties of art. The cabinet, so serviceable just now in the public 
schools, private collections, and college and university collections are good begin- 
nings; but their number and equipment must be increased many fold. This can be 
done only by special fund or appropriation and State or national control. We are 
using, and using well, mechanical aids and apparatus, and this equally valuable aux- 
ihary of nature and art, even though it be extinct, nature asks for its rightful 
place. History first hand can be learned from things historical only, science from 
science materials, and art from art works. If the best can not be had at once, and 
for the asking, at least something vastly better than nothing is possible with every 
teacher and school. 
The American teacher is a very accommodating personage. He always has vast 
opportunities before him, too, He can always wait and patiently labor. Every 
community, village, and city has within its bounds the materials for a good begin- 
ning in mineralogy, natural history, archxology, or history and anthropology, if 
someone would start the movement and set the project on foot by collecting the 
scattered materials, relics, manuscripts, etc., and bring them in touch with the peo- 
ple and the present every-day life. He can collect legend and anecdote also, and if 
no better housing of the project is available take it to the school, the village or city 
hall; anywhere rather than not to make a start at all. Teachers know only too 
well that most cities have nothing of the kind and that many smaller cities do not 
have a general library even. Here is a bright opportunity for works that will tell. 
One more thought, some of the States have already by law provided for “free text- 
books,” apparatus, and other needful appliances, and report it a great saving and 
wise economy. Why would it not then be still better economy and more practical 
to make the provision national? With our schools supplied and equipped as a work- 
shop with all needed tools and helps, ample in quantity and variety and suitable in 
quality, always ready for use, the best would be possible. The saving in money 
would give all schools the more needful appliances now enjoyed by city and graded 
schools only. But, say you, the echo has a fading sound, is rather dim or distant. 
Beit so. Yet, standing by the Children’s Building in the twilight, a reverberating 
sound forced its way to the ear and across the tiny sea between this children’s par- 
adise and the palace of Liberal Arts, the echoes seemed to be repeating, over and 
over, in a playful and impressive music. Was it an echo or only the night wind 
calling to the dawn? “

WORLD’S EDUCATIONAL EXHIBITS. 
By Witt 8S. Monrog, in Boston Journal of Education. 
I. The purpose of the present series of articles is to give a brief survey of the 
educational exhibits from the different States and countries. The field is large and 
the task correspondingly difficult. {n a sense, the entire exhibit is educational; but 
the articles which are to follow will deal solely with the exhibition of school work 
and appurtenances. All expressions of values and all criticisms of defects are to be 
regarded as the individual opinions of the writer. Because of the extent of the 
field, the articles will deal chiefly with the exhibits from primary and secondary 
schools. 
New England is represented in the department of liberal arts by Maine, New 
Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island, Vermont having sent no 
educational work for exhibition. Massachusetts very naturally leads in the char- 
acter and size of her exhibit. Indeed, the Massachusetts exhibit is one of the best 
of the American States. The arrangement of the work could not have been better, 
and a happier choice could scarcely have been made for the superintendent than Mr, 
George E. Gay. 
The first important section is that devoted to the kindergarten, Boston, Brookline, 
Springfield, Somerville, and Holyoke furnishing large quantities of work done by 
pupils in these schools. In the primary department, Chelsea exhibits some inter- 
esting photographs of Superintendent Davis’s method of teaching reading. These 
represent nine different steps in learning to read and cover a period of three years. 
Another series of photographs represents the work in language. The State course 
in drawing for a period of three years is fully represented. Springfield sends one of 
the most complete exhibits in drawing, and the work reflects great credit on the city 
and Miss Luella E, Fay (now Mrs. Maynard), the late supervisor of drawing. The 
best work in clay modeling comes from Boston and Quincy. A surprise to all inspect- 
ors of the Boston school work is the fact that no work is done with pen and ink 
during the first three years of the school course. That the children lose by the con- 
tinued use of pencil is evidenced by the comparison in grades above the third of the 
penmanship of Boston with that of other cities where writing with pen is earlier 
introduced. Some interesting work in the form of observation lessons comes from 
Boston. ‘These lessons consist of descriptions and drawings of the frog, grasshopper, 
erab, dragon fly, and other typical forms of animal life. Most of the work in elemen- 
tary science from the Somerville schools is excellent. 
In the grammar department, Brookline exhibits some sixth-year botany work 
which is unusually strong and a study, both theoretical and practical, of domestic 
economy which classifies the foods and chemical changes which take place in their 
preparation, The original compositions from Chelsea are well written and well 
illustrated. Lawrence, Worcester, and Brookline show lines of local study in plants,” 
minerals, and insects. The compositions and drawings which illustrate historic 
ornament from the standpoint of the grammar grade pupils of Springfield are both 
creditable and unique, and the extended exhibit of work in arithmetic, under Super- 
intendent Balliet, from the same city is unexcelled. 
The exhibit of high school work in Massachusetts is one of its strongest depart- 
ments, and the work of the Boston high schools is the best. The papers in English 
are uniformly good, and some superior work is exhibited illustrating the study of 
chemistry. Malden also offers some excellent work in chemistry. The pupils are 
given a series of thirty-six problems to solve by laboratory methods. Cases show 
the results, and notebooks and drawings show the equations and processes. The pen- 
and-ink drawings, which illustrate a series of lectures and experiments in elec- 
tricity in the Malden high school, are very creditable. The flora of Berkshire 
County is carefully worked up by the pupils of the Pittsfield high school, and the 
ED 93. 31    
-P-A-G-E-492
  482 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
original sketches of the pupils in the Holyoke high school show careful training in 
free sketching. An interesting feature of the Salem high school exhibit is the local 
history of that vicinity. The sketches were all written and the photographs all 
taken by the members of the high school. The work from the Westfield high school 
was not prepared for exhibition, but was the regular daily work of the pupils. 
Worcester also exhibited the regular drawing books of the pupils. 
An important section of the Massachusetts exhibit is the work in manual training. 
Boston exhibits three lines of work—the Eliot course, which in some features is not 
unlike the work from Springtiela; the Larsson sloid course, consisting of thirty: 
one models and covering four school years; and the Eddy course, which is a combi- 
nation of the sloid and Russian systems. The exhibit in manual training from 
Springfield is in most respects excellent. The wood carving and the work in iron 
are better than similar lines from other schools, although the B. M. C. Durfee high 
school at Fall River exhibits some good pieces of wood turning. The Horace Mann 
School for the deaf has a good line of woodwork on exhibition. The Ling system 
of gymnastics is ‘illustrated by photographs in seventy-two different positions, and 
the Boston Normal School of Gymnastics by a similar series of photographs showing 
the different movements of the system. 
There are some unique features about the exhibit of the State normal school at 
Worcester. One of these is the collection of opinions of former students on the 
comparative usefulness of the different lines of training given them at the school. 
Each pupil in this school is assigned one order of plants which she is expected to 
study during her course and report as fully as possible at graduation, and these 
reports give. great encouragement to the future study of local systematic botany. 
The individual laboratories constructed and used by the students in the State nor- 
mal school at Bridgewater reach the high-water mark of modern teaching and reflect 
corresponding credit on Mr. Arthur C. Boyden, the head of the science department. 
The Massachusetts exhibit, althougn one of the largest, is one of the easiest to 
study, not simply because of its excellent classification, but chiefly because of the 
introductory explanations which are to be found in all the bound volumes of written 
work, 
Harvard University has a very full exhibit of charts and apparatus, illustrating 
more especially the work of her scientific departments. But one looks in vain for 
some charts referring to the work of the department of education. The Massachu- 
setts Institute of Technology has the best graphic charts to be found in the depart- 
ment of liberal arts. The theses of the class of 1892 are exhibited entire, and many 
of these are illustrated by elaborate drawings. Amherst, Tufts, and Williams col- 
leges have a good line of photographs and charts, and Clark University presents a 
strong array of publications which emanate from that institution. The women’s 
colleges of Massachusetts—Wellesley, Smith, and Mount Holyoke—have a good ex- 
hibition of buildings and teaching appliances; and the International Institute for 
Girls in Spain and the American College for Girls at Constantinople—both organized 
undér the laws of Massachusetts—exhibit examination papers and industrial work 
done by their pupils. 
Connecticut is represented chiefly at the educational exhibit by the work of a 
half dozen of her larger cities. That of New Haven is uniformly good. The coordi- 
nation of language drawing and literature is better than much of similar work 
found in the Massachusetts exhibit. Bridgeport exhibits a series of general infor” 
mation and culture charts and the written work of the pupils who follow this course. 
There are some good descriptions and colored drawings of colonial flags in the Water- 
bury exhibit and some very fair illustrations of the historical work at Stamford. 
New Britain sends a large exhibit from her State normal school, the most striking 
features of which seem to be the work in drawing and color and the nature studies, 
The State normal school at Willimantic illustrates very forcefully the possibilities 
in tho line of homemade apparatus. Bristol contributes a rather unique volume.

            483 
It consists of drawn figures dressed in clothes made by the children, There are a 
~ score or more figures and representing national characteristics, as Our Sailor Boy, 
The German Peasant, etc. Yale University has a very extended collection of bromide 
prints of buildings, laboratories, and class rooms. 
One of the best features of the Connecticut exhibit is the bookcase containing a 
complete set of the educational writings of Dr. Henry Barnard of Hartford—by 
common consent the most complete and valuable series of books on education to be 
found in any language. The collection includes the thirty-one volumes of the Ameri- 
can Journal of Education, more than twenty volumes of treatises on educational 
subjects, the Connecticut Common School Journal, and Rhode Island Institute of 
Instruction, both of which he edited, as well as his annual reports as State superin- 
tendent of Connecticut and Rhode Island and United States Commissioner of Edu- 
cation. The collection also includes over cight hundred pamphlets on education 
which were edited and printed by Dr. Barnard. This entire collection isa monument 
to the zeal and scholarship of a great educational leader. 
The best work in the Rhode Island exhibit comes from Pawtucket, and consists 
mainly in related work in language and elementary science. The pen drawings 
which illustrate the same are in some instances excellent. Several of the bound 
volumes from the Pawtucket high school are also strong. Pictures cut from illus- 
trated papers seem to form the basis of most of the primary language work in Proy- 
idence. Newport exhibits the work that is being done with nature studies, but in 
the matter of expression the papers are not as full and clear as those from Paw- 
tucket. Some of the best wood carving to be found at the exhibit comes from the 
Friends’ School at Providence. Some good work in iron and wood is to be found in 
the exhibit of the Lockanosset School. Designing and photographs constitute the 
chief features of the Rhode Island State normal school exhibit. Brown University 
has models of the Lyman Gymnasium and the Ladd Observatory, and Commissioner 
Stockwell has a complete set of the annual reports on exhibition. 
The exhibits from Maine and New Hampshire are not especially large. Of the 
former, Lewiston has the fullest exhibit, the best features of which are the pencil 
drawings and the descriptions of hills. Bath, Rockland, Gardiner, Richmond, Cam- 
den, Bangor, Waterville, and Augusta all have a limited amount of work on exhibi- 
tion. The best part of the Bangor work is the illustrations on the covers of the 
pound volumes of written work. The State normal schools at Farmington, Gorham, 
and Castine all send photographs, and Farmington, in addition, some good drawings 
and written papers. The New Hampshire State normal school sends a full line of 
the examination papers of the pupils. The written exercises in vocal music from 
the schools of Nashua are some of the most interesting that have come to the notice 
of the writer. There is also from Nashua some strong seventh-year language work. 
The language work from Portsmouth seems also good. That of Littleton is based 
largely upon pictures. Phillips Exeter Academy is represented in the New Hamp- 
shire exhibit by photographs. 
II. The group of Middle States—New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Dela- 
ware—are all well represented, except Delaware. New York has the largest exhibit, 
and New Jersey, in some respects, the best. The New York State exhibit represents 
very fully all the educational interests of the Empire State—the institutions man- 
aged by the regents, as well as those managed by the department of public instruc- 
tion. A feature of the New York exhibit which adds materially to its interest is 
the series of attractive handbooks given to visitors, These explain very fully the 
aim and character of the work of the different institutions. 
New York City sends the largest exhibit. A great number of bound volumes, rep- 
resenting tho different subjects taught in the primary and grammar grades, are 
submitted. ‘There seems to be little coordination of these various subjects, and the 
language and composition work of the lower grades, to a great extent, is technical. 
There are several volumes of language Work, however, from the manual training . AMERICAN VIEWS OF THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION.

  schevls which are quite strong; and some good seventh-year work in geometry is to 
be found in the New York City exhibit. 
Buffalo offers photographs of her pupils. The sand maps made by the pupils of 
the Cambridge Union School are better than most similar maps that have come to 
the attention of the writer. The sloid work of the girls in the Albany high school 
seems better than that of the boys. The State normal school of Oswego exhibits a 
full line of the text-books in use, as well as the books written by the alumni and 
faculty. An interesting phase oi the werk in psychology from Oswego is the intro- 
spective essays, in which the students tell the story of their own early lives. 
The school of pedagogy connected with the University of the City of New York 
exhibits some graphic charts illustrating tests in vertical writing and in ear-minded- 
ness and eye-mindedness; also an interesting line of old text-books belonging to 
Prof. Jerome Allen and used in the historical classes. The mechanical drawings and 
water colors from the Mechanics’ Institute at Rochester are strong, and the College 
for the Training of Teachers, New York City, presents 2 line of work in thin wood, 
with drawing applications, that seems both ideal ané practical. This institution 
has solved an important problem in the invention of a manual training desk cover, 
which admits of the regular schoolroom being used as a workshop. Felix Adler’s 
Workingman’s School has a good exhibit in manual training. The library features 
of the exhibit of the University of the State of New York are admirably illustrated. 
The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute at Troy makes an interesting exhibit in maps, 
charts, and photographs, as do also Cornell University and Columbia College. The 
exhibit from Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, is certainly one of the best of its kind to be 
found in the Building of Liberal Arts. The free-hand drawings of casts, still life, 
sketches, and composition studies are excellent. The original designs applied to 
book covers, wall paper, oilcloth, silk goods, and draperies evince great skill and 
art training. The normal art course, under Walter 8. Perry’s direction, is in every 
sense a splendid educational exhibit. 
Pennsylvania is represented chiefly by Philadelphia, Pittsburg, Reading, Harris- 
burg, Allegheny, and the colleges of the State. The department of public instruction 
has a full set of the State reports and the Pennsylvania School Journal, as well as a 
very complete map showing the educationalinstitutions, both elementary and higher, 
in the Keystone State. Inthe Philadelphia exhibit one finds some ingenious papers 
and drawings illustrating historically the development of the nation, and some good 
pen-and-ink drawings from the girls of the normal school. The one feature of the 
Philadelphia exhibit which stands out strongest is the manual training schools—the 
workin wood and iron and the sewing. The possibilities of this work seem very great 
when one notes the various forms of expression which the teachers in these schools 
call to their aid. One finds, for instance, the electric plant which the pupils have 
made for themselves, applications of drawing in Greek architecture and historical 
art, graphic illustrations in ancient history and literature, pattern making, design- 
ing of calico, and economic botany studied in relation to the native woods. Gar- 
ments are made by the girls in grades from the third to the eighth, and the sewing 
throughout seems very good. . 
The penmanship in the Pittsburg schools in all grades below the high school is 
good, and in the sixth and seventh years there is some good language work. One 
fails, however, to find any central line of thought as the basis of the language les- 
sons. ‘There are some creditable applications of drawing to wood carving, and a 
pretty complete exhibition of sloid as carried on in one school. Alleghany sends 
the strongest line of language work from Pennsylvania. Geography and elementary 
science furnish the materials for thought expression, and pen drawings are freely 
used as an auxiliary. The language work from Hazleton consists mainly in writing 
from pictures, while that from Altoona is largely descriptions from natural objects. 
Chester has some strong compositions on the native woods and Titusville some good 
drawings from nature, Harrisburg has a very complete exhibit of work in drawing,
-P-A-G-E-495
  
  AMERICAN VIEWS OF THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 485 
including a good deal of work in designing and use of color. The State normal 
schools have very meager exhibits. The school at Slippery Rock has submitted the 
fullest line of work done by pupils, and the school at Millersville has a very credit- 
able display of lesson plans, schedules, and photographs. 
Pennsylvania State College exhibits an interesting piece of apparatus—a dynamo 
for electrolytic work—designed and made by the students. Bryn Mawr College for 
Women exhibits the best model of buildings and grounds to be found in the educa- 
tional exhibits, and the University of Pennsylvania illustrates very fully her working 
laboratory in physiology. The giant microtome, designed by Dr. Milton J. Greeman, 
attracts very general interest. The dyed cotton, woolen, and silk yarns from Lehigh 
University are of special interest to the students of chemistry, as well as the chemi- 
cally pure salts prepared by students. Girard College has a full line of work in 
wood and iron, and the Ogontz School is represented by a good series of photographs 
and water-color paintings. 
New Jersey has solved the problem of economy of space. Her exhibit is compact 
and satisfactory, and represents a wide range of educational interests. The State 
normal school exhibit is one of the best. The music charts made by the teachers in 
the primary schools of Trenton are unique. The pen drawings from the New Bruns- 
wick high school are interesting, as are also the zoological drawings from Jersey 
City. Some of the best language work comes from Plainfield, and the best clay 
modeling from Morristown. Camden sends from her fifth grade a varied line of 
work in tin—cups, dippers, pans, funnels, etc. The wood carving from Montclair 
and South Orange is excellent. The exhibit from the State normal school is very 
satisfactory. The papers submitted by the classes in the history of education and 
psychology show healthy lines of study. ‘In the latter subject no text-book is used. 
The students are given problems and experiments, the results of which form an 
interesting feature of the exhibit. The pen and language work of the model school 
is uniformly good. A very pretty and costly piece of work in the New Jersey exhibit 
is a large satin map of the State made by the students of the Institute of the Holy 
Angels at Fort Lee. Princeton University submits 3,000 volumes written by gradu- 
ates and officers of that institution, which is scarcely more than a third of the 
whole number that have been written. There is also from Princeton a very satis- 
factory series of photographs of the student life—social, literary, religious, and 
athletic. 
Ill. But few of the States of the South are represented at the educational exhibit. 
Texas, which is doing so much for her schools, sent nothing. The best exhibit south 
of Mason and Dixon’s line is that of Arkansas, 67 towns of that State having con- 
tributed something to the exhibit. There are 57 bound volumes from Little Rock, 
one-third of which is the work of colored children. Photographs of all the white 
and all the colored school children of the city accompany the display. A great deal 
of attention seems to be given to making outline maps, although there are some good 
descriptions of plants. Fort Smith had a good display of pen-and-ink drawings 
from the high school, and pencil drawings from the lower grades. The pressed and 
mounted flowers from Hot Springs are creditably arranged, and the photographs of 
all the school children are of interest. The country and village schools exhibit a 
great amount of spelling in columns and technical grammar, but the ability to write 
good English is uniformly weak. 
The better part of the Maryland exhibit comes from Baltimore. Some interesting 
graphic charts are exhibited showing the occupations of the children of that city. 
The language work through the lower grades is stiff, but the penmanship in most 
instances is excellent. There is some very good work in wood from the colored man- 
ual training school. A number of the subjects pursued in the high school are taken 
upin the grammar grades of most othercities. The Baltimore manual training school 
has a large and creditable exhibit of work in wood and iron and several complicated 
pieces of machinery. The Woman’s College of Baltimore exhibits some suggestive

tables showing the increase of physical development of girls after six months’ exer-’ 
cise in the Swedish educational gymnastics. The Johns Hopkins University has a 
neat display of photographs and publications. One is impressed with the range of 
the latter in the higher regions of intellectual activity. ‘} 
In bulk the Florida exhibit is not small. The St. Augustine high schools show 
aseries of blue prints that have been developed in the chemical laboratory. The 
English work in the Jacksonville high school scarcely bears comparison with middle- 
grade grammar work in most Northern cities. Much of the language work through- 
out the South seems to be confined to technical grammar. The geography work 
centers largely about map questions, and these too often of no importance. In some 
instances the teachers have added introductory prefaces to the volumes of bound 
work in which they give their aims and methods. One teacher, in concluding one of 
these prefaces, writes: ‘‘The result of my method is very evident and in many cases 
surprising. For instance, one of my pupils, just entering her eighth year, began the 
study of geography. In three months’ time she could from memory name almost 
every country in the world and the capital.” Another: ‘I have a pupil of 15 who 
excels anything I have seen in city schools. She can, entirely from memory, name 
every country, province, and state in the world; give its capital, largest city, sea- 
port, principal mountains, rivers, and lakes; also the exports and imports of every 
country of any importance, She knows the bays and gulfs that indent the coasts of 
both continents, the seas and their location, the islands and their situation.” Poor 
child! 
Kentucky has a large exhibit, but it has been overloaded with red and blue rib- 
bon—a fault which Kentucky shares in common with at least a half dozen Northern 
States. The largest display comes from the Louisville Free Kindergarten Associa- 
tion, which is somewhat marred by the inharmonious conibinations of colors. Padu- 
cah has some good charcoal drawing, and some helpful scrapbooks for teaching 
geography and history, The manual training work from Louisville and the pen- 
manship from some of the colored schools in Frankfort are both good. The illus- 
trated. number work that one finds at Ashland is along the line of better objective 
teaching in the primary grades. Comparing the work of the pupils of the colored 
schools with that of the pupils in the white schools, one is sure to find greater uni- 
formity in the case of the latter. The degrees of excellence in the colored schools 
are much more likely to vary than in the schools for the whites. 
IV. Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois are all represented with large and creditable dis- 
plays of school work. The three large cities of Ohio—Cleveland, Cincinnati, and 
Columbus—have separate booths, while the remaining towns of the State exhibit in 
bulk. One thing that impresses the inspector of the Cleveland exhibit is the free- 
dom in the drawing work. It may in some instances transgress the lesser canons of 
art, but it is always free and expressive. The English papers from the Cleveland 
high school are good and show considerable individuality, but the English of the 
English papers is better than the English of the history papers in the same school. 
The graphic charts from Cleveland are an interesting feature of the exhibit, and one 
of the departures noted is the pedagogical library. Judge Draper has been able to 
make an arrangement with the city library by which the pedagogical books have 
been segregated and a teachers’ reading room provided. 
Cincinnati has not been afraid to display the first year’s work. In studying the 
exhibit of this city the impress of Dr. White’s educational doctrines is everywhere 
apparent, The drawing and color work, which follows the lines given by Miss 
Sullivan in her manuals, forms an important part of the exhibit; and the natural 
history charts in water colors, made by the girls of the normal school, show con- 
siderable ingenuity. Columbus has also exhibited a full line of water-color work in 
the high school and some wood carvings from the fifth grade, which seem to the 
writer unusually meritorious. The high school at Wapakoneta has prepared a 
creditable exhibit of native woods; and some fairly good written work comes from 
the smaller towns.

Indiana, like Massachusetts, has been singularly fortunate in the selection of a 
State superintendent of educational exhibits. The strength of the Indiana exhibit 
is due to two cities—Indianapolis and Laporte—although some of the counties 
make creditable showings. At Indianapolis there is a principle which underlies all 
the work of the primary grades; it is the coordination of all the school work in 
nature studies. ‘The reading, the language, the drawing, the spelling, the form study 
all relate to the development and expression of thought in connection with elementary 
science. And there is a freedom and an excellence in all this written work that is 
delightful. ‘Standard American literature is similarly treated in the grammar grades, 
Laporte does not take second rank in the quality of her work, although the method 
here is subjective rather than objective, as at Indianapolis. The development of social 
relationships is a great purpose with Dr, Hailmann, and he develops it admirably 
throughout the grades of his schools. Form study here, to some extent, takes the 
place of plants and animals as the center of thought development, although the 
objects in nature are used, and to great advantage, in much of his work. The social. 
creative work with tiles and paper cutting applies very happily this idea of Dr. Hail- 
mann’s. In both the language and’ the drawing one is impressed with the work at 
Laporte as with that of Indianapolis in its spontaneity. There is little work below 
the high-school grades in technical grammar, but there is great clearness and freedom 
in all the written work. The counties of Indiana send pretty full exhibits. That 
of Wayne County is creditable in its language work, and that of Wabash is fairly 
good. One little district school—that of Miss Della Brown—makes a good showing 
for Marion County. The town of Hammond has uniformly fair work in language 
and drawing, with literature as the basis, and La Fayette, in her illustrated lan- 
guage work, makes a creditable display. South Bend, Richmond, and Terre Haute 
scarcely compare with the smaller towns above mentioned. Set questions and 
answers never test the character and quality of good work, and much of the written 
work from these towns consists of answers to examination questions. Mrs, Hail- 
mann has a very full exhibit from her kindergarten training class in mat weaving, 
paper cutting, etc. A profitable feature of Mrs. May Wright Sewell’s exhibit is the 
stenographic reports of lessons in her Classical School for Girls at Indianapolis, and 
these not revised. Purdue University makes a very large exhibit, especially in its 
mechanical departments. There students make not only the machinery used, but 
also the tools with which the machinery is made. There are also in the Indiana 
exhibit photographs and graphic charts from the State normal school and the State 
university. : 
Illinois has exhibited in her own State building, and the Cook County Normal 
School in the assembly room of the Children’s Building. Chicago rightly takes a 
great part of the space of the educational exhibit. In drawing, the display is 
strong, but the uniform excellence of the entire exhibit can scarcely be compared 
with St. Paul and Minneapolis or the spontaneity with that of Indianapolis and 
Laporte. The language work of the primary grades is unequal, and there is great 
diversity in penmanship. The science work in the high schools, as manifested by 
the quality of the drawings and the character of the written work, seems very 
good, and there are some excellent eighth grade language papers, illustrated with 
pen drawings, especially those of the Franklin School. The high school work in 
language from Peoria seems proportionately better than that of the lower grades. 
Kewanee has a full line of work in elementary science from the first to the eighth 
grades. The work in elementary science and language from Aurora impressed the © 
writer as being somewhat better than similar work from other towns, excepting, 
however, the Cook County Normal School. Galesburg sends several claborate pieces 
of woodwork—a hatrack and a bureau—as the fruit of her manual training depart- 
ment. The Morris high school contributes an interesting collection of geological 
specimens representing the coal flora of Illinois. The model schoolroom, sitted up by 
the United States Furniture Company under the direction of State Superintendent

Raab, is interesting in representing the ideal of an experienced schoolman. The 
State normal schools both have large exhibits. That at Carbondale has a unique 
series of reading charts made by the pupil teachers; and the series of readers made 
for the use of the children in teaching fables, stories, and poems at Bloomington 
are equally original and interesting. The University of Illinois represents very 
fully all her departments, with emphasis upon the engineering. courses; and the 
institutions for defective classes—the deaf, the dumb, the blind, and the feeble- 
minded—make an excellent showing. 
The exhibit from the Cook County Normal School in the Children’s Building is of 
great importance to the student of education, because it represents some of the 
newer lines of school work. The papers throughout are characterized by great 
freedom. They may be faulty in mechanism, but the thought to be expressed is not 
allowed to be stifled by mechanical forms. Nature study forms the basis of a large 
‘part of the language work, although literature, geography, and history are earlier 
introduced than in most schools.. The child not only begins to draw in the lowest 
grades, but he begins as well to color his drawings, and these drawings and color- 
ings are always made with the object in sight. ‘There is much work with birds, and 
the work is good. Historic ornament in connection with teaching history furnishes 
some excellent papers. Some good illustrated number work comes from Mr. Giffin’s 
department; and many of the maps exhibited by the geography classes are of asupe- 
rior grad One may find fault with the penmanship in the primary grades, which 
certainly is inferior to that of most school work from the cities, but if Colonel Parker 
succeeds in making rapid and legible writers in the higher grades this may be over- 
looked. 
V. The three great States of the Northwest—Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota— 
are all represented in the department of liberal arts. That of Michigan does not 
include some of the best schools of the State—Detroit, for instance; and the exhibit 
from Wisconsin is so unfortunately arranged that it does not do the schools of the 
State justice. The exhibit from Minnesota, on the contrary, is superb—one of the 
very best to be found, if not the best. 
One-half of the Wisconsin exhibit comes from the city of Milwaukee, and a great 
portion of this display represents the work of the kindergartens and the teaching of 
German. Most of the geography work consists of answers to set questions. The 
language work of the primary grades, in some instances, is better than that of the 
grammar grades, and the Oral School for the Deaf submits some language papers that 
are very creditable. There are some good brush studies from copies made by the 
pupils in the Milwaukee high school. Racine has some special work in American 
authors that is quite good, and a number of the rural schools exhibit pretty full 
lines of their work. Downer College, of which Miss Sabin is president, has a good 
display of photographs, as have also Beloit and Ripon colleges. The State normal 
schools exhibit in alcove together; but their work, like that of the State in general, 
lacks good arrangement, and the placing of the color studies in some cases is unfor- 
tunate. The University of Wisconsin is represented by a goodly number of photo- 
graphs and charts. 
Michigan has a pretty large exhibit, but it does not represent a great number of 
schools. Some of the best work comes from Muskegon. One week’s work in ele- 
mentary science forms an interesting volume. There is from the same city some good 
illustrated number papers and a full line of kindergarten work. Some of the paper 
pulp maps from Bay City are skillfully made, and the illustrated language work of 
the sixth grade at Grand Haven is fairly well done. An interesting feature of the 
East Saginaw exhibit is a set of photographs including all the pupils and teachers, 
The English work from the Ann Arbor high school is good, and the physics note 
books show unusually fine applications of laboratory methods. The State normal 
school has a display of drawings, charts, and photographs, and the State agricul- 
tural college makes a very complete exhibit of all its departments, as does also the 
University of Michigan. 
     
-P-A-G-E-499
  AMERICAN VIEWS OF THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 489 
But the great educational exhibit from the Northwest comes from the State of 
Minnesota. Most of the cities of the State have sent full lines of work; but the 
amount and excellence of the work from St.Paul and Minneapolis throw into the 
shade much very good work from outside of the twin cities. One who studies the 
work of St. Paul and Minneapolis in language and science, geography and history, 
arithmetic and drawing, manual training and. domestic economy, is bound to con- 
clude that these two cities have reached the highest mark of American education, 
The display of both cities is so strong that one is not inclined to determine which is 
the stronger. And itis not in one subject or two subjects that these cities excel, 
but in all the subjects that they pretend to teach. The excellence of the work is 
delightfully uniform. The work in language in both cities clusters about elemen- 
tary science, literature, history, and geography, and drawing is always advanta- 
geously used to illustrate the written work. St.Paul exhibits in ten panels her 
system of manual training, and Minneapolis has several pieces of wood carving that 
are unexcelled. Stillwater also has a number of pieces of good wood carving. Wi- 
nona sends a unique geographical cabinet, and Duluth some good relief maps. ,The 
State normal schools at Winona, St. Cloud, Morehead, and Mankato all make credit- 
able exhibits, that of Winona being the largest and strongest. There is strength and 
freedom to the language and drawing work of these schools, characteristics which 
they share with Minneapolis, St. Paul, Duluth, Stillwater, Winona, and many of the 
goodrural schools. Carleton College, St. Olaf College, Hamline College, and the Uni- 
versity of Minnesota are all represented, chiefly by photographs. But the strength 
of the Minnesota exhibit rests almost wholly on the work of the primary and gram- 
‘mar grades. 
VI. The exhibit from Missouri is large and on the whole excelleat. Both in quantity 
and quality, the best part of it comes from the two large cities, St. Louis and Kansas 
City. The kindergarten display from St. Louis has many good features, as have the 
displays of primary and grammar grade work. There are many yolumes of written 
work which are beautifully and substantially bound, One of the best features of 
the St. Louis exhibit is the illustrated language papers. There is freedom in expres- 
sion, accuracy in mechanism, and beauty in execution throughout. Pen drawings 
are used in great numbers to illustrate written papers, and they are well used. There 
are many good exercises in history and biography in grades as low as the third and 
fourth. Elementary science receives considerable attention in the primary and 
grammar schools, and the papers and drawings from one of the colored schools seem 
Letter than those of a corresponding grade in one of the white schools. Both the 
colored and the white pupils make a good showing in high school work. 
Kansas City makes an admirable showing in penmanship. In the first and second 
years, at least, it is better than in most other cities. This excellence is no doubt due 
to the fact that the child in Kansas City begins using pen and ink after he is in 
school four months. The illustrated language papers here, as in St. Louis, are unique 
and strong, especially in the sixth and seventh grades. There is also some good his- 
tory work in the seventh year. The language work of the colored children in Kan- 
sas City in no instance approximates that of the white children. The State exhibit 
from Missouri is good because the exhibits from St. Louis and Kansas City are good. 
The State normal schools certainly make a very poor showing, their academic work 
being much below the grade of similar lines in the high schools of the two great 
cities. : 
The statistical charts and diagrams exhibited by Iowa are among the very best, 
and the state department has on file a complete set of its reports and other official 
documents. Sioux City has an exhibit that is interesting and rather nnusual—pho- 
nographic records of work in reading, singing, geography, and number. The oper- 
ator starts the machine and the visitor may hear a Sioux City recitation in any or 
all of these subjects. Clinton exhibits a good deal of illustrated language and num- 
ber work, and some of it is good. Some of the geography charts from Cedar Falls 
 
-P-A-G-E-500
    490 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
are well made. The language work from Des Moines (East) is perhaps the best sub- 
mitted, in that freedom in the expression of thought is greater. - The cooking exhibit 
from West Des Moines is very good. Several of the rural schools send full lines of 
photographs. The State normal school is represented by a good deal of homemade 
apparatus, drawings showing the development of the synthetic sound system, and 
some good written lessons in science. 
Kansas has made two exhibits—one in her State building and one in the depart- 
ment of liberal arts. Topeka exhibits considerable work in technical grammar. 
Local geography, so called, is early introduced, and much of it is of a rather tech- 
nical character. Writing is by pen and ink from the first, and the penmanship in 
consequence is excellent throughout. The best language work submitted from 
Topeka is that labeled “miscellaneous ”—compositions on common things. Wichita 
has a pretty full exhibit of paper cutting and folding and designing, but the color 
combinations are scarcely more than fair. Some of the pictorial work in history is 
unique, the dates being supplanted by pictures on outline maps. Writing here, as 
in Topeka, is with pen and ink from the first, and the results in the first and second 
years are admirable. A good deal of the language work consists in writing from 
pictures cut from papers, with little effort on the part of the children to make their 
own illustrations. Lawrence has the best illustrated language work. The same 
city makes considerable use of free-hand drawing. Colored picture cards form the 
basis of language work at Leavenworth, with analyzing and diagraming of sentences 
as low as the fifth grade. The district schools of Greenwood and Doniphan counties 
make a fairly good showing in their written work. The State normal school of 
Kansas ma u good exhibit in its laboratory work in botany and homemade appa- 
ratus in physics. There are some clever stanzas of doggerel in the versification 
exercises and some ingenious charts and diagrams in the work in English literature. 
The exhibit of North American animals from the University of Kansas is large and 
excellent, and the agricultural college illustrates pretty fully the work in house- 
hold economy and floriculture. The diagrams, showing the relative time given to 
each subject of study, are full and interesting. The Institution for the Education of 
the Deaf and Dumb at Olanthe exhibits some good written work, and some well- 
made harness from the industrial department. 
The Nebraska exhibit, in size at least, does not equal the Kansas exhibit. Omaha, 
the largest city, sends no manuscript work, but a pretty full line of drawing and 
manual training. Nebraska City has some pretty good language work, and Kearney 
some well-prepared music exercises in the tonic sol-fa. Beatrice has a number of 
photographs illustrating the outdoor gymnastic exercises of the pupils. The ele- 
mentary botany and the drawings from Crete are for the most part good. Pawnee 
has made a valuable collection of the woods and vines of Nebraska and mounted 
these for teaching purposes. The girls of the Scribner high school have made a 
pretty silk map of the State, and a good drawing of the Mason School, Omaha, on a 
marble slab, comes from one of the grammar grade boys of that city. The Uni- 
versity of Nebraska is represented by photographs. While there is considerable 
good work-from Nebraska, too much of it consists of answers to set questions, and 
such answers never show to advantage the written work of the schools. 
VII. The Rocky Mountain States exhibiting school work at the Fair are the 
Dakotas, Montana, Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. North Dakota did not send 
a large exhibit, but the wonder is that a State so new should have sent any. There 
are a large number of photographs of town and district schools, considerable paper 
cutting, folding, and weaving, and some good pen drawings. South Dakota’s exhibit 
is somewhat larger. It includes maps showing the school lands and buildings and 
a good separate exhibit of the country schools, The language work in these schools 
is mostly confined to exercises in technical grammar. Sioux Falls makes the fullest 
exhibit. Aberdeen exhibits the first schoolhouse (in miniature) built in South 
Dakota. The University of Dakota has a number of photographs and a type- 
written history of the institution.    
  
       
-P-A-G-E-501
  AMERICAN VIEWS OF THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. AOL 
Excepting Washington, Montana has the fullest exhibit of the new States, The 
Helena schools have a pretty good line of pictorial language work with fables as 
the basis. Theslatesof the school children of Anaconda, containing daily exercises, 
have been photographed. Stevensville has sent a large papier-maché map of Mon- 
tana. Butte shows good muscular movement penmanship exercises. The exhibit 
from Utah occupies three small alcoves, and is classified into city schools, rural 
schools, and colleges. The best work from Salt Lake City is the drawing, with sev- 
eral good pieces of sixth-year language work. The exhibit from the rural schools 
shows better penmanship throughout than one finds in similar schools of other 
States. The Agricultural College and the University of Utah are both represented 
in the exhibit by photographs and written work. Far-off New Mexico, with less 
than 6C0 teachers, makes an exhibit. East Las Vegas has prepared a history of 
educational work in that section covering the period of the beginnings of the mis- 
sion fathers down to the present, and illustrated it with photographs. It is a com- 
mendable effort to place in permanent form the labors of pioneers. Silver City has 
some relief maps that are not without credit, Albuquerque photographs and written 
work, and Raton has shipped some of her blackboards with the pupils’ drawings 
thereon. 
But the pride of the Rocky Mountains—of the country, for that matter—is Colo- 
rado, Her exhibit, like that of Minnesota, has been arranged with great taste, and 
the white and gold of the woodwork give it a pleasing setting. The state depart- 
ment has sent complete samples of the records and publications. The relief map of 
Pike’s Peak and vicinity, which is a creditable piece of workmanship, was made by 
the science department of the Colorado Springs high school. The same city sends a 
model of her high school, and a most suggestive piece of geographical apparatus, 
“an Indian camp,” the work of a third-year class. Denver—or more properly speak- 
ing, the Denvers—has the largest and best part of the exhibit. The work is strong 
along several lines, notably drawing and music. And Denver offers something strik- 
ingly new in the way of exhibits—stenographic reports of the regular school exer- 
cises and phonographic records of the work in music, including singing at sight, the 
only such exercise to be found among the exhibits. The stenographers have faith- 
fully reproduced the regular lessons given in the Denver schools, and these repro- 
ductions reflect great credit on Superintendent Grove and his associates. The 
library feature of the Denver high school is a departure that is likely to be followed 
by many other cities. Some of the manual training work from Pueblo schools is 
good. The State normal school at Greeley makes an excellent showing in the 
exhibit of its regular work. Science is made prominent, and sloid woodwork is 
exhibited from all grades. The illustrated language papers throughout are good, 
and the tonic sol-fa exercises show what is being done in music. The School of 
Mines and the Agricultural College are both represented in the exhibit. Taken 
altogether, the exhibit from Colorado shows what intelligence and money will do to 
build up a system of schools in a comparatively brief period of time. 
VIII. Persons familiar with the excellence of the California schools are not a little 
disappointed to find that the best educational exhibit from the Pacific Coast comes 
from the new State of Washington. Two reasons may be given for this failure of 
the Golden State to meet the expectation of her friends: First, the bad arrangement 
of the work sent; and second, the absence of school work from San Francisco and 
several other of the larger cities. The work was placed in the California Building 
because of the appropriation, which made it possible to make the exhibit. * * * 
San Francisco sent nothing. Los Angeles nothing but a few pieces of drawing. 
Neither Sacramento nor Stockton sent any school work. The exhibit from Oakland 
is the largest and the best. It compares favorably with the work of Eastern cities. 
The drawing is an attractive feature, being especially strong in historic ornament, 
with a good sequence of industrial drawing. The language and science papers 
throughout are well written and well illustrated, and the physiology papers from the   
   
-P-A-G-E-502
    
  492 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
grammar grades have attracted a good deal of attention. The high school work in 
English is good, and there are some unique class book designs which would do 
credit to our best comic journals. 
Nowhere in the exhibit is there better work from a village school than that sent 
from Temescal. -It is strong throughout and shows correlation and intelligent appli- 
cation of modern educational theories. The language work is by all odds the best 
from California; and the nature studies, the water-color sketches, and the arith- 
metic papers are very good. Pasadena sends some good work in elementary science 
and grammar grade English, and Pomona has some neatly illustrated papers in 
literature. The language lessons written from pictures in the district schools of 
Humboldt County are good, as are those on bees from Monterey County. The spon- 
taneous drawings from Napa are exceedingly suggestive, and Sonoma County makes 
a very full and creditable exhibit. The music from San Diego is very good, and 
the compositions on musical themes excellent. The elementary science work is 
technical, but the history papers from the high school show careful work in that 
subject. American literature is the basis of some good illustrated language work 
from the grammar grades of National City. The State normal school at San Jose 
and the Cogswell Manual Training School at San Francisco show excellent results 
in manual training and related subjects. Mrs. Cooper sends some pretty nature 
studies in water colors and some interesting spontaneous drawings, and the Sil- 
ver Street Kindergarten an excellent series of drawing, illustrating ‘“‘Seven Little 
Sisters.” The Leland Stanford Junior University and the University of California 
exhibit photographs of their buildings. The statistical charts from the different 
counties give a good deal of important data, and there are many relief maps from 
California, some of them good and many of them bad. The district schools of Cali- 
fornia make a better showing than the city schools. 
The children of Oregon paid for the State exhibit by penny collections. The Port- 
land high school sends the notebooks of the pupils in physics and chemistry. Rose- 
burg has some ingenious historical maps and some botanical work which is largely 
technical. Astoria aims to give language training by means of technical grammar, 
but the results are not flattering. Mental arithmetic is studied in the schools of 
Portland and at the Willamette University. ‘There is a good deal of map work from 
Oregon, but it is chiefly in outline. 
Washington has made a very pretty exhibit, and the three large cities—Seattle, 
Tacoma, and Spokane—have all sent their best work. It has a good place in the 
Washington State building and is artistically arranged. Form study is given great 
prominence in the Seattle exhibit. There is considerable work in reading and dia- 
critical marks. There is science work iu all the lower grades, and it is intelligently 
developed. The history papers from the eighth grade are good, and the zoology 
papers in the high school are neatly illustrated with pen drawings. The geography 
work would be stronger if so much energy had not been expended on the details of 
outline maps. Infinite prettiness is a fault of the map work at Tacoma, too. But 
Tacoma has some good object and physiological drawings, and. the language work 
above the primary grades is good. The high school work in geometry, physics, and 
chemistry shows strength. There are some neatly developed botany lessons, and the 
primary reading is better illustrated than the primary language. Spokane has not 
been outdone by Seattle and Tacoma in the display of good work. Her wood carving 
is the best from the Pacific Coast, to except, perhaps, that of the Cogswell Manual 
Training School. The language work is not strong, but the modeled fruits are quite 
natural and prettily colored. The model of the ship Santa Maria, by the pupils of 
the high school, is a splendid piece of work. The exhibit from Olympia is extensive, 
but it does not approach that of the three cities already named. The best county 
school exhibit from Washington is that of Whitman County. Pullman, Colfax, and 
several other of the smaller towns send a good deal of written work, and some of it 
is good.

  AMERICAN VIEWS OF THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. .493 
The Catholics of the United States, England, and France have made a very large 
educational exhibit—too large in quantity for purposes of study, the same lines of 
work being duplicated over and over. Needle and art work constitute a very large 
part of the exhibit. The former bears evidence of great skill, but the latter does 
not take high rank as art work, the works being too often copies and these stiff and 
mechanical. Most of the teaching orders of both men and women, representing 
every grade of instruction, exhibit their work, that of the Brothers of the Christian 
Schools and the Sisters of Notre Dame taking highest rank. If the blessed John 
Baptist de la Salle could know the widespread influence of his teachings, and the 
reverent consideration of his memory at this time, he would indeed realize that his 
great life work had not beenin vain. The Brothers of the Christian Schools exhibit 
some very good work, more especially in English. The altar constructed by the 
pupils of the St. Joseph’s Orphan Home, Columbus, Ohio, is a fine piece of work in 
manual training. St. Benedict Academy, Chicago, submits some excellent pen draw- 
ings, as does also the Institute of Our Lady at Longwood. For 13-year old boys, the 
plumbing sent by St. Francis Industrial School at Eddington, Pa., is very superior. 
It is interesting to find in the Catholic educational exhibit the introduction of 
elementary science in the lower grades. The St. James and the St. Stanislaus schools, 
Chicago, have done some creditable work in this line. In the exhibit of the Diocese 
of Covington, Ky., one finds a number of pieces of creditable water-color paintings. 
Some well-written compositions come from Manhattan College, New York, and the 
history charts made at the Ursuline Academy, Pittsburg, show considerable inge- 
nuity. The needlework throughout the Catholic exhibit is excellent; it is one of 
the strongest features of the exhibit. The garments from the Colored Industrial 
Institute, Pine Bluff, Ark., are well made. Rock Hill College, Maryland, makes an 
interesting collection of woods, and the schools of Philadelphia show good wood 
carvings. 
Manual training is a prominent feature of every department of the world’s educa- 
tional exhibits. From kindergarten to college, inclusive, one finds this new form of 
mental training. Tool instruction, including carpentry, pattern making, wood turn- 
ing and carving, forge work, and domestic science, take their rank with language, 
history, mathematics, and the other subjects of intellectual development and disci- 
pline. Most of the cities have exhibited their manual training in connection with 
their other lines; but a few, including several private schools, have made separate 
exhibits. These wili be considered here. The Chieago Manual Training School makes 
one of the best exhibits. Its work, like that of Pratt Institute, is uniformly excel- 
lent. Some of the original sketches, as well as the work in perspective and shadows, 
approaches the standard of the best art schools. There is also good work in wood 
and iron. The Toledo Manual Training School exhibits the work of girls as well as 
of boys, and the girls in some instances show greater skill than the boys. The tools 
used by the pupils are tempered by themselves. Some good wood carving comes 
from this school and the cookbooks exhibited are interesting. The St. Louis Manual 
Training School exhibits joinery and wood turning from the first year; forging, pat- 
tern making, and molding from the second year; and machine work from the third 
year. All this work, as well as the accompanying drawings, takes high rank. The 
Baltimore Manual Training School has work in wood, brass, iron, and tin, as well as 
outline maps and water colors. The Technical School of Cincinnati has some free- 
hand drawings with pen and some illustrated papers in American literature that 
compare favorably with the best high school work. The New York Trade School 
exhibits its work in plumbing, stonecutting, sign painting, job printing, and enamel 
gilding. The Jewish Trade School, Chicago, has work in wood, clay, and cloth, but 
it is not as strong as that in the schools mentioned above. J. Liberty Tadd, of 
Philadelphia, illustrates his method of drawing and manual training for psycholog- 
ical and physiological development. These large manual training exhibits—and 
most of them from free schools—show how fully skill in handicraft is appreciated by

the people; and all this appreciation and development has taken place since the 
world’s educational exhibits at Philadelphia in 1876. 
X. The education of defective classes is now claiming its share of attention, and 
the State is recognizing that the deaf and blind and feeble-minded haye claims upon 
it for training not to be exceeded by the claims of normal children. The exhibits 
which these three classes make at Chicago have special interest for the students of 
education, since the methods employed in teaching defective classes admit of better 
representation than the methods employed in teaching normal children. Twenty- 
five schools are represented in the collective exhibit of institutions for the education 
of the deaf. These for the most part are State institutions. The National College 
at Washington, the only higher institution for the deaf in the world, has a good dis- 
play of photographs. The woodwork from Michigan is among the best. All of 
these schools employ manual training methods, chiefly for the purpose of teaching 
trades. The finished products in the way of bookcases, shoes, harness, and needle- 
work show great skill on the part of these students. Most of the schools for the 
deaf combine the manual with the oral method; although it is evident that the oral 
method is in the ascendancy and the day is not distant when all these institutions 
will teach the deaf to talk and to read lips. The MeCowen Oral School, Chicago, 
shows some good results in this departure. Its pupils range in age from 4 to 13, 
and they not only use the voice well, but the work exhibited in elementary science, 
sloid, drawing, and kindergarten, compares favorably with the best primary schools 
for hearing children. The Home for the Training in Speech for Deaf Children, 
Philadelphia, sent 20 children, ranging in age from 4 to 7, to Chicago, during the 
Exposition. It is the purpose of this school to prepare deaf children for the public 
schools and present results fully justify the expectation. The Volta Bureau at 
Washington exhibits 75 volumes of its publications which are valuable contribu- 
tions to educational literature. This bureau, through the munificence of Alexander 
Graham Bell, is doing a great and good work in promoting the teaching of speech 
to the deaf. 
Nine State institutions for the education of the blind exhibit collectively. These 
schools, like those for the deaf, aim not only to give academical instruction, but to 
teach useful trades. For many years broom making constituted the chief line of 
industrial work, but it is pleasant to note that piano tuning and other higher forms 
of mechanical work have been opened up to the blind. Illinois makes a good exhibit 
in sloid and hammock making; Colorado, in kindergarten work; Pennsylvania, the 
largest of the State exhibits, in language and geography; Wisconsin, in clay model- 
ing and domestic economy; Indiana, in carpet weaving and chair caning. The Per- 
kins Institution, the oldest * * * of these institutions, has a fine display of 
kindergarten and sloid work. Most of these schools begin with kindergarten 
methods, and music and industrial work receive considerable attention. 
Institutions for the education of feeble-minded children have brought relief to 
thousands of afflicted families all over the country; and 13 of these schools (11 State 
and 2 private) exhibit at Chicago. Of the defective classes, the feeble-minded are 
the least susceptible to education; and yet the drawings, compositions, maps, needle- 
work, and carvings show great possibilities for even the imbecile classes. The eth- 
nological charts regarding feeble-minded children in the school at Elwyn, Pa., are 
remarkably suggestive, as are also the photographs and studies of family types from 
the school at Faribault, Minn. Indiana has some neat china painting and a cherry 
cabinet that is well made; California, wood carving; Kentucky, mattresses; Iowa, 
shoes and inlaid woodwork; New Jersey, hammocks; Minnesota, repoussé work; 
Pennsylvania, torchon lace; Massachusetts, number work that is remarkable for 
children who have been in school but one year; and Connecticut has some kinder- 
garten work that would do credit to the pupils of a sane school. These schools are 
doing a splendid educational work for hundreds capable of improvement, as well as 
providing care and comfort for such as can not be improved.

XI. The schools for the education of dependent and criminal classes exhibit in 
the Anthropological Building. The South End Industrial School, Boston, in which 
Edward Everett Hale has been so much interested, displays its lines of sewing, 
sloid, and drawing. Various aid societics and fresh-air societies exhibit by photo- 
graphs and charts. The Boston Children’s Aid Society fully illustrates its home 
library feature—an admirable feature, by the way—of this educational work for 
dependent children. The Hebrew Technical School, New York, to which Felix 
Adler has given so much intelligent support, has some very good wood carvings, 
and some creditable notebooks and pieces of physical apparatus are displayed. 
Caring for dependent children is not new in this country; but giving this care an 
educational bias is. So that a meager display from these schools is not to be won- 
dered at. 
The schools for reformatory or criminal classes exhibit pretty generally. * * * 
The illustrated work in language and elementary science of the Lyman School for 
boys at Westboro, Mass., certainly shows that the methods employed in teaching 
are modern, and there is some good designing in colored papers, and some good 
pieces of wood carving. The New York Industrial School at. Rochester makes the 
largest exhibit. Along lines in which trades are taught—domestic economy, shoe- 
making, carpentry, etc.—the work exhibited is of a high grade; but along the 
purely literary lines it is much below that of the Lyman School. Some of the grain- 
ing in wood is excellent, and the display includes an excellent model of the laundry 
made by the pupils. The Illinois school of agriculture and manual training for boys, 
at Glenwood, does well in its wood carving and written work. The New York House 
of Refugo at Randall’s Island, which provides for the instruction and care of the 
juvenile offenders of New York and Kings counties, has some creditable objective 
work. The Pennsylvania Reform School at Morganza has a good deal of map work 
and the Girl’s Industrial Home at Delaware, Ohio, a good deal of sewing. 
The negro is well represented in the educational exhibit, not only in the State 
exhibits but in the special exhibits. Hampton Institute, Virginia, makes the best 
showing in regard to both negroes and Indians. The work throughout is praise- 
worthy when one considers tho limited means of this institution and the great num- 
bers that it yearly instructs. One of the purposes of this school is to teach the red 
man and the colored man useful trades—printing, blacksmithing, wheelwrighting, 
shoemaking, and tailoring, and the finished articles exhibited are uniformly well 
done. Many of the teachers in the colored schools of the South are trained at 
Hampton, and an interesting feature of the exhibit is the work of the normal 
classes. In the collective educational exhibit of the Freedman’s Aid Society, three 
institutions are represented by school work—Claflin University at Orangeburg, 
S. C.; Clark University, Atlanta, Ga.; and Central Tennessee College at Nashville. 
These schools are not, as their names would indicate, higher institutions of learning, 
but, chiefly, schools of primary and secondary grade. The pupils represented range 
in age from 6 to 30 years, and the subjects include primary number, language, read- 
ing, the sciences, pharmacy, biology, and theology. Atlanta University, Georgia, 
and Wilberforce University, Ohio, each make separate exhibits. Both cover a wide 
range of subjects with emphasis on the manual training both for purposes of trades 
and development of skill. 
The Carlisle Indian School, Pennsylvania, exhibits in the Liberal Arts Building, 
and 52 other schools in the United States Indian Building. The work from Carlisle 
is certainly good, due in part to the fact that it is one of the oldest, but chiefly 
because it has enjoyed the continuous superintendence of Captain Pratt. Drawing 
and music form a part of this exhibit; and the language papers, if not always ele- 
gant, are always interesting. The garments made and the wagons built by these 
Indian girls and boys are surprisingly meritorious. Fifty-two of the Government 
Indian schools exhibit collectively. The best work from Genoa, Nebr., is in print- 
ing and harness making; Rensselaer, Ind., blacksmithing; Fort Yuma, Cal., two    
-P-A-G-E-506
  496 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
models of schoolhouses; Green Bay Agency, Wis., written work; Grand Junction, 
Colo., and Albuquerque, N. Mex., letter writing; Pima Agency, Ariz., penmanship; 
Klamath, Oreg., colored drawings; and Chilocco, Okla., illustrated language. Dur- 
ing the Exposition 7 schools have, at different periods, held forth with 30 pupils 
each, and illustrated their methods by actual teaching in the United States Indian 
School Building, where the school work of the Indian children is displayed. These 
schools have been from Albuquerque, N. Mex.; Rensselaer, Ind.; Lincoln, Nebr.; 
Lawrence, Kans.; Genoa, Nebr.; Chilocco, Okla., and Osage, Okla. The Indian 
school work from the Northwest Territories, which in some respects is better than 
our own, will be mentioned in connection with the account of the Canadian exhibit, 
of which it is a part. 
XII. Those who remember the excellence of the Canadian educational exhibit at the 
Philadelphia Centennial, 1876, are not a little disappointed with the present display 
at Chicago. It lacks plan in preparation, and is not well arranged; and, to except 
some work from Hamilton and Kingston, the Ontario exhibit—which should have 
been the best—is weak. The great city of Toronto, with its excellent public schools, 
is not represented ;, and an entire alcove, which should have been placed at the dis- 
posal of Inspector Hughes, is given over to so-called art colleges; and these display 
no strong, but many weak pictures. The best work in the Ontario exhibit comes 
from Hamilton; and the correlation of elementary science, language, and drawing is 
excellent. The drawing here is better than elsewhere in the Canadian Provinces, 
although their drawing in Canada is much inferior to our own. The primary work 
from Hamilton is the best. Milton and Kingston both exhibit labored designs, 
which are scarcely more than mediocre. They are for the most part copies, but 
weak at that. But the Kingston schools exhibit one line of strong work—vertical 
writing—from the third, fourth, and fifth grades. It is uniformly better than the 
oblique writing of corresponding grades in other schools. A great number of art: 
colleges exhibit water and oil paintings, charcoals, clay models, etc., but the work 
is very commonplace, The Institution for the Education of the Blind at Brantford 
exhibits some pieces of willow and cane work that are good, as well as some good 
sewing and kindergarten work. The Institution for the Education of the Deaf at 
Belleville, and that for the Education of Feeble Minded at Orillea, both show to 
what extent manual training is employed in giving skill to the deaf and the imbe- 
cile juveniles of Ontario. 
The Province of Quebee makes a fuller and in some respects a better exhibit than 
Ontario. The penmanship throughout is good, but the language teaching for the 
most part mechanical. Religious instruction, and this of a rather formal character, 
is emphasized in the written work. There are some fairly good drawings from 
objects from the Montreal Model School and the Layal Normal School. Typewrit- 
ing and stenography are important branches in the secondary schools of Canada. 
The classical colleges of Quebec make a full exhibit of their notebooks in English, 
French, Latin, and Greek. The Institution for the Education of the Deaf, in which 
the oral method is chiefly employed, shows good results in composition and language. 
The students in the blind institution do some good cane and needle work. <A great 
number of religious teaching orders exhibit from the Province of Quebec. ‘The 
Ursulines of Stanstead have a good deal of written work; the Sisters of the Good 
Shepherd, needle and china work; Clerics of St. Viator, pen drawing; Sisters of the 
Holy Cross, herbariums; Sisters of St. Anne, water colors, and Sisters of Jesus-Marie, 
copious notes on written work. The Institute of the Congregation of Notre Dame 
has the best school work of the religious orders. Their language and elementary 
science work have broader foundations and follow more closely scientific methods. 
A number of the male teaching orders make exhibits. The Brothers of the Chris- 
tians schools display some exercises in penmanship that look very like copper- 
plate. 
     
-P-A-G-E-507
  
AMERICAN VIEWS OF THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. A497 
Of the four Canadian Provinces exhibiting, that of Nova Scotia is the smallest. 
The provincial normal school at Truro has a number of drawings that are pretty, 
but most of them are copies. Halifax displays clay and kindergarten work, and 
one of the church schools for girls some water colors that are fair. There is a good 
educational map of Nova Scotia, showing the location of every schoolhouse in the 
Province. 
Considering their isolation, the Northwest Territories make an altogether credita- 
ble exhibit, and show that they are really trying to keep step with general progress. 
The language work from Regina is good; so are the reproductions from Whitewood. 
The most interesting feature of the exhibit is the work from Indian schools. The 
Northwest Territories are providing educational facilities for the offspring of the 
aborigines. The industrial work—printing, shoemaking, sewing, weaving, etv.—as 
well as the work in language and penmanship, compares favorably with the better 
Indian schools in the United States. Ten pupils from one of these schools, under 
the direction of the Gray Nuns, were brought to Chicago, and illustrate their methods 
of work. There are four of these industrial schools in the Northwest Territories, 
under the direction of Gray Nuns. 
XIII, The French colonies at Guadeloupe and Martinique, West Indies, and French 
Guiana, South America, made small and unimportant educational exhibits. The 
exercise books of the pupils of Martinique had been laboriously corrected by the 
teachers; and the exercises from the village schools-seemed better than those of the 
town schools. The best work from Guadeloupe was the fancy needlework. The 
work from French Guiana is interesting because it represents largely the children of 
convicts. The needle and feather work both were good, and there were some excel- 
lent pieces of penmanship from the school of the Sisters of St. Joseph. These schools 
exhibit in the French Colonies buildings. ‘ 
Mexico does not make an important exhibit, although in penmanship and pen 
drawing she is scarcely excelled. The school for the blind makes an exhibit of 
industrial work that is interesting. The pupils in the school at Pueblo exhibit their 
industrial work, chiefly in Mexican onyx, and the exhibit is pretty if not strictly 
educational. The pen portraits and penmanship throughout the exhibit are fine. 
But one would prefer to see handwriting no better than that of Horace Greeley 
and have training in thought development than have this fine writing with few 
evidences of training in intellectual power. The Mexican exhibit contains a pretty 
complete set of the text-books used in the schools. 
Besides the exhibit from French Guiana, three of the South American republics 
send school work—Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentine Republic. * * * Rio Janeiro 
occupies the best part of the space [devoted to Brazil] with exercise books, which 
show the subjects pursued in the schools. There is a good deal of drawing, but it 
is for the most part crude. The drawings with colored pencils seem better than the 
drawings in black and white, A large number of’ outline maps are exhibited. The 
great amount of work is mat weaving and colored papers indicates to what extent 
kindergarten methods are employed in the primary schools. Like Mexico, Brazil 
pupils excel in pen drawings. Maps, charts, and photographs form an important 
feature of the exhibit. The devotion of the Brazilians to their educational leaders 
is indicated by the fact that in the exhibit one finds a fine bust and an excellent por- 
trait of the first minister of public instruction, Sefior Benjamin Constant. 
The Republic of Uruguay makes a very good educational exhibit in the Agricul- 
tural Building. It includes not only a great deal of written work of the pupils, but 
as well samples of blackboards, desks, and other teaching appurtenances and appli- 
ances. The language exercises seem better than those in the Brazilian schools, and 
the penmanship throughout is excellent. There is scarcely any work submitted in 
drawing, to except outline maps, and these are good. Full sets of photographs illus- 
trate the students at work in the normal school. The Pedagogical Museum and 
Library at-Montevideo is doing a great and good work for the professional training, 
ED 93——32   
 
-P-A-G-E-508

of teachers, and Dr. Ruano, who has been the moving spirit in this—and at present 
its director—accompanied the exhibit to Chicago. Among the models exhibited by 
this museum was one of a rural schoolhouse at Baftado, with a photograph of the 
tule structure which it supplanted. In all, the Uruguay exhibit contains nearly 
“eight hundred pieces of school work. 
Had the Argentine Republic been given proper space her educational exhibit 
would have doubtless made by far the best showing from South America; but it was 
crowded into one sinall, dark alcove on the ground floor of the Manufactures Build- 
ing, and much of it could not even be unpacked for the want of space. Sefior Carlos 
Gallardo, who was in charge, made the best of this bad management on the part of 
the Exposition authorities, and did all in his power to unpack and place in view the 
work from his schools whenever those sufficiently interested in the matter asked to 
see the school work from his country. But his space was'so very meager that only 
a very small part of the work could be unpacked at any one time. Like Uruguay, * 
the Argentine Republic sent samples of the desks used in the schools. There were 
also full sets of reports of the department of education, as well as files of the educa- 
tional journals, and these neatly bound. Another feature of the exhibit was the dis- 
play of professional books—those which the teachers are required to read—and not 
a few of these were translations from American pedagogical writers—Drs. Harris, 
Hailmann, Calkins, Sheldon, ete. At least a half dozen of the International Eduea- 
tional Series, edited by Dr. Harris and published by the Appletons, have been trans- 
lated for the use of the Argentine teachers. It is evident from the exhibit that this 
country has taken hold of the normal school problem with great earnestness and 
intelligence. The manual training problem is also being solved, as well as the kin- 
dergarten problem, and both are represented in the exhibit. Natural history as the 
basis of language work, so new even in the United States, already has some advo- 
cates in the Argentine Republic, and the papers and drawings submitted are not 
poor. The relief maps are certainly better than those made by the pupils in the 
German schools, or in most schools in North America. Writing from pictures is a 
means of language teaching in many of the schools. The National College of Argen- 
tine, the normal schools, the orphan schools, and the night schools all show their 
distinctive lines by means of exercise books, maps, and photographs. 
XIV. Two words characterize the Swedish educational exhibit, sleid and gym- 
nasties. And yet when one studies the programmes of the Swedish schools he finds 
that in the former from two to six hours a week are given, and in the latter even 
less. Sweden made her educational exhibit in her own buildings; it was not exten- 
sive or varied, but it contained some lines that were interesting and unusual. Sloid 
work from every grade of school shows to what extent this form of manual training 
is utilized as a means of developing the mental and the physical powers of the child. 
It is encouraging to note in this exhibit that drawing is becoming more and more 
an adjunct of sloid. The embossed and engraved metal work, as well as the wood 
carvings, from the technical schools, show skill and art instinct. The architectural | 
drawings, too, ate good, and there are a great number of pictorial charts used in 
teaching geography. Text-books used in the schools and models of buildings for 
school purposes add to the value of the exhibit. The large display of home sloid 
indicates to what extent this handiwork is touching the fathers and the mothers 
as well as the children of Sweden. The school in weaving at Norrképing makes 
a highly creditable display of rugs, mats, portieres, etc., and the model of the Royal 
Gymnasium for Teachers gives an excellent idea of the equipment of these institu- 
tions. The Upsala University exhibits only a few rock sections used for petrological 
examination. The strongest feature of the Swedish exhibit is the system of teach- 
ing sloid to girls, under the direction of Miss Hulda Lundin. The work exhibited 
is done by girls ranging in age from 7 to 14 years, and the time devoted to this work 
is two hours a week in the first grade; four hours in the second, third, and fourth 
grades; five hours in the fifth and sixth grades, and six hours in the seventh grade. 
 
-P-A-G-E-509
  AMERICAN VIEWS OF THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 499 
The course includes plain knitting, purl and stocking knitting, patching, darning, 
and garment making. Throughout the sewing work the girls are taught to take 
measurements and to make patterns, The exercises are progressive, and the gar- 
ments made testify to the value of the method. Miss Lundin has two objects in 
view in her girls’ sloid—to make it an educational medium, and to fit the girls for 
practical life; and it would seem from her exhibit of the Stockholm work that she is 
succeeding admirably. 
The British Islanders are represented only by the London board schools. This 
exhibit is a large and in some respects an important one. It has three strong fea-- 
tures—the vertical writing, the designing in colored papers, and the laundry work. 
London has taken hold of the penmanship problem with great earnestness, and; in the 
opinion of the author, she has solved it very satisfactorily by the adoption of vertical 
writing. There is something harmonious, and to the eye satisfying, about the 
designing of these schools in colored papers. The colors harmonize, and the forms 
impress, as so mueh similar work from the schools of the American States do not. 
In London, laundry work is added to the course in manual training. Thereis a 
good deal of wood carving and modeling, and some of it is excellent. The weaving 
of baskets and mats with willow splints is another form of manual training that 
one does not find in other exhibits. A feature of the London board school exhibit 
that strikes the American as a trifle antiquated is the great number and variety of 
medals and rewards of merit given for excellence in scholarship, punctuality, and 
good conduct. A number of cabinets illustrating the aids used in teaching elemen- 
tary science are exhibited. 
XV. Germany sent the largest foreign educational exhibitto Chicago. It included 
every grade of school work, and was as complex in character as only Germany could 
have made it. In the matter of teaching appliances, Germany’s exhibit exceeded 
all the others combined; but a good deal of this apparatus was of a markedly 
mechanical style. A German teacher, for instance, works out a series of plant les- 
sons with his own class. The children study the plants and draw them from nature. 
The idea is a capital one, and said German teacher forthwith issues a long series of 
eharts—plates of his own drawings. These are to be used by other teachers; these 
pictures studied; these drawings copied; the spirit and method of the original * 
teacher lost in this complicated piece of apparatus. What is true of this series of 
plant lessons is true of a great amount of the appliances for teaching found in the 
German exhibit. The written work throughout, judged by mechanical standards, 
_ is excellent, but it lacks the spontaneity of similar work from the schools of the 
American States. The penmanship, the spelling, punctuation, and order of words 
is sometimes painfully uniform. One feature of the German exhibit that surprised 
the American inspeetor was the evident attention given to the secondary education 
ofwomen. The city high schools for girls (Héhere Miidchenschulen) made exceed- 
ingly creditable displays. The exercise books, the apparatus and text-books used, 
. the drawings and lines of industrial work all testified that the higher education of 
women was also being worked out in that country. Several models of school baths 
were novel features—novel to American teachers, at least—of the exhibit. The relief 
maps of the pupils, made of paper and pasteboard, as well as the product maps, 
were decidedly inferior to most of those exhibited by the United States. More and 
better helps for teaching geography were exhibited by Germany than any other 
country, but the pictures in the illustrated books were inferior- to our own. The 
manual training throughout was good, that from Berlin and Gérlitz being best. 
There was some wood carving by very young boys that showed great skill. 
The model showing the internal equipment of the King Frederick William Gym- 
nasium at Berlin was the best model exhibited, to except that of the Royal Gymnasium 
in Sweden. For some reason the work in English of the girls in the Héhere Miid- 
chenschulen was throughout better than that of the boys in the Real Gymnasium 
and Realschule. There was a good collection of pedagogical books exhibited, as well 
       
-P-A-G-E-510
  
  500 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
as busts of some great educators—Fichte, Luther, Rousseau, etal. The institutions 
for the education of deaf and blind and feebleminded all made large exhibits, illus- 
trating their methods and purpose. The universities of Germany, the strongest in 
the world, very fittingly stood most prominent in the exhibit. Every department 
of these higher institutions—physics, chemistry, mathematics, letters—was repre- 
sented by large collections. of teaching appliances and books. Even the swords 
(schliiger) used by the students were exhibited. One is deeply impressed with the 
weight of system in studying the German exhibit. The genius of the Yankee and 
the fine artistic sense of the French mind are nowhere apparent; but everywhere 
is to be found perfection of details, fidelity to order, and painstaking execution. 
In the matter of size the Russian educational exhibit ranked next to the German; 
and, like the German exhibit, it emphasized the machinery of a system rather than 
the actual results of the system. That the exhibit might be the better understood, 
the Russian department of education had printed and distributed a number of 
pamphlets in the English language, and these were of great value to the students of 
the exhibit. Schools for special classes, rather than schools for the masses, were 
represented in the Russian display. The deaf and dumb and blind, the foundling 
home, the orphan asylum, technical, art, and railway schools constituted the bulk of 
the work sent to Chicago. In the matter of manual training Russia yet leads the 
world, as was evidenced by the exhibits in woodwork from the pupils of the semi- 
nary for village teachers and the imperial schools for the deaf and dumb. The 
uniforms for the Cossacks, made by the pupilsin the institution for the education of 
orphans, and the needlework, from the imperial institutes for girls, showed unusual 
skill. Utility with them is doubtless emphasized more than with us; but the fact, 
nevertheless, remains true that Russia has more lessons in manual training to 
teach us. Some of the drawing and sketching from the Girls’ Gymnasium at 
Moscow was strong; but much of the art work from the Central School of Design 
was mediocre—too much of it being mere copy work. The drawing schools of the - 
Imperial Society for Promoting Art made a very full and very creditable exhibit of 
wood carving, bronze sculpturing, and China painting. There are in Russia rail- 
way schools and shipping schools and navigation schools, and these all exhibited. 
* It is not a matter of accident or apprenticeship that a man becomes a railway engl- 
neer in Russia; he must fit himself by a careful course of training in the railway 
schools provided by the Government. Perhaps the most interesting feature of the 
Russian display was the exhibit of the Pedagogic Museum, the largest in the world. 
In pedagogical books and pamphlets alone this museum has over 70,000 titles; and 
President G. Stanley Hall is authority for the statement that he saw a greater col- 
lection of teaching appliances there than he had seen anywhere else in the world. 
The exhibit of the Pedagogic Museum at Chicago consisted chiefly of apparatus of 
all sorts, from a soldier’s uniform down to anumeral frame. While the Russian edu- 
cational exhibit was large and varied and interesting, it was all too evident that 
popular education receives little attention, and that the big display represented the 
work of a few special and privileged schools. 
XVI. It is not too much to say that the educational exhibit from Egypt was a 
pleasant surprise to everyone who examined it. The work throughout seemed 
good, and all the different lines were well represented. The Arabie text-books, 
the slates, reed pens, and other teaching appliances, as well as the written work of 
the pupils, were displayed. The different editions of the Koran used in the various 
grades of schools were in the text-book exhibit. Manual training is given great 
prominence, and the inlaid woodwork was the best at Chicago. The notebooks of 
the students in physics, chemistry, and geometry were exhibited, and, as far as the 
writer could see, they equaled the work done in the better secondary schools in 
America, The modern languages are largely studied in the Egyptian schools, and 
the English compositions were exceedingly interesting. It was noted that when 
an Arabian youth was given a composition in Englisk to write he was always
-P-A-G-E-511
  AMERICAN VIEWS OF THE COLUMBIAN EXPosiTIon. 501 
given an English theme—a scene, an incident, a story with an English background. 
This may have been mere accident, but there is a principle underlying it that 
deserves the attention of modern-language teachers. The drawings from the 
Egyptian schools, especially the mechanical drawings, light and shade, were 
excellent. Whenever color was used in drawing it was well used. The drawings 
from life, of the secondary schools, were not as good as those from the French 
lycées, but they were better than those of our high schools. The polytechnic school 
at Cairo made a large and creditable exhibit of*work in wood and iron and mechan- 
ical drawing. There can be no doubt that France has exerted a most wholesome 
influence oyer the schools of Egypt, for the methods and lines of work are largely 
those of the French schools. 
A dozen or more towns about the Mediterranean in Europe, Asia, and Africa were 
represented in the educational exhibit of the Alliance Israelite Universelle. This 
organization is benevolent and not political in its aim; it seeks to provide educa- 
tional facilities to Jewish people in countries where they are still denied civil and 
religious liberty and to extend aid to those who suffer socially and politically by 
reason of their being Jews. Education is the sole work of the alliance, and its 
pupils are the children of the poor and ignorant. Among the cities exhibiting at 
Chicago were Tunis, Smyrna, Jerusalem, Yafa, Damascus, Constantinople, Bagdad, 
Salonica, and Adrianople; and a half dozen different languages—French, German, 
English, Hebrew, Arabic, and Greek—would be required to properly interpret the 
written work of these Jewish children. Manual training and agriculture are 
important subjects of study, the girls being taught housework and needlework and 
the boys tradesand farming. Many of these schools show great skill in handiwork, 
among the good pieces of work in the exhibit being a model wardrobe from Con- 
stantinople, bath tubs from Tunis, copper ware from Jerusalem, rugs from Damas- 
cus, harness from Smyrna, and shoes from Adrianople. Some of the illustrated 
language papers from the school at Smyrna are very creditable. The Yafa agricul- 
tural school has a large exhibit of oils, seeds, and wines. Some of the maps of 
these schools are so inaccurate as to be amusing, but on the whole the work is good. 
And when one recalls that over 13,000 poor children, who would otherwise receive 
no school training, are annually taught in these schools supported by benevolent 
Hebrews, the exhibit, even though it should be less meritorious than it is, would be 
entitled to praise. 
To except the Hebrew schools in western Asia, Japan is the only country of the 
Orient represented in the educational exhibit; but the Japanese have made a large 
and a good exhibit. The primary schools are represented by kindergarten work, 
clay modeling, and drawings; the secondary schools by the text-books and appa- 
ratus used, manual training, and written papers; the normal schools by photo- 
graphs, woodwork, and drawings from nature; and the musical, commercial, and 
agricultural schools each show their distinctive lines of work. One is impressed 
with the series and gradation of Japanese schools. There are a good many draw- 
ings from the different classes of schools, but more drawings from copies than one 
would expect. The color work throughout admirably illustrates the Japanese ideal. 
The free-hand drawings from both the girls’ and the boys’ high schools are good. 
The institutions for the education of the deaf and blind make a good showing 
in wood carving andembroidery. The ungraded schools have exhibited collectively 
their inaustrial work, chiefly garments. The English work in the higher institu- 
tions is interesting. A recently published book is selected, and the chapters are 
assigned to different members of the class for translation. The Japanese idea of 
English composition must be very large. One such composition examined by the 
writer contained 118 closely written pages of letter paper, and another 190 pages. 
The commercial schools at Kobe, Tokyo, and Kito exhibit full sets of account books. — 
The Imperial University is represented in the exhibit by its department of engineer- 
ing and harbor improvements. ‘The Educational Museum has an exhibit of models,

charts, and diagrams. A full set of the text-books, as well as the other school appa- 
ratus, are also exhibited. There can be no doubt but that Japan is doing much for 
all classes and grades of her children. 
Australia disappointed her friends in sending work from but one province, New 
South Wales, and this probably not the best. The best part of the exhibit was the 
work in vertical writing. Sydney, Singleton, West Maitland, and other towns 
clearly demonstrate the superiority of vertical over oblique penmanship. The lan- 
guage work e.hibited was largely technical; it lacked freedom and fullness. The 
drawing, to exeept the mechanical drawings from the technical schools, was of an 
inferior order. Much of it was done with pen and colored inks, and the combina- 
tions of colors in most instances were atrocious. In manual training the exhibit was 
strong, especially in garment making. Young girls in New South Wales do much 
better in their sewing than girls of equal age in the United States, France, and Eng- 
land. The Sydney Polytechnic College made by all odds the most creditable display 
from New South Wales. Its work in plumbing was unique, and it had some good. 
woodwork. The institutions for the education of the deaf and blind exhibited their 
industrial work. The New South Wales exhibit was not displayed to advantage. 
The written work was in glass cases, and these were only to be opened by attendants, 
who were seldom on hand to doit. The spirit of the Australian work exhibited was 
that of the English school, although the exhibit at Chicago was so much inferior to 
the London exhibit that it hardly deserves to be mentioned in the same connection. 
XVI. By an oversight, the West Virginia exhibit was not mentioned in discussing 
the work from the Middle States. This exhibit was neither large nor especially 
strong; but it presented very satisfactorily the educational activities of the State. 
Wheeling, Parkersburg, and Charleston sent most of the work. The collection of 
photographs was large, and these included not only exteriors of schoolhouses, but 
interiors and ground plans as well. There were some pieces of woodwork from the 
deaf and dumb asylum at Romney that showed skill in handiwork. <A chart illus- 
trative of the educational exhibit and a pen drawing of the State capitol attracted 
general attention. 
While the United States Furniture Company, the Prang Educational Company, the 
Milton Bradley Company, and the various book publishers * * * made full and 
satisfactory displays, with the exception of text and referenco books, there was a 
dearth of teaching appliances at the great Chicago Exposition. This was especially 
true of school furniture and the ordinary school apparatus. ‘True, some of the 
schools for teachers—as, for instance, the normal schools at Bridgewater and San 
Jose and the College for the Training of Teachers in New York City—had excellent 
displays of homemade apparatus; but the commercial exhibits were for the most 
partsmall. One little city in Minnesota (Stillwater) made an exhibit of one line of 
school apparatus (optical projections) that was paralleled only by the French exhibit. 
A real genius, Mr. Frank T. Wilson, has for some years directed the schools at Still- 
water, and he made at Chicago an exhibit of projection appliances that won for him 
and his city the approbation of the foreign and American critics. Mr. Wilson is one 
of the first to introduce and simplify this form of illustrative teaching in the New 
World, and his exhibit at Chicago was the inspiration and model of much that will 
be done in this line during the next decade. 
The workings and aims of the Bureau of Education were shown by Dr. Harris to 
great advantage, the only regret being that it was placed in the Government Build- 
ing instead of in the Building of Liberal Arts, but this was beyond Dr. Harris’s con- 
trol. When one surveyed the 21 volumes of annual reports of the Commissioner 
of Education—a veritable cyclopedia of education; the great number of special 
reports, the eighty-odd monographs on institutions, systems, and practices, and the 
50 miscellaneous publications—when one saw these together at Chicago and noted 
their contents and influence he could but reflect upon the wisdom of our National 
Government in establishing the Bureau. Henry Barnard planned wisely when he

   presented to the American Association for the Advancement of Education, in 1854, 
“A plan of central agency for the advancement of education in the United States.” 
Ancther feature of the exhibit of the Bureau of Education was the “ model library.” 
This contained a part of a selection of 5,230 volumes, made by a committee of 75 
librarians and specialists chosen by the American Library Association. The cata- 
logue of this “model library” will be very helpful in the formation of small city 
libraries. Surely the American teacher who studied the Bureau of Education’s 
exhibit had abundant occasion for professional: pride and gratitude to our National 
Gevernment for what it is doing to create for us an extended pedagogical literature.     
      
     
    
    WORLD’S FAIR EDUCATIONAL NOTES. 
By Mrs. JENNI: M. BRYAN, in Boston Journal of Education. 
     If the teachers of the country were not lacking in true professional spirit, would 
the southwest gallery of the Liberal Arts Building be so neglected? Would a sur- 
geon studiously avoid a display of instruments and appliances pertaining to his 
profession? ‘ 
There are schools and there are schools. The Boston schools and those of the back 
districts are not the pedagogical antipodes. It is a fact to be welcomed with glad 
acclamation that English is becoming a recognized branch of study, and is receiving 
as critical attention as has been bestowed for years upon Greek and Latin. 
The most pleasing, the most utilitarian product of an educational course is the 
ability to use the mother tongue well. This is alike necessary to the successful 
business man and to the society belle. A few of the best schools of the country, 
notably those of Boston, St. Paul, Minneapolis, Denver, and Indianapolis, have recog- 
nized the imperative need of a greater facility in the use of both spoken and written 
English, and also have been convinced of the really practical benefits to be derived 
from a better acquaintance with English literature. 
To this end they have formulated courses of study making language the founda- 
tion, the keystone, the ornamentation of the educational structure. This has been 
made possible in the lower grades by the unification of subjects. The child in his 
earliest school days is given a leaf, a flower, or an insect. He is led to examine it, 
talk about it, count its parts, write little sentences about it, and draw it. It fur- 
nishes material for reading, writing, spelling, arithmetic, and drawing. Having 
something to talk about in-which he is interested, under the teacher’s wise guidance, 
he talks about it freely and naturally. When he takes his pencil in hand it does 
the talking with scarcely more effort or less accuracy. This develops a little later 
into a broader course of nature study and literature. In the third, fourth, and fifth 
years the pupils examine plants, insects, and stones with a view to a more scientific 
knowledge; they record their observations and enliven and beautify their papers 
by means of well-executed drawings of the object and its parts. 
In their earliest school years, and on up, the senseless practice of learning to 
repeat memory gems has given place to the study of memory gems. y 
In explanation of this statement, let me call attention to two exhibits. Here is a 
set of fifteen or twenty papers on which are written, with labored nicety and much 
red-line elaboration, several memory gems. One copy of ‘The fiftieth birthday of 
Agassiz” differs from the other fifteen or twenty in no particular except in the name 
appended. But here is another set which presents a pleasing variety. There is a 
paraphrase of the poem by one pupil, a reproduction of it by another, an interesting 
sketch of the life of the naturalist by a third, and a no less simply childlike one 
of Longfellow by a fourth. But the best feature of it alll is the evidence that some 
pupils have gotten very near to the heart of the dear old nurse Nature, and have 
given expression to the keen sense of delight awakened by the poem in attempts at 
original illustration, One biographical sketch shows the Swiss home in the beauti-

ful Pays de Vaud; another Nature’s storybook is strewn over with cidelweiss and 
entitled Rhymes of the Universe. How delightful such study! It is not difficult to 
say which pupils will remember that poem, even to their fiftieth birthday. 
The work shown by a great majority of the schools proves beyond a doubt that 
drawing is not merely a pretty accomplishment, but something as useful and neces- 
sary almost as writing. From the child of 6, beginning with 2 and 2 are 4, on up to 
the high school pupil, every subject studied is illustrated if it will by any possibility 
admit of pictorial treatment. 
The entire absence of abstract arithmetic work in the first, second, and third years 
was a noticeable feature of a number of the best schools. There was no puzzling of 
the infantile mind with the abstraction 17—3—what ?—but it was, I have 17 marbles 
and lose 3, how many have I left? And there along with the statement was the pic- 
ture of 17 marbles owned, 3 marbles lost, and 14 marbles remaining. In the fourth 
year, and to some extent in the third, the transition was made to abstract work, but 
“whenever concrete was done, the solution of the problem was accompanied by a 
neatly executed picture demonstration. 
A school, nameless, presented a set of papers in United States history, giving 
answers to such questions as, ‘‘ Who discovered America?” ‘‘ Where was De Soto 
buried?” ‘When was Ohio admitted into the Union?” Simply a set of examina- 
tion papers, cold, dull, and dispiriting, benefiting more the maker of paper than 
anyone else. In gratifying contrast to this, was found a set of papers selected from 
the year’s work of one of the Chicago schools. Biographies of eminent men were 
embellished with portraits of the subjects and pictures of their homes; descriptions 
of battles were accompanied by well executed maps showing the positions of the 
contending armies; the recital of facts was made interesting by the-charm of inter- 
woyen bits of story and song; and pervading every paper was the suggestion that 
the pride and delight felt by the pupils in doing this work would grow, in time, into 
a pride and delight in exercising the rights of American citizenship. 
The schools of Denver, Colo., presented the most unique feature of the whole 
exhibit, namely, a stenographic report of everything said and done by both teachers 
and pupils for one day, throughout all the grades of one, presumably the best of her 
schools. It proved interesting reading, but showed nothing remarkable as to mat- 
ter or method. It did show, however, the ability of the teachers to control most 
admirably for one day at least, both tempers and tongues, and that, too, under most 
exasperating conditions, as witness the following: A boy, of course, was called upon 
to parse the verb in the sentence, ‘“‘Shepherd lead on.” Parsing: ‘Lead is a verb, 
transitive, because it expresses action done to an object; passive, indicative, present 
tense, progressive form.” An appreciative reader of the report had written in the 
margin “A gem.” 
The most beautiful exhibit came from Sidney, New South Wales. The writing 
looked like copy plate, but not the copy plate to which we are accustomed in which 
hair lines and shading mingle with a Rembrandt effect. It was either a verticle or 
backhand, the system beginning with the primary, and being maintained to the last 
grade. 3 
The first year writing showed vertical letters, very large, the writing spaces being 
about the width of the spaces between the lines of ordinary foolscap. This seemed 
to meet the requirements of the child, for there was a boldness and freedom about 
this first year’s writing that was truly refreshing after looking at the diminutive, 
cramped letters shown by other primary schools. The second year the spacing was 
diminished, and so on, until about the fourth year it conformed to the ordinary 
standard. The advantages claimed for this system are the ease with which it is 
learned, its beauty and legibility, its great rapidity, and its perfect adaptability to 
business requirements. 
The Indian schools of Haskell Institute, Kansas, and Soboba, Cal., were the most 
surprising in their results. The writing resembled very closely that of the Sidney 
 
-P-A-G-E-515

schools, being almost as beautiful. The illustrations were admirably executed, and 
the language had a genuinely original flavor. The work done by pupils after seven, 
fifteen or twenty months was in advance of that presented by any other school 
examined, and forced from my companion the question, “What do you think now of 
the doctrine of heredity ?” The age of pupils entering these schools is much in 
advance of the ordinary age limit, but is a period of five or six years added to a 
child’s age to offsét several generations of intellectual culture? ; 
The exhibit of the intermediate schools of Indianapolis was disappointing in that 
it presented sets of examination papers. The primary work was fine, showing the 
development of the plan of unification of subjects. The high school was excellent, 
particularly in the line of literature. The curriculum of the Indianapolis schools 
provides for a systematic study of the English language and its literature through- 
out the entire course. In the high school, Latin, Greek, French, and German are 
elective studies, but English is compulsory. As a result the pupils express them- 
selves with an ease, gracefulness, and power that would compel Bostonians to own 
them cousins germane, 
The craze for illustrated work reached its climax in the musical exhibit of one of 
the primary schools of New Jersey. The music portfolio was made of large sheets 
of manila paper, on each of which was written the words and air of a juvenile song. 
The music of ‘Twinkle, twinkle, little star” was indicated by a star on the appro- 
priate line or space, instead of anote. For “Dickery, dickery dock,” a “cute” little 
mouse balanced himself on a line or rested on space as the requirements demanded. 
So on through ‘‘Jack and Jill,” ‘‘ Busy Bees,” and ‘Here we sail,” the symbol used 
was a bucket, a bee, or a boat. 
It was a matter of surprise that so many schools showed work that to a casual 
observer looked beautiful and fair, but which upon examination failed to be either 
helpful or inspiring. The exhibit would be voluminous, handsomely bound, and 
placed to advantage. The writing would rank among the best shown, but the sub- 
ject-matter would be merely answers to lists of examination questions, the chief aim 
being to have each pupil represented in each branch. This is, of course, very grati- 
fying to Johnny’s mamma or Katy’s papa, who may wish to see their dear children’s 
papers at the great Fair, but to the teacher searching for ideas and methods it 
proved unfruitful soil. 
The deepest impression that remains is that those schools which have accepted 
the revelation that the soul of the child who comes to them is the soul of a man or 
woman, perfect in all its parts, yet waiting the kind, the wise, the gentle guidance 
of the teacher to develop the highest qualities of intellect and heart; and those 
schools which have made nature and literature the great media through which this 
is to be accomplished, are coming into the bright light of the educational noonday. 
CATHOLIC EDUCATION AT THE WORLD’S FAIR. 
By Joun J. O’SHEa. 
As the tree is to be judged by its fruit, in the words of the Divine Master, so the 
generous vine of Catholic education may be appraised, in a, measure, by the living 
proofs it modestly put before mankind in the noble Hall of Liberal Arts at the 
Columbian Exposition. Multitudinousand wonder-compelling as the various depart- 
ments of the Columbian Exposition are from many points of view, the array of 
examples of Catholic training here presented claims the palm over all. As an expo- 
sition of a system, it is the most striking in extent, in variety, in evidence of a mas- 
terly system of mental direction that ever yet was brought before the world’s notice. 
It dwarfs mto insignificance the displays of educational results made by any and. 
every institution in the country, universities, colleges, and training schools taken 
altogether. The mobilization of such an army of practical witnesses for superiority 
was in itself a peculiar task. It demanded a special and intimate knowledge of a 
   
-P-A-G-E-516
      506 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
system which may be described as werld-wide; it demanded a personality influen- 
tial enough and magnetic enough to secure the heartiest cooperation simultaneously 
in places separated by vast distances; it demanded one, moreover, endued with an 
indefatigable spirit of industry. The man was found in the person of Brother Mau- 
relian. He is the Von Moltke with whom the scheme of mobilization originated and 
by whom it was so splendidly carried out. * * * 
Recognizing the importance of being early in the field, Brother Maurelian made 
his application for space at the Exposition as soon as the directorate and committees 
were organized. Although he encountered much difficulty at the outset, he was met 
at length in a spirit which can not be too highly extolled. Thirty thousand feet of 
floor space, roughly speaking, was placed at his disposal, and the position which he 
was fortunate enough to secure is probably the finest in the great hall devoted to 
manufactures and the liberal arts. This space, large as it is, would not suffice fora 
tithe of the exhibition which could have been made had there been more time for 
preparation and a condition of unlimited space; and as a matter of fact it has not 
nearly sufficed for the great mass of materials forwarded to Brother Maurelian from 
the various dioceses which responded to his invitation. ‘He had asked for a space 
of 60,000 feet, anticipating the large amount of material which would be at his com- 
mand, but he could hardly have expected the directors to give more than they did 
under the circumstances. But the display he makes is imposing, extensive, splendid, 
and marvelously eloquent of the care, taste, industry, and energy of the whole soul 
of Catholic teaching. * * * 
Bearing in mind the fact that in the collection which has called forth this tribute 
of admiration, but the work of only a portion of the Catholic schools of 20 dioceses 
in the United States was shown, one might easily imagine what would have been 
the writer’s wonder had all the archdioceses, dioceses, and vicariates in the Union, 
numbering about 90, been represented in similar proportions. Perhaps it is better 
that the display is confined to its present dimensions. It conveys a deeply impres- 
sive lesson, whose effect might be minimized by being further protracted. It is the 
frailty of our nature to grow weary with the repetition even of excellent things 
when we have had enough to convince us of their undeniable worth. It is sufficient 
to say that, as it stands, tho Catholic educational exhibit is incomparably the great- 
est display of its kind ever made. 
The importance of putting such proofs of Catholic activity before the world at 
this particular epoch was at once perceived by all the hierarchy of the United 
States. Bishop Spalding, of Peoria, took an especial interest in the project from its 
inception. The unfortunate divergences of opinion amongst Catholics over ques- 
tions of school attendance and State help, perhaps, naturally led many outsiders to 
think that while internal disagreement reigned the real work of education might 
be to some extent neglected. To such mistaken people there could be no greater 
surprise than this revelation of Catholic activity. There have been no controver- 
sies to disturb the serenity of the managers of the public schools. With them 
everything Has gone on as smoothly as the current of the Schuylkill, and apparently 
assomnolently. * * * 
To the kindly cooperation of Dr. 8. H. Peabody, chief of the liberal arts depart- 
ment of the Exposition, the promoters of the Catholic educational exhibit owe 
mainly their success in having their display so extensive and effective as itis. To 
his aid they are indebted for the prominent site and ample space they have secured; 
and he, on his part, feels how largely this display has contributed toward making the 
World’s Fair an adequate exemplar of the active mental and mechanical progress 
of the age. In his little speech at the throwing open of the exhibit he warmly 
expressed his thanks, on behalf of the World’s Fair authorities, to all who had 
cooperated in the work. His surprise at the colossal results achieved in such a brief 
interval was by no means concealed, and the eulogy which he pronounced on the 
zeal of the whole Catholic teaching body in preparing the youth of the Catholic 
 
-P-A-G-E-517
  AMERICAN VIEWS OF THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 507 
populations for the practical work of existence was the genuine expression of a 
proad and liberal mind. In this marvelous array of proofs he beheld a signal refu- 
tation of the widespread calumny that the tendency of Catholic education is to 
dwarf the scope and limit the faculties of the human mind. But he saw only one 
side of the picture. This was but the practical side of the Catholic system which 
he was beholding. Behind that mass of work of hand and brain lies the invisible 
sleepless activity which, while training the physical faculties, keeps ever leading on 
the moral ones to a clearer conception of the truth that there is a higher goal to be 
reached by the intelligence than the conquest of earthly knowledge, and that the 
sum of human perfection must have its final complement in the display which shall 
merit the everlasting award of the Judge who sits on high. This is what is meant by 
the twofold work of Catholic education. * * * 
In the arrangement.of the mass of material placed at his command Brother Mau- 
relian has exhibited a masterly ingenuity. By a simple device he has managed to 
double the ground space, so to speak, By running a desk around each of the com- 
partments, into which the exhibit is divided, he has been enabled to supplement his 
wall surface so that none of his space shall be wasted. Sufficient room is given for 
the visitor to walk all through the compartments and examine the work spread out 
upon the desks and hanging on the walls. The finer and more frangible objects are 
displayed in high glass cases standing in the center of each compartment. 
What is here made manifest may be divided into two branches: the methods of 
teaching and their practical application by those taught. Take, for instance, a speci- 
men of work from the De La Salle Institute in New York. It is the engineer’s plan 
for a great iron brid Here you see the notes taken by the pupil from the teacher's * 
instructions. Then you see the plan and the elevation drawn in regular artistic 
fashion. The dimensions are given; then the details down to the last bolt; then the 
estimate of the cost of the whole work. There is no particular missing; the plan 
» might be at once put into a contractor’s hands, and he would have no difficulty in 
setting to work to make the suppositious structure a substantial reality. So in 
astronomy, so in music, so in mechanics of many kinds. The system is lucidly 
demonstrated in the intelligent action of mind upon mind. 
Twenty dioceses of the United Sfates invite examination of their educational 
methods.: The Canadians haye an independent exposition of their own, of which a 
word later on. The American dioceses stand in the folowing alphabetical order: 
Brooklyn, Buffalo, Chicago, Cleveland, Covington, Denver, Detroit, Dubuque, 
Fort Wayne, Green Bay, La Crosse, Manchester, Milwaukee, Natchez, New Orleans, 
New York, Pittsburg, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Sioux Falls.

  508 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  Individual exhibits are shown also by the Catholic University of America, Wash- 
ington, D. C.; the Catholic Archives of America, from Notre Dame University, Indiana; 
the Catholic Total Abstinence Union of America, represented by its Temperance 
Publication Bureau; the Catholic text-books; the Columbian Library of Catholic 
Authors; the League of the Sacred Heart; Miss M. G. Caldwell (first foundress of 
- the Catliolic University), embroidery; Miss M. L. Ash’s art school, Memphis, Tenn. ; 
the Papal Josephinum College, of Columbus, Ohio, and the University of Notre Dame, 
Indiana. 
A glance at the artistic features of the general exhibit reveals some work which 
challenges attention, not from its mere abundance, which is great, but from its 
general excellence. Some of it is simply splendid. The place of honor is properly 
given to the Chicago exhibit, and the chef d’euvre in this is, according to strict 
definition, perhaps, a school show piece. It is a white Carrara marble statue of 
Archbishop Feehan, with the figure of a couple of school children at his feet. The 
work is full of grace, dignity, and life, and tells its own story as eloquently as any 
marble composition can; and all the cunning of the modern Italian school of sculp- 
ture is exemplified in its treatment. It is the work of a Roman artist, and its cost 
was $15,000. The priests of Archbishop Feehan’s diocese subscribed the sum as an 
affectionate recognition of his claim to be regarded as the “protector of their 
schools,” a distinction which he undoubtedly deserves. Gregori’s fine portraits of a 
large number of the American Catholic hierarchy, which are found in the collection 
sent by Notre Dame University, as well as the portraits of Archbishop Riordan and 
Bishop Spalding, which are apart, may also be excluded from the list of educational 
‘exhibits, in a similar sense. But besides these there is a great body of artistic work, 
in oil, in water color, in crayon,;in india ink, and in pencil, which furnishes a means 
of judging what advance we are making in this important branch of education 
There is no one so weak as to believe that America has achieved the first rank in 
art, but every honest critic believes that earnest effort is being made to attain to 
excellence. Artists do not spring out of the ground like the fabled men and women 
of Deucalion and Pyrrha’s time. Genius is not to be compelled; in due time, no 
doubt, it will visit the American shore and found a true school of art here. It is not 
claimed for any of the schools whose art teaching is here exhibited that they have 
reached the highest level attainable. There is a great inequality observable in the 
mass; there are cases of bad drawing and inharmonious and slovenly coloring; but 
there is work that is really true and good, and some that of its kind is positively 
beautiful. This is true especially of the specimens of illuminated work executed by 
the pupils at the Sacred Heart Convent in San Francisco. The collection of work 
shown by the Sisters of Mercy of that city is also remarkable for its excellence. 
Some admirable work in crayons and water colors is presented by the pupils of Miss 
Starr’s preparatory fine-art classes. The steel engravings from the Catholic high 
school of Philadelphia, founded by Thomas Cahill, are especially fine, and a corre- 
sponding level of excellence is noticeable in the examples of drawing and painting 
and embroidery turned out by the same institution. 
Numerous examples of oil painting are shown in different sections of the exhibit; 
and of these a very crotchety critic observed in one of the daily papers that the 
only good end they serve is to show the worthlessness of the teaching. Criticism of 
this kind is not worth answering. These pictures are not put there as pictures in 
an art gallery are. They are there neither for competition nor sale. They are put 
there simply to show what progress the young art students are making in the very 
difficult technique of color, which many eminent artists have vainly spent their 
lives in trying to master, and which no degree of excellence in line drawing could 
ever help some to gain. 
It would be just as reasonable to take exception to the occasional blunders in 
spelling, or the faulty compositions which are found occurring here and there in the 
class papers of the pupils. Surely no one would expect perfection from those who
-P-A-G-E-519

are in the state of tutelage. The whole school system, so far as it applies to the 
training of the mental and physical faculties, is laid bare to the world’s inspection, 
with all the imperfections of juvenile human nature on its head; and there never 
was a creature more out of his element in such an exhibition than the professional 
art critic, the individual, as a rule, who has failed in everything himself. 
Even Mr. Sneerwell would find it hard to get ground for cavil in the beautiful 
specimens of work shown by the pupils of the Christian Brothers’ schools in Paris. 
It is full of art workmanship in many branches, all of marvelously fine execution 
for boys, and the specimens of drawing and engraving are of a remarkably high 
order for juveniles. The French claim to be at the head of the list of all things 
educational, and no one can say that the challenge which they give out at the 
World’s Fair will be readily taken up. 
In the Canadian exhibit some noteworthy features are presented. The display 
made by the Catholic schools of Quebec covers 1,700 square feet of floor, while the 
showing of the Protestant schools from the same Province fits in a nook measuring 
175 square feet. ‘The Protestant Province of Ontario, on the other hand, sends from 
a total of 5,878 schools an aggregate of 375 exhibits; while the Catholics of the 
same Province send from a total of only 289 schools no fewer than 234 exhibits. The 
quality of the artistic work sent forward by the Catholic schools is vastly superior 
to that of the other schools of the Dominion which have sent specimens of their 
products. There are some aspects of the Dominion display which make it compare 
favorably with that of any of the other countries represented. The show of her- 
baria, for instance, in which specimens of the multitudinous wild flowers of Canada 
are collected and arranged with exquisite harmony of arrangement, is especially 
impressive. The fine sense of fitness in association and taste in grouping and 
artistic form seen in these numerous collections is at once felt and confessed. In 
the work of the brush, the crayon, and the pencil, too, Young Canada need not have 
any trepidation about competing for honors. Some traceeof the French genius is 
visible throughout the display from the Province of Quebec. 
It is not a matter for deep wonder that this display exhibits a superiority. * * * 
The minority in any locality in Quebec is entitled to its pro rata of the public taxes 
levied for educational purposes, to be applied in accordance with the views of the 
minority. This in effect leads in that Province to the denominational rule in edu- 
cation. As the Catholics are greatly in the majority in Quebec, they receive the 
maximum of the public taxes, and are thus enabled to secure the very best teaching 
appliances that money can obtain. The teaching power they already’ possess in 
plenty within their own religious and semireligious bodies. 
In the various kinds of handicraft shown here, the work of American boys in the 
more practical and everyday classes of production need not fear comparison with 
that of any others. Especially fine examples are sent in from the Catholic Protectory 
of New York, for boys and girls, and the great trade school on Staten Island. 
Teaching those who are in possession of every natural faculty is in many cases no 
easy matter: but the instruction of that unhappy section of the human family who 
come into the world without sight,or hearing or power of speech, or become so after 
their coming, must be regarded as the perfection of the teachers’ skill, It was with 
Catholic teachers that the idea of educating these maimed intellects began, and by 
them in France and Italy and Ireland that it is carried on mostly at present, with 
results that on consideration seem perfectly astounding. The cultivation of litera- 
ture, music, and the fine arts, as well as many mechanical industries, by the blind 
and the deaf and the dumb demands specially qualified teachers; and to the furnish- 
ing of these the religious orders now devote constant and most earnest attention. 
‘The specimens of work sent in by the Catholic Protectory pupils of this class deserve 
more than a passing notice. There are some very beautiful specimens of lace shown 
in the Canadian exhibit, the finest being the work of a girl of 13 who is totally blind. 
The instructresses of these Canadian blind girls are the good sisters known as the 
Gray Nuns.  
-P-A-G-E-520
    510 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Marvelously fine work is also shown by the Ephpheta School, of Chicago, in an 
vastonishingly varied field. Engraving, lithographing, photography, designing for 
carpets and wall paper, and many other decorative branches of industry are taught, 
it will be seen, most suecessfully in this admirable institution. 
To many the attractions of the kindergarten display made here will prove supe- 
rior to any other, as that system has now come to be regarded as the summum bonum 
in the educational field. Here is a bright and picturesque array of proofs how 
readily the little mind can be developed into the big one, as its powers are one by one 
awakened and appealed to in the course of its school-play years. The little picto- 
rial efforts, and the efforts in tiny handicraft, show that the shepherd boy who began 
drawing his sheep upon a slate and the builder of miniature fortresses in the mud 
or the sand by the seashore were most likely in reality the originators of the idea 
which Froebel and his successors took up and translated into action. 
It is only the preparatory stage in literature and art, it must be remembered, which 
this exhibit contemplated as coming within its scope. ‘he fact that there are con- 
tained in it illustrations of the higher education in both of these walks of civiliza- 
tion serves only to show, perhaps, the nakedness of our land in that respect. The 
higher education, as an institution, for American Catholics isa thing of possibilities; 
how immensely they are handicapped in that direction may be learned from a com- 
parison of the other educational exhibits with theirs. All that the public and pri- 
vate generosity of a great people could do has been done for the men and women of 
other creeds here; all that has been done for the Catholics has been done out of their 
own resources. The Columbian Library of Catholic Authors is a collection of no 
small interest and value as testifying that in the higher education Catholic names 
are not by any means unknown, even here; and the women’s department in this col- 
lection is not the least interesting portion of it. The fine exhibition from the Catho- 
lie University of Notre Dame, Indiana, gives an excellent idea of the present state of 
scholastic life in that institution and the high plane of its studies and scientific 
pursuits. The American Catholic Historical Society deserves a word of praise for 
the flood of light it lets in on the past of the struggling church on this continent by 
its rich archeological collection of ecclesiastical, artistic, and literary work, 
To the collection of these objects made by Professor Edwards of Notre Dame, Indi- 
ana, the palm of merit in this department must be given. He has got together a. 
perfect storehouse of precious ecclesiastical relics. They tell a wonderful tale in 
their way, these mitres and croziers and vestments, tarnished with age; these missals 
and breviaries and calf-bound volumes whose pages are yellow-gray as the face of a 
Pema yes 
Many things are taught by this exhibit. We are lifted up in thought as we wander 
through its varied mazes from the contemplation of the wisdom and the care mani- 
fested in the details of the system to the nobility of the purpose; and we see under- 
lying it all the sublime tenacity with which the Catholic Church goes on in her 
beneficent way. Through good report and evil report she adheres to her mission, 
whether states or Governments frown upon her or smile. She will not neglect her 
own; no matter who despises them, but like a tender mother and guide still helps 
them onward in the world, upward toward the light. 
THE CATHOLIC SCHOOL EXHIBIT.« 
[From The Catholic World.] 
By a PROFESSOR IN PEDAGOGY. 
To the intelligent observer the Catholic school exhibit, lately held in Central Palace 
Hall, New York City, is an event of more than passing interest. ‘To quote the words 
of his grace the most reverend archbishop of New York, we may say that— 
“Tt is not necessary to say that our schools are improving. It would be a miracle 
if they did not improve. 
1 Though this report refers to an exhibition held in New York, it is here inserted because most of 
the objects there exposed to the view had also been exhibited in Chicago.
-P-A-G-E-521
  AMERICAN VIEWS OF THE COLUMBIAN Exposition. 511 
“Tn this age, when so much attention is paid to the subject of education—I do not 
refer to religious training, which has a paramount importance in all our institutions; 
Ispeak rather in regard tosecular education at the present time—when the very best 
methods of teaching are the object of constant thought, when the best educators are 
devising new ones, and all means are suggested that can be of use in this work, it 
would be next to impossible to move in such an atmosphere and not to take advan- 
tage of all the benefits that accrue therefrom. And if we add to this the zeal of our 
brothers and sisters, and the great attention our pastors give Christian education in 
our schools, we shall understand at once that necessarily progress is made from day 
to day.” 
We had ‘already examined much of this display at the Columbian Exposition in 
Chicago; but, as stated by his grace the most reverend archbishop: “It was intended 
to have had the exhibition before this; but after the exhibits came back from that 
great city, where they had been exposed to the dust for several months, and as the 
books had been handled in many cases by thousands of visitors, it was deemed 
advisable to supplement all by new work especially prepared, as during that time a 
certain amount of experience had been acquired, and the children themselves were 
spurred on, by the many awards given by impartial juries for their work, to do some- 
thing better and brighter.” It was, therefore, with real satisfaction that we renewed 
our acquaintance with much that this exhibit offers, while we gladly admit that a 
considerable addition of really deserving work is found in this second exhibition. 
Qur remarks are limited to elementary and intermediate studies in English, 
UNIFORMITY OF SYSTEM WITH ELASTICITY IN DETAIL. 
The first thing that strikes us in this exhibit is the independent action that it- 
presents, combined with a unity of aim and object such as to convince the close 
observer that in no body is their greater harmony of action, combined with greater 
freedom in the application of pedagogic principles, than among Catholic teachers. 
Any impartial critic will admit that there is not a single new idea that has approved 
itself to conscientious instructors which does not find a place in some part of tho 
display. <A recent editorial in a leading educational journal in New York stated 
unreservedly that the religious teachers of this metropolis and vicinity are the most 
extensive and appreciative readers of school literature and of pedagogic publications, 
A close examination of the work presented, from the kindergarten to the college, 
shows this; for some of the very latest lessons published in leading school journals, 
many of the suggestions for special “class days” that have appeared within the last 
few months, have been adapted and used in some of the new work shown in this 
exhibit; while it is a well-known fact that many religious teachers from within a 
radius of 100 miles, or even more, have been daily visitors at the Catholic exhibit; 
just.as thousands of religious teachers came from great distances to study the Chi- 
cago educational display. 
Better still, in the normal methods presented by at least one of the training schools, 
it is evident that in the formation cf young teachers Catholic organizations are 
abreast of all that is best in modern methods. Though we refer to this normal col- 
lege in another portion of this article, we must here say that among the papers pre- 
sented by the normal scholars we noticed a series of studies on the great educators; 
besides giving the names of those who are generally included in such enumerations, 
the professor of the history of pedagogy has included several others thoroughly well 
known to continental readers, but whose claims, for some strange reasons, have been 
ignored in American publications. For terseness and brevity, combined with ampli- 
tude of analysis, these studies deserve more than this passing notice. 
Still more satisfactory is the fact that in all the leading branches of elementary, 
intermediate, and higher instruction Catholic writers offer works based upon the 
latest researches, and in line with the most advanced, accepted teachings of leading 
minds.  
-P-A-G-E-522
  
  512 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
THE SPIRIT OF PATRIOTISM INCULCATED. 
Another sentiment suggested by the general outline of the exhibit is one of legiti- 
mate national pride. His grace the most reverend archbishop might well declare 
that “we are all fond of our common country.” No general order, had it been given, 
could have brought about such a public expression of love for the national emblem. 
In every schoolbook, in some copy book of each school, in many of the literary 
compositions, the flag of our country and its history occupy a prominent place. It 
would be difficult to find a more direct proof of the love of country than is furnished 
in the sketches at the head of the lessons in United States history furnished by some 
_of the convents, and in the ‘‘Summaries of American topics” found in many of the 
boys’ schools. 
It is worthy of remark that some of the brightest ideas in patriotism, shown in 
these sketches, are the contributions from the schools directed by religious per- 
sons from abroad, who have been called to help the cause of education, which has 
developed so rapidly that local religious organizations have been unable to meet the 
demand for teachers. 
GEOGRAPHY AND HISTORY. 
While there is direct evidence of singleness of aim and purpose in most of the 
ordinary school work, there is also ample proof of a healthy individuality of action 
in the different plans adopted for the development of the teaching of geography, for 
the illustration of geographical terms, ana the intelligent coordination of geography, 
history, free-hand drawing, and natural science. Of more than usual worth are 
some of the raised maps. A few of these are of a very high order of merit, consid- 
ered artistically or from the pedagogic standpoint. It is no disparagement of the 
work shown in Chicago to say that there are maps in the Catholic exhibit surpass- 
ing the very best specimens shown in the White City. The application of needle- 
work to mapmaking is a feature that deserves all the praise it received. These 
samples came from ordinary parochial schools, though two or three convents had a 
larger collection of a more artistic type, a specimen from a female industrial school 
being the best. ‘Thé combination of colors in these threaded maps has a very pleas- 
ing effect. Harmonious work is evident in this geographical collection. Generally 
speaking, where one department of a parish school has good work, the other has 
followed suit. 
Bible history is shown in every variety of form by a large number of the schools. 
The illustrations that accompany these Bible lessons are not always of a high order 
of merit, but they may be the more readily accepted on this account. In this, as in 
all other work presented at the exhibit, the leading feature is the variety of merit 
as well as of grade, showing some very ordinary attempt beside work of artistic or 
literary value. This is an evidence of good faith that keen observers will appreciate. 
What is said of Bible illustrations will apply equally to English compositions, or 
simple class talks, founded on ordinary pictures. In several schools these illustra- 
tions have been culled from ordinary papers or magazines. Others have been taken 
from art journals. Some pupils have reproduced the illustrations as head pieces to 
their compositions, and in many cases the results are highly commendable, some 
showing evidence of really artistic merit as well as discrimination in selection, 
EXCELLENT PENMANSHIP. 
Much of the pen.nanship, particularly in the boys’ schools, is above the average. 
In a few cases it is very poor. If we may accept the pedagogic principle that pen- 
manship is the key to the discipline of the class, most of our Catholic schools leave 
nothing to be desired on this point. Some of the penmanship is of so high a grade, 
especially in some convents and in many parochial schools, that several teachers of 
non-Catholic schools have questioned the genuineness of the samples shown. These 
teachers forget that the artistic instinct is highly developed in the best grades of
-P-A-G-E-523
  AMERICAN VIEWS OF THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 513 
Catholic schools. The great attention paid to drawing in these schools has much to 
do with their success in penmanship. Still, we are free to admit that, in a few 
instances, claims are made that we could not reconcile with the age of the scholar 
and the class of penmanship said to be the pupils’. We revert again to the idea 
that every properly furnished and well-directed Catholic school is a gallery of reli- 
gious illustration. But this artistic surrounding is not in sympathy with the put- 
ting of poor penmanship, written in lead pencil, within costly binding. In fact, lead 
pencil writing is not desirable for young children. It does not call for light and 
shade, nor does it afford the digital drill that is an essential in every expert lesson 
in penmanship. Its redeeming feature is that it excludes the blotting and blurring 
so common in young children’s work, 
SENTENCE BUILDING—LANGUAGE LESSONS. 
We note with satisfaction the introduction of religious subjects into the construc- 
tion of sentences and the writing of elementary compositions. No intelligent critie 
will fail to perceive that lessons on religion present a class of terms and expressions 
that are not found in secular branches, These terms form no inconsiderable share of 
the pupil’s stock in language. Sentences formed with such words as the basis of 
construction must be of particular value, as thoughts are thus suggested and ideas 
developed that no other subjects can bring into play. In this group of school work 
are sets of instructions given on religious or moral truths by the reverend pastors or 
their assistants. ~ One boys’ reformatory hatl a series of shorthand reports of a series 
of sermons given during a mission or spiritual retreat. Another institution of the 
same kind for girls offered a collection of the instructions given to one of the sodali- 
ties. Many of these instructions are written by instructors who are in full sym- 
pathy with youthful minds, and there is a happy knack of illustration that shows a 
deep study of subjects with which children are pleasantly familiar. 
We again call attention to the evidence of freedom of action in each school, or even 
in the classes of each school. Each has something local in its work. A history of 
the parish, special accounts of the history of the school, the church, or the pastoral 
residence, and kindred topics create a parish spirit and a pride in parochial enter- 
prises that will bear good fruit in the near future. 
THE DRAWING CLASSES. 
Drawing is a leading branch in the exhibit. Much of the work shows excellent 
grading and isin line with the latest approved systems. In some of the largest speci- 
mens in oil or water colors the grouping isnot very happy; the foreshortening is par- 
ticularly defective. A few specimens in black and white are singularly lacking in 
taste. Perhaps a preliminary examination by a competent committee might debar 
such inartistic exhibits. Apart from these the exhibit is good. 
While speaking of drawing it may be in order to remark that several schools lim- 
ited their entire exhibit to a mere collection of pictures and sketches. This is nota 
fair test of a school’s standing. Itisto be regretted that these schools did not enter 
more fully into the spirit of the exhibit. Their art specimens give evidence of talent 
of so high an order that the same ability displayed in other directions would be sure 
to produce happy results. It is possible, also, that these schools could not get the 
space they needed to make a more complete exhibit. 
WORK OF THE PROTECTORIES. 
It is but simple justice to our homes, protectories, and industrial institutions to 
say that their exhibit in the art department is among the best in the display. The 
wood carving is excellent, the clay modeling—done in presence of the visitors—the 
application of drawing and sketching to practical industries were all very attrac- 
tive. The best collection of photographs was made by one of these schools; but 
ED 93. 33   
 
-P-A-G-E-524
    514 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
while this is good in its way, we do not consider that photographs, however artistic 
or numerous, are a fair exchange for actual work. 
In their ordinary school work these industrial and correctional establishments 
surpass many parochial schools. We naturally expect the manual training in the 
former to excel, but when we bear in mind that the inmates of these industrial 
schools have much shorter hours of study than ordinary day schools we are obliged 
to admit that the scholars must be anxious to learn, influenced, probably, by kind 
treatment, to which they had previously been strangers, while the teachers throw 
their whole energy and talent into the Christ-like work of redeeming youth through 
the combined influence of mind and heart. 
PROGRESS IN SCHOOL WORK—THE ANALYTICAL METHOD IN ENGLISH GRAMMAR. 
The writer having devoted several months to the study of school work presented 
by Catholic schools at the London Health Exposition in 1884, at the New Orleans 
Cotton Centennial in 1885, and at the Chicago Fair in the past year, can bear will- 
ing testimony to the evidences of progress which this Catholic exhibit makes. 
In the teaching of English a certain number of schools follow an admirable sys- 
tem, to which we have already called attention. A limited number of illustrations 
are carefully analyzed. Several sets of suggestions are given by which the same 
illustration may be studied from different points, thus making each illustration 
answer for several compositions. In grammatical analysis the diagram system 
appears to be still in favor, but in many-cases where blue and black prints are used 
the script is so indistinct as to be practically illegible, and the analytical distinctions 
are lost. 
In some of the academies, particularly in one of the oldest female academies of 
New York, we found some admirable literary work, based upon the study of the 
great American and a few of the leading English writers. Longfellow appears to 
be a great favorite. In at least two schools we found “Evangeline” exhaustively 
studied—with such association of composition, history, rhetoric, and declamation 
(or recitation) as the selection permits. No attempt was made in either of the con- 
vents or academies designated to give meritorious value to the copy books by any 
decoration or illumination, The work is allowed to stand on its merits, 
UNITED STATES HISTORY. 
In the advanced parochial schools, and in most of the academies, marked improve- 
ment upon the Chicago exhibit is seen in the study of United States history. The 
number of maps based on the critical study of the text is unusually large. While 
the coloring in many maps, especially some prepared by boys, is too deep and glar- 
ing, most are extremely good as studies, and more particularly as companion works 
to the text they are intended to illustratu. a still more striking improvement is the 
evidence furnished by much of this work that many reference books are at the sery- 
ice of the scholars In several schools we found the same point in history examined 
from almost as many authors as there were scholars in the class. Particular atten- 
tion has also been paid in the best schools to the reading that is recommended in 
most recent works in United States history. Poetry of a patriotic character bearing 
upon these historical questions has been read, and in many cases illustrated. 
DRAWING AS APPLIED TO MANUAL TRAINING. 
The application of drawing to manual training in our ordinary schools is develop- 
ing rapidly. One parochial school in the outskirts of New York City has a series of 
specimens of graining, in imitations of various kinds of wood, which is so very good 
that we find it difficult not to give it special mention. 
But the most perfect work of this kind that we can recall is furnished by a group 
of students who took their own measurements, rough sketched their plans on the 
grounds, made their own estimates of expense, and then, in a set of charts almost 
 
-P-A-G-E-525
  
AMERICAN VIEWS OF THE COLUMBIAN EXposITIoN. 515 
perfect in color and design, have developed every part of their work with most com- 
plete detail and entire success. Neither London in 1884 nor New Orleans in 1885 
had any such work. Part of this exhibit was at Chicago; other portions, notably 
some specimens of surveying, were completed only during the last days of the Cath- 
olic exhibit. His grace the most reverend archbishop has called special attention 
to this work. 3 < 
TYPEWRITING AND SHORTHAND. 
Phonography and typewriting appear to be on the wane. <A few convents have 
taken up both, for one appears to be of little service without the other; but the 
boys’ schools seem to show less than formerly. Probably the market has been glutted 
with immature operators; in any case, this class of employment, outside of public 
Government work, appears to be passing into female hands. 
The typewriting shown in most of the schools is excellent. Two academies sent 
pupils to report the addresses of the speakers on the first night of the exhibit. Their 
transcripts were accepted by some of the metropolitan journals as equal in accuracy 
to the work done by professional reporters. 
Some of the fancy work done by three schools was photographed at the expense 
of the companies whose machines were used. This figured work is done only during 
free time, and it is no exaggeration to say that the birds, flowers, buildings, etc., 
ereated by the typewriter are almost as lifelike and as expressive as if done by pencil 
or brush. 
Much more practical is another class of school work done by the typewriter. In 
two commercial academies the manifolding process has been employed to multiply 
copies of some excellent notes of lessons and developments of class topics. In this 
way the teachers of one city may distribute specimens of their best work to others, 
and thus disseminate excellent class work at very little trouble or expense. In some 
schools all the class specimens of typewriting are in capital letters. This is an easy 
way to write out any copy, but it spoils the appearance of the page, and should be 
used only when the pupil is beginning and unable to use both classes of type. 
Speaking of commercial specimens recalls the fact that some of the bookkeeping 
sets presented by girls’ schools are not as practical as they might be. Apart from 
this criticism, there is a variety of work showing conclusively that the bookkeeping 
sets are not mere reproductions from printed samples. Some of the sets are thor- 
oughly original. Perhaps more explanation of the theory of the science of accounts 
should have been shown. 
One school presented a series of charts showing the relation of the different books 
used in bookkeeping; the idea, if not entirely original, has been seen but seldom at — 
any of the great exhibits. This same school has thoroughly good commercial work 
throughout. “ 
  KINDERGARTEN WORK—PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS OF DES: 
  A very striking part of the display was the vast amount of kindergarten work 
and the accumulation of specimens in wood and clay. This is the natural outcome 
of the deep interest that most Catholic teachers have shown in following some of 
the principal courses of industrial work furnished by technical classes. As experi- 
ence has taught, manual training in ordinary schools must be limited to some very 
simple lessons in the handling of materials that are easily procured and not costly. 
Within these limitations the specimens which are offered by a very large percentage 
of the schools deserve study and analysis. The designs are almost limitless, and add 
another to the many proofs furnished that teachers in Catholic schools are allowed 
a healthy liberty of action that appears to be out of harmony with purely govern- 
mental institutions. The French minister of education who boasted that he could at 
any hour of the day tell what each child was doing in any school, in any part of France, 
would not recognize his iron-bound regulations in the extraordinary variety of method. 
that these kindergarten and manual specimens furnish. Such magnificent specimens 
 
-P-A-G-E-526
  516 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
as the new seminary, the miniature furniture, the models of illustration used in 
natural science, the church vestments on a tiny scale, the endless variety of methods 
in geography—all these would be relegated to a committee; rigid rules to which all 
must submit would be the order of the day; the schools would become part of a huge 
machine from which all originality would be ostracized, and in which healthy indi- 
viduality would be a defect, not a virtue. For years English common schools were 
conducted on this cast-iron system, and teachers were driven to desperation trying 
t» keep within rules and regulations that settled everything, from the time-table to 
the luncheon counter. Better counsels now prevail. Great personal liberty is allowed 
to teachers in the direction of their respective schools or classes. Results are deter- 
mined by the general tone of the school, not by percentages in which fright has often 
more to do than intelligence. The consequence is that Her Majesty’s inspectors report 
vast improvement. The schools are, individually, conducted on lines best suited to 
the locality. There we have just such independent acticn, under reasonable general 
regulations, as is responsible to a great extent for the excellence of the results we 
notice in this Catholic exhibit. 
FREEDOM OF SPIRIT IN SCHOOL WORK. 
  We are glad to see this freedom illustrated in the matter of languages. It is not 
desirable that every language but the English should be banished from our common 
schools, On the other hand, we realize the difficulty of attempting much in this line. 
What this Catholic exhibit presents in modern languages is limited to simple exer- 
cises in German and French. Some of the female academies have full courses in both 
these languages; a few parochial schools have less extensive exhibits in German 
translations. It is a striking fact that some Irish-American boys who attend German 
schools are first in German. ‘This occurs in a sufficient number of cases to make it 
deserving of remark. Furthermore, several schools show tests of spelling that seem 
to decide the question whether the study of English and German simultaneously is 
injurious to the pupil. In a large number of instances German boys spell in English 
more accurately than their American companions. As several branches may be taught 
in German or French as well as in English—catechism, mental arithmetic, history, 
ete.—it strikes us that where a pupil has already an elementary knowledge of a 
modern foreign tongue, it is unfair not to give him some chance to preserve and 
develop this extra language. It is a knotty question, but it deserves a solution. 
Americans are at a decided disadvantage when traveling abroad; as a rule, they do 
not speak any language but their own. At the present time several governments 
urge the study of at least one modern language besides their own, Americans should 
not be too far behind in this matter. 
NATURAL SCIENCE BRANCHES. 
In the department of natural science the general exhibit is nut extensive. Ad- 
vanced grades in some conyents show fair work; in the same grade of boys’ acad- 
emies the display is better. The only normal college that exhibits has unusually 
good papers in natural philosophy and physiology. Several advanced schools have 
excellent collections of botanical specimens collected by the students. We fear that 
these schools will not feel encouraged to display their collections again. In several 
cases the specimens have been so roughly handled as to injure their future value, It 
is well to save time, but the desire to save should not permit examiners to open care- 
fully arranged specimens and then leave them unclosed after examination. This 
and many other matters will cure themselves in time, but meanwhile the collectors 
must be satisfied with the assurance that several enthusiastic students have learned 
their first lessons in forming collections. To have so launched even one new searcher 
into the botanical field is to have made a mortal happy, even if at the cost of spoiled 
specimens and battered specimen cases,
-P-A-G-E-527
   
      
          
  AMERICAN VIEWS OF THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION, 517 
  Referring again to natural philosophy, and also to elementary astronomy, we 
think that these two subjects are not taught as generally as in former years. This 
is the more surprising when we recall the fact that so many excellent manuals are 
now published, and that instruments for illustration are so much cheaper than in 
past years. But, what is most surprising is the total absence of any home-made 
specimens of articles used in simple experiments. 
We know that such collections exist in a few schools, but regret that no one has 
ventured to show them. This criticism does not apply to the sketches and designs 
furnished by some of the academies or colleges. One academy on the Hudson pre- 
sented a very complete set of illustrations done with consummate taste and intelli- 
gence. All the practical work of this excellent school is equally good. 
OBJECT-LESSON METHODS. 
Those who have followed the progress of elementary teaching as seen through the 
educational expositions of Philadelphia, London, New Orleans, and Chicago must be 
struck by the sudden appearance or disappearance of certain features. As a striking 
instance, we may recall the subject of object lessons. For several years the educa- 
tional journals were incessant in urging the importance of these lessons in developing 
the perceptive powers of children. Numberless groupings of objects were presented, 
stages of evolution from the crude: material to the finished specimen were shown, 
everything that ingenuity could devise to attract the pupil’s attention was done. 
In the New Orleans exhibition school collections were a most prominent feature; in 
Chicago the public schools as well as most private institutions had a few complete 
displays of the kind, while in the Catholic exhibit not more than a dozen schools 
showed anything like a serious attempt at such classifications. But one school out- 
side the city, so far as we could find, has made a successful, detailed, and scientific 
collection of object lessons, In this school local industries have been studied, 
descriptions of visits made to these centers are furnished, and an intelligent 
grouping of the materials employed in these industries enables the examiner to get 
an excellent idea of the various processes involved in each. This school took up the 
study of object lessons on a scientific basis. The aim has not been to get a lot of 
things together and label them “object lessons.” On the contrary, a specific end 
has been kept in view, limiting the study to local industries, These industries have 
been taken up in their natural order, a regular course of study established, and a 
systematized plan of visiting the industrial centers arranged. 
The result lias been, not a spasmodic effort to secure a short-lived though brilliant 
success, but a calm, progressive, intelligent arrangement, whose outcome is the splen- 
did collection this school has brought together. Object lessons require teaching of 
the highest order to maintain their hold. Mere collecting of objects will not suffice. 
ARITHMETIC—RECENT CHANGES IN TEACHING. 
As yet we have said nothing about arithmetic, mental or written. For some years 
past w simultaneous attack has been made on what is supposed to be the unnecessary 
attention given to this subject. It isnot easy to take sides consistently in a dispute 
that calls for such wholesale condemnation of what was done by teachers who were 
our superiors in the mathematical line, and who in many other respects, especially in 
the teaching of elementary natural philosophy, far surpassed us in their success. 
Perhaps too much attention was paid at one time, and is still being paid, to certain 
phases of: commercial arithmetic that have lost theirimportance. Butitis certainly 
incorrect to claim that mental arithmetic is receiving undue attention. On the con- 
trary, unless we are much mistaken, it is the neglect of this most practical form of 
arithmetic that renders the teaching of written work so difficult. Among all the 
papers on arithmetic we notice very few in which mental calculations take the promi- 
nence to which they are entitled. Some teachers have been complimented on their 
methods of teaching the extraction of roots. From the cursory examination made

   of these special claims we think that they are well founded. The teachers who use 
these methods should suggest that they he introduced into the text-books on arith- 
metic studied in their classes. Considered as a whole, the copy books of arithmetic 
are not remarkable for the excellence of the figures; the ruling is poorly done, and, 
unnecessary use of colored inks does not improve the appearance of the solutions of 
problems. 
The same criticism holds good in regard to the specimens of bookkeeping. As 
much of the colored ink used is of an inferior grade, and some of the paper is not 
well sized, the writing spreads, the ruling becomes blurred, and the entire work has 
an unkempt appearance. This is not the rule, but it applies to many exceptions. 
        
PHOTOGRAPHY. 
   One of the chief innovations is the very extensive usc of photography in the 
reproduction of groups, in the development of local history, and in the study of 
natural science. It is surprising, however, that so few teachers haye employed 
photography in the teaching of penmanship, the preservation of original synoptic 
tables, and in combination with the phonograph for the teaching of elocution. In 
a few of the highest academies, especially in one or two, remarkable scenes con- 
nected with the early development of school property, the collections of specimens, 
and photographs of graduates are thus preserved, Much more could have been done 
to reproduce copies of military cadet corps, of military movements, ete. A few schools 
have camera clubs and do good service for various classes and associations by keep- 
ing a running collection illustrative of the chief events in school life. This feature 
of school illustration should be encouraged. 
  NREASONABLE CRITICISM— 
  {LOSING REMARKS.     
The chief criticism, based upon a careful study, referred to the lack of complete- 
ness in the work shown by many schools. In these cases it was found that much of 
the work in those schools, though excellent in itself, did not fit into any general 
plan followed by the teachers. It was the opinion of many that there was an excess 
of drawing and a lack of ordinary school work. While this remark holds good in 
some respects, visitors should have borne in mind that drawings or sketches are 
about the only class of work that could be hung on the temporary separations. Most 
schools had as much ordinary bookwork as they could well display. It might have 
been more varied in character, but it was sufficiently great in quantity. Several 
eritics remarked that many teachers did all the fine work on the covers of the 
ordinary copy books; in most cases this fact was acknowledged, and the exact work 
done by the children was indicated. ; 
Nearly all the old schools throughout the diocese did excellent work. There was 
a delicacy of touch ia what they did that showed the power of good habits once 
established. In many cases work was shown from years gone by. This afforded an 
opportunity to compare old methods with the new. The number of teachers who 
presented extensive collections of notes of lessons was not great. Strictly speaking, 
this comes under the head of normal work; still, as an indication of the line of 
thought running. through any particular body of teachers, such notes would be of 
more than ordinary interest. It is said that many attributed much of certain classes 
of literary work to the influence of one well-known educator. While this may be 
an exaggeration, it is certain that each teaching body has its characteristic methods 
of presentation of subjects. These traits would easily be noticed in the course of a 
certain number of ‘notes of lessons.” The same holds true of individual teachers. 
EARNESTNESS IN TEACHING. 
Judging from the great number of teachers who were taking notes, and from the 
many questions asked about special exhibits, we feel certain that the greatest pos- 
sible interest is felt in the principles that underlie the successful school work here

  AMERICAN VIEWS OF THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 519 
exhibited, With a closer study of school methods, and a closer examination into the 
plans and programmes followed by those who have made the most successful exhibits, 
there is no doubt but that Catholic teachers will become still more efficient. Our 
Catholic schools have shown their work; what that work is all have a chance to see 
and appreciate. : 
Well might Mayor Gilroy in his opening speech declare that ‘One of the proud- 
est aims of man or woman ought to be to teach the youth of the country how to 
exercise the rights of citizenship when they came to man’s estate.” 
‘The parochial schools,” he said, ‘are doing this, and, as the present exhibition 
shows, are doing other very great and noble duties.” There were 10, 000 children in 
the city who did not possess the means of obtaining an early education. There were 
60,000 pupils who attended the parochial. schools, and 18,000 attending private 
schools. He declared that if all these children were to be thrown suddenly on the 
public school system great confusion would result. ‘If this were the only benefit 
the parochial schools conferred, it would entitle them to the gratitude of the entire 
people of the community.” | 
And with equal force did Colonel Fellows say in his closing address: ‘Go on with 
your work. It is protected from the skies, It means a blessing to earth. God, and 
the voice of all proper humanity, will crown it with an undying benediction.” 
THE CATHOLIC SCHOOL EXHIBIT. 
CHAN 
  ES IN METHODS OF TEACHERS. 
Among honest teachers there is an earnest wish to get together, to learn from suc- 
cessful example how to do the greatest amount of work with the least useless expendi- 
ture of energy, with greatest positive results. 
In the Catholic school exhibit of New, York (which was to all intents and purposes 
the same as the Chicago exhibit) there were some features that struck us as being in 
the right direction and as being of real assistance in the very eae Peg feature of 
the best methods of presentation of elementary subjects. 
In the use of illustrations drawn from everyday topics the exhibit was singularly 
rich. Most deserving of mention is the fact that very young children put together 
the parts needed in the illustration where such was feasible. These illustrations 
were particularly suggestive when applied to definitions of geography. 
As we mention geography, it may be the proper place to state that this subject 
shows great variety in treatment. The use of colored threads played a large part in 
the development of illustrations. Great variety of wording was perceptible in the 
phrasing; freedom in the use of children’s words was a striking feature in the best 
taught schools. 
In United States history the best modern methods were to be found among the 
work of select schools and in some of the parochial classes. The combination or 
coordination of literature and history was generally perceptible. A very salient 
feature of the United States history was the comparison between the assertions made 
by Winsor and similar authorities in books prepared to meet the demand foreColum- 
pian literature, and that of American authors of accepted worth, whose works have 
been before the public for some time, and whose assertions, particularly about Colum- 
bus, had hitherto been unquestioned. 
The use of synoptic tables, prepared by the pupils themselves, has become very 
general.. Summaries prepared in the same way are also largely employed. ‘These 
indicate original work. The same holds true of the tracings and sketches that many 
children added to their literary summaries. 
Penmanship shows considerable improvement over previous exhibitions. Practical 
problems in arithmetic have, to a marked degree, supplanted the old-time form in 
which abstract numbers played so prominent a part. In girls’ schools the “ Bills of 
parcels,” as the old arithmetics were wont to call shopping accounts, were largely  
-P-A-G-E-530

  used. Home-made collections of plants, flowers, words, etc., added to the interest 
of a few schools; in a few instances pupils furnished an account of how the collect- 
ing had been effected. 
In the industrial schools pupils appear to be well instructed in the handling of 
material so as to entail the least possible waste. The Catholic Protectory had a cer- 
tain number of boys who carried on their trades in the presence of the people. The 
deviation from mere silent exhibition to actual work was an agreeable surprise. 
Perhaps the most progressive feature of the school exhibit is the extensive use of 
photography. Itis surprising to find the unusual lines in which it has been employed, 
offhand blackboard sketches, developments of literary or historical periods specially 
prepared by the teacher, the principles of penmanship—these and a hundred other 
topics have been reproduced by the pupils and preserved for future reference. The 
combination of reading and simple composition is another feature that deserves com- 
mendation. It has been carried out in a thoroughly logical manner in a large num- 
ber of the boys’ schools. 
There are many other subjects, typewriting, phonography, bookkeeping, geometry, 
and mensuration, algebra, modern lan guages, etc., to which we might refer and that 
would offer matter for interesting discussion or remark, but we have mentioned a 
sufficient number of subjects to show that the Catholic exhibit deserved attention, 
and received it, from a large percentage of the earnest teachers of New York and 
vicinity. Perhaps the most pleasing feature of the entire exhibit was the friendly 
spirit in which the work was discussed by public-school teachers. It was a common 
thing to see black-robed sisters in earnest discussion with their trimly dressed com- 
panions on the great question of methods and means by which we all seek to become 
more successful in the great work of making the rough ways smooth and the narrow 
way wider for the youth of our common country. (I. C. N., in New York School 
Journal.)

INTRODUCTION. 
The World’s Fair, and the International Educational Congress held in connection 
with the Fair, brought to the United States a number of German, Austrian, and 
Swiss educators of high position and well-earned distinction. They not only care- 
fully examined the results of school education on exhibition at the World’s Fair, 
but spent weeks and months in a critical examination of our system of common, 
elementary, secondary, and higher education, as well as special, technological, art, 
and professional schools, for the purpose of reporting to their respective Govern- 
ments upon the condition and results of education in Ameri 
‘The United States had entered into competition with the civilized world in show- 
ing its educational facilities and their results at the World’s Fair, and the European 
and other foreign educators who came to this country to study our schools, discov 
ered peculiar features in our system that can not be found in any other country. 
The German visitors reported in writing, and most of these reports have been 
printed in Germany, where they caused much interest and astonishment. It can not 
be said that these reports are in every case absolutely correct, on the contrary, they 
exhibit palpable errors; yet, it is remarkable with what a felicity these observers 
detect the characteristics of American culture, and with what directness they point 
them out to their countrymen. They find much to blame in America. But we notice 
the praiseworthy fact, that these men in nearly all cases found the causes, or sought 
for the causes, of things that appeared to them strange. Tbis proved that they 
were accustomed to work scientifically, to think philosophically, and act honestly. 
I. Dr. Emil Hausknecht, director of the second city Realschule in Berlin, who for 
many years was professor in the national university of Tokyo, Japan, published in 
the annual catalogue of his school the following report on American education. It 
is here reproduced in English version, only certain insertions and quotations are 
omitted (such as examination questions). He dwells on some features of American 
education that he considers an honor and a glory of this country, and points out some 
of its defects, The impartial, objective way in which he does this is noteworthy.

May the foregoing words of good King Alfred excuse the incoherency and frag- 
mentary nature of the following remarks. They are the result of observations and 
experiences, as well as of the study of accumulated printed matter, gathered on my

journeys through the United States during the summer and fall of 1890 and 1893. I 
have not as yet had the leisure to work them up systematically. 
He who has had the pleasure of crossing the United States, leisurely observing 
what he saw, and who has had the privilege of finding in his various places of 
sojourn the kindest reception and enlightening expression of ideas on the part of 
leading persons in science and promoters of popular education; he who has seen 
with his own eyes, especially in the West, the innumerable palace-like institutions 
for public education, churches, libraries, and Christian association buildings. for 
young people, and gymnasia for schools, and in a measure has learned the piety and 
liberality of their promoters and founders, will know that in that country, though 
it is partly still in primitive development, yet every where progressing with gigantic 
strides, and disregarding Old World prejudices, something higher rules than ‘filthy 
lucre,” which, under the present circumstances of civilization, can scarcely be called 
“filthy ” any longer. 
A prominent preacher expressed himself during the Sunday services in Trinity 
Church, previous to the beginning of the winter semester of Yale University in the - 
old and venerable Elm City of New Haven, as follows: ‘It is a passion for education, 
a noble eagerness for knowledge and culture that has become a perfect craze, that 
has seized the whole American people at’ present.” Dr. W. T. Harris, the United 
States Commissioner of Education, said to me in one of our pleasant and instructive 
interviews: “It is a heart hunger for education, a ravenous appetite for culture that 
is felt in all strata of society, in the middle and lower classes of the people, as well 
as in the upper classes; it works like an elementary force, and urges onward and 
upward.” We need not wonder that things sometimes are placed topsy-turvy in a 
country the people of which create everything through their own power and out of 
themselves, and it must be borne in mind that in the peculiar development of its 
conditions it lacks a centralized government, one that thinks for all, and guides the 
people even in questions of detail; a government in which the traditions of experi- 
enced and well-qualified experts is embodied; of men who are conscious of the object 
to be attained. Neither have the States of the Old World, moving in regulated con- 
ditions, always avoided mistakes in the domain of education, and it is these very 
States which have to overcome a system firmly established in order to do justice to 
new principles arising from special conditions. 
The cause of this universal desire for education in America is partly found in the 
fact that the common school education is quite inefficient and madequate. A gen- 
eral law for compulsory school attendance is not in existence, and an astonishingly 
large ratio of the population has grown up without any instruction in school. AIL 
che more intense becomes the consciousness of the want of an education in after 
years, particularly in a country where there are no rules and regulations for the 
preparation for professions or occupations. If with us anyone ‘changes saddles” 
that is, his profession), his action is in most cases subject to the disapproval of pub- 
lic opinion, or to that of his circle of acquaintances. In America—at least as yet— 
everyone, even a common laborer, may become anything and everything, even Presi- 
dent, if he understands how and has learned enough to make wise use of cireum- 
stances. It is quite immaterial how he acquired his knowledge, or whether he can 
by written testimonials prove to be in possession of such knowledge. It is not at all 
arare case to meet men who, as boys, peddled matches, newspapers, and other things 
in order to support mother and sisters, and who at times, when they had saved 
enough, “did a little toward getting an education,” until finally they had worked 
their way up to be social leaders of the people. Every inhabitant of that country 
has an exalted opinion (mostly exaggerated) of his own capacity, hence it is not to 
be wondered at that the intense aspiration toward an ‘education” for practical 
reasons permeates all the laboring classes. Every sensible workman, who likes to 
speak of the equality of all citizens, and yet instinctively feels the inequality caused 
by difference in social position, aspires to be, or at least wishes to be, considered a

gentleman in his appearance, manners, and actions. As a gentleman he does not 
drink liquor, and smokes little or not at all.! 
The motives that urge the cultured and wealthy classes to a liberal and incessant 
participation in raising the level of education of the lower classes are quite differ- 
ent. They have long recognized that a constitution resting upon the principle of 
“democracy, like the American, finds its greatest enemy in the ignorance and want 
of judgment of the masses, and believe that this danger may be met by popular 
education as high and extended as possible. To these political motives may be 
traced back (partly at least) the efforts made in behalf of advanced instruction for 
girls. The men are almost exclusively occupied from an early age in obtaining a 
livelihood; though, by life’s experiences and the reading of journals, magazines, and 
books written in popular style, they endeavor to educate themselves, the average 
“schooling” the boys get is of a comparatively brief period; hence it is deemed 
advisable to secure for the girls—the mothers and teachers of the future genera- 
tion—the benefits of a most thorough education. 
It is of course plain that, aside from these political considerations, often exclu- 
sively philanthropic motives come into play which lead to liberal bequests for pur- 
poses of education. : 
After these general remarks a few features of the American system of education 
may be discussed. I have neither leisure nor available space to enter into the 
minute details of the entire system. It seems to me advisable, however, to touch 
upon a few points necessary for a general comprehension of the entire system before 
entering into a discussion of any separate branch. It shall be done briefly and 
without claim upon systematic arrangement. 
There is no national organization of the school system, embracing uniformly the 
entire school system of the country; in fact, it would be impossible, owing to the 
unequal development of the separate States, which, taken together, have an area 
fifteen times the area of the German Empire. The Bureau of Edacation in Wash- 
ington, a part of the Department of the Interior, is merely a statistical bureau of 
public instruction, without any authoritative or directive power. The establish- 
ment, maintenance, and organization of the school system are concerns of the sepa- 
rate States, and they devote themselves to this task with great zeal. Public opinion, 
conscious of the fact that the heaithy development of the State depends upon a well- 
organized school system, tries to attract a large immigration from other States by 
establishing excellent institutions of learning. Furthermore there is a noble rivalry 
kept up among the States, which is the cause of there being few States that do not 
think their institutions the best in the Union, the “best in the world,” or at least 
nurse a conviction that they soon will be. 
The supreme authority in school matters is, in most States, vested in a State 
board of education, which endeavors to elevate the whole system of public educa- 
tion of the State acording to a uniform plan, and whose especial anxiety is to pro- 
mote the general and professional education of the teachers, both men and women. 
In some States the number of women teachers reaches the high proportion of 90 per 
cent of the total number. To the large cities, which consider it an honor to do as 
much as possible for education, the law grants almost complete liberty in levying 
school taxes; this liberty increases the ‘joy in giving” and the possibility for new, 
progressive measures. The highest degree of perfection of any of the numerous 
school systems may be found in Boston, or, generally speaking, in the State of Massa- 
chusetts. Comparatively well developed are the schools also in Minneapolis, St. 
Paul, Indianapolis, and Washington. A similar opinion may be held concerning 
entire States like Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, Minnesdta, Iowa, Michi- 
gan, and others.

  524 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Immense sums are expended for the maintenance and elevation of the system of 
instruction, not only by the States and communities, but likewise through grand and 
liberal bequests and donations. Aside from colleges and a few other institutions 
instruction is gratuitous; some States, like California, Wisconsin, Virginia, Texas, 
Michigan, and others, have even free “universities,” which, howeyer, with the partial 
exception of Ann Arbor, actually rank as colleges. Appliances also are furnished 
free, and not only text-books, but everything needed in manual training and cookery, 
and in physics and chemistry, for which every pupil has his own experimenting 
and work table. With regard to the advantages of free text-books and the uniform 
ity caused thereby, the opinions differ. Free schoolbooks for entire States seem 
to have essentially influenced the quality of the books by paralyzing the productive 
energy of authors. New and more methodically arranged schoolbooks are rare of 
late years. Gratuity of the entire instruction and free text-books and appliances 
belong to the many devices which have been resorted to in order to allure as many 
pupils as possible into school, and to keep them there, since compulsory attendance 
can not be enforced. 
In theory America possesses the common school (Einheitsschule). After the pri- 
mary school, intended for children from 6 to 10, follows the grammar school for 
children from 10 to 14; the continuation of this institution is the high school of — 
three or four yearly courses, which is partly an institution for the preparation for 
practical life, and partly a preparatory school for the college. The grammar school 
corresponds more or less with the upper grades of our people’s school of six, seven, or 
eightgrades. It is fundamentally different from the English grammar school, which 
may be compared to our gymnasium, and like our gymnasium (‘ Real-Gymnasium” 
and ‘Real-Schule”) stands entirely outside of the system of the common school. An 
American boy who has passed through the grammar school is said to have graduated, 
while an English boy who goes through the course with credit up to 14, is said to have 
passed the seventh standard. While thus, in theory, the course through the Amer- 
ican common primary, grammar, and high school leads to the college, the facts do 
not correspond to this everywhere. The colleges distrust the education of the high 
school and, indeed, the transfer from a high school to a college is possible only 
when the former has observed the conditions of admission required by the college, 
and when it stands in more or less intimate relations to the respective college. Com- 
paratively few high schools maintain such relations. Those high schools on the 
other hand, which are considered primarily preparatory schools for colleges, distrust 
the education offered in the grammar schools; so that some parents who intend their 
children to enter the high school, withdraw them from the grammar school before 
the completion of the course, and have them privately prepared for an entrance 
examination to the high school. 
The colleges are a kind of intermediate institution between our gymnasium and 
university, representing the work of the upper grades of a gymnasium and that of 
one or two years at a university, as we understand those terms. They are mostly 
institutions with dormitories, lying remote from the noisy din of cities, surrounded 
by park-like grounds. In the colleges physical exercises are very popular. While, 
with few exceptions, no beer drinking or smoking is found, yet the student’s life 
here is very gay, full of fun and pranks. To be sure, work is done here, and a great 
deal of it, for at the end of each of the three or four terms of the year an examina- 
tion has to be passed. Unlike our universities, most American colleges have the 
purpose of transmitting knowledge. The chief object of our universities, which is 
to guide the students to independent scientific production, lies entirely outside of 
the scope of the college. But some colleges attempt this by retaining their own 
graduates, i. c., those who have passed the finishing examination after a three-years’ 
successful attendance at college, and offering them in so-called post-graduate courses 
(in contradistinction to undergraduate courses) opportunities for scientific work. 
A few colleges admit only post-graduate students. Such institutions are called, at   
 
-P-A-G-E-535
    
GERMAN CRITICISM OF AMERICAN EDUCATION. 525 
times, universities. The term university is frequently given to other institutions 
that do not deserve it, and are not recognized as such in the learned world. Alto- 
gether there are nearly 400 colleges in the United States. * * * 
“Of the colleges (universities) Bryn Mawr is exclusively for women; three, Chi- 
cago, Cornell, and Ann Arbor, admit men and women on precisely similar terms 
to all departments of the university, both to the undergraduate and to the post- 
graduate courses; and one, Yale, admits without distinction of sex to the graduate 
courses, but not to the undergraduate courses. In the University of Pennsylvania 
advanced instruction is given in the graduate department for women, which offers 
all the courses that the university faculty of philosophy does. * * * Some of the 
advanced courses at Harvard are given every year to women precisely as to men, 
through the Society for the Collegiate Instruction of Women, ‘Harvard Annex.’ 
* * * At Columbia (in New York) the register of students in the school of politi- 
cal science contains the names of women, and also that of the university faculty of 
philosophy; women are in attendance at Barnard College, a kind of an annex for 
women in Columbia College, in which, I remember to have heard with pleasure, les- 
sons in Euripides, in Old English, in Hermann and Dorothea, and in French grammar.” 
The foregoing paragraph made us acquainted with another characteristic of the 
American system of education, the so-called coeducation, simultaneous instruction 
of boys and girls in the same class rooms, and in the same subjects,' in the primary, 
grammar, and high school, as well as in colleges and universities. Formerly coedu- 
cation was resorted to much more frequently in Germany than now. In the Western 
States of America it was first used as a makeshift, but it has in the course of the last 
ten years spread farther and farther East, and is now found in all the New England 
States, which are remarkaple for their firmly-fixed institutions and high degree of 
culture. The most important of the higher institutions of learning in New England 
reject coeducation in high schools and colleges, I think, with good reason. In quite 
a number of States coeducation is practiced in all schools. Concerning the advan- 
tages and disadvantages of this mode of education lengthy and heated controversies 
have been filling the columns of the press. 
As a makeshift coeducation is better than nothing. As a principle, it entirely 
ignores the needs of the separate sexes arising from the differences in the develop- 
ment of boys and girls. Boys and girls in the ages from 14 to 18 must be differently 
treated, both in regard to the intellectual and the emotional nature. Coeducation 
is possible, however, in America more than in Germany or elsewhere, because custom 
and education have given to the girl and the woman greater freedom and determi- 
nation in their manners and appearance, and have also given them strong protection 
against encroachment and improprieties. Coeducation is possible in America for two 
other reasons: The week has only five school days, Saturday heing a holiday, and the 
school day has only five lessons, of which one is usually a study hour. Besides, gram- 
mar and high schools require much less severe intellectual effort and a much more con- 
centrated and simple exertion of the mind than is required in our secondary schools 
for boys. In the grammar schools foreign languages are not taught at all; in the 
high schools only two foreign languages are taught, of which the second scarcely 
proceeds beyond mere rudiments. 
In modern languages I have found everywhere (with the exception of Boston, 
which certainly has the best schools) a method of instruction which beggars descrip- 
tion, for it is a waste of time and calls for no intellectual labor on the part of pupils 
and teacher. The consequences of beginning the study of foreign languages so late 
are very serious. They are manifested in the very small amount of knowledge in 
the languages with which the student enters college, so that there he is frequently 
subjected to mere elementary exercises, The consequences are seen also in the 
defective linguistic-logical discipline of the mind, which perhaps more than the dis-

  cipline in mathematical forms of thought is a requisite of all profound intellectual : 
progress, be that in linguistic or in mathematical and scientific branches. This dis- 
cipline is especially necessary, in fact an essential requisite of independent intel- 
lectual work, and the present American method of beginning the study of languages 
is entirely inadequate. The other disadvantage of a defective linguistic discipline, 
namely, the want of thorough comprehension of the mother tongue in America, is 
compensated in most colleges by excellent exercises in the written and oral use of 
English. 
Another peculiarity of the American system of schools is the extensive employ- 
ment of women in teaching, not only in primary and grammar schools, where they 
are employed almost exclusively, but also in high schools, and at times in colleges. 
It is unquestionable that some women are gifted with special physical and intel, 
Jectual powers, able to successfully cope in scientific equipment, methodical skill, 
and pedagogical tact with many of the best male teachers in (let us say, in order 
to remain on the firm ground of actual observation) Latin, Greek, physics, chemistry, 
and mathematics.! Generally speaking, the lower degree of physical power of 
resistance in woman causes a lower degree of executive ability. A more extensive 
employment of thoroughly prepared men in high schools would very preceptibly 
raise the level of these schocls. But men are not numerous as teachers in America, 
not even in the high schools. Public life offers positions with much higher emolu- 
ments than those of the schoolmaster and professor. ‘The one circumstance that 
comparatively few men devote themselves to teaching in grammar and high 
schools, reacts naturally upon the quality of the teachers engaged; but of course 
I do notemean to say that there are no thorough teachers in these institutions. 
Generally speaking, it may be asserted that one kind of high schools, called 
English high schools, in which modern languages and natural science predominate 
over the classical languages, is, according to our conception, scarcely more than an 
advanced elementary or citizen’s school. In these schools, if they happen to have 
one or two thoroughly equipped male teachers for one or two scientific branches, 
acceptable results are found. The Latin high schools seem to be better in every 
respect. Of course there are a few exceptionally good English high schools. 
A peculiar feature of the American school system is the development which man- 
ual training has had. It is an acquisition made since the World’s Exposition at 
Philadelphia, and an imitation of the Russian system, which was suggested by Dr. 
Woodward, of St. Louis, and has since spread over the whole Union. Manual train- 
ing is now either given in special, technical, or manual training high schools, which 
are admirable, or has been made an integral part of the course in primary, gram- 
mar, and high schools, as, for instance, in the city of Washington. In the so-called 
manual training high schools, which are a third kind of high school beside the 
English and classical, ten hours a week are devoted to work in the*shops, five to 
drawing, and ten to scientific instruction. 
Imust deny myself the pleasure of entering into the historical development of this 
interesting and important branch of instruction, nor can I state here the psycho- 
logical arguments upon which it is based; but I will state that the growth of man- 
ual instruction as an organic branch of the public pega system and the great 
popularity and progress of Froebel’s educational ideas? (surprising to us as Ger- 
mans, but very significant for America) has led to a complete revolution of didac- 
tics, to the so-called ‘‘new education,” the education “by doing,” in contradistinc-   
10ne observation seems to me worthy of mention. It was made in Wellesley College. Ina class 
consisting of some 20 young ladies studying mathematics, the students showed themselves so well 
acquainted with differential calculus that there could be no question as to their ability to use and 
comprehend it. This visit was made in company of the school superintendent of Berlin, Privy 
Councilor Prof. Dr. Bertram, whose quick observation and expert judgment aided me during a part 
of my journey in the fall of 1893. 
2Dr. Hailmann, superintendent of public schools in Laporte, Ind., has earned a'great and merited 
reputation by introducing Froebel’s ideas, and thus improving the methods of school instruction.

        527 
tion to the old memoriter method. A further result of this instruction “by doing” 
ave the independent exercises of the pupil in experimenting, mentioned before. 
‘These experiments are made, of course, under direction of the teachers in physics 
and chemistry. . 
For the preparation of teachers the States have their normal schools; for that 
of the three learned professions (theology, law, and medicine), divinity, law, and 
medical schools. Very few of these institutions require a college education for 
admission. Many of the medical schools shut one eye, if the candidate for admis- 
sion ‘has scarcely reached a degree of education required for admission to a high 
school. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston is a polytechnicum of 
the first rank. Its president is the renowned political economist, Gen. Francis 
Walker. Besides, there are trade and industrial schools. The Drexel Institute in 
Philadelphia isa very grand institution for art, science, and industry, and is richly 
equipped and well organized. It admits students of both sexes. Drawing and 
modeling—subjects which, though extensively taught in America, are but little 
developed—seem to be very well represented here. The main object of this institu- 
tion for popular culture (this epithet is used in the true sense of the word) is the 
training of teachers; it prepares—(1) Teachers and supervisors of drawing in publi¢e 
and private schools; (2) teachers of science in high schools and academies; (3) 
directors and teachers in physical culture; (4) instructors in manual training; (5) 
instructors in cookery; (6) instructresses in dressmaking and millinery; (7) assist- 
ants in library work, i.e., mostly girls; the employment of women in the lower posi- 
tions in libraries is a very extensive one in America, the land of public libraries. 
The American public libraries are distinguished more than the generous English 
libraries by facilitating and simplifying the use of books for the reading public by 
making the books accessible, by advising and guiding the readers in the selection 
of reading matter, and by making the use of reading rooms as comfortable and 
pleasant as possible. 
For Indians and negroes an excellent institution exists at Hampton, Va., the normal 
and agricultural institute for negroes and Indians. I visited it in the fall of 1890. 
The young Indians of both sexes received here, besides instruction in the common 
school branches and religion, a training in trades, agriculture, female handiwork, 
cooking, tailoring, washing, ironing, etc. The negro children in the Northern States 
are taught together with the white children; in the Southern States, including even 
Maryland and the District of Columbia, they have their special schools. It was 
interesting to hear in a colored high school in Washington a 15-year-old negress 
translate Cicero’s Pro Milone. The colored teacher of Latin, a graduate of Harvard, 
also spoke German fluently. The teacher of physics and chemistry, like the princi- 
pal, a colored man, was a Ph. D., who had first studicd at Harvard, afterwards at 
Heidelberg and Berlin. 
Aside from some institutions established by the Catholic Church and other religious 
communities, no religious instruction is given in American schools. However, it 
can not be said that therefore an atheistic atmosphere prevails in school and society. | 
Nowhere is religious life as active and intense as in America. I do not think, as is_ 
alleged, that this remarkably strong participation in religious life is a consequence 
of the separation of church and state and the exclusion of religious instruction 
from the schools. It is said that because the schools do not indulge in overfeeding 
their pupils with Bible verses and hymns (as is alleged to be the case with us), attend- 
ance at church is better and more voluntary, dictated by the desires of the heart. 
The conditions are altogether different in America. As everywhere in the Anglo- 
Saxon world, so it is, especially in America, that the mind (or should we say an 
aberration of the mind?) which ripened the reformation has again awakened and 
hastens, as Carlyle says, to a search for new forms in which the essential contents of 
Christianity are to be molded. Hence the numerous bequests for pious purposes; 
hence, also, the numerous churches and pulpits well supported by devout and chari- 
  GERMAN CRITICISM OF AMERICAN EDUCATION.

     528 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
tably inclined adherents of different sects; hence, also, the fact that a book: like 
Robert Elsmere, by Mrs. Humphrey Ward, is found everywhere, and has eager 
readers and commentators wherever the English language reaches—and English is 
the universal language which spansthe globe: This same spirit pervades a good part 
of the laboring people. I myself have heard on the commons of Boston and other 
cities on Sunday afternoons, in religious socialistic speeches addressed to all who 
were willing to listen, the ever-recurring idea of a socialistic Utopia that the world 
could not be range unless the kingdom of Jesus were restored in its ora 
form, and its social plans carried out. 
Gymnastics in the primary and grammar schools has only recently found some 
consideration, but since these schools are without gymnastic halls, only calisthenie 
exercises, fashioned after the Swedish system, are given in the class rooms. This is 
made possible by the fact that every pupil has his own desk, and the aisles are wide 
enough for the purpose. The want of gymnastic halls for these elementary schools 
is perceived more generally now than formerly. Many of the high schools and col- 
leges have such halls, which are magnificently equipped with Sargent machines and 
with apparatus for Swedish educational gymnastics. The Sargent machines, so 
called after their inventor, Dr. Sargent, the. director of gymnastics in Harvard, 
are excellent, scientifically planned appliances for the development of strength of 
the different limbs and muscles. The gymnasia, often also used for military exer- 
cises, are rarely without luxuriously arranged bathing establishments and swimming 
basins.!. Many of the gymnasia have a continuous inner gallery used as a running 
path for foot racing. Appliances for rowing likewise belong to the common equip- 
ment of many gymnasia for girls as well as for boys. These halls are frequently used 
between lessons for gymnastics on the apparatus, or tests of strength on the Sargent 
machines. Besides, most schoolhouses of large and middle-sized cities have spacious 
and well-ventilated play halls, which are covered (some are in the basement of the 
schoolhouses) so that the class rooms may be emptied and aired during inclement 
weather. In many institutions, especially in girls’ colleges, anthropometric tables 
are kept in which the growth of the pupils and the increase and decrease in the 
strength of different parts of the body are recorded, which record is renewed and 
corrected after stated periods. This serves as a means for hygienic information and 
instruction concerning correct positions of the body. Every individual table con- 
tains a normal figure in black lines, on which, with colored ink, the figure of the 
body of the particular student is indicated in exact accordance with the measure- 
ments taken. This leads to self-discipline in diet and conduct, and hence is not 
without ethical and educational influence. 
If, despite these partially model appliances for gymnastics, bodily exercises are 
not as well fostered in America as with us, it is owing to the fact that in America, 
as well as in England, open-air games occupy such a prominent place in the educa- 
tion of the young; especially has this been true in America for the last thirty years. 
Baseball, the national game of the Americans, which has much resemblance to the 
English rounders, and is played by nine persons, seven fielders, one pitcher, and one 
catcher, amuses young and old, in village and city, from May till October. Rowing 
and canoeing are diligently practiced; also football, which, however, owing to the 
severe winters, is commonly played in September, October, and November. Also for 
the Canadian game, la crosse, societies have been formed in some cities of the East; 
in 1890 I saw it played in Baltimore. Lawn tennis is equally popular with ladies 
and gentlemen, as in England; cycling (or vicyeling), which is nowhere limited by 
police regulations as in England, is very frequently resorted to by ladies for reeup- 
eration. Angling and fishing, as well as excursions to the wood-covered hills and 
camping under tents, are quite popular sports. For such camping parties, consisting 
of from two to four young people, the White Mountains in New Hampshire seem to 
have a particular attraction.

  GERMAN CRITICISM OF AMERICAN EDUCATION. 529 
A characteristic feature of the American high schools is the fact that the pupils 
are being made acquainted in every branch of study with the accessible literature 
relating to it and receive suggestions for the use of popular scientific works touching 
upon the subject. Works of reference of various kinds are found in great number 
in every high school. The cause of this procedure, especially important in the 
writing of essays on literature and historical subjects, is partly explained by the 
necessity of resorting to these books because of the often very inadequate knowl- 
edge of the teachers, which requires that the pupils be offered reliable material in 
reference books. It is partly explained, also, by the strong desire to educate for 
self-activity and independence; this is a tendency very prominent in English and 
American schools. 
A thing worthy of imitation is the continuous blackboard in American schools, a 
blackboard, either of natural slate or made of slating fluid, attached to the four 
walls, except where the wall is broken by doors and windows. This gives ample room 
to teachers and pupils for blackboard work. Sketches, figures, etc., sometimes in 
artistic perfection, illustrating mathematics, geography, and natural history, can be 
retained on the blackboard for many a day; there is still room left for quotations 
from noted authors, for golden rules of life and proverbs, which may be renewed 
weekly. 
The fact that in the courses of study in colleges such ample opportunity for the 
study of the Spanish language is given appears curious to us Germans. Though 
the well-established relations between the Union and the Latin-American States 
might explain it, it is reasonable to suppose that the recent popularity of Spanish as 
a study stands in close connection with Pan-American desires and aspirations to 
crowd out European nations, especially Germany, from commerce in South America. 
Looked at from a purely commercial standpoint, the study of Spanish has for the 
Germans, at present, a prominent importance. Thorough acquaintance with Spanish 
is fully as important to us as a knowledge of French, Far more important, however, 
is a thorough knowledge of English, the universal language that spreads over the 
whole world. 
Another very excellent institution in some colleges may be mentioned. It is that 
of the sabbatical year, according to which the professors are granted one vacation 
year in every seven years with the provision that they use this year for the continu- 
ation of their own scientific preparation, and for a visit to the Old World in order 
to gather information concerning new methods of instruction. If we had such a 
sabbatical year, though only for teachers of modern languages in secondary schools, 
the instruction in modern languages would be promoted; what a wealth of new, fresh, 
valuable experiences and points of view might be gained for the profession of teach- 
ing, for the education of the young, and for the nation in general! Of course, for the 
American, who draws his salary during this furlough, a voyage to Europe, and a 
sojourn there, does not cause a pecuniary loss; but owing to the low prices of com- 
modities in Germany, compared with the much higher prices of other European coun- 
tries, the German teacher could not possibly live in foreign countries on his salary 
alone. 
The various discrepancies and inefficiencies of the American schools, merely touched 
upon in the foregoing paragraphs, have not remained hidden to the Americans 
themselves. They form subjects of discussion in numerous societies, some of which, 
like the National Educational Association and the Modern Language Association, 
have members throughout the entire Union. They are also fruitful topics of dis- 
cussion in numerous essays of the best American periodicals, especially the Forum, 
the Atlantic Monthly, the North American Review, etc. The recognition of the ineffi- 
ciencies of their educational institutions and the present general enthusiasm for popu- 
lar education, mentioned at the beginning of this report, have led the Americans to 
numerous new experiments for the purpose of elevating the school system of their 
country.

Among the various attempts of this kind, many of which touch upon the work of 
home mission, university extension and college settlements are foremost. The latter 
are in their fundamental ideas a certain renaissance of Christianity, a movement 
toward its early humanitarian aspects. Co]lege settlements are homes maintained 
by students and graduates, especially of women’s colleges, in the darkest and most 
depraved parts of large cities. Young ladies who have passed through college, and 
who have inclination, time, and money, as well as health adequate for this very 
exhaustive work, agree to serve in these homes for several months, Here, by means 
of social entertainments of various kinds, such as games and plays, or by means of 
lending and discussing books, by means of lectures and instruction, visits and furnish- 
ing medicines, etc., the young missionaries try to approach and influence the hearts 
of all classes and ages, especially of children and youths of both sexes in the 
entire neighborhood, the ethical level of which it is the object to raise. ‘The settle- 
ment is a home full of open-hearted and intelligent men or women who approach the 
poor, not as visitants from another world, but as dwellers in the same block or ward, 
finding a pleasure (and it is a real pleasure, not a fictitious one) in the acquaintance 
of their fellow-habitants, and as claiming a share in the life of that quarter of the 
town, and a right to contribute whatever they may in the way of books, music, 
pictures, general information, or mecting rooms and acquaintances, to the well- 
being of the community to which they belong.” The establishment of college settle- 
ments has been copied from England, where the best known settlement is that at 28 
Commercial street, East London, known as Toynbee Hall, founded in 1885. In New 
York I visited the settlement conducted by Dr, Jane Elizabeth Robbins, No. 95. Riv- 
ington street, and also the Neighborhood Guild, 26 Delancey street, conducted by Dr. 
Stanton Coit. 
University extension is a movement on the part of the universities (originally 
Oxford and Cambridge in England) for extending the possibilities of education to 
the great mass of all who live remote from university cities, and to all educated, 
semieducated, and uneducated beyond scholastic age who have a desire for advanc- 
ing their education or are likely to have a desire of that kind awakened in them. 
It is said to be the object of the universities to offer a scientific education not only 
to a limited number of young people blessed more or less with wealth, but also to 
contribute directly or indirectly to the elevation of the intellectual and ethical level 
of the whole nation. The methods for reaching this eminently beneficial object are 
courses of popular scientific lectures given by traveling lecturers, systematically 
arranged, and the habit of absorbing and persistent intellectual occupation resulting 
from practical exercises connected with the lectures. 
Absorbing and lasting interest is the object in view, and to secure this no detached 
lectures are given, but a subject is treated in a course, generally of twelve lectures. 
University instruction, as we understand it, differs from school instruction by never 
exhausting a subject, but acting as a stimulating and enlightening guide in the 
domain of investigation. Thus university extension also will stimulate and en- 
lighten, it will till the soil, sow the seed, and leave the further growth of the plant 
alone, which in its gradual development will fill the whole life of its possessor. 
Since the general spread of the art of reading, an unscrupulous press poisons the 
masses politically, and an ever-growing novel-literature of trash and filth ruins them 
morally; therefore the people who desire to read, and are eager to learn, should be 
furnished with healthful nourishment, or guidance in selecting intellectual food. 
This guidance it is aimed to offer by means of lecture courses and practical exercises 
through university extension. According to the ideas of its promoter, it signifies a 
new stage in the history of mankind—an epoch-forming advance in civilization. In, 
an address delivered November 19, 1890, at Philadelphia, by R. G. Moulton, a dis- 
‘tinguished and successful university extension: lecturer in England, it was said: 
“And this is one of the great revolutions which, when you see them from a suffi- 
cient distance, make up our history, You know, if you go back far enough, there 
 
-P-A-G-E-541

was 2 time when religion itself was regarded as a thing for the few; only the clergy 
were to think on those matters, and the rest were simply to take what the clergy 
gave them. Then there came the great revolution of the Reformation, and the whole 
adult population insisted upon thinking for themselves in religious matters. Again, 
in Europe at least, there was a time when political matters were supposed to be the 
property of a class—a governing class—and the great mass of the nation had simply 
to obey. Then there came the vast political revolutions which have produced 
modern times} the essence of which is that every adult person considers that he has 
an interest in political matters, and a right to act for himself asa citizen of the 
body politic. Happily, we have no revolution this time, but a silent change coming 
over the body of the whole nation—here you will find it clearly marked, there you 
will find it only beginning—but anyhow, when recognized with an historical eye, it 
is only one of the great movements of our history, this tendency of the whole adult 
population to claim higher education, to claim the life education that belongs to 
university teaching, and to claim it as the inheritance of every good citizen. Just 
as in political matters, every adult person claims to be within the constitution, so 
by the new change coming over us every adult person will claim to be within the 
university, in the sense in which I have defined it.” * * * 
Indeed, the influence of university extension in America, to which it was brought 
from England in 1887, has become enormous, especially if we consider that it is not so 
much the acquisition of a certain amount of positive knowledge that is intended, as 
it is diversion of the senses from frivolous occupation, and a training to intellectual 
labor and ethical elevation of the whole man resulting therefrom. The university 
extension of the United States is organized in four centers, Philadelphia, Chicago, 
Chautauqua, and New York. The chief promoters of this magnificent movement 
are Prof. H. B. Adams (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore), Dr. E. W. Bemis 
and President Harper (University of Chicago), Melvil Dewey (secretary of the 
American Library Association), Bishop Vincent, and others. Want of space pre- 
vents entering into details of the management and methods of this beneficial moyve-

  ment. 
In no field of education have the Americans done such prominent pioneer work as 
in the education of girls and women, and of nothing are they prouder; indeed, in 
this respect they entertain the idea that they have left even us Germans far behind, 
though, generally, our system of education appears to them very good. But they 
overlook one thing, namely, that the education offered in our secondary schools for 
girls has a breadth, depth, thoroughness, and excellence which makes it nearly 
equal to an American college education, by which it may be surpassed in-specializa- 
tion, but certainly not in breadth and thoroughness of the knowledge it imparts, 
To that must be added the occupation with music, painting, and drawing, things 
which our girls study outside of the regular course, and in which they often gain 
great skill, or if not that, certainly a commendable comprehension of art in general. 
An American girl when pursuing such studies makes a specialty of it, and devotes 
her whole time to it. The very comprehension of music and art, an essential part 
of a general education, is poorly developed in American girls and women (of course 
I am speaking here of the average degree of perfection found among the educated 
classes), while our girls show great comprehension for art and music which have 
come to them only through great exertion and much practice. Besides, life with us 
offers much more intellectual enjoyment than in America, where nothing is finished, 
where culture is often quite immature, and where culture and barbarism are fre- 
quently found side by side. These intellectual enjoyments, so easily accessible in 
Germany but rarely offered in America, aid essentially in the education of our women. 
Another consideration is that our women are benefited, not only the upper but also 
the middle classes, by the incomparably better developed elementary education, and 
especially by the higher education of the men so generally found in Germany in all 
classes of society. Lastly, we must not forget that with us the percentage of girls
-P-A-G-E-542
    532 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
attending secondary schools is a considerable fraction of the whole female popula- 
tion of the country, and reaches far down into the lower strata of the middle classes. 
On the other hand, the percentage of American girls attending the high school, 
which can not be compared with our secondary schools for girls, is a very small 
fraction of the whole female population of the country. 
Still it must be admitted that in a few of their colleges for women the Americans 
have surpassed us, and that they have happily avoided the dangerous rocks on 
which a higher scientific education for girls is so often wrecked, the danger to 
health, diversion from the duties of domesticity, the disappearance of womanly 
grace, and the growth of the bluestocking. The felicitous arrangement of short 
hours in grammar and high schools makes possible an equally rapid progress of girls 
and boys, short in comparison with the time and exertion required of our boys and 
girls. If we should insist on expecting of our girls the same amount of work we 
now require of the boys, the girls would be physically ruined under the enormous 
burden of work, hence the advocates of classical secondary schools for girls, an exact 
imitation of gymnasia for boys, will fail in their endeavors. The common opinion 
of physicians, educators, mothers, and all ladies who have themselves received a 
college education in America, goes to confirm the statement that the health of girls 
in colleges specially intended for their sex, is not only not endangered but promoted 
by means of wise alternation between intellectual and frequent physical exercises, 
such as walking, cycling, gymnastics, swimming, bathing, rowing. The physical 
condition of college girls is generally better than that of girls of equal age who 
remained at home. : 
These female colleges are munificently equipped with all possible appliances for 
promoting health, comfort of living, and study. They do not lack comfortably 
arranged, spacious workrooms, and well-filled libraries, in which a large number of 
professional journals, some European, is noticeable. These women’s colleges are 
situated in the open country, in beautiful landscapes, have good atmosphere, and are 
usually surrounded by large parks. The cost for room, board, and tuition of a young 
lady in Bryn Mawr, the most expensive of these colleges, is annually $400; in Mount 
Holyoke College it is $250, The colleges have a number of half or partial scholar- 
ships at their disposal. The expenditures of these colleges are defrayed from the 
interest of funds and frequent bequests. The girls are induced to attend these col- 
leges partly by the ambitious desire to held an independent position in life in case of 
nonmarriage. Just as large, or even larger, is the number of those girls belonging 
to the best and wealthiest families who endeavor. to occupy a more elevated position 
in society by means of a higher education, in order to surpass the so-called society 
girls in thoroughness of culture and serious aspirations, for the latter, rushing from 
one frivolous amusement to another, live only for amusement, and thus undermine 
their health. * * * 
All candidates for admission to Bryn Mawr are examined in (1) mathematics, (2) 
Latin, (3) history, English, or science (either in physics or chemistry, botany or 
physiology, or physical geography), and besides, (4) in one of the following groups: 
(a) Greek and French, (b) Greek and German, (c) French and German. 
In all the subjects taught in the college the amount of work required is deter- 
mined a year in advance. The examinations are exclusively in writing; the ques- 
tions are submitted in print and must be answered within a given time. In the 
languages the students are required to translate passages from authors not previously 
studied. Thus, for instance, in June, 1894, the examination in Latin will be on (1) 
Cesar’s Bellum Gallicum, books Ito IV; (2) Cicero, seven orations (Pro Archia poeta, 
De imperio Gn. Pompei, Pro Marcello, and the four orations In Catilinam); (3) Vir- 
gil, Zneid, books Ito IV; grammar and composition; (5)sight reading. * * * 
If the candidate is admitted after having passed this examination, she is required 
to study three years before she can obtain the degree of B. A., and in addition to 
the studies mentioned she must take up, for purposes of general culture, a fourth
-P-A-G-E-543
  
GERMAN CRITICISM OF AMERICAN EDUCATION. 533 
foreign language, trigonometry and stereometry, some branch of natural science and 
philosophy; also a certain group of special branches, such as Greek and Latin, or 
Greek and mathematics, or mathematics and physics, or history and political econ- 
omy, etc., and pass all prescribed semiannual examinations. If she intends to con- 
tinue her studies after having obtained the degree of B. A., she may study another 
year and obtain the degree of M. A. (master of arts). The degree of Ph. D. can not 
be obtained except after the expiration of three years following her degree of B. A. 
This doctor’s degree can be secured only by means of a printed dissertation found 
satisfactory by the faculty, and an oral examination. The college offers many oppor- 
tunities for such advanced learned studies. Special branches are taught there, for 
instance, Sanskrit and comparative philology, the Semitic languages (such as the 
Hebrew, Aramaic, Assyrian, Phoenician, Arabic, Athiopean), Germanic languages 
(this department is conducted by Professor Collitz, of Halle), art and architecture, 
physics, chemistry, biology, etc. 
Dr. Uhlig, editor of Das humanistische Gymnasium, quotes Professor Imelmann, of 
Berlin, who was in Chicago during the World’s Congress of Education. The profes- 
sor stated that he had listened with delight to expressions on the subject of Greek 
in colleges as a conditio sine qua non of the degree of bachelor of arts. Being called 
upon to give his views on American education at length, he wrote to the editor as 
follows: 
“Though there could not have beer a more attentive listener in the whole educa- 
tional congress, assembled during the last week in July, 1893, filling with enthusias- 
tic educators every possible and impossible space of the Art Palace of the young 
gigantic city, Iam not able to reply to your kind request save in the briefest man- 
ner. Though being almost taken off my feet by the profound interest and enthusi- 
asm in the men and the speeches they made, I neglected to make notes on the spot, 
leaving everything to the impressions I should and did receive. Only a most beauti- 
ful impression of the ‘tout ensemble,’a picture in lovely dimensions of those days 
stands before my eyes fresh and encouraging. Yes,encouraging! In one of the fifteen 
sections deliberating at the same time in the different rooms, I not only listened but 
took part in the discussion. It was in the section of higher education; here I heard | 
little or nothing of anticlassic theories and sentiments; certainly much less than was 
expected from the arbitrary views and presentations we get from America. At any 
rate the ‘Trojans’ did not seem to be represented very strongly. After Prof. W. G.' 
Hale had delivered a lecture on the question whether Greek should be made obliga- 
tory for the degree of bachelor of arts, others likewise answered the question in the 
affirmative. The presiding officer desired to hear from the other side; that is, to 
give the opposing opinion a chance to be heard; whereupon a man, not an American, 
spoke from the ‘other side of the ocean, not of the question,’ and expressed his 
Hellenic credo with conviction and emphasis, and loud applause followed him and 
much private commendation. Should we not ere long make the discovery that classic 
education belongs to the things that follow the course of the sun, westward ho?” 
II. Dr. E. Schlee, director of the “ Real-Gymnasium” in Altona, near Hamburg, 
one of the members of the illustrious December conference appointed by Emperor 
William for the purpose of proposing changes in the management and organiza- 
tion of secondary education in Prussia, took part in the International Congress of 
Education in Chicago, and spent some time in studying American schools through 
reports, and seeking information at headquarters. On hisreturn home he published 
the following report in the annual catalogue of his school, which report fully justi- 
fies his Government’s choice in appointing him a delegate to the Congress of Educa- 
tion, where he took part in the discussions of superintendence and secondary 
schools:

  534 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 
By Dr. E. ScHLEE. 
  Director of ‘‘Real-Gymnasium” at Altona. 
Motto: ‘‘ Knowledge and Liberty.” 
  Norr.—This short exposition of the public school system of the United States of 
_ America was suggested by a visit to the World’s Fair at Chicago, which the author 
undertook in an efficial capacity, having been personally invited also to attend the 
Congress of Education held there. Besides observations made at the Exposition and 
personal communications, the sources drawn upon to a greater degree were the very 
ample official reports of the central Bureau in Washington and those of single 
States, together with that of the city of Chicago. To the author’s regret it was 
impossible for him to be present at any recitations, as his journeys happened to be 
undertaken during the two months’ summer vacation. 
* * * The peculiarity of nearly every branch of American civilization has 
originated in the circumstance that it developed on previously unbroken soi], and 
started from an already high degree of culture; in consequence it progresses by zeal- 
ously taking hold of every new acquisition, and in many things rushes ahead of 
Europe, while it is still backward in the perfection of indispensable preparatory 
steps and foundations. Thus, for instance, the system of public reports and statis- 
tics, even in educational matters, is more strongly developed than with us. Each 
state and most cities annually produce whole volumes of reports; teachers in Chi- 
cago, for instance, are obliged continually to hand in written reports to their prin- 
cipals to an extent happily not the case with us as yet. 
The reports of the Bureau of Education are exceedingly valuable, not only for the 
States, which are supplied by them with the dominant ideas for a similar develop- 
ment of its general system of education, but also for foreign pedagogues and poli- 
ticians, to whom they offer richer information than can elsewhere be obtained. In 
our offices, it is true, ample reports and digests are prepared, but they are not pub- 
lished. Especially comprehensive, and prepared with objectivity and deep compre- 
hension of the subject, are statements of the Prussian and German school systems 
by the specialist, Dr. L. R. Klemm; and in the last report the statement of the reform 
movement in Prussian secondary schools, in particular that of the conference at 
Berlin, reported by Charles Thurber, professor in Cornel] University, at Ithaca. 
On the whole, the American system of education still bears an English character, 
in its school organization as well as in management and methods of instruction. 
But the “public school” system is a purely national creation. These institutions, 
called public schools in contradistinction to private schools, and common schools in 
opposition to select or denominational schools, are almost similarly governed in all 
States of the Union. ae 
They comprise the lower and higher schools and have three groups of grades, the 
primary, grammar, and high schools, each generally requiring four years, The first 
two groups of classes, the primary and grammar schools together, form the elemen- 
tary schools, corresponding on the whole to our elementary or people’s schools, with 
asimilar difference between city and rural schools found in Germany. Cities and 
counties are divided into school districts, and each district has its school. In cities 
the primary and grammar schools are separate, and both are divided into classes 
according to annual or semiannual courses; as with us, in the country, as a rule, all 
children of a stated age are together in one class room. In cities and the larger 
counties, educational affairs are administered by school boards. 
The support of public schools.—No tuition fees are paid in any public school of the 
United States, not even in the high school. The expenses are chiefly defrayed by a 
general (or State) and local school tax; a small portion is met by endowments and 
   
-P-A-G-E-545
GERMAN CRITICISM OF AMERICAN EDUCATION. 535 
  proceeds derived from the part of the public land set aside for school purposes. In 
1890, the entire costs were estimated at $143,110,218, toward the payment of which 
the local school tax contributed $97,000,000, from the State governments came more 
than $26,000,000, irreducible funds almost $8,000,000, and other sources $12,000,000. 
The school tax is levied as a property tax on all inhabitants without regard to their 
taking advantage of the public schoolsor not. The revenue derived from the State 
tax is divided among all districts proportionally to the number of pupils, and thus a 
proper adjustment is effected between poor and rich districts. This is the only pos- 
sible way for the South to have obtained schools in the poor districts settled by 
negroes. This general diffusion of education even over the whole South is the most 
commendable feature in the development of the American educational system. The 
Commissioner, with justifiable pride, draws attention to the fact that, in these States 
in which in 1870 not a single public school, existed, now every child has the oppor- 
tunity of acquiring at least the elements of education free of cost. In the Southern 
States the State government necessarily lends much greater assistance; in those 
localities it amounts to 52 per cent, exceeded in the Northern States by the local tax, 
which alone amounts to 70 per cent. Even here, as with us, the State governments 
during late rs have increased their share in the support of schools; in Pennsyl- 
vania, for instance, the State paid $2,000,000 in 1890, and $5,000,000 in 1892. 
The cost of all public schools, elementary and high schools taken together, 
amounted to $2.24 per capita of the population; in Prussia the per capita was 6.50 
marks, which, considering the comparative purchasing power of money, makes the 
costs about the same. Still, the amount in the more cultured States is necessarily 
greater; in California and Colorado, $4 per head. For America, too, an additional 
amount would have to be included for private schools and for colleges, as these cor- 
respond to the higher grades of our secondary schools. The general average cost of 
every pupil is $17.22, but the extremes differ widely; the largest being $43 in Colo- 
rado, and the smallest $3.38 in South Carolina. i 
Education of the colored race.—The position of the “colored race” differs in the 
schools of the North and the South. In the North, where they are few in number, 
colored and white children go to the same school. In the former slave States, where 
negroes constitute altogether 32 per cent, and in some localities even the majority of 
the population, asharply drawn dividing line separates the schools. The white peo- 
ple of the South consent to only a very low local school tax; consequently, schools for 
the colored race, especially those in the country, are as yet little developed. Opin- 
ions on the capacity of the negro for education are most contradictory, But the 
colored race must have colored teachers, just as their communities have colored 
preachers, officers, and physicians. In 1890, therefore, no fewer than 39 normal 
schools, 24 theological seminaries, 71 high schools, and 22 colleges and universities 
had been founded for the benefit of the colored race. The colored male and female 
students of all advanced institutions taken together, numbered 25,540. The colored 
male graduate is said to have a preference for the pulpit because he has innate incli- 
nation and talent for preaching; the colored female graduate is said to give the first 
preference to preaching, the second to teaching. e 
Private and parochial schools.—In accordance with American principles of govern- 
ment, broad spheres of social life, subordinate to State jurisdiction in European 
countries, are left altogether open to the disposal of individuals; we can not but 
wonder that schools should to so great an extent be under State and municipal juris- 
diction, and that proportionally there are so few private schools; 87.9 per cent of 
the pupils belong to public schools; only 12.1 per cent to private, including parochial 
schools. 
The majority of private schools are select, i.e., for the well-to-do classes who do 
not care to send their children to public schools, They adopt the same plan of 
teaching as in public schools, and are mostly well equipped; they generally have a 
gymnasium, which common or public schools lack, and devote some time to games,     
   
-P-A-G-E-546
    536 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
and in some cases, to military exercises also, as models in the Chicago Exposition 
showed. In other respects, their value differs. Their relation to State supervision 
is not yet defined. In the well-to-do North they are more numerous than in the 
South. 
Parochial schools form another category. In a certain sense they are opposed to 
public schools. In America the line of separation between church and state is well 
defined; religion is looked upon by the State as a purely private matter. As a con- 
sequence, public schools not only exclude religious instruction, but reject even 
every local relation to a church organization. This kas gone so far that the use of a 
schoolroom for religious instruction outside of class hours has been prohibited by 
law; and where Catholic children exceed in number, Catholic sisters have been for- 
bidden to wear the religious garb in the class room, and to be called sisters. In this 
respect, however, the States have different customs. In New England, the Puritan- 
Presbyterian spirit has been preserved; in Massachusetts it is generally prescribed 
that daily instruction should begin with prayer and the reading aloud of a chapter 
of the Bible; however, children must be excused from participating, if their fathers 
so request. Four years ago a movement, which has since widely spread, started from 
the fact that in Wisconsin two Protestant teachers began instruction by reading aloud 
a chapter from the Bible, to which Catholic parents raised objections. The supreme 
court of the State declared the former to be illegal, upon which a National League 
for the Protection of American Institutions was formed; and the Bureau of Educa- 
tion investigated the relations of church and state in the chief countries of Europe, 
and collected all information appertaining to the subject from the principals of 
schools in the United States. 
The different Protestant communities are satisfied with the existing order, as far 
as it goes; they have founded parochial schools, and try to replace religious instruc- 
tion in day schools by Sunday schools. But a large number of children grow up 
without any religious instruction, so much so that professors of colleges complain of 
the ignorance among their adult students in Bible history and the Sacred Scriptures. 
The Catholic Church, on the contrary, resolutely opposes the existing order; 
12,000,000 Catholics are against the public school system.” Only in a few South- 
ern States where Catholics predominate have satisfactory concessions been made to 
the Catholic Church—either by giving assistance from the school fund, as in New 
Mexico and Georgia, or appointing sisters and Christian brothers to the position of 
teachers in the public schools. Where Catholics are in the minority, but numerous 
enough to have their own schools, Catholic schools are maintained exclusively at the 
expense of the church. While the educational exhibition of public schools of the 
United States was divided according to States, Catholic schools had a particular 
exhibition divided according to archdioceses. Catholics demand either exemption 
from the school tax or a corresponding support of their schools from the school fund. 
The renowned Archbishop Ireland thus formulated his request: Either support of 
the denominational schools for every pupil who passes an examination, or the appoint- 
ment of denominational teachers who are to be allowed to impart religious instruc- 
tion outside of school hours. * * * These relations show that a complete sepa- 
ration between church and state does not overcome all difficulties, and that the United 
States still have contentions in prospect with the Roman Catholic Church. 
Public schools differ from the German-evangelical parochial schools in one other 
particular. The public schools are to be the nursery of the idea of national union; 
and the individual character of the American nation and “all the different nation- 
alities are to become imbued with the thoroughly American spirit.” But the Ger- 
man parochial schools have some children who can not speak English fluently, and 
cultivate the German language from religious interests, without, however, neglect- 
ing instruction in English. For this reason, they are attacked and unfavorably 
judged by the Know Nothing party. The school board of the State of Massachusetts 
points to them as a great danger, because private schools nurture the spirit of caste,
-P-A-G-E-547

widen the abyss between rich and poor, and engender labor troubles. But the fol- 
lowing words express the actual tendency: ‘‘Shall we remain a people of many lan- 
guages? Without a common language we can not become a nation.” In Illinois 
and Wisconsin, too, the question was agitated in a lively manner, and in 1889 it was 
legally declared that parochial schools were not to be publicly recognized,' and that 
their pupils should be obliged to attend a public school sixteen weeks out of the 
year. Whoever has been in America knows how groundless the fear is, that German 
could assert itself as a second national language, like the French in Canada. Those 
demands were declared unjust and absurd not only by the New York School Journal, _ 
but in the Yale Review, and the law had to be revoked. The culture of the German 
language in school and church serves only temporarily for the preservation of the 
best individualities of German systems by which life in America is influenced, to its 
advantage of course. 
In another way, too, the German language in the schools is a subject of dissen- 
sion. Not only German, but French or Spanish is optionally taught in some cities for 
a few hours in public elementary schools, when a large number of inhabitants justi- 
fies their introduction. Knowledge of German is coveted in the North Central States, 
and not alone by the lately arrived German settlers. In Chicago, in 1892, German 
was studied by 39,462 pupils, of whom only 17,512 were of German parentage. But 
the principals, none of whom bear German names, as so many of the teachers do, 
alleged that the elementary course was disturbed by the study of German; the 
school board, with few exceptions Americans or Irishmen, opposed German for 
national reasons, hence the suspension of instruction in German was as good as 
decided upon last year in Chicago, although nearly half of the inhabitants of the 
city are Germans. 
Attendance at schools and compulsory education.—American statistics satisfactorily 
show that in the United States proportionately more children attend school, or 
rather, more names are on the call roll, compared with the population, than in any 
other country of the world, even Prussia; 14,010,533 children are on the rolls of 
the elementary schools, whereas in Prussia only 5,390,860 of the required age are 
entered at school. Accordingly in America the proportion is 1 pupil to 4.4 inhabi- 
tants; in Prussia only 1 to 5.5. There must be a mistake in the statistics, caused 
either by a wrong calculation of the terms, or by duplicate enumeration necessary 
on account of changes of school, and having separate lists for the summer and win- 
ter sessions. The Prussian statistics, perfectly reliable, state that in 1891 only 945 
children missed attendance for insufficient causes. It can not be attributed to the 
fact that America has proportionately more children; Germany is generally acknowl- 
edged to be a prolific country; whereas it is a well-known fact that families of the 
Anglo-Saxon race have few children, and the official report records a not only rela- 
tive but absolute decrease in the number of children in the north Atlantic States. 
When we consider the crowded population of the large cities and the still undefined 
relations in the South and West, we are justified in presupposing a reversed propor- 
tion. Still more probable is this when we see the hosts of 10 and 12 year-old boys 
running about selling newspapers, and almost a certainty when we read that in 1892 
‘the governor of the State of New York, for instance, deplores the fact that ‘“ thou- 
sands of children grow up without any education.” The report of the school board 
of Chicago for the same year numbered 191,180 children between 6 and 14 years of 
age, of whom only 157,743 were entered on the rolls, Other and still louder com- 
plaints may be exaggerated. ‘ 
Theoretically a kind of compulsory education does exist in the United States; the 
first measures to carry it into effect were taken as early as 1852 by Massachusetts, a 
State considered an authority on the development of education. It became general 
in Massachusetts only in 1878, and now exists in 27 States; in the South it is still 
unknown, and is elsewhere opposed on the grounds that it creates new transgres- 
  
  
(Unless tho instruction was conducted in the English language.—Ep.

    538 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
sions, limits the liberty of parents, gives the Government new’ power, and is 
altogether un-American, that is, opposed to the free institutions of America. But 
the rationale with which it was introduced meets this opposition in a thoroughly 
republican manner: ‘It is one of the fundamental laws of the State to compel 
parents to give their children an education which qualifies them to become citizens 
of a free State.” 
But its extent and the way it is carried into effect make compulsory education in 
America entirely different from that in Germany. First of all, much more time is 
spent at school in Germany. In America, a week has only five school days. High 
schools and most of the elementary schools of large cities have about as many school 
weeks as in Germany; but rural, and especially Southern schools, have not nearly so 
many. The official report for the whole of America averages one hundred and thirty- 
four school days to a year; the north Atlantic States with one hundred and sixty-six 
and the south Central States with eighty-cight days are the extremes. Four years 
[of two hundred days each] are given as the average time of attendance; the long- 
est time being seven years in Massachusetts and the shortest two and a half years 
in a few Southern States. The law of compulsory education in no wise obligates 
for the whole time; eight years (from the sixth to the fourteenth or from the eighth 
to the sixteenth) have been decided upon for the course of elementary schools; still 
in most States 8 to 14 years of age are regarded as the limits of obligatory attend- 
ance, and the minimum attendance is required only for a limited number of weeks, 
twelve to sixteen, during a year. 
The execution of the law makes even this limited compass illusory. Ilegal non- 
attendance is punished by a fine of $5 to $20. But if parents are too poor to clothe 
their children decently the punishment clause of the law in many States is expressly 
declared inapplicable. Naturally most cases of nonattendance occur in poor fami- 
lies, for whom special provision has been made in charity or truant schools. These 
are exceptions, however. New York and Massachusetts are provided to a small extent 
only with these schools. Here and there the police do not sufficiently aid the school 
commission, consequently the reports of most States speak of the law as “a dead 
letter.” School commissioners and superintendents prefer to do away with the power 
of punishment altogether, and apply moral means only. What can be effected in 
large cities in this respect, especially with incomplete rosters, is, of course, insufli- 
cient; but what has been accomplished in many places is worthy of recognition and 
may be looked upon as admirable proof of self-administration. For this purpose a 
special commission of citizens, truancy committee, or committee on compulsory edu- 
cation, has been formed. These obtain the lists of truants from schools, and endeavor 
to influence the parents either personally or by means of officials. In 1892 they 
made 12,906 investigations in Chicago; in 1,356 cases they could do nothing on account 
of the indifference of the parents and incorrigibility of the children; 7,592 children 
were taken back to school for a time, and 1,633 were induced to go to night schools 
at least. In New York the commission has 12 officials to execute the law. During 
1889-90, 16,526 cases were carefully investigated and 3,590 truants taken back to 
school, many of them more than once. 
It seems strange to us to see the attempt of healing homeopathically the malady 
of truancy, i.e., irregular attendance (or ‘‘ playing hooky”); but that is being 
tried in other places besides Chicago. It is prescribed that as soon as a pupil misses 
two whole or four half days without permission within four weeks, the parents are 
notified in writing; if the child has missed six half days he is expelled from school. 
He can not be readmitted until the father has appeared before the inspectors and 
promised regular attendance. In the last year 3,670 children were thus temporarily 
suspended, while only 164 were suspended for bad conduct, A child can not change 
schools ad libitum; each child must attend the school within its own district. 
According to personal information these means are said to be very effective; of course, 
only with parents who attach any value to education. In many cities, to lay hold of

   children running about in the streets during school hours has been tried, but many 
courts have declared it to be illegal, as there is no warrant for arrest. 
In late years laws have been passed to restrict the employment of children in fac- 
tories while they should be attending school; the employment of vhildren in factories 
is now made dependent upon permission granted by the school commissioner. In 
1892 this permission was given in Chicago to 1,077 children, aged between 10 and 13 
years; 173 of them had been abandoned by their parents. 
The result is that reports on attendance are much more modest than those on 
enrollment. Only 64 per cent of all pupils enrolled really go to school; on an aver- ° 
age a pupil attends school only eighty-six days out of the one hundred and thirty- 
four average school days. In just appreciation of the better conditions in Germany, 
the official report remarks that no class in that country is uneducated; no ragged or 
begging child is seen on the streets of its cities, as is the case in America. 
In regard to the short time of attendance at rural schools, Americans content 
themselves with the fact that the children after all learn to read, and»that news- 
papers serve as «means for further progress in education. Americans, and especi- 
ally the American laborer, reads the papers much more regularly than wedo. Every- 
one reads his paper early in the morning, whether in railroad or street cars; the 
laborer reads his during dinner hour or of an evening while resting on the benches 
of the squares and parks. It is very desirable that these papers offer something 
better than their usual spicy, piquantly illustrated articles on scandals. 
Coeducation.—Coeducation is nota general, but an extensively found, peculiarity of 
American public schools. It is not as with us the custom only in primary and rural 
schools, but in the city grammar and high schools as well. Neither are the sexes 
separated in the normal schools, colleges, or universities. In Chicago coeducation 
is general; in Boston and New York the sexes are educated together and separately. 
It was a strange sight for us to see even in photographie representation 12, 13, and 
16 year-old boys and girls sitting side by side, or standing in mixed rows for calis- 
thenics or wand exercises. It must be remarked that, where instructed together, 
they have separate seats; as a rule the teacher is a woman, evenin calisthenics. All 
other apartments, including playgrounds, are not shared by boys and girls. The 
advantages of coeducation are not undisputed; strong objections to it have twice 
been advanced from Boston. Ten years ago Dr. Clarke revived the much mooted 
question whether the better classes of American women -are good housewives and 
mothers. The Commissioner of Education compared reports from 300 large and 
small cities, and all were in favor of mixed schools. He then recommended them for 
this reason: ‘‘ Education should prepare us for our future life; and if we must live 
together, separate education means changing the natural order of the human house- 
hold.” 
Later on, Dr. Philbrick asserted that the particular form of education adapted to ~ 
each sex could not be easily applied in coeducation. This objection could be met by 
the commissioner with the answer that he had had no experience in mixed schools, 
and in regard to hygiene, statistical investigation showed only favorable results. 
The cncouraging experiences of Norway and Finland in regard to morals were 
reported at the same time with a reminder of the unsatisfactory effect of convent 
education in France. 
‘The author was assured by a teacher, well informed on this subject, that coeduca- 
tion exerted a favorable influence on deportment, mutual behavior, and discipline. 
Germany perhaps chooses the right medium between France and America; but when 
we consider how healthy, as a rule, the companionable intercourse between children 
of families friendly to each other is, we need not look upon the American plan as 
hazardous for us, especially in small places, where outward circumstances make a 
union desirable, and as long as it does not interfere with the distinct aims of instruc- 
tion for each.

   540 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Discipline is not so strict as in Germany; formerly corporal punishment was in 
vogue, but it is now generally forbidden. Incarceration does not seem to be cus- 
tomary. Where admonition fails, the only means employed are suspension from 
school or transfer to another school. The principal has a right to suspend a pupil 
for a month; the superintendent for a term. The American method of instruction, 
on account of the frequent reciting of single pupils, gives rise to much temptation 
for disturbance and confusion, about which many complaints are heard. 
Subjects of instruction.—The studies of the public elementary schools in cities are, 
in the main, the same all over the country; but the number of hours devoted to each 
study varies greatly. Most time is given to reading, as the contents of the readers 
are used as matter of instruction. Those used in the intermediate classes chiefly 
treat of natural sciences; those in the upper classes of history. Half of all the time 
is occupied by the study ot the English language, reading, orthography, grammar, 
and writing. Complaints are numerous because spelling takes up so much time. 
Technical grammar is studied only during the last two or three years. Very great 
importance is attached to arithmetic, to which five to six hours a week are allotted. 
The course formerly included commercial and stereometric arithmetic; but it has 
been curtailed from time to time. Algebra is begun in the eighth grade in a few 
cities only; geometry is rarely taught except in the high school. The natural sci- 
ences are included from the first to the eighth grade. Instruction is demonstrative 
and practical, not systematic, and according to present plans anticipates the develop- 
ment of the child in years. It comprises botany and zoology, geography and astron- 
omy, meteorology, physics, and the elements of chemistry. Great stress is laid upon 
physiology and hygiene, the discussion of the circulation of the blood, the bones, 
muscles, and nerves; the brains of brutes and man are compared as early-as in the 
second grade, and the comparison continues during two or three terms, always, of 
course, according to practical points of view. 
Geography is studied at least to the same extent as in Germany, two or three hours 
aweek. History is limited to that of the United States, the short period of which 
permits a comprehensive course, even by devoting only a few hours a week to its 
study. In late years special study of the civil government of the United States and 
of the particular State in question has been introduced in connection with the closely 
related study of history, the different departments of the law being thoroughly 
expounded from their historic foundation. This is probably the reason why in 
America the mass of the people have such evident respect for the legal status of the 
land. It seems “American” to us that in a model course (that of Philadelphia) even 
the salaries of offices have been included. 
Drawing and singing are included in the course to about the same extent as with 
us; physical culture, particularly calisthenics, too, but the necessary equipments for 
physical culture are wanting. 
Finally, the study of temperance, essentially American, is legally prescribed in 34 
States, except in the most Southern States. In 29 States no teacher receives a certifi- 
cate of appointment unless he passes the examination in physiology and temperance. 
In this case, too, State reason (Staatsraison) instead of humanity dictates the rule: 
“A vigorous mind in a strong body can do more for the State than a weak one. 
Public schools are maintained by the State; hence the State can demand that what 
is to its benefit shall be taught initsschools.” The appropriate chapters of the text- 
books on physiology and hygiene form the basis of instruction. At the examination 
for promotion, questions to be answered by girls and boys 10 years old are, for instance 
“How can we.prove that nicotine is a poison? Why are cigarettes particularly 
poisonous? Is alcohol nutritious? Under what names is alcohol drunk? What is 
the effect of drinking beer?” etc. It must be remarked, however, that this study 
meets with decided opposition; on the one hand, it is declared useless as long as most 
teachers are not able to instruct otherwise than by allowing the pupil to memorize 
what is found in the text-book; on the other hand, it is considered an error in peda- 
gogics to acquaint children with vices as yet foreign to their thoughts.

  GERMAN CRITICISM OF AMERICAN EDUCATION. 541 
High schools ov secondary education.—High schools, following immediately upon 
grammar schools, also require for the most part four years of attendance. They 
admit the pupils who have left the elementary schools with a certificate, or can pass 
an examination for admission. Their course has a rather more scientific character, 
and includes even the beginning of foreign languages. 
Any positive statistical comparison with the Prussian secondary schools, despite 
the rich materials furnished by both sides, can not be carried out, for the American 
high schools correspond to the higher grades of our so-called middle schools, our 
higher schools for girls, and the intermediate classes of our high schools combined. 
The number of their pupils, nevertheless, is proportionally smaller than that of the 
Prussian schools. If we consider boys only, and contrast a fairly exact estimate of 
the pupils of the intermediate classes of our high schools and the highest classes of 
our middle schools with American high schools, the average in America is 1 high 
school pupil to 736 inhabitants; in Prussia, 1 to 586. These high schools are very 
different from the well-defined secondary schools of Germany; they include every 
school, even the smallest, whose course of study goes beyond that of the grammar 
school. Thus there are 2,526 public with 202,963 students, and 1,632 private high 
schools with 74,931 students, averaging 3.6 teachers and 80 pupils. 
But the most noteworthy fact—here, for the first time, we touch upon the most 
important peculiarity of all American schools—is that the number of girls in the 
high schools far exceeds the number of boys. There are 116,351 girls and only 85,451 
boys. What is more characteristic still, is that ofthe proportionately small number 
of graduates there are twice as many girls as boys, namely, 14,190 against 7,692. 
Boys enter business very soon, in which a higher education is considered of no value, 
while the daughters of well-to-do parents attend the higher institutions of learning 
for the sake of higher culture, and girls who are not so well situated need higher 
education to practice an independent vocation, particularly that of teaching. 
The high school course includes, besides English and literature, Latin, Greek, 
French, German (Spanish, too, here and there), algebra, geometry, physics, chem- 
istry, universal history, drawing, and singing. The courses of the different schools 
are by no means the same, and indefinite on account of the studies which are left 
optional. High schools are designed only partly to prepare for colleges and univer- 
sities; many pupils leave after a brief attendance. In the year 1889-90, as stated 
before, 85,451 boys and 116,351 girls attended the public high schools; during that 
year 7,692 boys and 14,190 girls left school with a diploma. In all classes together, 
14,969 took the classical and 14,320 the scientific course te prepare themselves for 
study at universities. To meet the different ends in view, the course is shaped to*be 
a little more classical, or a little more scientific than the others, or simply offers a 
general English education. In larger institutions these different courses are com- 
bined. Convinced of possessing the universal language, ‘‘the language of the world,” 
Americans do not attach as much importance to the study of foreign languages as 
we do. The study of no modern foreign language is obligatory. In the scientific 
course only one foreign language is required, it being Latin, German, or French. In 
the classical course Latin is obligatory; the other languages are optional. Greek is 
taught only in the two or three higher classes, the other languages in all four grades. 
Four or five hours are devoted to each foreign language a week. Occasionally, single 
studies, such as calculus, trigonometry, history, physiology, and bookkeeping, are 
optional. The official report of the year 1889-90 gives the following statement: Latin 
was studied by 34 per cent of all the pupils; Greek by 3 per cent; French by 5.8 per 
cent; German by 10.5 per cent; algebra by 45 per cent; geometry by 21 per cent; © 
physics by 22 per cent; chemistry by 10 per cent, and general history by 27 per cent. 
These figures do not give a true idea of existing relations, as not all the studies are 
taught in every one of the four grades, and the whole number of pupils is included 
in the calculations made. The proportion between the numbers of male and female 
pupils in the participation in these studies corresponds almost exactly to the pro-
-P-A-G-E-552
  542 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
portion of the sum total of pupils, from which the remarkable fact is deduced that 
in America about twice as many girls as boys learn Latin, 41,633 against 28,788. But 
in Greek, which is studied by about one-eighth the number of those studying Latin, 
the number of boys is twice as great as that of girls. 
The higher private schools (academies, seminaries, institutes, colleges) have on 
the whole the same organization; they have about the same number of male and 
female pupils. So far as their self-assigned task of preparing for colleges and univer- 
sities is concerned, they stand higher than public schools. For some time uni- 
versity-colleges have been gradually raising their standard for admission in Latin 
and Greek, so that it is difficult for public high schools, with their broader but less 
profound education, to meet the requirements; these preparatory schools limit their 
course accordingly to classical languages and mathematics. The division of public 
high schools into a classical and a scientific course meets with decided opposition 
from the advocates of a uniform system similarly applied to all schools. The corre- 
lation of these schools with the universities—in other words, secondary education 
with superior education—is not as yet as definitely arranged as with us. 
There is no doubt that the fundamental idea of the strictly uniform, or common, 
system is in the main correct. Americans, not hindered by any existing conventional 
order of society, could intelligently arrange their schools according to pedagogical 
and political ideas. Those thoroughly acquainted with the subject readily acknowl- 
edge the superiority of German schools in other respects, but always revert to, 
“But our system is better.” The elementary school appropriates entirely too much 
time. Not to begin instruction in foreign languages until the fifteenth year must 
stunt, or seriously retard, the success of its study, the more so if more than one 
language be begun at the same time. Just because the right to one year’s service 
in the army (with us a great inducement to secondary study) does not cut a figure in 
the calculation, and because aspiration for higher'studies alone induces to entrance 
to the high schools, it would be better not to keep the ambitious back on account of 
the others, but rather to begin the high school course at about the twelfth year 
of age. 
        The Commissioner of Education justly remarks that in German gymnasia the study 
of ancient languages is begun so early—at 9 years—that pupils who attend the higher 
burgher schools find a barrier in their way if they intend to go to the university. 
The want of an easy transition to higher education is a serious error of the German 
system. The right mean in this case, as has been said, would be found between 9 
and 15, 
Furthermore, a definite course of study and uniformity of education must neces- 
sarily be disturbed by the introduction of too many optional studies. A division 
into two essentially different courses is based upon the necessities of the case, and is 
found among all civilized nations; we may even undertake a tripartition; but in 
these courses the plan of instruction should be uniform and positively defined. 
Otherwise, as was affirmed by Americans, it is a difficult task to arrange the time- 
table early enough. 
American teachers who have a thorough knowledge of German schools have 
expressed the opinion that the graduates of high schools are three years behind the 
German graduates in the amount of knowledge acquired. The causes assigned for this 
are: (1) The difficult English orthography; (2) the complicated arbitrary weights 
and measures; (3) the shorter terms or school year; (4) the want of professional 
teachers. The causes may also be traced to the organization we have discussed. 
The opinion of another American teacher is probably more to the point. According 
to him, ‘‘the American public school can learn very little from the higher burgher 
schools of Europe, but American higher schools can learn a great deal from foreign 
universities and secondary schools leading up to them. What they do know they 
have learned from Europe.” What remains for Americans to do is to decide upon 
correct fundamental principles and act accordingly. One of the most important 
   
-P-A-G-E-553
    
GERMAN CRITICISM OF AMERICAN EDUCATION. 543 
causes lies in the method of instruction and the qualification of teachers, closely 
related with one another, which we are about to consider. 
Methods and text-books.—The American method of instruction, having taken the 
French and English mechanical memorizing for its model, differs essentially from 
the German. It aims not at comprehending and mastering a subject through the 
understanding, but at the acquisition of a complete presentation through the mem- 
ory. Consequently instruction is defined less by the teacher than by the text-book, 
which is learned almost by heart. Most of the time is taken up by daily questions 
and answers and marks are given for the recitation. The book contains a number 
of questions with answers attached for recitation. Examinations for promotion in 
class, as well as teachers’ examinations, consist, for the most part, of a number of 
such questions and answers, so that with diligent application and a good memory 
even an inferior mind ¢an easily pass them. Be the books never so good, such 
instruction will hardly lead to the development of the intellect and to a free mastery 
of the subject. The stacks of pupils’ work at the Exposition in Chicago contained 
excellent work in geography and the natural sciences, especially physiology; the 
explanatory drawings were particularly good and appropriate, but the finished form, 
and at times the almost identical wording, betrayed that they were chapters of the 
text-book committed to memory. American teachers are by no means ignorant of 
this deficiency in their method. Many objections have been advanced in different 
reports, but the method is a natural outgrowth of the whole school system. In cases 
where schools or a few teachers have adopted the German method they and their 
pupils appear at a disadvantage at inspections and examinations arranged accord- 
ing to the text-book method. Naturally the drawback is more evident in higher 
than in elementary schools. Generally the teachers have no scientific command of 
their subject, and in their dependence on the text-book do not distinguish between 
essentials and subordinate facts. According to the Massachusetts report, many 
teachers of geometry are dissatisfied with the memorizing method. 
The Commissioner of Education evidently favors the German method; but he 
tries to bring out the good points of the American too; and, as he likes to philoso- 
phize, he endeavors to connect it with the national character. ‘‘The text-book 
method,” says he, “ offers decided advantages for facilitating instruction. By exact- 
ing the acquisition of the contents of the book it becomes easier for the teacher to 
occupy the pupil’s time regularly at home. The pupil does apply the memory more 
than the higher intellectual faculties; but then, he can be made accountable for this 
mechanical work much more easily than for work done by means of the reasoning 
power; moreover, the mechanical work is a kind of intellectual discipline and exer- 
cise for the will. The less gifted pupils may fare better than in Germany; for what 
is acquired without being understood at the time can always be applied later.” 
Even in memorizing grammar (overcome by us at least in principle) he discovers an 
advantage which the eulogist of a formal education attained by Latin grammar 
might turn to account. The positiveness of the rules, many exceptions, numerous 
Jong paradigms and queer idioms are of course only a meager exercise of the intellect; 
but it is also a discipline of the will, peculiarly adapted to accustom one to the 
observation and discreet consideration of the rights and privileges of our fellow- 
citizens, and to equitable assertions of personal rights. A superstitious respect for 
their orthography obliges English-speaking nations to memorize mechanically, 
which, ‘on the other hand, influences all that rise from a state of perfect ignorance 
‘toa conservative way of thinking. The full scope of intellectual freedom which 
the German youth enjoys at school counteracts, so to speak, the outward dependence 
on the Government, which in its surveillance, like Providence, surrounds the citizen 
as with a wall. 
The text-book plays an important part in school administration, too. Its intro- 
duction is generally decided upon by the school board, who are also instrumental in 
purchasing it. Great diversity, however, prevails in this respect. The greatest    
 
-P-A-G-E-554
    544 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93, 
liberty is allowed in Alabama, where every teacher has his own text-book, and intro- 
duces it. “According to which text-book do you teach?” is the most important 
question leading to his appointment. It is said that in some States its use is depend- 
ent upon the rings formed by booksellers. California goes to the other extreme. 
That State controls not only the selection but the introduction and even the manu- 
facture and sale of text-books. As ourown management seems to be inclined in this 
direction, it may be remarked that many objections are raised to it in America. At 
least a free competition in the making of text-books is to be desired. In Chicago 
the school board and booksellers agree to a contract in which the price and finish of 
the books is defined. Every alteration in the text-beok is dependent upon the 
approval of the board. 
In many Northern States the text-book is either loaned or given to the pupil free 
of charge. The expenses in Massachusetts have thereby been increased about 
$400,000. The advantages and disadvantages of this custom are being much disputed 
throughout the Union. 
Male and female teachers.—If in every office the chief factor is the man, and in school 
the teachers, we have come to the weakest point in the American school system— 
professional teachers are wanting. That is to say, that most teachers are deficient 
in the requisite scientific and pedagogic preparation for their vocation. The greatest 
number are women, and comparatively few make a profession of teaching. 
According to the American way of looking at things, no importance is attached 
to the technical preparation for occupations and vocations or professions. Profes- 
sions are changed according to advantages or opportunities. In annual reports 
we repeatedly meet with complaints of the fact that the teachers, men and women, 
have little or no normal or scientific education, and that they must be appointed 
without regard to the necessary knowledge and pedagogic preparation. 
At a superficial glance America does not seem to lack normal schools and semi- 
naries. Although the oldest seminary was founded (in Massachusetts, at Lexington, 
of Revolutionary fame) as late as 1838 there are now 135 public and 43 private normal 
schools in the United States, numbering, collectively, three years ago, 34,440 pupils; 
proportionately more than in Prussia, which two years ago numbered only 10,836 
normal students, not including those of the private normal schools. But the differ- 
ence is reversed by firmness of purpose and a fixed order. Whereas in Prussia all 
normal school students, about 3,600 a year, graduate after having taken the entire 
course; in America, in 1890, only 5,237 passed through all the classes. This number 
lacks about 2,000 in proportion -to the number in Prussia. On account of frequent 
resignations, the yearly demand for teachers in America is astonishingly great, one- 
third of the number needed annually can scarcely be met by the normal schools. 
Massachusetts has the best provisions for a normal education, nevertheless in 1892 
only 3,267 out of the 10,965 teachers actively engaged had graduated from normal 
schools; a further number of 792 had attended a normal school for some period of 
time. The others had in one way or another prepared themselves to pass the 
teachers’ examination. As with us different degrees of diplomas are obtained in the 
examination, so in America teachers are qualified for only from two to four years, 
after which time they must pass another examination. The reporter from Massa- 
chusetts consoles himself with the fact that now 80 per cent of all public schools are 
under professional supervision, and that the school inspector can give assistance to 
the teachers. Such is the state of affairs in the Northern States. In the Southern 
States it is still more unfavorable. 
Teachers of high schools have, as a rule, graduated from high schools; and for the 
most part have for a time attended a college, a university, or a normal school before 
taking the teachers’ examination. Generally speaking, however, the situation is 
about the same with them as it is with those of the lower schools. 
Not only in our judgment, but according to American educators, the second unfavor- 
able peculiarity of American schools is the extraordinary preponderance of female
-P-A-G-E-555
  GERMAN CRITICISM OF AMERICAN EDUCATION. 545 
teachers, necessarily surprising to anyone who, for the first time, receives accurate 
knowledge of the facts in the case. The proportions of the total number do not 
seem so dissimilar. In the year 1890, out of the 363,935 public school teachers, 
125,602, or 34.5 per cent, were men; 238,333, or 65.5 per cent, women. In Prussia, 
excluding the secondary schvols that have male teachers only, the proportion is 
58,464 male to only 13,337 female teachers; or, if we include all special teachers, par- 
ticularly the 39,764 female teachers of handiwork, there are 75,518 male to only 
53,202 female teachers. We might be under the impression that the imperfect con- 
ditions prevailing in the South and West bear the greater burden of the fault. The 
case is contrariwise, for the further the school system has developed, the more female 
teachers there are. In the North Atlantic States only 20 per cent of all teachers are 
male; in the South Central States male teachers form 57 per cent. Massachusetts 
. and Arkansas, with, respectively, 9.9 and 68.5 per cent, are the extremes in these 
groups. Chicago in this respect, too, is about the most American city. In 1892 it 
numbered only 219 male to 3,081 female teachers, only about 6.6 per cent, while the 
whole State of Illinois reached the proportion of 27 per cent male teachers. In the 
public high schools of the United States the proportion is more favorable, the 40 per 
cent of male teachers corresponds exactly to the proportion between the number of 
male and female pupils. The rule seems to be that boys are taught by men and girls 
by women. But 15 and 16 year old boys may be found who are taught by women, 
and not only where coeducation prevails. A photograph of the second class in a 
high school of Maine, the pupils of which were 15 and 16 year old boys, shows them 
practicing calisthenics under the direction of a female teacher. 
The employment of female teachers in public schools is supposed to have started 
in Massachusetts on account of the war of secession. As young men were called to 
military service female teachers were resorted to for substitutes. After the war there 
was such a dearth of men in industrial pursuits that the retention of female teachers 
was a necessity. That may all be very true, but the fundamental cause is a con- 
tinuous one, and lies in existing circumstances. During late years the number of 
male teachers in Massachusetts has decreased by 1,776; in Pennsylvania in one year, 
1888-89, the number of male teachers decreased by 812, and that of the female 
teachers increased 1,048. The near future is illustrated by the fact that the latest 
report on attendance in normal schools shows 93 per cent female pupils for Massa- 
chusetts; 99 per cent for Connecticut, and almost 100 per cent for New Hampshire. 
This state of affairs. is conn d with the frequent changes and instability of 
teachers. In Maine, some time ago, four years was found to be the average time of 
service. The report of 1892 on the high schools of Washington [D. C.] remarks that 
with few exceptions all professionally prepared teachers who had occupied their 
positions four years ago had resigned to enter other more lucrative positions. 
Better opportunities are offered not only to male but to female teachers, who also 
give up their positions to enter upon married life. Of the 28,000 positions connected 
with the Federal Government in Washington, not fewer than 11,000 are held by 
women. Even well-to-do young American women, generally highly educated, well 
informed, and at the same time enterprising, prefer to spend a few years in teaching 
rather than await their future inactively. The official report condenses all this in 
the mournful remark: ‘In the United States the profession of teaching seems to be 
a kind of waiting room in which the young girl awaits a congenial, ulterior support, 
and the young man a more advantageous position.” 
The causes of this are of an intellectual and a material kind. The report of the 
Commissioner of Education remarks somewhere that an educational atmosphere 
prevails in all Germany; so we might say that a business atiaosphere prevails 
throughout America, as far as the men are concerned. Acquisitiveness and a spirit 
of enterprise in a boy are encouraged from the very beginning by education and 
example. As no time 1s left to him for an extended education, the vocation of teacher 
is naturally altogether foreign to his thoughts. On the contrary, girls withheld 
ED 93: 35 
       
-P-A-G-E-556
      546 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
from domestic activity at home acquire more and more taste for the intellectual. 
Women and young girls form the majority of the audience at scientific lectures, 
congresses, etc. Teaching offers the opportunity best adapted to them for public 
activity and, at the same time, the most honorable mode of earning a livelihood. 
Thus, there is a steadily increasing influx of young girls into the profession of 
teaching. That is only a part of the whole movement—the appearance of women 
in publie walks of life, heretofore reserved for men—the more important for us, 
because its influence has already been felt in our own relations of life. In America 
women have monopolized the position of cashiers and typewriters in large offices, 
as they have also done in the telegraph service, and partly in the postal service. 
We have already spoken of the Departments in Washington. Of the 415 colleges 
and universities in the United States, 272 admit young women and men on the same 
conditions. The oldest and most select in the North Atlantic States, however, are 
not among them. There are bésides 179 colleges for women, mostly in the South, 
and really only secondary educational institutions, in which 1,648, or three-fourths, 
of the professors are women. Even in the mixed universities 134 women have 
regular professorships, mostly in music and the other arts; in 24 they are members 
of the boards of trustees. Ata congress in Chicago, self-conscious women orators 
defined the coming century as ‘‘the woman’s century.” " 
This shifting of the lines in the positions of the sexes can not but gradually exert 
a deep influence on all relations of life, and particularly on the whole intellectual 
life. At first sight, we might think that this would, in consequence, receive a more 
feminine character; certain it is, that instruction which appeals exclusively to the 
receptive activity is one of the resultants of this character. But it is the feminine 
character that seems to be influenced; it imbibes the masculine independence and 
industry. Woman, by stepping out of the domestic circle to compete with man, 
seems to increase the unrest, precipitation, and tension in all relations of life. 
Furthermore, the question of salary is included in the much-deplored conditions 
of the profession of teaching. In the official report the salaries of German teachers, 
as they were three years ago, are justly defined as méager according to the American 
standard. It appears to us that American salaries according to the American stand- 
ard are decidedly smaller than German salaries according to the German standard. 
Superintendents, or school councilors as we say, with salaries of $4,000 to $5,000, 
inspectors or supervisors in the principal cities, as well as directors of the larger 
high schools, with $3,000 to $4,000 are well paid. In large cities the principals of 
elementary schools receive from $1,500 to 1,900. Specialists, of whom unusual pro- 
ficiency in their particular branch is required, are paid better than class teachers. 
A drawing teacher in Boston receives $3,000; the instructor of military drill, $2,000. 
Otherwise teachers are poorly paid. Massachusetts, three years ago, paid by far the 
highest salaries; teachers of the elementary schools averaging $954 a year. Connec- 
ticut also paid well, $660 a year. The official report says: ‘Such salaries make the 
permanency of the profession of teachers impossible, a weaver receives just as much.” 
Large cities like Boston, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, ete., pay high salaries. 
But how inadequate are they elsewhere. Pennsylvania, on an average, pays $39 to 
men and $30.03 to women teachers a month. For the year 1889 the official report on 
elementary and high schools together ayerages the salaries, by the month, at $42.43 
for men and $34.27 for women teachers.     
Moreover, in making a comparison, it must be remembered that the advantage of 
permanency connected with positions in Germany does not exist im America. There 
are no pensions and stipends after death (Reliktenversicherung). Salaries are wages 
ealeulated and paid by the month, consisting of four school weeks; vacation months 
are not included. Salaries do not continue during interruption of duties by leave 
of absence or sickness. In Chicago, the amounts deducted are used for paying sub- 
stitutes.

GERMAN CRITICISM OF AMERICAN EDUCATION. 547 
In the annual reports of the school commission the raising of salaries is repeatedly 
declared necessary to win more men over to, and keep them in, the profession of 
teaching. An earnest effort in this respect seems to have been made during the last 
year (1892) by Massachusetts, which raised the average monthly salary of malo 
teachers from $118 to $134, while at the same time it reduced that of female teachers 
from $48 to $46.50; now the law of supply and demand is called into action. The 
more moderate demands of female teachers are a reason for giving them the prefer- 
ence. According to the present prospect, the excessive number of female teachers 
promises to increase still more. 
Conclusion.—In his last report the Commissioner designated the following as sub- 
jects requiring legal regulation: Supervision of private and parochial schools; fur- 
nishing text-books free of charge to all pupils, and of school books by the State. 
As these subjects are warmly discussed in teachers’ assemblies and journals, and can 
be decided upon and settled by legislation, the Commissioner’s selection may be just. 
To our German way of thinking they all appear secondary, with the exception of 
the first mentioned, provided it include a just and peaceable settlement between 
public and parochial schools. To us the most important and pressing duties would 
be to bring about a well-arranged organic connection between high schools and 
universities and, above all, the establishment of a profession of teaching. These 
points can not be settled simply by legislation, but require long labor. 
Intellectual life, religious and scientific interests, are very active along with the 
restlessness of business life in America. The ambition for higher intellectuai cul- 
ture, emanating from individual impulses, is widely diffused and more active than 
with us. A peculiar manifestation of this is “university extension,” which origi- 
nated in England, and has made steady progress in America during the last ten 
years. Its most remarkable fruit is the summer school at Chautauqua, which, with 
its vacation lectures and courses of exercises, its branch societies and reading cir- 
cles, directs the scientific education of 25,000 students, or members. Old univer- 
sities, too, have aided these movements by introducing summer courses. Other 
associations have also been formed for the same purposes. 
Such arrangements still bear the character of immaturity and the amateurs’ want 
of thoroughness, but, at the same time, give evidence of a desire for perfection. 
The superiority of our scientific work and our system of higher education is readily 
acknowledged in America; on the other hand, in much that is practical we follow 
the American precedent, but we do it in our own way; for instance, in our summer 
normal courses and lectures on political economy for mixed eodgaees 
The public school system of the United States is a vigorous institution, which 
during its short existence has grown to its fullest possible extent; but its inner 
development has not kept pace with its exterior. It resembles a young and numer- 
ous army not wanting in warriors and excellent generals, but lacking a requisite 
number of reliable commissioned and noncommissioned officers and well-trained 
drillmasters. 
Ill. Dr. Stephan Waetzoldt, principal of Elizabeth School, professor .of Romanic 
languages and literatures in the University of Berlin, and chief commissioner of the 
German educational exhibit in Chicago, spent nearly eight months in this country, 
and the result of his observations is embodied in three lectures which he delivered 
before the Teachers’ Association in Berlin in February and March, 1894. These off- 
hand lectures, given without manuscript, except when the speaker consulted his

of originality. Perhaps, if the gentleman had reduced his opinions to writing, he 
would have softened an expression here and there, would have moved certain facts 
into a better perspective, and have focused others with the intention of enlisting 
our attention; but as these lectures were intended for German hearers and German 
teachers, we have here the unchanged, original opinion of a man whose opinion is

considered authoritative in Germany. He makes some errors in his facts and dedue- 
tions, but they are so obvious that a comment is scarcely needed for American read- 
ers. His first lecture was chiefly on the German educational exhibit. It is here 
inserted on account of its numerous allusions to the other exhibits and to American 
education. 
THE EDUCATIONAL EXHIBIT IN CHICAGO AND THE SCHOOL SYSTEM 
OF THE UNITED STATES. 
[Three lectures. ] 
By Prof. SrepHAN WAETZOLDT, 
Director of Elizabeth School and professor in the University of Berlin. 
FIRST LECTURE. 
LaDIEs AND GENTLEMEN: In whatever way we may judge the Americans, one 
thing we must concede to them: They devise lofty plans and display unexampled 
energy in their development and execution. When the American mind conceived 
the thought of a World’s Fair in the broadest sense of the term, the plan laid out 
was, not only to undertake a universal exposition of material things, but to draw 
all forms of culture, the intellectual as well, into this emulous contest. The high 
estimation in which education is held in the United States; the deep and broad 
interest manifested in all questions of instruction; the firm conviction that educa- 
tion is the most powerful weapon of the progress of mankind, left no doubt that an. 
educational exhibition in the widest acceptation of the term would be planned. In 
fact, the first outlines sent to us displayed gigantic dimensions. All civilized nations 
of the earth were expected to exert themselves to unite in Chicago whatever they 
possessed in the field of education, from the university down to schools for idiots and 
deaf mutes; and it was thought possible to judge which nation would be victorious 
in the contest. 
The plan was this: Every nation was to show the sites and different types of 
school buildings on as large a chart as possible; explain the administration and 
organization of its school system by inscriptions, tables, and graphic representations, 
and also show the means of instruction peculiar to it. From the very beginning 
particular stress was laid upon exhibiting the work of pupils and students. This 
might then be compared, indeed it was contemplated to institute an international 
comparison which would determine what country had made the greatest progress in 
late years. The execution of this gigantic plan fell behind the idea as first conceived 
and formulated, for at Chicago there were represented, beside all the States of the 
Union, only Germany, England (but only London, and of London only the pauper 
schools), France, Russia, Japan, the South American States, Mexico, and Spain, 
although the educational exhibit of Spain might have found room on this desk. 
Unfortunately Italy, the home of universities, was not represented; nor were Austria, 
Sweden,! Norway, and Denmark, where public education is remarkably progressive. 
At least these latter countries sent very meager exhibits. Without exaggeration 
and self-adulation we can say that the palm of victory belongs to Germany. There 
has not been expressed the slightest doubt as to that. 
The German exhibits were arranged in the upper gallery of the immense Manu- 
factures and Liberal Arts Building, a gallery of such dimensions that the length of 
this spacious hall is not equal by far to its breadth. The space occupied by the 
German school exhibit comprised 2,200 square meters, twice the space of the Phil- 
harmonic Institute. Such was one of the exhibitions. Adjoining were the exhibits 
of England and the United States; opposite to that of Germany was the French 
exhibit. Moreover, a great part of the educational exhibit was placed in other build- 
ings. The tendency to particularism and independence prevented the separate

South American States from joining the general school exhibit, hence their best efforts 
toward. culture could not be seen except in their own respective State buildings.' 
The French exhibit suffered from lack of concentration; it was distributed in three 
buildings: the Manufactures and Liberal Arts Building, the State Pavilion of France, 
and the Palace of Agriculture. The last mentioned contained the exhibit of the 
French schools of agriculture. 
Over the entrance to our German exhibit stood the words ‘‘German educational 
exhibit,” though in reality it was an exhibition of education in Prussia. A patriotic 
and a political reason can be given for this inaccuracy. In foreign countries the names 
of the separate German States sink into oblivion, and the farther away from Germany 
you go, the more does this apply. Germany, the Empire, alone is known. It was 
difficult for Americans to understand that our schools are not under one government, 
that we do not even have general school statistics, and that all our educational 
systems are affairs of the separate States. Foreigners look upon and comprehend 
Germany as a whole. Prussia, as was her duty, took the lead for Germany, and also 
bore all the expenses. It is true that we have an imperial postmaster in Germany, 
but unfortunately no imperial schoolmaster. Wiirtemberg, alone, of the other Ger- 
man States, sent a separate exhibit, not comprehensive, it is true, but excellent on 
the whole and in part, and kept separately within the large exhibit. Bavaria was 
represented in the university exhibit, and partly among the showing of school 
systems by a chart and a few photographs of buildings. Saxony, unfortunately, 
was not represented at all, the Hanseatic cities very meagerly, the Grand Duchy of 
Hesse by a few books. 
The resolution to undertake an educational exhibition on a large scale was framed 
very late with us, but once taken was executed with vigor. The Emperor’s influence 
was secured to obtain an appropriation sufficient for carrying out the purpose well. 
As is the fate of all State appropriations the limit set has been overstepped. We are 
indebted to the minister of education for resolving, despite many a doubt, upon a 
comprehensive educational exhibition. In December, 1892, the work was begun by 
the three judges, Schneider, Stauder, and Althoff. Schmidt, a younger Government 
councilor, undertook the general report. As all was‘to be finished in March, the 
amount of preparatory work required feverish energy. First of all, plans had to be 
d for the great undertaking, material accumulated and sifted, collections 
freight and security considered, etc. The most difficult question, however, 
hat shall we exhibit? That which is best of all, the instruction itself; the 
inspiring word of the teacher, his very life in the class room, transmitted fromeeye to 
eye and mind to mind, we could not reproduce. In their enthusiasm the Americans 
had at first intended to present whole classes in process of being taught, and thus 
institute competitive instruction, but through the just and discriminating prudence 
of the committee of education, and particularly of the president of the advisory 
council for the American educational exhibit, Dr. Wm. T. Harris, this plan was not 
carried out. 
We decided that were we to be represented at all we should have to include all 
departments of education, from the university down to the lowest country school, 
also institutions for the blind, deaf-mutes, and idiots. One department alone was 
excluded, that of technological instruction, and also gymnastics. Let me remark 
here that universities and tie university exhibits lie outside the scope of my address 
to-day. I shall confine myself to schools in the narrower sense of the term. And 
why were the technical schools not represented? The first consideration was that 
America, the land of technics and technical progress, could easily surpass us; more- 
over, there was not money enough for everything; and finally, the department of 
technical education is, with us, unfortunately divided. The management of indus- 
trial and technical schools, as well as technical continuation schools, belongs to the 
department of the interior, not to that of education.

educational side, and not in their State buildings.—Ep.

As was manifested later, the missing exhibit of technical and industrial schools 
was a deplorable deficiency. However, the demands for space, which provoked the 
most heated discussions, were such that we would not have received the space neces- 
sary to represent the technical and industrial schools. How splendid this display 
would have been was shown in an address delivered at the World’s Congress of 
Engineers, August 5, by the American chairman, Mr. Remy, who said that techno- 
logical instruction in all its grades is better in Germany than in America, because it 
is commenced later with more mature students, and is pursued for a longer period of 
time; consequently, it is more profound, more thorough, and much more advanced. 
What a German slowly accomplishes in a year, the American student is expected to 
rush through in four weeks. But, as he said, circumstances in America hardly 
permit it to be otherwise. 
After the resolution had been passed to undertake a German cducational exhibit, 
the work of preparation began. Countless letters and requests had to be addressed 
to publishers. What seemed worth sending had to be arranged according to definite 
points of view, and, above all, statistical material had to be collected ona large 
seale. The most important work inthis line was done by Dr. Petersilie, of the bureau 
of statistics. Furthermore, comprehensive papers on the condition and history of 
public schools, secondary education, and universities, schools for girls, etc., had to 
be prepared in a few months. Thus, in an incredibly short time were produced: 
(1) The great and comprehensive memorial on the Prussian school system (1892), 
embracing all elementary and middle schools, by Messrs. Schneider and Petersilie; 
(2) the excellent history of secondary education in Germany during the nineteenth 
century, with numerous statistical additions by Dr. Rethwisch; (3) the admirable 
work of Miss Helene Lange on the development of institutions for girls; (4) to 
these were added graphic representations of the attendance of high and elementary 
schools, the number of graduates, etc. For wall ornamentation, a large number of 
photographs showing the inner and outer construction of well-known schools, were 
provided, as well as busts of great professors and teachers. The four renowned and 
great friezes, ‘Tho four epochs of science,” by Knille, were taken from among the 
treasures of the National Gallery and formed the finest ornament of the German 
educational exhibit. The first two, the Grecian epoch (philosophers next to a group 
of wrestling youths) and the epoch of Weimar (Goethe and Schiller), were placed 
in the division of school instruction, the two others in the university division. 
Besides these, there were two paintings, ideal representations of secondary and 
elementary schools, designed by a young painter from Berlin, Mr. Koberstein, They 
were pictures of a very large size. 
The place here in Berlin set apart for the collections was quickly filled; in a short 
time there was hardly any room in the halls and the yard. This chaos was cleared 
only by degrees. Almost 800 boxes, whose dimensions averaged 2 cubic meters, 
were sent in installments on two steamers to Baltimore. I shall skip the weeks and 
months during which this chaos changed to order, a period in which from Russia, 
Austria, and America space had to be conquered; the galleries were still building, 
and the architectural decorations were being made. Finally, after a thousand diffi- 
culties had been overcome, the work was.completed. 
Let me invite you to a walk through this educational exhibit. Leaving the Cana- 
dian exhibit we enter from the south side through -a portal of simple Greek propor- 
tions that bears the inscription: ‘‘German educational exhibit.” Before us, along 
the main balustrade, extends the university exhibit; to the left is that of the schools; 
on the upper floor and covering the same space, is a gallery devoted to special 
school and library displays. Looking up into an expanse of immense breadth and 
height filled with a mist of dust which a moving mass of people always raises, we 
see the gigantic framework of the Manufactures Building, with its yellowish-white 
windowpanes, Approaching the banister we look down upon the bustling crowd 
of a city within this building; a city with belfries, turrets, and minarets, in whose

separate quarters all the nations were united. Exhibits of industry and manufac- 
turé were on the ground floor, those of science and the liberal arts in the galleries. 
In our own domain, first an open space was provided for a kind of court of honor, 
so to speak, both for higher and lower education. The first place was occupied by 
the exhibit of education of the blind, a display for which we must thank the Imperial 
Blind Asylum at Steglitz, and which proved to be one of the most attractive points 
of the German exhibit. It was particularly so because of the following three fea- 
tures: (1) The large library in Brailléan script, a library that can not be duplicated, 
for nowhere in the world is there even a similar collection of books. It comprises 
730 volumes, written for the blind in God’s name by matrons and young ladies of the 
society of ‘‘ Edelweiss,” so that the treasures of German literature may be accessible 
to them. Whereas before the blind had only the Bible, some school text-books, and 
a few journals, they now read the best our literature affords: Goethe, Schiller, 
Uhland, Gerok, Scheffel, "'reytag, etc.; (2) the ingeniously devised methods of 
instruction for the blind in natural history, physics, geography, arithmetic, ete. ; 
(8) the models made by the blind themselves after touching tangible objects, thus 
giving us a representation of the world and its objects imagined by the blind. 
Adjoining this (in the court of honor) were the exhibits of the city of Berlin, 
portfolios containing pictures of the most beautiful school buildings, and a row of 
show cases filled with the handiwork of girls from the One hundred and forty- 
third public school. I was asked countless times whether this was the work of 
special schools, and my information that these pieces of work were made in one.of 
the many public schools of Berlin was always received with astonishment. The offi- 
cial graphic representation, which shows that the incomparable growth of the city 
and the gradual increase in schools and educational facilities have gone hand in 
hand, that buildings especially erected for school purposes were always ready when 
the city limits were extended in any direction, awakened the greatest wonder among 
the people at Chicago, This table showed that provision for public schools was 
proportionate to the vast growth of our city from 1861 till 1892. Chicago offers no 
comparison to these statistics—60,000 children there are not going to school for want 
of school facilities and teachers. ‘You have given us a lesson in humility,” said a 
prominent American to me. 
Farther on we come to the library containing the forms of constitution and 
administration of schools; the organizations found in the separate German States 
were here represented, when possible, in every detail. Close by, on a table, was 
placed a collection of German educational journals, arranged by Mr. Arndt, a nor- 
mal school teacher. Hundreds of copies of the special catalogue prepared for this 
collection were given away. None of us who had contributed our share of work to 
this department had known that Germany publishes regularly 239 pedagogical jour- 
nals and 30 teachers’ almanacs, not including journals for juvenile literature; these 
were enumerated in the supplement of Arndt’s catalogue. All the last year’s num- 
bers of these journals had been collected and exhibited in a series of beautifully 
bound volumes. The comparatively few journals of other countries, contrasted 
with the almost appalling number of our country, representing all, even the smallest 
school systems, was a truly proud evidence of the inner work of German educational 
science and method. 
The vestibule which adjoined the court of honor was. crowned by me with the first 
painting of Mr. Koberstein, a large semicircle on the left side of which boys in the 
Frederick-William Gymnasium were represented wrestling and throwing javelins. 
On the right-hand side, separated by an oak that bore the portrait of William von 
Humboldt, a group of boys were gathered around a teacher giving explanations with 
the aid of the microscope. Before this picture were 10 leather-bound folios contain- 
ing the latest and most beautiful plans of school architecture. The volume on the 
history of public school buildings of Prussia from 1821 till 1880 began with the small 
designs of the modest country schoolhouses in 1821 and concluded with the magnifi-

cent public schools now erected by the State and our large cities. The selected 
models of normal schools, preparatory institutions, classical and modern high 
schools, etc., were exact in every detail; for instance, the arrangement of secondary 
schools was shown in models of the Frederick-William Gymnasium and the Augusta 
School. Then the secondary school system was graphically described, and 13 large 
statistical charts showed the progress of education in Prussia during the last twenty 
years in a few striking statements, puzzling even to us who, though in the midst of 
the educational activity, had never beheld such an array of. comparative figures. 
I shall mention only a few of them. They were afterwards divided into two parts, 
taking the dates 1871 and 1892; thus the beginning of the late development of Ger- 
many and Prussia and the present time were placed side by side to facilitate com- 
parison. The normal school students in Prussia numbered 5,000 in 1871 and 10,800 
in 1892. In 1871 the expenditure for normal schools amounted to 1,600,000 marks; 
in 1892 to nearly 5,000,000. The State’s contribution in 1871 was 1,039,000 marks; in 
1892 it was 3,360,000 marks. In the year 1871 Prussia had 1 normal student to every 
4,930 inhabitants; in 1892 the proportion was 1 to 2,764. The proportion of normal 
students to the number of teachers was 1 to 10.4 in 1871; in 1892 it was 1 to 6.6. The 
annual cost of the education of a normal school student was 321 marks in 1871, and 
456 marks in 1892. 
But what we have reason to be most proud of was the chart showing that in the 
matter of obligatory attendance at school we surpass all other nations on the face of 
the earth. Prussia, in the year 1871, numbered 4,464,906 children who were subject 
to the compulsory attendance law; in 1892 the number was 5,401,566. Of these 91.02 
per cent, or nearly 5,000,000, were instructed in the public elementary or people’s 
schools. The 400,000 over and above the 5,000,000, comprising the attendance in 
advanced elementary schools, can hardly be compared numerically with the attend- 
ance in the public schools. In Prussia, 20,783 of the 4,464,906 children in 1871 (and 
the number has always been small) were unjustly withheld from school—that is to 
say, were not enrolled in any school. In the year 1892 only 945 of the 5,401,566 chil- 
dren then subject to the law were unjustly withheld from school.. We should try 
to. understand the meaning of the success of a country in enforcing obligatory 
attendance at school so thoroughly that none but the children of the transitory or 
floating population (sailors, dwellers in canal boats, ropedancers, etc.), can slip 
through the meshes of the legal net. No other country in the world can show simi- 
lar statistics. Not even among the numbers of which France, our closest rival, is 
proud, did I find anything like it. When a commissioner from Russia saw these 
numbers, he said: ‘I do not want to see any more; Iam ashamed,” and went away. 
Permit me to quote a few otheritems. In 1871 we had 52,746 classes, or class rooms 
in the people’s schools, and in 1892 exactly 30,000 more, 82,746. The number of 
pupils, as mentioned before, had increased by 1,000,000 during the same twenty-one 
years. The number of teachers during this period increased by about 19,000, or 
about 1,000 every year. 
Letus now consider the question of expenditure. We read in American newspapers 
that Germany has no money for its schools, and that it is being slowly eaten up by 
expenditures for its armed defense. The following numbers prove that there has 
been money for the schools, though not always sufficient. The expenses of public 
schools in 1871, in Prussia alone, amounted to 55,648,000 marks; twenty years later 
they amounted to 146,225,000 marks. In 1871 the State defrayed 2,895,000 marks of 
the sum total for elementary instruction; in 1891, 46,495,000 marks. In 1871 the 
tuition fees amounted to 10,490,000 marks: in 1891, only 1,398,000 marks. These 
figures show that our elementary schools are fast becoming gratuitous schools. 
In 1871, a people’s or elementary school cost 1,976 marks; in 1891 it cost 4,029 marks. 
In 1871 every 1,000 inhabitants paid 2,262 marks school expenses; in 1891 they paid 
4,881 marks, which is 4.80 marks annually to every inhabitant.

  GERMAN CRITICISM OF AMERICAN EDUCATION. 553 
In conelusion I mention the charts, which showed the education of our army 
recruits. In Prussia in 1867-68 as many as 3.72 per cent of the recruits were with- 
out school education; in 1891-92 only 0.69 per cent. Even Posen, the poorest prov- 
ince in this respect, reduced its 14.78 per cent of 1867-68 to 2.38 per cent. These are 
figures of which we may justly be proud. We find similar elating facts with regard 
to secondary education. Allow me to touch upon a few only. The entire expendi 
tures of Prussia for high schools (classical and modern) in 1871 amounted to 
7,534,000 marks; in 1891, to 30,918,000. In 1871 the salaries of the teachers of these 
schools amounted to 5,500,000; in 1892, to 25,733,000 marks. 
Not so favorable a light was thrown on the development of our schools by other 
numbers, particularly those that showed what positions in life are held by the pupils 
of secondary educational institutions. Really surprising, at first sight, was the dis- 
proportion in the attendance of the upper and lower grades of the various kinds of 
secondary educational institutions. Exactly 18 per cent of all the pupils attended 
the upper grades of the ‘‘Gymnasia;” 37 per cent and a fraction the middle grades, 
and 44 per cent and a fraction the lower grades. That is approximately the normal 
status. In the ‘ Realgymnasia” only 7.62 per cent of all the pupils reached the 
upper grades (i. e., ‘‘ Prima” and ‘‘Secunda”); 39 per cent the middle, and 53 per 
cent and a fraction attended the lower grades. In “ Realschulen,” of the first and 
second order, the proportions were 1.18 (or 235 pupils), 33 per cent anda fraction (or 
6,615), and 65 per cent (or 13,043). I know very well that in interpreting these 
numbers we must consider the peculiar German institution—the right of a one- 
year military service, which is acquired by attending only seven of the nine years’ 
course of secondary education. This is the chief motive of many in attending 
secondary schools who would otherwise not enter them. 
Another question is, what vocations do the graduates of the ‘‘Gymnasia” (of 9 
grades), ‘‘ Realgymnasia,” and ‘‘Realschulen” choose? Of those who received diplo- 
mas between the years 1868 and 1891, only 71,226 had completed the course of gym- 
nasia, but 120,000 that of “‘Realschulen.” Of the first-mentioned number, 52,000; or 
74 per cent, devoted themselves to the higher professions and entered the universities, 
5 per cent to technological, and 20 per cent to other pursuits (those of merchants, 
civil service, etc.), fractions of a per cent not being considered. It is astonishing to 
notice that of the graduates of ‘‘Realgymnasia” 30 per cent aim at the higher pro- 
fessions, 20 per cent at technological, and 50 per cent at other pursuits. From this 
it becomes obvious that the institutions for technological education labor under the 
difficulty of being obliged to admit students without a thorough secondary educa- 
tion. In comparison with other States our showing is not very good, and proves the 
necessity of reform. 
Leaving these tables of statistics and turning toward the large aisle of the German 
educational exhibit, we find a large number of models of buildings, rooms, baths 
(from Géttingen), and separate halls, and an immense number of apparatus and 
devices for teaching. Here we could see how rich‘and inventive Germany is in 
physical, chemical, geographical, botanical, and zoological representations, and why 
it supplies the whole world. The space on the left side of this aisle was taken up by 
girls’ schools, elementary schools, and institutions for deaf-mutes and idiots. On the 
upper gallery, to the left, were the exhibit of normal and their preparatory schools 
and manual training schools. On the right of the aisle referred to the exhibit of the 
secondary schools was divided according to disciplinary studies: mathematics, 
physics, descriptive natural history, modern and ancient languages, ete. In every 
one of the single groups and divisions a definite idea had been carried ont. 
The historical development of this kind of schools was shown in old publications, 
programmes, courses of study, comparative statistics, and pictorial representations; 
then attention was drawn to their present status by means of the same objects in 
their latest forms. The study of history, for example, was illustrated by a series of 
libraries with special catalogues, collected and arranged for this purpose. The text-    
       
-P-A-G-E-564
      554 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
books and books of reference of the Prussian normal schools alone numbered 270 
volumes; the library of the normal school at Oranienburg, 580; the library for the 
pupils of a high school for girls, 420; a scholars’ library, 30; a city school library in 
Berlin, 256; the library of hygiene and physical culture, 123, and the one exclusively 
made up of books on methods of teaching, over 300 volumes. Professor Fechner 
had collected 225 school readers, including nearly all the editions from 1771 to 1893, 
The catalogue of this unique collection contained in itself the history of the German 
public school reader. 
The apparatus for natural philosophy of a Berlin city school filled 5 show cases, 
each measuring a cubic meter. When we told Americans or other foreigners that 
each of the city schools (200 of them) of Berlin had that many pieces of apparatus 
for instruction in natural science, and that these schools are not high schools, gym- 
nasia, or schools of technology, but simple elementary schools, they were very much 
astonished. Perhaps we do too much in furnishing apparatus. The Americans lay - 
great stress upon having only a few simple pieces of apparatus which, if possible, 
the teacher and pupils construct themselves. Iam convinced that it is to the pupil’s 
advantage to learn the principles by means of his own handiwork. The attempt was 
also made to show the development of instruction in geography by means of the 
oldest, later, and latest school books and appliances; thus, for instance, a gymnasium 
in Danzig exhibited the map of Prussia which it used in 1700, side by side with the 
one it makes use of to-day. The gymnasium in Gérlitz sent the terrestrial globe 
used in 1680, and one procured in 1880. Atlases used in our schools during the seven- 
teenth century, the microscope used in the eighteenth, and like instruments used in 
our century, were among the exhibits. 
On the walls and partitions, a mural surface of about 500 square meters, there 
were placed abundant illustrations of school buildings, selected charts, and maps, 
the best specimens of object-lesson charts, the fresco and other ornamentation of 
our school assembly halls, all in separate specimens. Whoever examined this abun- 
dance knows that most of what was sent remained partially hidden in closets, map 
cases and portfolios. 
Finally, we come to the selected work of pupils and graduates that was criticised 
and ridiculed so much on our side of the ocean. In Germany, the fact of our send- 
ing whole stacks of chests filled with copy and exercise books elicited many satirical 
comments, The Zukunft even published a humorous article on the subject, but 
experience proved that no other exhibit was so closely studied and investigated as 
the written work of our pupils. The reason for this is easily understood. The work 
of the pupils and graduates of normal schools, gymnasia, ‘ Realschulen,” cte., 
probably 18,000 books, seemed lost in the immense extent of the exhibit. In judg- 
ing a school, the most important factor is always the achievements of its pupils; 
and there was no other way for us to show the ability of the pupils except by written 
work. The exercise books were put into plain, dark cardboard cases and distributed 
among the tables over the entire space allotted to us. It was a matter of principle 
with us to exhibit no exemplary work at Chicago, made for the occasion, but simply 
the everyday work of schools during 1892, or at the beginning of 1893; that is, note- 
books as they came from the pupils’ hands during class work. The worst specimens, 
of course, were not selected, but from a number of typical institutions about 20 
books of every kind were chosen in such a way that from each class of these institu- 
tions a number of good, medium, and poor exercise books were exhibited, thus giy- 
ing an accurate idea of what is accomplished in these schools. 
It took the awarding judges a long time to understand that we had exhibited no 
prize work, and that we had included bad work to show the true state of things. 
They looked upon the bad as prize work and wondered at the many mistakes. All 
other nations! had exhibited prize work. American journals, educational and others

interested in the German exhibit, declared upon the evidence of these exercises, 
that they had had no suspicion of what a German teacher accomplishes in the way 
of interlinear correction. To correct the compositions of forty to fifty pupils in a 
“German school gives the teacher many hours of work outside of the class work. The 
red ink marks and notes in the thousands of copybooks were a monument of honor 
to German pedagogues, and honor and recognition were generously bestowed upon. 
them. ‘ 
How else could a foreigner have seen the actual work of our pupils? Even should 
he visit our schools with recommendations and letters of introduction from the min- 
ister of education, what rector would allow him to inspect the exercise books of all 
the classes? Such a thing would hardly happen. Hence foreign teachers and pro-. 
fessors truly said that they could buy our printed. text-books and manufactured 
devices for instruction any day by ordering them through the ordinary channels of 
trade; that they could copy our catalogues, syllabi, and programmes, but that this 
was their only opportunity of seeing the real work of ourschools. Russians, Swedes, 
Norwegians, and Americans labored for weeks and months at. this exhibit. The 
work of graduates was of special importance. What had been accomplished before 
leaving the normal school showed absolutely what we require of our public school- 
teacher before he enters upon the practice of teaching. And then compare with it 
the accomplishments of the average American teacher who has passed an examina- , 
tion for primary education. From the work of graduates of secondary schools the 
visitors saw what we demand in the nature of intellectual work from our young men 
before they enter universities. The whole of the first two years’ work in an Ameri- 
can university is included in the last two years of the gymnasiuminGermany. With 
few exceptions, the graduates’ work of American colleges alone can be placed on a 
level with that of our gymnasial graduates, That was the opinion expressed by all 
who understood the difference existing, and they were not all Americans. { 
Now, what has been the fate of these scholars’ efforts? There was much talk, 
about it in Germany, and it was finally decided that this work of pupils would be 
thrown into Lake Michigan or be used as wrapping or packing paper, Most of the 
other exhibits came back from America; those were not wanted. But while we 
supposed that the pupils’ work would not be wanted by the Americans, it is a fact 
that students of education and several universities contended for them and paid 
eash for them. Most of the exercise books are to be preserved in the large museum 
of education in Philadelphia. This city subscribed $300,000, or 1,200,000 marks, for 
the erection of a museum of education exclusively. The German exhibits that haye 
gone to Philadelphia form the foundation of a foreign section there; so then the 
mistakes of our girls and boys in quarta (fourth grade in a gymnasium) will be pre- 
served in Philadelphia as a perpetual remembrance, Another portion of the pupils’ 
work will be kept in the library of the University of New York; another in Michi- 
gan, and the rest in California. The Americans realized that they would not be 
able again to obtain such material for examination and comparison. In collecting 
as much of pupils’ work as possible from all the exhibits from the French, Japanese, 
etc., they accumulated highly interesting material for comparison. 
It is also important to know that in America the chair of pedagogics in universi- 
ties is filled by pedagogues and not by philosphers; that the professor teaches, and 
also practices pedagogy. In so far as pupils’ actual work compares, not only in. 
theories but in facts, there are perhaps no better subjects for comparative study 
than the exercise books of American, English, Swedish, and German pupils. 
What opinion was pronounced on the German educational exhibit? As far as 
I know, all that we accomplished was appreciated, and at times overestimated. 
Knowing the weak points of our own educational systems and the distance we must 
measure before attaining conditions with which we can be satisfied, we were some- 
times rather embarrassed by the praise lavished upon our achievements, 
   
-P-A-G-E-566
  Ea EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Every one of the great civilized countries sent a delegation of educators to Chicago. 
France sent six delegates, among them the brother of the renowned director of French 
primary schools, M. Buisson; the rector of Poitiers, M. Compayré, and also a woman. 
Russia delegated Prince Wolkonski; the University of St. Petersburg sent Professor 
Dimscha and Mme. von Schemstkin; Denmark sent a lady from Copenhagen, who gave 
us enough to do. She was the awarding judge for German normal schools and their 
preparatory institutions, and I must confess that she had very profound knowledge 
of professional preparation for teachers. I carried on many a heated discussion with 
her to convince her, not always convinced myself, of the excellence of our organiza. 
tions. Sweden and Norway had sent quite a number of noted educators, among 
them the director of the pedagogical seminary in Stockholm. Representatives from 
the United States were numerous. Besides official delegates, there were hundreds 
of teachers who individually visited the exhibition. 
Their first question invariably was: ‘‘ Where is your kindergarten?” The German 
educational exhibit included no kindergartens by reason of their forming no part of 
the governmentalsystem. Kindergarten education wasrepresented elsewhere; partly 
in the Children’s Building. Thesecond question was: ‘‘ Where is your public (mean- 
ing people’s) school work?” We had exhibited no written work of the elementary 
schools of Prussia, but had selected and arranged a large collection from Wiirtem- 
berg. This collection showed that the people’s schools in that country have attained 
a high degree of efficiency. Another question was: ‘“What method do you adopt?” 
or, ‘‘What is your system?” We often met with the opinion that a single system 
predominates in Germany; that a book, so to speak, a prescriptive regulation (like 
the English education code) applies to the whole Empire. If one inquired concerning 
our method and was directed to the library containing the methods of teaching in 
elementary schools in a long row of volumes, or perhaps only the methods adapted 
for teaching a single branch, say, arithmetic, he turned away in dismay. The ques- 
tion: “How do you teach reading, music or physics or singing, ete.?” was asked 
every minute. One day a young lady representing a large newspaper came to me, 
sat down, and, taking out her notebook, said with American determination: ‘‘Now, 
my dear Professor, what are your views on education?” She expected my pedagogical 
creed in a nutshell. 
Thus we were brought face to face with the peculiarity of American education 
and how it is understood in that country. Only the best schools of the most 
progressive States have an idea of the manifold liberty that permeates all our uni- 
formity and directive agencies, the liberty of the individual teacher in momentary 
formation and treatment of their subjects. We had on exhibition a collection of 
all the text-books used by the pupils of 40 schools, including rural schools of the 
western, middle, and eastern sections of Germany, and those of large, medium-sized, 
and small cities. When a d to show the books of our elementary schools, every- 
one was astonished when we pointed to the Bible, a book of biblical history, an 
arithme a copy book for penmanship, and a reader used in a city school of Berlin. 
_ At first it was hard for Americans to understand that with us the teacher himself 
replaces the text-book on physics, zoology, botany, etc. 
Americans and Germans do not agree on this point. Our tendency is to instruct 
orally as much as possible, and to make use of a book only when it is necessary for 
reference. The Americans teach by means of a text-book, not because of the ina- 
bility of the teacher, but from pedagogical principles. Their idea is that in acquir- 
ing knowledge the pupil should not feel continually dependent upon the teacher, 
but should himself do as much work as possible. Their books are very cleverly 
divided into a number of lessons. Questions relative to the subject of the lesson 
are given to the pupils in brief form to awaken thought. The teacher assigns a 
lesson that has not been reviewed, and the pupil, like the gold digger, studies by 
“digging out the lesson.” American teachers are of the opinion that our method 
keeps the pupil constantly dependent and gives him too little chance for self-activ- 
      
   
-P-A-G-E-567
  GERMAN CRITICISM OF AMERICAN EDUCATION, 557 
ity. Their purpose is to let him do as much work as he can by himself. The teacher 
must only supplement, help, steer, or direct, and in so doing interfere as little as 
possible with the independence of his pupil. That is, in rough outline, the Ameri- 
can principle, according to which there is, in most cases, nothing of what we call 
vivid oral instruction and the unfolding of the subject-matter in class. An Ameri- 
can teacher rarely enjoys that supreme pleasure of reading in the eyes of his class 
that they are following him, nor has he the pleasurable consciousness of developing 
a subject himself as the exigencies of the moment demand. 
This is a consequence of the low average of the professional education of American 
teachers, which to me, on the whole, seemed particularly low. Perhaps our method 
is at fault in a measure. It seems to me that we clear away too many difficulties for 
the pupil; we make study too easy for him, are too anxious to spare him work by 
which he himself could discover what we elucidate. Undoubtedly the American 
pupil is more independent of his teacher than the German. That independence is 
a consequence of the general attitude of the pupil toward the teacher, which is 
influenced by the general position of youth in the nation. 
The Americans believe, and I think they are right, that their drawing and model- 
ing aresuperior to ours. In good American schools instruction in both is given from 
the very first. Practice of the hand and eye is cultivated from the first day of 
school. It seems to me that American drawing is lighter, freer, and easier than ours. © 
A second superiority in American schools which I noticed is the pupils’ command of 
their mother tongue, written as well as spoken. It surprised every one of us to 
observe with what confidence and facility the pupils wrote their mother tongue. 
For instance, we entered a class of the second school year; the teacher said: ‘Here 
isa gentleman from Berlin. Berlin is in Germany. He wishes to see our school. 
Now, write what you see.” The children took a sheet of paper and wrote the fol- 
lowing: ‘‘A gentleman comes into our school. This gentleman is from Berlin. He 
looks kind. He speaks with the teacher. He can speak English.” The children 
expressed themselves in short, forcible sentences. 
An off-hand composition on the fish by a class of the second year also was as fol- 
lows: “I have seen a fish. I saw the gills of the fish too; they are red. , Our teacher 
says fish breathe through the gills. My father always eats baked fish.” That is 
how Americans teach; they allow children to write on quietly, and correct only the 
worst mistakes. American pupils do not use exercise books, but simply plain sheets 
of paper. They write only very short compositions on what they know, see, or have 
personally experienced. On the other hand, we insist entirely too much upon imi- 
tation of literary examples, make our pupils write too much according to models, 
and we criticise their language too closely. The liberty which allows a child its 
naiveté of expression, the artlessness of its views, and the simplicity of its language, 
we do not always find with us. In regard to that we can learn something from the 
Americans. 
Not to try your patience too long I shall mention but one other fact. Our com- 
pulsory attendance at school, the length of sessions, the large number of school days 
in a year, the large average attendance, the universality of popular education, the 
extent and thoroughness of our normal school course, the excellence and abundance 
of our devices for object teaching and the accurate and tasteful execution of our 
apparatus, awakened the greatest admiration. Americans acknowledged our supe- 
riority over them in these matters. The liberty that does not allow the individual 
teacher’s own work to suffer under restrictive regulations is entirely unknown to 
them. The German system of instruction was much commented upon by Americans 
of high standing and others. A Frenchman, a member of the Institute, said that our 
educational exhibit was the best manifestation of Germany’s power, and we often 
heard that the seriousness of the German character was clearly revealed in this 
division of the great Exposition. A Chicago student spenta long time in this depart- 
ment to prepare for his doctorate a dissertation on the leading thoughts in the 
German educational exhibit.  
-P-A-G-E-568
  
  558 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Now, what is going to become of all this material? The text and exercise books 
left in America we can easily replace, but shall what remains be scattered to the 
winds? Tt will be a difficult task to form so complete a collection again, for seldom 
is so ardent a zeal aroused as that which everyone displayed who contributed in 
any way to this work. Could we not succeed in keeping it together if only as a 
provisionary foundation for a German museum of education to be established on a 
more elaborate scale to serve educational purposes? All our large libraries might 
contribute their superfluous schoolbooks. 
If we could collect the literature of every branch of study in systematic retro- 
gradation until we had compiled a history of these branches, we would know exactly 
the development of a subject from the most illiterate to the present time. Just now 
no one knows anything of the history of such subjects. If we could retrace our steps 
in the past by means of school programmes, organizatory orders, and other school 
publications, we would attain an excellent object: The history of German schools 
from sources at present unknown. What we now call history of education is not a 
history of facts, but of systems and theories. If we were to investigate how much 
of the theories of Salzmann and Pestalozzi and others had entered the schools as late 
as 1830, we would find that outside of books their views influenced the people and the 
methods of teaching much less than we care to acknowledge. 
Were we to collect all educational appliances upon this stock collection, it might 
become a place of reference for the information of school authorities, directors, and 
teachers as well as for specialists. It might likewise be a receptacle for the school 
statistics of Germany and for the history of the schools in all the German-speaking 
nations at present not in existence. We should then have an educational watch 
tower from which to observe whatschools of other nations accomplish. I believe wo 
do not look beyond our own confines often enough to have other than biased views of 
the great success our school system has met with. It would be well for usif we 
had the place and the number of men there are in the United States whose life’s work 
is to introduce into the schools of their country whatever they find good and excel- 
lent on the other side of the ocean in the methods of the great, civilized nations of 
the Old World. Such an institution could effect much general good; whether it will 
ever exist is still doubtful. 
Permit me to draw your attention once more to the characteristic features of the 
American educational exhibit. What is most important for us to notice is that 
the exhibit was not arranged according to auniform plan; the work of whole schools 
and that of individuals were placed next to each other heterogenously. The whole 
exhibit seemed to lack system. Strictly systematic arrangement was a feature of 
our exhibit made possible only, because affairs having been conducted by compara- 
tively few persons perfectly familiar with the leading thoughts, everything was 
directed from a common center. In the American exhibit excellence was found side 
by side with puerile endeavors; some instances, indeed, are almost incredible. 
Amoug pupils’ work, asmall number of the Catholic schools of one State had exhib- 
ited a portraitof Pope Leo made of their bishops’ hair. That wasalso pupils’ work, 
but there was much that was excellent in this very odd collection. 
It was interesting to sec how young States like the Dakotas, having been States 
only afew years, became studded with universities, seminaries, public scheols, and 
high schools. In South Dakota, which was a Territory four years ago, the univer- 
sity had already burned down once. Iowa, Nebraska, and a number of other young 
States presented classes by means of photographs and the phonograph. As large a 
photograph as possible was taken of a class during the hour of recitation, and the 
recitation itself was taken down word for word in shorthand, and these notes tran- 
scribed on a typewriter and bound; sometimes a whole lesson was spoken into the 
phonograph. So, then, seated in an easy chair, with the ends of the tubes of the Edi- 
son phonograph held to our ears and the large photograph of the class before us, 
we heard the teachers instruct and the pupilsanswer. Thus we were enabled to pass   
 
-P-A-G-E-569

judgment on a model lesson in history or grammar, and could convince ourselves of 
its correctness by the engrossed stenogram submitted. Among my collections, still 
on the ocean, I have a number of such phonograms and photographs which were 
presented tome. Perhaps I shall be able to give you the opportunity of listening 
to such a history lesson recited in South Dakota. 
In all American schools and exhibits, as said before, much stress was laid upon 
what Americans call individual work, i. e., not only the achievements of a class, but 
also that which a single pupil accomplishes by choice under direction of his teacher. 
Their principle of not depriving the pupil of his independence influences also their 
estimation of personal accomplishments peculiar to them, i.e., drawing and modeling. 
Very odd things were produced in this individual work. A girlin a Utah school had 
prepared a folio volume containing the entire history of literature of all civilized 
countries arranged in parallel columns; this was considered a particularly great 
piece of work, Further on we saw large volumes of written lectures on psychology 
and pedagogy. To us this overestimation of paper work, the printed or written as 
against what we call the living word, seems very strange. 
THE SCHOOL SYSTEM OF THE UNITED STATES. 
By Prof. SrepHan Wartzoxpt?, of Berlin. 
SECOND LECTURE, 
Lapirs AND GENTLEMEN: In my first lecture I had the pleasure of showing you 
how the German educational exhibit developed, what impression it made on the 
different nations, particularly on American teachers, and how, judging our achieve- 
ments from the American standpoint, it brought to light certain fundamental differ- 
ences between our pedagogic conceptions and those of the Americans. To-day per- 
mit me to acquaint you with the government and policy of public education in the 
United States, In order to understand under what conditions schools, or the educa- 
tional life of a nation may thrive, we must glance at its historical, economic, and 
social position, and at the conditions of its political existence; for the educational 
institutions of a nation are strongly influenced by its history, its activity, and their 
effects. We must consider what the talent of the nation is, the bent of the educa- 
tion it requires to fulfill the duties of citizenship, and the end it purposes to attain 
through its education. 
Being descendants of the most gifted nations of Europe, Americans, on an-average, 
are presumably not less gifted than their ancestors of the Old World. The country 
has developed from colonies; only the adventurous emigrate, those-who have ideas 
of their own and the strong will to carry their ideas into effect; in short, active, 
aspiring people, while the sluggish and inert stay at home. Hence this involuntary 
selection explains the very natural increase in talent and capacity. Experience 
teaches that a great increase in national ability takes place in consequence of an 
intermingling of representatives of highly civilized nations. On the whole, the 
union of Germanic-Anglo-Saxon and Romano-Celtic blood has not been attended by 
unfavorable results. The conditions of life and nature are similar to those of Euro- 
pean nations. The energy of North Americans has had a broad and fertile field for 
display from the beginning; their intelligence has been stimulated by struggles 
with nature and circumstances, so that the physical and mental constitution of the 
American, though similar to that of Europeans, has become more refined and much 
more active. 
Americans consider themselves more intelligent than all other nations. An Ameri- 
ean never thinks slightingly of himself; he believes himself to be the man of the 
future, conscious that nothing within the limits of human power and ingenuity is 
impossible for him. His achievements prove that he thinks and acts very quickly, 
that he is gifted with a lively imagination, and that, perhaps, in his youth his

560 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  moral emotions exercise little restrictive power; though this is rather a doubtful 
assertion. If ave contemplate the immigrant in the United States in the second or 
third generation, we find that he comprehends quickly, learns eagerly, is not nar- 
rowed down in the exercise of his will power, and is altogether practical. Ameri- 
can schools aim directly at being practical from the lowest primary school to the 
final university course. 
The Americans are superior to all other nations in the precocity of the young, 
which shows itself in physical development, as well as in that of character. While 
the twenty-fifth year is accepted as the beginning of the productive age in our 
States, it is from five to eight years earlier among the middle classes in America. 
This more rapid development is partly due to the fact that Americans enter into 
business life earlier; their boys become independent very soon. This is a pecuniary 
gain for the nation, since parents are rid of their children earlier, and a propor- 
tionally larger number of persons are simultaneously self-supporting. Inasmuch as 
everyone yields to youth in America, the American boy is or is considered, the rep- 
resentative of the future; he is everywhere looked upon as the bearer of new ideas; 
whoever does not care to grow old associates with youth and the youngest. - Even 
in the family the child is independent at an early age. Parental authority and 
strict home training are seldom met with. Girls and boys are educated alike in and 
out of school. In order to understand the peculiarity of life at school, we must 
consider that the two sexes associate unreservedly with each other. 
It is a principle with Americans to allow a free development as early as possihle. 
Erudition, if not turned to practical account, is not much thought of. The aim of 
public schools (the question of higher education lies outside the pale of my dis- 
course) above all things, is to educate practical men, competent to fill the great 
vacant spaces still existing, increase opulence, and work together in the business 
interests that engage the minds of all intellectual men. Thus are developed an 
expansive race, characters quickly resolute, energetic and unwavering in execution. 
Considerable difference, however, exists between the old States of the Atlantic 
Coast, the Central, and the Western States. The first already lead a historic exist- 
ence, in pursuance of which relations, things, and people are similar to those of 
Europe. The Central and the Western States are still young. 
It soon becomes evident that this nation and its children, when compared with 
ours, are lacking in pensiveness, warmth of feeling, tenderness, and childlike sim- 
plicity, and do not enjoy what may be called the fairy life of imagination and 
heart. Americans unreluctantly acknowledge that they look at things from a 
pird’s-eye view, or at an eagle’s perspective. Of great weight in considering their 
schools and their ready acceptance of what is new and foreign, is the fact that their 
country is poor in history and monuments; they are not hampered by the strong 
traditions from the eternal past handed down to old civilized nations like ours. 
Americans readily comprehend what is new, and incline to making experiments. 
They are impatient for quick results, even in education. They expect to pick the 
ripe fruit of pedagogic sciences and skill in an incredibly short period of time. The 
schemes and policy followed in their schools sometimes foster these forced conditions. 
Moreover, Americans are easily deceived by first results quickly gained. 
America possesses proportionally few highly educated persons. Comparatively 
few men have more than regular common school education, or have taken the full 
course of elementary and high schools and attended universities to enter upon life 
as highly educated men. The eduéational course of Americans runs in zigzag lines, 
and is interrupted by other occupations. The adult eventually acknowledges the 
necessity of education, recognizing insufficiencies not felt at first; therefore we often 
find wide gaps in the most cultivated American minds, The Americans have been 
defined as the type of a nation in which gross ignorance never prevails among the 
masses. There are as few persons wholly uneducated as there are those of high and 
refined education, so that in general in regard to knowledge and intellectual inter-
-P-A-G-E-571
  
GERMAN CRITICISM OF AMERICAN EDUCATION. 561 
ests an equilibrium exists. Americans have an instinctive regard for education, and 
long for its possession; but not being desirous of gaining knowledge only at school, 
schcols are considered a thing to be dispensed with as early as possible. The popu- 
larization of science in America, however, makes learning out of school easy. 
There is no other country in the world in which so many tearned, popular lectures 
are delivered. Summer schools are identified with summer resorts only for the pur- 
pose of attracting professors to deliver scientific discourses in the quiet of rural 
surroundings. America has numerous well-edited journals. The English language 
during the last century has developed into an excellent medium of communication 
for common intercourse as well as for scientific purposes. In striving to admit as 
muny as possible into the higher institutions of learning, Americans, good politicians 
as they are, make access to higher courses as easy as possible. 
When we consider what each State does and the whole Union does for advanced 
schools we must conclude that entirely too much importance is attached to them, 
combined with a certain vanity of higher education. Every American school, of 
whatever kind, from the university down to the primary school, is, on principle, an 
affair of the community. The management of common schools is neither an affair 
of the Federal nor of the State government, but of that of the community. Accord- 
ingly, every city, even the smallest, has full liberty to arrange its school system as 
it will and can. It alone, within the limits of the State school law, has the right 
of examination, appointment, and supervision of teachers; of prescribing the course 
of study; determining the methods, aims, and discipline in the minutest detail; 
planning and overseeing the construction of its schoolhouses; selecting the text- 
books, and exercising supervision. In consequence, acommendable rivalry is engen- 
dered between cities regarding the advancement of their schools; but, on the other 
hand, a spirit of local patriotism permeates all educational affairs. It is actually 
difficult to learn from the inhabitants of the city itself what is going on in its 
schools; and if we examine them ourselves, things sometimes loak very different 
from what we have been led to suppose. 
The State requires that the community do everything; so you can readily imagine 
that the schools of thinly populated districts differ greatly in their results. Poor 
localities have schools miserably equipped, if they have any at all; while old, 
wealthy, and large communities have a large number of excellent schools. * * * 
The total public school expenditure amounted to $140,000,000 in 1890. Every pupil 
annually costs 72 marks; in Prussia 29.74 marks. The difference, however, is decep- 
tive, for the purchasing power of $1 in the United States is often not greater than 
that of a mark in Germany; so the average cost of a pupil is about the same in 
both countries. In considering expenses, salaries, etc., we must not forget that 
more can be done with 4.20 marks in Germany than with $1 in America. Publie 
schools in the United States offer gratuitous instruction; there is in many places 
no charge for text-books, stationery, or reference books used by the pupils. It is 
customary to have a library in connection with every school, and each pupil under 
direction is daily allowed to spend from a half hour to an hour in referring to the 
dictionaries and lexicons for such information as he may need or desire. 
Let us see how matters stand in regard to compulsory attendance at school. 
Legally enforced attendance, as it exists with us, we find only in the New England 
States, and New York, New Jersey, Texas, Nevada, and California. In Texas and 
Nevada, however, the conditions of education and the distribution of the popula~ 
tion do not permit compulsory attendance. Texas, with an area larger than that of 
Germany, and numbering only 2,500,000 inhabitants, has vast unsettled districts 
toward its western boundary. In California the conditions of civilization and set- 
tlement make compulsory attendance at school altogether illusory. But what is 
worse than all is that in none of these States having a compulsory attendance law 
ean a father be forced to send his children to school. Such action contradicts the 
American conception of personal liberty. There are no policemen for that purpose, 
ED 93——36  
-P-A-G-E-572
  562 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
no gendarmes (constables on horseback) to force children to go to school. Nojudge 
can sentence a father to punishment for wrongfully keeping a child from school. To 
be sure, he ought to send his child to school, but it is often the case that he does 
not do it. 
America shows universal weakness in the lack of executive power and vigilance, 
resulting from the fear of encroaching upon the liberty of its citizens. There is 
nowhere strict execution of legal orders regarding attendance at school. But we 
must not forget that in the United Statesno measure exists by which an accurate 
list of the number of children who ought to go to school can be made out. Families 
are not required to announce their arrival and have their names and address, or 
change of address, entered upon the civil roll.at the city hall. Authorities have no 
means of finding out when children attain the proper age for being admitted into 
school. We allow ourselves to be hoodwinked when we believe what we read, that 
ina certain State children are obliged by law to attend school for eight years. A 
few cities to which the cause of education is dear have instituted a school police 
force. In Boston these “truant officers,” as they are called, number about 16 men, 
who, voluntarily, investigate the cause of neglect in attendance, and attempt to 
prevent the employment of children too young to leave the school; but it is impos- 
sible for them to fulfill their duty to the full extent. The word ‘‘truant” means 
idler (Tagedieb); accordingly ‘‘ truant officers” would mean police after loafers 
(Bummlerpolizei). It is almost ludicrous to say that compulsory education is gen- 
erally adopted in the United States. To understand that neglected children are not 
disposed to go to school, we must visit the labor quarters of cities like New York, 
Chicago, etc., and see the children come out of the factories, * * * 
According to authentic reports from New York, not more than 72 per cent of all 
children who should go to school can be induced to do so; 28 per cent, the street 
Arabs, never attend school. The greater number of these 72 per cent.attend only dur- 
ing threo to four months of the year, and only about 30 per cent go for four consecutive 
years. Statistics referring to these conditions, however, are always very imperfect. 
Wenaturally ask, ‘‘What reason have children for staying away from school?” I 
have at hand the last school report from Chicago. The school year extends from one 
summer vacation to the other, from September till June, and the committee of inves- 
tigation found that during the year 1891-92, 12,900 children missed school from insuffi- 
cient causes; 9,275 were notorious loafers and idlers who could not be foreed into 
school. Among these youths crime finds its recruits. The other3,130 cases are thus 
accounted for: 504 children did not go to school because they worked away from 
home; 362 were obliged to work at home; 571 were kept at home by parents disap- 
proving of education; 25 because of physical deformities; 390 victims of poverty 
stayed at home for want-of clothing. In all Chicago 32 only had private lessons at 
home; 879 were always sick; 395 were absent for unknown reasons; 65 were beyond 
the required age, though still deficient in knowledge. 
As many as 1,336 children never attended school on account of the indifference of 
their parents, the depravity of the father, or the incorrigibility of the children them- 
selves. The reasons given for the latter were intemperance of parents, the father 
being away from home, or entire abandonment by both father and mother. Seventy- 
four boys, children between 13 and 14 years of age, declared that their fathers drank, 
smoked, and never came home at night; 500 boys were said to be in the house of 
correction; 100in prison. These figures certainly show a very bad state of affairs; 
but we must remember that a city like Chicago grows by the influx of people from 
all parts of the earth, who are not always the worthiest. Tho following statements 
are much worse. In spite of all labor legislation and supervision of factories in the 
United States, certificates for permission to work are given to children who should be 
going to school. In Chicago, during one year, such certificates were given to 1,077 
children, 484 of whom were girls; 98 of these children were 10 years old; 115, 11 
years old; 342,12 years; and 522,13 years old. The reasons why certificates for per-

mission to work were given in these cases were because the children were poor, or 
orphans, or had been abandoned by parents, and, most frequently, that the boy might 
not become addicted to intemperance. We must read such numbers to understand 
how beneficial and necessary the temperance movement in America is. 
Let us leave the city and return to the country in general: In 1890, 22 per cent of 
the population of the United States, 14,500,000 pupils, attended school; of these 96.5 
per centreceived an elementary education. We, as teachers, aremoved almost to envy, 
when we consider the number of school days in a year in the United States. The 
annual average is only 134.3, I believe in Berlin we have no less than 240. Satur- 
days are holidays throughout America. The 134school days arean average of terms = 
varying greatly in different States. In the North Atlantic States, for instance Massa- 
chusetts and New York, there are 166 days in a school year; in the South Atlantic 
States, for instance Maryland and Virginia, 97; in the South Central States, for 
instance Tennessee and Kentucky, 88; and in the Western States, 135 days; New 
Jersey averages the greatest number of school days, 192; and North Carolina the 
least, 59; Illinois has 148. 
The obligatory course ostensibly requires an attendance of cight years, from the 
sixth to the fourteenth year. The course of the so-called primary school covers the 
first four years; the primary school prepares for the grammar school, the course of 
which likewise requires four years. In round numbers, 12,697,000 pupils out of the 
62,500,000inhabitants of the Union attended these elementary schools during 1890. Of 
these 12,697,000 only 8,144,000 children attended every day of the average 88 to 185 
school days; that is to say, only 64 per cent. attended regularly. Every day of the 
average 135 days, 36 out of every 100 pupils, or 1 of every 3, a very large proportion, 
missed school. The best attendance is found in Massachusetts. In that State it is 
73.7; in South Carolina, 73.4; and in New Mexico, 80 per cent. But this happy State 
has only 63 days in a school year. To forma just estimate of the general statistics 
referring to attendance at school, proper allowances must be made for the greater or 
fewer number of school days in the year. * * * 
According to available statistics, the schools of Minnesota are the ones in which 
attendance is poor the number of school days during the year are 120, and only 
45 pupils out of every 100 attend. This is probably too small an average, for Minne- 
sota, I believe, possesses excellent schools. Even in a State as old as Maryland, in 
which Baltimore is situated, only 55 out of every 100 pupils attended school regu- 
larly. In the United States the average number of days with a full attendance were 
86 out of the 134—namely, a proportion of 40 days nonattendance toevery pupil. In 
North Carolina the number of days of full attendance averaged 387 out of 59; in 
Massachusetts 135 out of 177; in the District of Columbia (tho city of Washington 
with its suburbs) 135 out of 178; in New York 115 out of 186, and in Illinois 107 
out of 148. 
The average attendanco at school throughout the United States covers four of the 
eight years; in large cities five to six years; in the South sometimes only one year, 
occasionally a few months only. This circumstance easily explains the policy of 
many cities in omitting all studies not absolutely nece y, eventually limiting the 
course to the three R’s—“‘reading, ’riting and ’rithmetic.” 
Permit me to dwell for 2 moment upon the system of these American schools., It 
is characteristic of the United States that in spite of its vast extent a certain uni- 
formity prevails. The different elements of immigration have notimpeded the devel- 
opment of a certain uniform national character; neither have the different languages 
prevented a uniformity of language. So all schools, notwithstanding their being 
affairs of the communities, are still governed by a certain uniform system modeled 
after the English. The first four years, from the sixth to the tenth year of age, are 
passed at the primary schools corresponding to our elementary schools; the following 
four years, from the tenth to the fourteenth year of age, at the grammar schools 
(similar to advanced Volksschulen), succeeded by the high schools im which foreign 
       
 
-P-A-G-E-574
  564 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
languages are begun. It is impossible for a public school pupil to learn foreign 
languages before the age of 14 or 15 years; until then all language lessons are devoted 
to the mother tongue. German is taught only in localities where there are a great 
many Germans, and then under aseparate superintendent; lately, the Irish majority 
in the city councils has suppressed this superfluity. 
Four years likewise are required to pass through the grades of the high school, 
from the last grade of which pupils are admitted into academies, universities, and 
special high schools. Primary, grammar, and high schools form a clear and simple 
system. The divisions of the course, or “terms,” of the first two are usually annual, 
those of the high school semiannual; the one prepares for the other. As I have 
already said, the majority of pupils do not go to school more than four years, and 
hence do not pass beyond the primary school. There are only a few private elemen- 
tary schools, and instruction is seldom given at home. In certain districts there are 
numerous Catholic and Protestant parochial schools, which include religious instruc- 
tion given in no public school of the United States, as church and state are entirely 
separate and independent. Protestant parochial schools are mostly German, and 
generally excellent; where Germans predominate in large districts they also have 
their own good normal schools. 
To understand the social position of teachers, men and women, it is of great 
importance to know the relation of the sexes in American schools, both of teachers 
and pupils; this is connected with the question of the position of woman in America, 
a question beyond my purpose to discuss. 
No distinction in the quality, kind, and aim of instruction is made in any of the 
elementary schools for boys and girls. In the old States, the sexes are not as a rule 
instructed together in secondary schools, but in the Central and Western States they 
sit together from the primary school to the university included. This is the system 
of coeducation, the education in common for both sexes so highly commended by 
Americans. At the Congress of Education at Chicago this subject was often dis- 
cussed; and not one disapproving voice was heard. At first, I was altogether 
misunderstood, when I explained that our views on the education of girls differ 
essentially from those of Americans. They see only the advantages of coeducation, 
believed to cultivate boys, and strengthen girls; and we must accept those peculiar 
conditions, just as in domestic life the intercorrse of boys and girls, adults as well 
as children, is altogether different from what it is among us; and I doubt its having 
amoral advantage, Certain it is, however, that the girls on the average are more 
intelligent than the boys; they go to school longer. In the high schools (corre- 
sponding to gymnasia and realschulen) of Chicago the proportion of girls to boys 
was 3to2. As business and politics take up the men’s entire time, the women have 
become the supporters of the higher intellectual interests and the protectors of 
intellectuality in domestic life. 3 
There are many more women than men teachers; in fact, the latter are so rare that 
the word “teacher” in school reports is considered of feminine gender. In the year 
1890 the large number of 363,935 teachers were employed in the public schools of 
the United States; of them 238,333 were women, so that the percentage of male 
teachers was only 34.5 In the North Atlantic States, like New York and Massa- 
chusetts, only 20 per cent of all the teachers are men; women teach even in the high 
schools. Had I not been accustomed to similar experiences in England, I should 
have been more amazed to hear Cicero’s speech for Milo interpreted to the pupils of 
a Latin class presided over by a young lady, or to see 30 young ladies working away 
at integral calculus under the direction of a female professor. The teachers’ roll—I 
speak of Chicago, because in that city I had the opportunity of studying everything 
in detail—has few men’s names. Of 100 “college” graduates admitted to the univer- 
sity only 20 were young men; the other 80, young ladies; hence, as far as intelligence 
can be extracted from books or procured at school, the women are ahead of the men. 
Out of 3,000 teachers I counted about 200 men; the names were not separated in 
 
-P-A-G-E-575

the list. Even the influential positions, up to that of school commissioner itself, are 
not seldom filled by women. 
When, after a long interim, a city normal school was reorganized in Chicago last 
summer, 149 young ladies and only 1 young man applied for admission. Male teach- 
ers predominate only in the States with a large negro population; so in the Southern 
States we find 60 per cent male to 40 per cent female teachers. 
Ina great many communities male and female teachers draw the same salaries. 
Equal pay is given for the equal work demanded. Another question of interest to 
us is, why so few men become teachers, The principal reason is that the remunera- 
tion is so very moderate in proportion to the cost of living and to what can be earned 
in other professions; moreover, a teacher rarely acquires celebrity. In America there 
-isno profession of teaching; teachers do not continue to be teachers; they are rather 
dependent, as a rule, and are not much thought of. Most teachers of public schools 
accept their positions as a transient stage; we often read in the lives of prominent 
Americans that they taught in their youth. The long school vacations are made use 
of to prepare for the university, or to study law or medicine, the two favorite pro- 
fessions in America. Naturally, there is a paucity of experienced teachers. 
In Illinois it was proven that of the 25,000 teachers in the State the average 
time of service was four years. The majority, male and female, are young begin- 
ners; female teachers are also found in the Central and Western States, where there 
are fewer women than men. | Liberty in all business relations is so great that men 
will not remain in other than high, well-salaried positions. We must bear in mind 
that permanent positions to which a pension is attached are not known in America. 
The army, independent of politics, is the only institution with permanent positions 
which has a most admirable corps of officers. Teachers are appointed on time; and 
in many States only for a year at first, and this is done on principle. Practically, 
the rule is not so strictly observed; there are teachers who maintain their posi- 
tions, always presupposing that great political changes will not influence municipal 
authority; here we meet the greatest evil of the whole public school system of the 
United States—the influence of politics upon schools; teachers, and educational 
affairs to their minutest details, are often affected by political changes. 
In many cities the administration and superintendence of schools, the appoint- 
ment of teachers, and promotions are purely political questions. Change of party 
rule often brings about a change of the whole personnel of schools, from ‘commis- 
sioners and superintendents down to the ranks of the teachers. This, together with 
other things, creates a want of stability in American schools; there are no traditions 
of pedagogic experiences, neither in a school nor ina city. How different in Ger- 
many! What an abundance of traditions and pedagogical experiences are collected 
ina normal school one hundred years old! In America hasty experiments replace 
the slow growth in Germany. The new principal, the new member of the school 
board, and the new-administration, are too impatient to carry out their political and 
moral views and ideas during their term of service. No one has time to finish his 
work, for he does not know how long he may be engaged init; but everybody experi- 
ments. On the other hand, this constant changing is an advantage to education; 
nowhere outside of America are new ideas more easily brought to light and put 
into practice. In Germany and other European States a whole life must be devoted 
to carrying out a single wholesome idea, In America any capable man soon finds a 
city, a school, or an endowed institution that permits him to realize his pedagogical 
idea. 
To merely touch the question of normal training of teachers in a word, Americans 
themselves best know that, on the average, it is still inadequate. The minority of 
teachers are educated at normal schools. The ever changing board, the superintend- 
ent, or occasionally a lower official, often influenced by politics, decides upon a 
teacher’s capacity. A definite educational policy is not prescribed, and there is 
no uniform examination. Every city or county is at liberty to determine its own 
   
-P-A-G-E-576
566 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  standard, be ic high or low. A preparation in pedagogics for the profession is 
almost entirely wanting; in fact, the principle has been enunciated that a teacher 
in the public schools need not know more than he must teach, and that.a knowledge 
of his text-book is sufficient. Primary school teachers often have not studied 
beyond the grammar school; ‘sometimes they even speak faulty English. 
I very well know that America has excellent institutions and brilliant teachers, 
but we must not look only at the flower so willingly held out to us. We must not 
limit ourselves to cities renowned for their scl.ools ; we must ask how matters are in 
general. According to the judgment of a very competent American school-teacher, 
the work done in normal schools does not compare with that of a German seminary. 
Pedagogically and scientifically restricted, the teacher naturally becomes dependent. 
The principal and inspector instruct him weekly and even daily, prescribing the 
daily lessons in every detail. Thus the opinion gains credence that the achieve- 
ments of a school are attributable to the board and inspectors, and not to the 
teachers. Teachers must first be prepared. 
There is no professional body of teachers with determinative power, no faculty 
meetings that have decisive disciplinary and other powers. In many cities the 
teacher is a poor day-laborer who earns his bread in sorrow and ‘ear of the Damo- 
cles sword of loss of position which hangs over his head. In the whole country 
there is no profession of teaching which rests on an average uniform education, the 
consciousness of professional work and its magnitude; the nation, as such, does not 
recognize it. Teachers have no representative corporation; what we hear of the 
national association of teachers and the great congresses are, with very few excep- 
tions, all efforts emanating from secondary and higher schools, in which only princi- 
pals, inspectors, etc., participate. This deficient professional preparation of the 
public school teacher is, next to political influence, the most vulnerable point of the 
whole American school system. It is evident that the achievements of even a 
highly gifted people must fall below a high standard under such a régime. 
The schools in the cities are usually ‘under the direction of a board of education, 
appointed according to the city statutes, either directly by popular election or indi- 
rectly by the mayor or judges, these personages being considered less likely to be 
influenced by party prejudice. The members of the board also may be appointed 
. by individual magistrates. * * * The best arrangement seems ‘to be found in 
cities, like Indianapolis, where the mayor appoints the board of education that 
elects a superintendent, and in large cities, his assistants. The entire work of the 
school falls upon them; they are often professors, but just as often men who have 
practiced other vocations. The chief superintendent in Chicago was formerly a 
lawyer, Dr. Lane, a very capable man, and specially enthusiastic in educational 
work, es 
Good school inspectors or superintendents do not stay long in one position. In 
the first place, they are politically dependent; secondly, larger salaries and other 
greater inducements draw them from one city to another. In many cities the gen- 
eral condition of schools and their administration is in a transition state, in conse- 
quence of which no pedagogic tradition or habits of administration can be formed 
in the schools, * * * 
Permit me to say a few words on the pecuniary circumstances of American teach- 
ers. The entire school expenditure of the city of Chicago, with a population in 
1892 approximating 1,614,000, amounted to $4,015,000, or 16,800,000 marks. Twoand 
a half million dollars, considerably more than one-half, was appropriated for sala- 
ries. Salaries of principals of grammar schools are divided into groups proportion- 
ate to the number of classes and pupils in their schools and the amount of work to 
be done. Tho first group of principals of grammar schools receive $1,050 the first 
year and the salary increases every year until it amounts to $1,200. The second 
group ranges from $1,200 to $1,400, the third group from $1,400 to $1,600, and the 
highest group from $2,300 to $2,500. 
 
-P-A-G-E-577
  GERMAN CRITICISM OF AMERICAN EDUCATION. . 567 
Principals of primary schools begin with $1,050 and never receive more than 
$1,600. In a city like Chicago, where a workingn:an receives on an average of $2a 
day, men and women teachers in pri gin with $400, or 1,620 marks, 
for the first year. The second year they receive $475; the third, $575; the fourth, 
$650; the fifth, $700; the sixth and the following 1s, $775; i.e., teachers can 
receive as high as 3,250 marks—a proportionately small sum considering the neces- 
sity of the position, with no pension, no provision for widows, etc., attached. 
Teachers in grammar schools are somewhat better situated; they receive $150 the 
first year, then $525, increasing in eight years to $800, or about 3,350 marks. Sub- 
stitutes receive $1.50 a day, after they have been tried six months. The so-called 
school cadets—pupil teachers in fact, whose employment was a necessity in years 
past in Prussia—also receive 75 cents a day for their work, which they perform under 
the supervision and guidance of a regular teacher. When we compare the purchas- 
ing power of a mark and a dollar, we understand that small salaries are the reason 
the teacher’s profession receives so few accessions. 
Two years ago, after a number of contradictory views and opinions had been 
expressed on the school system of the United States, a popular New York magazine, 
The Forun, instituted inquiries on its own account. Dr. Rice, who had studied 
under Professor Rein in Jena, and acquainted himself with educational matters in 
America, was commissioned to visit the larger cities in order to investigate their sys- 
tem, administration, and educational conditions. He visited 36 cities of the Union. 
Every city considers its schools and school buildings the best. It is an excellent 
arrangement that anyone professionally interested can unceremoniously enter Ameri- 
can schools at any time. ‘‘We have nothing to conceal, and are always ready to 
learn from you,” was said to me. 
Dr. Rice’s tour of inspection resulted in a book on the public school system of the 
United States in 1893. It contains a most unbiased and exact representation of the 
conditions of certain schools, together with their administration, as he observed them. 
The cities are mentioned, but not the names of the schools and teachers. It is an 
excellent book, containing everything that the author himself saw and experienced. 
And we must remember that he is a modern educator of the Herbartian school, one 
of the numerous younger American men who passionately and zealously apply psy- 
chological principles to education. 
The publication of his book caused an unpleasant ere, because he laid his 
finger on many an open wound. We know that America in education, as in every- 
thing else, is a land of contradictions; the very latest psychological methods are 
practiced together with the most antediluvian methods. At present two pedagog- 
ical currents are opposing each other in American public schools; the old so-called 
“arvill method,” based upon very meager but fixed knowledge oat by strict 
discipline and persistent cramming, and the new psychological method, which, based 
on a thorough understanding of a child’s mind, begins with its first ideas, and con- 
tinues to add others with the purpose of developing a harmonious education of the 
whole being, the moral and physical as well as the intellectual. 
Even though the new current has added manual training, hygiene, and a knowl- 
edge of civil government to the curriculum of study, and improved the scientific 
course; even though it advocates mild instead of harsh measures in dealing with 
pupils, still it can not be said that the old method is entirely without justification. 
We can not altogether condemn those who think that Americans need a different 
kind of school. I most assuredly lean to the newer methods. 
Dr. Rice mentions in his book that the worst public schools in regard to method 
and organization are those of Baltimore, Buffalo, Cincinnati, New York, Milwaukee, 
St. Louis, Chicago, and Boston. It is surprising that Boston should be mentioned. 
In the Neue Lehrerzeitung of July, 1893, Marcus Fuchs describes the Boston school 
system as being excellent; but I missed a thorough statement on elementary educa- 
tion in that article which would support the praise bestowed. What Dr. Rice says in 
regard to the location and sanitary conditions of certain schools in the far-famed city 
         
 
-P-A-G-E-578
568 - EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  of Boston is, in truth, astonishingly bad. However good the secondary and gram- 
mar schools are, improvement seems wanted in the elementary schools. Washing- 
ton, Springfield, and Quincy form a better group. The last mentioned has for a long 
time been a kind of American Mecca for educational pilgrims. (A number of years 
ago I first learned, from’ an American teacher of the Quincy method, concentration of 
instruction in certain studies.) Under the new administration, however, its schools 
seem to have retrograded. Indianapolis, Minneapolis, St. Paul, and particularly La- 
porte, Ind., possess the best public schools, according to Dr. Rice. In Indianapolis 
the good conditions of public schools is ascribed to the fact that the mayor appoints 
the school board, that the sensible action of the citizens is not influenced by polities, 
and that good teachers are introduced from other cities. Laporte is a small city in 
Indiana with only 40 teachers; but a famous educator is superintendent here. The 
name of Dr, W. N. Hailmann is conspicuous in congresses and the educational press. 
The excellencies of the schools at Laporte are very great, particularly in natural 
history, drawing, and English. They showed it at the World’s Fair and they are 
excellent at home. 
The best normal school is probably the Cook County Normal School in Englewood, 
near Chicago, under the direction of Colonel Parker. Next to this normal institute 
the College for the Preparation of Teachers, in New York, deserves mention. Irecom- 
mend this book of Dr. Rice to all who wish to acquaint themselves with American 
methods of teaching. Almost incredible instances are cited. For instance, an Amer- 
ican teacher in teaching geography asks: ‘‘ What senses are brought into action dur- 
ing the geography lesson?” ‘The children answer: “Hearing, for the teacher speaks; 
sight, for we look on the map; touch, for we point with our finger to the things.” 
Teacher: ‘(We will close our atlas; how many senses do you make use of now?” 
Answer: “Hearing,” ete. That was the beginning of a geography lesson! Here is 
another example. A class in the second grade is to read a short piece, and the 
teacher having run aground on a method, says to herself: ‘“‘In reading we must 
enunciate clearly and with expression.” As a preparatory exercise for distinct 
enunciation all the children must begin by practicing the vowels aloud, with the 
proper position of the vocal organs. Furthermore, the tongue must be relaxed, so 
the 50 children stretch out their tongues, and move them to the teacher’s beating 
time. Thereupon the teacher says: “You have done that very well; now we shall 
practice expression. Heads back!” All the 50 children throw their heads far back. 
Teacher: “Now say, ‘I am proud, for I know wholam.’” The children do as they 
are told, Teacher: ‘‘Heads on the left shoulder! Look upward! Speech: ‘How 
beautiful that is!’” (Expression of astonishment.) ‘‘Heads on the right shoulder! 
‘Do you think you can mock me?’ Heads down! ‘All my money is gone!’” 
Imagine a whole class saying, ‘‘All my money is gone,” to practice the expression 
of sorrow. Finally, a few other exercises to express increasing pleasure. Teacher: 
“Children, pay strict attention! What would you say if you were to receive an 
orange now?” All smile. “If you had a banana?” Broader smiles. ‘If you 
were to get a piece of candy?” Laughter. ‘‘Butice cream?” Shouts of laughter. 
“So,” says the teacher, “‘now the class is prepared to read the piece.” Of course 
the children read with expression; that is to say, every child in the worst possible 
manner of mimicry reads the story in which Katie says to Molly: ‘‘Be very good 
while I am gone, and do not get into mischief.” 
Such are two of the numberless examples cited by an impartial man, who can have 
no interest in defaming the schools of his country, but who is honest enough to say, 
im the face of local patriotism, how matters stand. In Chicago this publication 
awakened painful surprise. 
Of course, he mentions other and excellent achievements found in Minneapolis, 
Indianapolis, and Laporte, and specially in regard to the education of the pupil in 
self-observation, drawing from nature, and illustrating what he has learned. For 
instance, the pupil reads aloud, and writes on any subject of natural science; and 
writing a composition, illustrating it neatly.

GERMAN CRITICISM OF AMERICAN EDUCATION. 569 
Imust break off here. To what conclusion do we come? America, throughout, 
shows itself to be a young, unfinished country, with power, strong will, and great 
aspirations, a country of irreconcilable contradictions in which inexplicable things 
are tossing about, but a country which is united with the best possible spirit, and is 
free and open to every new thought. Still, I believe that we Germans have no reason 
to be envious of the school system of America.    
THE EXHIBIT OF RESULTS OF MANUAL TRAINING. 
By Prof. SrrpHuan WAETZOLDT, of Berlin. 
THIRD LECTURE. 
Lapies AND GENTLEMEN: Allow me to remark, by way of introduction, that your 
honored president selected a subject for me to discuss which is so extensive that 
when I received the announcement I was frightened. I am sorry not to have enough 
material gathered to do justice to the subject as announced: “Report on the exhibit 
of the results of manual training in all the countries of the civilized world.” -I can 
do no better than to consult my notebook and draw upon my memory for what I saw 
in the World’s Fair at Chicago, in order to offer a report on the present status and 
the methods of manual training in some countries. I shall supplement it by a 
statement of what I witnessed myself in American schools. 
When the minister of public instruction planned the great German educational 
exhibit the question arose, ‘Shall manual training be included?” Butafter consid- 
ering the fact that this branch of educational work is not a legal part of school 
education in Prussia, that it is not a regular branch of study, but is left to private 
initiative, it was resolved to leave it out, as had been done with the kindergarten 
display. Still, it seemed desirable to show to the Americans what is being accom- 
plished in this branch, for they would be apt to presume that he who fails to exhibit 
either has nothing to exhibit or shuns competition, his achievements being inferior. 
Hence it was determined to exhibit merely in a few groups what is done in this 
direction inGermany. Your president, Mr. yon Schenkendorff, was able, in his usual 
energetic way of acting, to collect in a very brief period of time, a beautiful exhibit 
of results of manual training for Chicago. Several of you saw it last February, 
when it was exposed to view in the House of Deputies. There it occupied two 
halls. It was of course out of the question to obtain as much room in Chicago as 
that for only one branch of our exhibit, hence a selection was made. From the 
Berlin and Gérlitz workshops for pupils we selected a number of objects of pupils’ 
work in paper, pasteboard, wood, wood carving and joiner work, which illustrated 
the course of instruction and the aims to be reached. I am sorry to say it was 
impossible to take with us the whole of the beautiful collection of the normalschool 
for manual training teachers in Leipzig, which was designed to show the assistance 
manual training can render the regular school instruction; but finally we made a 
judicious selection from this collection. 
In Chicago this exhibit found room in a very suitable place in the passage between 
the galleries occupied by secondary and elementary schools. There we spread the 
work on three enormously large tables in eight glass-covered cases, where they 
were kept safe from dust and moisture during the entire summer. The objects were 
systematically arranged and marked by English and German labels. It was not 
possible to place everything side by side, hence we had to arrange them in several 
tiers, one above the other. We supplemented the actual work by abundant techni- 
cal literature, annual reports, programmes, etc. Adjoining these tables was the 
exhibit of the Realschule in Bockenheim that had been admitted by permission from 
the minister of instruction. It contained photographs of the shops and specimens 
of joiner and pasteboard work. This collection received also an award. 
It was fortunate that we had specimens of pupils’ work in manual training on 
exhibition, for as the first question was invariably, “Where is the written work of 
 
-P-A-G-E-580
  570 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
your elementary schools?” the second invariably followed, ‘‘ Where is your manual 
training work?” That proved that much attention is bestowed in America upon 
this subject, and that in America the custom is still in vogue to look upon Germany 
as the leader in educational movements. Other questions were asked, such as ‘‘Is 
manual training gencrally introduced?” ‘How many schools do not give manual 
training?” ‘Is manual training obligatory in the elementary schools?” “At what 
age is it begun?” ‘What is tho course, the end to be attained, the number of 
hours devoted to it?” ‘Do the communities furnish tools, apparatus, and material 
free of cost?” In America the expenditure for this branch is borne by the com- 
munity, though it is not large as yet. Where manual training is introduced the 
authorities furnish everything needful—shops, tools, and materials. 
The opinion of American cducators of our manual training exhibit was, on an 
average, very favorable. We were told that the German course of instruction was 
methodically clear, the work on exhibition very good, carefully and tastefully 
executed. The Americans do not work as neatly and elegantly. They do plain 
work, as is seen in their machines. Where Frenchmen and Germans build in fine, 
ornate lines, the Americans build on a large scale, strong and as simple as possible. 
This tendency to quick and simple production, which does not permit the objects to 
appear elegant like ours, was noticed everywhere. Our wood carving (the so-called 
scallop-cut design) made the deepest impression upon the beholders, in view of the 
early age of the pupils who had made it. The taste, the sense of beauty, in the 
combination of models and their execution, was very pleasing to Americans. But 
they missed larger work, especially that which is immediately applicable, as, for 
instance, work o2 a wagon that needs repairing; work such as a farmer would need 
to perform whose plow is broken, or work done in the house in repairing broken 
furniture. The American training, especially in agricultural colleges in the Central 
States, is intended to a certain extent to enable farmers to repair their agricultural 
implements and to uso the saw, plane, and forging hammer. 
Our work was praised for its underlying systematic course, its clear methodical 
treatment, and its artistic execution. Another difference between German and 
American manual training was observed in this, that the American boys are fur- 
nished half-finished material prepared by the machine; Americans deem it waste of 
labor to do by hand what may be done by machines. Hand work is confined to that 
which can not be done by machines. This naturally gives to manual labor a higher 
value; it is ennobled when removed from the mere mechanical part, and is conse- 
quently better paid for. 
In my notebook, under date of May 28, I find a memorandum of a visit to our 
exhibit by a Brooklyn expert who declared that he had never scen such artistic 
pupils’ work. His countrymen were not deficient in well-defined methods, but 
they experimented too much. ‘‘It is true,” he said, ‘‘ that manual training is intro- 
duced in many cities, but their results are chiefly used for show purposes.” So, you 
see, ve may claim to have met with success; but it is my personal impression. that 
the good opinions of our German manual training work are too favorable, and I 
arrived at that conviction when I saw what other nations had accomplished. 
That our pupils’ work was considered characteristic is proved by the fact that the 
exhibit of the Society for Manual Training was one of the first objects purchased 
by the Americans. Professor Wilson, of Phifadelphia, bought it for the school 
museum of that city; also the literature belonging to it was’ bought. In Philadel- 
phia our small exhibit is to receive a place side by side with the Japanese, Russian, 
and French work. 
Before I turn to the exhibit of pupils’ manual work from American and other 
States, I desire to touch upon questions such as “What is the natural talent of the 
Americans for such work? What is their system? What circumstances have essen- 
tially aided in developing manual training?” An Englishman, Mr. Mather, of Man- 
chester, says in his report on technical education in the United States, ‘ All Ameri- 
 
-P-A-G-E-581
GERMAN CRITICISM OF AMERICAN EDUCATION. 571 
cans have more or less talent for manual labor; this is a characteristic of the race.” 
During the colonial period, or at the beginning of the settlement of the extensive 
West, they lived far apart, not together in cities and villages, hence they were 
obliged to perform all kinds of labor themselves. In consequence of the habit of 
self-activity manual work and skill have always been held in higher estimation, 
generally, than in Europe. A second reason is that the entire school system is 
erganized essentially upon practical principles. It aims at that which is applicable 
in life, or immediately useful. Such things the American understands first of all. 
Manual training has not been engrafted upon the schools, but is considered a useful 
and naturally grown branch of education. The educational and ethical side of the 
question is taken into consideration afterwards. 
The large American educational journals have taken cognizance of the subject and 
discuss it freely. Thus in the Journal of Education of 1893, for instance, we find a 
series of articles on joinery, and other comprehensive presentations of certain parts 
of manual training, with exact illustrations. When at first teachers were wanting 
for this instruction the authorities helped themselves in other ways by employing 
artisans. The American looks sharply about himself in this werld, and whenever 
he finds anything good he tries to acquire and develop it. Hence he isever ready to 
make educational experiments. During the last ten years manual training has grad- 
ually entered the public graded schools and progressed rapidly. 
Two currents are noticeable in American manual training. The first follows the 
principle that manual training should be a part of every division of education begin- 
ning with the kindergarten. The kindergarten forms in America the basis of the 
entire public school system, and is closely linked with the ideas of Froebel. The 
name of Froebel is nowhere pronounced as often as on the other side of the Atlantic, 
Starting from Froebel’s idea of occupation, games, manual work in paper folding, 
stick laying, modeling, etc., begin in numerous kindergartens. It is a peculiarity 
of the American school that modeling is begun with very young children; first, 
sand is used, then clay, and it is continued side by side with instruction in drawing 
through all the grades, and considered as necessary and important as instruction in 
scientific subjects. The entire instruction in manual work is facilitated and brought 
into organic connection with the other school work, by teaching drawing from the 
lowest grade upward throughout the course. We often find it said: Drawing is as 
necessary to a human being as writing; an educated man can not do without skill in 
drawing any more than without skillin writing. The ability to expose one’s thoughts 
in writing is not sufficient. The pupil must be educated to describe, sketch, model, 
and paint an object only if he is able to present it correctly; thus can he be said to 
have comprehended it fully. This connects the manual work organically with the 
other school work. In the higher classes we find wood carving, joinery, and light 
metal work that can be performed without the use of fire. To this must be added, 
that in many schools simple apparatus for instruction in physics is made by the 
pupils themselves under direction of the teacher. The American school has little or 
no use for our scientific and often very complicated appliances. 
At present all large cities in the United States have one or more public schools in 
which manual training is givenin a course of four to eight years. This is made an 
integral branch of study and occupies from two to four hours a week. The most 
extended observations concerning manual training seem to have been made in New 
York. Theviews entertained and the experience gained in that State go to prove that 
children who aré deficient in literary skill, and who are weak in language studies, are 
generally found more talented in manual-skill. Talent for mathematics, physics, and 
other natural sciences is generally coupled with manual dexterity. Dr. Adler, in 
New York, writes: ‘Boys who were considered stupid, and at last believe it them- 
selves, were soon found to be the first in manual skill in the workshop and in scien- 
tific instruction that required observation. They regained the respect of their 
fellow-students; and the success they achieve in manual training gives them back 
   
-P-A-G-E-582
    572 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
their self-respect, and spurs them on to do greater things. For this reason, if for 
no other, manual training should be made a part of all school instruction. It 
develops the mind of many a child that can learn but poorly from books.” He also 
claims to have noticed that manual work essentially aids the progress made in draw- 
ing and geometry; that relations of space, observed by both cye and hand simulta- 
neously, become clearer and more exactly understood. 
The second current noticeable in the manual training movement in America is to 
make manual work an essential part of secondary education. The high school (cor- 
responding in a measure to our secondary schools) should, it is claimed, exhibit not 
only as heretofore a bifurcation, but a trifurcation. As is done in France, the stu- 
dent when entering the high school elects his course of studying, either the scien- 
tific or classical course. Now, the reformers intend to institute a third branch or 
course, the so-called manual training high school. In these schools the thirty hours 
of work per week should be so divided as to give ten to manual training in shops 
and five to drawing. That is to say, the new school is not to be a trade school, but 
the manual training it offers shall, in the widest acceptance of the term, be the basis 
of general education, including English, mathematics, and modern languages. I 
shall, in the course of my remarks, return to this subject. 
‘The general movement in introducing manual training in the schools has become a 
very strong one. It has grown rapidly in the large cities; in Boston and New York 
it may be said to have become fashionable. In New York the opposition in the press 
and the public was at first very vigorous. Modeling in clay was said to be condu- 
cive to transmitting skin diseases; that standing at the workbench would cause 
crooked legs; the beys would not grow up straight; they would be educated to be 
artisans, a thing that was not desired. In New York, manual training was intro- 
duced in five city schools in 1888. The pupils who desired to take part increased 
rapidly, and in 1893 the city had 500 teachers for the manual training of 22,000 pupils 
who learned manual work. This number is not so great when you consider that 
girls who learn needlework and cookery are not counted in. But in some schools 
the boys, too, learn cooking, no difference being made in regard to the sex of pupils. 
Think of the increase: 500 teachers and 22,000 pupils in six years. New York has 
now in the large college for the training of teachers an institution where teachers 
are practically prepared for giving manual training. I have already mentioned the 
fact that in the models of work furnished in the American manual training schools 
a lack in artistic taste is noticeable. 
Permit me to give a brief statement of the exhibits of manual training from differ- 
ent States of the Union. First, I shall mention what occurs to me as having been 
exhibited by the Atlantic States, then by the South and Central States, in which 
manual skill is fostered. I found good ironwork from Baltimore; woodwork from 
the negro school in that city; wood and iron work from the manual training school; 
among the specimens on exhibit some machines built by students and apparatus 
were used in instruction in physics. Louisville exhibits excellent woodwork, both 
of wheelwrights and joiners, Then the three cities in which the public schools are 
said to be the best: the sister cities Minneapolis and St. Paul, Indianapolis, and 
Laporte, which, according to the Swedish system, had furnished a very good exhibit 
of pasteboard work, wood carving, and ironwork. From the more Western States 
remarkably good work was sent from Nebraska (Omaha) and Washington (Tacoma 
and Spokane). 
The Central and Southern States also exhibited manual work of pupils, and it 
was very obvious that objects and materials changed according to the needs of the 
country. From Mexico, the city of Puebla sent boys’ work which was made of 
onyx, a semiprecious stone. Argentine undoubtedly had the best exhibit of all the 
States in South America, only it was placed in a dark corner and was not seen by 
many. That collection showed excellent work in leather and other saddler’s work, 
also joiner’s work. This work was a specimen of what a country needs in which 
agriculture and stock raising is carried on.
-P-A-G-E-583
  GERMAN CRITICISM OF AMERICAN EDUCATION. 573 
Japan had furnished an exhibit in which one could see that, though the nation 
has developed in a peculiar and characteristic way, it is imitating Europe. The 
influence of Europe has become very strong. I saw very excellent needlework and. 
beautiful woodwork made in boys’ schools in Japan, after drawings from nature in 
Japanese fashion. Of the Australian States, New South Wales furnished charac- 
teristic work—that is, a collection of work in tailoring and dressmaking, simple 
garments such as are used on the farm. 
Lastly, I may mention the most remarkable points of the European and Asiatic 
exhibits. The French exhibit was small but very well selected. I received the 
impression that France has become our closest competitor in education generally, 
and especially in the elementary schools. I do not hesitate to admit that it is 
vastly superior to us in manual training. In America public opinion begins to 
change. French schools are thought by some to be superior to ours. A distin- 
guished American educator, Dr. Monroe, expressed this view without reserve, say- 
ing: ‘“‘The new ideas in education at present come more from France than from 
Germany; we must turn to France to become imbued with the spirit of modern 
times; itis from there we get new suggestions and ideas.” 
There was no dissenting voice in regard to drawing. In drawing the “Ecoles 
secondaires” of France are superior to all other schools. It is significant that the 
drawings made there are much larger than with us; so are the models. Caps of 
columns for instance, were drawn nearly of natural size. The best work was sent 
by the city of Poitiers. The city of Paris had its own exhibit of manual training 
in the state pavilion of France. This exhibit proved conclusively what a happy 
thing the French Government had done when it organically connected manual 
training and the continuation schools with the people’s or elementary schools. It 
thus enables the pupils to follow their own individual talent in selecting suitable 
professions and occupations. 
As to Russia, the Americans said: “In manual training Russia’ stands at the head 
of allnations.” If we take as a criterion the great number of schools in which 
manual training is offered, this praise is well earned. I do not know the Russian 
system of public instruction from observation, hence I refrain from expressing an 
opinion. But I do not hesitate to praise the Russian technique, especially the work 
in different kinds of wood and the work of the peasant schools. Military uniforms 
made in the orphans’ schools were exhibited. The girls’ schools, established by 
Empress Maria, exhibited remarkably excellent needlework. We also saw work in 
gold, engraving in silver and copper, not done in special or professional schools, but 
by boys in manual training classes. 
In Egypt we find instruction in manual work fashioned exactly and sensibly in 
accordance with the needs of the country. Side by side with editions of the Koran 
and bamboo penholders, we find work in cedar wood, done in the schools of Cairo; 
also the odd, inlaid work of mother-of-pearl and wood seen in the Orient, made by 
young boys. The schools of the ‘Alliance Israelite,” the influence of which is felt 
around the eastern Mediterranean, had exhibited from the Jewish schools in Tunis 
work in chasing on copper, in the style of that country. England exhibited very 
little. Only the school board of London showed wood and pasteboard work from 
elementary schools. But that England does not stand low in the scale of skilled 
workmanship is presumed from the fact that manual skill is vained very highly in 
England and America. Depreciation of manual labor as compared with mental 
labor is not found there; manual labor is not thought humiliating to anyone. A 
French observer, Max Leclere, who quite recently investigated the conditions of 
England, says that in nearly all English schools, from the elementary to the aristo- 
eratic ‘“‘public schools,” so called, manual training is offered; and he then points to 
the enormous importance this instruction must have for the progress in technical 
and industrial pursuits.

574 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  During the Exposition in Chicago congresses of education were held from July 17 
to 24, with moro than 120 sessions. Among these congresses was a department 
devoted to manual training, skillfully connected with that of art education of the 
young. The department held 12 sessions, 3 of which were in connection with the 
kindergarten congress. They were well attended, and the interest evinced in the 
subject of manual training was intense. From the great number of papers read I 
mention merely the most important: (1) Professor Richards, from the Pratt Institute, 
in Brooklyn, spoke on ‘‘The educational object of drawing and manual training ;” 
(2) President Walter Hervey, of the College for the Training of Teachers, in New 
York, spoke on ‘‘Manual training in the American system of schools” (this college 
has a special department for the training of manual training teachers); (3) Dr. 
Emil Hirsch, of Chicago, on “The ethical side of manual training;” (4) Prof. 
Gustav Térngren, of Stockholm, on “ The history of tools;” (5) Prof. Earl Barnes, of 
the Stanford University, at Palo Alto, Cal., on “Spontancous drawings of children.” 
This lecture was made exceptionally interesting by an exhibit of numerous chil- 
dren’s drawings found on the walls and fences and in exercise books. In them the 
individuality of the child’s seul in observation and reproduction of characteristic 
features in form and movement was illustrated. (6) Dr. Paul Carus, of Chicago, 
spoke.on ‘The philosophy of tools;” (7) Miss Mary T. Chapin, of Boston, on “‘Deco- 
rating the schoolrooms by the pupils themselves;” (8) Dr. Leipziger, of New York, 
on “Tho physiology of manual training in high schools;” (9) Miss Dora Hicks, of 
Boston, on ‘Color-sense of children.” 
Permit me to refer again, in a few words, to the peculiar manual training school 
in Chicago. It is called the English High ‘and Manual Training School, and is sit- 
uated on Monroe street. I made my visit to that school in company with Privy 
Councilor Dr. Bertram. We were both of the opinion that what we there saw was 
praiseworthy and new. The school was established by the Commercial Club in 1883, 
with the avowed purpose of fostering manual skill as an element of general culture 
during the high school years (14 to 18). In 1890 the city took charge of the school, 
numbering then about 260 students. In the northwest and southern portions of the 
city two more such manual training schools are being established. All the expenses, 
except a small feo for materials used by the pupils, aro defrayed by the city. In- 
struction is gratuitous. The course is one of three years. 
The studics in the first year are distributed as follows: Algebra, 4 hours a week; 
zoology (during 24 weeks), 4 hours a week; botany (during 16 weeks), 4 hours; 
American literature, 3 hours; composition and letter writing, 1 hour; free-hand and 
mechanical drawing, 5 hours; joinery and carpentry, turning, modeling, 10 hours. 
Information is also given concerning wood as material and as merchandise, 
In the second year the following course is pursued: Geometry, 3 hours per week; 
physics, 3 hours; universal history, 3 hours; English literature, 2 hours; composi- 
tion and business forms, 1 hour; free-hand and mechanical drawing, 5 hours; lessons 
in the workshops, learning to use the tools in smithing, forging, and welding, 10 
hours. Information is also given concerning iron as material and in commerce. 
In the third year: Trigonometry and higher algebra, 3 hours; constitution and 
political economy, 2 hours; English classics, 2 hours; mechanical and architectural 
drawing, together with free-hand sketches, 5 hours; construction and the use of 
machines, 10 hours. Besides, information is given concerning machines, their his- 
tory, construction, and cost. During the second and third years a certain number 
of optional studies are offered, for instance, German or French, instead of English. 
This high school is like other high schools in many respects. It graduates its 
students, for instance. A second and a third of this kind of school are soon ‘to be 
opened in ‘Chicago; manual training in them is not to be an ornamental branch, but 
one of the essentials. It is to occupy, together with drawing, 15 of the 30 hours per 
week. Manual work is not to be a gingerbread affair, but hard, serious work, under 
direction of thoroughly equipped artisans and technical experts. It appears to me 
that for manual work, skilled artisans and experts are preferred to academic teachers. 
     
-P-A-G-E-585
  
  “Theenthusiasm of the boys in this school in their manual work is quite obvious. 
We saw boys varying in age between 15 and 19 years. Most of them had passed 
through the first nine years of the primary and grammar school courses, and now 
occupied most of their time in working in wood and iron and in the machine shop. 
These young people executed their work zealously and skillfully; they exibited a 
feverish pleasure in laboring especially in the smith shop at the anvil. Material, 
and the tools used, are precisely as they are found in shops for ‘adults, not ‘‘in min- 
jature.” Quite a number of these students enter commercial and other practical 
occupations, but most of them enter technical pursuits. 
The expense to the city of Chicago for the maintenance of this school is quite con- 
siderable. The site of the building represents a value of $50,000; the building cost 
$27,000; the equipment $1,500. During the year 1891-92 the salaries paid the 
teachers alone amounted to $24,865, or 104,006 marks. The costs per capita were 520 
marks a year. The salary of the principal is $2,600:and that of the teachers. aver- 
ages $1,800. 
The Americans have here, in obedience to the popular demand for manual train- 
ing, developed a new and peculiar kind of secondary,school quite in harmony with 
their pedagogy, which places in the foreground that which is practical and imme- 
diately applicable. Their watchword is, “To know and to do,” that is to say, “It 
is well to know something, but we must also be able to perform, that is, apply our 
knowledge.” 
Mr. Constantin Nérrenberg, librarian of the University of Kiel, Germany, came to 
Chicago as the representative of his Government to act 2s commissioner of the Ger- 
man library exhibit. He attended the international congress of librarians, and was 
particularly active in examining the history and development.of the library move- 
ment in America. His report was published in the Centralblatt fiir Bibliothekswe- 
sen, vol. 11, 1894, Leipzig, and is worthy of perusal, since it gives a brief but good 
account of the congress of librarians, and is full of shrewd observations concerning 
the American public library. Mr. Nérrenberg succeeded in establishing an exchange 
with European libraries, particularly university libraries, which will doubtless result 
in enriching these institutions on both sides of the Atlantic, and make the public 
documents of Europe available to students of education, who hitherto have been 
troubled in securing desirable matter. 
THE CONGRESS AND THE CONFERENCE OF LIBRARIANS IN CHICAGO. 
Report by Mr. Constantin NORRENBERG, 
Librarian of tho University of Kiel, Germany. 
The first conference of librarians took place in New York September 15-17, 1853, 
forty yearsago. Its proceedings are reported in Norton’s Literary and Educational 
Register for 1854. Although intended to be an American gathering, it was, in a cer- 
tain sense, international, for two letters sent by French colleagues were read, one of 
which (from Alexander Vattemare) proposed an international exchange of State 
publications. A resolution to assemble at stated intervals was passed, but not car- 
ried out until many years afterwards, when a second conference was held in connec- 
tion with the World’s Exposition in Philadelphia (1876). This conference led to the 
organization of American experts by the formation of the American Library Associ- 
ation (A. L. A.). 
The next year, 1877, witnessed an international congress at London, in which 
America was comparatively better represented than the European continent. The 
Library Association of the United Kingdom (L. A. U. K.) was formed on that occasion, 
and since then the librarians of the two nations of the English tongue have held 
regular conferences, in which they possess an invaluable organ for the: exchange of 
experiences, the fostering of professional spirit, and the promotion of an institution 
of culture'to which they have devoted their lives. ae

  576 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93, 
The World’s Congress of Librarians in Chicago was not called together by the 
American professional librarians; it formed a part of the long series of world’s con- 
gresses that accompanied the World’s Fair, and constituted only a section of the 
literary congress, sharing with it the rooms of the Art Palace and the attention of 
the public. Naturally it fell to the A. L. A. to invite the colleagues of the world to 
this and to conduct the proceedings. Expediency suggested that the A. L. A. hold 
its own conference, the sixteenth annual, in connection with this congress, and it 
was but natural that the same persons attended both meetings. 
Only three foreign librarians were present: Peter Cowell, chief librarian of the 
public libraries of Liverpool; Miss Mary R. 8. James, librarian of the People’s Palace 
Library, London, and the writer of this account. Other well-known librarians 
present, all of the United States, were: G. H. Baker (Columbia College library) ; 
J. L, Tomkins (library University of the City of New York) and his first assistant, 
Charles A. Nelson ; Melvil Dewey (State library and the school of librarians in Albany, 
N. Y.), with his assistant, Miss Mary 8. Cutler, and the cataloguer, W. S. Biscoe; 
W.H. Brett (public library, Cleveland, Ohio); G. W. Cole (public library, Jersey City, 
N. J.); F. W. Crunden (public library, St. Louis, Mo.); C. A. Cutter (formerly of 
Boston library) and W. C. Lane (present chief librarian of the Atheneum, Boston, 
Mass.); W. I. Fletcher (Amherst College library); 8. 8. Green (public library, Wor- 
cester, Mass.); F. H. Hild (public library, Chicago, Ill.) and his assistant, E. F. L. 
Gauss; F. P. HiJl (public library, Newark, N. J.); J. K. Hosmer (public library, 
Minneapolis, Minn.); G. M. Jones (publie library, Salem, Mass.); Horace Kephart 
(Mercantile Library, St. Louis, Mo.); W.F. Poole (Newberry Library, Chicago, Ill.) ; 
R. B. Poole (Young Men’s Christian Association Library, New York). Among the 
ladies present there were, aside from those mentioned before, Miss Tessa L. Kelso 
(public library, Los Angeles, Cal.); Miss Cath. L. Sharp (Armour Institute, Chicago, 
Ill.); Miss Lodilla Ambrose (Northwestern University, Evanston, Ill.); Miss Zella 
Allen Dixson (University of Chicago); Miss Theresa West (public library, Milwau- 
kee, Wis.); Miss Jessie Allen (public library, Omaha, Nebr.). 
The publishing trade was represented by the firms of Messrs. Scribner’s Sons, 
B. Westermann & Co.,and G.E. Stechert, of New York, and A.C. McClurg & Co., of 
Chicago. Altogether 305 members were enrolled, 139 gentlemen and 166 ladies, of 
whom 91 gentlemen and 130 ladies belonged to the profession of librarians, in the 
strict sense of the term. Many persons not librarians, but chiefly ladies, listened to 
the proceedings of the World’s Congress, while the A. L. A. conference was apparently 
attended only by professional people, and that was evidently to the advantage of 
the conference, as was the selection of the place of meeting. 
The international relations of libraries aro still insignificant, and it was therefore 
impossible to prepare a programme for discussion, and distribute subjects among cer- 
tain professionals. The literary contributions that were sent in obedience to a gen- 
eral call were read in turn. Two foreign contributors to the programme, Cowell, of 
Liverpool, and Miss James, of London, read their own essays; of the other six foreign 
papers only the one sent by the editor of Centralblatt fiir Bibliothekswesen, in Leip- 
zig, Dr. O. Hartwig, was submitted; it was translated and read by E. F. L. Gauss. 
Hence we see that this World’s Congress had an Anglo American character, and 
the one institution, the predominance of which in number and importance consti- 
tutes the chief difference between the German and American system of book collec- 
tions, the public library—the people’s library—was the chief object of consideration. 
While in the A. L. A. conference the professional librarian spoke to his colleagues, 
in the World’s Congress the representatives of the people’s libraries spoke to non- 
professionals and patrons, and carried on a propaganda. 
President Dewey, doubtless the strongest impelling force in the library life of this 
country, in his opening address summarized the progress made by the public library 
and its idea, its position in the programme of national culture since the foundation 
of the A.L, A. He spoke with enthusiasm of the work of his colleagues and with

confidence of the problems of the future and their solution. Crunden pictured the 
librarian as an‘executive officer, and defined the requirements the profession of libra- 
rian demands. He must unite in himselfall the qualities of the business man, the 
scholar, and the gentleman. Cowell, of Liverpool, spoke of the methods of awaken- 
ing interest among the various classes of society for public libraries, and urged the 
use of them. He laid stress upon constantly reminding the public of the library and 
its available treasures, and suggested that they point out in the press in what partic- 
ulars the library might be improved. Miss James gave a history and description of 
the People’s Palace and its library, an institution of popular education, situated in 
the poorest part of London and performing a most beneficent work. Dr. Tirsch, 
chairman of the board of directors of the public library of Chicago, spoke of the 
public library and its influence on public education, saying: ‘‘The public library 
furnishes to the elector the means to form his own political opinion; it enables the 
citizen to educate himself in all directions; it informs him in regard to esthetics, 
ethics, or sociology. We are apt to underrate the literature of fiction when con- 
sidering it merely as a matter of entertainment, for this branch of literature contains 
works of high rank that open the eyes of man to the life of his own soul; a good 
novel is always a good teacher of worldly wisdom; and fiction therefore rightfully 
occupies a large space in our public library.” 
Mr. Cutter tried to define the character of the American library in a paper on “The 
standing of the American library.” ‘‘It is true,” ho said, ‘that our libraries are 
young and small; that we can not as yet use them for profound scientific investiga- 
tion; that in some of our libraries such investigation can scarcely be begun, and 
that comparatively modern and cheap books form their chief stock. But we have 
opened new ways and intend to offer to the public more than is offered in other 
countries. In our attempts to turn over and over a small stcck, to have circulated 
frequently a small number of books, to place every atom of information and instrue- 
tion in such a condition that it may be used, we have no superiors. Utilization 
and diffusion of knowledge are our leading ideas, and the highest mark in our 
testimonial.” 
Various circumstances combined to prevent a profound discussion of these papers. 
Tho effect will begin when they are published in the Library Journal, as is the 
intention.» The congress could not have a direct result in its environments but 
friends of international library congresses will not be discouraged by tho ineffec- 
tiveness of this congress. They will doubtless be fructifying if held independently, 
and will chiefly occupy the attention of the members with the subjects treated by 
the two German papers read in Chicago: The reciprocal relations of libraries between 
different countries. 
The conference of the A. L. A. concerned itself exclusively with American libra- 
ries, and strictly followed the programme prepared beforehand. In attempting to 
indicate in a few words the essential difference between American and German libra- 
ries, it is necessary to remember tho fact that the entire American system of cduca- 
tion is different from the German. 
The German university, as an institution for scientific investigation, has no equal 
in America, except the post-graduate courses following a four years’ college course, 
and found in only afew institutions of importance, such as Johns Hopkins Univer- 
sity, in Baltimore, Md., and Harvard University, in Cambridge, Mass. Generally 
colleges and universities confine themselves to transmitting knowledge, hence are 
only upper grades of secondary schools, which, in turn, are continuations of the 
elementary of public schools. Similar to this plan is the organization of libraries. 
Though they collect, for university professors and future generations of scholars, 
strictly scientific works (one need only remind us of the purchase of the libraries of 
Ranke, Zarncke and Lagarde), they bestow much more attention on text-books which 
make the prescribed knowledge accessible to the students. That it is not their plan 
to furnish the students with material for scientific research is proven by the rule that 
ED 93. 37 
   
-P-A-G-E-588
    bIS. EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
no student may borrow more than three volumes at one time. The public library, as 
Mr. Cutter during the proceedings of the conference occasionally remarked, runs 
parallel with the lower grades of education offered in kindergarten, elementary, and 
secondary schools. Another essential difference between the American and German 
libraries is that public libraries are more numerous and more effective, because they 
consider it one of their duties to attract the public to their rooms by all available 
methods, and, one is tempted to say, to urge and foree upon the public the intel- 
lectual treasures heaped up there. As the institutions of learning are organically 
connected, one building upoa what the other has done, so the difference between a 
university library and a public library is a comparatively small one in America; the 
general management of both shows great similarity. The intention to simplify the 
technical part of the management and to save labor is everywhere shown plainly, 
and is chiefly explained by the high wages paid for manual labor in America. The 
relative similarity in the objects in view among the various libraries has facilitated 
the coming together of librarians, and favored an organization for common labor 
and cooperation.    
The conference had a very comprehensive programme. The large, collective re- 
port on ‘Public libraries in the United States of America,” which was published 
by the Government in 1876 (in the foundation year of the A. L. A.), is to be replaced 
by a new one, which will exhibit the progress made in seventeen years through the 
A.L. A., aided by the work of foreign librarians, among which Graesel’s ‘¢Prin- 
ciples” are considered as occupying a prominent place in the opinions of Americans.' 
The work for this new volume was distributed and the various essays prepared. 
It was Dewey’s plan for the year’s conference to discuss and settle the points con- 
cerning whieh practice and views had not come to a definite conclusion. Yor that 
purpose the July, or World’s Fair, number of the Library Journal, contained brief 
extracts of these papers, where that in which all agree was separated from that 
which was still a subject of contention, and this journal was placed in the hands of 
members present. Hence papers to be read were not on the programme, but only | 
discussions of the themes presented. ‘‘ Wo therefore expect,” so the programme con- 
cluded, ‘that more will be accomplished in one session than could otherwise be 
done in three, and we hope to double the practical importance of our meeting by 
studying the library exhibit.” fs 
The proceedings were conducted in the usual forms; the gavel, as asign of the dig- 
nity of the chairman, was alternately in the hands of President Dewey and different _ 
former presidents; and to the chairman as the supposed umpire every speaker | 
addressed his words during the discussion. The latter proceeded as smoothly as _ 
could be expected in a meeting of experts, with reference to questions chiefly of a 
- practical nature, and in a language that tended to crispness and brevity. I must 
not neglect to state that the contributions to the discussion on the part of the 
ladies did not differ in brevity and positiveness from those of the gentlemen. — 
Often the senso of the meeting was found by raising the hands, or by viva voce vote, 
rarely to decide anything by numbers, but mostly to ascertain whether this, that, or 
another mode is being practiced and has proven satisfactory. | 
The proceedings, of which I do not intend to give a full account, but only charac-_ 
teristic features, showed at once in the discussion of the first subject, ‘Library and — 
school,” the almost unlimited liberality of the public library and its efforts to secure 
for itself a place as an indispensable institution of learning. The question was 
discussed how to interest the teachers in the library, so that they might encourage © 
the students to make uso of it? Experiences were exchanged. In one library the 
teachers are invited to take part in the meetings of the library clubs; at other 
places the superintendent of public schools is a member of tho library board; one 
library sends to the teachers collections of books for distribution among their pupils; 
      y S. Cutler says that: this is ‘the most important single publication on library economy since 
the Bureau of Education’s special report.” |

  GERMAN CRITICISM OF AMERICAN EDUCATION. a 
some give a number of copies of the same book to one class, so that all the pupils 
may read and discuss it in class; in other cities the librarians from time to time 
visit the schools and urge upon pupils and teachers the use of the library; two 
librarians induced students to write essays on the library. Tho restriction of works 
of fiction was rejected. Mr. Fletcher spoke most decidedly against any restriction, 
referring to the paper read by Mr. Hirsch in the Congress of Librarians. 
The question whether the public should be allowed access to the bookcases was 
discussed quite lively, and the advocates of that privilege defended their views with 
great zeal. “The public will be able to select its own reading matter; tutelage in 
this country is very unpopular.” In Cleveland, Ohio, the circulation rose from 
200,000 to 350,000 volumes, or about 60 per cent, after the public had been allowed 
access to the books. It is true that 300 books, valued at $300, were lost in one year, 
but salaries amounting to $2,000 had been saved. Miss Kelso, of Los Angeles, tells 
the people that the books belong to them and that the librarian only superintends 
their collection and distribution. Her experiences go to confirm the beneficial 
results of the new move. Miss Allan, of Omaha, said that the reading room of the 
library there contained 8,000 volumes, without supervision, and that during the last 
year not a single volume was Jost. The opponents to free access had in view chiefly 
libraries of less popular character containing more valuable literary treasures. 
A plan, under the title ‘Book annotation,” was submitted, which was equally 
important for the managers and users of libraries. It is this: A catalogue of about 
10,000 of the best works from all departments is contemplated, in which every book 
title is accompanied by brief characteristic notes from the pen of experts. This 
catalogue is to aid the librarian in the selection of books to be bought, and the 
reader in that of books to be read. The costs of this enterprise are estimated at 
$100,000, and it was proposed to raise this sum by a stbscription on the part of all 
institutions interested init. Dewey and others valued the saving of labor in the 
various libraries, and the value of protection from purchase of worthless books, 
much more. than the estimated cost. If the German reader will kindly remember 
that Amcrican book dealers and publishers do not send to the libraries copies of new 
books for examination, he will properly gauge the importance of such a guide. 
An attempt in this direction is made in preparing a catalogue for a model library 
of 5,000 volumes which form a part of the A. L. A. library exhibit. The selection of 
these books is the result of suggestions of more than a hundred librarians. The cata- 
logue of this model library contains tho titles without notes. Four little pamphlets 
have been prepared called New Aids for Readers, containing a small selection of the 
best works onclectricity, photography, American politics, and politicaleconomy, with 
notes characterizing their importance. 
In connection with this subject Mr. G. Iles, of New York, announced that at the 
beginning of 1894 a weekly index of magazine articles would appear which would 
repeat the weekly statements with additions, until at the closo of the term it would 
offer a summary. This enterprise is made possible through the linotype machine 
(Mergenthaler’s typesetting machine) that casts each line separately, so that the 
matter in type can be rearranged and used continually in every following number, ! 
at a merely nominal price. With reference to the “adaptation of the library to 
its readers,” Mr. Green, of Worcester, Mass., made some noticeable suggestions, but 
found strong opposition. He considered it advisable not to let libraries in small 
places grow beyond a certain limit; to dispose of dispensable books by assigning 
them to the next larger library, or by selling them, and rather make a small number 
of books useful by frequent reissue, and new editions of catalogues. He proposed   
!Tho Rudolph Indexer Company (Nation, August 31, 1893) plans the reprinting of the titles of all 
new works published in Americ This list can be had with any new work purchased. The samo is 
intended for books printed previous to 1893. In this list every book title is to be accompanied by notes 
with references¢o tho subject, index, and signatures according to Dewey's decimal and Cutter’s expan- 
sive system, and may be utilzed for the card catalogue as well as for tho Rudolph Indexer (a newly 
invented form of catalogue).

to this end a division of labor among the libraries, i. e., according to a well matured, 
comprehensive plan ; each library should select a special branch of literature, and aim 
ata complete representation of works in that branch. | 
Concerning the topic “Fire, security, and insurance,” Mr. R. B. Pool, of New 
York, reported that bricks had been found to be the best fireproof material; granite 
crumbled in fireif water was poured over it, and iron could be considered safe only _ 
if surrounded by brick. He thought it impracticable to insure libraries. The com- 
munity that owns the library is the best insurance company. The case was differ- 
ent with libraries established by means of private funds. Miss Allan, of Omaha, 
stated that she insured books for the time they were in the hands of the bookbinder, 
and the card catalogue of her library is insured to the amount of $5,000. 
The utility of “ Branch libraries and delivering” was then discussed. That prac- — 
tice plays an important réle in American cities which cover such great areas. There 
was unanimity concerning the value of branch reading rooms, but branch libraries 
would not pay, for the cost of these branch buildings might be better used to in- — 
crease the stock of books in the central library, and by rapid delivery to all parts of 
the city the library could be made more useful. Messrs. Fletcher and Green had a 
high opinion of the educative influence of branch libraries upon their environments. 
Minneapolis and Chicago had both met with success by following a mixed system. 
In the discussion of the next topic, ‘General management,” specific American con- 
ditions were presupposed: The trustees and the librarian’s relation to them; whether 
he is to be the secretary of the board; whether he is to manage the funds of the © 
library, and to that end give bond; his term of office—tha , Whether he is to be 
appointed for a number of years, or may retain his position during good behavior, 
as was the sense of the majority. The question of salary caused a lively debate; it 
was found that many librarians and assistants had a lower salary than principals 
in publicschools. It was claimed that the salary should be at least equal to that of — 
a school principal; a secondary education should be a requirement of admission to 
‘library service. 
Mr. Dewey here led the debate upon a higher point of view. ‘‘In our days a new 
kind of higher education has developed, whose foundation is the library. I mean 
the so-called university extension. It offers instruction for all conditions of life; 
for the home, for people whose time is occupied by business, for young and old, 
and the library is the fountain head of this new education. * * We see the 
‘library in a constant process of development. The idea of ancient times, when the 
reader had to storm a library like a fortress, has turned into the opposite.. The 
librarian of to-day is aggressive; he wants to turn over his stock of books as fast 
as the merchant his stock of trade. * * * Let ussay it openly that we are doing 
a great work and may demand recognition accordingly.” Mr. Crunden compared 
the position of the librarian with that of the president of a university, and required 
for the head of a library similar qualifications. Mr. Dewey seconded this by refer- 
ring to Justin Winsor, the head of the library at Harvard, who is not second to the 
president of any American university. 
The discussion of the best mode of ‘buying books,” in which the booksellers 
present took part, presupposed conditions very different from those prevailing in 
Germany. In regard to purchasing foreign books, Mr. Brett, of Cleveland, Ohio, 
remarked that at one time he had to order a large number of German books, and he 
had divided the order between a New York importer and a German firm. ‘The prices 
had been almost alike, but the New York agent had been much more prompt in 
supplying the books. 
Mr. Dewey reported that for the purpose of utilizing duplicates, he had arranged 
a sort of clearing house in the State library at Albany, which is used by all the 
libraries of the State of New York. They send unnecessary books to this clearing 
house, where they are estimated by an official of the State library, and may then 
select from the collection of duplicates books of an equal value in money. We 
      
   
      
     
-P-A-G-E-591
  GERMAN CRITICISM OF AMERICAN EDUCATION. 581 
also say to the officials of small libraries: “If you will send us with your dupli- 
cates a list of what you have, we ean select from our stock of duplicates those which 
will best complete your library.” 
The subject of ‘Juvenile literature” brought up the question whether books for 
children should be placed in a separate room, or among the other books according to 
their contents, only marked conspicuously with a “J” (juvenile books) on the back 
and in tho catalogue. In connection with this the other question was discussed, 
whether the library should assume control of the reading of minors, and restrict 
them to the reading of juvenile books. A vote proved that in 12 of the libraries 
represented the juvenile literature was placed separately; in24it was not. Further 
discussion revealed the fact that the different librarians adhered to the mede each 
had adopted, convinced that his was preferable. 
A discussion of the subject ‘‘ Reference books” revealed the fact that most libra- 
rians are accustomed to put dummies in the place of such works if they are taken 
from the shelf to be used in the reading room. These dummies are wooden blocks 
in book form, on the back of which a note is made stating the present location of 
the book. The query whether the dummies are used in place of all books taken out, 
as is done in the British Museum, was negatived unanimously. 
“Pamphlets” was a subject that gave rise to a discussion of its definition, While 
about one-half of those present designated an unbound publication of less than 100 
pages as a pamphlet, the others called eyery unbound book a pamphlet. It seems 
that the question was not clearly defined, What shall be considered a pamphlet 
from a bibliographical and statistical point of view? And from the other consider- 
ation, What shall be bound and catalogued? In the Harvard University library 
pamphlets kept in cases are designated as such by cards stating: “a collection of 
pamphlets on this subject still uncatalogned; see case so and so.” A similar prac- 
tico is found in Columbia College, New York. 
The subject of cataloguing gave rise to the question whether the days of “subject 
catalogue” were not numbered; whether in future it would not be better to. give 
the readers printed bibliographies in which books to be found in the library are 
marked. .It was the general opinion that the patrons of a library were more 
desirous to know what could be had on a certain subject than what existed. “Ina 
public library nct one in a hundred readers intends to exhaust a subject; they want 
to read something on it.” The question as to whether the subject or the author 
catalogue should give the title most accurately with regard to bibliography, was 
decided in favor of the author catalogue after Lane’s convincing argument. The 
majority thought it not necessary to find out and completely state the given names 
of foreign authors, but if was considered advisable to supplement in the card cata- 
logue cach subject card by an information card containing biographical statements 
concerning the author, On this card the given names might be accurately stated. 
The topic ‘ Classification” was excellently treated in a paper by Horace Kephart, 
of St. Louis. Unfortunately, this paper was not discussed. He called attention to 
the fact that classification and notation, or system of division and system of signa- 
ture, are tio very different things; that one might have a very detailed classification, 
and yet very simple signatures. The criticism contained in this was directed against 
the two systems extensively used in America, Dewey’s decimal and Cutter’s expansive 
system. In these systems cach subdivision is expressed by a new element in the 
signature. The consequence is that the signatures become as complicated as the 
Americans formerly and erroneously attributed them to the university library of 
Halle. Moreover, the classification of books is enslaved by such notation, as Kep- 
hart properly termed it. 
Kephart’s contribution to the programme was one of the few papers which remained 
undiscussed for reasons unknown, The remainder of the programme was completed. 
: The report of the cooperation committee gave a history of its work. It was con- 
stituted in 1876, and has endeavored to inform the members of every improved 
              
      
   
-P-A-G-E-592

library method or practice, and to place improvements at their disposal. It had, 
among other things, discussed and examined the various kinds of bookbinding; had 
formulated tables of comparative library statistics; recommended uniform blanks 
and cards, the dimensions of which are divisible uniformly; and had finally estab- 
lished a supply department, in order to haye everything belonging to a library 
equipment manufactured and furnished. In course of time this department has 
become an independent sirm, the Library Bureau, in Boston, with branch offices in 
Chicago and New York. This bureau still stands under the influence of the associa- 
tion. An illustrated catalogue of 176 pages, 8°, shows the extent of its business, 
which, from a paper pad to the writing desk, embraces everything a library needs. 
The committee also pays special attention to cooperative catalogue work. This 
work has assumed such importance that in 1886 a special section, the publishing 
section, was established. It caused anew edition of Poole’s Index to Periodicals up 
to 1881 to be published, and supplemented it up to 1891. The whole work contains 
now about 300,000 references in about 2,400 pages of two columnseach. The section 
has also made a subject index, called the A. L. A. Index, for collected essays, mono- 
graphs, and books of miscellaneous character. Both works are continued together 
under the name of Annual Literary Index. Furthermore, it has published a list of 
the best juvenile literature and accompanied it by notes. This work was prepared 
by J. 8. Sargent. By cooperation with a large number of professional librarians, 
the A. L. A. catalogue has been prepared by Miss Mary 8. Cutler. This is a list of 
books contained in a model library of 5,000 works selected from all branches of 
literature. This catalogue contains the titles in systematic order, according to 
Dewey’s and Cutler's systems, and with both signatures. It contains an author’s as 
well as a subject catalogue. This work has been printed and distributed by the 
Federal Government in thousands of copies. 
The public document committee reported its work, and Mr. Dewey read three 
letters of Senator Allen, who fathers a bill in Congress which provides “that all 
Government publications shall be regularly sent to all the libraries designated by 
the Government, and that the latter shall cause a subject index to be made of 
all previous publications, with annual supplements.” A resolution, in which the 
A. L. A. petitioned Congress to pass the bill, was adopted. 
A new proposition made by the committee on cooperation to the association had 
reference to foreign governmental publications. It was found desirable that a num- 
ber of libraries should try to obtain the official publications of Germany, France, and 
other European States. It was presupposed that the European libraries were also 
desirous to obtain American literature of that character. It was taken for granted 
that the Federal Government could arrange for an international exchange, for which 
a suitable organ existed in the Smithsonian Institution. The commission was 
authorized to pursue the matter further. 
Another committee had had the duty to inspect the library school of the State of 
New York, in Albany, conducted by Melvil Dewey. ‘Tho members of this committee 
reported upon the work of the school, which, during the last year, had consisted 
chiefly in the preparation and cataloguing of the A.L. A. library exhibit. The com- 
mittee mentioned a branch of study of specially practical value, which branch had 
recently been introduced, to wit: Instruction in composing and reading proof of 
catalogues and other printed matter. The committeo expressed high appreciation 
of the work of the school. : 
Another report was read by the committee on index to subject headings. In order 
to decrease the work of each cataloguer, a model index of all possible catchwords, 
indicating the best catchwords to be used as subheadings, and specially for sub- 
jects, the literature of which is very extensive, was submitted. A sample list was 
recommended for the literature of any country, containing 25 subheads: Antiquities, 
army, bibliography, biography, etc. Mr. Lane thought it impossible to furnish a 
complete list of all existing subheads. The subheads in the subject catalogue of
-P-A-G-E-593
  GERMAN CRITICISM OF AMERICAN EDUCATION. 583 
the model library of 5,000. volumes was only a drop in the bucket, and Mr. Brett 
thought a beginner in this kind of work might make use of the subheads in the 
catalogue of the Boston Atheneum. It was resolved, however, to continue the work 
of the committee. 
Simultaneous with the meeting of the A. L. A., certain sections held meetings; 
thus, the State Library Association, consisting of the officers of State libraries, and 
the College Library Section, consisting of the librarians of colleges and universi- 
ties. In this latter section Lane reported that the exchange of Harvard University 
with other libraries had increased to such an extent that special blanks had to be 
printed. The writer of this report attended this meeting, and since the question 
under discussion was, ‘‘How to accustom the student to use the library success- 
fully,” the question was asked how that was done in Germany, and whether it was 
true that books ordered could be had only after the expiration of several hours? 
When the fact was confirmed it was, and remained, the subject of undisguised 
astonishment. 
The sessions took place in the forenoons between 9 and 1; the afternoons were used 
to see objects of interest mentioned on the programme. On one day the library of 
the Armour Institute was visited. This institute is a technical school founded by 
Mr. Armour. The librarian, Miss Catherine L. Sharp, had made arrangements for 
a library training class, Another day the Woman’s Library was visited, which con- 
tains a great collection of works written or translated by women. This library was 
found in the Woman’s Palace, Another day the German book publishing trade 
exhibit was visited. This exhibit was found in the German Building in Jackson 
Park. Another day was consumed in inspecting the French and the German uniyer- 
sity library exhibits. 
For the latter exhibit a special invitation had been sent out. If one considers 
what powerful attractions the treasures of the World’s Exposition exerted upon peo- 
ple who had spent a year in professional work in libraries, it must be esteemed of 
great.importance that so large a number of librarians gathered together in the room 
in which the German libraries exhibited their organization and management. Here 
were seen and examined with interest the bibliographical publications, annual book 
lists, title indexes, lists of periodicals, different kinds and forms of catalogues, 
blanks and methods for using them, and the librarians seemed to be impressed with 
the fact that in Germany the technique or the practical side of library work was 
highly appreciated. 
How much America values the scientific side of the work is seen from the fact that 
the systematic catalogue of the University Library of Halle has been imitated in 
newly arranging the large American libraries of Yale College and the Sutro Library 
of San Francisco. 
The proceedings of the conference wero closed on the 22d of July with an earnest 
address by the outgoing president, Mr. Dewey, who urged upon the members to work 
for the noble cause, and to devote themselves to their profession with their whole 
soul, saying: “Iam proud that in the midst of the greatest collection of exhibits 
the world has ever seen we have proved our vital interest in the work of our lives 
by so splendid a series of meetings as wo have held.” 
InGermany also the plan of an organization of librarians, with regular conferences, 
has been considered, but objections of various kinds have prevented the execution 
of that plan. Whether now, after our profession has assumed a more independent 
aspect, the time has come to mature the plan, may be decided by others; at any rate, 
he who has followed the work of the American colleagues since the foundation of 
the A. L. A., and has witnessed the interesting labors of this year’s conference, as 
well as its exhibition, can not but express the desire that the Centralblatt fiir 
Bibliothekswesen may not close its first decade before it has published a report of 
proceedings of a G. L. A. (German Librarian Association).

          Tho following accounts of the Exposition are from the pen of M. Jules Steeg, 
director of the Musée Pédagogique (Paris), who was commissioned by the French 
minister of public instruction to superintend the installation of the French eduea- 
tional exhibit. The matter was comprised in two articles, published originally in 
the Revue Pédagogique. The first appeared before the Exposition was opened, i. e., 
June, 1893; the second, in the following July. 
The Exposition only occupics a point in this vast city, and yet it is of gigantic 
dimensions. There was full cloth to cut from, and it was cut freely. Tho plan called 
for large and numerous buildings separated by great spaces. Except the proportions, 
which really are immense, it isa copy of our exposition of 1889. Our hall of machinery 
(but here the inner iron braces are clumsy and disgraceful) was the model for the 
central palace, which is called the Manufactures and Liberal Arts Building. This 
is, to speak properly, the Exposition itself. Here it is that all industries are rep- 
resented. The four sections of the center are occupied by Germany, England, the 
United States, and France. Germany has made great effort, and the division is very 
attractive, but the interior does not corréspond to the external promises. Franee, 
on the contrary, has sent an abundanco of its choice products, stuffs, silks, furni- 
tures, bronzes, and so on, which will maintain its ancient fame. The palace of the 
fine arts, where we occupy, without doubt, the first place, is a beautiful construe- 
tion. The buildings for electricity, mines, agriculture, horticulture, fisheries, and 
some others, all immense, form a remarkable whole, in which the coarse details are 
lost. If by chance the sun shines from a blue sky, which is reflected in the lakes 
where Venetian gondolas and electric barks are running, and illuminates these pal- 
aces and domes, these cathedrals, theso glass and gilded roofs, this verdure just 
showing itself at the tip of the branches, the effect is really grand, and ‘‘the World’s 
Fair,” as it is called by the Americans, merits perhaps better, another name which 
they bestow upon it sometimes, and which I prefer, ‘the White City.” 
But as to the educational exposition? If I have not said anything aboutit,itis “ 
because it is not yet finished. In fact, the greater part of installations are still in a 
disordered state. When this article appears in the ‘‘ Reyue ” the Exposition will be 
at its height; at present, the latter part of May, it is in the hands of the plasterers, 
carpenters, upholsterers, glaziers, unpackers. The glass cases of the exposition of 
the department of public instruction are not yet ready. * * * The American 
section occupies considerable space, a whole wing of the first story of the hall of 
manufactories. Every State, every Territory, without counting particular institu- 
tions, has reserved to itself a series of alcoves. It is necessary to make a veritable 
journey in order to examine somewhat particularly this abundance, this mass of 
documents which are here accumulated, As far as I have been able to discern in 
looking over that which is mmpacked and put in place there will be a certain resem- 
blance and repetition in this profusion of materials. The schools of the most widely 
separated States resemble one another like sisters; the methods (if there are any),

the distribution of studies, the results, the copy books, exercises, subjects, all seem 
to have been cast in the samo mold. An attractive feature will be the photographs; 
everything is photographed, the buildings, scholars, exercises of all sorts, classes in 
reading, writing, drawing, recitation, physical and chemical experiments, libraries 
and halls for gymnastics; every State, every school has its photographs in great 
plates, which adorn the walls of the aleoves—without counting pictures in swinging 
frames and innumerable albums on the desks and the tables. In time the examina- 
tion becomes tiresome, and it is only instructive as showing the great similarity of 
all the schools, all the classes, and all the exercises. 
The only State whose exposition is now ready is one of the New England States, 
Massachusetts. The superintendent of the schools of Malden, Mr. Gay, principal of a 
high school, has been charged by his State government to organize this exposition, 
and he has kindly done the honors of it for me. I looked with interest through the 
exercise books of the scholars from the first school year until the ninth. These have 
been made with reference to the Exposition, but according to the customary habits 
and methods. There is a school in which all exercises are written with lead pencil, 
at least for several years, and they have been written in the same way for Chicago. 
Tt does not scem to me that the Massachusetts scholars do better work than ours at 
the same age; they write more legibly in very big characters and retain this habit 
until the end; they do less dictation, and they seem to me less advanced in arith- 
metic. For some years particular care has been given to drawing, which was for- 
merly neglected or even unknown. It became by degrees optional and at last obliga- 
tory. Three orders of exercises are followed which aim at a special end—exercises 
with straight lines, which tend to mechanical and industrial drawing; exercises 
with curved lines, which prepare for ornamentation, and exercises in copying and 
coloring, which lead to artistic drawing and painting. The series of these three 
exercises seemed to me very interesting and worthy of examination. 
Three years in the primary class grade, four or five in the grammar, lead to the 
high school, which is apparently better known and more largely attended than in 
our country. 
What surprised me most at first was the great number of women teachers. All 
the photographs give evidence of this also; I haye not scen a single master, only 
women teachers. There are, however, some masters, Of 363,935 persons teaching 
in the United States, 125,602 are men and 238,333 women. The men as arule only 
enter upon the work with the view of leaving it assoon as they find a position which 
is more lucrative; the womenremain until they marry. The greatest number of the 
scholars of the normal schools are young ladies; some young men are also following 
the courses, but more usually they simply have an academic training. 
The position occupied by women in public lifeis considerable and surprises a Euro- 
pean. There is for instance in New York a medical college for women, and nothing 
is more curious than to see these ladies assembled in a lecture hall wearing black 
dresses with the doctors’ square hat on their heads. 
At this moment there is a women’s congress here. It is the one, I believe, which 
opens the series of the great congresses of the Exposition. It has already been in 
session two days, and proceeds with the perfect regularity of a parliament. Fifteen 
hundred Jadies, regularly delegated by the women of their States or by some associ- 
ation, besides delegates of foreign nations, are united in general congregation and 
in sections, with presidents, vice-presidents, secretaries, and orators. I am told that 
very interesting reports have been read, eloquent discourses delivered. All subjects 
are treated: The moral influence of women, education, the school, religion, fashions, 
dress, political rights, the progress accomplished by women in the sciences, physics, 
medicine, law, ete. One State, Wyoming, has already granted to women electoral 
and political rights, and Kansas is moving to this end. 
In America the girls and boys are educated together. They sit on the same benches, 
pursue the same lessons and the same exercises without any distinction whatever;

for the boys even take part in the sewing exercises, and are very proud to exhibit 
their needlework every year beside that of their female companions. They would 
be astonished, I was told, if anyone seemed surprised at this. I refer here to the 
first school years. Later some separation takes place in spite of all the theories in 
the world. 
The manual training and the maternal (infant) schools—which are called here by 
the German name kindergarten—as well as regular instruction in drawing, are inno- 
vations in American pedagogics. In 1880 there were in the United States 232 kinder- 
gartens, with 524 teachers and 8,871 pupils. Ten years afterwards there were 521, 
with 1,202 teachers and 31,221 pupils. The Americans seem to me to be much 
interested in this institution, as if it were one of the things which they have dis- 
covered and of which they are very proud. This movement will grow, at least in 
the populous cities where these little schools can render great service. 
As is well known there is not in America a department of public instruction, nor a 
central authority of any kind that controls the schools. They are solely the charge 
of local districts (communes), subject only to the laws of the particular State which 
regulates the tax for the support of the schools and maintains a certain supervision or 
inspection over them. The only central institution which takes cognizance of pub- 
lic instruction is the Bureau of Education located at Washington, and under the 
Department of the Interior. This Bureau comprises four divisions, which employ 
altogether 42 persons. The first division is that of correspondence, the second that of 
American statistics, the third of international statistics; the fourth constitutes a 
pedagogic library, analogous to that of our museum, but of less importance. 
A fifth division is occupied in establishing schools in Alaska. Churches of every 
denomination had already opened some schools near their missions; several had even 
established boarding schools, very necessary in these regions, which are so vast and 
uninhabitable during winter. 
This year the Bureau maintains in Alaska 15 public schools, with 20 teachers and 
872 pupils, and it aids 14 denominational schools, which receive 1,069 scholars. 
This is still too little, as it is estimated that there are 8,000 children of school age. 
Under this polar ice civilization advances. I have seen a paper of Alaska, the Star 
of the North; I have seen the photographs of the school of the little Eskimos; I have 
read, with very heartfelt and sincere interest, their school exercises, their written 
pages, which are very neat and correct, their problems, narrations, little naive let- 
ters written by the small boys and girls of Karluk, Unga, Ufognac, Kadiak, Hoonak, 
Kilisnoo, Hydac, Anvit, etc. Look out on the map these forlorn points, where 
we have brothers, where little children walk joyfully to school, where women of 
heart devote themselves to the sweet and difficult task of educating them well. 
Little Petruska, of Anvik, writes the 9th of January: ‘Yesterday it was cold; to-day 
it is not cold; sometimes it gets very cold, and men die. In summer sometimes 
men sleep in canoes.” All thoughts of this little one turn on the thermometer. 
The Americans, people of business and money, are at the same time fond of 
schools, some from custom and impulse, others from humanity; the wise from 
patriotism and forethought. From the icy regions of Alaska to the luxuriance of 
Florida the school takes a place of honor in the regard of the citizens. The innu- 
merable halls which they have given to their school exposition among the buildings 
of the World’s Fair are a proof of that. Perhaps we shall have some interesting 
things to show to them; at any rate, we shall have many things to see and to gather 
from them which will be of interest in the education of future generations. 
[SECOND ARTICLE.] 
The exposition of the department of public instruction and of the schools under 
other departments was officially opened the 10th of June. Invitations had been 
addressed to the delegates of the foreign Governments and of the American States, to 
the school authorities, to the teachers of the city, and to the press. Very many came,,

especially ladies. W6 offered, according to the custom here, champagne, cakes, and 
flowers at the samo time that we did the honors of our collections, of our written 
exercises, and of our books. 
The school exposition of France, which seemed at the beginning destined to be 
crowded within the most limited space, succeeded in securing considerable exten- 
sion, and it is certainly one of the most important, the richest in documents, and 
the most substantial. It seems to produce an excellent impression upon the numer- 
ous visitors who pass through. They say so, at least, in running over our albums 
and in asking us with much curiosity about our organization, which is so different 
from theirs. 
At the entrance of our alcove is a large and well lighted vestibule, which at the last 
moment was kindly granted to us by the American administration. Itis ornamented 
with plaster modcls for the use of our normal schools and our lyeées. On the first 
panel are shown drawings of the scholars of the normal schools and very beautiful 
photographs of the schools of Lille and Roubais; in the center a maternal school, 
upon the blackboard of which the teacher has written in big letters: ‘The little 
Lillois salute their friends in Chicago.” The two pillars at the entrance are deco- 
rated with geographical maps; upon our eight panels (there were only two in the 
beginning) are specimens of manual work (wood, iron, modeling), specirens of our 
pictorial charts, mural maps, pictures used in object teaching, in natural history, 
ete., musical notation, drawings, statistics, and even stenography. <A beautiful panel 
of water colors from the school in Ganneron street occupies a large space between 
two windows. In the high show cases of our principal hall are displayed: First, the 
publications of learned societies, books belonging to public libraries, scientific pub- 
lications.- Second, the doctors’ theses of the different faculties and the documents of 
superior instruction. Third, the books, methods, programmes, tabular views of sec- 
ondary instruction, the best compositions offered last year at the competitive exer- 
cises of the lycées for girls, the compositions of last year for the several examina- 
tions (baccalaureates, licenses, certificates of aptitude, “agrégations”). This is the 
part that most surprises observing visitors, because it does not correspond to any- 
ting in their own collections, Our secondary instruction isan organization unknown 
in America. Fourth, the publications of the pedagogical museum, monographs and 
documents, principal pedagogical works published in France from Fenelon and Rous- 
scau to MM. Compayré, Marion, Pécaut and others, the ‘Revue Pédagogique,” ete. 
Fifth, the principal books used in our superior primary schools collected from all 
classical libraries of Paris. Sixth, specimens of the works which constitute the most 
of. our school libraries (this institution seems much appreciated). Seventh, our 
chools for boys, exercise books, drawings, photographs. Eighth, the same from our 
schools for girls. Ninth, the same from our superior primary schools. Tenth, our 
normal schools, programmes, works of scholars, exercise books, compositions, draw- 
ings, photographs. Eleventh, works of teachers, books, lectures, reports of inspec- 
tion, methods of teaching, agriculture, music, gymnastics. Twelfth, specimens of 
apparatus used in our superior primary and normal schools for instruction in sciences, 
physics, chemistry, natural history, including an clectric machine, a pneumatic 
machine, and even a steam engine for demonstrations; finally the school materials 
for writing and drawing, models of school furniture, etc. 
A fine, large, low glass case we had the good fortune to obtain from the Woman’s 
Building. This we have placed in full view along the lake side. It is 11 meters 
long, and enables us to exhibit the whole series of our manual works, beginning 
with the cut paper and the little knitting of our maternal schools up to the sewing, 
embroideries, garments, lacework, and flowers from the great schools of Lyons, 
Bordeaux, Le Puy, Nice, Toulon, etc., and also a certain number of works by boys, 
which could not be placed upon the panels—carpentry specimens, ironworks, model- 
ing, and geometric figures. 
Three long tables, placed in the midst of our hall, and a desk, adjoining the glass 
cases, are loaded with albums and with cartoons of drawings, sewing, photographs,

school plans, ete. I was ashamed at first of our poverty; to-day I am overwhelmed 
by our abundance. In proportion as the boxes were unpacked and the objects were 
put one after the other in their places, I was struck with the richness, variety, orig- 
inality, and interest of our exhibit. I did not find anything equal to it in the other 
exhibits. 
Four adjoining halls contain the expositions of the Central School, the School of 
Mines, tho schools of arts and trades at Aix and Chalons, with enormous cases of 
work in iron, complicated machines, which people stop tocxamine; schools for watch- 
making in Besancon anc Cluses, where the works are always in action, attract the eye; 
commercial schools of Paris and of Bordeaux, which are highly appreciated by the 
commercial classes; the Society of Franklin, the polytechnical and philotechnical 
associations. The works of the pupils of these institutions—the methods, flowers, 
drawings, and porcelains—form a charming panel. The maps of the topographical 
service of the ministry of war—central France, the Alps and Pyrenees, Tunis, and 
others, in black, in colors, in relief, really fine—are admired by connoisseurs, and a 
German professor confessed to me the other day that he never had scen anything so 
perfect. This entire collection is proof of great effort and of indisputable progress. 
Our exhibit is evidence that we have not wasted our time, and if there remains 
much to be done in the field of instruction, we have the satisfactory conviction that 
much has been eecomplished already. 
The French exposition in general isa great success. The ground floor is devoted 
to our industries. The good taste of the show cases, the magnificence of the toilets 
displayed, the silk dresses of all colors and styles, lavish embroideries, magnificent 
furniture, rich stuffs, furs, porcelains, artistic bronzes, excite admiration. Every 
minute one hears the women exclaim: ‘‘I have never seen such a thing in my life!” 
It is true that this is an expression very commen here. 
Cur school exhibit can not pretend to such popularity and does not provoke these 
comments of the passers by. It is severe; its principal treasures are of modest 
appearance; the mine must be dug to discover the nuggets. But when a man ora 
woman, engaged in school work, lingers there, hears the explanations, examines for 
himself the series of our exercises, he becomes deeply interested. The school mono- 
graph of a French youth, his monthly exercise books, his compositions, his drawings, 
his certificates of studies, his books, the monograph of a pupil of the normal school, 
the monograph of a school in its different courses, the rolled copy beoks, the pro- 
grammes, the time-table, form a whole very clear and thoroughly honest. A brief 
visit is really sufficient for a sort of general inspection; for we put before the eyes 
the actual reports of inspectors of primary schools, of academic inspectors, and of 
principals of schools. Nothing is concealed; nothing is gotten up for the occasion. 
The real life of our schools develops itself before the eyes. 
Manual work begins to engage attention in this country; it has been organized in 
eertain schools; bere and there special schools for the same have been established 
preparatory to apprenticeship or to technical schools. ‘The specimens which we 
have brought excite great interest. They do not differ much from tho work exe- 
euted in the American gchools; we have perhaps more method, more connection in 
the series of works. I speak of the boys’ work, which proceeds here too often by 
fits and starts. Our needlework seems generally superior to that of the American 
schools; it is true that we have brought the upper part of the casket, and that here 
little time is devoted to this kind of work. 
Tho American exposition of schools is very large and much scattered; under the 
circumstances it is very monotonous, as all of the forty-four States of the Union 
exhibit their schools and their universities, and several of them, the most impor- 
tant, upon a large scale. Immense spaces are covered by the exhibits of the uni- 
versities or colleges, These include apparatus of physical laboratories, collections. 
of mineralogy, botany, and zoology. These collections consist generally of large 
objects, which appear more appropriate for popular than for scientific instrue- 
   
-P-A-G-E-600
  590 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
tion; for example, parts of the human skeleton, which resemble the remains of mam- 
moths, a colossal skull, gigantic tibias, The same is the case with the botanical 
specimens. This part of the exposition appears to me childish, and does not show a 
high degree of knowledge on tho part of the young men for whom it is intended. 
With the exception of some universities which are well known, higher education is 
indeed weak enough. Fow here have time to devote themselves to deep studies, to 
lengthy and uninteresting works which science necessarily imposes; everyone is in 
haste for results, for practice, for immediate application. 
Primary instruction is divided here into several categories. The primary school 
properly called, extends from the sixth to the tenth year of ege, the grammar school 
from the tenth to the fourteenth, the secondary school from the fourteenth to the 
eighteenth year. There are many intelligent and industrious children who pass 
more rapidly through the different degrees. The exhibits of these schools consist of 
written exercises and drawings. The former do not include a series of books by the 
same pupils. The use of the exercise book is indeed almost unknown. For every 
exercise white sheets of paper are distributed, and on this the scholar inscribes his 
name and writes rapidly the given work. These sheets united and bound according 
to classes constitute the universal and invariable basis of the American school 
exposition. They correspond to our monthly exercise books in that they give the 
physiognomy of a class but for one day only and for a single subject. These exer- . 
cises are generally very short and consist of a few lines, written large and rapidly. 
They do not show effort, struggle for improvement, hard work; no spot nor erasure, 
this is avoided. I looked over only a few, those of the younger pupils and those of 
the most advanced. I did not discover in them what I expected, what I thought to 
be tho distinctive mark of this country, even though it might be faulty. For the 
most part what meets the eye is uniformity. : 
Tunderstand very well the reason for this. I have visited a good number of public 
schools in this immense agglomeration called Chicago, which increases immeasurably 
from year to year by an incessant tide of immigration. Half of the population are 
Germans; there are 70,000 Scandinavians, many Italians, Russians, Canadians, etc. 
Their children who come to school do not understand English, they are foreigners. 
It is necessary to transform them during the school years and make good Americans 
of them. This has been accomplished with surprising success. After a few years 
spent in this crucible they are cast, formed, coming out of the same mold they bear 
the samo stamp, haye tho same language, the same handwriting, the samo habit of 
mind, have read the same books, sung the same songs, made the same movements; 
what one sees, the other sees also; girls, boys, they are “American citizens;” this is 
the word which is used and which is repeated to them every minute, and of which 
they are taught rightly cnough to be proud. If this uniformity is necessary, if it is 
a necessity of the public welfare in a State like this, which is in constant process of 
formation, it is so in all new or developing States, and in a greater or less degree this 
is the condition of every State in the Union. 
One of the most significant exercises in this respect which I have witnessed in the 
schools of Chicago, but which must be generally practiced, if I may judge from the 
photographs of different States, is the salute to the flag. Every pupil has two little 
flags, tricolored with white stars upon blue ground; at a signal of the mistress all 
rise and imitate her movements. They carry the two flags to their hearts, above 
their heads, around their necks; they make many graceful movements with them, 
extending them forward, backward, upward and downward, with a rhythmical, 
monotonous song. It is indeed strange to see these great boys and girls going 
gravely through this exercise, in which every movement is identified with the 
national banner. The ceremony is finished by a patriotic song. 
It is rather difficult to comprehend the whole school exposition, because outside 
of the halls of the Manufactures Building every State has its individual building, 
in which the exhibition of its special products and of its schools is found. There 
 
-P-A-G-E-601
  FRENCH VIEWS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION. 591 
are expositions of schools in the Women’s Building and in the Children’s Building. 
This latter is very unique. It comprises all kinds of toys, from rattles to the most 
complicated playthings, Christmas trees, pictures, etc.; a library, very incomplete, 
however; works on infant pedagogics in different languages; a great hall for gym- 
nastics with equipments, a part of which has been recently rejected in France, 
ring, trapezes, fixed bars, horses, ladders, ropes, ete. Every day a class comes there 
to exercise under the direction of a teacher for the entertainment of the public. 
There is also a model nursery with all furniture, beds, cradles, the most perfect per- 
ambulators; children are brought here and aro taken in charge for 25 cents a day, in 
order to show to spectators the working of the institution. You find here a model 
asylum, in which a dozen babies, all clean and nice, can be seen through the windows, 
where the public crowds to watch them playing, singing, moving around, listening 
to the tales of the mistress. Here are piano, playthings, the whole Froebelianum; 
nothing is wanting. There is also a class for cooking to be seen through the windows; 
and through other windows a class for sloyd or working in wood and modeling in clay. 
This I was permitted to visit. Here three days in a week one class of boys and girls, 
and the other days another class work under the direction of a teacher and under 
tho eyes of the public; in the forenoon they work in wood, in the afternoon in clay. 
All this is very interesting, but a little too much advertised and placarded for our 
ideas. 
Ihave been more interested in looking at the actual school life than at its exhibi- 
tions. Iwas present at the class exercises, especially those of anormal school. The 
Cook County School in the south of Chicago consists of a large public school with 
400 pupils, divided into eight grades and in sixteen classes, with which is combined 
a normal school—for this, I believe, is the way to regard it. One hundred and fifty 
student-teachers, of whom 20 are young men (the others are young women), follow 
the courses, which are not intended to teach them sciences, but to show them how 
to apply the instruction to schools. The course is one or two years. Each day from 
half past 1 until half past 2 is devoted to practical exercises. This is the only time 
that the two schools come together, although all the courses take place in different 
stories in the same building. The primary school is then divided into groups of 10 
pupils, and over each is placed a normal student; the other students of the normal 
school seat themselves at the tables of the children, become pupils, take part in the 
exercises, raise their hands when the teacher asks a question, and sometimes answer. 
When the hour is over, things resume their ordinary course. The normal students 
who have assisted at the lesson make their notes, which they deliver to the director. 
If he finds the observations just, he makes use of them in the criticism of the lesson, 
which is made privately to the student who conducted it. There isno public criticism. 
Colonel Parker (of the family of the celebrated Theodore Parker, of Boston), 
principal of the establishment, is a distinguished original character, who has made 
his own school a model school; he tries with laudable zeal, and not without suc- 
cess, to develop in the children spontaneity and the passion for investigation and 
observation. Irom the first school year he gives great prominence to @rawing from 
nature, or rather to painting; he puts into the hands of the little ones pencils, 
colors, a glass of water, places them in front of a tree, a flower, and leaves them to 
make an effort. I have seen among these water colors some very charming “‘impres- 
sions.” He gives great attention to physical geography, the study of the surface of 
the earth, and of relief forms. He has exercises in this subject which are really 
curious and instructive. 
Whatever the Americans may say against our system of emulation, they do not 
entirely disregard it. I have assisted in a distribution of prizes. It was the closing 
exercises of the graduating class of a superior primary (high school). It is called 
here a ‘‘commencement,” but in most cases it is the end of school life, and at the 
the samo time, as they say here, the beginning of the school of life. We were in a 
church, which had been offered for this purpose, the school of Hyde Park, as an 
    
   
-P-A-G-E-602
      592 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
exceptional case, not having an assembly hall, The church was decorated with 
flowers. Ninety young men, of whom 20 were boys in jackets, all with flowers in 
their buttonholes, the rest young women, in very fine white dresses, defiled slowly 
before our eyes to the sound of the organ, and took their seats on the stage. The 
president of the young University of Chicago (it has existed only one year) read a 
discourse on the necessity of earnestness for American citizens who are entering into 
life. He explained that he meant by this ‘‘sincerity, courage, energy, persever- 
ance.” The director made an impressive address to his pupils who were about to 
leave him, and he bestowed upon some of them medals of gold or silver, given by 
rich persons (among them the chief editor of a paper), rewards for the best essays 
upon civic instruction. Two young women and one young man were especially 
praised. For the young man the director predicted the highest destiny, even in 
the distant future the chair of the President of the Republic. Then two of the 
pupils addressed us; one, a graceful young lady, had chosen for her subject, ‘“‘ The 
men of genius.” She explained what she understood by genius, what it is, what it 
is not, how it is favored by circumstances, but not created by the same. Then she 
finished with an eloquent valedictory to her school. The other, a boy of 17 years, 
entertained us with a dissertation on ‘“ Originality,” of what it consists, its relations 
to ‘‘precedents,” what it takes from them of better or of worse. We are told over 
and over about what our fathers have done; this is good, provided we do not con- 
fine ourselves to it; in truth there was only one man of absolute originality, i. e., 
Adam; as to us, we must be what our nature demands. This young man finished 
his speech also with a valedictory to the school. ‘‘Our promotion,” he said, ‘is 
really original, and instead of mourning over our departure let us rejoice like 
mariners whose sails are swollen by the wind, to travel boldly over the vast oceans.” 
This young man had an easy delivery and a pleasing accent; his gestures were 
graceful, and he wasa great success. A teacher presented him alyre of roses. He was 
besides the poet of the occasion; before the close the class sang a song composed by 
him (prosaic enough). In addition there was instrumental and choral music; then 
the solemn and silent distribution of the diplomas. These young men and women 
go from here, some to colleges, others to universities, others into offices and business. 
All this is not a part of the exposition, but it is a living commentary upon it. It 
is, indeed, by its uctual operations that school life is to be understood. On the 
oceasion of these departures, or “‘commencements,” the pupils of the different schools 
compose discourses, dissertations npon subjects which they have chosen. Here are 
some of the subjects selected in these days: ‘‘The necessity of political education in 
the United States.” ‘‘Itis necessary to oppose immigration.” ‘There should be 
no obstacles to immigration.” ‘‘The regimen of the superior schools.” ‘The ques- 
tion of slavery.” ‘Influence of nature.” “What can I learn from the Exposition 
of Chicago?” ‘‘Heroism.” ‘Moral character of Jay Gould.” ‘The workers and 
the drones.” ‘Physical courage and moral courage.” 
There is in all this much show and emptiness, but there is also boldness and -reflec- 
tion; briefly, a mixture of good and bad, as in all human things. 
We see here customs, necessities, intellectual and social habits which are different 
from ours. Woe must not judge them by our standard. Neither woul it be well for 
us to admire and to imitate them freely. Whatis best for them would not be best 
for us. Each of us has his own course, and should hold to it. We may modify our 
methods, we may take from others what serves our purposes, develop and expand it, 
but we should guard ourselves from the notion that blind imitation of others is a:' 
essential condition of progress.

The vigorous and constant effort of Americans to raise the level of their superior 
instruction testifies to the importance of the scientific movement in the United States. 
Indeed, here public education is provided for as one of the first necessities of a free 
country. The States, cities, and rural districts impose heavy taxes on themselves in 
order that every citizen may acquire elementary instruction. More than 200,000 
elementary schools are scattered over the country, and the annual expense for these 
reaches 700,000,000 francs. 
But the original trait of the American democracy is its judicious predisposition 
toward the aristocracy of knowledge. This nation, justly renowned for its positive 
spirit, understands very well that superior instruction alone promotes the progress 
of ideas, the improvement of methods, and even the development of practical matters. 
The higher instruction is almost always the work of private individuals who have 
founded it and who maintain it, constantly adding to its resources. Its total receipts 
and expenditure, as given in the latest official documents, exceeded $16,500,000 (about 
84,000,000 francs). These millions have come voluntarily from the farm, from the 
-gunter, or the manufactory, and the generous initiative of the givers does not 
leolines: <*>. * 
The circle of the higher studies has been particularly enlarged, especially in recent 
times, and American universities have been multiplied in emulation one of another. 
Of course, it is necessary to make distinction among the number. Some, especially 
of the newer ones, promise, perhaps, more than they accomplish in spite of their title 
of university, in spite of their official endowments and patronage. Europe has not 
the monopoly of grand programmes on paper. Others, on the contrary, bearing the 
modest name of college and having complete independence, are universities of the 
first rank. Naturally the degrees differ in their value according to the different 
quality of the teaching bodies who grant them. We even hear that in certain 
establishments of so-called superior instruction the diplomas are acquired by means 
unknown to science and are conferred “honoris causa.” These are abuses insepa- 
rable from liberty. The graduates of America, whose interest it is to avoid all 
ambiguity, mention simply the source of their degrees. 
This spontaneous organization of superior education in the United States may be 
wanting in uniformity; nothing harmonious nor symmetrical; the effort has been to 
do much and do it quickly. But what powerful vitality in the tumultuous outburst 
of grand intentions! What constant progress in scientific studies, even in recent 
foundations! What generous ardor for competition with rivals in the Eastern States, 
which possess the advantage of experience and the prestige of previous service! 
The very absence of fixed method and established order in these efforts may make 
success so much the greater. Tho young universities of America find only encour- 
agement in the history of their predecessors, which were poor at the beginning 
and to-day are flourishing. 
The oldest of all and justly the most celebrated, Harvard College, was originally 
a little school founded in 1636 by the Puritans of Massachusetts, and two years after- 
wards, organized by the aid and pecuniary contribution of John Harvard, a noncon- 
formist minister, who had come from Cambridge, where he had taken his degrees at 
Emanuel College. However, the name of the great English university was given te 
the humble cradle of the American college. This title marked a noble ambition, 
which from that time the zeal of the professors and students endeavored to justify. 
The whole colony celebrated as a holiday the solemn day of the month of August, 
1642, when the first nine students of Harvard received the degree of “bachelor pre 
more academiarum in Anglia.” The work went on slowly at first. Its financial 
situation was far from satisfying the wishes of its founders, for the local legislature,

in spite of the Puritan convictions by which it was animated, several times author- 
ized the administrators to procure money by lotteries; that of 1806 produced $25,000 
(125,000 frances). The era of prosperity began about the second decade of the nine- 
teenth century. But it is especially during the last twenty years that the progress 
has been rapid and the transformation perfected. The college, confined formerly 
within the somewhat narrow limits of denominational ideas, presents to-day the 
amplitude of the true modern university as regards its-teaching personnel, its 
equipment, and its complete departments. Two hundred teachers of every order 
there dispense the higher instruction to 2,000 students, whose earnest spirit, stim- 
ulated by a library of 350,000 volumes, may draw freely from the different sourees 
of human knowledge. All instruments for working, all perfect means for learning, 
laboratories, museums, observatories, botanical gardens, ete., here conduce to the 
intellectual initiative. The buildings impress the eye by their grand proportions. 
Two chapels, seven dormitories, five large dwelling houses, seven buildings, among 
them the beautiful edifice of granite which contains the library, arise on a quad- 
rangle, which covers almost 10 hectares (about 25 acres). Moreover, these different 
buildings oceupy only half of the whole domain belonging to the college. Further, 
to these must be added the numerous small buildings and important annexes which 
are situated in Cambridge or in Boston, and extend even into the adjoining districts. 
Thought goes back to the single building of former times established upon a small 
site covering less than 2 acres. The primitive seed has yielded fruit. 
At present the annual budget of the university reaches $1,000,000 (5,000,000 francs). 
Nevertheless these resources scarcely correspond to the need in spite of the prudent 
administration of the council and the skillful management of the treasurer, who 
secures from his funds more than 5 per cent, and the coffers would always be empty 
if the generosity of the “sens of Harvard” did not keep them full. What intense 
life in all departments of the university! Physical exercises are not neglected. 
Care is taken to measure and photograph the students at regular intervals in order 
to control, experimentally, the progressive results of a methodical training, specially 
intended to preserve beauty and just proportions of form. This is the classical ideal 
of an accomplished man, to be at once both beautiful and good, xaos 2 adyados 
the Greek type returns to America. Is there not even in New York a. school of 
beauty for ladies, where they learn to speak, to walk, and eyen to sleep with grace? 
Harvard University has become a nursery of learned men, who carry their knowl 
edge to the four corners of the Union. Its doctors of science, to speak only of thosc, 
have no jonger reason to envy their brothers in Great Britain or on the Continent. 
We will not say that they are identical. Without doubt with the prompt diffusion 
of ideas by means of papers and books, by congresses and the intercourse of every 
kind that the ever-increasing facility and rapidity of communication among think- 
ing men establishes, higher instruction must be everywhere the same in its essential 
lines. But upon this common soil each nation impresses its own mark, and none is 
more jealous to leave its own than the United States. The American brings the 
qualities of his race to bear upon scientific culture, the patient energy, quickness of 
eye, inventive imagination, practical sense, which knows how to draw from science 
application and profit. 
This practical sense is not only manifested by ingenious inventions destined to 
facilitate the life of all persons and to make the fortune of the individual inventor. 
It is shown also in the creation of certain university specialties which we are not 
accustomed to see among the faculties properly called thus, for instance, schools of 
dentistry and of agriculture. The last are of great service, especially in the districts 
where various crops.are cultivated. The University of California possesses a model 
of this kind. This establishment undertakes the analysis of soils, indicates to those 
interested the species of plants best suited. to different districts, and furnishes, gra- 
tuitously, the necessary seeds or grains. As to schools of dentistry they exist in 
nearly all American universities; Harvard itself has one. That of Philadelphia is 
   
-P-A-G-E-605
          FRENCH VIEWS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION. 595 
the most renowned on account of its practical method, the luxuriance of its install- 
ment, and the importance of its works. Twenty-two thousand patients are mentioned 
in its recent reports. The weight of gold employed reached 6 pounds. The instrue- 
tion, which is very complete, constitutes areal faculty comprehending no less than 
seven distinct chairs. Students come from Europe and the Indies to tako their 
degrees at Philadelphia. The Americans are the first dentists of the world. 
Can one speak of superior instruction in America without noting how eagerly the 
wonien strive to participate init? The movement does not diminish, but the con- 
trary. Every day sees an increase in the number of those who study mathematics, 
physics, law, medicine, Latin, or even Greek. The programmes of the studies and 
the examinations are, moreover, identical for both sexes in the very practical system 
of cceducation as well as in the special courses. The young female students bring 
to this high instruction, along with the ardent desire to learn, the determined resolu- 
tion to obtain social equality, of which scholarly equality is the prelude. But their 
native gracoremains. They add to it solid qualities and a fund of varied knowledge. 
Thus conversation with American women constitutes the charm of society in the 
United States. 
Alearned doctor of Boston points out some shadows in the picture. With statistics 
in his hands he pretends to prove that the number of births decreases in proportion 
as the level of female instruction rises. His patriotic fears even cause him to foresee 
the moment when the race will end in an “intellectual apotheosis.” Is this prog- 
nostic serious? If young America is already attacked by evils from which the older | 
peoples suffer, its robust constitution and its exceptional resources assure conditions 
of resistance much superior. | 
The Exposition of Chicago has shown with what vigor all branches of human 
activity are developed in the United States. Certainly science has not yet attained 
heights comparable with those on which at present the fortune of the capitalists is 
elevated; the dollar holds first place, but science advances with rapid steps. The 
scientific movement, of which we can only here give a summary idea, is not concen- 
trated in the old States of the East, which are like a transatlantic Europe, it extends 
over the youngest States. The Americans comprehend that high intellectual culture 
is not alone a question of elegant luxuriance or of national self-love; the prosperity 
and eyen the future of the country depends upon it. A mere glance at the different 
nations of the two worlds suffices to prove this. 
CHICAGO EXPOSITION—PRINTING AND THE BOOK TRADE. 
One of the most important reports called forth by the Chicago Exposition is that 
of the exhibits of publishers and booksellers, by M. Henri le Soudier. 
Two tasks were committed to M. le Soudier; first, to secure complete information 
as to tho state and future possibilities ‘of the trade in French books in the United 
States, with suggestions of such reforms as it might seem well to adopt; second, a 
comparative survey of the French book exhibits and those of other countries. Both 
subjects are fully treated and the work has scarcely less interest for the general 
reader than for the book trade. 
The report is introduced by general observations as to the plan of the Exposition, 
the buildings and grounds, with a glance at its commercial bearings. The author 
then proceeds to discuss the conditions offered by the United States for the sale of 
books. The reports of previous expositions have not, he says, attempted a study 
of this nature, which seems to him of greater importance than the comparative 
estimates of exhibits. In this study M. le Soudier dwells upon the libraries of the 
United States, their number, variety, ample resources, and the liberal spirit in which 
they are conducted. He notes, also, that women form a large proportion of readers, 
“the men,” he says, ‘too often lack the time for reading; they content themselves 
with newspapers. This explains the extraordinary circulation of certain political 
sheets, a circulation unknown in the old countries, and the number of pages in a
-P-A-G-E-606
           
     
596 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
single paper as, for instance, in the Chicago Tribune. The women on the contrary 
have more leisure. In contrast with the men, who generally quit school at the age 
of 15 or 16 years to devote themselves to business, entering-at once upon their 
apprenticeship, the young women prolong their studies much longer, often even 
until 20 years of age. After marriage they continue their education, pursuing some 
department of fine arts, or some special study. As the man, unless he is engaged in 
some one of the liberal professions, has had only a limited education, while that of 
the woman has been much more extended, her mind is more cultivated, thanks to 
herreading.” ‘‘Ispeak here,” he adds, ‘‘only of the business class, which forms about 
four-fifths of the population of the United States. This intellectual predominance 
of the women explains the large place given to literary works and romances in the 
public libraries, while in the univ ies classical and scientific works predominate.” 
The reporter considers then the relative demand for German and French books in 
the United States. ‘‘In this respect,” he says, “the first thing to be noticed, although 
it is painful to confess it, is the prominence given to German books in a large num- 
ber of important libraries, a proportion which rises even as high as 90 per cent in 
certain cities. Some libraries indeed, but these principally in the East, comprise a 
large number of French books, chiefly literary works; but after leaving the Atlantic 
States the farther West you go the more the German language dominates. It is the 
same with periodicals. Thus, in the public library of Chicago, are comprised 65 
German periodicals, more than 21 newspapers in the German language, published in 
the United States, chiefly at Chicago, while there are found only 21 French period- 
icals and 2 newspapers in the French language, published in the United States— 
the ‘Courrier de I’Dlinois,” published at Kankakee, and the ‘Courrier des Etats- 
Unis,” published at New York. 
This state of things is attributed very justly to the great German immigration 
and to the care which German families take to maintain their language and to impart 
it to their children. Moreover, as a consequence of the intimate relations that 
spring up between American and German youth, many of the former are influenced 
to complete their studies at Berlin, Leipsic, or Heidelberg, and thus the passion for 
German literature is diffused. He observes further that in the programmes of our 
leading universities German courses are generally more extended or numerous than 
the French. 
While recognizing that there are causes for the superior influence of the German 
over the French language which can not be overcome, M. le Soudier is of the opinion 
that the circulation of French books in the United States might be greatly increased, 
and he suggests practical measures for accomplishing this end. 
There were, it will be seen, business reasons for the particular attention which 
he gave to the German exhibits. 
It must be remembered that Germany was not represented in the Paris exhibitions 
of 1878 and 1889, and hence the Columbian Exposition afforded the French the first 
opportunity in twenty years for effective comparisons with their rivals. To this 
opportunity and the good judgment of the reporter we owe a most appreciative and 
reliable account of this important division of the German exhibit at Chicago. The 
value of the description is enhanced by detailed accounts of the rise and progress 
of the principal German publishing houses. 
Of the exhibition of German book dealers as a whole, M. le Soudier says: ‘‘Ger- 
many was very well represented in this section of the Exposition, and its exhibit, 
comprising a large number and variety of works, was very fine. The plan of piling 
up books upon tables left much to be desired so far as regards the effect upon the 
eye, but accomplished the desired end, which was to give the works the freest 
possible advertisement by putting them within reach of the public, not upon the 
shelves of bookcases, but, as it were, into the very hands of the visitors in such a 
manner as to excite their curiosity. Tho arrangement was not artistic, but in a 
country where Germany has so many representatives the result was not disappoint- 
   
-P-A-G-E-607
        FRENCH VIEWS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION. 597 
ing. The corresponding section in the German pavilion, situated upon the borders of 
Lake Michigan, was always filled with visitors. Two superintendents and a number 
of assistants were employed to answer inquiries and give explanations. 
“Before examining the exhibits in detail, a few words upon the German book trade 
will enable us to comprehend better the close relations that exist between the Ger- 
man book dealers, not alone those in Germany, but wherever they are established. 
“Of all countries Germany possesses the greatest number of bookstores. There 
are in all 6,104, according to the “Fiihrer durch die buchgewerbliche Kollectiv- 
Ausstellung des Deutschen Reichs” in Chicago, 1893, which contains the most inter- 
esting information upon this subject. These business houses are distributed in 
1,204 cities. Moreover, they are found in nearly every country of the world. In 
Austria there are 772; in the other States of Europe, 869; in America, 125; in Asia, 
9; in Africa, 8, and 6 in Australia. The interest has developed more readily among 
German-speaking peoples than among others; for example, in Austria-Hungary and 
in the German Cantons of Switzerland. It is represented in the most distant coun- 
tries, wherever German people have located. By theexpression ‘book trade’ must be 
understood the commerce in books properly so called, including music books, art 
books, geographical charts, etc.” 
M. le Soudier proceeds with a minute account of the manner in which business is con- 
ducted, describes the operations of the book dealers’ association, the ‘‘Borsenverein 
der deutschen Buchhiindler,” founded at Leipsic in 1825; he considers the publishing 
houses and their equipments, from which issued 22,000 new books in 1891, besides 
many reprints; discusses the growth in illustrated editions, the printing of paper 
currency, and the nature and improvement in technical processes, engraving, stereo- 
typing; the manufacture of paper, inks, binding, etc. 
With respect to the provision for technical instruction, M. le Soudier says: “It 
remains to speak of this provision which is of such immense importance to the 
development of the printing art. Besides the technical schoels maintained by the 
State, there are in all the great publishing centers special schools for the training 
of apprentices, or side by side with the schools for ordinary instruction, technical 
courses, for the benefit of the future printers. Such schools are found at Berlin, 
Leipsic, Hamburg, and Dresden, The great societies of printers also foster techni- 
cal instruction. They make periodical reports on the subject, they give exhibitions 
of the best work, and maintain technical libraries for the use of those interested. 
The Royal Academy of Fine Arts and School of Arts and Trades at Leipsic has 
founded a superior course of typographic drawing; here also are taught all the 
graphic arts, and workshops are added with a view to uniting practice and theory. 
A society, the “‘Zentralverein fiir das gesammte Buchgewerbe,” has centralized the 
technical instruction and charged itself with defending the interests of the cor- 
poration, This society possesses a remarkable museum and maintains permanent 
expositions, which are of inestimable advantage for all those who seek to perfect 
themselves in the printing art. In this museum is the famous Klemm collection of 
ineunabula, It was purchased by the Government of Saxony for about $100,000 
and presented to the ‘‘Zentralverein;” the society constantly adds to the collection 
from gifts which it receives. In the annual exhibits all improvements affecting the 
book trade are displayed, and every week new works are added to the collection. 
From time to time great expositions are opened, which afford those interested 
opportunity for perfecting themselves in the art of printing, particularly by means 
of tie various models offered for their examination. Finally, for the last four years, 
the association of printers has published an annual catalogue of models selected 
from every country and which, in this classified arrangement, can be consulted at 
one’s leisure.” 
Of our own country, M. le Soudier says: ‘‘As would naturally have been expected, 
the American book trade had full representation at Chicago; it occupied a large 
space on the western side of the Manufactures Building. The American publishers 
         
          
-P-A-G-E-608

did not join in a collective exhibit, but each house made its independent display. 
Here, again, 16 was noticeable, as in the German section, that the books were not 
exposed in closed cases, but were placed upon tables. The Americans, people of a 
practical and commercial spirit par excellence, have applied to books the means gen- 
erally employed for securing purchasers for ordinary :nerchandise; that is, to make 
the public see and appreciate them. Active and intelligent agents were present who, 
without losing sight of the business side, explained everything with great courtesy, 
and even invited visitors to examine their collections.” 
M. le Soudier then passes in review the statistics presented in the annual report of 
the Publishers’ Weekly for 1891, showing the development of the book trade in the 
United States since 1830, following this with some general observations upon the dis- 
tribution of libraries, the chief features of the system of publishing and bookselling 
among us, i.e., the retail stores, the publishing houses, the news companies, etc. 
Of the art of printing as here practiced he says: ‘Printing has reached a degree 
of development in the United States that surprises us. Whether we consider the 
printing of the great dailies with their enormous circulation—and we have seen 
already what facilities are here afforded by the Hoe presses—or of choice editions, 
“ouvrages de luxe,” the triumph of the American machines is beyond question. 
“The United States, perhaps, exceeds all other countries in the number of finely 
equipped printing houses. They work rapidly and well, both as regards the number 
of impressions and the various processes employed. There is, however, a shadow to 
the picture. It wouldseem that the proof readers are not quite equal to the require- 
ments, if we may judge from the official catalogue of the Exposition, in which mis- 
takes and misprints abounded, especially when it came to the names of exhibitors.” 
* * : * * * * 
  The peculiar excellence of American autotypes and lithographs is noted, and the 
superior quality of the paper used in American books and in journals. As in the 
easé of Germany, a detailed description is given of the exhibits of the principal 
publishing houses. Finally, after a survey of the exhibits of other countries less 
detailed than his accounts of those of Germany and of the United States, M. le 
Soudier sums up his work as follows: 
“My task is finished. I have spared no effort in its accomplishment, aiming above 
all to give a general idea, not alone of the production of books, but of the manage- 
ment of the book trade in the countries represented at Chicago. These two factors 
are intimately related, for it is beyond question that in many countries the conduct 
of the trade has a great influence upon the production and the sale of books. My 
chiof desire has been to furnish valuable information to my countrymen, 
“Although better equipped as regards implements than many of our neighbors, 
France has yet much to learn in respect to this business. The retail book dealers 
are very useful auxiliaries in our system, but many of them have not a sufficient 
understanding of the business to conduct it successfully. We need special schools 
for training booksellers, as we already have for training printers, in which young 
men who intend to take up this branch of trade may acquire the particular knowl- 
edge which relates thereto. It is necessary above all that they should acquire the 
foreign languages by an actual residence in the respective countries in order to per- 
frect themselves in the tongue, and at the same time study the commercial processes 
which differ from our own. Foreign countries offer a vast field for the circulation 
of books, but we must know them well to get an opening in them. To recapitulate 
conclusions already presented in the preceding chapters— 
“(As regards Germany, we have seen that in the production of books that country 
surpasses our own and that German books have a wider circulation abroad. Immi- 
gration explains this in great measure, and if the exportation of German books 
increases constantly, this must be attributed to the number of Germans who are 
found everywhere, and who penetrate as professors even into foreign universities, 
where they carry the language, the ideas, and as a consequence the books of their

mother country; but granting all this, we must not lose sight of the fact that a good 
organization has greatly facilitated this distribution. : 
“The United States, although it produces less, has achieved some surprising 
results, thanks to the marvelous processes in vogue, to the excellent papers and the 
perfected implements. 
“England excites admiration by the clearness and uniform excellence of its imprés- 
sions, by its fine paper and art processes, which equal those of America, from which 
they are so often borrowed. 
“Aside from these three countries, France encounters no sericus rivalry, but if we 
take the first rank in most of the branches of the industry considered, in printing, 
lithography, and binding notably, as in everything that is a matter of art and of 
taste, our rivals press hard upon us in other branches and we can not deny that the 
struggle is becoming serious. We sustain our part bravely, and it must be admitted, 
with success, but in view of the surprise that awaited us in the processes of repro- 
duction employed by the Americans, and their marvelous implements, in view of the 
large exportation of books by our neighbors across the Rhine, we should redouble 
our energies and turn our efforts to this twofold purpose, namely, to maintain the 
superiority of our manufacturing processes, improving them constantly, and to cir- 
culate our publications more and more widely by the use of all the known means of 
advertising. This would be to serve at once the interests of our own business and 
those of France.”

  CHAPTER V. 
MEDICAL INSTRUCTION IN THE UNITED STATES AS PRE- 
SEN’ 
  iD BY FRENCH SPECIALISTS. 
The measures for the reorganization and development of medical instruction in 
France, agitated for several years and culminating in the decrees of 1893, have been 
considered in full in a previous chapter of this report.!. This movement has drawn 
attention to the corresponding instruction in other countries, and naturally at the 
time of the Chicago Exposition medical instruction in the United States was a sub- 
ject of special investigation by accredited representatives of the French Government. 
Two valuable reports on the subject have appeared—one very brief, by Professor 
Bonet-Maury, member of the general council of the Paris faculties (University of 
Paris), and another extensive and exhaustive report by Dr. Marcel Baudouin, delegate 
from the French Government to the Chicago Exposition. 
Dr. Bonet-Maury confines himself to the courses preparatory to medical study in 
the United States, or rather, as we should say, the entrance requirements which are 
the index to the preparation. His matter consists very largely of these require- 
ments as published in the catalogues of the leading schools of medicine in this coun- 
try. These need not be reproduced here, as they are easily accessible in their original 
forms, and in several instances they have been greatly modified since the schemes 
quoted by Dr. Bonet-Maury were published. It is rather the reflections and com- 
parative estimates which accompany these citations from American catalogues that 
are of interest in this report. These are covered substantially by the following 
extracts: 
“There exist in the United States about 240 medical schools, 5 or 6 of which are 
exclusively reserved for women.? The course of study is generally for three years, 
the summer terms being short. The entrance requirements are very elementary. 
Of 24 schools which responded to an inquiry of the Bureau of Education in 1890, 10 
only had instituted au entrance examination, and 14 demanded some slight proof of 
eapacity on the paré of those desiring to study medicine. The condition announced 
on the majority of programmes is ‘knowledge of all branches of a good English 
education, including composition, mathematics, elements of physics, of chemistry 
and natural sciences.’ Some add the rudiments of Latin and algebra. In many 
other cases the term ‘good English education’ is defined: Knowledge of grammar, 
arithmetic, geography, and history, or merely ability to read, write, and cipher. 
Now all this is included in the programmes of the public schools; hence, in fact, the 
only condition for entrance into the majority of medical schools in America is 
‘thorough primary instruction.’ In a few schools only an account is kept of the 
number of students who have secured the degree of bachelor of arts or sciences. 
It is evident that with such a system the diplomas of doctor of medicine are very 
unequal and generally of very small value. The degree of doctor does not offer

therefore a sure guaranty to the public, and we understand the warning of one of 
our friends at our departure: ‘If you get sick in the United States, God preserve 
you from falling into the hands of an American physician; rather let a good nurse 
take care of you.’ The inconvenience of this state of things has not escaped the 
learned physicians and the universities, and there is no want of them in America, 
and for some years past no want of energetic reaction against tho notorious insuffi- 
\ ciency of requirements for entrance into the medical schools, and of the length of 
medical studies. This movement, which aims at a four-years course with at least six 
; months’ instruction each year, has found its most earnest advocates in the Illinois 
board of health, in Johns Hopkins University, and in the University of Michigan.” 
f With regard aS courses directly preparatory to the study of medicine, Dr. Bonet- 
t Maury says: f 
“So far as my knowledge goes, 8 universities of the United States have established 
preparatory courses for the medical faculty: iS The University of Pennsylvania, 
Philadelphia; (2) Cornell University, Ithaca. 3 (3) Yale University, New Haven, 
Conn.; (4) Princeton College, New Jersey; (5) tae Forest University, Tllinois; (6) 
Northwestern University, in Evanston, near Chicago, I11.; (7) Johns Hopkins U 
b sity, Baltimore, Md.; (8) University of Wisconsin, at Madison. 
; “«T shall cite as models the universities of Pennsylvania and Yale, which I have 
visited, and which seemed to me to have established the most thorough scientific 
preparation for medical studies. 
“Tn Philadelphia the instruction was organized by Dr. Pepper, president of the 
university, professor of the medical faculty, a very renowned physician, and, let me 
add also, a great admirer of the French language and literature. According to the 
rules adopted by the faculty, everybody desiring to enter upon medical studies must 
pass a written cxamination consisting of an English composition of about three hun- 
dred words and an oral examination upon the elements of physics. He is also advised 
that he will find it of great advantage to take the natural history and chemistry 
course of the college, which corresponds to our faculty of sciences. This course lasts 
for two years and comprises the following subjects:

the case also at Cornell, Princeton, Lake Forest, Northwestern University, Michi-

renowned universities, a thorough scientific preparation will soon be the- general 
condition required for admission to the study of medicine.” 
In reviewing his observations and the facts collected, Dr. Bonet-Maury says: 
“Yrom this investigation, made in the most important universities of the Atlantic 
States, Iam convinced that the men who lead the medical instruction in the United 
States are strongly exercised over the system that actually exists in the greatest 
number of medical schools. They acknowledgo the low standard of the medical 
body of their country, and attribute it to the following causes: The great number 
of medical schools, which is out of all proportion to the number and the wants of the 
population, the excessive shortness of the course of studies in general, and especially 
the facility with which the degree of doctor of medicine is secured. Remarkable 
things! The women doctors in the United States enjoy the reputation of being 
better instructed than their brothers. This comes, without doubt, from the fact 
that their colleges are less numerous, and, having more perseverance, they remain 
longer in their apprenticeship to the services of the hospital which are open to them 
before secking independent patronage.” 
The report concludes: 
“Ttis a good sign that the leaders of medical instruction in the United States 
have seen their weak points. As fast as evils are recognized the proper remedy is 
applied. The courses in the physical, natural, and biological sciences have been 
strengthened, and are considered as a preparation to or indispensable complement of 
medical studies. Moreover, these courses must be given by the professors of the fac- 
ulty of sciences or of philosophy, as they still call it in remembrance of the name 
given formerly to physics: ‘Philosophy of nature.’ 
“Tosum up, the Americans have entered resolutely that road in which we have 
already been for some time. Letus take care that they do not surpass us, for prog- 
ress in that country, as compared with us, is as much more rapid as is transmission 
by electricity than locomotion by steam.” 
THE MEDICAL SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS OF THE NORTHERN UNITED 
STATES. . 
As described by Dr. Marcen BAUDOUIN. 
INTRODUCTION. 
  Delegated by the minister of commerce to attend the Columbian Exposition, I 
arrived in the United States in the month of May, 1893, and, upon the advice of the 
comimissioner-general of the French section, I decided to utilize my time in visiting 
the principal medical schools of the Northern States and the hospitals which form 
indispensable annexes to these schools. 
To the numerous documents which I have collected in the course of my traus- 
atlantic journeyings, of which a résumé is given in this work, I have added at each 
stage of my journey, in order to break up the monotony of dry descriptions of uni- 
versities and hospitals, some reflections on the great scientific institutions of North 
America, and on the customs and manners of this interesting country, so far, at least, 
as regards the hygiene of the cities which Ivisited; also the habits and actual tend- 
encies of the Americans whom I have met, studied, and understood. 
These digressions will be pardoned, since they give life and force to descriptions 
necessarily very technical and without color. The necessity of these observations, 
which at first may appear frivolous, will be better understood, perhaps, if I add 
that the chief interest of my excursion to America seems to me to-day to lie much 
more in the examinations of the customs of this country and the causes which have 
Jed to them than in the mere descriptions of private institutions, worthy, indeed, of 
admiration, but very unlike and not easily classified. 
It will readily be seen that I was not able in these few months to study the medi- 
cal schools of the numerous centers of medical instruction which flourish at present 
     
-P-A-G-E-615
      
    
      MEDICAL INSTRUCTION IN THE UNITED STATES. 605 
  in America. I did not go to Canada, but confined my visits to the United States, and 
Ishall give only reports of the most diverse types of the institutions which I have 
myself seen and studied. 
Thus the old and renowned schools of Cambridge and Philadelphia from the first 
demanded my attention. The younger but already celebrated universities, such as 
Jolns Hopkins, of Baltimore, and Clark, of Worcester, next engaged me, and I am 
convinced they merit all the good that has been said of them in the countries of 
Europe. Some colleges, modest but worthy, such as those of San Francisco, have 
never been described by a French doctor, and I believe I shall only fulfill my duty as 
a Frenchman in making known in the mother country the story of their progress, 
thanks to the ceaseless and accumulated efforts of some of her sons settled in a 
foreign country. 
Other schools more humble, like those of Buffalo, and still others, whose rapid 
development in the new sections challenged my attention, failed not to furnish me 
curious points of comparison with our provincial schools. I was anxious to visit 
them and do not in the least regret the time consumed in these long trips to the 
far West. 
I do not know that I have succeeded in my purpose, which was to satisfy the just 
expectations of those who, doubting neither my good will nor enthusiasm, did me 
the honor to confide to me so delicate a mission, a little heavy for young shoulders. 
They will, however, permit me to recall the fact that it is the first report made in 
France, full and detailed, on medical education in the United States, with added data 
of the schools of the far West. 
What is most astonishing, one may search in vain even in America for a work 
altogether comparable to this which I have sketched. 
My predecessors have studied only the notable institutions of the East. Ihave had 
the good fortune to push my researches further, and I have only the most profound 
thanks for those who gave me with no grudging hand their kindly counsel as well 
as their material and moral aid. 
    
Dr. Baudouin considers briefly the scientific departments of the Government 
located at Washington, dwelling at some length upon the Army Medical Museum, of 
which he says: 
ARMY MEDICAL MUSEUM. 
This medical museum and library is independent of the eight medical societies of 
the country. The building, an imposing mass of red brick, is situated near the 
Smithsonian Institution. It contains two interesting collections—one the library of 
the American surgeon, well known in all the medical libraries of Europe, and the 
other similar to the ‘‘Musée Orfila” of the medical faculty of Paris, constituting the 
most complete collection of specimens of surgery in the world. 
This museum has two stories and contains a great number of anatomical specimens 
and a collection of ancient instruments, some few of which were shown in the Expo- 
sition at Chicago. The affections of the bones are the lesions best represented. 
The anatomical preparations derived from the wounded in the civil war constituted 
the basis of the collection, which has been enriched from time to time by the surgeons 
and doctors of the Army. Altogether it is like our museum of ‘ Vol de Grace.” 
Annexed to the two grand halls, in which are placed specimens preserved in alcohol 
(monsters and interesting cardiac lesions) and dried specimens (wounds, fractures by 
firearms), are two principal laboratories (histology and pathological anatomy, with 
bacteriology). We visited this institution in company with Dr. John §. Billings, 
who showed us magnificent preparations of human embryology. 
In this museum the famous library of the Surgeon-General’s Office is placed. Itis 
one of the most remarkable medical libraries of the world and the largest in America, 
comprising 200,000 volumes. It has acquired its reputation through the activity of 
its chief, Dr. John §S. Billings, who has published an index catalogue of this library, 
          
  
-P-A-G-E-616

made with the most praiseworthy care. The last volumes of this work are in press 
and soon these fifteen great folios will form a publication which no medical library 
can afford to be without. Dr. Billings showed us at the same time the hall for the 
medical journals, the halls for card catalogues, and the rooms for the librarians—a 
model to imitate; an example which no one has followed in Europe. 
MILITARY MEDICAL SCHOOL. 
A few days after my arrival at Washington a military school of medicine was 
established for the young doctors recently appointed to the Army. These students 
will have, therefore, at their disposal a museum and library of the first order. 
  After detailed description of the principal medical schools and departments of the 
Northern States, Dr. Baucowin sums up his observations substantially as follows: 
The study of the medical schools of the United States, taken as a whole, is a diffi- 
cult matter. The institutions which may be grouped under this head differ so much, 
the circumstances under which they haye been founded and are now developing 
are often so special in their nature that there is danger of falling into many errors 
and of expressing somewhat contradictory opinions if the attempt be made to 
describe these schools as a whole. If we consider also the extraordinary number of 
schools, which seems surprising at first, but is casily accounted for when one under- 
stands the general status of physicians in a country so vast, and where professional 
life is easily entered; furthermore, if one considers the facility with which institu- 
tions are formed or disappear, without leaving any trace, the simplicity also of their 
early organization, the various resources of which they may avail themselves—with 
all these considerations in view, he will understand the difficulty of making selec- 
tions out of a long list, comprising colleges, medical departments of numerous 
universities, and sometimes mere factories for ‘bogus diplomas.” 
However, to bring a certain clearness into this question, which seems at first so 
complicated, it suffices to examine it in the light of a singlo leading idea, namely, 
the basis of instruction in the United States, scientific as wellas medical. I allude 
to the complete ‘liberty of instruction.” It suffices to remember that all instruction 
is absolutely free from Government interference, as was formerly medical practice 
also, diplomas being conferred by the most dissimilar institutions. 
As everybody knows, in the transatlantic country it is private initiative which 
undertakes to furnish to the fifty States, Territories, or districts of which it is 
constituted, physicians, pharmacists, and dentists, as well as lawyers, engineers, and 
architects. The public authorities exercise a control so restricted that it may be 
called none, compared with countries where centralization reigns. 
As regards medical schools, the States confine themselves to recognizing their 
creation by according to them a charter and registering the diplomas which they 
confer, without endeavoring to ascertain tho intrinsic valuo of the same. 
There are at present in the United States several kinds of medical schools. For- 
merly the classes were still more numerous, but some have been abolished, owing to 
competition, which increases every day. 
The regular schools may be compared with those of the Old Continent, and which 
in our country are called “allopathic.” These predominate, and especially so at the 
present time, but in America, where some years ago homeopathy was appreciated by 
the majority of citizens about as much as the bonesetters in France, there exist also 
centers of homeopathic instruction which were at one time very important and 
which still enjoy much prestige. * * * Among schools called irregular schools, 
there exist also other types. I refer to the eclectic schools (eclectic colleges), and 
the physio-medical schools. 
The fraudulent schools, on the contrary, have totally disappeared. I will speak 
of them further on, but they are an invention which is dying out.
-P-A-G-E-617
               
    MEDICAL INSTRUCTION IN THE UNITED STATES. 607 
  In the regular schools one principal feature is noticeable. Some are attended by 
men and women, and the students of both sexes are admitted to these without diffi- 
culty, pass their examinations side by side, as in Europe, and obtain their diplomas. 
A smaller number are exclusively reserved for young women students of medicine, 
These institutions haye no analogy anywhere, and this is an Amezican specialty 
which deserves more than simple mention. 
But whatever the varicty, all these schools are of an essentially private order; all 
have been originated by private individuals, and generally in the following manner: 
A very rich manufacturer or a successful speculator (there are but few other lucra- 
tive professions in the United States) gives from his fortune, and often although, 
he has children (which is also a marked characteristic of the country beyond the 
ocean), considerable sums for the foundation of a university. First, very elementary 
instruction is organized; then, when other liberal gifts have increased the resources, 
professional schools are successively ereated—an important expedient for the grad- 
uated students—and rapidly enough a medical department. This was the case nearly 
three hundred years ago with Harvard University at Cambridge, near Boston, and 
has taken place at the present time in Worcester (Clark University), in Chicago 
(Rockefeller University), in Washington, San Francisco, ete. 
At other times the practicing physicians of a city which is young but flourishing 
and with promise of a successful future together found a school. In this case it is 
ordinarily called “College of Physicians and Surgeons.” It must be confessed that 
what prompts this action is the desire of the physicians to add to their title of doctor 
of medicine that of professor moro than the wish to be useful to their fellow-citizens 
or to the future young men of the country. But what does it matter since these 
local attempts soon result in schools full of life and enthusiasm which become 
vigorous rivals of the older establishments. The latter are thus prevented from 
reposing upon their laurels and forced onward incessantly. These physicians write 
out statutes, elect a council of administration, and request the State authorities to 
inscribe the new creation in the official registers. This is seldom refused, and is 
  equal to a regular authorization. Then prospectuses are freely issued in order to 
announce the new creation; the medical papers publish the course and the list of 
the professors, who but yesterday were simple physicians, more or less unknown. 
This is business; it must be hurried, and here, as everybody knows, the Americans 
are at home. Students come in greater or less numbers, and in the second year diplo- 
mas are distributed. Is not the good will of those who, from the very beginning, 
have shown confidence in the enterprise and in the professional ability of the young 
teachers, to be encouraged? The graduates are then permitted to practice medicine 
in the State where the school is established and often in almost all the States or Ter- 
ritories of the Union. 
At first the resources of the schoo] are limited, as the fees of the students and the 
sums given by the founders are the only sources of revenue. The buildings are rudi- 
mentary, and the laboratories poor and meagerly equipped. But if by chance some 
distinguished and energetic person has come into the corporation, reputation docs 
not wait for the lapse of years, and endowments inerease. Splendid iron and brick 
buildings aro erected, dispensaries and soon hospitals are founded. 
Thus, following the examples of similar institutions which exist in England, the 
principal colleges for surgeons and physicians in the Union have developed the old 
colleges of Philadelphia, New York, Boston, San Francisco, ete. 
Forsome years past this liberty seems to have been alittle restrained, and now in cer- 
tain cities diplomas can not be obtained with the same facility. Everywhere, indeed, 
where boards of health are organized the parchments presented for inscription are 
earefully examined, and if it is discovered that the school by which they were issued 
confers them too casily, they are not registered. This occurred some years ago in 
New Jersey, and a college where the examiners exposed the fact that too much indul- 
gence was shown toward students was forced to shut its doors. 
   
-P-A-G-E-618
   
   608 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
The Mlinois State board of health has endeavored with remarkable zeal to search 
out those institutions which are still questionable, and to this end it has published a 
prospectus setting forth the minimum of qualifications required from a school in 
order that it should be classified among those giving satisfaction. But, as may be 
imagined, many do not yet correspond to the required conditiuns, although recently 
very remarkable progress in this respect has been accomplished almost everywhere. 
  Moreover, since 1877, there has existed an “ Association of Medical Colleges,” which 
has succeeded in grouping together into a strong society all those schools which 
desire that the level of the studies should be raise The statutes of this association 
_ are such that at present all the colleges that are members of it may be considered 
as representing sufficient guaranties, for none of the irr at schools can be admitted 
there. In acountry like the United States one can not ask more, and this control of 
the institutions by cach other is certainly excellent; all this is very characteristic 
of this extraordinary country. 
Certainly I would not say that all these colleges are comparable to the European 
faculties, and that their diplomas are equivalent to those which are conferred in 
Germany, France, or in the cities of other European countries; but one must not ask 
the impossible; and in a country where superior instruction does not hold the first 
place it is not surprising that the students know a little less Latin or Greek than 
ours, and do not devote themselves willingly to transcendental studies. 
At the present time North America possesses 122 regular schools conferring diplo- 
mas either on men or women; but of these 9 are exclusively reserved for women. 
With the 113 others must also be classed the regular post-graduate schools, which 
receive only students having already graduated, practitioners who desire to perfect 
their clinical instruction. These institutions may be compared with the German 
and Austrian polyclinics and other preparatory or special schoo!s (schools for anat- 
omy, etc.), upon which I can not dwell here. 
The 113 regular schools, which I will now consider, show certain common char- 
acteristics. They are seldom installed in grand edifices. The most important, that 
of the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, is nothing more than a modest 
building of moderate dimensions. The same is the case in New York, Boston, San 
Francisco. Often there is only an ordinary building of four stories, with halls for 
lectures, laboratories for chemistry, physiology, histology. Frequently a dispensary 
is annexed and occupies a part of the basement. Almost always (fact to be noted) 
the hall for dissections is found at the top of the house. We may say: ‘They dis- 
sect under the roof.” In this way, I am told, more light and air are secured, odors 
are not detected, and it is altogether more private. Naturally, the whole building 
is heated by steam, which circulates in pipes; it is lighted by electricity and 
abundantly provided with ice water, the beverage of the American citizen; no 
apartment for the dean, no imposing place for busin transactions—nothing but 
what is necessary; a lodging for the porter, or rather for the watchman, for porters 
do not exist there. 
All that does not belong absolutely to the medical department is consigned to the 
other buildings of the university. This explains also the absence of a physical 
laboratory, and also the rare appearance of laboratories of natural history. More- 
over, physics is not taught in the American schools. 
The budgets are very limited, save in rich institutions, which are admirably 
endowed, as Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore; often, also, the future is dis- 
counted. Appeals for funds are never made to the Central Government or to the 
municipalities. Very seldom does the State in which the college is located inter- 
vere to make up the expenses (the principal exception is the University of Ann 
Arbor, Mich., which possesses an old and highly esteemed medical department) ; the 
official subvention is unknown. Anyone can bea doctor in a few years in the United 
States, contrary to the custom in our old Europe, where a very careful preparatory 
instruction is necessary in order that one should obtain the degree of doctor. In 
America one may be at 20 years of age a grocer or a farm boy, at 22 a journalist, at

MEDICAL INSTRUCTION IN THE UNITED STATES. 609 
25 a lawyer or a doctor of medicine. The medical career is a profession like any 
other, and the epithet “liberal” would not be understood in a country where only 
one thing is desired, namely, to gain with the greatest rapidity the greatest possible 
amount of money; where the effort is only te perfect one’s self in his art in order to 
get still richer. Therefore, of course, no one thinks of erecting high barriers at the 
entrances to the schools, 
This is the reason why admission into a medical college is so very easy. It is suffi- 
cient to have graduated from a secondary school which is approved by the State in 
which one desires to study; in other words, to possess a diploma corresponding 
more or less to our ancient certificate of grammar, or to undergo a very easy exami- 
nation, which means simply it is necessary to know English and a little Latin. To 
sum up, the American physician must have a general education which is scarcely 
equal to that of our health officers. 
The professional courses which the students must follow bear a close analogy to 
those which the professors of our provincial schools have to take. The lectures 
even at Philadelphia and New York hardly bear comparison with those in the facul- 
ties of Bordeaux and Nancy. In America there is nothing to be compared with the 
faculties of Lyons, and especially those of Paris. The theoretical courses are gen- 
erally good, but elementary; the exercises in dissection are, as a rule, rudimentary. 
The practical work, except in chemistry, leaves also much to be desired. On the 
contrary, this is not the same with the dental schools, the triumphs of the United 
States. 
There are no competitive examinations; all professors are appointed by choice. 
Almost all are young and enjoying an income which at first appears very large; but, 
all things considered, thé conditions are about the same as in our own country. It 
must be remembered that life is expensive there; that pensions do not exist; that 
the long trips necessary in that country demand great expense, etc. 
The Yankee student, who never forgets the watchword of his fatherland, “Time 
is money,” desires to finish his studies rapidly. He takes without much complaint 
a number of courses, lectures, quizzes, and subquizzes, which are perpetually pre- 
sented him from 8 o’clock in the morning until 5 in the evening, save Saturday even- 
ing, for, like the laborer, he holds fast to this vacation of half a day. Only he who 
desires to devote himself to a professorship in a large university, works frum love of 
science, if not of the special art. The majority attend schools where they may get 
immediately to work, where nothing is very difficult. This explains the rapid sue- 
cess of all new enterprises. The clinic instruction is a little more serious, thanks 
to the luxury which prevails in the teaching of the specialties. There isno small 
school which has not special professors of laryngology, otology; rhinolgy, orthopedy, 
etc. Inspite of that the final examinations are not brilliant. If they should prove 
too severe, it would frighten the student, who would hasten to join a rival school. 
An important question for the future of American medicine and one which has 
already excited great discussion, is that of the length of the courses in the different 
colleges. Not more than ten years ago, in a great center, doctors were made in two 
years! But at the present time three years are demanded, with sessions of eight 
months each. Few schools require four years; but several advise their students to 
study four years. Evidently there is progress; but that is not sufficient. I will- 
ingly admit that the American loses less time than the Frenchman, yet I shall never 
believe that he can learn in three years what it takes us five or six years to impart. 
Four years’ attendance would not be too long even in the United States. This would 
certainly be better than to be obliged finally to attend a post-graduate school, par- 
ticularly as those who practice in the country never can profit by these advanced 
schools. 
The post-graduate schools in America are organized like other schools, with teach- 
ing corps whose numbers surprise a European; but in reality, when the whole 
situation is learned, they are found to differ little from the German or Austrian 
polyclinics. 
ED 93——39 
 
-P-A-G-E-620
610 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  All specialties are taught in the post-graduate schools; and in those of established 
reputation, as those of New York, among others, are represented by teachers of 
undoubted authority. Unfortunately it is not the same in all cities; it has been 
justly stated that the professors are not always men adequately equipped for the 
functions which they perform In these institutions which pretend to be superior 
schools for perfecting students, the corps of teachers ought to be picked from the 
very best. Complaint has also been made that the professors are sometimes induecd 
to take their positions solely for money. In delicate matters like these it is necessary 
to look carefully at the results accomplished. Now, it is unquestionable that these 
post-graduate schools are of real service, allowing young doctors to complete their 
studies and to be better armed for the battle. It is not necessary to ask more—to 
hope, for example, to see them transformed some day into so many medical “Colléges 
de France.” Besides, the American, who especially appreciates the useful, would not 
make this his aim. : 
There are at this time 19 post-graduate schools; but only 15 of them are regular 
schools; 4 are irregular, 2 being homeopathic and 2 eclectic. The earliest were 
founded in 1882 in New York, Philadelphia, and St. Louis; there are also similar 
schools in Boston, Baltimore, New Orleans, and in other cities, which I have already 
mentioned. 
One might well desire that in Paris some analogous schools should be organized, 
as we possess already all the essentials for this, thanks to the medico-chirurgical 
corps of our hospitals, but our customs and our extraordinary admiration for all 
ancient institutions will prevent us for a long time from entertaining this idea. 
The other regular schools of medicine which we have stjll to examine are those 
which are exclusively reserved for women. 
Whether familiar or not with the American customs and with the famous question 
of coeducation, the European physician does not understand at once the reason for, 
and the importance of, these creations. We are told that in the United States many 
young women wish to study medicine. Very well! But why do they not attend the 
ordinary schools, as from their earliest youth until leaving the high schools they 
in intimate companionship with the young men, on the same “campus,” sometimes 
under the same roof, eating at the same table. 
Why are they more particular than their comrades in the schools of architecture, 
even in the law schools, who haye no college reserved exclusively forthem? What 
is the reason of this sudden change of opinion in a country where the system of 
eoeducation has been so freely extended? It is only by recalling what happened 
when women attempted to force the doors of those schools which they could not 
easily enter that one comprehends why these special colleges came into existence. 
America is certainly the country where the problem of the woman doctor is to be 
studied; but it must not be supposed that in the beginning this little revolution in 
customs was accomplished without all kinds of opposition to the pioneers who 
sought to climb over the barrier erected at the entrance into the liberal professions 
by the most powerful half of mankind. At first the older American schools declined 
to admit young women. Such opposition might succeed elsewhere, but to suppose 
that it would do so in the case of Americans is to misprize their resources and the 
disposition of the women. Werethe American women overcome by opposition? No. 
This would have shown unpardonable shortsightedness, an insult to the national 
genius! The outcome proves that in this country “What woman wills, God wills!” 
The women, resolved not to confess themselves vanquished, went to work with that 
patience the secret of which they alone know, which serves them always when they 
desire to attain a particular end. They did so well that out of the very opposition 
they secured the foundation of special schools, which at the present time have become 
rival institutions, sometimes dangerous rivals, if account be taken of the standard 
of studies in the other regular colleges. 
The result of this is that at the present time the United States possesses 9 regular 
schools of this kind (there must be counted, too, a homeopathic school), which are

situated in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Baltimore, Minneapolis, St. Louis, Cin- 
cinnati (where there are already two), and Atlanta. I visited some of them, especi- 
ally the most celebrated, that of Philadelphia, of which I secured a photograph. It 
must be admitted that this is one of the objective points in a medical transatlantic 
excursion. The first of these schools was founded at Boston in 1848. It conferred 
diplomas until 1874, at which time it united with a homeopathic school. Thesecond 
in date, and the one which is considered to be the type, the veritable mother of all 
the women’s colleges, is the celebrated College of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, 
which dates from 1850; the buildings were reconstructed in 1875. 
These schools are almost as well organized as those opened to both men and 
women. Certainly the courses, which only last for three years, are not brilliant; 
the entrance examinations are easy, the studies elementary, the examinations on 
leaving somewhat weak. But is not this true also of the regular schools? Besides, 
the women foilow the studies with the greatest regularity. A little uncertain of 
their power and ability, they make so much the greater effort, as they desire to 
raise still higher the standard of their emancipation and to prove that they are fully 
equal to their brothers and friends in the rival institutions. They have, moreover, 
a solid elementary education, often even more solid than that of men (this is the 
rule in America), and have shown on different occasions that they were able to face 
the combat and to get out of it with all the honors of war. The corps of teachers 
is never composed exclusively of women. In Philadelphia about half the professors 
are men. In New York, Chicago, and elsewhere the proportion of women professors 
is still smaller. Hence it would seem that up to the present time the number could 
not be fully supplied from female physicians. But this is not the sole reason; other 
considerations lead also to the choice of men. These schools conferred in ten years 
(1880-1890) 635 diplomas, a respectable number, which indicates sufficiently how 
important a position women physicians have reached in the New World. For tho 
exact total we must add tothe number given the number of diplomas conferred 
upon women by other regular schools. As to these colleges, itisundeniable that the 
fruits have yielded what the flowers promised. In America, then, the female doctor 
is no longer an exception; in a few years, in.the cities at least, she will play a part 
which is as yet only suggested. 
The history of the schools called irregular is not less curious nor less interesting; 
and among these latter some are so near their end that those who desire to know 
their character and their method must visit them as soon as possible. In a few 
years, without doubt, it will be too late. The fraudulent schools exist nomore. So 
far as I have been able to ascertain, they were constituted by medical associations, 
conferring doctors’ diplomas for money. Their students had scarcely to follow the 
courses for three months. They had atone time, it appears, a certain success. This 
could be easily understood; but I donot guarantee the statement. Certainly all this 
is now a chapter of very old history, at least for the Americans, atthe rate things 
move in their country. 
The physio-medical schools number only two, one in Indianapolis, Ind., founded 
in 1873, the other, later, in Chicago. That of Indiana is the type of these institu- 
tions, which are on the decline from day to day. The conditions for admission are 
the same as in the regular colleges, and the courses are comparable, although still 
more elementary. 
These schools, it appeared to me, were more elementary than those of the other 
classes. Instruction in them is rather theoretical than practical, and the clinic 
exercises are reduced to the most simple form. In fact, I am not prepared myself to 
give any particulars, on account of the short time I was in Chicago (the courses are 
finished at the end of June). Other French physicians who have crossed the Atlan- 
tic have not been more fortunate in this respect. If I may venture an opinion, I 
should say that these schools do not seem to me to differ at all from the others - 
except inname. In America, where simple minds abound, where all is industry and 
commerce, it is often sufficient to change the denomination of a ware in order to.

612 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  give it a greater value in the eyes of the public. I am afraid that it may have been 
the same with the physio-medical institutions. 
The eclectic schools are more flourishing, but there are only 10 in existence, 
namely, at Cincinnati, New York, Chicago, St. Louis, Atlanta, San Francisco, Des 
Moines, and Indianapolis. ‘These institutions differ from the regular medical depart- 
ments of the universities and colleges of medicipe by the nature of the courses in 
medical subjects, therapeutics, and internal clinics. But the difference is only on 
these points, as in the homeopathic schools. 
In these schools all metals, without exception, are excluded from therapeutics, or, 
as the eclectic physicians say, iron, potassium, sodium, mercury, etc.—all this is of 
no value; only the substances taken from the vegetable kingdom, such as extracts, 
tinctures, alcohols, balms, etc., have efficiency. As a matter of fact, this is not true, 
because it is demonstrated that metals have great efficiency. But where religion 
commences, science must not interfere. I must confess that I had not time to examine 
this matter for myself, but from what I could learn there seemed to me less difference 
between an eclectic school anda regular school than between the latter and a homeo- 
pathic school. The homeopathic schools are more numerous and more prosperous. 
In 1893 they numbered 17, of which 1, in New York, was exclusively reserved for 
women. There were, besides, two post-graduate schools of the same ciass. I do not 
exaggerate in saying that these schools are as unknown in France as the eclectic or 
physio-medical schools; all our classics are silent on the subject. 
These schools are found in most of the cities of the Union, in New York, 
Philadelphia—where are the oldest and most celebrated of those which exist 
to-day—Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Boston, Ann Arbor (University 
of Michigan), Iowa City (State University), San Francisco, Minneapolis (University 
of Minnesota), Kansas City, and Baltimore. 
This is not the place to explain the homeopathic doctrine. It is well known in 
our country and by the readers of the Scientific Review. I will only say that the 
ideas of Hahnemann, which were given out about the year 1790, have, in less than 
one hundred years, conquered a good part of America. For almost a century, the 
homeopathic schools have flourished in these places of liberty. * * * 
The studies in these schools last only for three years; but there are many pupils. 
In respect to everything outside of therapeutics the best known of these schools 
are equal to the regular schools. It is interesting to note that sometimes, as in 
Iowa, Ann Arbor, and Minneapolis, the homeopathic school and the allopathic school 
are represented in the same university, and that, accordingly, many professors are 
common to both schools. There are only special professors for the courses of medi- 
cine and clinics. For instance, it is frequently the case that there is one professor of 
obstetrics, rhinology, or homeopathic chirurgy. 
Ihave in vain asked myself what difference there could be between an accouche- 
ment or an amputation performed in this or that manner. I have tried to enlighten 
myself on this point and I could not find a solution. No one could help me in soly- 
ing the problem. It would be very interesting to compare the extraordinary siiccess 
which homeopathy has, and especially has had, for some years in America with the 
indifference which it has met with in our ancient schools of unquestionable stand- 
ing. In Europe it may be said there are no schools of this kind. The physicians 
who devote themselves more or less to this profession have undergone the examina- 
tion in classics before our faculties, and have instructed themselves in the doctrine 
and its applications in some hospitals of limited number and little importance. In 
the United States the homeopathic colleges confer diplomas which have the same 
value as those of the regular schools, and which enjoy indisputable consideration 
from the public authorities. 
Taking all together and adding to the institutions we have already mentioned 10 
» preparatory schools or annexes of little interest, there existed in the United States in 
1893 (I state intentionally the precise year, for probably in 1894 the number will be 
different on account of new creations or shipwrecks) 181 medical schools, of which 
     
-P-A-G-E-623
  
MEDICAL INSTRUCTION IN THE UNITED STATES. 613 
152 conferred diplomas, located in 68 cities. The territory of the United States 
maintains at present 70,000,000 inhabitants; this gives, in round numbers, a center of 
instruction for 400,000 inhabitants and 23,000 square miles. If one compares these 
numbers with those furnished by French statistics, it appears that we have one 
school for 1,600,000 inhabitants and 10,000 square miles. The Americans possess, 
therefore, four times as many schools as we in proportion to the number of inhabitants 
of the two countries.!. This manifest excess is easily explained by the ‘liberty of 
teaching,” and by the desperate competition between the schools. This explains, 
also, why in America colleges fall to pieces like castles of cards; become bank- 
rupt sometimes after long years of financial prosperity and normal success. Within 
one hundred years more than 100 schools have gone down on account of this evident 
disproportion between the needs of the country and its means of production— 
between supply and demand. It is also one of the causes of the weakness of the 
courses. 
In spite of this, in proportion as the unsettled regions become peopled, new 
centers of instruction will be created in the East and the far West. The average 
number of doctors furnished by each school seems also higher than that of the 
European schools. This proves that we exaggerate a little if we follow exclusively 
the statistical information in order to judge of the causes and the effects of this 
multiplicity of schools. 
I could not learn the number of scholars who attended these centers of medical 
instruction in 1893, but I could get the number for the school years 1880-81 and 
1890-91. They are eloquent enough to be quoted. In the year 1880-81 there were 
11,864 students of medicine in the United States, of whom 9,750 were in the regular 
schools, 1,234, 826, and 54 in the homeopathic, eclectic, and physio-medical schools, 
respectively. For 1890-91 I noted in all 14,884 students, of whom 13,044 were 
regular, 1,128 homeopathic, 661 eclectic, 51 physiomedical. 
It is evident that these statistics, which are very exact, permit us to make a fair 
conclusion in the sense indicated in this article. There can be no doubt that these 
regular schools are progressing. The increase of 3,000 students in ten yearsis a 
sufficient proof of this. It is, furthermore, beyond doubt that the irregular schools 
go down from day to day, that the physio-medical schools exist only in name, and 
that the eclectic colleges are not flourishing. As to the homeopathic schools, in 
respect to the number of students they make a good showing. 
Let me add, also, that the surprises and the easy pleasantry of the beginning of 
my voyage gave way in time to something of pity and benevolence. In this dizzy 
course which America has followed in the matter of public instruction the whole 
nation has shown the resources of its indomitable energy, and especially its love 
for liberty. As wealth and power increase it appears that the ambition of the rich 
who have founded fortunes must turn itself toward the culture of mind. This is 
the right way. Let us congratulate America. The end is perhaps distant, but with 
the ability Americans have in overcoming distances it must be attained soon.

    POPULAR EDUCATION IN THE UNITED 
By Signor CommenparorE Lurat Bopto, STATES. 
   Director of the Royal Statistical Bureau, Rome, Italy. 
I had the good fortune to visit the Exposition at Chicago during the autumn 
of the past year (1893). One of the most vivid and profound impressions made 
upon me during the fifty days passed in the States was produced by the prodigious 
activity among the people. What interested me especially, within the Exposition 
as well as without, was the organization of public instruction, so that to-day my 
intention is te say a few words in regard to the American elementary schools. The 
attendance upon the public schools is three times as great as in Italy. The number 
of persons enrolled during the year in Italy in proportion to the inhabitants is 74 per 
eent, while in the United States the average attendance is 20 per cent. The 
countries of Europe which are the best supplied with schools stand between these 
two extremes. In Franecé'the enrollment in proportion to the inhabitants is 12} per 
cent; the per cent is similar in Austria; in Prussia it is 18 per cent; in England and 
Wales, 17 per cent. The schools in America are housed in more spacious buildings 
than elsewhere; the salaries are greater than anywhere else, so that the expend- 
iture for the public elementary school in America to each inhabitant is not only 
more than three times as great as in Italy, as is the case with the enrollment, but 
it is six times as great. Among the Italians the state, the communes, and proy- 
inces expend 62,000,000 lire (the ordinary and extraordinary expenditures included) 
for elementary instruction—that is, 2 lire (38.6 cents) per capita of the population of 
the Kingdom—while in the United States the expenditures amount to $146,000,000— 
that is, 12 lire ($2.31) to each inhabitant. Salaries of malo teachers average 4,500 
lire ($838); of women teachers, 1,500 lire ($675); the women form about 65 per cent, 
the men 35 per cent of the whole number of teachers. 
The methods employed in carrying out the laws pertaining to obligatory instruc- 
tion are dissimilar to those in America. In the city of New York 12 inspectors had 
charge of this phase of the school question, and it is no rare thing to see a police- 
615

man (truant officer) who, meeting a boy upon the street during school hours, ques- 
tions him as to his being a truant, conducts him to his home, and finds out the reasons 
for such absence; if it is found that he is playing truant, the justice of the peace 
disciplines him by placing him in a reformatory. * * * 
The rivalry between the States is such that each one desires to have the best school 
buildings, the best methods, the best text-books, and the best hygienic conditions, 
and the reports published annually by Commissioner Harris are a guide toward 
improvement in all directions. Anyone entering the American schools is impressed 
with the general cleanliness, the perfect order, and the sentiment of self-respect 
which pervade the atmosphere. The best arrangement of rooms, of windows for 
light, the best means of heating and ventilating, are studied. Then there are seats, 
one for each pupil, revolving chairs, slates, and blackboards, so that not more than 
two children work in close proximity to each other, and there is no crowding. Tho 
children by turning about on their chairs can direct their view to any part of the 
room. There is no need of hiding anything within the desks, and so the schcol, by 
the very arrangement of its furniture, becomes a means of forming a loyal character 
and of rendering the pupil alert, self-reliant, and respectful in bearing. Each school 
has a central room in which the classes congregate when entering and leaving. In 
silence and with a composed bearing, children of both sexes march along. The 
teacher leads the march by playing on the piano and a patriotic hymn is sung, but 
there are no orders given as to the marching. On entering and leaving school the 
same method is employed; girls to the right, boys to the left, is the mode of march. 
The sight was one that moved me greatly, as if it were a generous action for the 
honoring of humanity. fs 
Truly, in the school is found the future of this wonderful people. I do not speak 
of the object lessons which are practically carried out in every school, and which 
habituate the children to reflect, to formulate thought, and to comprehend the mat- 
ter studied. The elements of botany, for instance, are taught in such a manner 
that each child is supposed to form for itself a small herbarium. Rewards are not 
given at the close of the year to the pupil who has distinguished himself the most 
in his studies. There are examinations, however, if the teacher has refused promo- 
tions to the pupils, the parents may demand a formal proof, the examination being 
therefore a kind of court of appeals. 
Drawing is an essential element of the primary school course, the students, both 
boys and girls, become first experts in drawing, then in reading, writing, language, 
natural history, etc. 
Moreover, there are normal schools for instruction in drawing and the plastic 
arts; a remarkably fine one is found in Boston. Drawing is considered as a means 
of learning and of communicating thought, and not alone from its wsthetic side; 
drawing is, so to speak, an alphabet for expressing the conceptions. The children 
are taught to come forward and in the simplest manner to sketch on the boards 
celebrated men, figures from natural history and from political history, or, again, 
they may be asked to illustrate a poem, such as Longfellow’s Evangeline. Another 
means of illustrating the lessons given is by the magic lantern, with which land- 
scapes, colored pictures, etc., are thrown on the canvas. 
Still another form of instruction is noticeable in America; this includes manual 
training schools, where the shops and the forge for boys, cooking and sewing for 
girls, alternate with lessons in histury, geography, English, German, and Latin 
languages. 
The elementary schools in general haye eight years in the course. It can well be 
said that for the duration of the course, and for the methods employed in utilizing 
the time allowed, instruction is organized in the United States on a rational basis; 
more than this, it is liberal and democratic, as it procures for all a minimum of 
eulture, which gives the people a high grade of cultivation as compared with many 
of the European peoples. The school is really the people’s school, and the American

nation may well be proud of it. One recognizes at once how strongly the people feel 
in regard to the school question. In the educational department of the Chicago 
Exposition one of the Western States—Dakota, if I remember rightly—had pasted 
above the entrance ‘Education is the cheaper defense of the country.” 
EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. 
By Prof. A. GuisLert. 
MUNICIPAL SCHOOLS OF NEW YORK, 
The agreeable impression made upon a person visiting the schools of America is 
enhanced by the well-constructed, well-ventilated, and well-aired buildings. The 
number of such buildings would indicate that American architects had made a 
special study and established a certain type of edifice, thus solving the problem of 
simplicity and commodiousness in all respects, hygienic and pedagogic as well. In 
the school buildings, as in all public edifices, there is no Cerberus guarding the 
door. In some of the schools a bright, active youth fulfills the duties of custodian, 
possibly for the day, and conducts you without any formality to the gentleman or 
lady principal. In each room is a placard indicating the maximum of pupils who 
can be accommodated. ‘This serves as a guide to teacher and pupils, and in case of 
an excess of numbers they refer to this in their appeal to the authorities. In the 
school which I visited 45 pupils was the maximum. The rooms are not large, for in 
New York the ground is costly, but they are high, and the heat and ventilation are 
modified according to wish. No room contains the long bench or desk, with the 
stationary seat, incommodious and antididactic, which is to be found in about 80 
per cent of the schools of Italy, the secondary technical and classical schools 
inelnded. In the cooking schools each pupil has her own seat and desk; in the other 
rooms two pupils are seated together. The desk is movable and inclined and per- 
mits the child’s free movements; the seat turns on a screw, so that each pupil can 
move about from right to left as he desires without disturbing his neighbors and 
can bring himself into proper relation with the blackboard. The blackboard is not 
found resting on an upright frame, where it occupies space and intercepts the light, 
but the walls of the room are literally lined with these boards, and the pupil can 
draw his exercises upon the boards without disturbing any one of his companions, 
and they in turn can follow whatever the teacher jots down upon the boards by 
simply turning about without even incommoding one another. But for exercises in 
arithmetic, for drawing, and for such exercises as all the pupils ought to carry on 
simultaneously, there are slates in use from the first class on. Socratic and objective 
methods are in vogue, and by means of illustrations and exercises, in all of which 
the whole room joins, the teacher and pupils are, in a measure, carrying on a type 
of spontaneous conversation or interchange of ideas. Another valuable feature is 
that the teacher has no special chair or desk. In Italy such a desk is raised from the 
floor; but the American teacher moves about from place to place, and the arrange- 
ment of the revolving seats gives the pupils opportunity to follow him in whatever 
explanation he may be giving on the blackboards or by other means of illustra- 
tion. I have every reason for believing that when I visited a group of schools on 
Greenwich street my visit was entirely unexpected, and yet I found the teacher 
standing before the blackboard, or in the midst of the pupils, all of whom were 
turned toward him, and it seemed as if I had interrupted an interesting dialogue 
in which all were participating. This method of instruction by moving among the 
pupils and conversing with them so engages the attention that it seems unnecessary 
to have any special means foc keeping up discipline. ‘The pupils, being visible from 
all quarters, have no opportunity or desire for concealment, and thus the school, by 
the arrangement of desks and chairs, becomes in itself an instrument for the forma- 
tion of a loyal character and for the foundation of freedom of deportment.   
-P-A-G-E-628
  618 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93, 
Each school building has a central room, or hall, where the classes meet when 
entering and leaving school. From 400 to 800 pupils may come together there; it 
all depends upon the size of the school. The hall is so furnished with seats equi- 
distant from one another that such a number of children find their places or leave 
the room with the greatest ease. The signal for the march is given on the piano, 
and two by two they fall into place, singing a patriotic air or repeating verses of a 
nonsectarian character, the girls to the right, the boys to the left, and march 
along to the entrance. It is truly an interesting sight, as if with their songs they 
were honoring humanity; and the unembarrassed and unassuming deportment of 
the American school children always confronted me and led me to meditate as to 
the causes which brought this state of things about. _ 
One thing whieh seemed to me essentially American is the fire escape, to be used 
only in ease of fire. By these fireproof stairways the three to eight hundred 
children were supposed to escape in case of fire, and in each room a doorway led 
to this stairway. American forethought does not end there. It would be humiliat- 
ing to indicate how many (or how few) schools in Italy, even in the most populous 
districts, are furnished with these means of safety. If an architect were to make 
such arrangement, the doorways and stairways would be absolutely hidden from 
the pupils’ vision. But the practical spirit of the Americans goes further; it 
includes the practice (twice a month) in the use of these fire escapes; the signal 
given, the pupils move with the utmost celerity toward and down the fire escape, 
and in a moment are in the court or on the street. These movements are supervised 
by the teacher, and, oftentimes repeated, bring about precision and perfection of 
discipline. The parents themselves have less fear for their children, knowing that 
they are well drilled for such emergency. Here again another aspect of the Ameri- 
ean school impresses one, to wit, the courage inculeated and the quickness of 
thought necessary for any occasion. 
There are no decorations in the class rooms, eh in the eentral room, where all are 
congregated together, there are busts or pictures of Presidents of tho Republic or 
other ornamentation. Atlases, diagrams, natural-history charts, etc., are not lack- 
ing in any school building, but they are not found in conjunction with the black- 
boards. These stand forth in their plainness, which is only broken in upon by the 
necessary door and window frames. In pedagogical fields, as in other fields of 
action in America, the effort is to obtain the greatest results with the minimum of 
means to such end. Geographic maps are closed up with wooden casings, each eon- 
taining a series, so that they can be moved from room to room as they are wanted. 
They are so arranged that they can be hung up and opened to the map desired, 
while the other maps still remain encased. Pictures, models, and other objects 
required in the studies pursued are kept in cases, and simply placed before the 
scholars when needed. Thus one picture or model can be used in different rooms, 
and is kept clean and in good order. The pupil, too, does not have his atten- 
tion distracted from day to day by these aids to study. In Italy these wall maps, 
etc., are always stationary on the walls. The pupil profits more by seeing these 
maps, diagrams, ete., only when needed for use, than if they were before him every 
Mawes 
Some of the newer American cities, like Chicago, St. Paul, and San Francisco, have 
arranged their schools according to the very newest methods, and their programmes 
have theoretico-practical innovations in accordance with the latest pedagogical 
developments. In comparison with our Italian schools many comments and sug- 
gestions might be made, but I will limit myself to stating that in none of our 
scholastic institutions is the programme of study carried out practically from day 
to day as itis in the American schools. We have programmes, decrees, and regula- 
tions which are exeellent in themselves, but even the ministers and Congress seem 
unable to carry them out, as, for instance, in the ease of the laws of compulsory edu- 
cation. In America the regulations are few im number, precise, and clear, and they
-P-A-G-E-629
  
EUROPEAN COMMENTS ON AMERICAN EDUCATION. 619 
do not suffer all sorts of changes and interpretations on the part of principals and 
superintendents, and these regulations indicate what is really carried out. Conse- 
quently one observes that the schools are really advancing more rapidly and carn- 
. estly than one would surmise from a mere reading of their programmes. 
The public schools of New York and most of the larger and smaller cities are 
administered by a local school council. This council has different names (school 
committee, school directors, school commissioners, school board) in the various 
States and cities. The methods of clecting the members, the number of them, and 
their duties vary also; still their aims are identical, inasmuch as they represent the 
wish and opinions of the people. Boston has a school council of 116 members, and 
this is one of the largest. In some States women are members of the school board; 
in other States their names may be used even if they can not be elected. A few 
cities have the members appointed by the mayor instead of being elected by the 
people. Among these is New York, which can not in this respect be regarded as 
possessing the genuine type of school organization of North America. Still this is 
the city which, through immigration and its commercial connection with other coun- 
tries, is most affected by European influences. * * * 
The New York City school board has a superintendent as aid, who corresponds in 
part to the “‘provveditore general” of Italy. His authority, from the moral stand- 
point, is great, and he is generally a person of special culture, expert in educational 
affairs, and known to the public as of indisputable pedagogical and literary merit. 
* * * The superintendent has manifold duties, which include inspection of 
schools, assisting at the examination of teachers, selecting educational apparatus, 
deciding in regard to repairs, revising accounts, making a report at close of the 
year, ete. a 
In order to correct an error Which has been often repeated by men of culture, by 
ministers in Italy, and by Italian educational journals, it is well to state that the 
primary and grammar schools of the municipality of New York are gratuitous. 
The school tax (tassa scolastica), as it is referred to in some of the States, is sim- 
ply a tax on real estate, etc., to be paid by all real estate owners, even bachelors. 
This tax is similar to the communal tax in Italy. Tho term ‘school tax” is used 
because the fund is raised for school purposes. But school registration is gratuitous 
in all the States. There is no tax [or fees] for entering on the courses, nor for 
examinations; and more, the city authorities in New York furnish books, pencils, 
and other needed articles to the poorer pupils, spending considerable amounts for 
thesame. * * * 
Elementary education in New York State is obligatory, by law of 1875, for all 
children of 8 to 14 years of age, but in order that this law may not be a dead letter 
on the statute books (as it is often in Italy) 12 agents (truant officers) are paid 
expressly for the purpose of watching for children who are inclined to shirk school 
privileges, and to so notify their parents. If the child is incorrigible he can be 
sent to a reformatory. 
In order to thoroughly understand pablic instruction in the United States it is 
necessary to state that, while the public schools represent a great factor in education, 
private institutions also add their quota to the cause. Among these private insti- 
tutions are many aided by societies; those for orphans, provided for by the Chil- 
dren’s Aid Society, some of which have special funds; others receive subsidies from 
and are under supervision of the municipality. In Leonard street I visited three 
Italian schools maintained by the Children’s Aid Society. I found a fine four-story 
building made of stone and brick and situated near the Five Points district. This 
district is peopled by many of the Italian emigrants, and squalor and misery reach their 
very doors. Established in 1856, this school consisted of 40 pupils gathered together 
ina basement; itnow has 700pupils and is opened day and evening to children of both 
sexes between the ages of 5 and 15 years. In the evening adults receive instruction. 
The attendance is quite regular, except in the spring time, when many are obliged to
-P-A-G-E-630
  620 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
go away from New York to work. During the winter a midday lunch is given to the 
pupils and also garments, if needed. The society provides for newsboys or other 
youths who have no place to sleep. The programme includes studies from that of 
an infant school and a primary course to instruction in printing, domestic economy. 
(cooking and sewing), while the elements of politics enter into the course in a study 
of the Constitution, and the pupils are taught to speak and write English. One of 
the teachers, an Italian, informed me that many Italians who hold excellent posi- 
tions and are much respected were originally instructed in this scheol. This prac- 
tical charity is entirely a work of Americans, and is so nonsectarian in character 
that many of the emigrants had images of the Virgin and of the Saints in the class 
rooms. Of the other two evening schools, one has 300 pupils from the Neapolitan 
provinces, and from all these schools the children are sent annually, if they need it, 
to rural districts or to the seaside for recuperation. 
The schools of New York are open to colored and white pupils, who are educated 
together, and the former seemed as well behaved as the white children. Instruction 
is given in evening schools to more than 20,000 persons who are at work during the 
day. While there is often irregularity of attendance, the pupils seem to appreciate 
being taught. 
Free lectures on hygiene, physiology, natural sciences, geography, description and 
travel, history, literature, and social science are given annually under the auspices 
of the board of education. The 200 to 300 lectures are given in half a dozen of the 
grammar schools on Mondays and Thursdays, in the evening hours, and were it not 
that it would lengthen this article too much I would like to give a résumé of some 
of the lectures, which in 1892-93 were listened to by 130,830 hearers. * * * 
In regard to teachers’ salaries I desire to correct the erroneous impression which 
is entertained by many, that on account of cost of living in America a dollar may 
be reckoned as an equivalent for a lira (19.3 cents) in Italy. This is not true, for 
meat, bread, fish, sugar, coffee, etc., in fact the daily necessaries, are no higher, in 
proportion, in New York than in Italy. However, certain luxuries are more expen- 
sive. House rentals are not so much greater for the people who are not obliged to 
live in the centers of business in American cities; these rentals and lodgings average 
the same as equivalent rentals in Italy. The salaries of teachers permit them, how- 
ever, to pay out for their own improvement (such as the buying of books, subserib- 
ing for periodicals, trips to teachers’ associations, etc.) more than could be done in 
Italy. 
IMPRESSIONS OF SCHOOL EXHIBITS IN CHICAGO. 
The grand educational division of the Exposition at Chicago thoroughly con- 
firmed the impressions of school life in New York, Here at the Exposition one could 
learn much of the rivalry concerning schools, methods, progress, and the sacrificos 
made to bring about such advance in all the States of the Union. This noble rivalry 
merited profound study from its psychological aspect, if it were oniy to discover 
the methods of this wonderful nation. I did not linger in the educational exhibits 
from Massachusetts and Illinois, two States which, as regards education, rival New 
York, but in those from the far West, which only about thirty years ago was like a 
desert entombed in prehistoric times, the eloquent result of whose progress furnishes 
one of the most characteristic presentations offered in the Exposition. The oldest of 
the far Western States is California, which may well be pleased with the statistics 
presented. * * * The most important city in California, San Francisco, is reputed 
to have one of the most perfect systems of public schools, and it does not hesitate 
to consider itself a rival of the older cities, New York or Boston. 
To pass to a State newer in pointof development. New Mexico reports as follows 
in regard to its progress; the statement is modest in quality, but no less noticeable 
for the spirit and method displayed: By law of February 11, 1891, public schools 
were established, and a school tax for the construction of school buildings was 
authorized. From that date to December 31, 1892, there were 532 schools established,
-P-A-G-E-631
  
  EUROPEAN COMMENTS ON AMERICAN EDUCATION. 621 
557 teachers employed, 28,291 pupils enrolled, and an average daily attendance of 
23,151. 
It is well to say here that all the States presented educational information in the 
form of reports and diagrams or tables. Sometimes these last were printed on 
leather, with gilt figures. The American people, who are parsimonious in their 
bureaucratic expenditures, are very lavish, with an almost patriarchal tendency, in 
their expenditures for schools and schooling. There were frequently pictures and 
photographs of pupils taken during the lessons. Numerous were the photographie 
reproductions of school buildings, of the internal arrangements, of the grounds, of 
the picturesque localities in which the schools are situated. The newer States, that 
is, those which have most lately come into the Union, seemed to vie with each other 
in their efforts to make a fine school exhibit. Among the most noticeable exhibits, 
in point of externals, was that of Colorado. * * * Most noticeable was the 
earnestness of purpose manifested in presenting a facsimile of the first schools estab- 
lished in the Territory, with a portrait of their founder and principal, and of the 
best-known teachers. To thus furnish a record of the humble origin of the schools 
in one of the last States to enter the Union surely indicated an intention of doing 
all that is possible to place it on a level with the older States. Colorado, with 
412,000 inhabitants, has 65,490 pupils enrolled in its public schools and 7,072 in the 
privateschools. * * * This State has founded a magnificent normal school which 
indicates the serious intention of those who established schools to provide the best- 
trained teachers for them. 
North Dakota interested me exceedingly. Its school exhibit had over the entrance, 
“North Dakota has 3,000,000 acres of fertile schcollands.” Various laws of the Fed- 
eral Government have been the means of bringing benefactions in the shape of school 
lands; colonization and increasing value of such lands produce a school patrimony 
which the different States make use of for their schools. * * * This State has 
two normal schools for the instruction of teachers, and in the exhibit it was 
noticed that the State had made use of the best that progressive pedagogical methods 
could suggest. For example, I noticed the application and use of drawing or illus- 
tration as a means of assistance in all lines of pedagogical endeavor. Glancing at 
a synopsis of Greek history, I found upon the first page a drawing of three columns 
with both shafts and capitals. These were not made for the mere presentation of a 
drawing, but to record an idea, These columns represented the three styles, Doric, 
Ionian, and Corinthian, and here, even before the children learned aught of their 
history, were three simple presentations indicative of the art and culture of the 
Greek people thoroughly impressed upon the minds of the pupils, and in a manner 
which they will never forget. They may become bankers, commercial men, clerks, 
dealers in pork, sailors, or agriculturists, and yet they will never fail to recognize 
nor even become embarrassed before any representation of Hellenic art, the nation- 
ality and style having already been brought clearly before them. What a number 
of useful things are recorded, as it were, from the association of ideas brought about 
by the grace and simplicity of the three columns drawn before commencing the 
work of a synopsis connected with school work. 
A few pages further on was a map on which the rivers and mountains, and the 
various subdivisions were left unnamed and bore simply numbers which were 
explained at the close of the page. Still another chance for reflection! Not a word 
of geography to indicate what was intended, but simply blanks for the children to 
fill in or by word of mouth to indicate to the teacher the various places, mountains, 
rivers, etc. 
The school exhibit from Minnesota was especially fine, particularly that devoted 
to St. Paul, which is cited as a model. Here was introduced a plan of throwing the 
object to be exhibited upon _a screen by means of the magic lantern, Thus the 
pupils were trained to observe the correct coloring of landscapes, costumes, and 
general subjects, while the instructor gave explanations which made the subjects of 
   
-P-A-G-E-632
622 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  history, geography, etc., most clear to the pupils. In the normal and practice 
schools of Trenton, N. J., the geographical exercises were most noticeable; but some 
of the subjects under discussion in the normal schools will be spoken of elsewhere. 
The study of botany was most practical; the text-books used (Apgar’s New Plant 
Analysis), after giving the requisite terminology and the general classification, pre- 
sented a number of pages, partly blank and partly printed, which were to be filled 
in by the pupils after the plants were properly analyzed. The text consisted of 
the most simple explanations when compared with the complicated presentations 
in our [Italian] text-books. This can be thoroughly understood when one learns 
that the American school is founded essentially upon the instruction given orally 
by the teacher, who thus cooperates with the pupils in all grades from the lowest 
to the highest. In addition to this, the pupils have blank books in which they draw 
well-known plants and flowers from nature. * * ~ 
Istudied at some length the object lesson and the methods employed in normal 
schools, so as to become thoroughly imbued with the system and spirit dominating 
in these important institutions, the graduates from which to become teachers in 
primary and grammar schools—that is, in the people’s schools of the United States. 
The woman teacher commences always with a drawing, if she has a special object to 
present to her pupils. Thus, at the same time that she is explaining the lesson she 
brings before the pupil an illustration placed on the blackboard, which illustration 
serves to conduct the pupil by degrees through the intricacies of quantity, space, 
and time (i. e., in arithmetic, geography, and history), if she is conducting a special 
lesson in these subjects. Similar lessons actually take place in the practice schools 
connected with the normal schools; the pupil teachers point out the observations 
which they have made during the lessons, and it is curious to observe in these com- 
positions or synopses what caused the greatest embarrassment and difficulty to the 
pupil students. Observations and questions put to the teachers are also included in 
these books. The teaching is Socratic and experimental. 
In a volume of compositions I read three concerning a ‘Comparison of the local 
government in New England and Virginia,” and, as a result of my curiosity, I am 
firmly impressed with the fact that the Americans are thoroughly persuaded of the 
superiority of their local government. As additions to the history lessons there are 
pictures of the house of William ?enn,in Philadelphia (if he is the subject under 
study), or of General McClellan (if the campaign of the James River is under dis- 
cussion), united to topographical illustrations of the principal events of that cam- 
paign. This method of illustrating the subject under study is universal in America. 
- In the same school volumes of art pictures were displayed * * * which 
contained reproductions of the most celebrated painters, Michael Angelo, Raphael, 
Giotto, Rubens, and of the most distinguished sculptors. This seemed to me a most 
excellent idea from the educational standpoint, because such a collection served to 
inculcate knowledge, to train the eye, and to contribute to form good taste. * * * 
Asa continuance of this there were historical scenes and pictures of persons, the 
dates alone being given. The physiognomy and the general type are supposed to. 
be enough to indicate who the personages are. Even upon the base of the public 
monuments erected to statesmen or generals of the Union it was rare to have the 
names given. As specimens of graphic art, I was not favorably impressed—in fact, 
I was amused at first, for it seemed to me that this was intended as a joke to pass 
away the time, and that as scholastic work it was lacking in historic precision and 
esthetic taste. But when I came to reflect upon this matter, and when I recognized 
that this was not the result of a teacher’s hobby, then I began to understand the 
general underlying principle, and that the intention was not to make an art study, 
but that the exercises had an entirely different scope. To-day in America, drawing 
for the purpose of illustration is an indispensable part of instruction. 
The study of fine arts as such is very different from the drawing or illustration 
which becomes, as it were, the basis of universal elementary pedagogy. In this our
-P-A-G-E-633
EUROPEAN COMMENTS ON AMERICAN EDUCATION. 623 
inferiority appears, for, prond inheritors of classic civilization, we regard drawing 
as a means of illustration, to be an art reserved for only a few vocations, and we 
only recognize instruction in it as an immediate end toward some professional, 
industrial, or esthetic occupation. But in the American schools drawing has the 
same value-as the alphabet or writing, and as all pupils, even if they donot wish to 
follow a literary profession, must know how to use alphabetical characters in order 
to signify their ideas, so they must know how to use that other universal language, 
drawing, as a means of expression. This is the reason, then, that from the kinder- 
garten upward all children have to draw in the simplest manner such objects as sur- 
round them, domestic animals, flowers, machinery, buildings, maps, the plan ‘of a 
city, portraits of eminent men, artists, and patriots. It is not of so much impor- 
tance whether the drawings are well done, whether they are done by pencil or 
crayon; the main object is that they serve to make an impression on the mind. 
Thus, like the alphabet in its conditions, they form a language of which all can 
make use. It is easy to comprehend that with these sketches, made as an aid to the 
study of geography, history, natural sciences, the Americans, following out a child- 
like instinct, succeed in diverting themselves by illustrations, so that the school is 
not only advantageous from this standpoint, but has its amusing side. By means of 
this method the images or representations of men, facts, deeds, ete., are impressed 
upon the memory so that they will never be forgotten. And as all things are linked 
together in this fashionable and working world of America, so, after having investi- 
gated many school documents, I was not surprised to find at the World’s Fair every 
day, especially in October, girls and boys, both morning and evening, drawing in 
their copy books representations of whatever they saw which interested them most, 
and which they wished to retain in the memory. Naturally, this universal appli- 
cation of drawing has special tendency toward the schools of arts and trades, but 
to enter upon a discussion of that branch would extend this essay to an undesirable 
length. “ * * 
Liberty and variety! Thus may be described the pictures, drawings, etc., on the 
walls of the technical schools—figures, animals, landscapes, copies of other pictures, 
all free-hand work. Nothing conventional! No drawing which had not been 
brought before the senses, which was not a reality to the pupil. Such is the char- 
acter of the American school in divers forms of instruction. The themes given for 
discussion in the high and normal schools seem to me to follow the same general 
trend. Real live topics are given. I write down a few: “The crisis in France,” 
which strange title induced me to read two or three compositions to see whether 
“the Panama scandal” or some other subject had been discussed by these pupils of 
15 to 18 years of age. There was no attempt at rhetorical effect, but simply a col- 
lection of facts, which immediately led me to wonder whether the students had 
read journals and reviews on these subjects, or whether they had closely watched 
the politicians of tho country of which they were writing. As for the comments 
made, they attributed the facts of the Panama scheme to the excess of confidence 
which the people had in Ferdinand de Lesseps, and to the fact that a privileged few 
(privilegi) had control of that undertaking. Tho impression made upon me was 
almost puritanical in its monitions, for it implied that there must be no deviation 
from the severity of the laws toward any citizen. Other subjects discussed were: 
“The banking question,” ‘Should the World’s Fair be opened on the Sabbath?” 
“The silver question.” These live questions, treating of the politics of the day, of 
the functions of public officials, were discussed in the public schools, .and were a 
part of thesystem of that education which forms the youth to be a citizen and pre- 
pares him for practical life. How different that is from the passive, conventional, 
traditional, and bureaucratic type of our [Italian] schools, where the individuality 
of both pupil and teacher is held in abeyance. 
There are many other observations which I would like to jot down, in order to 
demonstrate the liberty accorded to the teacher in the American school, and to

point out the progress and efficiency attained by the methods employed in the Amer- 
ican school. But the system is so different from the Italian system that it is diffi- 
cult to present the subject in a few words. I shall be glad if these few notes bo the 
means of inducing others, mere competent than myself, to make a profound study 
of the society and institutions of that young continent, which in so many partic- 
ulars has already to-day placed itself in advance of the older European civilization. 
OBSERVATIONS CONCERNING AMERICAN EDUCATION, 
By Dr. E. OsrerBerG (of Sweden). 
The observations recorded in the following pages were made on a trip to America 
during the summer of 1893. Dr. N. G. W. Lagerstedt and myself were commissioned 
to examine the educational section of the great exhibits at the World’s Fair in 
Chicago, and to take part in the pedagogical congresses. 
. Dr. Lagerstedt has given an account in this journal! of these congresses, so that I 
limit my remarks on that subject. The discussions in these congresses proved that 
there is a great deal of vitality and interest kept up among American teachers, and 
that pedagogical questions are generally and earnestly studied. I may also mention 
that American women took a very prominent part in the discussions of the con- 
gresses, a natural feature, since the teachers of the United States are largely women, 
who are recognized as teachers even in higher schools and universities.. Some of 
the most impressive discussions, especially those relating to moral instruction in 
schools and coeducation, were conducted by women. Another noticeable trait is 
the harmony apparently existing among the teachers, without regard to the higher 
or inferior positions occupied in the school. The congresses took into consideration 
all the various stages relating to instruction, from the kindergarten to the univer- 
sity, and the separate departments conferred with one another through their 
respective representatives of higher and lower instruction. The questions predomi- 
nating inthe daily programme of the pedagogical discussions were those relating 
to the training of teachers; to promotions from the high school to the universities; 
to the importance of the classical languages; to coeducation in colleges and in the 
universities proper. In the schools which correspond to our people’s schools and 
in the higher grades of common schools (allmiinna liiroverk) coeducation is defi- 
nitely settled and not further discussed. Moral education of the young and, finally, 
the best mode of bringing the law on obligatory attendance into full effect were 
also discussed. 
The division of the World’s Fair devoted to instruction and education was princi- 
pally placed in the Manufactures and Liberal Arts Building. In this immense 
building the larger part of the gallery was assigned to educational exhibits. Some 
of the American States, like Ilinois and Washington, had noteworthy educational 
exhibits in their own State buildings; and in the Woman’s Building education and 
instruction occupied a prominent place. 
Several European countries had material of exceptional value. Even far-distant 
Japan and Brazil made themselves felt in the field of education. In the department 
of Brazil my attention was attracted by a very fair collection of work from manual 
training schools, according to the methods employed at Niiiis. The exhibits of 
France, Russia, Germany, and the United States, however, were the most noteworthy. 
Germany had a very complete and well-arranged exhibit of its school system, from 
the people’s schools to the university. Here one saw an abundance of material for 
instruction in natural sciences, geography, and history; collections of educational 
programmes and text-books, pupils’ work in manual training, etc. Elaborate accounts 
of the German educational system, which had been prepared for the Chicago Expo- 
sition, were distributed in print.    
          
1 Reprint from Verdandi, 1894.
-P-A-G-E-635
          EUROPEAN COMMENTS ON AMERICAN EDUCATION. 625 
The United States exhibits were also very imposing. Nearly every State had a 
spacious section in which were found neatly arranged specimens of pupils’ work in| 
all the various educational branches, with an abundance of reading matter, of 
feminine handiwork, manual training work in wood and metal, from the lowest to 
the highest stage of instruction. As a distinctive feature we mention that several 
schools (those of Omaha, Nebr.) reproduced their school songs by means of phono- 
_ graphs. Even the universities were represented by scientific work furnished by 
their teachers and post-graduate students; also by accounts of their work and by 
photographs of their buildings, study halls, collections, ete. 
The States further distinguished themselves by their very excellent literature, 
. mostly prepared for the occasion in the form of annual reports. These publications 
contained numerous engravings of the study halls, the appliances and material for 
instruction, etc. They also included reports of school inspectors, which reports 
often extended into pedagogical dissertations. The plan laid out for my journey 
included the study of the methods of instruction in American schools, Unfortu- 
nately I arrived too late for this purpose. In Boston and in Harvard University, 
however, I had a chance of attending some closing exercises. To judge by a few of 
my observations, I think that America has developed methods that well deserve a 
closer examination. An extended and thorough study would be very instructive, 
especially in regard to instruction in the mother tongue, also in geography, history, 
and political science, citizenship being connected with this as well as ethics, 
It is natural that the schools of so many States should differ greatly in respect to 
quality and organization. However, the general trend of their development shows 
that they approach the system of the Northeastern States more and more. Here 
schools of dissimilar standing and organization have sprung up, which at the present 
time form a more or less complete system. As an example I cite the school system 
of Boston.. We find there kindergartens, primary and grammar schools for children 
up to 14 years of age, and high schools with four classes for the ages from 14 to 18 
years. Next above these are colleges and universities. 
I wish first to call attention to the gradual extension of kindergarten work all over 
America. The sessions of the congresses devoted to the kindergarten system were 
attended by large audiences, and the work furnished by the little ones occupied a 
prominent place in the exhibits of the separate States. Daily lessons were given at 
different places in kindergartens in operation within the World’s Fair grounds, and 
these attracted the greatest interest from both children and adults. I have observed 
the same facts in England, where the kindergartens are highly appreciated. With 
us in Sweden a certain prejudice against kindergartens exists. This may be because 
this method is easily carried to extremes, and a groundless prejudice against ‘‘Ger- 
manism” prevails. But itis evident that in education there are no leaps; education 
should commence in infancy, should be well regulated for each age, and, in a well- 
managed kindergarten, training for the little ones should be obtained. How many 
parents understand how to carry on this training, even if they are willing and can 
devote their time to it? And how much could be done at an early age for the pur- 
pose of developing the talents of a child? 
“Take the child into the kindergarten and there begin the work of physical, 
mental, and moral training. Put the child in possession of his powers; develop his 
faculties; unfold his moral nature; cultivate mechanical skill in the use of his 
hands; give him a sense of symmetry and harmony; a quick judgment of numbers, 
measure, and size; stimulate his inventive faculties; make hinr familiar with the 
customs and usages of well-ordered lives; teach him to be kind, courteous, helpful, 
and unselfish; inspire him to love whatsoever things are true and pure and right 
and kind and noble.” Supt. J. L. Pickard, from whose book, School Supervision, I 
haye taken these citations, says: “‘The importance of this preliminary work can 
not be overestimated, nor should the State depend upon private contributions for 
so necessary a work.” In New York and Boston the kindergartens are incorpor- 
ED 93——40   
       
-P-A-G-E-636
626 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  ated in the public school system, and this will soon be the case in most of the States. 
r There are numerous private kindergartens in operation everywhere. 
Before I report my observations relating to the instruction in other grades I will! 
call attention to the inferences under which it is conducted. The schools I visited 
in Boston, for example, made a very pleasing impression by their airy and light 
architecture. This impression was not lessened after having inspected the interior 
of the buildings. Statues and mural tablets decorated the corridors, stairways, and 
study halls. When visiting an American schoolroom, decorated with mural tablets, 
photographs, large charts, wall pictures, and bookcases, I found myself desiring to 
become a student. According tomy idea, these pleasant surroundings must produce 
a very beneficial influence upon the schoolboy. It may be said that he becomes so 
used to these pictures, etc., that they no longer attract his attention. But why then 
do we decorate our homes and endeavor to give them a cozy appearance? The 
artistic impression produced upon the mind and soul of the children at school and 
at home by these externals is by no means insignificant. 
One excellent feature in the American mode of instruction seems to be the 
endeavor to make it as illustrative as possible. The blackboard is much used, and 
in the schools I visited in Boston the walls were supplied with blackboards all the 
way around the room. I have frequently observed the same feature in England — 
(also in the new elementary schools of Stockholm). But the work of the school 
children at the Fair showed that the pupils are taught and encouraged to repro- 
duce their ideas at an early age by means of drawings. This is especially noticeable 
in the teaching of natural history and geography, and in teaching history and the 
mother tongue. I have seen maps drawn and colored by pupils of all ages, from the 
first attempt of children 8 to 10 years old to the artistically finished production 
furnished by the higher classes. It was a delight to see the charts prepared by 
pupils of the Cook County Normal School. Many of these maps, made by pupils of 
the lowest grades, doubtless gave great pleasure to those who prepared them, 
Grain, spices, pieces of iron, charcoal, cotton balls, ete., had been used to indicate 
the various products of the States or Territories. This kind of work is supposed 
to inspire the child with special interest and to awaken his self-activity. In addi- - 
tion to physical and geographical charts, there were others indicating the products 
of the different countries; also maps and globes with light outlines to be filled out 
and completed with chalk. Excellent stereoscopic pictures were also exhibited. 
The text-books are good and instructive, especially those in geography, with their 
excellent pictures and maps. My attention was called to a kind of historical chart 
(Linton’s Historical Chart). Instead of the usually dry and dreary aspect of 
= chronological wall tablets, these seem to invite the pupils to make investigations 
and inquiries, and are of great help in memorizing. The history of the world was 
represented by pictures in chronological order upon large wall tablets. To illustrate 
the middle of the eighteenth century, for example, Clive in India, Franklin with a 
lightning rod, the journey of the youthful Washington to the French forts in North 
America, etc., were represented. One can well imagine how the interest and atten- 
tion is increased in a class where such resources of instruction are drawn upon. It 
hardly need to be mentioned that exceedingly fine charts and pictures of all kinds 
for instruction in history, geography, and natural history were exibited in the 
German section. 
Another feature to be pointed out is the diligent application of pen and paper at 
the examinations in all school studies. To be able to express one’s self correctly, 
both orally and in writing, is considered to be a very important feature. Each pupil 
is led in this manner to think out the problem to be treated, and his answer will be 
more accurate than if left entirely to the method of oral instruction. Written 
answers are required, not only at the examinations and for promotions, but time 
periods are set apart for this exercise even during ordinary lessons. In this manner 
the lesson does not remain one incessant examination or recitation. The written
-P-A-G-E-637
EUROPEAN COMMENTS ON AMERICAN EDUCATION. 627 
answers give more accurate knowledge of the conception of the teacher’s oral com- 
munications and at the same time require pupils to furnish independent and indi- 
vidual work. Complaints are made that the teacher’s work is greatly increased by 
the necessity of correcting all these written lessons. As answer to this it is stated 
that the teacher does not correct the work of each pupil, but certain answers are 
selected and discussed before the whole class. No stress seems to be laid upon the 
correction of each separate mistake in the written exercises. Each copy book is not 
required to be treated like a proof sheet ready for the printer. The exercises are the 
means by which the pupil develops his faculty of self-activity, the means to find out 
the standpoint of the pupil and of the class, amirror, as it were, in which the teacher 
sees the shortcomings or merits of his own work reflected. 
Itis quite natural that these exercises should have a favorable influence on the 
versatility of the pupil in using the mother tongue. This brings me to the subject of 
instruction in the mother tongue in American schools, From the conversations I had 
with teachers, from the text-books I read, and from the written exercises of the 
pupils, I learn that Americans ‘are wide-awake in realizing the immeasurable impor- 
tance of education in this line. I observe that children, even in the lowest class, 
are given short compositions, so that they may make instant use of the little they 
have learned. It is, indeed, a great science to conduct instruction in this manner. 
Yet this science they try to develop in America. Some simple opinions are formed 
at an early age; short descriptions of a few lines on daily topics are made, and later 
these topics are discussed before the class. A letter is dictated, and the child itself 
writes the answer to it. An advertisement is read and the pupils answer it; or are 
told to write an advertisement; for example, to recover what they pretend to have 
lost. A picture is shown and the pupils state their view of the subject represented 
by the picture; or, if more advanced, they prepare an argument of what may have 
happened before or after the period of the scene given. In the copy books of the 
older pupils I noticed a secretary’s book of minutes of a board meeting, ete. The 
questions of the day are diligently discussed. ‘The bad streets of Baltimore,” 
“Compulsory education,” ‘“‘The Hawaiian question,” ‘‘Should the World’s Fair be 
opened on Sunday,” were some of the topics treated in the composition books of 
the highest classes. I am not able at present to go into further details of this 
question, but will add that a study of American text-books in regard to the native 
tongue would certainly offer many suggestions to our teachers. * * * 
The number of lessors devoted to the mother tongue differs considerably, but as a 
rule itseems that a great many hours are devoted to this branch, even in the higher 
grades. In the Boston high school, for example, the English language is studied 
during the larger part of the year four hours a week in the two lower classes, and 
three hours in the two higher classes (third and fourth year). It must be observed 
that in the fourth class, which has very few regular studies, English literature takes 
an important place among the optional studies, and thus language receives two 
hours more during the week. It is very evident that the reading of literature is 
encouraged. In the schools I visited each class had a separate bookcase, a hand- 
some ornament in the study hall. The book collection, consisting of selected litera- 
ture and adapted to the age of the class, is in care of the class teacher. Reference 
books for the use of teachers are also found there, The subjects treated in the com- 
positions bear witness that the books are really read. ‘‘ What I have learned from 
Ruskin,” “A half hour with Wordsworth,” and similar topics, seemed to have been 
handled by preference. The pupils also acquired great versatility in oral rendition. 
It was a pleasure to listen to the young girls and boys at the examinations in Bos- 
ton, which, as I mentioned before, I had an opportunity of attending. We have © 
frequently heard of the independent manners of Englishmen and Americans in 
public life, and I had fair opportunities of observing this fact. No matter if the 
subject discussed referred to “The refraction of light,” or “The structure of the 
dactylic hexameter verse,” or ‘‘ The character of Aineas as exhibited in the first six

books of the Aineid,” or a “ Secretary’s report of ‘an English recitation,” one was 
always agreeably attracted by the free and easy manner with which the subject was 
discussed, the speaker being aided by only a few notes. This universal faculty of 
unaffected and correct expression I observed frequently at the congresses in Chicago. 
Speaking of instruction in the mother tongue recalls some observations made 
while studying the German compositions of graduating students (Abiturienten) as 
séen in the German exhibit at Chicago. In our country, says Dr. Osterberg, I have 
frequently heard pupils, parents, and teachers express their uneasiness when the 
graduating compositions had to be written. This uneasiness does not originate from 
a doubt of the pupil’s ability to use the mother tongue correctly or to arrange the 
compositions logically, but from fear that the subject may be of such a nature that 
the pupil is not sufficiently familiar with it. To be sure, these topics are selected 
from the material which the pupil has gone over during his school years, yet a long 
time may have elapsed since he heard or read anything relating to the subject, and 
it may happen that these very points were never treated thoroughly enough to give 
him any essential facts to write about. It is not easy to write when material is 
wanting, hence these compositions often display loose and unsatisfactory arguments 
and are wanting in style. In Germany the teacher reads off three subjects, which 
he knows the pupils to have mastered, and then a higher authority determines the 
subject to be given (another topic may be selected, if necessary). In the proceedings 
of the “‘Abiturienten” examinations in Breslau, for example, the teacher announces 
that Goethe’s ‘‘ Iphigenia” has been read, and proposes the following themes: ‘“ What 
ideas do the prayers of Iphigenia, addressed to the Gods, convey of her character?” 
“(4 noble man is greatly influenced by a woman’s good word. How is this proved 
by Thoas?” ‘In what manner does Pylades show himself a special friend in the 
hour of distress?” The first of these was chosen. The compositions indicated 
thoroughness and ease of treatment, which might be expected from thorough knowl- 
edge of the subject. In England and America the pupil sometimes knows, several 
years in advance, on what authors and works or on what period in history the ques- 
tions willtouch, * * * 
These requirements prove that studies in the native literature are promoted. I 
have observed that, as arule, the educated classes in England and America have a 
more thorough knowledge of their own country’s authors and their work than we 
find in Sweden in the same circles. Undoubtedly the interest with which libraries 
and the science of collecting books and arranging libraries are fostered in America 
may be one cause of this. Public libraries, and reading rooms connected with them, 
are considered almost indispensable in every advanced American community. It is 
not so well known that several schools have been founded and that departments in 
colleges have been established to disseminate a knowledge of library work and to 
give pupils an idea of the practical side of library questions. These schools have 
organized the exchange of books and made them accessible to the public in a most 
practical manner. * * * 
But more is needed than the mere establishment of libraries; one should also 
stimulate a desire for reading and a taste for the pure enjoyment found in consult- 
ing good books, and I have reason to think that this will be brought about by school 
instruction. The possibility of calling forth a love for reading and the literature of 
the fatherland exists already in the fact that the mother tongue occupies so impor- 
tant a place on the school programme and in the methods employed. It must be 
remembered that the programme includes a small number of studies, and that the 
school does not take up all the time of the pupils. The first section of the Boston 
high-school regulations reads: ‘‘The school hours shall be five each day, five days    
‘a week.” Of these, four hours for recitation and for study are set apart for the 
pupil’s individual work. Twelve hours a week are assigned for home work. Under 
such conditions the pupil has leisure to take interest in a more thorough study of 
the master works of the literature of his native country.

EUROPEAN COMMENTS ON AMERICAN EDUCATION. — 629 
  A question that greatly occupies the pedagogical world of the United States is 
that of the training of teachers. In a country where such numerous changes take 
place among teachers, and where new schools are constantly erected in large num- 
bers, this must be a very difficult problem. But the difficulties stand out clearly ~ 
before their eyes, and they struggle with all their might to conquer them. Some of 
the teachers are trained in the so-called normal schools; but these can not supply 
the schools with the requisite number of new teachers. Most of the normal schools 
seem to rank with the high schools, but the instruction is given with special con- 
sideration for the student’s future occupation as a teacher, and courses in pedagogy 
are given also. In this manner, however, only kindergarten, primary, and grammar 
school teachers can be obtained. Teachers of the high school, who usually pass 
through a college course, or take a degree-at a university, rarely have a pedagogical 
training. To accomplish this, however, is the desire of America and England, where 
at this moment Jively discussions are carried on in regard to ‘‘secondary education” 
and the training of teachers for secondary schools. This discussion was brought 
about by a bill that had previously been considered in Congress. In the meantime, 
and this I wish to bring chiefly before the public, the study of method in education 
and instruction is encouraged in every part of the United States, and pedagogy is by 
no means disdained. Some of the normal schools seem to have raised their standard 
far above others, and comprise among their students persons who have even passed 
a university examination. The State Normal School of Michigan, for example, 
grants degrees in pedagogy. The degrees of bachelor of pedagogy and master of 
pedagogy are granted to students who, after a complete course at a normal school, 
or examination for admission to a university, devote cne or two years more to peda- 
gogical studies and write a treatise on that subject. Several universitiés have 
separate chairs for pedagogy. * * * That the teachers of America were well 
versed in the theory of pedagogy and history could be observed at the deliberations 
of the international congress. An English woman, a teacher, who during the sum- 
mer took part in the congresses, mentions an utterance made by an American teacher 
in one of the section meetings: ‘‘ We all acknowledge a certain philosophical sys- 
tem underlying all education. How many English teachers,” she added, ‘‘are famil- 
iar with philosophy of teaching?” And we Swedes may well have reason to ask 
the same question. { : 
The difficulty of obtaining efficient and well-trained teachers has brought about 
the natural result that school supervision plays an important réle in the United - 
States, especially the so-called State supervision, which is carried on by one inspector 
in each State for all schools. School superintendents like Horace Mann, Henry~ 
Barnard, and William T. Harris have had unprecedented influence on the develop- 
ment of the American school system. Since the years 1830 and 1840 they have, as it 
appears, been indefatigable in promoting the interests of education in their own and 
other States, and by advice given to individual teachers, through teachers’ meetings 
and lecture courses, and through their valuable and extensive official reports, they 
have exerted influence upon lawmaking bodies, boards, and councils. 
One institution which originated in this manner is the so-called teachers’ insti- 
Prirges ae 
In connection with these there are reading circles in which certain books are 
studied by each teacher in the course of the year and then later are discussed at 
stated meetings. Summer schools are also held at the normal schools previous.y 
mentioned. * * * Even Harvard College has a summer school forteachers. These 
institutes also include the courses given at Chautauqua, which are connected with 
reading circles during the remainder of the year. The Chautauqua system has given 
.rise to a number of similar institutions all over the Union. As another example of 
how opportunities are offered to teachers to avail themselves of the experience of 
renowned colleagues, I refer to a paragraph of the school statutes in Cleveland, 
according to which opportunities are offered each teacher to visit other schools on 
certain days.
-P-A-G-E-640
    630 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Especially numerous are the pedagogical societies and teachers’ associations. 
These frequently issue publications of their transactions. There are a great many 
pedagogical journals in America and some of them rank very high. The National 
Educational Association, whose proceedings are of great importance, and under 
whose auspices the international congress was held last summer in Chicago, issues 
annually a volume containing a full account of its proceedings. These large volumes 
are a veritable mine of instruction, and offer pedagogical reading matter of no mean 
character. Among American educational writings, the reports of Messrs. Mann, 
Barnard, and Harris, previously mentioned, most assuredly take the lead, as do the 
journals edited by these eminent educators. The valuable publications issued by 
the United States Commissioner of Education should be included. 
To judge from the interest displayed in pedagogy by American teachers, by the 
highest officials of schools and universities, as well as from the importance the public 
bestows upon school education, and the sacrifices made in its behalf, one must 
expect fair progress in future within the province of education. My opinion is that 
a thorough investigation of the United States school system and a profound study 
of the schools in operation would bring to light various instructive details worthy 
of imitation. 
STUDIES ON THE EDUCATIONAL EXHIBITS AT CHICAGO. 
From a report by Dr. N. G. W. Lacerstept, of Stockholm, Sweden. 
(Mr. Lagerstedt was commissioned. by the Swedish government to visit the Exposition, and was 
required to make a report to the department of worship and education. He left Stockholm in June, 
1893, and after visiting the United States Bureau of Education proceeded to Chicago, where he remained 
until the middie of August. He gave particular attention to the educational exhibits, took part in 
the educational congresses, and visited some of the educational institutions in Hlinois and Minnesota. 
In his opinion, the German exhibits were the most important after the American, but other exhibits 
are mentioned. After a short notice the author passes on to a more detailed and minute account of 
American schools. He begins with a brief review of the public school system of the United States, 
and notes the effect of independent management by the various States, but points out the fact that 
there are still certain leading features common to all schools. These features are then discussed, an1 
the schools of Columbus, Ohio, and Tacoma, Wash., taken as characteristic of certain types. He 
finds that the public school system of the United States corresponds to the secondary schools of 
Sweden, but is inferior to them. 
Normal schools are then considered, as is the preparation of teachers and their characteristic weak- 
ness in America. After a few sections devoted tothe United States Bureau of Education, the powers 
and functions of State boards of education and city school boards are considered, The next few pages 
are devoted to American universities and colleges, to the higher education of women, and to expend- 
itures for education. After this general introduction he begins his study of educational questions 
as follows:] 
* * * The largest proportion of the United States school exhibit consisted of 
pupils’ work. This is probably due to the fact that the school children of the United 
States, more than with us, devote their time to work that leaves visible results—to 
productive work. The latter includes short compositions in the mother tongue, 
besides penmanship, written exercises in spelling, arithmetic, drawing, painting, 
manual work, modeling in clay, natural-history collections and other work, map 
drawing, relief maps, kindergarten work, etc. 
The exercises in the mother tongue seem to me especially noteworthy. These 
begin, in Columbus, Ohio, during the latter part of the first year of the primary school 
(pupils of 6 years). The children, for example, fill blanks in sentences, using words 
from a given list. During the second year the pupils express their ideas, first verb- 
ally, then in writing, on some object or action observed. They describe simple 
pictures, and toward the end of the year write short letters or repeat in writing 
subjects that were discussed during lesson hours. In the third year (at first daily) 
written opinions and short compositions on general topics within the comprehension 
of the pupils are required; then further descriptions of animals and plants, and of 
actions, letters of greater length, or narrations with certain words interwoven. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-641
EUROPEAN ‘COMMENTS ON AMERICAN EDUCATION. 631 
regulations for the fourth year prescribe the reproduction of short stories from Amer- 
ican history, read by the teacher; also, descriptions of animals, plants, scenes, etc., 
narratives of journeys, accounts of picnics, etc., and letter writing. At times the 
pupil may choose his own subject and relate things that interest him. For the fifth 
year, or the first of the grammar school (pupil’s age, 10 years), there are prescribed, 
among other things, descriptions of current events, or of more extended trips made by 
the pupil, and compositions on subjects taken from natural history, physiology, the _ 
science of hygiene, or other branches taught in the school, or on general topics of 
interest in city and country. The compositions are furnished in rough copy, and 
after correction are rewritten. This year’s work includes stories from outlines, writ- 
ing from memory, and original work. During the two following years, the sixth and 
seventh, nothing new seems to be added in this line. During tho seventh year a 
written exercise is required once aweek. For the eighth year, short letters, business 
accounts, short historical and biographical sketches, in accordance with given out- 
lines. No separate courses for written work are prescribed for the several classes 
of the high school. 
The foregoing courses show that these written exercises are introduced much 
earlier than with us, As they are continued throughout the whole school course, 
parallel with oral exercises of a similar nature, it is very evident whence proceeds 
the remarkable skill of American school children in writing and speaking their 
mother tongue. 
Furthermore, attention must be called to the practical character of the written 
exercises. Letter writing occupies a prominent place, and careful attention is paid 
to the common rules of heading, closing sentences, and signature, folding of letters, 
and addressing. Special training is observed in drawing up business letters and 
similar composition work. For purposes of a more practical character we may also » 
mention such as describing current events, for example, public festivals, ete. 
One kind of exercise often resorted to is certainly very appropriate; it consists in 
describing a picture. Such exercises are commenced at a very early stage. The 
pupil is given a small colored picture, which is pasted on paper, and then he states 
what it represents. The following may serve as an example;' it was written by a 
little girl 8 years of age: 
“Mary and herlamb. ‘There are a little girl and a lamb in the picture. The lamb 
is jumping through a hoop. There is a boy by the well. There are two trees; I can 
just see their leaves, There is a seat between the trees. There is a boy leaning 
against an old-fashioned well. There isa bucket by the well. There is a rolling 
* stick on the ground. There is an old country fence. There is a house behind the 
fence. I can just see the top of the house. There is a rock near the little girl’s foot. 
I think it is summer, because the little girl has short sleeves. The little girl is 
laughing at the lamb.” 
Writing of this kind was also presented in the French educational exhibit at the 
Chicago Exposition. Among written exercises of pupils many could be found that 
were connected with drawing exercises. A plant, or a part of a plant, an animal 
and certain parts of the same, a physical apparatus, etc., were drawn, frequently 
even colored, and described. Some examples derived from a high school in Pitts- 
burg may be mentioned. A paper with the heading “‘Study of a crab” represented 
this animal, with illustrations of separate parts and descriptions. A sparrow was 
pictured and described in the same manner. Another exercise, ‘The growth of 
maize,” consisted of illustrations, mostly colored, and representing maize in differ- 
ent stages of development from the growing seed to a full-grown plant. In another 
composition a fruit-bearing branch of a cherry tree was seen, illustrated and 
described. Another showed a colored india-rubber leaf of natural size, with descrip- 
tion which read as follows: ‘‘This is the leaf of an india-rubber plant; the princi- 
  
1Not being personally in possession of a copy, I have taken this 'from Buisson, Rapport sur

pal parts are the blade and petiole; the margin is entire. The shape is elliptical, 
the apex is acute, the base obtuse, the surface is smooth, the veins are paralleled 
costal, and the texture leathery.” 
Sometimes, instead of a drawing, a pressed specimen of the plant treated was 
fastened on the paper. In this connection I mention that at examinations the 
answers to the questions are mostly given in writing. To what an extent this is 
done in different cities and places I am not able to say. This method of examina- 
tion has no doubt advantages which are worth considering. The similarity of 
questions addressed to all pupils will cause more correct answers; the questions are 
considered more carefully ; the answer is given with greater composure and caution; 
and the result of the examination depends less on mere chance. This method is 
also carried on in England to a large extent, from the lowest classes of the school to 
the university and governmental examinations. My opinion is that this method of 
examining deserves to be introduced in our schools to acertain extent. It certainly 
would be practical in the higher classes of our secondary schools in connection with 
oral exercises in mathematics. The experiments which I made when an inspector at 
the normal school for higher grade women teachers brought out the good features of 
this method. First and foremost, it is of great advantage in grading the certifi- 
cates that there should exist a written evidence of the student’s efficiency. In most 
instances it happened that the examination agreed with my previously formed judg- 
ment in regard to the student’s ability. Sometimes, indeed, a student, through the 
accuracy and keenness of her answers, showed herself worthy of a better rating than 
Thad hitherto awarded her. Yet I do not remember any case in which a favorable 
judgment of mine, previously arrived at, was ever set at naught after inspection of 
the written answers. At times, of course, I became assured on one point or another 
where I hitherto had been undecided informing a final judgment. However, to per- 
mit the results of written answers to solely influence the certificates or opinions at 
an examination would be entirely out of place. Oral examinations give the exam- 
iner an opportunity to see the examinee in a different light from that in a written 
examination. It seems best, therefore, to have both kinds, if possible. For that 
purpose one might submit questions for written answers different from those used. 
in the oral examination. For one pupil it may be easier to express himself orally, 
while another pupil is more able to state his ideas in writing. It is no more than 
just that each should be afforded an opportunity to show his ability in the best 
light. It is preferable to make an examination as many sided as possible. With 
this end, one might propose questions differing in nature, so as to bring out the indi- 
viduality of the student in his written answers. Besides, some of the questions may 
require only a brief statement of facts, others a more detailed answer; the latter, 
however, without leading to a composition, which is a question that can not be 
considered here. 
In regard to instruction in drawing and coloring, the schools of the United States 
present some features that are of great interest to us and very instructive. A closer 
study of this branch would be most profitable to a professional teacher. I will pre- 
sent only those sides which attracted my attention most. I have already mentioned 
that a drawing lesson is usually combined with a written composition; the pupil 
must at the same time draw, perhaps color, and describe a subject. This subject is 
generally taken from the study of natural science; for example, a plant, or an animal, 
or a piece of physical apparatus, etc. The teacher tries in this manner to connect 
the instruction of drawing and painting with other school branches. Some work 
sent by the pupils of Grand Rapids, Mich., in colored pictures of leaves or other parts 
of plants, bore the inscription: ‘‘ Our aim is to aid the instruction in botany by in- 
struction in drawing.” Instruction in the natural sciences is of course best adapted 
for combination with that of drawing. Inschools where efforts are made to combine 
these branches the pupils of the lowest grades (from 6 to 7 years of age) begin with 
these drawing and coloring exercises. The children are supplied with paper, color 
 
-P-A-G-E-643
  
ET Ne ee eee eT Tee 
EUROPEAN COMMENTS ON AMERICAN EDUCATION. 633 
box, pencil, etc., and a flower, and then without further preparation they are told to 
paintit. The picture which the child produces is naturally very primitive, but then 
all firstresults are crude, no matter at what kind of handiwork we make our first trial ; 
in fact, the production of something defective and incomplete is a means of practice 
and instruction that will effect better results in future. The child’sskill in coloring 
soon improves and surpasses the expectations of everybody. In the Indianapolis 
schools,! and probably in various other places, the children are kept occupied with 
so-called “silent exercises” in coloring. To the picture they add in writing their 
own thoughts or ideas on the subject represented. Instead of writing they express 
them at times by fastening on the paper a number of loose letters, arranged into a 
sentence. For example, one child wrote under the picture of a buttercup: ‘Come 
again buttercup, where didst thou grow little flower?” Another child, representing 
the leaf of an apple tree, wrote: ‘‘ This is the leaf of an apple tree. This leaf does 
not resemble a geranium leaf, it has the form of an egg.” It is easily understood 
that exercises of this kind tend much more to educate and are more apt to widen the 
perceptive powers, as well as to amuse a child, than if it were forced to write over 
and over again the same words or short sentences.? To give an example of the com-_ 
bining method of drawing and coloring with other branches of study, it may be. 
mentioned that the pupil, naturally at a more advanced stage than that just referred 
to, has to color maps or characteristic landscape pictures; and that they make draw- 
ings of historical events, as the engagement between the Monitor and Merrimac. 
Besides this kind of drawing and painting, however, there should be carried on, 
at all times, a more methodical study of drawing. In this respect the pupil is to a 
large extent kept busy inventing new designs and composing decorative forms, at ~ 
first under the guidance of a teacher and according to certain geometrical motives 
or forms conventionalized from nature. As examples of such forms from nature, I 
saw used oak leaves and acorns, the leaf and flower of a wild rose, leaf of a vine 
branch, blossom and buds of a lilac, an ilex leaf. Some specimens of this kind dis- 
played much taste and inventive talent and were well executed. 
All this refers to fhe mode of teaching in the practice department of Cook County 
Normal School, Chicago. This practical study occupies quite a conspicuous place on 
the programme of the normal school. 
Drawing on a blackboard is used extensively with the general lessons, and the 
teacher must possess greater skill in drawing than is usually the case with us. In 
a school at Moline, Til., near Rock Island, I saw drawings on the blackboard that 
were executed with chalk by one of the teachers and had remained on the board 
from the preceding term. I can only say that they were surprisingly well done and 
indicated a high degree of artistic execution. 
. Modeling in clay is a branch that has been introduced in more recent years and 
has been adopted in a great many schools. In the kindergarten children are set to 
work with it. They first draw and then model some geometrical figures, as a cube, 
globe, pyramid, cylinder, cone, etc., or some other easy figures, as a mug, vase, ete. 
In the Boston schools, where it was first introduced, this subject is taught on a dif- 
ferent plan. A few hours’ instruction of modeling in clay was every day (except on 
Saturdays) given to children during the Exposition in one of the rooms of the 
Children’s Building. The instruction was carried on in conformity with the Boston 
plan. Guided by things I saw and heard, and by a printed paper distributed among 
visitors and explaining methods, I will attempt to give a few particulars on the 
subject in question. The aim of this plan is an educational one ; endeavors are 
made to train the child’s capacity for comprehending and reproducing forms, or, in 
other words, to train his eye and hand. The models are after drawings that have 
been made previously from other models or oral descriptions. The child first forms

  634 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  asquare disk of clay (about 6 inches edge and one-half inch thickness). Upon this 
raised figures are then formed by means of new layers of clay. The contours are 
first traced on the disk and must conform with the drawing on the paper that 
serves as amodel for the work. All patterns for the figures are based upon geometric 
forms. The pupil is sometimes required to personally produce the designs from 
which he models. Pupils from 7 to 12 years old execute in this manner really diffi- 
cult tasks upon the square disks mentioned. Older pupils model separate leaves 
and fruit forms, later animal studies, and finally, parts of the human body. In doing 
this only the distances from the principal points are measured, and the contours are 
drawn by eye measure. Thus the work is commenced, to the execution of which, 
first and foremost, accuracy is requisite, and the modeis are of such a nature that 
the parts can be easily measured by the pupil and later corrected by him from 
measurements. After the eye has been trained to judge and the hand to reproduce 
such forms correctly, some smaller mechanical designs are attempted that make a 
transition to more purely artistic work. 
That the collecting of natural science objects and other things belongs to the reg- 
ular school work of pupils, at least in some places, was shown by the exhibits. 
There were, for example, in the New York State division, herbariums and other col- 
lections furnished by pupils; collections of wood specimens, rocks, fossils, specimens 
of stone and flints. From a high school in Kansas City, Mo., there was a collection 
of about 300 insects, mostly large butterflies, with notes attached saying that nearly 
all these specimens had been prepared in a room specially devoted to natural 
science. From a normal school for women in Wisconsin physical apparatus was 
- exhibited that had been constructed by the students after a pattern which they had 
themselves invented. 
To judge by the exhibits, the making of geographical relief maps is an ordinary 
occurrence. The raised parts are formed by means of putty or a kind of pulp of 
boiled paper. The base consists of a wooden plate, sometimes only of cardboard, 
I wish to lay stress upon the fact that the branches taught in the United States 
schools are designed to awaken productive activity. This aim is not subordinate to 
the regular lessons, but constitutes in fact. the principal part, at least much more 
than with us. Productive work is in our country included in the school programme 
also, to wit, writing, drawing, arithmetic, etc., but the larger amount of .our school 
work consists in lessons being read over by the pupils and later recited at school. 
Besides this, our teachers endeavor to inculcate the pupils with ideas; they convince 
themselves that the pupils have a true understanding and retention of these by their 
answers to queries in recitations. Our pupils’ work, therefore, is preeminently of 
a receptive kind. It is evident that the instruction given in the United States 
schools exacts a many-sided self-activity on the part of the pupil, by way of occu- 
pying him to such a great extent with work which requires productive activity. 
To study lessons and to comprehend and recite the information gained calls forth 
naturally a certain amount of self-activity, but only a one-sided self-activity. It is 
indeed one of the most important problems of good instruction to tax, ina proper man- 
ner, tho pupil’s self-activity, and this it seems to me is done by the work referred to. 
This work is also apt to keep the pupil’s interest awake, a fact which can be easily 
understood. It is also evident that the knowledge acquired in such occupations 
will be better retained by the memory and applied in life. To adopt various kinds 
of such work in our schools would be most decidedly of advantage. This change 
could not be introduced without a corresponding curtailing of courses and lessons, 
but this loss probably would be more than counterbalanced by the advantages gained. 
The practical character of the school work in the United States is plain. The aim 
is to place it, as far as possible, in connection with actual life, during and after 
school. That this, however, by no means need imply an overlooking of the school’s 
aim to act in the service of education is well understood from the above statement. 
Finally, I shall dwell upon the movement and efforts of more recent date throughout

the United States in relation to ‘raising the standard of the teachers’ professional 
training,” and in relation to the progress of the science of pedagogy. The estab-_ 
lishment of chairs of pedagogy at the universities is included in the above scheme. | 
The first chair of this kind in the United States was established in 1879 at the State 
University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor. There is also a chair of pedagogy in Clark 
University, where Dr. G. Stanley Hall performs the functions of a professor of psy- 
chology and pedagogy; another in Leland Stanford Junior University, besides one 
in the State University of Minnesota, at Minneapolis. The last-named chair was 
established in 1293. 
The “school of pedagogy,” founded in the University of New York City in 1890, is 
certainly quite unique inits nature. This faculty holds the same position in the uni- 
versity as the faculties of law, medicine, and philosophy. The faculty of pedagogy 
(it is thus designated on a pamphlet sent to me from there) is founded upon the 
principle that the special training for a teacher’s career should be placed on the same 
level with the training required for other professions. The corps of teachers consists 
of 5 members, a dean, 3 professors, and a lecturer. The faculty grants two degrees, 
the lower, ‘Master of pedagogy” and the higher, ‘“‘Doctor of pedagogy.” To 
secure the latter it is requisite that the candidate be in possession of a certificate 
and have had at least four rs’ successful experience as a teacher; to have pursued 
for at least two years the studies of the higher section of the faculty, and to pass 
a good examination in the following five subjects: (1) History of education and 
instruction; (2) psychology and ethics; (3) pedagogy and methods, including school 
hygiene, etc.; (4) literature of pedagogy and esthetics; (5) the educational systems 
of different countries, besides the writing of a scientific dissertation on pedagogy 
which displays an independent treatment of the subject and bears witness to original 
vesearch. The first graduates of the faculty of pedagogy obtained their degree as 
doctors of pedagogy and masters of pedagogy in 1891; in all, 26. Among the doc- 
tors of pedagogy who have graduated hitherto there are 5 women. During the 
school year 1892-93 the faculty counted about 135 students. The persons who pur- 
sue these studies are principally those who wish to educate themselves to become 
school inspectors, superintendents, professors at normal schools, ete. 
A recent pedagogical movement, of which Dr. G. Stanley Hall is the originator 
and leader, attracts much attention. Its aim is to make the child, in the interésts 
of education, an object of empirical study and to base education and instruction 
more than heretofore upon a true knowledge of the child’s physical and psychical 
nature. Dr. Hall’s journal, The Pedagogical Seminary, may be regarded as the 
organ of this movement. Two volumes have thus far been published. With refer- 
ence to articles in that journal, and to an article by Dr. Hall in The Forum in 1893, a 
few remarks will be added here to point out the work which has been accomplished 
and the aims and endeavors connected with it. 
It should be understood, however, that cfforts in this line are not confined to 
America alone. Tho leading incentive of the movement may lie in the fact that Dr. 
Hall.is both a practical educator and a psychologist, and as such a follower of the 
modern tendency, which, being based on psychology and the method of the exact 
Sciences, endeavors to investigate the activity of the soul. This movement origi- 
nated in Europe, and has there its representatives in Wundt, Fechner, Helmholtz, 
etc. Valuable works on empirical child psychology have beén published in France 
by Compayré and Perez; in Germany by Preyer. Examinations of a large number 
of children in regard to their physical condition and for other purposes have been 
made repeatedly in Europe. Among others,I call attention to the investigations 
made in 1884, ordered by the Swedish school council, and which became known and 
famous through the book edited by Prof. Axel Key. Questions of this kind have at 
present been taken hold of with great zeal by the followers of the American leaders 
in this question. They endeavor to accomplish cooperation among persons who 
study the child from various standpoints—teachers, parents, physicians, psycholo-    
  
        a i i

        636 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
gists. Their principal endeavor is to gain safe ground for a better education and 
instruction. — 
Whatever has been done, though, to advance this study can not be compared with 
what may yet be done. ‘The future of the movement,” Dr. Hall says, ‘‘ depends 
essentially on never-ceasing, laborious work.” 
The study of a child is very far-reaching, according to Dr. Hall’stheory. He divides 
it into four parts, each comprising one of four stages of development: (1) Prenatal 
age; (2) the period from birth to the age of 3 or 4 years; (3) from then until 13 or 
14 years; (4) from the last-named age to 20 or 24 years. Children belonging to the 
third stage, or that comprising the larger portion of the school period, have hitherto 
been the principal object of study and research. 
The usual mode of research consists in examining a large number of children, say 
several thousand, on one and the same point or points. They are measured and 
weighed, their strength is tested by means of dynamometers; their teeth, eyes, lungs, 
nose, throat, hearing, their sense of precision and speed in movements, etc., are exam- 
ined under observance of every precaution to avoid error and to gain a uniformly 
* aceurate result. If it is a question of investigating what a child knows in certain 
lines much tact is required and the cross-questioning is done by experienced and 
competent persons who are fond of children and accustomed to their ways. One 
kind of examination in vogue consists in letting a child write down his thoughts on 
some subject. The child, as has been previously stated, obtains much drill in this 
line, and.even in the lowest classes commits his thoughts to paper. The child even 
_ attempés to draw pictures and to illustrate short narratives read to him beforehand. 
A very simple method of investigation is one that for a number of years has been 
followed by the students of Worcester Normal School, at the instance of the princi- 
pal, E. H. Russel. The students are instructed not tomake fixed observations with- 
out paying the most scrupulous attention to the actions and speech of the child, and 
to write down the facts obtained in this manner. These written notes are kept and 
arranged under appropriate headings, as memory, imagination, anger, imitation, etc. 
At present there are more than 14,000 such notes on file. They touch upon all ques- 
tions of psychology, and the best of them are used in the instruction of this branch 
at the normal school instead of a text-book. The following are examples of notes: 
(1) “While I examined what the child had been writing Carrie asked my permis- 
sion to take her slate home and show the writing to her mother. Immediately 
following, six or seven other children asked permission to do the same.” 
(2). “Charlie, the child under observation, aged 5 years 8 months. One evening 
several chickens had been killed, and Charlie was sent to one of the extreme rooms 
to fetch a chicken that had already been plucked. After a moment’s absence we 
heard him scream as though he were greatly frightened. Somebody ran out to see 
what had happened to him and found him very pale and leaning against a table; in 
the open doorway stood a young, live chicken. After a long time of questioning 
we finally learned the cause of the boy’s. fright. He thought that the chicken he 
had come to fetch had come to life again and was the one standing in the open door. 
Charlie was, as a rule, not afraid of anything.” 
(3) “EB. (5 years), a girl, went out into a rain storm and, without having a hat on, 
placed herself in the middle of the road. The mother: ‘E., come in and do not 
stand out in the rain.’ E.: ‘No; I will remain here until I am soaked, so that I may 
grow and become tall. Ido not want to wear dresses any longer; I want a pair of 
pants.’” 
According to common experience, the instances recited are by no means remark- 
able facts. The future importance of these annotations to educational psychology 
is by no means settled yet, but without doubt they will be of some service. ‘‘ This is 
no science as yet, but without experiments there is no science.”! The gain derived 
from these notes is in one respect immediate. They have proved to be of great help

EUROPEAN COMMENTS ON AMERICAN EDUCATION. 687 
to graduating teachers. They take greater interest in each child, individually, 
insiead of meditating too much on the pedagogical abstraction called the child. 
This study of the child, as it is expressed by some people, is done ‘‘ directly for the 
saxe of the teachers, indirectly for the sake of the child, and has the additional pur- 
pose to benefit science.” | 
Some separate examinations of a large number of children and their results will 
be mentioned here. Professor Bowditch has examined weight and height of 24,500 
pupils in the Boston schools. He found that until 11 or12 years of age the boys were 
taller and heavier than the girls. Later the girls begin to grow more rapidly and 
within a few years they are taller and heavier than the boys. However, the latter 
soon catch up and outgrow the girls. Measurements of about 10,000 children in 
Milwaukee showed that a child grows more rapidly from May to November than dur- 
ing the other part of the year. 
By weighing more than 30,000 children it has been ascertained that children who 
are intellectually developed early are heavier, and lazy children lighter, than other 
children on an average would be at the same age. 
Investigations regarding the eyesight of school children made in Breslau among 
10,000 children and worked out by Dr. Cohn show that the nearsightedness increased 
from grade to grade. Similar investigations by other authorities show the same 
results. Examinations have been made even regarding the hearing of children, and 
it was proved that many children who are not thought deaf nevertheless ossess & 
less acute capacity of hearing, and do not, therefore, profit fully by the oral instrue- 
tion. Such children are considered less talented, while in truth they are deaf to a cer- 
tain degree. In Berlin it has been found that 25 per cent of the children examined 
were more or less afflicted with deafness, and in most cases sufficiently so as to impede 
the progress of their school work. 
The examination of a number of school children in St. Petersburg showed that 
more than 11 per cent suffered with headaches. Among school children in Hamburg 
there were 32 per cent having more or less defective nervous systems; the percent- 
age increased from grade to grade. A comparison of investigations in this line led 
to the conclusion that more than 30 per cent of the school children in Europe have 
defective nervous systems; moreover, that the percentage in the lowest classes was 
almost zero in this respect, but increased to 66 per cent during the last year in a 
classical high school. According to statistical information in Prussia, 289 pupils 
committed suicide within the period of five years, in most instances from causes 
arising in school. 
The question concerning the effects of fatigue has been treated also. A decrease 
in the accuracy with which school children performed their work in-the morning 
was observed in various grades. The decrease amounted to 33 per cent during the 
day, after four or five hours of work. 
Some investigations regarding a child’s intellectual life should also be mentioned. 
The first one ever attempted was made in Berlin in 1869, with the object of ascer- 
taining what knowledge a child possesses of things in general. The result was that 
children showed great ignorance of many things thought to be known by every 
child. Dr. G. Stanley Hall brought about a similar investigation in Boston in 1880, 
A great many children, about 6 years old, who had just entered school, were interro- 
gated as to their knowledge in various respects, The questions were put by tactful 
and experienced persons, usually women teachers. I mention the following results: 
14 per cent of the children had never observed the stars and did not have the least 
conception of them; 35 per cent had never been in the country; 20 per cent did 
not know that the milk comes from cows; 25 per cent that wooden utensils were 
made of trees; 13 to 15 per cent did not know the name of the colors green, blue, 
and yellow; from 13 to 18 per cent did not know what their cheek bones, fore- 
head, and throat were. More than three-fourths of all children did not remember 
to have seen any kind of seeds, trees, or vegetable’ in growth. The subjects asked,

after were mostly such as are treated in the first reader and discussed with\tho 
child at the beginning of the common school course. One danger closely connected 
with this may be easily recognized if those teaching do not sufficiently consijler 
how little they may expect from a child—namely, that much of what a child leains 
in school remains simply a matter of memory and empty words, instead of becoming 
real knowledge. i 
Aschild’ .capacity of retaining in the memory numbers of about nine figures has 
berape ; red, and also that this capacity increases with. “age more than other facnl- 
ties; asides, that it is greater with girls than with’boys, and that it necessitates @ 
great amount of talent in continuous and concentrated attention. 
Mr. Earl Barnes, professor of pedagogy in Leland Stanford Junior University, mai 
an investigation concerning the religious conceptions of a child. The investi gation 
was based upon 1,091 compositions, which were written without previous prepara- 
tion by pupils of different ages in the schools or California; and also upon conversa- 
tions between children and mothers or teachers, as well as upon a few recollections 
of older children.’ Among other things it appears that little children have most real- 
istic ideas about God, angels, heaven, ete. God, for example, is a big blue man who 
pours water out of abig bucket in order to produce rain, and who beats the skies when 
itthunders. Professor Barnes advances the idea that the teaching of religion to little 
children has to be done under an anthropomorphic or realistic form. If we really 
teach thom) 28 it should be done, that God isa spirit, their imagination will never- 
theless give Him a human form with human attributes. A child’s imaginations are 
founded largely on pictures which they see... For this, reason it is very important 
that such pictures be good and well done whenever a religious subject is treated, as,    
“for example, Raphael's Sistine Madonna. 
Very recently a society has been founded in the United States for the purpose of 
society is Dr. G. Stanley Hall. The object of the society is “to promote, through 
the organization and cooperation of its members, the scientific study of children, 
among teachers living apart in different places of the country, and among parents 
or other people who pursue scientific child study, so that they may assist each other 
with advice, suggestions, and study plans, and in order that material which belongs 
to one or the other special study may come into the hands of persons who are spe- 
cially interested in working up such matter.” One cireular distributed by the chair- . | 
man of the society contains, among others, suggestions for formulating a general 
plan for ehild study in its entirety. The headings of this plan are as follows: (A) 
_ Physical growth; (1) weighing; (2) measurement; (3) photographs, taking casts, 
etc. (B) Motor tests; (1) general researches; (2) annotations of particular, move- 
ments and plays, which children can-execute in the lower classes of the school; “(3): 
‘strength; (4) promptness; (5) aceutacy; (6).fatigue; (7) language. (C) Thaaires 
regarding the senses. (D) Higher intellectual faculties. (E) Emotions and pas- 
sions. (F) General observations (such as mentioned and directed by E, H. Russell, 
of the normal schoolin Worcester. (G) Abnormal and peculiar children. (H) Mis- 
cellaneous. In the circular itis advanced that observations such as mentioned. under 
(F) may be consideréd as introductory tg-the whole study, and should, so to speak, 
be'practiced as a first stage as often ag circumstances permit. These observations 
are comparatively easy, while the others, on the contrary, require more complicated 
methods or apparatus. Tho person8 ayho devote themselves to special researches 
should apply the strictest attention to the whole plan and make notes of the kind 
last named (F). 
The enlarged knowledge of a child’s-physical and mental characteristics, which 
may result from the movement in question, will no doubt also influence the school 
and everything belonging to it. It 1s indeed desirable that the whole educational

obtained by means of this research work. On the other hand, the sehovlitself offers 
the very best opportunity to collect practical experience respecting children, and to 
apply and try whatever is best for them. Dr. Hall at present entertains the scheme

The writing desks, as well'as other school furniture and apparatus, will be of the

able to comprehend the best methods and to make practical use of them. The school 
is to be under the direction of men of university education, well versed in the history 
of education, in pedagogy, psychology, and hygiene, besides having a personal 
knowledge of the best schools in other countries. The financial condition of the 
school should be such: that it can in every respect use and furnish whatever is the

  GERMANY. 
The German educational exhibit was yery excellent. Great pains and attention 
had been béstowed and large expenditureshad been made for the purpose. To judge 
by the several divisions of this exhibit, which I inspected more in detail, it must 
have been@inong the best of the whole World’s Exposition. Whoever wished to make 
a thorough Study of the German educational system found here ample opportunities, 
a the material had been selected with such painstaking care that it would be 
difficultéo imagine anything more appropriate for a study of this kind. 
“The German educational exhibit had its place in the western gallery.of the’ Manu- 
factures and Liberal Arts Building, on the same side of the building that ¢ontained 
the other exhibits of Germany. A portion of the educational exhibits were placed 
in a smaller gallery above the first named. 
The educational-exhibit comprised the university system, higher education for 
boys, secondary scheols for girls, people’s schools, with normal schools, and schools 
for abnormals. Inthis division I paid special attention to the higher schools for boys 
and girls.and-the people’s schools. However, I have not found it convenient to give 
an Y of their details. The printed catalogue and guides which were distrib- 
uted furnish all the information that can be desired. Nevertheless, I will here touch 
upon a few general features, and on such other items as appear tome of interest. 
The largest part of the German school exhibit consisted of apparatus and matgus 
of various kinds, text-books, wall maps, charts, models, instruments 
physics, etc. One may say that the German exhibit showed, ay 
for the pupils, while the United States exhibit contained 
pupils: 
An important part of the exhibit consisted of colle

relating to the German educational system were specially written for the exhibition, 
and these, with several other works, were accessible in duplicate copies to interested 
visitors. Furthermore, there were collections of annual programmes from various 
kinds of institutions, among these a number of programmes for secondary schools 
for boys in Germany in 1892, besides a complete series of annual programmes from 
1839 to 1892,.from the gymnasium in Frankfort-on-the-Main. For the different 
branches of instruction there were collections of the best and most commonly used 
text-books, or such as indicated certain new tendencies, besides works touching 
upon the methods of teaching various subjects. A complete collection of German 
readers for the people’s schools was of great interest. The collection comprised 225 
volumes and contained all the readers of this class up to date, beginning with F. E. 
von Rochow’s Der Kinderfreund, published for the first time in 1776, the first Ger- 
man reader for people’s schools ever written. A. division of the pupils’ library, 
designated the ‘‘Normal library for girls’ secondary schools,” contained 420 volumes; 
another, from a people’s school in Berlin, had 256 volumes, and still another library, 
for normal school students, contained 560 volumes. 
Of the abundant material for instruction, only the most important will be noted 
here, and this was intended for instruction in natural history. Several series of 
charts for this branch were exhibited. Among these, it seems to me that the well- 
known zoological charts by Lehman-Leutemann (Zoologischer Atlas) occupy the 
most prominent place, and would be of benefit to our own schools. Worthy of 
notice were also Meinholdt’s ‘‘ Wandbilder fiir den Unterricht in der Zoologie,” which 
probably contain more species than the foregoing work; also Leuckart und Nitschl’s 
“ Zoologische Wandtafeln,” besides Engleder’s ‘‘ Wandtafeln fiir den naturkundlichen 
Unterricht.” The latter work contains a botanical and zoological division. Very 
good were Niepel’s ‘‘ Wandbilder des niederen Thierreiches.” Of charts for the anat- 
omy of the human body, there were, besides those by Dr. Fiedler, which are more 
familiar to us, some issued by Max Eschner, four in number and very much like the 
former, but perhaps a little better. A pretty pictorial work is that of Jung, with 
several others, newly issued, ‘‘Neue Wandtafeln fiir den Unterricht in der Naturge- 
schichte,” 22 large charts painted on a black background, and each representing 
a plant or animal type, with many analyses. As a purely botanical picture work 
may be mentioned, above all, Zippel und Bollman’s “Ausliindische Kulturpflanzen,” 
an excellent pictorial work, with carefully elaborated and very valuable text. In 
the edition on exhibit the background was kept in black, while the illustrations 
themselves were colored. The charts in Dodel-Ports ‘“Anatomisch-physiologischer 
Atlas der Botanik” showed very fair illustrations. The work by Lubarsch, ‘‘ Wand- 
tafeln zur Bliitenkunde,” showing flower diagrams of various coloring, I consider 
yery valuable in the instruction of plant families. 
Fine biological and zootomical preparations were exhibited by W. Haferlandt, of 
Berlin. They were preserved in alcohol and kept in air-tight, square glass bottles. 
. les, I quote of the biological preparations: Common frogs (two specimens 
, nine larve, one younger and one older frog, besides a working

NOTES IN REGARD TO THE WORLD’S CONGRESSES. 
By KirstinE FREDERIKSEN, Copenhagen (Frederiksberg). 
In connection with the World’s Exposition at Chicago a number of congresses 
were held during the summer, at which representatives from all parts of the world 
met. Mr. Charles Bonney, the president of these congresses, expressed the hope in 
his opening address that they, as well as the Exposition, might aid in the promotion 
of general fraternity and harmony among the different nations. One of the speakers 
said that he considered the Exposition to be an “annex” to the congresses which the 
participants should not fail to see. Several celebrated persons from Europe were 
present specially for the purpose of delivering addresses at these meetings. Unfor- 
tunately, some representatives restricted themselves to sending in papers, which were 
read by other persons, while the great names were, nevertheless, displayed upon the 
programme. To the Americans, who are fond of having hobbies, these congresses 
frequently seemed to be of much greater interest than the Exposition itself, however 
proud they were of the iatter. They threw themselves with astonishing vigor and 
independence into the discussions; yet even the most callous European could hardly 
fail to become interested in the variety of types and conceptions which he met here. 
A critic could have found various things to criticise, but the person seeking for 
instruction was rarely disappointed. 
The last two weeks in July were devoted to education in all its numerous forms, 
and there was scarcely an educational question which did not appear on the pro- 
gramme and in the discussions. Sometimes the proceedings took the form of a 
simple debate; more frequently a number of previously prepared treatises were read, 
viewing the subject from different points. By addressing their words directly to 
the audience the speakers often succeeded in having a theme well discussed. Most 
successful were the ‘“‘round-table” discussions. 
Mr. Harper, rector of the new University of Chicago, although a clerical gentle- 
man, seems to be well informed in worldly matters. He thoroughly understood how 
to engage prominent professors for the university; many of them are distinguished 
scientific men of mature age, who attract pupils, and there are younger men who 
can bear the burden of heavy work. The university, recently founded, has already, 
among other collections, a richly equipped psycho-physical laboratory, which was 
in full operation within the Exposition grounds. In the selection of the women | 
professors the authorities seem to have been very fortunate. Mrs. Martha Foote 
Crow, professor of English literature, who took an active part in the congress, gave 
an excellent lecture on liberty of teaching at the university. ‘Too often,” said she— 
no doubt she is perfectly right in her assertion—‘“the leading mind at the smaller 
American universities is proved to be an energetic person, but narrow minded withal, 
and sectarian interests are promoted above science.” 
The question of coeducation at the university was also treated thoroughly by Mrs. 
Crow. In her opinion coeducation is worthy of recommendation, though only as the 
smaller of two evils. As in England, many women in America, especially in the 
Eastern States, prefer a university education in institutions for women, even if 
they are in favor of coeducation in the lower classes of the schools, I heard the 
argument advanced in a private conversation that the young girls easily become 
conceited by studying with men, because the latter rarely read with as much dili- 
gence and earnestness as the girls. In a series of pupils’ exercises from a high school 
I found the same opinion expressed by boys. 
In addition to the excellently equipped women’s colleges of the East and the coedu- 
cational universities, usually found in the West, there exists in America a third form— 
the “Annex,” at Harvard University. The professors who give instruction to male 
ED 93——41

students hold separate lectures for women. This is doubtless only a transition state, 
called forth by the peculiar prudery that reigns even in the most cultivated society 
of America (see Howell’s novels). Mrs. Crow stated that she had been confirmed in 
her faith in the coeducation of the sexes when visiting European universities, as she 
had been especially impressed with the fact that young men are greatly in need of 
the comradeship of women. 
Another woman advocate of coeducation in universities called attention to the fact 
that the mere admission of female students to an ordinary university could not be 
considered the final solution of the question. Such a solution could only be found 
in the proper arrangement of the course of study and in taking into consideration 
the influence consequent upon companionship and cooperation. 
A notable woman who attracted special attention was Elizabeth Hughes, from 
England, directress of a teachers’ seminary at Cambridge University. Her most 
excellent thesis touched principally upon the education of teachers, both for higher 
and lower schools. She held the decided opinion that the acquirement of general 
knowledge should be separated from the technical or professional education of 
teachers, which should cover at least a whole year. Let the young men and women 
first endeavor to become well educated, and then let them devote all their mental 
power and energy to the study of their special profession as a teacher. 
Miss Hughes herself received a university education, and she, with Mrs. Crow, 
anxiously desires an international organization for the higher education of women. 
In 1882 the society of ‘‘The Collegiate Alumnz” was founded in the New World, 
with the twofold aim of encouraging a high standard among women students and 
of making their, knowledge and education productive in practical life. This society 
has so high a reputation that universities and colleges consider it both an honor 
and an advantage if their students are admitted as members. Its exhibition in Jack- 
son Park indicated that it had taken hold of such practical problems as the so-called 
“College settlements,” a kind of “people’s palaces,” which are exclusively con- 
ducted by college girls, and it has also taken up work of a more theoretical charac- 
ter, as, for example, the study of child nature. The idea of extending this society 
by means of European branch institutions seemed to meet with the approbation of 
the majority of women who had received a university education, and was especially 
favored by the English women. 
The protection of higher education against a too rapid extension is # problem of 
urgent importance in America. For this reason, members of the most prominent 
universities were appointed at the congress, and it is hoped that they may find 
means for preventing unworthy persons from obtaining the doctor’s degree, 
Of more positive interest were the congresses at which the university professors 
from Worcester and California submitted the results of their psychological experi- 
ments. They, like the women whoreceived a university education, study the child’s 
early manifestations of soul life with special interest. The Ieader of this school of 
young, enthusiastic men and women is Dr. G. Stanley Hall, president of Clark Uni- 
versity, Worcester, Mass. This university is the center of a recent pedagogical 
movement. The normal school students of the city stand in close relation to the 
university, whose professors take pleasure in lecturing to the future public-school 
teachers, while these willingly colleet various facts from daily school life and submit 
them to the disposal of the learned experimentists. In an interesting lecture at the 
congress President Hall expounded his thoughts on the relations between pedagogy 
and psychology. “The hour has come,” he said, “ when the Americans are no longer 
in need of the leading strings of the Germans. So much young and fresh talent 
ought to be able to create something original.” 
When we consider the result of the congress, we may say that experiments are 
always carried on on a broader basis in America than with us. In regard to child 
psychology we have (with a few exceptions) during late years been directed to 
whatever can be learned from Preyer’s observations of a child. When the Ameri-
-P-A-G-E-653

cans take hold of a question, such as the color vision in children, examinations are 
simultaneously carried on in Boston with perhaps 500 children, in Worcester with 
double that number, and in California with from 5,000 to 6,000 children. Mrs. Dana 
Hicks, from Boston, gave some very interesting statistics on this subject. As a 
prominent representative of Prang’s methodical instruction in drawing, she put 
great stress upon the importance of cultivating the child’s sense of color. Several 
curious facts were mentioned. Among others, that difference of race makes itself 
conspicuous in the little child’s partiality for certain colors. White children prefer— 
or recognize—first, yellow and red; negro and Chinese children, usually blue or green. 
A young professor, Mr. Barnes, from the new university in San Francisco, showed a 
number of quite simple drawings made by children of all ages in illustration of a 
picce of poetry read to them. Just as surprising and amusing as were these draw- 
ings—reproduced upon the wall and enlarged side by side with the originals—just 
so ingenious and sympathetic were his interpretations of what the little ones 
intended to express. In the Pedagogical Seminary and the American Journal of 
Psychology one can follow the proceedings and experiments carried on by that 
group of men and women who gather around Dr. G. Stanley Hall. 
Taking place at the same time as the congress of ‘Experimental psy anelone? 
was that of “Rational psychology.” A strange contrast it made; a meeting of men 
of venerable years. Theirspeech seemed in accordance’with tiie age; in so farasI 
could understand, a mixture of Emerson’s transcendentalism, of German philosophy, 
and American theology. However, at a later meeting, I met on that side a youthful 
professor, 2 man with a powerful head, and who was evidently highly gifted, Mr. 
Royce, from Harvard. He tried, apparently, to enter into a compromise with the 
representatives of the Roman Catholic Church. Another group of younger men 
represented the “ ‘Herbartian school.” Professor de Garmo, the author of popular 
educational text-books, seems to be the leader of this movement, which is by no 
means inferior to the above mentioned in regard to the enthusiasm and ardor with 
which they endeavor to introduce their theories into practical school life. Some 
dissension arose in respect to the practicability of Herbart’s psychology as a founda- 
tion of education, while harmony reigned in regard to the adoption of his practical 
educational ideas concérning correlation of the various branches taught at school. 
As original writers and eloquent advocates of the latter, several teachers from 
Francis W. Parker’s Normal School, near Chicago, made themselves heard. 
Mr. Parker himself discussed the subject ‘What shall be taught in the public 
school?” He is known as one of the most prominent “faddists.” A “fad” is some- 
thing temporarily fashionable—a kind of epidemic—and the taxpaying citizen places 
under that head all modern subjects that cost money, such as slijd—sewing in- 
cluded—drawing, physics, and foreign languages, The press and a powerful party 
in the municipal council designate the introduction of such professional training as 
contrary to true American theories. The German population alone, it is said, want 
the introduction of a foreign language in the schools, and a storm of opposition is 
heard in regard to expenditures for teaching sewing and manual training whenever 
@ woman is proposed as candidate for a position in the municipal council. It is 
assumed that there will not be time enough given to the poor children for acquiring 
a knowledge of the three useful R’s (reading, ’riting and ’rithmetic). Probably all 
this commotion is raised in the interest of the taxpayers and their votes on election 
day. 
On the other side stand, for instance, the adherents of Prang’s method of drawing, 
at present in use in Chicago. They proceed with so little consideration and make 
such high demands for certain sets of apparatus that forcible remonstrance is easily 
understood. 
Great impression was made by the lecture of Rabbi Emil Hirsch on the subject of 
manual training. He told the Americans the truth on thissubject. Their unbounded 
admiration for ‘“‘smartness” and exclusive culture of the intellect causes a neglect 
  !
-P-A-G-E-654

of both physical training and manual labor. The American press asserts quite 
undisguisedly as something perfectly natural and correct that the Americans leave 
the foreigners to do the manual labor, while they themselves work with the brain. 
Meanwhile, in the pedagogical world, the current takes a very different trend. 
This was plainly proved by the fact that the discussion on the kindergarten and its 
principles played so large a réle at the teachers’ congress. The many manual train- 
ing exhibits, sent in by public schools, seemed to give significance to the words of 
those people who maintain that the press exerts little influence in America, while, on 
the contrary, the so-called ‘‘ faddists” indicate greater wisdom by going on in their 
own way, with or without the assistance of the press. 
SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF THE EDUCATIONAL EXHIBIT OF THE ' 
WORLD’S FAIR.! 
By M. EvGrarHE KovaLevsky, 
Delegate of the Department of Public Instruction in Russia. 
The first three universal exhibitions, those of London (1851 and 1862) and of Paris 
(1855), did not contain an educational department. This feature appeared for the 
first time at the second Paris Exposition, in 1867, and met with considerable success. 
At the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, in 1876, the department of public 
instruction received due consideration, and visiting foreign instructors were enabled 
to become acquainted with the American public school system. Only a limited 
number of States, however, took part in it—twelve in all—and their exhibits were 
far from complete. : 
The present Exhibition naturally could not dispense with the educational depart- 
ment. Americans are proud of their public school system, and resolved not to spare 
any pains to represent it at the Exhibition in the most complete manner. Besides all 
the States, the different religious denominations, educational societies, publishing 
firms, and even private persons, were invited to send their exhibits. The result was 
an enormous number of exhibits, for the accommodation of which a space was 
assigned many times larger than that of the last exhibition. 
The American exhibit occupied 175,000 square feet and the foreign exhibit 50,000 
square feet. The number of exhibits in this department, judging from catalogues 
and lists furnished, must have been at least 25,000 or 30,000, and as some of these 
exhibits contained 100 or more different objects, the whole was a proof of the un- 
precedented development of the art of instruction in America, as well as in other 
countries. 
Considerable embarrassment was caused to those interested in educational matters 
by the fact that these exhibits were placed not only in the Manufactures and Liberal 
Arts Building, but also in many other buildings. * * * The chief interest cen- 
tered, however, in the exhibits placed in the Manufactures and Liberal Arts Building. 
The exhibits in the different State buildings were outside of competition. 
In the American department the chief importance was given to elementary instruc- 
tion. By this is understood in the United States the instruction given in the schools 
for young children, kindergarten, infant schools, primary schools, grammar schools, 
and high schools.2. Here belong also evening schools, special training schools, and 
normal schools of different grades, whose business it is to prepare teachers for the 
different kinds of schools. * * * 
Having made an arrangement with L. de Dimcha, delegate of the department of 
instruction from Russia, under which I took charge of elementary instruction, while

1893-1894.

ary.”—Eb.
-P-A-G-E-655
EUROPEAN COMMENTS ON AMERICAN EDUCATION. 645 
he took up secondary and higher education, I shall, in my report, speak principally 
of the elementary side, and refer to the other only incidentally. * * * 
He states’ that ‘‘the arbitrary mode of naming institutions of learning in the 
United States must have presented a considerable obstacle to correct classification. 
In absence of a normal classification fixed by law, States, municipalities, and private 
persons give their institutions names which do not correspond to the reality. In 
many institutions named universities the pupils receive only secondary instruction, 
while some colleges, which contain several faculties, in reality correspond to uni- 
versities in the European sense of the word. 
“On the other hand, there are colleges, Girard College, in Philadelphia, for instance, 
which consist really of a preparatory school with some professional instruction. 
‘Academies’ sometimes appear in their course of instruction below the public high 
schools, and these last again are not at all alike. An entirely inappropriate term is 
“State normal university.’ 
“Tt is evident that this variety of names causes a great difficulty in the correct 
classification of the institutions; but whatever was done in that direction will 
prove of assistance for future exhibitions.” 
The diagrams and statistical tables, seen in connection with the State exhibits, 
“proved very useful, as they enabled the visitor to decide whether the exhibit 
deserved a closer examination.” * * * 
The phonographs presented very original innovations. At a certain time they 
were wound up, and delivered opening addresses and discourses on public instruc- 
tion and sometimes—what was still more interesting—the explanations of teachers 
on different subjects, their questions, and the answers of the pupils; or again, a les- 
son in music.and recitation. The State of Colorado exhibited besides a very inter- 
esting innovation, a stenographic report of class recitations. 
Photography, of course, played a very important part. Besides the usual collec- 
tions representing buildings and pupils, there were some instantaneous photographs 
representing pupils at work in the class room. The most complete exhibit in that 
line was from the State of Indiana. These photographs were very interesting; some 
of them represented the pupils during gymnastic exercises. The Boston Normal 
School had aseries of them showing the positions of girls during the exercises. The 
faces in these were veiled in order not to show the features. Drawings vied in 
. Dumber and variety with photography. There were thousands of these drawings 
beginning with the simplest by children of 6 or 7 years, and finishing with paint- 
ings in oil and water colors. 
In the first rank must be mentioned here the Industrial Art School of Philadel- 
phia; avery high-sounding name for an institution where the pupils of intermediate 
schools come twice a week to receive instruction in drawing, modeling, and wood 
carving. This school has worked out a new method in drawing which attracted 
considerable attention at the Exhibition. According to the idea of Mr. J. L. Tadd, 
the director of this school, the drawing is done by the pupils on the blackboard, 
free-hand, using both hands alternately. 
Of the Russian representatives, Prince Wolkonski and Mme. T. B. Semetchkine 
pronounced in favor of the system. Mr. T.H.Gerb expressed himself as skeptical. 
In my opinion the system is deserving of investigation, both from a hygienic and 
educational point of view. 
The manual training exhibit occupied a very considerable space. The collections 
in this were of three kinds: the Swedish (sléjd), the French (the system of Salicis), 
and the American, which is still in a state of development. 
Side by side with the manual training exhibit were placed an infinite number of 
articles prepared according to the Froebel system in the kindergarten schools. Col- 
lections of models in clay made in these latter schools and also in the lower grades 
of primary schools filled the show cases of the State exhibits. 
   
-P-A-G-E-656
  646 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Some of the States did not content themselves with the above-mentioned exhibi- 
tions, and had arranged some exhibitions of the school children at work. In the 
Illinois State exhibit were two of these, a Froebel school and a school fer the blind. 
In a separate building put up by the Indian Bureau was an exhibition of the 
Indian school system. The pupils were living in the building, and were also pre- 
paring tkeir own food there. 
Among the State exhibits those of the older States excelled. The first place 
among these must be accorded to Massachusetts, the city of Boston at the head, 
the so-called Athens of America. * * * 
Exceedingly interesting in this department were the photographs of free public 
libraries, which exist in such numbers and are so situated throughout the State 
[Massachusetts] that the whole population, almost without exception, has access to 
them. * * * A magnificent and extensive exhibit was presented by the State 
and city of NewYork. * * * Not less extensive and complete was the exhibition 
of the State of Ilinois, in which is the city of Chicago. Besides the exhibition of 
children at their work and the model schoolroom, this department showed very rich 
and complete collections. 
The manual training work was very fine. The first place was occupied by the city” 
of Chicago, whoso exhibits were excellent. Both of the State normal schools sent 
interesting exhibits. 
Of the exhibitions of the Northwestern States the best was from Minnesota. A 
number of cities and towns took part in it, but the chief place belonged to St. Paul 
and Minneapolis, twin cities. The general course of elementary instruction was 
very complete there. cs 
In the exhibit of the State of Indiana the principal place also belonged to two 
cities, Indianapolis and Laporte. The first of these sent a beautiful collection of 
photographs. In the schools of this city the method of teaching is based as far as 
possible on the immediate observation of nature. 
Exceedingly interesting were two large wall diagrams showing the distribution 
of young people’s reading circles and of reading circles of teachers. In the State 
of Indiana nearly every school has a library attached, to which the pupils have 
gecess, * .*.-* 
The teachers also haye their special clubs and circles, the aim of which is prin- 
cipally to discuss the latest works on education and compare views on the 
AMO. ¢ 8" : 
From Pennsylvania, as one of the richest and most advanced States of the Union, 
more could have been expected. However, the superintendent had sent a very com- 
plete report of the school work and statistics of public instruction. The visitor 
was impressed. by the great number of schools in the State, 23,000. 
The department of the State of Colorado was interesting by its exhibition of 
phonographs already mentioned, and the stenographic reports of school work of the 
eity of Denver. The English language is particularly well taught in the schools of 
that State. 
The rest of the exhibits were simpler in character, but full of interest. 
Besides tne exhibits of kindergarten connected with the different State exhibits, 
this system of instruction had several sections exclusively devoted to it. The kin- 
dergarten, as a preparatory step to the primary school, has met with success in 
America. It attracts the attention of teachers, although two-thirds of the kinder- 
gartens are private institutions. They have not yet become a part of the system of 
public instruction, as is the case in France with the so-called ‘ maternal schools,” 
and so far exist only incities. At the present time 137 cities and several States have 
acknowledged their usefulness and furnish means for their support. Besides several 
local societies, there was established in 1892 in the city of Saratoga the Interna- 
tional Kindergarten Union, the aim of which is the unification of efforts in that 
direction. 
 
-P-A-G-E-657
    
EUROPEAN COMMENTS ON AMERICAN EDUCATION. 647 
The different show cases in this department belonged to the Kindergarten College 
of the city of Chicago. The work of the pupils was systematically and beautifully 
displayed in the show cases. In the first division of the school, children of 2} to 54 
years attend; in the preparatory department, children from 54 to 6 years; and in the 
elementary department, children from 6 to 7 years; in the industrial classes, children 
are tanght from 6 to 14 years of age. The house of Pestalozzi-Froebel presented. 
the kindergarten system in its most complete and purest form. Close to the house 
was a large garden with all the necessary complementary arrangements. For the 
training of instructors in these schools there is a kindergarten college in the city of 
Ckicago. The course in it embraces three years—the studies are theoretical and 
practical. R 
For technical education we shall point to a group of institutions called normal 
training schools. Two schools of the city of Chicago took part in the exhibition— 
one for beginners, the other a professional school; also technical schools of the fol- 
lowing cities: St. Louis, Toledo, Baltimore, Cincinnati, and New York. Near by was 
the exhibition of the Jewish school of Baron Hirsch, also from New York. 
For an exposition like the Columbian this is a very meager presentation of techni- 
eal education, particularly for a country where technical knowledge stands so high. 
However, Americans do not deceive themselves on the subject and confess that tech- 
nical education is not as general with them as it ought to be. 
Tverskoi, the author of Letters from America, speaks of a justice of the peace 
who, having sentenced a young offender to the reformatory, congratulated him on 
the happy prospect for him of acquiring a trade, which, owing to the lack of insti- 
tutions of that kind, did not fall to the lot of many. 
From the present short review of the exhibition we shall have to exclude the 
institutions for the blind, for the deaf and dumb, and for the feeble minded; also 
the schools for the colored race, and the school of the Woman’s Christian Temperance 
Union, whose work is deserving of particular attention. 
The department of school appliances, text-books, and school material was located 
in the northern part of the building. The exhibit of books for school use was very 
large. * * * Besides the International Educational Series, Appleton has published 
many volumes of compilations on similar subjects. Other firms pay principal atten- 
tion to text-books, which, being in great demand, prove very profitable. There is a 
great variety in the quality of text-books. Some of the poor, out-of-the-way schools, 
consisting of one class, use only small editions printed on cheap paper, while the rich 
city schools of such- centers as New York or Boston and St. Louis use very hand- 
some editions. This variety, however, has its inconveniences, and lately there has - 
been a tendency to centralization in that line. 
We made a collection of text-books used in the primary schools which can give 
an idea of the character and distinctive features of the books used for instruction in 
American schools. It has been forwarded to the educational library of the depart- 
ment of public instruction in Russia. 
In the exhibit of the United States Bureau of Education a model library of 5,000 
volumes was arranged. Reports and statistical tables were displayed; also photo- 
graphs of school buildings. A separate show case was devoted to the schools of 
Alaska. 
The model library was selected by a special commission of experts from the Ameri- 
can Library Association. It consisted of 5,000 of the most suitable books, in the 
opinion of the experts, for acity public library. The publishers’ prices of the books, 
without reduction, amounted to $12,000. All these books were entered in a special 
catalogue of 300 pages. 
Those interested in the formation of a library were especially attracted to this 
exhibit, as all the most modern inventions for the cataloguing, finding, and preser- 
vation of books and pamphlets were made use of. At the close of the Exposition 
this library will be sent to Washington to be placed in the Bureau of Education.

  648 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Professor Rice, who was commissioned by The Forum to make a study of theschool 
work of the country, characterized the first impression of his visit by the very 
expressive word ‘‘chaos.” Doubtless there is a great difference in the mode of 
instruction, programmes, and results achieved by the different primary schools> At 
the same time they also have a great deal in common; essentially the same Ameri- 
can spirit animates them all. There is also a constant tendency toward a unification 
of the methods of instruction. 
Of the three fundamental principles on which the work of public instruction is 
agitated in western Europe, namely, compulsory attendance, free instruction, and 
neutrality in regard to religion, the two last are acknowledged in all the States 
of the Union. * * * Gradually, but not without a severe struggle, the people 
came to the conviction that elementary education must be accessible to all, to the 
poor as well as the rich. A decidedly new departure in this direction was taken in 
1837 under the leadership of Horace Mann, the well-known worker in the educa- 
tional field. The free school system is at present firmly established in the States of 
the Union. * * * The second in importance is the nonsectarian character of the 
schools, which is acknowledged by all the States. A great many different denomi- 
nations and sects exist in the Union, and in the absence of a state religion, and in 
the presence of a complete separation of church and state, it is natural that the 
schools should exclude from their programme dogmatic theology. The children of 
the different denominations receive religious instruction from their spiritual instruct- 
ors in the so-called Sunday schools. In the public schools the duties of the teacher 
are to set their pupils a good example in morality and good conduct. In some 
States the custom of reading the Bible in the schools is still kept up, but without 
any special comment being made. 
The third principle, compulsory attendance, is so far in force only in 27 States; 
the others are on the way to its introduction. Since 1886 this tendency has been 
increasing. Free admission of all children to the schools exists in principle in the 
Northern, Eastern, and Western States. All the children of acertain district or town 
have aright to attend the same school, without distinction of sex, condition, or race. 
In the 16 Southern States separate schools are established for the negroes. In practice 
the children of colored races attend separate schools in the other States also. This 
is principally the case in the primary grades; in the higher grades this distinction 
is not made. 
A very characteristic trait of American schools is the coeducation of the sexes and 
the similarity of the education of girls to that of boys in all branches. Coeduca- 
- tion is in practice now in the whole country, with the exception of a few large cities. 
The girls study with the boys, not only in the elementary schools, but also in the 
secondary schools and in the universities. The results, according to the unanimous 
testimony of American instructors, are very satisfactory. The young people are gen- 
tle in their behavior in class; the girls work more diligently in trying to emulate 
their companions. There are no shortened programmes or simplified text-books for 
girls; they are working with the boys on an equal footing and frequently surpass 
them in the progress made. * * * 
In the sphere of State legislation a tendency toward unification and centralization 
is noticeable. At the head of the school work of each State stands (1) the State 
board of education, (2) county boards of education, (3) city boards of education, (4) 
district school boards. With the committees of the first three orders are superin- 
tendents, whose duty it is to inspect the schools and the school work. 2 ne 
In view of the great importance given to school hygiene in recent years, it is the 
duty of inspectors to see that all the rules are complied with in regard to vaccina- 
tion, the prevention of the spread of contagious diseases, heating and ventilation 
of the buildings, ete. The number of supervising officers in this branch in the 
United States is 2,694.
-P-A-G-E-659
EUROPEAN COMMENTS ON AMERICAN EDUCATION. 649 
Tn the public press and in the reports of the Commissioner of Education it is con- 
stantly pointed out that this work has not yet attained its proper proportion. The 
opposition to it comes from the local school committees, but the tendency is to 
inctease it. The school committees of large cities rival frequently in influence the 
State committees. They are generally quite independent and merely send their sta- 
tistical reports to the State superintendent. In the schools of the far West, situated 
on the prairies or in mountainous districts, the teachers manifest great independence 
in their school work, in teaching as well as in the government of the schools. But 
it is different in the older States. There the school boards define very carefully how 
and what shall be taught during the year. The regulations to this effect form whole 
volumes—a schoolroom guide, whére teachers can find full instructions for action in 
every possible contingency. These regulations for the duties of teachers are not 
made from a desire to narrow down their liberty of action, which would be contrary 
to the American spirit, but in view of a practical necessity. 
Owing to the conditions of American life, teachers @o not remain long in their 
places. Buisson, in his valuable work on American schools, mentions the State of 
Kansas, where one-third of the teachers are changed annually; in the New England 
States it is one-fifth. The certificates presented by the candidates for teaching 
testify to their knowledge of subjects taught, not to their ability to conduct a class; 
consequently in some of these regulations furnished to young teachers innovations 
are expressly forbidden, as they would lead only to a loss of valuable time. The 
committee makes a written contract with the teacher in which all the duties of 
the latter are enumerated. At the end of the year the teachers have to present to 
the superintendent a full report on the condition of the schools intrusted to them. 
For the preparation of teachers there are special institutions—normal schools—in 
which the course lasts from two to four years. For negro teachers there exist special 
normal schools and educational institutions to the number of 40. One-third of them 
are supported by religious and educational societies. Graduates of normal schools 
do not form a large percentage of teachers. 
  Per cent. 
For Maine - 28 
For New Hampshire 17 
For Connecticut - 42 
    
And only in the small State of Rhode Island it amounts to 70 per cent. 
The female teachers outnumber the males. In the Froebel schools they reign 
supreme, and predominate also in the one-class schools, in the elementary and 
intermediate schools. * * * Evidently the passing of elementary instruction 
into the hands of women exelusively is only a question of time in the United 
States. * * * 
In the programme of study for the different elementary schools there is great 
variety. American elementary schools are divided into two large groups, the graded 
and ungraded schools. The ungraded schools consist of one class with one teacher. 
Their principal aim is to teach those attending them ‘the three R’s” : Reading, writ- 
ing, arithmetic. As soon as there is an opportunity these schools are converted into 
graded schools. The graded schools, as already stated, are of three kinds, primary, 
intermediate or grammar, and high schools. The course in these extends from five 
to six or eight years. * * * " 
The English language is unconditionally compulsory in the public schools of the 
United States, even where the majority of the population speak a different language. 
The American schools have a very difficult task to perform. They have to train 
children to become citizens capable of taking part in public affairs from such diverse 
material as the native Yankees, the negroes, the Indians, and the foreign immi- 
grants, consisting of Germans, Irish, French, Italians, Swedes, Norwegians, Poles, 
Russians, and Danes. All these persons could not take part in the affairs of the 
country unless they were familiar with its language, for which reason the schools 
  |

-P-A-G-E-660
  650 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93, 
pay particular attention to this instruction. The number of schools and pupils is 
very great, and during the last decade great progress has been noticed in this direc- 
Mone SFA 
Private denominational elementary schools are of little importance. Of the whole 
number of pupils only 9 per cent attend them. The remaining 91 per cent attend 
the public schools. * * * 
The high average cost of school buildings in the United States is due to the fact 
that they are put up now in the most modern style. They are remarkable for the 
comfort and fitness’ in their arrangement of class rooms as well as for handsome 
architecture. Many of the schools contain large halls for gymnastic and other exer- 
cises and meetings, workshops for manual training, libraries, and physical and 
chemical laboratories. 
In contrast to these city schools, the country schools have frequently very poor 
accommodations. In the mountain districts and on the prairies the common log 
schoolhouse is still met with. The majority of these schools have frame buildings. 
Theso last are a special American invention. Externally they resemble pretty cot- 
tages; they do not cost much, and are furnished complete from the manufactory. 
But they have their disadvantages; in the winter they are cold, in the summer very 
warm, and when the wind blows high they are turned over like card houses.!. The 
reports that cyclones have carried off whole villages are not fables. I myself had a 
chance of seeing a little village destroyed by the wind. The inhabitants had 
encamped around the spot andseemed not to grieve much about what had happened. 
Some of the houses, among them the schoolhouse, which had been lying on its side, 
were propped up, and the people were rebuilding the other houses. 
The division of gymnastic apparatus was especially examined by T. Tv. Guerd, who 
purchased at the Exposition some portions of the apparatus which seemed to him 
particularly new and interesting. Such gymnastic apparatus as was purchased was 
forwarded to the educational museum connected with the military institutions in 
St. Petersburg, where it can be seen by those interested in the subject. Besides the 
section of gymnastic apparatus, a very extensive collective exhibition of the so-called 
North American Turn-Verein was deserving of attention. 
These gymnastic associations, judging from the pamphlets at the Exposition, have 
for their aim the physical development of children, youths, and grown persons; 
besides, they are trying to improve the mental development of their members by 
instituting reading circies aud clubs where debates are carried on and pamphlets 
and books published. The leaders in this movement assert that gymnastic exercises, 
practiced in circles and in schools, tend to form a nation of good soldiers in case of 
need, and in the meantime develop in the young courage, independence, presence of 
mind, and cheerfulness. * * * 
The collective exhibit of commercial schools attracted tho attention of specialists 
and merchants. Commercial education in America presents peculiar characteris- 
tics suited to the local needs and circumstances of the great transatlantic Repub- 
lic. * * * These colleges, or schools, very well supply the demand for trained 
bookkeepers, stenographers, and typewriters, and are a great convenience to candi- 
dates for these positions. 
At the Universal Exposition in Paris in 1889 the Catholic clergy declined to take 
part, the relations of. the clerical power and the Republic were strained, and in the 
French educational department the public school reigned supreme. It was con- 
cluded te make up for this omission at the Columbian Exposition. 
According to the idea of Cardinal Gibbons, of Baltimore, there were to be col- 
lected for the Exposition exhibits of Catholic schools of the whole world, and the 
arrangement was to be as interesting and extensive as possible, in order to present 
to the public the results of the labors of the Catholic clergy in the field of popular

instruction, and thus to advocate the idea of parish schools. To the appeal of the 
Cardinal the majority of Catholic schools of America and some institutions of 
France, Spain, and England responded. Tho exhibits from these countries formed 
together a collective exhibition which occupied the enormons space of 29,000 square 
fect. There were taking part in it 12 brotherhoods of Benedictines, Capuchins, 
Jesuits, and the order of Christian Brothers; 37 sistcrhoods, of which we noticed 
tho Sisters of Notre Dame, the Sisters of Merey, the Sisters of the Poor in Christ, 
Sten a * 
Of the European institutions there were represented at the exhibition 68 from 
France, 5 from Spain, and 2 from England. 
There was plenty of material for inspection, even an excess of it. Most promi- 
nent were female handiwork and drawings. The Christian Brothers exhibited in 
their American schools the work of pupils in the English language of very good 
quality, also in composition. In the diocese of Kentucky some water colors were 
prominent; in woodwork a carved altar of very fine execution, the work of the 
pupils of St. Joseph’s Orphan Asylum, in Columbus, Ohio. 
In looking over the programme of study in the parish schools of the diocese of 
Philadelphia I noticed that in the grammar grado schools the geographies only men- 
tioned, in regard to Russia, that the River Volga flowed there and that there were 
three cities, St. Petersburg, Moscow, and Odessa, 
The schools for deaf-mutes of St. Etienne, Besancon, Bourg, and Bienne exhibited 
appliances for the instruction of their pupils, with illustrations of the position of the 
lips in pronouncing the letters. In the commercial department of the schools of 
Havre a small museum was established, where all imported products were exhibited 
as an assistance in the study of commercial geography and natural science. 
In some of the French schools the study of stenography was introduced as an inno- 
yation, which is of great practical importance at present. In examining the albums 
and collections in this department I was moro than once surprised to find that the 
character of the subjects was throughout connected with the church. The drawings 
were copies of images and church frescos; architectural work was devoted to church 
edifices; even cabinetmaking and the ironwork had a church character. Such 
specialization can hardly prove desirable, in view of the small industrial importance 
of such work. Taken in general, this department showed that the Catholic clergy 
was working very energetically in the field of public instruction. 4 
The department of the different Protestant churches and religious associations pre- 
sented a mass of facts in regard to their activity in public instruction. The first 
placo must be assigned here to tho section of the Congregationalists. *  * * od 
» Tho Methodists have founded 10 religious seminaries, theological faculties at some 
universities, 45 male and female colleges, and 61 classical seminaries; the Baptists, 
34 colleges, 7 theological institutions, and 50 academies, principally in the South- 
ern States; tho United Brethren in Christ, 2 universities, 9 colleges, 6 academies, and 
1 male seminary; the Disciples of Christ, 5,756 Sunday schools. In this department 
was also the exhibit of a very attractive association, called the Young Men’s Chris- 
tian Association. Branches of this association exist in many countries of Europe, 
Asia, and Africa, and in tho islands of the Pacific. In Russia (probably in Finland 
and the Baltic provinces) there are9 of them, The association exercises an extensive 
and beneficial influence, and its activity has the sympathy of the people. 
The Jews had two exhibits, the professional institutions of Baron Hirsch and the 
collective exhibition of the Allianco Israelite Universelle. The schools of this asso-| 
ciation did not presenta denominational character. Their aims are purely educa-| 
tional, and they try to avoid the narrow spirit of exclusiveness. It has nearly 40,000 
members. It has taken up the difficult task of assisting the moral and intellectual 
development of the Jews, of encouraging the acquirement of professions and trades, 
of struggling against their ignorance and faults, frequently the result of ill-founded 
prejudices, and of assisting as much as possible in their emancipation in those coun-      
-P-A-G-E-662
  
    652 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
tries where they do not enjoy full civil and religious liberty. This association, work- 
ing outside of political and religious questions, directs its activity, according toa 
circular published, principally to the work of education, and has established schools 
founded on the modern demands of education, in place of the old Talmud Toro’s 
school, which is of a sectarian character. These schools have been established in 
Turkey, Bulgaria, and on the shores of the Mediterranean in Asia Minor and Africa, 
The show cases at the Exposition were filled with a quantity of articles; the exhibits 
of agricultural institutions excited special interest, as they proved that with proper 
education the young Jews were capable of taking an interest in agriculture, for 
which in Russia they generally show an aversion. 
In the same proportion as the exhibit of the United States was extensive, many- 
sided, and interesting, the exhibit of foreign countries was modest and incomplete, 
with the exception of, perhaps, Germany, Russia, and France. This is quite nat- 
ural. Those who come to an exhibition generally come with the intention of study- 
ing the local educational system, caring comparatively little for the education of 
foreign countries, which is already known to them. The school, and particularly 
the primary school, is so intimately connected with the conditions and customs of 
the country to which it belongs that it is necessary for the proper understanding of 
it to know something of the country itself, of its inhabitants, and to be able to visit 
personally some of its institutions. Since exhibitions have become so frequent, 
pupils and teachers would be losing valuable time in preparing for them. In the 
case of one’s own exposition this is different, for it appears to those in charge of 
public instruction similar to a general examination with the whole nation for its 
audience. 
Of the European countries, Russia, France, Germany, and England had arranged 
fairly good exhibitions. The first place must doubtless be awarded to Germany for 
the fuliness, variety, and interest of its exhibit. The external facade of the build- 
ing was very handsome. There were over 500 exhibits sent, representing primary 
schools, intermediate schools, universities, special institutions of all kinds, and the 
German department of public instruction. A very large collection of text-books, 
books, atlases, globes, wall maps, and other school appliances, work of pupils, and 
photographs completed the exhibit. 
The second place belonged to the Russian school exhibit, which occupied five 
rooms. In the first room was the exhibit of the educational museum—a complete col- 
lection of school appliances, text-books, different editions, etc., all very tastefully 
and cleverly arranged by the distinguished educator, T. Tv. Guerd. Next came 
the room with the exhibit of the department of communication (roads), and the 
room containing private exhibits, conspicuous among which was a beautiful show 
case from the cartographical establishment of Illiine; a copy of the book of Mme. 
Altchevski, What the People Should Read; the section of the association for the 
extension of the Holy Scriptures, the calculating machine of Oder, the universal 
school bench of Professor Brandt, of the University of Charkoff, and the exhibits of 
the Technical Institute of St. Petersburg, etc. To the left of the second corridor 
were arranged two alcoves; one was occupied by the exhibit of the Central School 
of Technical Drawing of Baron Stieglitz, the other by that of the School of Draw- 
ing of the Society for the Encouragement of Fine Art. 
Opposite to these was a large room devoted to the institutions of the Empress 
Marie. This department was in the care of Mme. Semetchkine, who is well known 
in America and who was at the Exposition in Philadelphia. The handiwork of 
women attracted general attention. The Demidoff Asylum for Working People in 
St. Petersburg had on exhibition a present intended for the President of the United 
States, a handsome scarf of red satin embroidered after an antique Russian design 
of the thirteenth century. For the wife of the President was a large sachet, on 
which was represented the arrival of the steamer Leo with Ametican cereals in the 
unfortunate year of our famine. The majority of the exhibits of the department of
-P-A-G-E-663

the Empress Marie were presented to the Americans as an acknowledgment of their 
fraternal assistance.. Next came the room of the department of public instruction, | 
the exhibit of which was very complete. The exhibit of the school district of the 
Caucasus was very complete and interesting. Here also were the publications of 
the imperial commission for the introduction of reading among the people. 
France occupied three rooms filled with cases in which were displayed text-books, 
other school books, and the work of pupils. Of theselast must be noticed the so-called 
“cahiers de roulement,” in which each pupil in turn writes his schooltask. A book 
is received in which all the pupils of the class have taker part, and which gives the 
inspector a clear idea of the condition of the class and serves as a great stimulus to 
the pupils for carrying on their tasks in an earnest manner. Next to the room of 
the department of public instruction was the exhibition of the well-known Paris 
school “ Ecole des Arts et Métiers.” 
In the English division of the exhibition in the Manufactures Building was the 
exhibit of the city of London, of the science and art department which had sent 
the work of pupils, and of the University of Oxford, demonstrating the system of 
university extension. This system is known in Russia through the works of the 
Moscow professor, T. T. Yanjul. 
In the Woman’s Building, Great Britain presented many interesting things in 
regard to female education, principally the higher education; in primary education 
there was very little to be seen in this building. Very interesting and convincing 
was an exhibition of card photographs of the babies of some ladies who had received 
a degree in the English universities. The object of these cards was to show that 
study did not unfit women to be mothers. The proof was very striking, for the 
babies looked so well, so fat, and so full of life that it was a pleasure to see them, 
and the mothers by their side in their professors’ caps had reason to be proud of 
them. 
The attention of foreign educators and representatives of learning centered, after 
the United States, principally on the other American countries and colonies. The 
exhibitions of the two countries adjacent to the United States, Canada and Mexico, 
although placed side by side, were very dissimilar. Tho race characteristics of each 
were immediately apparent. The exhibits of Canada occupied severalrooms. There 
were sections of public instruction in the different provinces, which are perfectly 
independent of each other in this respect; there were those of Catholic and Protest- 
ant schools, and those of private firms and individuals. 
Among the provincial exhibitions the most interesting was that of the Province 
of Ontario. The department of public instruction of this Province had published 
for the exhibition a very excellent book, The Educational System of the Province of 
Ontario. 
In Mexico public instruction has advanced considerably of late years, but the 
percentage of students is still only 4.7. In theory, education is considered free and 
compulsory, but in practice, particularly in the less populous States where the 
Indians predominate, compulsory attendance can not be enforced yet. Coeducation 
is found only in exceptional cases. The civilized Indians are taught with the whites. 
For those not yet civilized special schools are established, where the teachers are 
young Indians, taken from the same tribe and trained in institutions for teachers. 
There are in Mexico 2,878 Government schools for boys, and 1,079 for girls; mixed 
schools, 327; municipal schools for boys, 3,176, and 1,056 for girls; mixed, 503. 
Total, 9,039. 
There are schools for the training of male teachers, and one in the City of Mexico 
for the training of female teachers. Besides these, there are in the country 2 agricul- 
tural colleges, 1 commercial college, and 3 technical schools for pupils of both sexes. 
Side by side with the.public schools there flourish also a considerable number of 
private schools, principally under the direction of the Catholic clergy. 
Among the countries of South America let us consider in passing the little Repub- 
lic of Uruguay, which has given a good example of energy and perseverance in the 
   
-P-A-G-E-664
    654 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
work of public instruction. Until 1877, when the law for general education was 
first passed there, the schools were in a very low state. There were only 412 schools ; 
in the whole country, and these furnished a limited amount of instruction. In 1891, 
the date of latest statistics, the number of schools had wore than doubled, and the 
number of pupils was more than three times as great. Education was made free 
and compulsory; for the training of teachers of both sexes there were two semi- 
naries; the teachers were twice assembled in educational congress; for the study of 
the latest subjects of investigation specialists were sent to Europe; an educational 
museum was established at the capital. The instruction in the schools is according 
to the latest demands in education. The school buildings aro improved and well sup- 
plied; many have libraries attached to them. The number of pupils to each teacher 
is 36, which is not excessive. The country has one kindergarten and an industrial 
school. By the side of the public schools there are also private institutions. 
In each department (the Government subdivisions of the country) is organized a 
committee of public instruction, the members of which serve without pay and each 
division has an inspector. The Government spends annually one-ninth of its income 
for public instruction; the price of the education of each pupil amounts to $13.27. 
Asa result of these efforts there is a great improvement in primary instruction. In 
the words of the report, “; £1 carécter de la ensefianza es educativo, racional, apro- 
piado, rigorosamente gradual, y por lo tanto, progresivo, integro, armonio, vivo, 
agradable y, sobre toda, prdéctico 4 fin de que dicha ensefianza repose sobre bases 
solides!” 
To a Northerner this excessive enthusiasm and delight may appear naive, but when 
the object of it is the education of the people we must respect it. Every country 
could be and ought to be proud of a similar success. The people of Uruguay must 
have remembered the words of the late President Garfield, that “Good schools are 
less expensive than revolutions.” 
It would take too long to examine the other American countries, particularly since 
only a few of them (Brazil, Jamaica) had school exhibits; for this reason we shall 
content ourselves with the following statistical table:

The only province from Australia to take part in this department of the Exhibi- 
tion was New South Wales. In the whole of Australia the number of students in 
the different institutions is 256,151, or 22 per cent of the population. The expenses 
of school education for each pupil amounts to $18.65, which is a very high figure. 
Among the Asiatic countries the exhibition of Japan was most interesting. The 
movement for better school organization began there comparatively late in 1872. 
The laws governing the present school system date from the year 1886. Owing to 
their natural power of imitation the Japanese have taken the European school sys- 
tem, and, after making some slight alterations in it, present it as a national one. 
The education is compulsory; it is nonsectarian and free, although the children of 
the rich pay a certain sum on entering the school. The number of pupils is consid- 
erable. The small number of girls in comparison with that of boys (less than one- 
third) shows that the principle of female education has not as yet taken root in 
Japan. The expenditures for public instruction reach the sum of $9,000,000, of 
which 80 per cent is spent on primary education. 
Of the other countries in Asia the Island of Ceylon had a separate building where 
very interesting ethnological collections were exhibited. In public instruction the 
exhibits were very few, although the cause of education is beginning to develop in 
this colony. To the north of Ceylon is the great Indian Empire. Here tlie work of 
education is still weaker, although on the whole it is making progress. 
From Africa, Egypt took part in the Exhibition. ‘The exhibits there were not 
large but interesting. In the city primary schools both English and French are 
taught. English language is used in 2,237 schools, the French in 2,840 schools. 
In conclusion we must notice the exhibitions of some associations not directly 
connected with the work of education but whose activity is of a humanitarian 
character. 
The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and the Society for the Pre- 
vention of Cruelty to Animals were fairly well represented. 
An interesting exhibit was that of the Society of the Friends of Peace, which 
counts several millions of members and advocates peace, fraternity of nations, and 
the establishment of international courts of arbitration, and which is gaining so 
many adherents. Until the present time there have been seventy-five cases of arbi- 
tration between the people of Europe, Asia, and America, which have resulted in a 
peaceful solution of the difficulties. In 1890 all the States of America had adopted 
the principle of arbitration. The Peace Society of the last international congress 
expressed the wish to have this principle introduced in the study of history and to 
have the cult of war diminished. 
The American Bible Society occupied considerable space. The extensive and ener- 
getic work of this society is known the world over. Its editions are printed in thirty- 
two languages, and the Bible published by this society can be found in the remotest 
parts of Siberia, as well as in the extreme north of Canada, in the center of Africa, 
and in the torrid parts of Asia. 
Lastly, the exhibit of the National Temperance Union showed that the yearly 
amount spent by the population of the United States for spirituous liquors, tobacco, 
and stimulants exceeded the expenses for bread, meat, clothing, education, or religion. 
With this we shall conélude our brief report on the educational department of the 
Universal Exhibition in the city of Chicago. This department was, on the whole, 
extensive, many-sided, and interesting, and embraced every possible kind of institu- 
tion of learning. The grouping of the exhibits, the introduction of phonographs, 
the practical exhibition of school children at work, the model school building, the 
large part taken in the Exhibition by the clergy and by various associations formed 
its chief characteristics. * * * The departments of foreign countries, particu- 
larly of new countries, ‘testified to the fact that the organization and proper 
maintenance of public instruction forms at the present time one of the chief cares 
of a government, and that the fundamental principles of gratuitous public instruc- 
 
-P-A-G-E-666
656 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
tion, compulsory attendance, end the proper training of teachers are generally 
acknowledged.” 
Collectively the exhibit of American schools “‘presented overpowering material. 
It showed how broad and deep was the spread of public instruction in the United 
States. Granted that it is not yet firmly established, that there are sometimes inex- 
perienced teachers, and as yet many a flaw in the school laws, yet its general ten- 
dency is such as to make one forget these shortcomings.” 
Americans have reached the conviction that the ‘ignorance of the people is a 
shame to the country and its greatest misfortune. They are trying by all the means 
in their power to dispel the darkness of ignorance, and, notwithstanding great 
obstacles and the constant influx of immigrants, they are attaining these ends.” 
*» * * Tt is true that their general school system ‘‘ presents much patchwork and 
want of harmony, but in the present feverish state of American life there is no time 
to wait; the accessible must be made use of. The result shows us thousands of schools 
spread over the country where millions of children are taught, and the spread of 
knowledge among the population greater than anywhere else.” 
The Exposition itself is the “best proof of it. Only an independent, wealthy, 
and educated people would create such an Exposition, and only an educated and 
thinking population could appreciate it.”

  CHAPTER VIL. 
AMERICAN TECHNOLOGICAL SCHOOLS.' 
Report of Professor RIEDLER, of the Royal Polytechnicum at Berlin. 
INTRODU 
  rION. 
The question as to what schools in America may be considered technological (or 
polytechnical) schcols can not be answered definitely, since there are no sharply 
defined lines between the various institutions with regard to that which they teach. 
Public education is an affair of the separate States and communities, and the con- 
ceptions of the State and city boards of education, as well as the views of princi- 
pals and teachers of the various institutions, differ very much with reference to 
matter and method of instruction. The consequence is a very great variety of 
schools despite their uniform nomenclature. 
In order to gain a proper point of view, I was obliged, on my earlier journeys 
undertaken for the purpose of study, to devote more time and labor to the schools than 
to professional studies. I was not satisfied with the information gathered from 
catalogues or from visiting the institutions and asking for explanation from princi- 
pals and professors, who naturally give only a picture of the school as it should be 
or might be, but fail to let the visitor see the actual results and their connection 
with the prevailing circumstances. Sound judgment and deep insight could be 
secured only by long-continuéd intercourse with former students, now renowned 
authoritative American engineers, and with young men who are at present students 
of the institutions. I was actually obliged to become a student myself to get 
acquainted with particulars concerning which it was impossible to obtain informa- 
tion in any other way. 
Owing to the great number of “technological schools” in America (over 200) I had 
to confine my research to the most noted ones. In this work I enjoyed the coopera- 
tion of my colleague, Mr. Gutermuth, of Aachen, which I gratefully acknowledge. 
In the following report the characteristics of technological schools are pointed 
out. A critical comparison with our conditions and institutions is at present pre- 
cluded. The simple description of the instruction offered requires a thorough study 
conducted without prejudice, and European standards of measurement must not be 
applied. Criticism is very difficult, because it is hard to separate it from personal 
views, and also because it can not be done without entering into the totality of the 
work of the schools and their historical development. This would lead us back to 
ancient and to modern educational controversies which must be excluded from the 
exposé I desire to offer. 
Critical comparisons in questions of education are most thankless tasks, not that 
they are not extremely interesting, but owing to the endless attacks which, as is 
well known, invariably follow an undertaking like this. 
The difficulties caused by a simple comparison of American schools with one another 
may be seen from the following facts: A contributor of the Engineering News, Mr. 
  + 
1The following report on technological schools, by Prof. A. Riedler, of the Polytechnical School at 
Charlottenburg; near Berlin, is inserted here for two reasons. It gives an unbiased description of a 
kind of school concerning which there is not as yet unanimity of opinion in America, and also, 
because the author offers some standards of measurement and comparison in graphic manner that 
deserve to be studied. A praiseworthy absence of prejudice distinguishes the author and his report.

  658 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93, 
Wellington, last year published a series of articles on the establishment and the 
present status of American schools for the preparation of civil engineers, and thereby 
rendered great service, since they offered for the first time a review at least of this 
particular kind of technological school; and he attempted the beginning of statis- 
tical summaries that were in every way new and instructive for America, Although 
Mr. Wellington had refrained, for obvious reasons, from expressing his own opinion 
of the results of these schools, he was so overwhelmed with communications and 
corrections that he abandoned the idea of gathering his articles in book form. 
These articles contain very valuable statistical matter concerning the schools for 
civil engineering, which I have used, with some additions collected by myself. His 
historical statements, those of attendance, and his comparative summaries of courses 
of study Ihave used copiously. Through conversations with him I gathered much 
information and valuable suggestions. 
My studies embraced the institutions of learning which prepare for, or give, poly- 
technical instruction, first of all the universities that have a school of engineering, 
and then the independent polytechnica. Generally my remarks refer to the schools 
of mechanical engineering, though many of my remarks hold good for the other 
schools also. 
PREPARATION OF ENGIN UNITED STATES PREVIOUS TO 1862.    RS IN 
  Engineering as a profession in America dates back no further than 1850. Its first 
beginnings may have been as early as 1830. Polytechnical institutions are therefore 
not old; their prosperity commenced at the beginning of the sixties. Hence it is 
obvious that the greatest number of these schools, especially in the West, are still 
in an imperfect state of development. 
Before the polytechnica,were called into existence the preparation of engineers 
was possible only through self-study, occupation in workshops, private instruction 
from experienced engineers, or in military schools. 
(1) Self-instruction.—A large number of the older engineers are self-taught. Self- 
instruction is not a correct term, for even self-taught men go to school, to the school 
of experience. Individual experience without comprehension of cause and effect 
has little, if any, value. Franklin said in his old-fashioned manner, ‘Experience 
keeps a dear school, but fools learn in no other.” But where experience is coupled 
with investigation of the connection between cause and effect a basis is given for 
scientific knowledge. Such a course of development was formerly customary, but is 
at. present considered an exception. It can be demonstrated that many of the most 
_noted engineers of all civilized countries, without having had real ‘instruction,” 
are yet Scientifically equipped, because they have used their experience in the way 
referred to, and, as a rule, laboriously acquired scientific knowledge. At present it 
may be said that this expensive and laborious mode of preparation has become very 
rare in America, so that its description seems unnecessary here. 
(2) Preparation through apprenticeship.—A second method is the preparation in work- 
shops, which is still popular in England and America. It is astonishing to notice 
that English engineers, and here and there American imitators, began their course 
of preparation as apprentices in factories, never enjoyed regular scientific instruc- 
tion, and yet have become well reputed men in their professions, They still adhere 
to this system, although they ail admit that they had to spend much time and trouble 
to gain the essential scientific basis by means of self-instruction from books. They 
further admit that the scientific knowledge they did gain became the absolutely nec- 
essary basis of their work. A course of preparation beginning with apprenticeship 
in a factory leads to a one-sided practical perfection, very imperfect professional 
Inowledge, and to this only if the conditions of self-instruction mentioned are ful- 
filled. In America this system was only temporarily followed in the New England 
States, and has almost disappeared.

(8) Instruction through experienced engineers.—As late as two decades ago the tech- 
nical preparation of students through distinguished civil engineers was a course fre- 
quently followed in England, and is to this day in the New England States; here 
and there in other countries it is also followed not infrequently. The preparation 
of architects in America is almost exclusively obtained in this way. This instruction 
in private lessons usually lasts three years, but, as a matter of course, is never well 
regulated. Thestudent must keep his eyes and ears open, ask questions, and arrange 
his scientific knowledge according to the answers he receives, That which is learned 
in this manner is of course, quantitatively, very little, but qualitatively more val- 
uable than that which is obtained in schools, because the students obtained it only 
through thorough study, their own efforts, and hard thinking. That this mode of 
preparation is so successful in many instances is certainly also owing to the fact that 
they chose renowned engineers as teachers, 
(4) Military schools.—Before 1840 real instruction in engineering was offered almost 
exclusively in the Military Academy at West Point. Up to 1840, even up to 1850, 
nearly all the civil engineers had received their preparation in this military school. 
From its establishment in 1802 up to 1862 it prepared about 2,000 students; of these 
200 became civil engineers and about 230 entered the military Engineer Corps. 
Among the former number are the most renowned civil engineers of the country. 
The interesting history of this military school has been written by Gen. G. W. 
Cullum in the Biographical Register of the Officers and Graduates of the United 
States Military Academy. Charles B. Stuart, in his Lives and Works of the Civil and 
Military Engineers of America, gives information concerning American engineers of. 
the old times. The following table, taken from Cullum’s Register, proves the great 
influence this school has had, and gives the professions which its former students 
selected. The students who, from 1802 till 1890, entered civil service are grouped as

During the first few years of its existence the Academy at West Point was of no 
importance, but after its reorganization through Colonel Thayer it rose to great 
prominence. The requirements for admission were and are still very low; they con- 
sist in an examination in reading, writing, arithmetic, English grammar, geography, 
and history of the United States; but the examination for admission and the whole 
course of four years are conducted in reality with great rigor. 
Between the years 1880 and 1888 only 2 per cent of the students were admitted to 
the Engineer Corps of the United States. Service in this Corps requires an additional 
study of two years and a half in the United States School for Engineers at Willets 
Point, Long Island, organized in 1885. The technical instruction in this school com- 
prises twenty-two weeks in civil engineering, ten weeks in military engineering, 
nineteen weeks in chemistry and photography, and forty weeks in science of explo- 
sives and torpedoes.

  660 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Since the beginning of the sixties the Military Academy at West Point has lost 
some of its importance with reference to education of practical civil engineers. The 
number and importance of engineering schools pure and proper haye become very 
great, and the enormous development of this branch has necessitated a division of 
labor. The Military Academy at West Point has, in fact,educated for service in 
civil life only civil engineers. For the education of mechanical engineers this 
Academy has not contributed much; but, on the other hand, anumber of the mechan- 
ical engineers have come from the Naval Academy at Annapolis. 
This Academy was founded in 1845; it had at first a three-years course of study 
and three years of actual service on board ship. This service was distributed 
throughout the course, thus making the course last six years. In 1851 the school 
was newly organized, with a four-years uninterrupted course, followed by actual 
service aboard ship. In 1861, at the outbreak of the civil war, the Academy was 
transferred to the city of Newport; but in 1865 it went back to its old quarters and 
was subjected to the supervision of the Bureau of Navigation, Navy Department. 
According to its present organization the school admits one naval cadet for every 
Representative in Congress; the cadet must be in age between 15 and 20. The 
requirements for admission are, like those of the Military Academy, rather low (read- 
ing, writing, arithmetic, algebra, grammar, geography, and history of the United 
States), but the examination is a very severe one. One of the requirements is that 
the candidate is obliged to serve eight years in the Navy (including the years of 
study). The course is one of four years at present, and it is well adapted for the 
education of mechanical engineers; so that it happens quite frequently that the 
students devote themselves to service in civil life after they have completed their 
required service in the Navy. For the completion of the study in machine building 
the mechanical engineers in this school may enter upon an additional course in New 
York; this course has been arranged in connection with the Naval Arsenal. 
A large number of renowned American mechanical engineers are graduates of 
Annapolis: Francis B. Allen, vice-president of the boiler company at Hartford, 
Conn.; R. H. Thurston, professor at Sibley College; B. F. Isherwood, the well- 
known experimenter and marine engineer; B. C. Bampton, director of the Pacific 
Mail Steamship Company; James T. Boyd, superintendent of the Blake Manufactur- 
ing Company, at East Cambridge, Mass.; Charles E. Emery, engineer in New York; 
David M. Greene, engineer in Troy, formerly president of the Rensselaer Polytechnic 
Institute; J. C. Kafer, superintendent of the Morgan Iron Works, New York; E. D. 
Leavitt, engineer at Cambridgeport, Mass.; Charles H. Manning, superintendent of 
the anoniceas Manufacturing Company, Manchester, N. H.; Charles D. Bray, pro- 
fessor in Tufts College; A. R. Bush, engineer of the Geer Electric Company, 
Boston; M. E. Cooley, professor, University of Michigan; W. F. Durand, professor 
at Cornell University; I. N. Hollis, professor at Harvard University; A. M. Mattice, 
engineer with E. D. Leavitt; H. W. Spangler, professor, University of Pennsyl- 
vania; O. B. Shallenberger, engineer of the Westinghouse Electric Company, Pitts- 
burg, Pa.; B. H. Warren, superintendent of the Yale & Towne Manufacturing 
Company, Stamford, Conn.; Edgar Penney, superintendent of the Frick Company, 
Waynesboro, Pa.; G. Westinghouse, jr., the inventor of the air brake and president 
of the various Westinghouse companies; and a great number of other manufac- 
turers, engineers, and railroad directors. 
OLD ENGINEERING SCHOOLS. 
The oldest polytechnical school is the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, 
N. Y., founded by Stephen Van Rensselaer, in 1824. He erected the buildings and 
endowed the school with a large land grant. In its charter the term ‘engineering 
school” is not mentioned; it only says that the school shall ‘offer to farmers, 
mechanics, physicians, lawyers, and merchants opportunity to become practically 
scientific.” At first the institution was confined to experimental courses in the
-P-A-G-E-671
  AMERICAN TECHNOLOGICAL SCHOOLS, 661 
natural sciences. Four years after the opening the catalogue of the school mentions 
“engineering” as one of the branches of study. 
The original course of study in 1826 contained a preparatory department, with a 
peculiar method of instruction called the ‘‘Rensselaer method,” which became typ- 
ical for America. The instruction was given in the morning in the form of lectures, 
and in the afternoon it was continued by instructive conversation, The requirements 
for admission were age (13 to 14 years) and an examination in reading, writing, 
arithmetic, and English grammar. 
Thepreparatory department had four divisions: (1) Botany and entomology. Occu- 
pation: Collections of minerals, plants, and insects. (2) Geography and history. 
Occupation: In summer, physiology of plants, microscopic investigations; in winter, 
tho making of a globe of plaster of paris. (3) Elements of practical mathematics ~ 
and moral philosophy. Occupation: In summer, surveying and hydraulic experi- 
ments; in winter, the making and using of mechanical tools, measurements. (4) 
Logic and rhetoric. Occupation: In summer, experiments with gases; in winter, the 
manufacture and application of electric batteries, galvanometers, magnets, etc. 
(5) Principles of government and parliamentary usage. Occupation: The manu- 
facture of sundials, thermometers, hygrometers, determining meridians, specific 
weight, the use of the soldering iron and blowpipe, of cameras, the making of 
optical pictures by means of lenses, explanation of the microscope and telescope, 
the application of the laws of reflection and refraction of light by common mirrors 
and water vessels, and, lastly, the separation of the colored beams of light by means 
of ice prisms. In all these exercises and occupations the students were allowed to 
use only tools and apparatus which they had made themselves. 
In the school itself the students of engineering were at first taught the natural 
sciences, to wit, botany (three weeks), zoology (four weeks), geology (three and 
one-half weeks), chemistry (ten weeks). The real technical instruction embraced 
knowledge of instruments for survey and physics (eight weeks); geometry, bridge 
building, railroad and canal construction (eight weeks); hydraulics (four weeks) ; 
the application of steam, wind, and electro-magnetism, construction and geology 
(four weeks). 
Up to 1845 only 2 professors and 2 assistants for the science of engineering. were 
employed; in 1849 a professor of chemistry was added; in 1849 the school was thor- 
oughly remodeled and received a foundation which has remained the same till 
to-day. The Rensselaer Institute has since become one of the best schools for civil 
engineering. The greatest number of the renowned hydraulic and railroad engineers 
of America are graduates of this school. Up to 1850 the Rensselaer Institute and 
the Military Academy at West Point were the only engineering schools of impor- 
tance. Hence we see that well-arranged instruction in the technical sciences is much 
younger in America than in Europe, where, at the beginning of our century, techno- 
logical instruction was offered in France and Germany by means of industrial and 
trade schools; in Austria by means of polytechnical institutes at Prague and 
Vienna. During the forties the importance of the engineering arts increased in the 
United States, and with it the necessity of founding polytechnical schools. The fol- 
lowing were founded in quick succession: In 1845 the school of engineering of Union 
College in Schenectady, N. Y., and the Polytechnical Institute in Brooklyn; in 1846 
the Lawrence Scientific School, a department of Harvard University; in 1847 the 
Sheffield Scientific School of Yale University, founded by Mr. Sheffield, with an 
endowment of $1,000,000, at first only nominally an engineering school, but since 
1860 remarkably successful; in 1852 the engineering department of the University of 
Michigan, Ann Arbor. 
The large sums which Harvard and Yale universities received for educational pur- 
poses are noteworthy; in the foundation of numerous other schools such benefactions 
were repeated, and they all are significant of American public spirit. In this con- 
nection I may mention the fact that the foundation of the University of Michigan  
-P-A-G-E-672
  662 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
took place at a time (1817) when the State was still a Territory with scarcely 7,000 
inhabitants, all simple backwoodsmen. The charter determined the establishment 
of nine divisions: ‘General sciences, literature, mathematics, natural sciences, medi- 
cine, ethical, historical, intellectual, and military science.” The school for mechan- 
ical engineering, added in the year 1859, and belonging to the department of science, 
lay too remote from the centers of industrial activity in the country, and hence never 
flourished. 
In 1851 the Chandler School of Science of Dartmouth College was founded. In 
1867 General Thayer added to it the Thayer School of Engineering. With Dart- 
mouth College the New Hampshire College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts had 
also been connected. These schools may be considered the forerunners of the poly- 
technical schools established later, though they themselves did not gain importance 
till 1860. 
Harvard and Yale universities had the most abundant means, professors for many 
sciences, libraries, etc., but they did not understand the importance of technological 
education ; they never reached the perfection which the Rensselaer Institute in Troy or 
the military schools attained, and they were soon left in the rear after the establish- 
ment of new polytechnical schools. ‘The abundant income of these old universities 
was used for other branches of study. It is instructive to note the establishment 
of the Lawrence Scientific School. It may serve as a significant example. 
The old Harvard University, which was founded in 1636, in Cambridge, near Bos- 
ton, was enriched in 1846 by the establishment of the Lawrence Scientific School. It 
was done by Abbott Lawrence, with a donation of $100,000 in land. Mr. Lawrence 
was interested in the hydraulic works in Lawrence, which city had been named after 
him. The letter proposing the gift is remarkable in many respects, for it determined 
clearly and distinctly Mr. Lawrence’s aim and purpose. It must be remembered 
that it was done nearly fifty years ago. ‘Where can we send those who intend to 
devote themselves to the practical applications of science? How educate our engi- 
neers, our miners, machinists, and mechanics?” Now, with regard to these classes of 
persons he said: ‘Inventive men laboriously reinvent what has been produced 
before. Ignorant men fight against the laws of nature with a vain energy, and pur- 
chase their experience at great cost. Why should not all these start where their 
predecessors ended, and not where they began? Education can enable them to do so. 
The application of science to the useful arts has changed, in the last half century, 
the condition and relations of the world.” The letter suggested that instruction 
should be given in (1) engineering; (2) mining engineering, including metallurgy ; 
(3) inventing and constructing machinery. All three departments should have a 
basis of uniform, general study, and only in the latter years of the course should 
the trifurcation take place. The document contains the explicit recommendation 
“that the whole income of this school be devoted to the acquisition, illustration, 
and dissemination of the practical sciences forever.” 
These principles are indeed the essential purposes of our present polytechnical 
schools, but at the time Mr. Lawrence uttered them they were new and unheard 
of, and give evidence of his discrimination and forethought. Further proof of this 
is: ‘(In addition to these [i. e., the regular professors], it would be necessary to 
obtain the services, at stated periods, of eminent men from the practical walks of 
life. The law school is taught by distinguished lawyers of the highest reputation. 
The medical school by distinguished physicians. In like manner, this school of 
science should number among its teachers men who have practiced and are practicing 
the arts they are called to teach.” These are remarkable words, not only for the 
time they were uttered, but for all time to come. Mr. Lawrence was active as a 
public man from 1847 till 1855, went in 1849 to England as ambassador, and died 
in 1855. 
It appears that Harvard University did not appreciate Lawrence’s gift, and used 
it for other purposes. It is true that at the beginning a professorship of the engi- 
neering sciences was established, but in 1855 it was abandoned. In 1842 Louis Agassiz
-P-A-G-E-673
  AMERICAN TECHNOLOGICAL SCHOOLS. . 663 
had come to Cambridge as professor of zoology. There was great enthusiasm about 
him, and it was determined to secure his services permanently; for this reason the 
income of the Lawrence School was used for the promotion of zoology and the estab- 
lishment of a museum of comparative zoology. In consequence of this engineering 
and other scientific branches were neglected, an experience which other universities, 
with renowned but one-sided professors, haye made also, Harvard University, 
which, by following Lawrence’s advice, might have become the first and best organ- 
ized technological institution, is not counted to-day among the engineering schools. 
The requirements for admission in the Lawrence Scientific School were at the 
beginning lower than they were for Harvard University; moreover they were quite 
indefinite; candidates were required to have a good English education, qualified to 
pursue to advantage the courses prescribed, and to have good moral character. 
The second mistake made in carrying out Lawrence’s ideas lay in the original 
course of study, which prescribed exclusively abstract sciences. The decline of the 
Lawrence School began, therefore, soon after its foundation, and as early as the close 
of the fifth decade it was quite insignificant. The annual report of 1859 speaks 
only of purchases for the department of zoology; not a word of the engineering 
department. | 
How erroneous the policy of Harvard University, and how correct the views of 
Lawrence were, is seen from oe enormous growth during the sixth decade of purely    
    technological institutions founded in the immediate neighborhood of the Lawrence 
School with much more modest means. They assumed the leadership, and haye 
remained at the head of the column to this day with great success. 
THE LAND-GRANT BILL. 
The foregoing offers a glance into the origin of American engineering schools up 
to the beginning of the sixties, though many interesting details have been omitted. 
In 1862 an entirely changed condition was created by the passage of the famous 
“Jand-grant bill.” The number of technological institutions increased enormously 
in consequence of this law, and their present condition is probably only the begin- 
ning of a future development of technological instruction in America, 
The land-grant bill was brought in by Senator Morrill, of Vermont, during the 
saddest part of the civil war; it was passed by both Houses of Congress and signed 
by President Lincoln July 2, 1862. This law prescribed that every State should 
receive 30,000 acres of Jand for educational purposes for every Representative in Con- 
gress, the land to have no known mineral veins. The land granted to a State should, 
if possible, lie within its boundaries if sufficient land valued at $1.25 per acre was 
still at the disposal of the Government; if not, then the State should receive land 
in some other State which it was obliged to sell. Possession of land by a State in 
any other State was expressly forbidden in order to avoid complications of interests. 
This latter passage was interpreted by many States as an order for immediate sale 
and the land thus granted in other States was squandered at low prices in the 
midst of the civil war. Some States considered it admissible to deed the land over 
to certain schools for subsequent sale, and only these States have derived the intended 
benefit from the law. The senseless squandering referred to can only be explained 
by the excitement prevailing during the war when the future of the Union was 
questioned. 
The law also determined that the income from the sale of this land should be used 
in every State for the establishment and maintenance of at least one school. Concern- 
ing the kind of schools, it was determined ‘to teach such braiiches of learning as 
are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts in order to promote the liberal and 
practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions 
in life.” This provision, however, did not exclude scientific or classical studies. 
Each State was obliged to establish such a.school within five years from the pas- 
sage of the law, and every State complied with this provision. Massachusetts 
founded two schools from the proceeds of the grant, the Institute of Technology  
-P-A-G-E-674

and the Agricultural College; while in New York, Michigan, Vermont, and Connec- 
ticut the grant was transferred to existing institutions or universities. 
Particnlars concerning the history of this grant are found in a publication by the 
Bureau of Education in Washington, entitled The History of Federal and State Aid 
to Higher Education in the United States; also in a publication of Cornell Uni- 
versity, entitled History of the Agricultural College Land Grant. The following

Altogether there were 9,567,840 acres, equivalent to $15,865,872, or an average of 
$1.60 per acre. % 
What small prices the majority of the States obtained from the sale is seen from 
the foregoing table; only 9 States secured more than the price set by the Govern- 
ment, that is, $1.25 per acre; 11 States squandered the land for less than one-half 
the normal price; among these are Pennsylvania (52 cents per acre), New Hampshire 
(53 cents), New York (53 cents), Ohio (54 cents), Maine (56 cents), Massachusetts 
(56 cents). New York received altogether about 10 per cent of the entire grant, and 
nearly one-half of the entire proceeds. This must not be credited to the State, but 
to Mr. Ezra Cornell. The State of New York had begun to sell its land at very low 
prices, but then surrendered to Mr. Cornell the further administration and he pro- 
eured a better result. 
If other States had acted likewise, the sum of $58,000,000 might have been pro- 
cured instead of only $9,600,000, or 16 per cent. Nearly $48,000,000 were lost by 
want of circumspection and care in the administration of the grant, hence the pur- 
pose of this munificent provision for schools, which in the history of education is 
without parallel, was attained only to a limited extent. In New York a contention 
arose, because|the money was to be divided among several schools. Through the 
energy of A. D. White and E, Cornell, both State senators, a division of the fund 
was prevented. Cornell declared that if the entire proceeds of the grant were 
applied to the support of the new university at Ithaca, he would place half a mil- 
lion dollars of his own at its disposal. This was accepted. Cornell held back the 
assignment of land until he could procure better prices, and then made new propo- 
sitions. He guaranteed the State 60 cents per acre, if the land was sold within 
twenty years, and the surplus was given over to Cornell University. Mr. Cornell 
died in 1872; his successor, Henry W. Sage, adopted the same policy, and in conse- 
quence the university at Ithaca has become one of the richest and best endowed 
universities in the land—an institution which in many respects may be considered 
a model of the modern current of education. Its departments of engineering are 
considered equal in value with all its other departments, and the authorities have 
given them an ever-growing attention the more the engineering branches increased 
in importance. 
  MODERN ENGINEERING SCHOOLS. 
In consequence of the land-grant bill numerous scientific institutions of learning 
were either established or greatly improved. The greatest number of them are tech- 
nological institutions. The number at present can not be definitely stated, since 
many of them are in quite an undeveloped state. The Bureau of Education mentions, 
in its report of 1889, 141 scientific schools that offer an education to engineers. Of 
these many offer at present little or no technological education, but have the inten- 
tion of establishing that department later. On the other hand, there are real tech- 
nological institutions in existence not contained in that list of 141 institutions; 
-hence I omit that list and resort to Wellington’s tables. 
The first list contains all the important institutions of outspoken technological 
character, giving the year of the establishment and the departments of engineering.

  AMERICAN TECHNOLOGICAL SCHOOLS. 667 
All the institutions mentioned in this list, with the exception of the Pennsylvania 
State College, have received support from the land grant mentioned. Forty-five of 
them give instruction in civil engineering, 31 in machine building, 23 in electro-tech- 
nology, 18 in mining engineering. ‘Ten schools offer exclusively civil engineering, 3 
exclusively machine building or mechanical engineering, 2 exclusively mining engi- 
neering. Schools for electro-technology exclusively do not exist. Forty-one, a 
majority of the 52 engineering schools enumerated, aredepartments of universities; 
only 11 are independent institutions. 
Several of the larger cngireering schools recently established, for instance the 
Leland Stanford Junior University, in California, have not been inserted, since their 
establishment is of too recent date and their technological instruction is yet too 
insignificant, but I suspect that these younger schools will soon surpass the older 
ones in the departments of mechanical engineering and electro-technology. 
The second list contains the other institutions of learning that have been estab- 
lished by means of the land-grant act. They give instruction of some kind in tech- 
nology, but have not developed into complete engineering schools.

[After thus briefly giving a general and historical survey of the growth and extent 
of American technological schools, the author proceeds to state the purposes and 
organization of the leading schools, quoting from their catalogues and other publi- 
cations. Since these may be obtained on application from the several schools, this

part of Professor Riedler’s report is here omitted. He then proceeds to show what 
amount of preparation these schools require, and he does that, as the reader will see, 
in a very pleasingly graphic manner. ] 
REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMISSION IN AMERICAN TECHNOLOGICAL INSTITUTIONS. - 
Requirements for admission in the various institutions are as different as the insti- 
tutions themselves. <A general criticism is difficult, because we have to judge by the 
printed statements of the requirements, while the true standard of criticism would 
be the degree of severity or laxity in their enforcement. 
All institutions require an examination for admission by means of which the differ- 
ent degrees of preparation of the students are equalized. The enforcement of the 
requirement of examination is not everywhere alike; it is said to be very rigorous 
in classical universities, but allows even there some gradation and makes possible 
admission into one of the lower departments of the university. Through the back- 
doors of various departments almost everyone may get admission to a university; 
the lower gates simply lead to the preparatory department which is most always 
found connected with a university. But also the requirements themselves differ 
greatly in different parts of the country. Schools situated in the Southern or West- 
ern States demand less, and of course accomplish less, than others; in most cases their 
students would not be admitted to renowned schools of enginéering. 
There is scarcely a difference in the requirements for admission between Harvard, 
Yale, and Cornell. As a rule the technological schools require no knowledge of 
ancient languages, except the Sheffield School in Yale. The latter is the only engi- 
neering school which allows students to enter at 15 years of age; the majority of 
schools have fixed the lower limit of age at 16 or 17. A regular student of the Shef- 
field School can enter Cornell only as a special student (hospitant), since he is not 
considered able to take part in the regular instruction. The requirements grouped 
in the accompanying chart are collected from the catalogues of 48 engineering schools; 
the chart will be more instructive than an extensive description would be (see p. 669). 
The chart does not contain those branches which are required exceptionally by a 
few schools only. For instance, higher demands in French and German. are made 
only by 1 school (Stevens Institute); bookkeeping is required in 1 school (Colum- 
bia College); rhetoric in 5 schools. The summary shows that nearly all schools 
require English and algebra, plane geometry, and American history; other branches, 
especially natural sciences, are required by comparatively few schools. Renowned 
institutions like Rensselaer and the military schools require nominally very little, 
and many another school of little distinetion requires much. Several mining engi- 
neering schools not contained in the chart do not even require English; one only 
mathematics; some agricultural schools, not inserted in the chart, require nothing 
but English. 
     
  LENGTH OF COURSES. 
In almost all engineering schools of the United States the course is one of four 
years; only6 schools have one of three years, and 3 schools one of five years; the 
latter are the University of Pennsylvania, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and the 
Polytechnic School of St. Louis. But even these schools graduate their students at 
the expiration of the fourth year, except that of St. Louis. 
The number of weeks in a school year varies between thirty-two and forty; the 
average is thirty-eight weeks, or a total of one hundred and fifty-two weeks in four 
years. Schools with shorter courses require work in vacation. 
Many schools consider a four-years course too short, hence arrange for post-grad- 
uate courses in railroad engineering, technology of hygiene, city waterworks, and 
architecture. The 6 schools that have a three-years course each may be considered 
exceptions. They give either no laboratory instruction, like the Sheffield School in 
Yale, or require a longer preparation, like the Thayer School; or try to equalize the 
difference by a better utilization of the time devoted to exercises. The control of

attendance is regular and strict. Although the majority of catalogues contain this 
passage: ‘Tho students are treated as men, not as boys,” the term ‘‘boys” is gen- 
erally used for students. 
A comparison of the various programmes shows that one lecture or recitation hour 
is considered equal to three hours in the workshop, two and a haif hours in the 
laboratory, and two hours devoted to drawing. According to this estimate, the 
average length of instruction is only fifteen to twenty hours per week. Five schools 
demand twenty to twenty-five hours, four schools more than thirty hours, and three 
schools thirty-five to thirty-seven hours per week. The ratio of lectures, work in 
laboratory, drawing, and shopwork to the entire instruction is as follows: 55 per 
cent lectures, 35 per cent laboratory, 10 per cent drawing and shopwork. The first 
number increases to 70 per cent in engineering schools which are not well provided 
with shops and laboratories. The length of the course and the division of time for 
lectures, laboratory, and shopwork prevailing in some of the noted schools is stated 
in the following char

    ACADEMIC DEGREES. 
All American engineering schools confer upon their students academic degrees 
after the completion of the course, following in this the example of the old uniyersi- 
ties; quite unimportant schools do the same. The academic title is given either 
after the completion of the regular course, or upon a dissertation on some technical 
problem, or, in some cases, after the completion of a post-graduate course of one 
year in special branches. 
According to the report of the Bureau of Education, there are 28 different aca- 
demic degrees conferred in the United States; among them are 8in science, 5 in letters, 
 
-P-A-G-E-681
AMERICAN TECHNOLOGICAL SCHOOLS. 671 
4 in philosophy, 2 in art, 2 in theology, 3 in medicine, and 2 in laws. The degrees 
given to engincers are contained among the degrees in science. As early as 1888, 
216 schools conferred about 1,600 degrees in science; in 1893 about 200 engineering 
schools alone conferred over 2,000 degrees upon engineers. 
The lowest degree, B. S. (bachelor of science), transferred to the engineering 
branch is B. M. E., B. C. E., B. E. E.—that is, bachelor of mechanical engineering, 
civil engineering, and electric engineering. The grade M. S. (master of science), 
transferred to the engineering branches, is M. E., C. E., E. E., and hence signifies 
simply engineer in one of the three branches. Aside from these thero are a number 
of subtitles, such as topographical engineer, sanitary engineer, and mining engincer, 
and finally there are the degrees of doctors of engineering, science doctors, and philo- 
sophical doctors. The latter title is borne by many distinguished engineers, although 
their colleagues express astonishment over the fact. 
Degrees are not considered of much importance in America; they are too numer- 
ous, and have fallen into discredit because they were conferred by schools of no 
standing. Vanity has much to do with it. Unbiased observers will not consider 
the imitation of the ancient title of master of science a very happy one. Welling- 
ton says that conferring such a degree is telling a lie, and the lie is not made more 
respectable because it is told on parchment and signed by the authorities of the 
school. 
The practical importance of academic degrees in America is small, especially for 
engineers, They have no observable influence upon the schools that grant them. 
It is different with the old universities, which are influenced very much by the study 
for academic degrees and the examinations they require. The injurious results of 
studying for degrees shown in the publication of ‘‘ Matriculation guides,” “ Keys to 
the classics,” “‘ History made easy,” ‘Examination Latin grammar,” and various 
“Extracts,” begin to play an important réle in higher education. | 
With reference to the profession of engineering it may be stated that the academic 
degrees haye nowhere had the only favorable result which academic degrees can 
have, namely, the elevation of the profession. This result is not possible, owing to 
the arbitrary way in which they are conferred. The instruction in engineerin. 
schools has remained free from the injurious influence resulting from working for 
examinations and degre 
      8, except in very rare cases. 
COST OF THE INSTRUCTION. r 
A good technological education is very expensive, since it can only be given by 
experienced engineers, who demand high salaries; it requires also very elaborate 
apparatus and considerable current expenses. The fact that the means of instruc- 
tion are expensive is the cause of so many engineering schools in America being 
insufficiently equipped and unable to accomplish what they promise. This is particu- 
larly true of numerous schools of recent origin in the West. Such poorly equipped 
schools teach the engineering sciences in the same way in which they teach literary 
branches, and frequently we find that one and the same professor teaches mathe- 
matics and physics, engineering sciences, and languages; perhaps also manual 
training. Insuch schools they teach what can be learned from books. Why not the 
engineering sciences? Engaging experienced talent and equipping schools with 
expensive apparatus is not thought necessary, and is often deprecated by the repre- 
sentatives of the classics.

It is impossible to conduct the department for a smaller sum than that without 
crippling it. Professors who understand their business well are very expensive in 
America, because in practical life a good and sufficient income is always at their 
disposal. The greatest difficulty in American schools is to secure and hold such 
men, and the difficulty becomes greater in proportion to the work with which these 
men are burdened. In Sibley College, Director Thurston alone has to conduct the 
entire instruction in the senior class, and this is, considering the American mode of 
teaching and the expensive laboratory work, an enormous amount of work. 
As a rule, the teachers have a fixed salary, but they are also dependent upon their 
share of the tuition fees. In the university at Ann Arbor, Mich., the professors 
have an average salary of $2,200,.the assistant professors $1,600, and tutors $900. 
The managers of universities do not like to pay a professor of the engineering 
sciences any more than they pay to other professors; the consequence of this is that 
the chairs have been filled with young graduates and that the number of tutors or 
assistants without experience is exceedingly high in comparison to that of the 
regular professors, a fact which is certainly not advantageous to the school. Of 
late the example of medical schools has been imitated; it is that of inducing dis- 
tinguished specialists to devote a part of their time to lecturing. In large cities 
the professors of engineering sciences are already, as a rule, engineers who are active 
outside of the school in practical pursuits. This is advantageous to both parties, 
provided sufficient time is given for the instruction. The school makes serviceable 
the practical experience of the professor, and the professor remains abreast with the 
times and is enabled to test his theories in practical problems. The students gain 
more confidence in their teachers, and follow their instruction with greater interest. 
The enormous expenditures in conducting engineering schools require either a 
very large number of students or large funds. Most schools depend upon fees, even 
such schools as those at Troy and Boston. They charge fees as high as $200 per year. 
Others charge fees despite sufficient funds, like Cornell University; but in this case 
it is done to limit the number of students. The technological department of the 
university (Sibley College) charges $150, while the classical department is satisfied 
with a fee of $75. The Columbia College of Mines in New York also, though in pos- 
session of very large means, demands a fee of $200, the majority of engineering 
schools $150 to $200. However, in some of the best schools instruction is almost 
free. Most of the schools mentioned before (see list) can not support themselves; 
every student costs between $400 and $500 more than he pays, if the attendance does 
not go beyond 50 to 70 students. In these cases the generous public spirit mentioned 
before furnishes the means for the support of the schools.

The fees are very low in all State universities, being between $10 and $50. In 
Lehigh attendance was entirely free of cost up to the year 1891; it is also free in the 
Leland Stanford Junior University in Palo Alto, in the University of Kansas, Kansas 
Agricultural College, in the universities of Minnesota, Illinois, Cincinnati, Nebraska, 
and Alabama, in the Mining School of Colorado, in the Pennsylvania State College, 
in the Georgia School of Technology, in the State College of Kentucky, and the 
Virginia Military Institute. But instruction is free in the first three and the last 
three mentioned only for native or naturalized citizens of the respective States. 
The personal expenditures of a student, aside from tuition fees, books and, instruc- 
tion, vary considerably. They are between $200 and $700 per annum. In schools 
not situated in large cities the average expenditure for maintenance is about $200 to 
$300. The following table will show a comparative summary of the costs of 
several of the larger schools:

  Times have changed greatly since the foundation of the first American engineer- 
ing schools. In 1840 the tuition fee in the Rensselaer School at Troy was $1.50 for 
a course of three weeks, and $1.59 per week for board in the school; no further 
expenses for the use of laboratories were demanded. In Harvard University the 
entire annual expenditures of a student, previous to 1848, amounted to $100; at 
present they amount to $500 to $600. The university itself states the minimum to 
be $372, the average to be $470 to $620. It must be remembered that the conditions 
in Harvard University are unusually favorable, and its institutions are imitated in 
many other schools of science. x 
The students of Harvard University find in Memorial Hall board and lodging, 
with three meals a day, for $4.25 per week; the Foxcroft Club charges between $2.50 
and $3.50. In Memorial Hall the meals are taken in common. This hall has been 
founded by a bequest, and contains a large assembly hall, a hall of entertainment, 
which as a rule serves as a dining hall for from 1,200 to 1,400 students. However, 
there is no compulsion for students to take part in the public meals. Similar arrange- 
ments are found in all the large universities in America, and dwelling rooms are 
usually connected with them. The prices differ according to location. For wealthy 
students special dwellings and buildings may be had, and at the great dinner table 
of Harvard there is, curiously enough, a special part set off for such students. 
The salaries of university professors are much better than they are in England, 
where a few professors draw princely salaries, but where the majority are paid 
poorly. For instance, the professor of. English literature in University College in 
London has a salary of $265. Generally speaking, the means at the disposal of

English universities are small in comparison with the American. The State is very 
economical with its subsidies, and follows the principle laid down by the former 
chancellor of exchequer, Mr. Goshen: ‘‘ Nothing for bread and butter, only for 
sciences that can not support themselves.” ‘The annual subsidy paid by the State to 
the large University College amounts to only $8,500. 
The benefactions of private citizens, with which the American schools are so 
liberally endowed, are almost entirely wanting in England. A collection had to be 
taken for the newly opened electrical laboratory of the University College in Lon- 
don, in order to raise the required $2,500, Industry in England also shows less 
interest for the technological schools than in America; and it is considered quite 
a proof of liberality when the managers of a machine factory give a discount of 
30 per cent for machines and instruments used for school purposes. 
[Nore.—The author here inserts notes concerning the most essential facts with

GENERAL REVIEW OF AMERICAN ENGINE: 
  ERING SCHOOLS, 
Owing to the exceedingly large number and varied character of American poly- 
technical schools, it is impossible to offer a description of their organization and 
management wholly without criticism and at the same time in a measure complete. 
The one thing possible has been done in the foregoing; that is, in a description of a 
number of selected schools the essential features that characterize the instruction 
and fundamental conception of the objects of technological instruction have been 
sketched. 
{Norr.—As has been stated, this portion of the report has been omitted in the 
translation.] 
To complete the picture a few general comparative remarks may seem desirable. 
Regarding the education of engineers in earlier years the following remarks may be 
added. 
The military schools do not serve the profession of civil and mechanical engineer- 
ing any longer. The times in which mainly knowledge of mathematics, geometry, 
and geodesy were considered sufficient for the profession of engineers have passed, 
and to-day there is no engineering school which does not seek its main work in 
extensive professional instruction. 
Nevertheless, the military schools, with the peculiar education and rather limited 
theoretical and practical instruction for civil and mechanical engineers they offer, are 
of great importance. We find the proof of this in the great number of distinguished 
civil engineers who have graduated from such schools. This holds good not only 
for America, but for other countries. With us the course of education of a Werner- 
Siemens may induce us to deep reflection. 
In face of the present enormous development in exact knowledge of scientific and 
technical details, the actual result of the study is dependent now as formerly upon 
simple, natural conception, clearness, and thoroughness, but not upon the extent of 
knowledge. Military schools in this respect offer many advantages, The most dis- 
tinguished technological school of France also is a military institution. If a nega- 
tive advantage of these schools is the prevention of knowing and learning too many 
things, then the strict formation of character, the reliability and independence 
gained, must be a positive advantage that can not be gauged too high. Alas, many 
a modern school esteems that advantage too little. 
The preparation of engineers as private students of practical civil engineers 
deserves the same consideration. This mode of education has become rare; we still 
find it only in England; but an education obtained in this way is very valuable, 
and always more profitable and animated than if it had been obtained through 
books and in schools. The reason has been mentioned before; such students do not 
obtain the science so much as the art of engineering, and this chiefly through their 
own reflection, Another reason is that the instruction results from intercourse with
-P-A-G-E-685

a distinguished experienced engineer, and that, with experience in actual work, a 
correct conception, practical view, independence, and a feeling of responsibility are 
developed. And in these, all extensive school education to the contrary notwith- 
standing, we find the essential character of a true engineering education which 
facilitates the entrance into practical life—the step which is often so abrupt and 
disastrous becomes almost unnoticeable. 
Real comprehension and an animated activity does not begin for our university 
students until they have emancipated themselves from what is known as the school 
tone, have forgotten their school science, and have placed in their stead fruitful 
suggestions of creating minds andindependentaction. The intellectual and scientific 
education of the present schools does not suffice; this is everywhere noticeable in 
the pitiable condition of persons who, after finishing their school duties, lack guidance 
and the example of renowned professional men. They run into grooves and the 
world of productive and creative activity remains closed to them. In America inde- 
pendent action is valued much higher than with us. 
It may be remarked here parenthetically that the engineers who have acted as 
pioneers and smoothed out the road of progress are widely known and highly esteemed 
in America and England. It is our peculiarity on the otherhand to treat with little 
esteem the works of predecessors in the field of technology; to view with indiffer- 
ence those men upon whose shoulders we have arisen to higher altitudes. The 
pioneer engineers in Germany are almost unknown to our students, and to the great 
public they are not known at all. In America and England, also in France, their 
remembrance is kept alive; it penetrates into the masses of the people and is. utilized 
for ideal purposes of education. Numerous publications glorify and extel the services 
these men have rendered, while we do not even offer to the younger generation a 
comprehensive biography of such men; we do not erect literary monuments for 
them that may be compared with those in American and English literature. ‘A close 
connection between the historical development of the engineering sciences and the 
education of engineers is lacking with us altogether. 
The older American universities which furnished an education for engineers previ- 
ous to 1862 have not justified the peculiar object of such an education. Harvard . 
University did not, as stated before, clearly understand the object and importance 
of an engineer’s education, although it had the facilities. Harvard and the old clas- 
sical Yale University have underestimated their engineering departments from the — 
very beginning; they have lowered the requirements for admission, and introduced 
into the course of study beside abstract instruction only insignificant professional 
instruction. They have neglected to follow up the progress of the engineering 
sciences. Hence their engineering schools have remained insignificant up to late 
years. Smaller schools have far surpassed them, and of late these old universities 
have prepared but few engineers. 
These old universities meet the demands so little that the actual needs of life 
created new engineering schools, even previous to the land-grant act. The Massa- 
chusetts Institute of Technology and the Stevens Institute in Hoboken prove this. 
Since the passage of the land-grant act in 1862 the education of engineers has more 
and more withdrawn from the universities and turned to the independent profes- 
sional schools, which at present offer that kind of education almost exclusively. 
The first consequence of the land-grant aet, an act without a parallel, was a rapid 
waste of the gigantic means offered; the second was the establishment of more than 
200 schools, which are chiefly technological—a few of them are agricultural schools, 
Most of them are poorly equipped and organized without much reflection, yet many 
of these technological schools had to go through many changes in the course of time, 
and the majority of them are still in the process of development. 
It must be noted that most of the modern schools, which are undoubted techno- 
logical schools, and have accomplished much as such, were founded as integral parts 
of universities. 
   
-P-A-G-E-686
  676 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Church influence has played an inferior réle in the establishment of such schools, 
while in the establishment of older universities it made itself felt occasionally. As 
late as 1870 some cases occurred in which denominational influence decided the selec- 
tion of professors. It is alleged that such influence is still active in Yale University; 
a similar case is that of the newly founded Chicago University, where church inter- 
ests (Baptist) play a leading part.'! Generally speaking, church influence in the 
schools of America is insignificant at the present time, and for renowned engineer- 
ing schools it does not exist. Many of the recently established schools expressly 
exclude denominational teaching and influence. 
This is the more noteworthy since the English universities that have served the 
American as examples show an endless chain of ecclesiastical influence. The dis- 
putes in Cambridge and Oxford are well known; the establishment of the free Uni- 
versity of London was answered by the establishment of the High Church King’s 
College in London, and that the great University of London now only exists as an 
examining body and has sunk to the common level of a college is again attributable 
to church influence. 
At present America shows a strong movement for reform which aims at uniting all 
the engineering schools with the universities, in order thereby to increase the means, 
as well as to facilitate the instruction, and to connect with it shop and laboratory 
work, which are the essential characteristics of an American engineering education. 
After the example of other universities, these engineering schools are to be made of 
equal value with the schools for intellectual education or general culture and other 
branches of university education. But at the same time the attempt is made to 
establish preparatory schools for technological study, which, besides intellectual 
education, offer instruction for practical life and physical culture. 
Features peculiar to all engineering schools are extensive practical training, famil- 
iarity with practical views, and the development of the sense for investigation and 
observation by means of independent exercises in laboratories and workshops. This 
kind of instruction is carried through on a large scale in the modern technological 
schools of America, and has had a success which gives us occasion to reflect. 
In England attempts have been made to reorganize technological education in the 
direction intimated, but with the extremely limited means at the disposal of English 
technological schools scarcely noticeable results have been achieved. Only in 
electro-technology have England and Germany developed an instruction which 
resembles that of the American. 
Instruction proper, or at least the result of instruction outside of the laboratories— 
that is to say, the strictly scientitic and intellectual education in American techno- 
logical schools—does not exceed the average of a secondary industrial school in 
Austria, or the former Prussian schools of a similar kind. The education of stu- 
dents in construction is essentially lower. Instruction in drawing is actually little 
more than in name. Upon development of those faculties which are necessary for 
the successful work of construction very insufficient attention is hetowed; hence 
this side of the American technological education is correspondingly weak. 
In America no uniform organization of the course and method of instruction 
exists. The schools are entirely independent, and possess in some cases very excel- 
lent, but in small schools very poor equipment; in many cases schools are dependent 
upon their limited apparatus and the opinions of the students. The consequence is 
an extraordinary variety of kinds of schools representing an extended scale of value, 
The principles of instruction mentioned before are, however, followed by all 
engineering schools only so far as their equipment and facilities offer no obstacles. 
  
1Phis university, planned on a grand scale, has been founded by private means, and is under the control of the Baptists. It is intended to make this university the first and foremost of the land, for which reason munificent sums have been placed at its disposal; one of the founders, the New York millionaire, John D. Rockefeller, alone gave it the sum of $4,500,000. At present the university has faculties of art, literature, and sciences; but tho establishment of a superior technological depart- ment is planned.

} 
American schools of every kind lack the stimulus of valuable privileges such as we 
find in Germany, and only few professions are dependent upon a strictly prescribed 
course of study. \ 
In America the conviction is general that a complete education is not so much 
gained by instruction as by experience, and for the ‘‘school of experience” this 
American instruction, despite its great breaks and gaps in science and despite its 
deficiencies, furnishes more talented students than our schools, because American 
instruction (at least in the best schools) avoids the rock of overloading the brain 
with too many things, and creating superficiality. The main objects lie in the 
development of sense of observation, in simple and thorough conception, and in 
free development of natural talents. And again, the American schools are always 
inclined to do justice to changed conditions and new needs, and in late years they 
follow quickly the practical spirit of the nation. 
If the American school instruction were animated by better scientific spirit, and 
if in place of drawing, construction were taught in conformity with higher demands, 
it would, through its simplicity and naturalness, be far superior to our one-sided 
intellectual and theoretic education, which seems to extend over too great an area. _ 
Indulging in such comparisons, we must consider that the result of instruction in 
America is frequently prejudiced by the conditions of life without, which it is not in 
the power of the present schools to change. Their most formidable enemy is the 
tendency toward pecuniary gain; most young people rush out into the world to make 
money. This tendency injures the value of instruction as much as the diametrical 
opposite, timidity, injures the value of instruction as a factor of national welfare. 
Artificially developed timidity in practical pursuits and unlimited conceit in scien- 
tific methods are both consequences of learning too many things without reference 
to the demands of the actual world. These are our obstacles, while the tendency 
to gain money is the obstacle in America. 
Eyen in American secondary schools we find a great eagerness for independent 
livelihood. There is a great pressure for admission, but only a small percentage of 
the students really pursue earnest study; the other and greater part are satisfied to 
be able to say ‘“‘I entered college,” and then they leave to follow practical pursuits. 
Universities and professional schools are attended by many students only to the 
point where a chance invites for pecuniary gain. This is a serious obstacle for the 
scientific development of higher education, an obstacle which can not be overcome 
even by exalted aspirations on the part of the institutions and teachers, with model 
equipment for the pursuit of science at their disposal. 
In America it is very essential to observe the extraordinary variety and inequality 
of preparation offered in schools designed to prepare for the study of engineering. 
It is not the province of this report to characterize the secondary schools; all I feel 
called upon to mention is that which refers directly to the education of engineers. 
America possesses secondary schools (colleges and high schools) similar to ours; 
but they make extensive concessions to the practical bent of the nation and the 
times. They attempt to prepare for the university as well as for practical pursuits; 
many of them promote in their so-called classical divisions the ancient languages to 
a limited extent, and besides, in their English division, the modern languages. 
This latter division and independent schools similarly organized are essentially the 
normal preparatory schools for technological education. However, it is absolutely 
impossible to draw a sharp line of distinction. 
Furthermore, many universities have a special department in which, by means of 
instruction in natural sciences and mathematics, a preparation for an engineer’s 
education is offered. Uniform organization is not found in the field of secondary 
education. The secondary schools of one State vary greatly; only the schools of the 
same school district exhibit a certain uniformity; the consequence is that many 
details for comparison are lost, and even the totality of the preparation is difficult 
to sketch or characterize in a few words. 
 
-P-A-G-E-688
  678 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
The secondary schools in America, gauged by their courses of instruction and with 
our standard of measurement, offer a much lower preparation than ours. The lin- 
guistic branches are confined to English and the bare elements of foreign languages ; 
the mathematical preparation does not go beyond quadratic equations, plane geom- 
etry, and the elements of trigonometry. But the students bring to their higher 
studies on an average a clearer conception, better imagination, and much more joy 
in creative work and independence than with us. This is owing to natural talent, 
rational education, and less overburdening in pursuit of a one-sided, dry, linguistic 
study. They are not drilled much, nor are they spoiled by the quantity or the 
variety of study; they have open eyes, are accustomed to independent observation, 
and for the little they have learned they possess a very good comprehension. In 
the secondary schools much care is taken in physical training and out-door sports, 
which form a great treasure of valuable recollections in afterlife. For our com- 
parison the one circumstance is of importance, that the students leave the secondary 
institution at the age of 16 or 17, in order to enter the engineering school, hence they 
bring to them two years of preparatory study less than our graduates of gymnasia. 
The gaps in scientific preparation caused ‘thereby, as well as the entire mode of 
instruction, according to our standard, are very large, and oblige the engineering 
schools to devote one or two years to preparatory study before the professional study 
ean begin. 
Secondary schools without Latin are by far in the majority, and they are the pre- 
paratory institutions of engineering schools. The classical schools have no notice- 
able privileges. Secondary schools without Latin prepare not only for the study of 
engineering but for every study. Such an education in America lasts from 4 to 6 
years. ‘The students enter engineering schools, and consequently also practical life, 
at a comparatively early age; they waste no time upon the grammar of several lan- 
guages, and utilize their time in the study of natural sciences and mathematics. 
The tendency for investigation and observation is fostered in secondary schools more 
than with us, and it is done in well-equipped laboratories. The enormous economy 
in this practical tendency and in the shortening of the time of study can not be 
denied. The talents developed by such instruction, the faculty of representation, 
the senso of observation, and the tendency for investigation, can not be overesti- 
mated, and can never be replaced by the study of languages. 
The American secondary schools correspond to the requirements of a natural edu- 
cation, although they are, with reference to quantity of matter studied, below our 
classical gymnasia; yet, despite the fragmentary instruction preparatory for an engi- 
neering education, they furnish most suitable material, since the natural capacities 
of the students are developed, and since no attempt is made to pump more into the 
students than they can hold. 
The number of American secondary schools is extraordinarily large; the State of 
New York alone possesses no less than 520 preparatory schools ranking with our gym- 
nasia and Realschulen. The extraordinary variety they exhibit has been sketched 
in the foregoing remarks. 
Many schools have sprung into existence through competition and not in obedi- 
ence to organic development. Their catalogues are often models of business adver- 
tisements; frequently the purpose and object of a school can not be recognized by 
closely studying its programme. Naturally the number of hybrid institutions is 
very large. I have chosen my examples from schools that are generally considered 
good, or from such as have peculiar features. 
Recently a strong movement in favor of mannal training schools has been notice- 
able in America. Large funds are expended for them, and even older schools are 
influenced by the principles they advocate. Schools of a similar bent have been 
existing in America for some time, but without organic connection with the univer- 
sities or departments of engineeriag. A few modern schools of this kind, well- 
equipped and organized, have given by their success a mighty impulse and a new 
           
 
-P-A-G-E-689
    
AMERICAN TECHNOLOGICAL SCHOOLS. 679 
direction to the preparatory education for various professions; whether these schools 
will have a Jasting result can not be stated as yet, but because they illustrate the 
peculiar American idea, a few statements concerning them may seem in place. 
Manual training schools are much more than their name signifies. The train- 
ing in manual dexterity is only one and in fact the smaller part of the instruction 
they offer. It is only a means for other purposes. Such schools exist in St. Louis, 
Chicago, Cincinnati, Cambridge, Brooklyn, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Toledo, Cleve- 
land, San Francisco, and in some cities of the South. A great number of them have 
been established recently and are too young to show results as yet. In most all of 
these schools students are admitted at the age of 12 to lL years; they are taught, on 
an average, daily, four hours in general branches, two hours in shopwork, and one 
hour in drawing. Besides, two hours per week are devoted to military exercises. It 
is the purpose of these schools to give, simultaneously and coordinately with intel- 
lectual education, a systematically progressive training in praetical work and repre- 
sentation. The instruction is to be given in such a way that even in the workshop 
the main object remains intellectual activity and this leads to the recognition of 
reality. The systematic course, which is a matter of self-evidence in abstract sci- 
ences, is also followed in all practical exercises; that is to say, skill in the use of the 
hands is not taught for its ownsake. Especially the one idea is prevalent, that man- 
ual dexterity is proof of a certain direction of intellectual development, and if com- 
bined with knowledge of material, forces, and toois it is the foundation of practical 
judgment. 
These schools aim particularly at affording the students an easy selection of a pro- 
fession after having tested their personal natural capacity. He who has talent for 
science and practical—that is, natural—comprehension may become an. engineer; 
others may find it more suitable to remain true to mechanical work, and still others 
may turn to abstract studies. But always the one principle is maintained that 
intellectual, moral, and practical education are not to be subordinate but simulta- 
neous and coordinate. The latter shall assist both the former, for it is claimed that 
occupation with practical things and knowledge of things as they are and scientific 
theoretieal education can not oppose one another. 
A high moral influence is claimed for systematic practical work, and in this prin- 
ciple lies undoubtedly the common sense which induces the Hohenzollerns to have 
their young princes taught a trade. In America this occupation with things is 
much more extended and systematically introduced into the public system of educa- 
tion. We donot possess a similar institution, and our schoolmen donot even think 
of the possibility that education of intellect and judgment can be obtained in any 
better way than by studying the ancient languages, or that practical work should 
find room in the daily programme of a gymnasium. In America this idea has found 
_ noappreciation except in schools where the old English models were copied. All 
schools that sprung up upom American soil and are conducted in the American 
spirit donot recognize the contrast claimed between practical work and seience. 
In order to characterize this new kind of preparatory schools for the education of 
engineers I may be permitted to quote a few examples: 
Manual training school in St, Louis.—The school stands in connection with the 
Washington University of that city. Its motto is :       
“Hail to the skillful, cunning hand! 
Hail to the cultured mind! 
Contending for the world’s command, 
Here let them be combined!” 
The catalogue of the school informs the parents that the use of tools is taught 
not for the purpose of teaching trades or training machinists, but that equal care is 
bestowed upon languages, mathematics, sciences, practical work, and drawing. The 
school gives a preparation for polytechnical schools, for practical life, and every 
occupation that requires good discipline of intellect and hand. Its establishment 
 
-P-A-G-E-690
  680 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
dates back to 1879. The instruction began in 1880 with 67 students; at present the 
number of students is 400. The different departments are those of pure mathe- 
matics, applied mathematics, natural sciences, languages, drawing, and shopwork. 
The shops consist of two carpenter and joiner shops, one forging and welding 
shop, and one machine shop. Besides these the school possesses a chemical and a 
physical laboratory, splendidly equipped. The arrangement and equipment of the 
shops fall in no way below that of the American engineering schools and universities. 
All that is lacking are the laboratories for special scientific machine investigation, 
and, of course, the specific professional laboratory equipment of polytechnical 
schools. The instruction lasts from 9 until half-past 3, with a recess of thirty min- 
utes; two hours are assigned to shopwork, but this is continued after 4 o’clock, 
voluntarily and very frequently. The first year is devoted to-working in wood; 
the second to forging, welding, and molding; the third to tool making and working 
iniron. It must be added here that the Washington University has two other pre- 
paratory schools, the Smith Academy and the public high school of St. Louis, 
which are both inferior to the manual training school in their results.' 
The manual training school in Cambridge, near Boston, was established in 1888 and 
opened in 1892, together with the high school. The school owes its existence toa 
bequest of Mr. Rindge, who donated $75,000 and land of equal value; besides he 
placed at the disposal of the city government $100,000 for the public library, and 
$200,000 for the new city hall. 
The course of study is similar to the one followed in St. Louis. For the purpose 
of physical training extensive military and gymnastic exercises are introduced. 
The workshops for systematic manual training in wood and iron, molding, welding 
and forging, ete., are splendidly equipped. The school is a model institution of its 
kind.! 
The manual training school in Chicago was established in 1883 by the Commercial 
Club of Chicago. The requirements for admission are: Age, 14 years, and an exami- 
nation in reading, writing, geography, English, arithmetic, and history of the 
United States. The tuition fees are between $80 and $120 per year. At present it has 
15 professors and 300 students. Among the professors there are 1 for drawing, 4 for 
shopwork, the others for general branches of culture. The shops are particularly 
well arranged; 48 joiner benches, 24 turning lathes, 2 circular saws, 1 band saw, 1 
planing machine, 2 grindstones, ete., are found in the shops. The molding, weld- 
ing, and forging shops contain 2 molding ovens and 30 forges with accessories. 
The machine workshop contains 17 lathes, 2 planing machines, 2 borers, and 24 
vises, etc. Steam power is furnished for the shops by a Corliss machine of 50 
horse-power.! 
The fact that the old city of Boston contemplates the establishment of a manual 
training school is significant of the importance of such schools. For centuries this 
city followed exclusively our, or rather the English, linguistic system of education. 
In Boston the first Latin school was established in 1635; the English high school 
(first school without Latin) was opened in 1821; in our day technical education 
claims attention. 
The valuable part of technological instruction in America, laboratory study, cor- 
responds throughout to the same idea which the manual training schools endeavor 
to express, a combination of intellectual and practical education. In America this 
mode of education is latterly called briefly ‘(harmonious development,”-an expres- 
sion which, as is well known, was used with us for the study of the classics and as a 
definition of the humanistic tendency. 
American harmonious education appeals, first of all, to the perceptive faculty and 
to the judgment, based upon facts, and seeks the aim of education in “conducting

AMERICAN TECHNOLOGICAL SCHOOLS. 681 
the child into natural and practical life according to the measure of his natural 
capacities in correct relation to his natural and social environments.” The Ameri- 
cans speak of the moral advantages of manual work as something self-evident. For 
this harmonious education it is claimed especially that it offers the student a more 
abundant selection for the application of his talents, and that it imbues him with 
self-confidence and self-esteem by means of visible results of his practical work, 
thereby creating pleasure and confidence in further pursuit of his studies. This 
kind of education is considered an intellectual and moral discipline, because manual 
labor leads to investigation and observation, to the application of judgment, to an 
accumulation of experiences, and to independent activity, because it makes the 
pupil see that only his own effort and reflection can lead him to success. 
Conclusion.—The foregoing statements and descriptions of American schools can 
not be anything else than the description and characteristics of organization, man- 
agement, and school appliances. As far as criticism was uttered it was done with 
the intention of characterizing more briefly and more distinctly the topic of discus- 
sion; extensive description was thereby made unnecessary. The actual results of 
the instruction as a complicated function of the student’s natural talent, of the mode 
of instruction and the spirit with which it is imbued, as well as of things depending 
upon personal relations, have been excluded from this report. 
It can hardly be prevented that the bare facts stated by me will be judged incor- 
rectly; this danger could be avoided only by a critical comparison of American 
instruction with ours. However, such a comparison is absolutely impossible, since 
the institutions here and those across the ocean have developed historically amidst 
very different conditions, and since they are designed to meet different objects and 
reflect different views. It would be useless to measure the schools of the United 
States by our standard or judge them by our results. 
Without, therefore, entering into a criticism of our own school system, I may be 
permitted to insert into this report a general statistical comparison of a. few Euro- 
pean and American schools—one which will make plain to the eye how languages, 
natural sciences, the mathematical branches, professional study, and laboratory 
exercises are distributed in the course of study. I am confident that this will be 
more instructive than an extensive description. For this purpose I resort to a 
graphic presentation, which is very much shorter and more comprehensive than 
numerous columns of figures and notes would be. 
In the diagrams 1, 2, and 3, the courses of study in German secondary schools are 
shown. The heading of each shows what class of schools is meant. The whole 
length of a bar in the diagram represents the total instruction measured by time; 
the divisions of the line represent the portions of time given to each of the different 
branches. The figures inserted express this portion in per cents of the total time. 
The dark spaces on the left hand (a, b, c) show the measure of time devoted to 
linguistics; @ means ancient languages; b, modern foreign languages; ¢, the mother 
tongue, including logic and philosophic introduction, etc. 
The spaces marked B show the extent of the instruction in mathematics; C, in 
natural sciences; D, in the other branches, history, geography, etc., while the spaces 
marked E show the proportion of time in exercises in drawing and similar arts. 
Instruction in religion, music, and gymnastics, etc., is left out of consideration. 
From these diagrams we see that in Austrian and German gymnasia the great bulk 
of time and attention up to 50 per cent of the total instruction is devoted to the dead 
Janguages. The Austrian schools devote the greatest amount of time to the study 
of the dead languages, yet accomplish less than the Prussian gymnasia, because their 
course is one of eight instead of nine years. The real gymnasia show a remarkable 
extension of instruction in modern languages (up to 28.6 per cent) and an equal share 
of time and attention for the entire instruction in linguistics with that of the gym- 
nasia (up to 55 per cent). 
Comparing these with the preparatory schools in America, I present diagrams 5, 6, 
7,8, and 9, I chose schools from Massachusetts because they have, since time imme-

morial, been influenced by classical education, and are still so influenced more than 
other schools. The graphic representation offered on page 683 needs ne special expla- 
nation and must speak for itself. 
Several secondary schools of America which bear the name Latin schools neglect 
the natural sciences (C) almost completely, and language instruction is still more 
extended than in our gymnasia (up to 85 per cent), because a large amount of instruec- 
tion in modern languages is added (see diagram. 5). However. we must consider the 
fact that the course does not last eight or nine years, as in Austria and Germany, but 
only six years,

Further facts result from a comparison of the diagrams 1 to 9, namely, the small 
proportion of the natural sciences in the Prussian gymnasia, and their almost total 
neglect in the classical schools of America. In order to facilitate the comparison I 
insert here a diagram showing the distribution of branches in the Austrian secondary 
schools without Latin (diagram 4). Here we find the natural sciences treated exten-

  sively, also drawing (spaces E, up to 32 per cent). In Prussian schools of like kind 
drawing is not treated as well, and in the higher institutions for engineering it is 
lacking altogether. 
Diagrams 10, 11, 12, and 13 represent German technological schools, nameiy, No. 10 
in Austria, 11 in Prussia, 12 and 13 in southern Germany. The dark colored spaces, 
marked a, represent the branches that may be termed, collectively, theoretic prepara~ 
tory branches, with which the student is usually equipped already when he enters 
these polytechnica; hence these studies are essentially reviewed. 
The spaces marked b show the proportion of time given to the theoretical branches 
that prepare for the real professional study. Physics have been given partly toa 
and partly to b. 
The spaces marked c represent exclusive professional branches; and the dotted 
portion of these spaces is to show the proportion of time given to practical exercises 
following the lectures, The spaces marked e show the proportion of time given to 
special professional branches, while the spaces marked d represent the practical 
exercises in shops. 
A comparison shows that the German polytechnica devote much time to the review 
of theoretical preparatory studies (23 to 41 per cent), despite the fact that the pre- 
paratory course is one of eight or nine years in secondary schools. It further shows 
that the real professional instruction consists essentially in a theoretic training, and 
that the practical exercises, which in America play so great a réle, are very much 
neglected in German schools. Thus, for instance, in diagram 10 there is actually 
only 6 per cent of the time during the third school year given over to practical work 
in geometry. In diagram 11 we see that only exercises in mechanical technical labo- 
ratories are prescribed, amounting to a proportion of 5.6 per cent in the second 
school year, and 16.8 per cent practical work in electro-technique in the fourth school 
year. In diagram 12 shopwork is not represented at all, simply because it is not in 
the course. From this we see the great preponderance of theoretic instruction over 
practical. Exercises in drawing are given in sufficient proportion only in diagrams 
10 and 12 up to 50 per cent, while in the Prussian school, diagram 11, they recede to 
21.1 per cent. Compare the dotted part of spaces marked ¢ in diagrams 10, 11, 
‘and 12. 
Diagram 13 exhibits a considerable proportion of laboratory exercises; see black 
spaces marked d. No one will consider this proportion of practical work in the 
study of electro-technology superfluous, yet in other pursuits it is not considered 
so necessary.

It is plainly seen that the instruction in Continental Europe is defective, in that 
it does not bestow the amount of time and attention to the practical side which the 
American technological institutions readily give to it. 
In diagram 14 (Cornell University) and diagram 15 (the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology) we find the proportion of time given with reference to machine-shop 
work. In these diagrams we also see the great proportion of time devoted to pre- 
paratory instruction, marked a (up to 70 per cent), because the secondary schools 
have only a short course of four to six years, and the polytechnicum has to supply 
the deficiency. Above all, these diagrams show a very small proportion of oral 
theoretical instruction (marked b), and a very extensive laboratory study and shop- 
work (marked f and d). The study in experimental stations, as well as exercises 
in practical geometry, are marked d (up to 26 per cent), while shopwork is marked 
f (up to 32 per cent). Cornell University (diagram 14) has the most extensive exer- 
cises of this kind. 
Lastly, in diagram 16, a course is sketched which we find in the classical Yale 
University, so far as it refers to technological instruction. Here the practical exer- 
cises have been confined to mere exercises in surveying (marked d) in the first year’s 
study (10.2 percent). All the rest of the course consists of theoretic instruction, 
and the real professional instruction is insignificant compared with the elementary 
theoretic instruction. 
The foregoing graphic representations offer an opportunity to notice the extraordi- 
nary variety found in the proportion of preparatory and real professional instruction.

CHAPTER VIII. 
HIGHER EDUCATION OF WOMEN IN RUSSIA.! 
By Prince SrrGE WOLKONSKY, 
Delegate from the ministry of public instruction in Russia te the Columbian Exposition. 
* * * Educational establishments in Russia are not all under the surveillance 
of the same ministry; eleven different departments have schools, colleges, semina- 
ries, academies, and universities under their direction. This, of course, may appear 
to many as an impractical state of things, but it has many advantages, the most 
significant of which is the production of a great variety of types of educational 
establishments. A brief sketch of the different types of girls’ schools, at least the 
most important ones, must be given before we speak of higher instruction. 
Three different departments have the direction of educational establishments for 
women. These are the department of the institutions of the Empress Marie, the 
ecclesiastical department, and the ministry of public instruction. 
Iscarcely need speak of the first one here in Chicago. Anybody can get the most 
complete idea of it in visiting the department of liberal arts at the Columbian 
Exposition, where the six hundred educational and charitable establishments of the 
institutions of Empress Marie are magnificently represented under the surveillance 
of Mme. Semechkin. The most important educational establishments of this depart- 
ment are the so-called institutes or seminaries for girls, which are under very strict 
regulations. The boarding pupils, or internats, are only allowed to leave in the 
summer months, if they desire to return to their parents. The education given 
is a very accomplished one in so far as preparing the girls as well for intellectual 
family life as for the laborious life of a governess. These establishments are under 
the special patronage of Her Majesty the Empress. Ladies of high rank sometimes 
are called to direct them, and the greatest dignitaries of the State are members of 
the committee of trustees, which has the higher supervision of all the institutes of 
the Empire. 
The second type of establishments belonging to that department are the gymna- 
siums and progymnasiums, or high schools for girls. They are of interest because 
special higher pedagogic classes are attached to some of them. The course in these 
classes lasts three years, and its object is to prepare the young ladies for a teacher’s 
career. There they get acquainted with different methods of teaching and of trans- 
mitting to others the knowledge which they may acquire durivg the seven years of 
their school course. The third year is entirely devoted to practical exercises, where 
the ladies, assisted by professors, give lessons to the pupils of the progymnasium in 
the following subjects: Sacred history, Russian language, arithmetic, geography, 
French and German languages. The courses are divided into three groups: The 
group of Russian language and literature, the group of foreign languages (French 
and German), and the group of mathematics. Lessons in religion, Russian, old 
Slavonic, and arithmetic are on the programme of each of the three groups. Ladies 
who have finished these courses receive a diploma of graduate teacher, conferring 
upon them the right of oceupying the chairs of the above-mentioned subjects in the 
four lower classes (and of foreign languages in all classes) of gymnasiums and 
progymnasiums for girls.

Among the establishments of the ecclesiastical department we must mention the 
diocesan schools for girls. These establishments, the number of pupils in which 
amounted last year to 13,000, are assigned to daughters of priests and clergy, and 
prepare them for the rough career of teachers in village schools. For over three 
years I had the opportunity of closely observing some of these girls at their work, 
and I must say we can not have enough respect and admiration for the really apos- 
tolic mission they fulfill. Buried in some distant village, miles away from railroads, 
separated from her family, such a young creature undertakes her struggle for life, 
depending upon a poor and illiterate community which is not always able or willing 
to pay her the ridiculously small salary that is supposed to recompense her for her 
work and for her life. For 12 rubles ($4) a month she has to provide for herself; a 
peasant’s hut, where she finds lodgings for 20 rubles a year, becomes her home; the 
peasant’s family, her only social resource, if there is no priest in the village or no 
landowner’s house in the neighborhood; the rare visits of the educational inspector 
or of some other member of the district school committee, and the annual arrival 
in the spring of the examination commission, are the only events that break the 
monotony of her life in a milieu that is not hers, and where she has, in her way, a 
sort of rank to sustain; for she must not forget that she is not a peasant woman; 
she has to dress like a lady, she has to behave herself like a lady. I knew one of 
these teachers who had an invalid mother to support and a little brother whom she 
prepared for college. Numbers of them are scattered over the surface of our vast 
country. Theirnames areunknown. They are not represented at the Fair, and will 
hardly ever be represented anywhere; butin this country, where an ordinary work- 
man in some distant ranch of your far West is lodged and boarded and gets $30 a 
month; in this country, where intellectual labor is recompensed as nowhere else; in 
this country, which has given such great examples of pioneering and of dissipating 
darkness; in this country, ladies, I request your respect and your love for these your 
distant sisters who have no other joy in life than to watch the glimpse of light they 
gradually transmit to the minds of the little folks whom they aim to teach. 
After having paid our tribute to these two important departments we may now 
pass to therestablishments of the ministry of public instruction. We will not go 
into details regarding secondary education; we only just mention that, according to 
the report for 1891, the ministry of public instruction had under its direction 342 
establishments (gymnasiums and progymnasiums) with 62,529 pupils in them, and 
we pass on to the special subject under consideration. 
The history of the higher educational courses for women is rather eventful, and 
has passed through various phases. The question first arose in 1869, when permis- 
sion was given from the ministry of public instruction to organize a series of publi¢ 
lectures in history, philosophy, and science at St. Petersburg and Moscow. The 
course had no settled plan, nor were any preliminary studies required from the 
pupils. In the year 1872 Mr. Guerrier, professor in the University of Moscow, opened 
his college of higher courses for girls, where special attention was given to thestudy 
of universal literature and Russian history. At this epoch the necessity of aregular 
university education for women made itself felt by the great number of girls who 
went abroad in search of scientific knowledge. 
An imperial ukase of the year 1876 authorized the foundation of higher courses 
on various subjects for women at different universities of Russia; and in the course 
of the same and the next year such colleges were established at Kazan, St. Peters- 
burg, and Kief. They were divided into two faculties, the historico-philological and 
physico-mathematical. The colleges at St. Petersburg and Kief and those of Pro- 
fessor Guerrier, in Moscow, have a four-years course each; that of Kazan a two-years 
course. Besides this, special classes of instruction for girls have been attached to 
the third Moscow gymnasium, with a four-years course of natural science and three 
years in mathematics. All these establishments were regarded as private institu- 
tions, but the board of education was obliged to exert general control over these 
establishments during each academic year. They had no general regulations, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-699

the whole organization has for a long time been regarded as atemporary one. Only 
in 1879 preliminary work in preparing a general regulation for the girls’ higher col- 
leges was begun; but it was interrupted by the resignation, in 1880, of Count Tolstoi 
from his post of minister of public instruction. 
In the year 1884, by order of His Imperial Majesty, a committee was created, which 
was presided over by the under secretary of state, Prince Wolkonsky. Its object 
was to find out the best means for the organization of superior education for girls in 
the Empire. But, in the meantime, the admission of new students to the courses 
was forbidden, and it remained so for a little over two years. In June, 1889, the 
results elaborated by the above-mentioned commission were put into action, and in 
September of the same year admission to the courses was renewed. 
© After this historical sketch let us consider the scientific side of the institution. 
The course lasts four years, and is divided into two sections: The historico-philo- 
logical and the mathematical. The following are the lists of the subjects on which 
lectures are held: 
(1) In the historico-philological section: Religion, psychology, logic, history of 
philosophy, Russian language, old Slavonic, history of Russian literature, ancient 
and modern theory of literary forms, Slavonic idioms and literature, universal 
literature (this includes Italian, French, German, and English literatures in their 
connection with the development of Russian literature’, Russian history, history 
of the peoples of Slavonic race, ancient history, history of modern times, history” 
of arts, Latin language and literature. 
(2) In the mathematical section: Religion, general course of mathematics, analyt- 
ical geometry, algebraical analysis, differential and integral calculus, astronomy, 
physics, organic and inorganic chemistry, physical geography, and analytical 
mechanics. 
The extensiveness of these programmes does not prevent serious or conscientious 
study. The pupils obtain very complete knowledge in all branches of the section 
they select, and at the same time they have the opportunity of trying to solve any 
special question in its smallest details. In this sense the higher courses include in 
the limits of their programmes that principle which you formulate so clearly and so 
aptly when you say that ‘‘a man should know everything of something and some- 
thing of everything.” 
We have before our eyes the annual reports of the director of the St. Petersburg 
higher course for women for the last three years; and I take the liberty of com- 
municating to you some details illustrating the scientific level of the young ladies’ 
work. In the year 1891 there were 385 pupils in the four courses, and 298 of these 
were in the historico-philological and 87 in the mathematical section. This prefer- 
ence for history and literature has always characterized our women, although in 
mathematics we find quite interesting works on most abstract subjects. Director 
Koolin quotes in his reports such themes as ‘“‘An approximate calculus of definite 
integrals,” or ‘‘Euler’s formule of quadrations,” and others. In 1890 our celebrated 
compatriot, Mme. Kovalevsky,' who was professor.of mathematics at the Uni- 
  
1 Mme. Sophie Kovalevsky, daughter of General Kronkovsky and descendant of Mattaias Corvin, 
was born in Moscow in 1850. After her marriage with Vladimir Kovalevsky she studied at Heidel- 
berg University, and in 1870 went to Berlin University. At a later date she received the degree of 
doctor in philosophy from Géttingen University for a mathematical thesis on the theory of equations. 
In 1883 Mme. Kovalevsky published an essay on the refraction of light, and was soon after called by 
Prof. Mittag-Lefiler, of Stockholm University, to aid him as docent in his mathematical professor- 
ship. Her first course gave her a chair at the university, and led her hearers to place her with 
Lagrange and Laplace as a poct among mathematicians. In 1886 the Academy of Sciences in Paris 
proposed, for the Bordin prize, to be decided in 1888, the question, “ Perfectionner en un point impor- 
tant la théorie du mouvement d’un corps solido’” (On the theory of movement of a solid). ‘The prize 
was awarded unanimously to Mme. Kovalevsky, whose profound study of the subject placed her in 
rank with Euler and Lagrange. ‘This thesis, with others relating to the differentials of all determi- 
nate functions, placed her in the front rank among mathematicians, and she was féted in Paris, Hel- 
singfors, Christiania, and St. Petersburg by the most learned savants. She returned to Stockholm, 
where she died in February, 1891. (From Revue des Deux Mondes, May 15, 1894.)

versity of Stockholm, honored with her presence the examination of the physico- 
mathematical section, and Director Koolin mentions with satisfaction the good 
impressions she gathered during her visit. We must note here that the only three 
ladies who lecture in this establishment are mathematicians. These are Mme. Schiff, 
who directs the practical exercises in mathematics; Mme. Serdebinsky in physies, 
and Mme. Bogdanovsky, graduate doctor of the Geneva University, in chemistry. 
In the historico-philological section, philosophical questions seem to have mostly 
interested the young women. Professor Vedensky speaks in the best terms of such 
works as ‘On some internal sensations, according to Beaunis,” “On the constitu- 
tion of our self-consciousness, according to Taine and Strahoff,” ‘‘ On the principles 
of knowledge in John Stuart Mill’s Logic,” “On the atomic theory of matter, accord- 
ing to Professor Strahoff,” ‘‘ The universe as a whole,” “On the immortality of the 
soul, according to Plato,” and other abstruse subjects. 
National history has been much studied, and very minute investigations have 
been made by women on some original texts of ancient Slavonic chronicles. Such 
works.as “The fall of Novgorod in olden Russian ch: onicles” and ‘ The eonquest of 
Kazan in 1552 as it appears from annals and traditions,” are considered by Professor 
Platonoff as essaysof quite individual and independent value. 
Several women are well acquainted with different Slavonic idioms and have made 
valuable translations of Servian and Bulgarian popular songs into Russian. 
Ido not wish to fatigue you with minute details concerning the financial status 
of the establishment, but I can not pass the question by, as I think itis of significant 
importance in showing how much public opinionis favorably disposed toward higher 
education for women. The St. Petersburg higher courses are supported by the Gov- 
ernment and by the municipality; this sum amounts to 6,000 rubles a year, while 
the whole maintenance of the establishment, according to the director's report, costs 
ten times.as much. From whence come these funds? Except the students’ fees all 
the rest are voluntary donations of private individuals. We can hardly give an 
idea of their extent and variety, not only in large amounts of money (such as have 
been given by Mesdames Sibiriacoff, Shamiansky, Vargounin, and others), but in 
active help of all kinds, beginning with the architect who erected the building and 
refused all compensation. During the two transition years, when admission to the 
courses was refused, most of the professors lectured gratis; the two doctors attached 
to the establishment, one of whom is a lady, never wanted to accept anything for 
their daily attendance. Professors, writers, and scientific societies contributed to 
_ the enlargement of the library, and the papers have always published gratis all 
announcements concerning the courses. 
Another thing that characterizes the popularity of the courses is the fact that 
students come from such distant places as Tiflis and Baka, in the Caucasus; or Tomsk, 5 
Emisseisk, and Irkfitsk, in Siberia. It is to be noted, too, that the most generous 
donors contributing to the prosperity of the establishment are two Siberian ladies. 
We must now say a few words in regard to the higher medical courses founded in 
St. Petersburg in the year 1872. Strange as it may appear here in America, these 
courses for women were under the direction of the ministry of war and attached to 
military hospitals. The students from these courses were of great help during the 
last Turkish war in 1877, where they showed courage and utter self-abnegation. In 
times of peace women doctors chiefly practice in villages, where the provincial hos- 
pitals are often under their direction; in the southeastern provinces their help is 
priceless among the Mohammedans, because of the strict religious laws that forbid 
women having any medical attendance from men. Unfortunately, these courses 
were closed in 1888, chiefly for pecuniary reasons; but at the same time other med- 
ical courses attached to the Nativity Hospital of St. Petersburg were reenforced in 
order to supply this lapse. During the sixteen years of their existence the higher 
medical courses sent out about 1,000 graduates; the first Russian women doctors 
were Mesdames Sousloff and Koskevaroff.

~ PAPERS PREPARED FOR THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CON- 
GRESS. 
Lrprary Economy. 
The president of the American Library Association, Mr. Melvil 
Dewey, in the year of the Columbian Exposition conceived the happy 
idea of preparing a volume on library economy, assigning the several 
portions of the work to special experts with the purpose of having the 
papers thus prepared read at the International Library Congress to be 
held in Chicago during the summer of 1893. The following letter from 
Mr. Dewey explains the plan, purpose, and execution of the following 
papers on library economy, which together constitute a unique and 
valuable treatise on the general subject of the management of libraries: 
While secretary of the American Library Association during its first fifteen years, 
the need of a manual of library economy was constantly felt, and much of my time 
was given to correspondence and to preparation and publication of matter destined 
after revision to form chapters of such a manual. When elected again to the presi- 
dency for the World’s Fair meeting, I undertook with the approval of the executive 
board to utilize the unusual opportunity for making such a volume by cooperation. 
The following brief extracts from some of the many official circulars sent out 
will make clear the plan: 
“The proceedings of the American Library Association Columbian meeting will 
form a library handbook to take the place of the Centennial library volume pub- 
lished by the Bureau of Education, which has long been out of print. That did 
much good, but was written just before modern library activity began. Obviously 
a much better book can now be written by well organized cooperation among lead- 
ing members of the association. The historical and statistical parts will be made 
by the Bureau of Education, which has by far the best facilities for this work, but 
it is our province to contribute the library economy. 
“T hope the experiment of this systematic programme for the World’s Fair meeting 
will be so successful that we may another year take the historical side and make a 
historical handbook, and a third year take the bibliographic side, putting all our 
strength on that. This will give the profession three splendid volumes. Bearing 
this in mind, the writers for this year should avoid going into historical details and 
make their papers not ordinary essays but a compact and useful judicial summing 
up of the principles of library economy.” | 
The official programme of the ten days’ meeting at Chicago made the following 
statement: 
“PLAN OF PROGRAMME, 
“The programme is so planned as to make the printed proceedings a handbook of 
library economy setting forth the points of general agreement attained in the seven- 
teen years since organization at the Centennial, and also the points on which our 
best thinkers still differ.

  “Each author will revise his paper, utilizing the discussions, so that as finally 
printed in the proceedings it will represent the position of the subject at the 
close instead of at the beginning of the 1893 meeting. 
“The aim is, therefore, to present a judicial digest of previous articles, papers, 
discussions, and specially of experience, rather than to contribute new material. 
The substance of perhaps 100 or more contributions scattered through library serials 
and proceedings, general periodical literature, reports, bulletins, etc., are put ina 
single short paper, in two parts; the first stating what is generally accepted by well 
informed librarians, not necessarily what the author thinks; the second giving the 
| points on that subject which are still under discussion and to the solution of which 
the Columbian meeting ought materially to contribute. 
“While the papers will thus be very condensed they are not to be read at the meet- 
. ings, but will be furnished in advance to members; and the time at the meeting will 
be devoted to discussing unsettled points which will be presented by the author in a 
five minutes summary. It is thus expected to get from a single daily session as much 
. practical good as is usually obtained from the three, and in the time thus gained to 
more than double the great practical value of our annual meeting by thorough study 
of the library exhibit.” 
After the meeting the following were among the instructions sent to each author 
concerning final revision of his chapter: 
“The abstract printed in advance in the Library Journal, the full paper as pre- 
pared before the meetings, the shorthand reports of discussions, with any informa- 
tion from other sources specially collected for the A. L. A. exhibit, should be used in 
revising or rewriting the chapter to make it as practically valuable as possible for 
reference. 
“As general editor of the volume, I shall state the plan and opportunities for dis- 
cussion and revision, but shall not claim approval of the A. L. A. for the published 
result, as the new constitution forbids promulgating any recommendations in library 
economy by the A. L. A. without previous approval by the council. Each author is 
therefore alone responsible for his chapter. You are not restricted to what was sub- 
mitted at the meeting, but are free to write now what you see fit, provided the rule 
laid down from the first is followed: that you state not your individual preferences, 
but the points of agreement and difference among competent librarians with the best 
statement you can make of different claims. A point of agreement does not mean 
that a bare majority of those consulted hold this opinion. In all cases where data 
has been collected the number of votes ought to be noted, at least in brackets or 
footnotes. On many points our discussions showed us to be practically unanimous, 
but wherever a respectable minority held different views they are entitled to fair 
mention in these chapters. We must all guard against assuming the position of an 
advocate of methods we personally prefer, rather than that of a judge of all those 
found to have substantial merits. Each author might be described as a World’s 
Fair judge to report on the subject, as other judges report on exhibits. We must not 
be misled by mere nambers using certain methods, for fifty librarians may be using 
one form and three another form unknown to the others, but which the entire fifty- 
three would prefer. 
“After a statement of what is being done and approved by competent judges we 
shall be glad to have each author add his personal views resulting from his study, 
provided he puts them clearly as such.” 
This is the plan on which these articles have been prepared. As editor I have 
had extended correspondence with some of the authors; with others hardly a single 
note has been exchanged. In some cases footnotes have been added to supply omis- 
sions, but the editor has not undertaken to supplement or modify the papers as 
revised. 
In preparing these chapters and in collecting the international library exhibit 
made by the American Library Association under the auspices of the United States 
Bureau of Education, many thousand circulars were sent out. The returns, contain-

ing an amount of valuable technical information never before so fully o: 
collected, have all been preserved, classified, bound, and indexed, and, 
library exhibit itself, are fully available to all interested in the library, museum of 
the New York State library school at Albany. 
In behalf of library interests the world over, the editor wishes to thank the 
authors of these articles for the important service they have rendered to librarian- 
ship. 
From his entrance on his official duties the present Commissioner of Education has 
shown an interest in and knowledge of modern library aims and methods which has 
commanded the admiration and cooperation of all interested in developing to its 
full possibility the great educational agency known as the public library system. 
The publication of these chapters where they may reach the largest number and do 
tbe most good simply adds one more to the long list of official acts which have made 
his administration marked at home and abroad, wherever educationists keep informed 
as to the work of government departments.

LIBRARIES IN RELATION TO, SCHOOLS. 
Hannan P. JAMES, 
Librarian in Osterhout Free Library, Wilkesbarre, Pa. 
Object to be attained.—Dr. W. T. Harris in his address at the Fa- 
byan house conterence in 1890, on “The function of the library and the 
school in education,” said: “The school gives the preliminary prepara- 
tion for education, and the library gives the means by which the indi- 
vidual completes and accomplishes his education.” These few words 
embody the sentiments of the typical modern librarian, and his chief 
aim is so to impress them on the instructors of youth that the schools 
and the libraries shall work together for one and the same purpose— 
the true education of man from his earliest years to the close of his 
earthly career. 
How to begin.—First, enlist the interest of the superintendent of 
schools or members of the school board in a close connection between 
the schools and the library. In New Jersey all libraries organized 
ander the law of 1884 have the superintendent as an ex-officio member 
of the library board. In other places the superintendent or some of 
the principals are elected as members. Minneapolis has both the super- 
intendent of schools and the president of the university, and gains 
greatly thereby in a wise and intelligent administration. 
Without these exceptional advantages, however, much depends on 
enlisting the hearty cooperation of the school board; for while the most 
intelligent teachers rarely need more than the opportunity to enter into 
the work, others have to be won over and encouraged by the impelling 
influence of authority. Their aid, too, is often needed in arranging the 
details of the work, both in school and out. 
To interest teachers.—Seek personal intercourse with the teachers 
and explain to them the value and aim of the work proposed. Visit the 
schools if possible and make yourself familiar with their work. Invite

  694 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
the teachers by grades to the library to examine books adapted to their 
classes. Ask for suggestions of books to buy. Feel a real interest in 
the teachers and their work, and never be too busy to pass a friendly 
word with them. One librarian lends pictures mounted on cardboard 
to teachers who do not at first care for books, and so wins them. Speak 
at teachers’ institutes of your aims, and the great work that can be 
accomplished by cooperation. Do not rest till every teacher uses the 
library. The books are quite often of as much value to the teacher as 
to the pupil. Los Angeles invites teachers to join the library club and 
finds it most helpful. 
How to aid teachers.—If possible, have some one specially fitted by 
training and disposition to take charge of the school work which must 
fall on the librarian or one of his assistants. If the latter is chosen 
with special reference to, her fitness for aiding and inspiring the teach- 
ers, just so much more good will be accomplished. Several libraries 
have made such appointments, and devote Saturday mornings during 
term time and two hours every day after school to assisting both teach- 
ers and pupils. Lists of books for school use are prepared, sometimes 
classified, and with notes; written lists of new books received are made, 
the books themselves being shown. Call numbers are entered in 
Sargent’s, Caller’s, Hardy’s, Hewins’s, and other lists, and lent to the 
teachers : 
Grades allowed use of books.—From some libraries only the 
high school is allowed to draw books for school use. More allow high 
and grammar schools, leaving out the primary school. If our aim is to 
educate and direct the tastes and habits of thought of the people, the 
work can not begin too early. Train the twig into a straight and healthy 
growth, if you wish a straight and healthy tree. As it is estimated that 
nearly half the pupils leave school at or before reaching the grammar 
grade, it is necessary to interest them in good books before that time, 
making them feel that the library has something of value to them, and 
is as much for them, if they will but use it, as for others. Better 
results will be obtained in the higher grades by pupils trained in the 
use of books from the beginning. 
Number of volumes lent.—From 2 to 40 volumes each are allowed 
at one time by different libraries, the average number lent by 50 libraries 
being 7. The number varies somewhat, but not always according to 
the sizeof the library. A moderate limit may with advantage be estab- 
lished in the beginning; but later, if an earnest teacher wants and can 
use a large number to advantage, without detriment to the needs of 
other teachers, he should have them. Thirty-three libraries report no 
limit, leaving it to the judgment of the librarian. Milwaukee allows 
one volume to each pupil. 
Special libraries:—W hat are called “special libraries” of 50 volumes 
each, are in some cities sent to the schools instead of, or in addi- 
tion to, those lent on school cards. These are retained a specified  
-P-A-G-E-705
  ‘THE WORLD'S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 695 
time—from four to eight weeks—and exchanged bodily at the expira- 
tion of that time with other schools. These “special libraries” often 
contain duplicates for simultaneous reading, the pupils being required. 
to discuss the books and prepare papers on them. Detroit, Worcester, 
Milwaukee, Cleveland, Columbus, and other libraries use this method. 
to great advantage. Detroit has 4,000 volumes circulating in this way, 
2,000 of them in the high school. New York State appropriates 
$25,000 a year for its publie library division of the educational exten- 
sion department,' and “traveling libraries” are a central feature in its 
most efficient practical work. 
In outlying districts at a distance from the main library teachers 
not infrequently act as agents in receiving and delivering the library 
books to the people of the neighborhood. While this distribution does 
not come under the head of “school work,” the teacher can, if he will, 
exert a wise and helpful influence by aiding in the selection of the best 
books of all classes. 
Duplicates.—Duplicates ranging in number from 2 to 100 copies 
are purchased by different libraries. Where all members of a class 
are required to read the same book for seminars or essays, large dupli- 
cation is necessary. Such duplication, however, would seem to be more 
appropriately provided by the school boards, unless school funds are 
given the library directly for that purpose, as at Los Angeles, where 
$5,500 a year are applied to the purchase of schoolbooks. 
Where a limited number of books is lent, fewer duplicates and greater 
variety, unless in special eases, will be found advisable. All classes of 
the same grade do not use the same books at the same time. For 10 
grammar schools 6 copies of any one book are usually enough. Excep- 
tionally valuable books may require more duplicating. Variety excites 
interest in research and comparison. Buy carefully up to demand, 
rather than beyond it. 
Where a limited treasury will not admit of any duplication, judicious 
buying, with due regard to school work, and as liberal a use of books 
on hand as the library can afford, will be of incalculable benefit. 
The main point is to teach the children to use the library to the best 
advantage, to cultivate a real love of books and a thirst for knowledge. 
Fiction.—Fiction, without decidedly moral or educational tenden- 
cies, is seldom allowed. . While judicious teachers might often use 
fiction to good advantage, were it allowed to be freely drawn on school 
cards, there would be danger of an excessive use of it by others not 
so judicious. One library reports such use,-and the consequent with- 
drawal of all library privileges. Some use historical fiction freely in 
connection with historical studies; some, 1 volume of fiction to 8 or 10 
others; and many none at all, excepting to lowest primary grades, to 
incite a desire to use the books and to learn to-read. In the latter 
  
1 By the new law of 1892 it also grants $55,000 a year for school libraries, to be kept 
in the building as a part of the school apparatus.

  696 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
grades the old classic fairy tales are useful in awakening the interest 
and imagination of those coming from ignorant and degraded homes. 
Following these, Andrews’s Seven Little Sisters, Kirby’s Aunt Martha’s 
Corner Cupboard, with other similar books, will easily lead up to more 
serious reading. 
As arule, children do not need to be taught to read fiction, but by 
cultivating in them a taste for history, literature, natural science, etc., 
we may be reasonably sure that they will choose only the better class 
of fiction when left to themselves. And as the schools exist at great 
cost to the public, purely for the education of the young, it would seem 
to be the obvious duty of the library in its connection with the schools 
to furnish them only with books of a decidedly educational nature. In 
the high school grades standard fiction is used with advantage in the 
study of literature. 
Limit of time allowed and care of books.—Books are usually lent 
for a limited period, with privilege of an indefinite number of renewals. 
Some issue for an unlimited period. By allowing one renewal only 
fewer duplicates are needed, but 1m consequence the children can not 
familiarize themselves so fully with the books. Fewer books thoroughly 
read are often better for the children than a greater variety with insuffi- 
cient time for careful perusal. Accounting for books every two or four 
weeks by the teacher encourages greater care on his part. The work 
can be delegated to one of the pupils, under the teacher’s supervision, 
or, as in some libraries, the assistant in charge of school work can visit 
the schools and renew the books, examining their condition at the same 
time. Torn books should be returned to the library immediately, and 
lost books reported and paid for by the loser, or by the whole school if 
the loser is unknown or unable. Responsibility for the careful use of 
public’ property is a lesson which can not be learned too early, and 
children will value books more highly if, in case of loss or damage, they 
are required to contribute a few pennies apiece to make the loss good. 
Give them all possible privileges, but teach them to feel a sense of 
responsibility for those privileges. 
Record of school circulation.—A bout half the libraries heard from 
report no record kept of school circulation, because no special system 
is used. A ledger account with each teacher is valuable as showing 
titles of books drawn. Kept in small pass books, and alphabeted 
by teachers’ names, this method is convenient and helpful. Where a 
charging-slip system is used, colored slips for schoolbooks show at a 
glance the character, date, and amount of school circulation. By this 
méthod warning can be sent teachers, if necessary, in season to pre- 
vent fines, but if fines accrue they should be paid. While the total 
amount of circulation can not show the full value of the work done, 
it serves as an indication, and on both librarian and teachers it acts 
as an inspiration and incentive. Special school cards are often used, 
either placed in book pockets or retained at the library. In the latter
-P-A-G-E-707

case, teacher’s naine and date of return are written on the book dover. 
Teachers are advised to write date of return or renewal on the black- 
board. ‘ 
Influence of library on pupils.—Some librarians ask for lists of 
books read by each pupil, with comments on favorites. These lists are 
returned to the pupils with words of encouragement and advice from 
the librarian. Some invite children to write notes to them expressing 
their appreciation and wants. A letter from the librarian commending 
care and good use of books is greatly valued, and creates a personal 
feeling of friendship for the library. Better still is the custom of some 
to visit the schools once a year and talk with the pupils. Classes are 
invited to visit the library at stated times and are shown objects of 
natural history or science, if such form a part of it. 
These methods, or any others used with a sincere desire to win the 
children to a love of the library, will have their reward in a great 
increase of interest among the young. Kindly personal influence is 
one of the greatest factors of success in this work. 
Reference use by pupils.—Extensive use for reference is reported 
by nearly all libraries, some situated near the schools having daily 
visits from whole classes. Others, according to their ability, afford every 
possible aid, considering it their most valuable work. As mentioned 
above, Saturday forenoons and two hours after school daily are in some 
places devoted to the special assistance of teachers and pupils. 
Class rooms.—Few libraries have class rooms designed specially 
for that use, but several report them as future possibilities when new 
buildings or additions are completed. For class work they are invalu- 
able, as large collections of books can be examined and discussed, a 
love of research instilled, and a familiarity cultivated that will often 
lead pupils to prosecute their studies after their school life ends. 
Worcester has a class room for every subject—history, fine arts, 
natural science, etc. 
Teachers’ cards.—Teachers are usually allowed to draw extra books 
for purposes of study, the number varying from two to any number 
desired, but generally for a limited time. Teachers’ cards are issued to 
all teachers whether residents or not. Books on pedagogy and kindred 
subjects should be provided and the teachers asked to suggest titles for 
their own use. 
Teachers’ influence on home circulation.—Some libraries report a 
decided influence on home circulation from school work, apart from the 
books lent to pupils from the school. Librarians find teachers the most 
efficient helpers possible in securing the entrance of good books into 
families which can in no other way be reached. They are the only ones 
who can do that work, and they should be encouraged to distribute 
registration blanks, and help in the selection of books for home read- 
ing by short lists or catalogs furnished them for the purpose. They 
should be impressed with the greatuess of their opportunities for good.

ADAPTATION OF.LIBRARIES TO CONSTITUENCIES. ! 
By SaMuEL Swett GREEN, 
Public librarian, Worcester, Mass, 
A resident of a Massachusetts town to which the Commonwealth was 
about to give $100 worth of books came to secure my influence as a 
member of the State free public library commission to have a large part 
of the $100 spent for rare and expensive books on Massachusetts his- 
tory. As a large and valuable library made up principally of books of 
that class was soon to be given to another small town in the same county, 
it would have been manifestly unwise to grant this request. It seems 
unwise also to place a students’ library in a smail town where there are 
few who will use it. It would be better to give the library to a flour- 
ishing institution at a county seat, on condition that it shall be open 
for free consultation by all residents of the county, and that, under 
proper rules, books may be lent from it to inhabitants of smaller towns 
for use at home. 
In this way the library would be so placed that most persons wishing 
to make investigations would have the books near home, and the com- 
paratively few investigators in the smaller towns, such as the man in 
the town first-mentioned, would also have their interests provided for. 
The trustees of the Thomas Crane Public Library at Quincy, Mass., 
have concluded, utilizing the experience of many years, that a working 
library of 15,000 volumes is sufficient to supply the general wants of 
the 20,000 residents of the city. It is proposed not to let the library 
grow beyond 20,000 volumes while the wants of the city remain what 
they are, and when it exceeds that number of volumes to cut it down 
by taking out books that never have been needed in a popular library 
like that in Quincy or that have become useless. It having become 
evident that an addition would presently have to be made to the build- 
ing if the recent rate of increase should continue, it seemed best to the 
trustees to begin at once to reduce the size of the library. They pro- 
ceeded, under the able leadership of Mr. Charles Francis Adams, to 
remove from the library large numbers of Government documents, 
     1 With this paper should be read those pages of the Chicago discussions in which it 
' was pointed out by leading librarians that to weed out safely would require much 
costly expert service; that the most hurtful criticism would be attacks after inev 
ble cases where some one would greatly wish a book that had been withdrawn as 
useless; that the printed catalogs already circulated would be made untrustworthy 
by parting with any volume included; that what one wise and learned man would 
throw out as trash, another equally wise and learned would consider specially val- 
uable because of differing personal equations. In short, that however excellent in 
theory, it was perhaps the most difficult thing in librarianship to put successfully in 
practice. 
While few favored “weeding out” simply to gain room by getting rid of books 
little wanted, many believe in transferring to other libraries which have a distinctly 
greater need of them.—M, D. 
 
-P-A-G-E-709

unnecessary duplicates, books of an outgrown ephemeral interest, and 
those unsuited to the locality. Twenty-one hundred and forty-five 
volumes were remoyed immediately. The Quincy library, by adopting 
this course, relieves itself from very considerable prospective expenses 
and secures money to use in increasing its usefulness. 
Part of the plan is to keep the printed catalogs of the small library 
up to date and to scatter copies of them widely throughout the city by 
selling them at a nominal price. It is always expensive to prepare and 
print a good catalog; it is very expensive to issue new editions fre- 
quently. Still, ifa popular library is to do its work well it must intro- 
duce its constituents to its books by means of frequent revised editions 
of a good, printed catalog. 
The Thomas Crane Library has been famous for the excellence of its 
annotated catalog and for lists of books on special subjects for the 
use of school children. It proposes in future to use more money than 
in the past in making, printing, and keeping up to date good eata- 
logs, and, in order to make it practicable to do so, to keep down the 
number of volumes in the library, thus reducing the expenses of cata- 
loging, and also to save money in housing its books. That is to say, 
it is acting on the well-established principle that a small library well 
cataloged, if at. all adapted in the number of its volumes to the size 
of a town, is of inealculably greater advantage to its constituency than 
one many times larger but poorly equipped with catalogs. 
It is a distinctive feature of the Quincy plan not to make the library 
a special reference library. That city is very near Boston and Cam- 
bridge, which it is well known are richly supplied with large general 
and numerous special libraries. 
When aman appears in Quiney who wishes to make a minute inquiry 
on some special subject, it is proposed to refer him to the great libraries 
in the neighboring cities, ahd to confine the efforts of the trustees of the 
Quincy library to supplying the general wants of its constituency. 
Here, then, is a bold attempt at adapting a library to its constituency. 
Shall it be seconded? 
Many will hold it unwise to diseuss such a subject publicly. Remem- 
bering many ill-judged efforts at economy by ignorant, uneducated, or 
parsimonious men in town meetings and on library boards, they will 
pronounce it hurtful to libraries to point out to such men that some 
library experts consider it well to keep down expenses for cataloging 
and housing books by weeding out libraries. Perhaps they are right. 
Whether they are so or not, however, their objection is too late. The 
matter now under consideration is undergoing public discussion, and it 
is important that men having special knowledge of library matters 
should contribute now the results of their experience. Unreasonable 
men in town meetings and in boards of trustees must be answered, and 
reasonable men and women need to understand thoroughly the subject 
in order that their answers may be discriminating and wise.

  700 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Once, when the Librarian of Congress asked that an addition be 
n ade to the library rooms, a member is said to have urged that instead 
of enlarging the Capitol, the library should be weeded out. Such a 
plan would be regarded generally as exceedingly foolish. 
There must be in many parts of this broad land large and growing 
libraries which will aim to gather very large general and special collec- 
tions not limited to books of intrinsic merit. Such libraries will have 
to get many books of little value in themselves to enable students to 
study subjects historically. It would indeed be very silly to weed out 
the Congressional Library. Somewhere there should be accessible (and 
where better than in that library?) every book, pamphlet, and map 
published in the United States. The Congressional Library should be 
a great national library like the Bibliothéque Nationale and the British 
Museum. 
The Quincy plan would not work well even in a place the size of 
Worcester, Mass., with a population of only 90,000 or 95,000, and but 
44 miles from Boston, for it is a center of important educational insti- 
tutions and of inquirers, and therefore needs large reference libraries. 
Cambridge, though very much nearer Boston than Quincy, becomes, 
because of Harvard University, a center where there must be a large 
library. It is too great an inconvenience for Harvard professors: and 
students to rely, except for book -rarities, on libraries even so near as 
those in Boston. 
On the other hand, consider the John Adams Library at Quincy. It 
was collected by President John Adams in Europe and America, and 
undoubtedly contains many valuable books. But is it in place in 
Quincy? It was formerly kept in the Adams Academy, but not prov- 
ing useful there, it was transferred to the Thomas Crane Public Library, 
where it now is. Mr. Charles Francis’ Adams recently said that he 
only knew of this John Adams Library having been consulted once in 
forty years, and that then he was himself the consulter. It is more 
convenient for Mr. Adams to make his many researches in the great 
libraries in Boston and Cambridge than in Quincy, and his opinion is 
that this library should be given to the Boston Public Library, where 
it would be of great value in supplementing the collections, and would 
be readily accessible to the class of students who would use it. Per- 
haps, however, Quincy would be unwilling to give up this library, 
which marks its ‘connection with a very distinguished man, While it 
is a distinctive feature of the Quincy plan not to make the public 
library a special reference library, its success depends on having large 
reference libraries near at hand. In one respect it encourages making 
the library a special library, namely, on local interests and history. 
As to the saving in expense possible under the Quincy plan, while 
money is saved which would ordinarily be used in housing books and 
in other ways, increased expenditure, it should be remembered, is con- 
templated in frequent issues of improved catalogs. As I shall soon 
show, the plan, if well carried out, requires other expenditures.
-P-A-G-E-711
THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 3 701 
There are many small libraries which do not need weeding. If a 
library needs weeding, as many undoubtedly do, will it be weeded out 
wisely? 
Broad-minded intelligence is needful for this kind of work, as well 
as education and experience in library work. An expert is as much 
needed in this work of weeding out as in selecting books for a library 
at its start. Great harm might result from injudicious discarding. 
Another objection likely to be made to the Quincy plan is that it 
would often be difficult to decide how large a library is needed in a 
town or city, and that this difficulty would be magnified in a growing 
town. Still, if a thing is desirable it should be done in spite of diffi- 
culties. Foresight must be exercised and generous provision made for 
the probable growth of towns, and the number of volumes changed 
as changes in the size of population or other considerations demand. 
Supposing a mistake has been made, the weeding has been made with 
the accessibility in view of large and special libraries in towns and 
cities near by. Those towns and cities will still remain near to the 
town which has grown unexpectedly large; their libraries will still be 
accessible for reference. The difference between the old state of things 
and the new is likely to be that the books will be used more under 
changed circumstances than formerly. 
But how provide under the Quincy plan for students who can not 
afford time and money to frequent the large libraries even in towns or 
cities near by; and supposing this number of special inquirers becomes 
considerable, can you hope that they will receive a cordial welcome and 
sympathetic assistance in large neighboring libraries? Dangers here 
hinted at must be guarded against. Librarians and trustees should be 
on the lookout for inquirers and help them to get at the books needed. 
It is proposed to help them by preparing and issuing often impioved 
printed catalogs. Personal assistance would also evidently be needed. 
under the new plan. In some cases it would be necessary to buy books. 
In others the investigator might be introduced to the officers of the 
library, or by some influential person to the officers of a large neighbor- 
ing library with reference to his being allowed to borrow if he could not 
use books on the premises. The same thing might perhaps be better 
accomplished by a loan from the large to the small library. The small 
library might have to pay for this privilege. It might be desirable, if 
an investigator had leisure but not money, for the small library to pay 
his car fare to the town where the library to be consulted is situated. 
Large libraries as now constituted are very obliging, and continually 
extend courtesies to smaller institutions. The people of Worcester, for 
example, every week, and sometimes oftener, have books borrowed for 
their use from the Surgeon-General’s library, Washington, from Harvard, 
the Boston Atheneum, Columbia, Yale, and other libraries. Many insti- 
tutions are already extending gratuitously such privileges. 
Supposing it were to become the custom of small libraries to send 
books and pamphlets which they can get, but do not need, to large
-P-A-G-E-712
  702 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
neighboring libraries where they would be useful. Such acvion would 
lead to an exchange of various civilities. Then, too, as the desirability 
of haying large libraries help smaller ones by loans of books becomes 
more and more obvious, will not persons of means give money to the 
former to enable them to Re this kind of work for small towns generally 
or for particular towns in which they may be specially interested? 
Mr. Adams’s advice to libraries is, not to accumulate books pro- 
miscuously, but to practice a systematic differentiation in collecting. 
Books which cumber the slielves of one library may be of the greatest 
value in another. The publie documents only of its own town and 
State, and a few of the national documents relating to matters of gen- 
eral interest, are in place in the library of asmall town. But all public 
documents. have come to be of the greatest service in large libraries 
and in libraries connected with important educational institutions. 
Even those which seem driest, because exclusively of statistics, are 
much in demand in colleges where students of history and political 
economy are required to examine original sources. 
Mr. Charles A. Cutter said’ several years ago, regarding the proper 
disposition of pamphlets, that local pamphlets should be given to local 
libraries, professional or scientific pamplilets to special libraries, mis- 
cellaneous and all sorts of pamphlets to larger general libraries. This 
is excellent advice. 
Even large general libraries: practice differentiation, many of them 
excluding professional books and leaving special libraries in their 
neighborhood to accumulate them, A: State library may properly make 
a specialty of public documents, and perhaps law books, and pay little 
attention to accumulating other books. A general subscription library 
with a constituency mainly of people of Jeisure may find it more useful 
to collect books in belles-lettres, biography, history, travel, ete., than 
to buy many dealing with industrial subjects. But a publie library in 
a great manufacturing town, or a special library for architects and 
engineers, must specialize on technical books. 
It is not proposed to destroy books taken out of libraries where they. 
are not needed, but to place them within reach of those most needing 
them, either through other libraries or auction rooms or secondhand 
bookstores. No countenance would be given to such a proceeding as 
that of the administrators of the estate of the well-known collector of 
old books, Mr. T..O. P. H. Burnham, who are said to have sent a to2 
or more of material from his stock to the paper mill. 
The people of Worcester act more wisely. They empty their attics 
into the rooms of the American Antiquarian Society or those of the 
  
1It is conceivable that after a lifetime of buying whole attics of rejected books 
and preserving those which no one would buy at any price, out of an immense stock 
there might be a ton of duplicate schoolbooks, incomplete volumes, and other books 
and pamphlets which could not even be given away to any hbrary; since the large 
libraries would have copies and the smaller ones would not esteem them worth shelf 
room.—M. D.

local Society of Antiquity. Housekeepers there, too, dispose similarly 
of such books as turn up in spring cleaning and are found to be in the 
way. An extensive system of exchange is in operation under the 
auspices of the former society, and books and pamphlets sent to the 
rooms of either society, find their way to persons and libraries where 
they are needed, and the two antiquarian societies enrich their collec- 
tions by the exchanges made. 
Col. Thomas Wentworth Higginson recently stated that a trustee of 
the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, told him that he spent a considerable 
part of his time in refusing gifts offered to the museum. This trustee 
is probably wise in declining gifts. There are many books and pam- 
phlets offered to libraries which they would not find useful. These 
should be accepted only on condition that they may be placed wherever 
they will be most valuable. 
Differentiation is specially desirable in the smallest libraries. When 
but little money is available for buying books the small amount should 
be spent with closest regard to actual needs of the constituency. Not 
infrequently intelligent entertainment and elementary instruction will 
be the principles that should guide in selecting books for small libraries. 
With intelligent cooperation several small neighboring towns might 
adopt to advantage the suggestion that each of them spend a few dollars 
ayear on a specialty, such as botany, geology, zoology; every town 
taking a different specialty and all lending to one another. 
This paper favors in the main the selection of books with special ref 
erence to the actual existing needs of the users of the library. Such an 
institution as the flourishing public library of Providence, R. L., might 
properly, if allowable for any library in cities of moderate size, add to 
its general work some specialty of limited interest. Mr. Foster, its 
librarian, has recently stated, however, that he thinks that notwith- 
standing the reputation which the famous Harris collection of poetry 
gives to the library throughout the country, it is the best for that 
library to devote itself almost exclusively to supplying the general 
needs of Providence. 
In conclusion, it may be stated that Mr. Adams does not claim that 
the plan of weeding out libraries adopted at Quincy has never been 
thought of before. He was not indebted to any book for the idea, but 
it had occurred to other persons before. Action upon it had always 
been recommended. Mr. Adams has taken the bull by the horns. He 
has put the plan in execution and to a considerable extent has sys- 
tematized it. He has also called attention to it and made it a living 
subject for discussion.

704 _ EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Ards To LIBRARY PROGRESS BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES. 
By A. R. Sporrorp, LL. D., Librarian of Congress. 
Whatever may be the opinion of librarians or of the public as to the 
adequacy of the service rendered to libraries by our Government, it is at 
least certain that it has been enough to call for worthy recognition at our 
hands. While it can by no means be affirmed that the Government has 
been consistently liberal, it would be equally untrue to assert that it 
has been consistently niggardly. The Congress of Senators and Rep- 
resentatives, which is alone responsible forthe opening and shutting of 
the national purse strings, is a continually changing body, of brief offi- 
cialtenure. It results that a certain caprice or uncertainty attends the 
making of appropriations for scientific, educational, and specially for 
literary objects. 
The enlightened and large-minded men whose zeal for the widest dif- 
fusion of knowledge through libraries may lead to generous legislation 
in one Congress may not be reelected to the next. 
I will venture to lay it down as a postulate that this Government of 
the people owes to the libraries of the country all the aids which a due 
regard for constitutional limitation will allow. Such aids should by no 
means be confined to libraries at the seat of Government, which may 
seem to be more peculiarly within its cares. The most obvious and 
practically useful means of extending such aids is a wider and more 
complete distribution of all books printed at the expense of the Goy- 
ernment. This method, being but a simple extension in the interest of 
public intelligence of legislation for more than half a century on the 
statute books, ought also to be more free from cavil and objection than 
anyother. A thoroughly digested system of such enlarged distribution 
has been often put before the committees of Congress through the aid 
of this association, and just as often has been rejected, or has failed of 
passage in one or the other House of Congress. The reasons of these 
repeated failures, complex as they are, have been fully treated by the 
members of successive committees of our members in charge of this 
subject. 
In this summary of what has hitherto been done in aid of libraries, 
complete details can not be given. But I may properly mention some 
of the more remarkable contributions which have been made to public 
libraries through the agency of Congress, in the form of publications 
notemanating from any Department or Bureau of the Government, and 
hence not constituting documents entering into the ordinary channels 
of distribution. By far the most costly and extensive publication ever 
undertaken by the Government was the narrative and the scientific 
results of the United States Exploring Expedition round the world, in 
1838-1842, under the command of Capt. Charles Wilkes. This vast 
undertaking, though strictly limited to an edition of 100 copies, and
-P-A-G-E-715
  THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 705 
never completed, cost this Government from first to last $242,460.55. 
This enormous sum was of course exclusive of any expenses of the 
expedition itself, and covered— 
(1) The labor of many scientific experts in various fields; 
(2) The finest engravings which the art of that day could supply; 
(3) The choicest paper, of heavy satin finish; 
(4) The hand-press work of the best printers, and 
(5) Binding in the heaviest and most durable of Turkey morocco, full 
gilt. 
Eighteen volumes of text in quarto, and 11 folio atlases of maps 
and plates were finished up to 1861, when Congress, already more than 
impatient at the renewed and heavy demands for money to carry on a 
work of which none could predict the ultimate cost, brought it to a 
close by refusing further appropriation. 
The 100 sets printed were by law distributed thus: 34 copies to for- 
eign Governments; 1 copy to each State in the Union; 6 copies to 
specially designated institutions or individuals; the remainder to be 
reserved for future States when admitted to the Union. Repeated fires 
in priting offices consumed 30 copies of certain volumes before distri- 
bution could be made, so that even the meager diffusion of the work 
to libraries was never fully carried out. Still, it is to the credit of the 
liberality of Congress to have engaged, in those days of small things 
and of strict construction, in putting into permanent literary form the 
scientific results of an exploration which had awakened world-wide 
interest. The original sin of the undertaking lay in limiting the edition 
to 100 copies, and sending all the American distribution to libraries at 
State capitals, and nowhere else. Thus, Albany has a set of this great 
exploring expedition, while New York City has none. Columbus, Ohio, 
is endowed with the costly volumes, but Cincinnati scholars can not 
see them without traveling 100 miles. Jefferson City has a set, laid to 
sleep under dust year by year, while St. Louis has none. Springfield, 
Ill, in its State library, has these rare and precious volumes, perhaps 
never consulted with serious purpose by one visitor in a year, while 
the great metropolis of studious research, Chicago, can not show a copy 
of one of the most notable of purely American books. This remark- 
able history of a Government’s doing a very liberal thing in a very nig- 
gardly way, adds point to the suggestion that if only 100 more copies 
had been printed, their distribution would have supplied every library 
in the United States at that day having 5,000 volumes. This added 
number would have cost merely the price of paper and presswork—a 
mere trifle in comparison with the vast sum squandered in diffusing 
much less than half the benefit. 
Besides, the Government might have printed for a much wider dis- 
tribution the five-volume Narrative of the United States Exploring 
Expedition, a popular and interesting work, published only by private 
enterprise. In short, this mismanaged and truncated publication is to 
ED 93——45 
 
-P-A-G-E-716
706 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
be instanced as a model to be avoided in future undertakings of a 
similar nature. 
Among other notable Government contributions of special value to 
libraries have been Force’s American Archives; or, Documentary His- 
tory of the American Revolution, the publication of which extended to 
9 volumes in folio (1837-1853); the American State Papers, 38 volumes 
folio (1832-1861); a republication of important Government and Con- 
gressional reports and documents, from 1789 to about 1837; Commodore 
Perry’s Narrative of the United States Expedition to Japan, 3 volumes 
quarto (1856); the Writings of Thomas Jefferson, 9 volumes (1853), 300 
sets of which went to libraries and institutions of learning; the Madi- 
son Papers, 3 volumes (1840), and his writings in 4 volumes (1865); the 
Charters and Constitutions of the United States, 2 volumes (1878); and 
the collection of French documents, entitled “Découvertes et Etablisse- 
mens des Frangais dans ’Ouest et dans le Sud de PAmérique Septen- 
trionale,” 1684-1754, edited by P. Margry and printed at Paris in 6 
volumes (1876-1886); and the Annals of Congress; or, Debates and 
Proceedings of that Body from 1789 to 1824, 42 volumes, octavo, (1834- 
1836), of which 300 sets were distributed to libraries and other public 
institutions. 
Worthy of our highest recognition is the circulation at Government 
expense of the extensive work on the Publie Libraries of the United 
States; their History, Condition, and Management, published by the 
Bureau of Education in 1876. This was followed by a distribution of 
the second part of the work, Rules for a Dietionary Catalogue, by 
C. A. Cutter. The Statistics of Publie Libraries in the United States, 
printed by the Bureau of Education in 1886, and about being issued in 
a new edition to 1893, adds another signally useful publication, widely 
given to libraries all over the world. 
The action of Congress in making books imported for libraries free of 
duty is another service, which, though long delayed, merits our hearty 
commendation. 
There should be added to this regulation something which our asso- 
ciation has long sought but has not seen realized—a greatly redueed 
rate of postage on library books sent through the mails. 
Another service to libraries, both at home and abroad, rendered by 
our Government, and not so widely known as it should be, is the annual 
defraying of the cost of foreign exchanges through the Smithsonian 
Institution. Though the principal credit for this widely useful system 
by which American libraries may send abroad, and foreign libraries to 
the United States, books to institutions of learning, is of course due 
to the Smithsonian Institution and the admirable system established 
by it, yet Congress has latterly devoted thousands of dollars toward 
the expenses of the exchange, where before it devoted hundreds. It is 
to be added that the library of the Government reeeives the custody 
and use of the publications annually received as the fruit of exchanges 
by the Institution of its own publications. 
 
-P-A-G-E-717
THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 707 
The Government has further benefited the libraries of the country 
by printing, at its own expense, for years past— 
(1) The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, founded 
in 1863; 
(2) Annual Reports of the American Historical Association (since 
1889); and 
(3) Annual Reports of the Smithsonian Institution, full of valuable 
scientific papers. 
All these enjoy such distribution to public libraries as is provided 
for regular Congressional documents under existing laws. 
Another and more direct aid to libraries by Congress is to be found 
in the foundation and increase of the various Department and Bureau 
libraries. at the seat of government. The most extensive of these 
special collections is the library of the Surgeon-General’s Bureau at 
the Army Medical Museum, numbering 104,300 volumes. The claborate 
catalog of this collection, the largest assemblage of ‘publications on 
medicine, surgery, and hygiene in the world, has been printed wholly 
at Government expense, costing, up to date, for printing and binding 
about $174,000, aside from the cost of its preparation. 
Beside the national collection in the Library of Congress, the Goy- 
ernment has also founded and extended the following Department 
libraries:

There are also many minor collections of books in various bureaus. 
All of these have been built up by Congressional appropriations. 
But the most extensive outlay for library purposes by our National 
Government has been the establishment and constant increase of the 
Library of Congress, more appropriately designated by Jefferson “the 
Library of the United States.” This name was bestowed on it in his 
catalog of 1815, when his library, bought by Congress, constituted 
the entire collection. A more limited designation appears to have been 
preferred by Congress in that day of small things, before any idea of 
a national library had dawned on the legislative mind, and has natur- 
ally been perpetuated in the statutes. Beginning with the modest 
appropriation of $5,000 in 1800 “for the purchase of such books as may 
be necessary for the use of Congress at the city of Washington,” etc., 
 
-P-A-G-E-718
  708 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
the library grew very slowly for half a century, till, in 1851, a fire in the 
Capitel consumed all but 20,000 volumes of the collection. Congress, 
with praiseworthy liberality, at once appropriated $75,000 in one sum 
for buying books and $72,500 for rebuilding the interior in solid iron. 
Up to 1893 the appropriations for books and periodicals have aggregated 
nearly $800,000, about $150,000 of which represents the replacement 
of books destroyed by two fires. 
Another provision of law by which our national library is steadily 
enriched is the system of international exchanges. Fifty sets of all 
Congressional and executive documents and other publications of the 
Government are annually set apart to be furnished to foreign govern- 
ments in Europe and America. The returns, though fragmentary and 
incomplete, have brought to the Library of Congress many thousand 
invaluable accessions, not only of parliamentary and legal publications, 
but of scientific and literary works. 
One principal source of the rapid growth of the library of the United 
States has been, and will continue to be, the copyright publications, 
which are deposited therein in pursuance of the law conferring exclusive 
rights of publication, coupled with the requirement of two copies of each 
work protected by copyright for permanent deposit at Washington. 
This law, though very imperfectly complied with prior to 1870 (when 
the business of keeping all copyright records was transferred to Wash- 
ington, and has since formed an integral and laborious part of the 
duties devolved upon the Librarian of Congress), since then has become 
a most important means of enriching the library. The wisdom of the 
legislation which established the system is amply attested by the valu- 
able accessions annually accruing; and in view of the fact that the 
great government libraries of Europe owe so large a proportion of their 
invaluable stores to the copyright privilege, it is manifest that the 
law of growth of our own national library is coextensive with the 
literary and scientific development of the country which it represents. 
The service rendered to the world of letters by the preservation in a 
fireproof repository at the seat of government of an approximately 
complete series of the nation’s literature can be best appreciated by 
librarians, who know by experience how rapidly books tend to disap- 
pear from the market, till it is literally true that many works owe to 
public libraries their sole chance of preservation. 
The wise and liberal provision, after years of delay, for a separate 
library building of the most ample dimensions, of absolutely fireproof 
materials, and on a plan combining utility and beauty in a high degree, 
is most creditable to the ultimate judgment and liberality of Congress. 
The extent of accommodation for books will be 4,500,080 volumes, and 
the limitation of cost $6,000,000, to which is to be added the sum paid 
for the site, $585,000. Three more years will witness the completion of 
a library edifice which, for capacity, for convenience, and for architec- 
tural beauty, promises to be worthy of the nation and of the age.

BRANCHES AND DELIVERIES. 
By GEORGE WATSON COLE, 
Public librarian, Jersey City, N. J. 
The success of any library, be it reference or circulating, may be prop- 
erly measured by the extent of its use. Anything which will help to 
increase its use, therefore, must tend toward its success. Reference 
libraries, no less than circulating, may,do this by enlarging the num- 
ber of volumes and making them specially strong in certain lines, thus 
attracting to their use those interested in them; in other words, by 
specializing in selection. As the success of a reference library depends 
on increasing its readers, this can only be brought about by extending 
as widely as possible information as to its resources. 
The public or circulating library must use all these means to secure 
readers, but is not restricted, as is the reference library, to drawing 
readers within its portals. Experience has shown that many people 
who will not go far out of their way to secure books for home reading 
will use a library if its books can be brought conveniently near to 
them. The reader needs stimulating, and in order to reach him in 
towns covering large areas, or having distinct centers of population, 
several enterprising libraries have established branches or delivery 
stations, at points sufficiently accessible to overcome this natural inertia 
inherent in the general reader. 
As yet little attention has been paid to this phase of library manage- 
ment either by the American Library Association or in the Library 
Journal. It has therefore been necessary, in order to secure data for 
an intelligent treatment, to communicate directly with all such libraries 
as from their size, character, location, or surroundings were judged 
most likely to have adopted either or both these means of increasing 
their usefulness. 
The list of libraries from which information was asked was carefully 
selected from the United States Bureau of Education’s List of Libraries, 
1886; the third report of the Free Public Library Commission of Mas- 
sachusetts, 1893, and Greenwood’s Public Libraries (3d edition, 1890), 
which named a number of English libraries that had adopted branches.

Librarians were also requested to send all information as to their 
methods, and also add any remarks more fully explaining their differ- 
ent systems. 
From about 175 letters sent out, affirmative replies were received from 
47. Hither from want of statistics or a want of appreciation of the 
information desired, many replies furnished little of value as to meth- 
ods pursued and results attained. 
Outside of Massachusetts and New York, there is hardly a State of

aids to circulation. 
Of libraries reporting branches, eight report 1 branch, five 2 branches, 
three 3 branches, two 4 branches, two 5 branches, one 9 br. ee one 
13 branches, or a total of 67 ee iahien: 
Of libraries reporting delivery stations, five report 1 station, three 2 
stations, four 3 stations, two 4 stations, two 6 stations, three 10 stations, 
one 11 stations, one 30 stations, making a total of 114 deliveries. 
Of those reporting both branches and delivery stations, one reports 1 
branch and 2 delivery stations, one 1 branch and 6 delivery stations, 
one 4 branches and 4 delivery stations, one 8 branches and 14 delivery 
stations, giving a total of 14 branches and 26 delivery stations.

That more libraries have not adopted branches or delivery stations 
is because their establishment is an experiment, evolved in the growth 
of the free public library system. 
The libraries in this country, as elsewhere, have passed through sey- 
eral stages, of which this is one of the latest. Where branches or

THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 713 
In the first stage of library development more attention was paid to 
amassing a creditable collection of books than to putting it to a prac- 
tical and extensive use. The library, looked at from this standpoint, 
became a mere storehouse where information might be found by a 
privileged few, provided they knew where to look for it themselves, 
which was extremely doubtful; or provided the custodian of the col- 
lection could put them on the track of the information for which they 
were in search, which, considering the lack of suitable arrangement and 
catalogs, was highly improbable. Such collections of books began to 
be formed in this country contemporaneously with the founding of 
our older institutions of learning, and to this highly commendable 
spirit we owe most of our large reference libraries, of which the college 
and State libraries, and those of historical and other societies, having 
for their particular aim the collecting of books on special subjects are 
excellent types. The primary aim of these libraries was to meet the 
needs of a restricted class—scholars and students of special subjects— 
rather than to cater to the intellectual requirements of the general 
public. 
The second period or stage of library development was begun when 
attention was first called to organizing public libraries about forty 
years since. It was the leading principle of the originators of this 
class of libraries that much might be done for the cause of education 
and for the entertainment of the general public by libraries having for 
their primary aim the circulation of books for home reading. As the 
people were to be beneficiaries it was but another step in this move- 
ment to decide that these libraries should be established and main- 
tained at the expense of those for whose benefit they had been called 
into being. Thus rose the laws for the founding and maintenance of 
public libraries by taxation. 
In this country the Boston Public Library stands foremost as a type 
of this class, and its history is the history of the free public library 
movement which forty years ago began to stir not only this country but 
England. Following, as it did, the first stage of library development, 
its promoters naturally adhered strongly to the ideas which had pre- 
vailed respecting the functions of a library down to that time. We 
therefore see in its Bates Hall the great importance attached to its ref- 
erence department. 
The free public library idea spread rapidly in New England, and 
especially in Massachusetts, till now no town or city government is con- 
sidered to have performed its duty to its citizens unless it has pro- 
vided them with a tax-supported public library. 
So great are the advantages which have risen from founding public 
libraries that the policy has rapidly spread throughout the country, 
and to-day we see libraries springing up in nearly every town and city 
where they have not heretofore been established. This impulse has 
been greatly accelerated by the wide-reaching work of the American 
Library Association since its formation in 1876, and its active career  
-P-A-G-E-724
714 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
has doubtless done more to advance the cause of the free public library 
movement in this country than all other causes combined. 
Those having the management and care of our public libraries at 
heart have come to realize that the mere fact that a town or city has 
a well-equipped library, from which the public are free to draw books 
for home reading, does not necessarily mean that all the requirements 
for its most successful operation are fulfilled. A prominent librarian 
has well said that the time has come when it is as unreasonable to 
require the people of a large town or city to depend on a single library 
from which alone they can draw their books as it is to require them to 
buy all their groceries or meat at one store or market, or that they 
shall all attend the same church. 
This spirit has brought about the third stage of library develop- 
ment in which its promoters aim to carry the library and its benign 
influences to the very doors of the people. This stage is one of recent 
growth; it might perhaps be more accurate to say it is even now in its 
formative period, for outside one or two leading libraries, branches 
and delivery stations are creations of the last few years, and are even 
yet in their experimental state, though in nearly every case srekeeng) 
surprisingly gratifying results. 
No reference was made to this phase of library effort in the 1876 
report on public libraries, exhaustive as was that document, and we 
look in vain for much light on this subject in the Library Journal, 
which contains the fullest history of the libraries of this country that 
can elsewhere be found. 
While it is generally admitted that in towns or cities of large area 
or haying distinct centers of population the benefits of branches or 
delivery stations are great, there is difference of opinion as to which 
is better. In many places the difference in expense settles the ques- 
tion of itself, as delivery stations can be successfully carried on at a 
far less cost than branches. It may be questioned whether, in cases 
where funds permit a choice, it is good policy to use public money in 
building up a series of branches, which are largely counterparts of 
each other and of the main library; thus scattering funds in forming 
several small libraries, rather than in building up a strong central 
library. 
Branches and delivery stations are managed in various ways: 
1. Delivery stations.—We find the delivery station pure and simple, 
where books are collected and sent to the main library, and are there 
exchanged for new ones which are returned to the station where the 
borrowers get them. All accounts are kept at the library, the station 
being only a conduit through which books are sent and received. 
The library reporting the largest number of delivery stations, with- 
out other appendages, such as reading rooms or reference libraries, is 
the Jersey City Free Public Library. This library first opened 7 sta- 
tions, October 1, 1891. Their number has since been increased till  
-P-A-G-E-725
  THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 715 
now 11 are in successful operation, They are located from 1 to 4 miles 
from the library. Collections are made in the morning, and deliveries 
in the afternoon of the same day by a hired delivery wagon. About 
$2,000 a year is now paid for transportation. The station keepers are 
paid one-third of a cent for each volume, or borrower's card, returned 
to the library. ‘The total circulation for the year ending November 
30, 1892, was 172,225 volumes, or 49.9 per cent of the total circulation 
for home reading. The total cost of maintaining these branches was 
$2,230.54, an average of nearly 1.3 cents a volume. 
2. Distributing agencies.—The plan suggested by the New Hamp- 
shire board of library commissioners-uses what may be called distribut- 
ing agencies, in distinction from delivery stations. Enough books to 
meet requirements are sent to these agencies at stated intervals, say of 
one, three, or six months. For the time being these form the stock of 
the agency, and are distributed to borrowers and returned to be circu- 
jated again and again, till they are replaced by a new supply from the 
main library. While they are at the agency all accounts with the bor- 
rower are kept there independently of the main library. 
The first report says: 
One of the most troublesome questions arising in many towns whenever the estab- 
lishment of a library is advocated is that of location. Local jealousies are stirred 
up afresh and sometimes with the result of hindering the establishment of a library. 
In several cases, where there were two or more villages in a town thero has been a 
disposition to establish an independent library in each village. It has been the 
policy of our board to recommend the establishment of one central library, and then, 
if it was found necessary to have some better facilities for the distribution of books, 
that distributing agencies be established as might be convenient. In this way all 
records could be kept at the central library, and whenever books were transferred to 
the agency the same could be charged and then credited when returned. 
The manifest advantage of such a system is that the library accounts could be more 
accurately kept than if the libraries were more or less independent; and, agair, the 
exact location of every book could at any time be ascertained at the central library 
(p. 11, 12). 
Then follow resolutions and rules relating to their operation. 
One small library only, the Leicester (Mass.) Publie Library, reports 
this plan in operation. It originated at that place in 1869, and there are 
four agencies, which have been in operation ever since. These agencies 
are not strictly such as are planned by the New Hampshire commission, 
inasmuch as if is reported that they have “a very few permanent 
volumes.” The town numbers 3,000 inhabitants, and the total annua] 
income for library purposes is but $480. About 60 volumes are sent 
quarterly to each of its four agencies. This interesting case shows 
what can be done in small towns with limited incomes. 
The publie library at Cleveland, Ohio, and also that at Milwaukee, 
Wis., is successfully carrying on a similar work, but uses schools instead 
of agencies as distributing points. A full account of the working of 
this plan is given by W.H. Brett, librarian of Cleveland, in a paper on 
“The relations of the public library to the public schools,” read by him
-P-A-G-E-726

before the department of superintendence of the National Educational 
Association, held in Brooklyn, N. Y., February, 1892. This paper is 
printed in full in the proceedings, and has been separately reprinted. 
3. Delivery stations with reading rooms.—Probably the best, and 
certainly the largest, example of delivery stations, at which are reading 
rooms and a small library containing only books of reference, is that 
of the Chicago Public Library. This library has 30 delivery stations, 
located at from 1 to 7 miles from the library. Collections and deliv- 
eries are made the same day by four delivery wagons, each of which is 
paid $1,350 a year. The station keepers are paid $10 a month for 500 
volumes or less; $2 a hundred from 500 to 1,000 volumes, and $1 for 
each 100 volumes over 1,000. The total circulation through the deliv- 
ery stations during the year ending May 31, 1893, was 422,812 volumes, 
or about 43 per cent of the entire circulation, the average cost of circu- 
lating each volume being about 2.87 cents. 
At six of these branches are reading rooms, each containing a file of 
from 80 to 100 periodicals, and from 500 to 1,500 volumes for reference 
use only. These were maintained in 1892-93 at a total expense of 
$12,114.51. 
4. Branch libraries.—We find branch libraries pure and simple, or 
those that circulate their books independently of the main library, but 
which report to it, and whose borrowers are permitted to use it when- 
ever they wish to do so. ; 
The best example of this class is the Enoch Pratt Library, of Balti- 
more. This library was started in 1886 with four branch libraries, 
costing $50,000; a fifth has since been added. 
These branch libraries are in different quarters of the city, from 2 to 4 
miles distant from the central library. They are stocked with 45,363 
volumes, or more than half as many as are in the main library at Mul- 
berry street, which contains 77,410 volumes. ‘These branches therefore 
represent an expenditure of not far from $100,000. Two assistants and 
a janitor are employed in each branch at an annual cost of $840. The 
buildings will hold about 15,000 volumes each, but it is proposed to 
limit the number to 10,000. This limit has already been nearly reached. 
The reading rooms are supplied with from 20 to 30 current periodicals, 
but newspapers are not taken, A few reference works are also pro- 
vided in each. 
During the year ending January 1, 1893, there were circulated from 
these branches 184,500 volumes, or a little over 40 per cent of the entire 
circulation of the library, which was 452,733 volumes. A comparison 
of the average expense of circulating each volume would be interesting, 
but want of suflicient data prevents this being given. 
The librarian, Bernard C, Steiner, believes in delivery to branches, 
and intends to introduce it, in which case he would probably buy fewer 
books directly for the branches, thus keeping the number of volumes 
in the branch libraries within the proposed limits.
-P-A-G-E-727

5. Combined branch libraries and delivery stations.—The most | 
prominent of the few examples of this combined system is the Boston 
Public Library. It carries on 8 branches and i4 deliveries. There are 
jn these branches 139,281 volumes, ranging from 32,410 in the Roxbury 
branch to 11,192 in the South End branch. In these branches 42 per- 
sons are employed as librarians and assistants. In their reading rooms ; 
the best monthly and weekly illustrated papers are supplied, and each 
branch is provided with good cyclopedias, dictionaries, and other works i 
of reference. Fourteen delivery stations are conducted in connection i 
with the main library and its branches. Deliveries are made not only 
to the delivery stations, but also to the branches, in strong boxes, sent 
out daily by express. The station keepers are paid $250 a year for serv- 
ices, rent, and light. In some of the deliveries are reading rooms. 
During 1892, there were distributed through the branches and deliveries 
479,632 volumes (if we read the report correctly) out of a total circula- 
tion for home reading of 719,063. 
In, this case the establishment of branch libraries was not undertaken 
till after the main library had amassed a collection of over 150,000 
volumes, thus having a strong central library with which to begin its 
extending work. The gradual growth of the city by the annexation : 
of its various suburbs gave it an opportunity of bringing under its 
management the various libraries which had previously been independ- 
ent. This was of great advantage to the smaller libraries, as practi- 
cally they added to their own resources those of the public library, 
which was many times their size. 
Unless the parent library is already firmly established and has a 
large and strong collection of its own, with abundant financial support 
to carry it on successfully, as in this case, it may not be wise to scatter 
‘ its funds in forming branches. No city seems better adapted by geo- 
graphic conformation and various centers of population for carrying on 4 
successfully a system of branches and delivery stations than Boston, 
yet the librarian, T. F. Dwight, thinks that were the work to be begun 
anew he would employ delivery stations only. 
Other means of increasing the usefulness of libraries, of an analogous 
nature, are carried on by many libraries, such as the departmental 
libraries in colleges and universities. There is, however, this distine- 
tion, the departmental library is the setting aside in a convenient loca- 
tion of books relating to a special subject or group of subjects for use 
by those making special studies in those subjects, e. g., chemical books 
in a laboratory, botanical works in an herbarium, or books on political 
economy in its class room. This does not contemplate that the books 
shall be duplicated in the main library; it is rather a practical seques- 
tration to make them more useful or convenient to those specially inter- 
ested in them. 
Branch libraries, on the contrary, while not actually contemplating 
a duplication of the central library, really become so to a very great 
extent. 
 
-P-A-G-E-728
  718 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Another means of creating interest in books and their use is illus- 
trated by the traveling libraries now sent out from the State library in 
Albany to different parts of New York. This method is analogous to 
the distributing agencies recommended by the New Hampshire State 
library commission, but has a larger area of usefulness and is designed 
primarily to stimulate an interest in reading and the eventual founding 
of libraries in the places to which they are sent. 
To sum up, it seems to be the generally accepted opinion, so far 
as can be discovered from the libraries making use of either of these 
systems or their variants, that in large cities or towns where exist- 
ing libraries can be brought under the management of a strong, well- 
equipped, and efficiently managed public library. the arrangement is 
for their mutual advantage. 
If, however, the enterprise is a new one, it is thought by many a 
much better policy to confine the collection of books to a single main 
library, making it large and strong in works which individuals can 
not afford to buy for themselves—expensive art works, scientific and 
technical works, sets of periodicals, publications of learned societies, 
dictionaries of various languages, ete. A library thus thoroughly 
equipped is a power in its community, and may then well become a 
point from which distribution can be made to different localities within 
its area by deliveries and agencies. 
The question as to the best system for any particular library to follow 
must, therefore, be largely one of policy, governed by local requirements 
and the means which the library can command.! 
HEATING, VENTILATION, AND LIGHTING OF LIBRARIES. 
By Normanp 8. Patton, Architect, Chicago, Tl. 
The problem of heating, ventilating, and lighting libraries does not 
differ essentially from the same problem in other buildings where peo- 
ple congregate. Therefore it is not a library problem, except in some 
special applications, and it is not so important to know the opinion of 
librarians on these topics as that of architects and sanitary engineers. 
Iwill try to give, in condensed form, the opinions of the best authorities 
on heating, ventilating, and lighting, not as a scientific treatise, but as 
practical hints, to which will be added a consideration of the portions 
of a library which require special attention and where mistakes are 
most likely to be made. 
fpicuaion brought ont the great disadvantage of the delivery sation as com- 
pared with the branch, for it left out the personal work in guiding reading which 
is so vital to the best results, also that after a hard day’s work people will go to a 
reading room in a branch near home when, if there were none nearer than the central 
library, they would stay at home or drop into a neighboring saloon. If means allow, 
the best plan seemed a branch with reading room equipped with reference books, 
periodicals, and a small stock of general literature and, most important, with a 
skillful attendant to give needed personal assistance in selection, But this more 
thorough provision is clearly much more costly than the delivery station.—M. D.

HEATING AND VENTILATION. 
These topics can not be considered apart from each other, because 
all the air brought in for ventilation in cold weather must be heated, 
and the kind of heating apparatus used has much to do with the system 
of ventilation that accompanies it. A perfect system will give inde- 
pendent control of the heating and ventilation, so that any room may be 
heated with or without ventilation, or ventilated with or without heating. 
This separate control of heating and ventilation is necessary because 
the two are not needed in the same relative proportion in different 
rooms, or in the same room at different times. Thus, if the number of 
occupants in a room be increased, the ventilation should be increased, 
but the heat diminished. 
Heating.—Heating is to offset cooling. A building is cooled in two 
ways: (1) By loss of heat through outside walls, windows, and roof; (2) 
by introduction of cold air for ventilation. The ordinary rules by which 
steam fitters figure the size of their apparatus are based on the cubic 
contents of the building. These rules are utterly useless and mislead- 
ing, because in buildings continuously heated, the cubic contents has 
no more to do with heating than has the color of the librarian’s hair. 
‘When a cold room is first warmed, the whole volume of air and the 
substance of walls and floors must be heated, requiring an excess of 
heating over what is needed to maintain the temperature once gained. 
For this reason there must be a reserve power that can be called on to 
heat up quickly, as on Monday morning if the building has been cold on 
Sunday. When the air in the building is once heated its volume does 
not concern us; we need only restore the heat it loses. If a partition 
stands between two rooms, both of them warmed, it can not cause a loss of 
heat. The only walls that cooi a room are those exposed to the weather. 
A large room exposed only on one end and having two windows would 
require less heating than a room say one-third the size exposed on two 
or three sides and having four windows. The glass of the windows, on 
account of its thinness, loses more heat than the thick walls; a square 
foot of glass losing as much heat as 5 to 10 square feet of wall surface. 
The amount of heat required by various rooms, aside from the ventila- 
tion, will be in proportion to the amount of glass surface and its equiv- 
alent in exposed wall surface. Steam-heating contractors generally put 
enough radiation in a building, but fail to distribute it properly, over- 
heating some rooms while others are cold. Attention to the above 
principle will avoid this result. The roof often allows great loss of 
heat. Walls are thick and usually have air spaces, but roofs are often 
thin, permitting escape of heat in winter and admitting it in summer. 
Roof plank should be 2 to 3 inches in thickness, and a tight floor laid 
in the attic to retain the warmth in the rooms below.  
-P-A-G-E-730
  720 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Our second source of cooling is the air admitted, whether uninten- 
tionally through the cracks, or intentionally as ventilation. This air 
must be heated. Ventilation costs in proportion to its efficiency.! 
Apparatus.—The method of heating is often decided by the money 
available. The best method is by hot water. Its advantages over 
steam are: (1) A perfect control of temperature in all kinds af weather 
without use of complicated attachments; (2) greater economy of fuel. 
Steam is either boiling hot, or there is no steam at all. Therefore, in 
mild weather, the building, if heated at all, is overheated, with a cor- 
responding waste of fuel. 
For a building of moderate size, a hot-air furnace is by nozneans to 
be despised. It will give better ventilation than steam or hot water, 
as ordinarily put in, and is much cheaper in first cost. 
Still another method of heating deserves to be better known—the 
combination of hot air and hot water. This is obtained by inserting a 
water-heating coil into a hot-air furnace, and connecting it with radia- 
tors. This retains all the advantages of the hot-air furnace and adds 
the direct radiation which can be carried to points too distant to be 
reached by hot air. It is intermediate in cost between hot air and hot 
water, and is more economical of fuel than hot air alone. 
Ventilation.—The amount of ventilation depends on the number of 
occupants of a room. In order to maintain a proper purity of atmos- 
phere, there should be supplied not less than 30 cubic feet of air per 
minute for each person. As the air in a ventilating duct rarely moves 
more than 300 feet per minute, it will be seen that we require a venti- 
lator about 1 foot square for every 10 persons. If gas is used for light- 
ing, additional ventilation is required; each gas burner being counted 
equivalent to 5 persons in vitiating air. Ifa reading room is occupied 
for several hours at a time, no less than the above amount of air should 
be provided; but if a room is large in proportion to the number of 
occupants, and is occupied for only a short time, we may allow for the 
large volume of fresh air with which we start, and reduce ventilation 
somewhat. 
The book room being large in proportion to the number of occupants, 
the leakage around the windows may provide sufficient air, or windows 
ean be opened where the draft will not be felt; hut if many are admitted 
to the shelves, it will be well to provide for changing the air once or 
twice an hour. 
Taking up the question of the means of producing the desired ven- 
tilation, there are several important principles to be observed. First, 
air will not move unless positive force is applied to it. To build a 
ventilator will not necessarily make ventilation. The forces used to 
move air are two: first, the mechanical method by~means of a fan 
  
1The thermostat attachment for automatic regulation of the heat was commended 
by several who had found it very useful. Warnings were given from others against 
heating through the floor. The apparatus was difficult to get at, and those com- 
pelled to stand or walk over the heated surface found it uncomfortable.—M. D,  
-P-A-G-E-731
  THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 721 
driven by a steam engine or other motor. When an electric current 
can be obtained, a fan driven by this power gives a convenient and 
positive means of ventilation. We may use a fan to force in the fresh 
air or to exhaust the foul air, or in large buildings we may use both, 
thus getting a most complete control over the air currents. Such an 
apparatus can be used as well in summer as in winter, and is so pow- 
erful that high velocities can be secured in the air ducts, thus reducing 
their size and cost. The second and more usual method of ventilation 
is by the draft of a heated column of air. We need artificial veutila- 
tion when the outside air is cold; and in this case a flue, such as that 
of a fireplace, will have an upward draft. If such a flue be favorably 
located and surrounded by warm rooms, it will be a fairly efficient ven- 
tilator and give a velocity from 180 to 300 feet per minute, according to 
its height, temperature, and size. The higher and hotter a flué, the 
more rapid its draft, and the larger its area, the less the retardation by 
friction. Butif the flue be in an outside wall where it is chilled, it 
will probably give a downward instead of an upward draft. In sucha 
case the flue must be heated by a fire, as in a grate, by steam pipes in 
the flue, by placing the ventilator next to the chimney or other source 
of heat, or by having gas jets in the flue. 
With this system of ventilation, the fresh air is brought in by the 
draft of the heating apparatus—either a hot-air furnace or a so-called 
“indirect” radiator, which is a coil of steam or hot water pipes iu the 
basement, through which the fresh air is forced; or a third method the 
“direct-indirect” radiator, which stands in the room to be warmed and 
radiates heat from the surface, while in the center are flues to which 
air from outdoors is brought in a duct, and when heated is discharged 
at the top of the radiator. 
The system of ventilation by natural draft has the disadvantage that 
the forces producing the air current are not very powerful, and there 
is danger that at times the current will be reversed by the wind. If 
the wind were constant in force and direction, we could use it as a 
means of ventilation; but we can in any case make the wind counter- 
act its own mischief. If the tops of the chimneys and ventilators are 
earefully located so as to avoid adverse currents, the wind will aid the 
draft. We can also make the wind force air into the building through 
the heating apparatus, by arranging air inlets on all sides of the build- 
ing, joining in a common chamber, and fixing in each inlet automatic 
valves which admit the air, but prevent its escape. 
In determining the location of the inlets and outlets for the air, it 
should be borne in mind that the foul air does not rise to the ceiling or 
fall to the floor, but diffuses rapidly through the whole room. The hot- 
test air, whether fresh or foul, will always rise to the ceiling, and the 
coldest air, whether fresh or foul, will fall to the floor. From this it 
follows that if we are to keep a room warm, we must take out the foul 
air at or near the floor, and if we wish to cool the room we must make 
ED 93——46

  722 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
an opening near the ceiling. Theinlets may be in the floor or in the wall 
at any height; the main point to be observed is to prevent an unpleasant 
draft on the occupants. There is the least danger from drafts where 
the inlets are in the floor, the principal objection to this arrangement 
being the accumulation of dirt in the registers, When there is a fire- 
place, it is well to let it act as the ventilator, proportioning the size of 
the flue to the amount of ventilation required. A gas log placed in 
such a fireplace will provide an immediate increase of heat, and thus of 
ventilation on special occasions, while ordinarily the natural draft will 
suffice. 
For rooms not larger than 20 by 30 feet a single inlet and outlet will 
give good ventilation; for larger rooms it is well to draw the foul air 
from several points; for very large rooms there should also be several 
inlets; but one ventilator that ventilates is better than ten that do not; 
and it is often better to make one ventilator very efficient by the appli- 
cation of heat or mechanical power, than to increase the number with- 
out such assistance. The system of ventilating ducts to be adopted is a 
matter of convenience ineach case. Noone system is Dest for all cases. 
When each room has its independent flue, there is the least danger of 
one room drawing the air away from another. When the small ven- 
tilators are united into a general shaft, they should be continued up 
independently the height of one story, so that each will have its inde- 
pendent draft before they are united. In any system as much air must 
be admitted to a building as is drawn from it; otherwise if the supply 
be reduced, the ventilators will draw against each other and cold air 
will descend in some of the ventilators to supply the others that have 
amore powerful draft. Those libraries which have the books arranged 
in stacks several stories high inside a lofty room present a problem of 
unusual difficulty in the ventilation. The hot air tends to accumulate 
at the top and is destructive to the books as well as to the readers. If 
this hot air be not contaminated by the burning of gas, the evil can be 
mitigated by producing a circulation of the air, taking advantage of the 
chilling effect of the windows to make a descending current on the out- 
side walls while fresh air rises in the center to take its place. In sum- 
mer the ventilation of such a room should be taken from the top. 
No ventilating apparatus can adapt itself to the varying conditions 
of the weather. There must be an intelligent supervision of the ven- 
tilation or the best system will fail. 
  LIGHTING. 
The most difficult part of the library to illuminate by day is usually 
the delivery desk. This difficulty comes from the fact that the counter 
where books are delivered should be near the center of the building. 
One solution is to place the counter near enough one outside wall to 
geta strong side light. Front light is to be avoided. Frequently there 
seems to be no other help than a skylight. This is very effective when
-P-A-G-E-733

it can be used. The objections are the liability to leak and the heat 
that accompanies the light in summer. 
The lighting of other parts of a library offers no special difficulty, 
provided the rooms are small; but when we have areas of considerable 
width special care must be taken. The one important fact to bear in 
mind in lighting large areas is that the light shines downward from the 
sky; therefore it is only the upper portion of a window that can light 
far back into a room. If we increase the width of a room beyond the 
ordinary we must increase the height also so that the windows may be 
carried up high enough to throw the light back to the farther side. 
As there is always an excess of light near the windows, we may increase 
the lighting of a room by raising the windows higher without increas- 
ing their size. This raising of the windows leads to several architee- 
tural developments of importance. 
If the windows are 7 feet or more from the floor, the entire wall 
space may be used for bookcases. This is a common arrangement for 
book rooms and is sometimes adopted for reference books in a reading 
room, as in Yale University. The reading room at the University of 
Michigan has also windows high above the floor. If the roomis made 
still higher, and the windows raised in proportion, we may be able to 
build a low addition against the outside of a book room, keeping the 
roof of this addition below the windows, and use the space thus gained 
for librarian’s room, cataloging, ete. 
A variation from this arrangement is to remove the wall between the 
main room and the side addition, and substitute a row of columns, 
using the space thus gained as an addition to the book room or reading 
room as the case may be. 
If we inspect this final result of our development of the elevated 
window, we shall discover that we have no new form but that familiar 
type of building which the Romans used for their basilicas, and after- 
wards the Christians for their cathedrals, and I may add we moderns 
for our factories. This method of lighting is used in the reading room 
of Cornell University, but it is as yet not generally known as available 
for library architecture. This idea, which may be called the basilica 
plan, is capable of a much wider application than has yet been given it. 
Passing to the question of artificial light, the book room requires 
special arrangements to find any book without using an extravagant 
number of lights. I recommend chandeliers or ceiling lights, sufficient 
only to give a moderate general illumination; supplemented by moy- 
able search lights in each aisle between cases, to be turned on only 
when a book is sought. As to kind of light, the electric is by all means 
best. First, because it does not vitiate the air. The burning of gas in 
a reading room renders the problem of ventilation doubly difficult, and 
in the book room it injures the bindings. The objections to gas are so 
great that if electric light can be procured, the difference in cost should. 
not be considered. The electric light (incandescent of course) lends  
-P-A-G-E-734
  724 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
itself to economy in the book room from the ease with which it can be 
turned out and lighted again. A switch at the end of each bookcase 
may light one or more fixed lights in the next aisle, or the lamp may 
be attached to a flexible cord, long enough to reach any book, and 
turned on only when in use. 
When the books are arranged in a stack several stories high, with 
glass or perforated floors, light may come either from the side or from 
above. The side light will not penetrate the narrow aisles between the 
cases more than about 20 feet effectively. Therefore, if there is side 
light only, the stack room must not be more than 40 feet wide if lighted 
on both sides, but may be of any height. If skylights are used, the 
light will not penetrate through more than two floors, and the stack 
can be only three tiers high, but may be of any width. 
A combination arrangement can be made with cases more than 20 
feet in length lighted at the outer ends by side windows, and at the 
inner ends by a central court covered by a skylight. % 
FIRES, PROTECTION, INSURANCE. 
By R. B. Poors, 
Librarian Young Men’s Christian Association of New York. 
The destruction of a rare collection of books is more to be deplored 
than the loss of almost any other species of property. 
The final cremation of the Alexandrian Library in the seventh cen- 
tury is an event as notable almost as any in history, and the loss of its 
700,000 rolis is more keenly felt to-day than ever, when scholars are 
searching old libraries and monastic vaults for missing manuscripts 
and for documents heard of but never seen by men of this age. We 
ean only picture in imagination what lacune would have been supplied 
in sacred and classical literature, had this vast treasury of learning, 
the spoils of the victorious Amru, been presented to John the Gram- 
marian, who asked for it from his willing friend, the conqueror. But 
the Arabian general was subordinate to the Kalif Omar, and the greatest 
library of antiquity was sacriticed to bigotry, if we may credit this 
ancient story. 
The destruction of the Roman Empire carried with it the annihila- 
tion of many libraries, yet Gibbon remarks, “Our treasures, rather 
than our losses, are the object of my surprise.” 
Constantinople, from an early period in the Christian era to the 
invention of printing, was the great literary center of the East, and 
many libraries in Europe have been enriched from her storehouses. In 
the century succeeding the burning of the Alexandrian Library, it is 
related, though with some grains of doubt, that the Emperor Leo III, 
the iconoclast, burnt ‘a considerable library at Constantinople, and it is 
further added that he burned the librarians, too. It is undoubtedly 
true that fire did a destructive work in this great literary emporium 
before its surrender to the Mohammedans in 1453.

THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 725 
Loss by fire in the early centuries of our era, when books were mul- 
tiplied only by the hand of the copyist, was often irreparable. The 
destruction of a manuscript meant, often, the loss of the only extant 
copy, or one of a very limited number, which could be reproduced only 
at a great expense. The printing press introduced a new age, and 
the power of the fire fiend was broken. Copies of early codices were 
printed in numerous volumes, and acquired a wider diffusion; still, that 
diffusion in the early days of printing was limited, and to-day incuna- 
bula are the great treasures of modern libraries. . A fire in a library of 
to-day would not be as disastrous as in the ages before printing, unless 
we except such great depositories of MSS. in Europe as the Bodleian, 
the British Museum, the Bibliothéque Nationale, and the Vatican. 
Still, every important library has works that are unique, or if they 
exist in duplicate, are unprocurable. Collections exist which represent 
the labor and search of many years, and are a unit in themselves. 
We can name only a few celebrated fires in libraries since the days 
of Gutenberg, and before this last half century. The Augustinian 
Library, at Mainz, was totally destroyed in 1649. The great library of 
the Escurial, at Madrid, was partially burned in 1671. In 1685, the 
library of the Canons of St. Antonio, at Venice, was destroyed by fire, 
and in 1697, the Royal Library of Stockholm. In the next century, 
1731, the libraries that formed the basis of the British Museum, the 
King’s Library, and the Cottonian, were partially burned, when 97 
manuscripts were totally destroyed, and many more charred or 
scorched, The archducal library of Brussels was burned the same 
year. The ‘great fire at Moscow in 1812 involved the destruction of 
its great library. The Library of Congress was fired by the British in 
1814, and in 1851 was reduced to 20,000 volumes by fire. There have 
been a number of fires in the last two decades. In 1873, the Manches- 
ter (England) Antheneum Library, containing 19,000 volumes, was 
burned. The most disastrous fire of this period was the burning of 
the Birmingham Free Library, January 11, 1879. The loss was about 
$300,000. The library had in its reference department 50,000 volumes, 
and contained the great Shakespeare Memorial Library, besides other 
special collections.    
The Welsh University library, the most valuable collection of books. 
in Wales, was totally burned in 1885. The free library of Newcastle- 
on-Tyne suffered to the extent of $5,000 from fire in 1884, from over- 
heating the ventilators with gas lights. The Brussels University 
library lost 65,000 volumes in a fire in July, 1886. In 1890 the great 
library of the royal family of Belgium, at Lacken, was burned, and in 
the same year the University of Toronto was cremated, the loss being 
24,000 volumes. 
Fires in libraries in this country have been significant in numbers, 
rather than in disastrous results in the last twenty years. In 1873 the 
Indiana University library, containing 15,000 volumes, was. destroyed
-P-A-G-E-736
726 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
by fire caused by lightning striking a telephone wire. The Mercantile 
Library of Philadelphia suffered serious damage in 1877 from water 
used to extinguish a fire in an adjoining building. Fifty-five thousand 
volumes were injured, for which $42,000 was recovered. The books 
were not an entire loss, as they could still be read, though stained. 
A kerosene lamp was the cause of a fire in Hobart College, Geneva, 
N.Y., in 1885, by which “ many valuable books that can not be dupli- 
cated” were destroyed. The public library of Fall River, Mass., lost 
6,000 volumes in 1886. The insurance was carried by the city. In the 
same year the law library of Minneapolis was burned, also the public 
library of Princeton, Ind., and a part of the high school library of 
Yonkers, N. Y. The public library of Peoria, Ill., on March 25, 1888, 
had 30,000 volumes damaged by water.and improper handling. The 
insurance was only $8,700. The building of the Young Men’s Chris- 
tian Association at Twenty-third street and Fourth avenue, New York, 
was seriously burned July 28, 1889, while the library was not injured; 
the fire ran up the elevator within 15 or 20 feet of it. The library at 
Colchester, Conn., valued at $5,000, was burned in 1890. The same 
year, in Maine, the library at Lewiston (11,000 volumes, insured for 
$6,000) was destroyed, and the Rockland public library and the Skow- 
hegan library. 
This brief résumé of fires, past and present, while far from complete, 
is sufficient to prove the imminent danger to which libraries are 
exposed from fire, and that the principles of protection should be 
thoroughly studied and applied in library architecture. 
In accordance with the general plan of the papers for this manual, 
this topic should treat: (1) Of the points on which as librarians we 
are agreed, and (2) of those which occupy debatable ground. 
While it may not be practicable to set forth this subject on these 
precise lines, still the theory or the practice of leading librarians may 
in a measure be formulated. Statistics for this purpose have been 
gathered from 56 libraries, 50 of which contain upward of 25,000 vol- 
umeseach. The 56 libraries reporting have in the aggregate 6,225,721 
volumes. Thirty of these libraries, containing 2,473,074 volumes, give 
a valuation of $4,651,875. The 26 not reporting value embrace some of 
our richest collections, and number 3,729,624 volumes. The entire value 
would doubtless reach $11,000,000. Official figures (1893) show that 
there are in the United States 3,804 libraries containing over 1,000 
volumes, and that these libraries have a total of 31,171,354 volumes; 
the libraries reporting will therefore represent about one-fifth of this 
total, but undoubtedly a much larger fraction of value. 
POINTS OF AGREEMENT. 
1. Libraries generally regard it wise to insure. Of 56 reporting, 35 
insure their books, 11 (generally State and national libraries) do not, 
_while 10 make no report on the subject. Thirty-three insure their
-P-A-G-E-737
  THE WORLD'S LIBRARY CONGRESS. T2E 
books separate from their building, insuring 3,018,370 volumes for 
$2,090,754. The amount covered by insurance in different libraries 
will vary from about 33 to 75 per cent of the total valuation, falling 
probably below 50 per cent on the average, alow figure. Premiums 
on libraries vary about 309 per cent. In discussing at Chicago the 
policy of insuring, it was thought by some that a library financially 
able should carry its own insuranee, particularly if it was supported 
by the city or State.! 
Of the 56 libraries noted, all except 5 own their buildings, and 39 
give valuation as $8,755,617. Insurance figures on these buildings are 
not very complete or satisfactory. Official records show that there are 
986 libraries in the United States owning building: 
2. Librarians believe their books should be stored in fireproof strue- 
tures, and are building, so far as means will allow, on fireproof prin- 
ciples. Absolutely fireproof buildings are costly, and a substitute for 
them is often the only alternative. As an indication of the practice on 
this point, 22 libraries report fireproof buildings, while 5 buildings are 
so called, 11 are partly fireproof, and 18 are not. These buildings are 
generally constructed of brick, or more commonly of brick and stone. 
Interior construction in these buildings is not so decidedly fire resisting. 
The floors in most cases are made of fireproof materials, as fire brick, 
wood Jaid in cement tiling, iron girders and brick, ete. Wood enters 
largely into the construction of the cases (37 so reporting), a construction 
not as objectionable as it might seem, provided floors and partitions 
are properly protected. Iron is used more in balconies and stairs. 
Special attention has been given by this association to architecture. 
At the Cincinnati conference in 1882 the first report on this topic was 
made. Five years later Mr. Larned reports that 18 libraries had been 
completed in the two previous years, and that 23 were in progress, 
many being fireproof. Two years later Mr. Van Name, at the St. 
Louis conference, reported 55 buildings completed, or under construc- 
tion. Some allowance should be made for overlapping. He notes that 
the buildings for our best treasures are to be fireproof, there being 13 
such. Many were the gifts of private individuals. 
To illustrate the advance made since 1876 in the erection of fireproof 
buildings we quote comments made respecting the Birmingham disaster 
in 1877: “The loss by the Birmingham fire,” said the New York Trib- 
1The insurance companies charge the whole amount of the risk plus running 
expenses plus their profits. Therefore the premium is greater than the risk, and 
wealthy cities and towns, like wealthy merchants, may insure themselves at a profit, 
and in the long run greater eare is taken of uninsured property. Usually the same 
appropriation can be had for the library whether it uses part of it for insurance or not, 
and in the rare cases of fire the city or town makes a special appropriation to replace. 
Those who urge most strongly the greater economy of this method also admit that 
it would be unwise for any librarian or trustees to omit insurance unless they first 
secured the formal approval of the authorities, thus forestalling the violent criti- 
cism sure to be made in case of a heavy loss.—M. D.

une, ‘is a lesson to us on this side of the ocean of the necessity of pro- 
viding absolutely safe structures for our own precious collections, many 
of which are undoubtedly in constant danger of conflagration, and are 
not contained in structures worthy of being called fireproof at all.” 
Justin Winsor, referring to the preservation of books and to the same 
fire, said: “Too large a proportion of such edifices of to-day ignore 
utterly this consideration.” Many so-called fireproof buildings of 1876 
would not pass inspection as such to-day. 
Bad construction has been the rule rather than the exception in our 
public buildings till recent years, and to-day we are far from emancipated « 
from its influence. F. C. Moore, president of the Continental Insurance 
Company, New York, and an authoritative underwriter, in a brochure 
on “Economical fire-resisting construction,” says: “It may safely be’ 
assumed that fully 40 per cent of the losses of this single company, 
and therefore of every other, are due to incorrect construction of build- 
ings. This means that nearly $50,000,000 worth of property is destroyed 
annually in this country which might be saved if our methods of con- 
structing buildings were more nearly correct.” 
Edward Atkinson, the economist, in an article in the Century, Feb- 
ruary, 1889, entitled “‘Slow-burning construction,’ says: ‘The worst 
examples of combustible architecture are to be found among our pris- 
ons, hospitals, asylums, and almshouses; next among college buildings, 
libraries, and schoclhouses.” Quoting from the Insurance Chronicle, he 
says that in 1887 126 colleges and libraries were burned. The libraries 
‘referred to were undoubtedly not of great value and poorly protected. 
Risks on the better protected libraries are good. Speaking of libraries 
the tna Insurance Company, of Hartford, says: “We consider the 
most desirable risks those that are kept on iron racks, or in iron cases, 
in fireproof buildings; libraries in buildings of ordinary construction 
are not considered very desirable risks.” The Liverpool, London and 
Globe respond, “We find libraries, as a rule, profitable risks.” 
There were some reasons, and cogent ones, too, why library build- 
ings, as well as other structures, in the few decades past were so ill 
constructed. Architecture as an art was almost unknown then in this 
country; technical schools had not been established in which archi- 
tecture was taught, and the country was not prepared to adorn its 
cities and towns with edifices that combined, with beauty and solidity, 
qualities of construction that would make them absolutely fireproof. 
In place of the old fire traps, which were a menace not only to the 
books but to the librarian and his readers, fireproof buildings are rising 
all over the land, ornaments to city and town, and safe depositories of 
the collections they are gathering from year to year. 
The question was asked, “Is your building and are your books bet- 
* ter secured from fire than in 18762” Twenty-six replied, yes. Hight 
of the remainder were established since. 
3. The importance of keeping records or inventories of libraries, 
which can be used to prove value, is appreciated as shown by returns.

Only six report no records usable for such a purpose. Methods for 
protecting these records are considered below. 
4, Nearly all libraries report appliances for extinguishing fires, as 
hose, water pails, fire extinguishers, fire axes, etc. 
The British Museum has a fire brigade composed of members of its 
staff, with a code of rules for their government. (See Lib. Jour., 4: 52.) 
UNSETTLED QUESTIONS. 
While libraries are being constructed more and more on tested fire- 
proof principles, it is also true that these principles are of recent 
adoption in many particulars, and as yet not fully comprehended nor 
put in practice by all. These may be briefly set forth, substantiated 
by authorities. 
1. Two prime principles enter into the construction of a fireproof 
building: (1) It should be fireproof without and (2) uonfire communi- 
eating within. 
Material formerly supposed to be fireproof has failed under the test. 
To have said a few years ago that iron and granite were not fireproof 
would have made one a laughing stock, but granite in the Boston fire 
of November, 1889, crumbled into sand; and iron is no longer considered 
safe unless covered with fireproof material. It has been said that there 
was not a fireproof building in the track of the great Chicago fire. 
The Boston fire of 1889 was checked when it reached “the brick wall 
and iron shutters of a building of superior construction.” 
Brick stands first among building materials in fire-resisting qualities. 
Prof. G. P. Merrill, curator of geology in the United States Museum, 
in his work on Stones for Building,' page 356, says: 
Data are not at hand for estimating accurately the comparative enduring powers 
of various stones under these trying circumstances. It seems, however, to be well 
proven that of all stones granite is the least fireproof, while the fact that certain 
of the fine-grained siliceous sandstones are used for furnace backings, would seem to 
show that if not absolutely fireproof, they are very nearly so. 
Professor Winchell places fire-resisting stones in this order: (1) Mar- 
ble, (2) limestone, (3) sandstone, (4) granite, (5) conglomerate. 
Since the days of elevators the roof has proved to be one of the most 
exposed parts of buildings, because of the draft through the shaft. 
A fire beginning in the basement is drawn at once to the roof, which, if 
hollow-and combustible, is in a few moments a mass of flame. The 
roof should be constructed to prevent drafts of air within it, and should 
be of fireproof material, as metal, porous terra-cotta metal, and covered 
fire brick. 
2, A building of fine, solid, fireproof exterior may yet be a fire trap. 
“The first principle to be observed,” says Mr. Moore, the underwriter, 
“with a view to resisting fire, is to exclude air drafts from those por- 
  
‘New York State Museum Bulletins No. 3 (out of print) and No. 10, on Building 
Stone in New York, are also of value in this connection.—M. D.
-P-A-G-E-740
  730 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
tions of the building which are vital to its endurance, viz, floors, roof, 
partitions, ete. Into all these wood may safely enter if drafts be pre- 
vented by incombustible material, such as mortar or cement.” A fire- 
proof building will be so constructed inside as to consist of distinet 
compartments, separated by partitions of brick, terra cotta, ete., while 
its floors will be laid in cement, or be composed of incombustible mate- 
rial, and its ceilings laid on metallic’ lathing, or otherwise protected 
from fire and vermin. Incombustible cases, stairs, and balconies will 
increase the security. 
A basis of rating insurance indorsed by the New York Board of Fire 
Underwriters, National Board of Fire Underwriters, and other boards has 
been prepared and is embodied in the ‘ Universal mercantile schedule.” 
The basis of rating is a standard building in a standard city, and is 25 
cents per $100. On this basis rates vary according to construction and 
environment of each separate edifice. From the schedule of January, 
1893, we quote the requirements of a standard building: 
A standard building is one having walls of brick or stone (brick preferred), not 
less than 12 inches thick at top story (16 inches if stone), extending through and 36 
inches above roof in parapet and coped, and increasing 4 inches in thickness for 
each story below to the ground, the increased thickness of each story to be utilized 
for beam ledges. Ground floor area not over 2,500 square feet (say, 25 by 100); height 
not over four stories, or 50 feet; floors of 2-inch plank (3 inches better) covered by 
seven-eighths or 1 inch flooring, crossing diagonally, with waterproof paper or 
approved fire-resisting material between (if tin or sheet iron between, see deduc- 
tions); wooden beams, girders, and wooden story posts or pillars 12 inches thick, or 
protected iron columns; elevators, stairways, etc., cut off by brick walls or plaster 
on metallic studs and lathing, communications at each floor protected with approved 
tin-covered doors and fireproof sills; windows and doors on exposed sides protected 
by approved tin-covered doors and shutters; walls of flues not less than 8 inches in 
thickness, to be lined with fire brick, well-burned clay or cast iron, and throat 
capacity not.less than 64 square inches if steam boilers are used; all floor timbers to 
be trimmed at least 4inches from outside of flue; heated by steam; lighted by gas; 
cornices of incombustible material; roof of metal or tile; if partitions are hollow 
or walls are furred off there must be fire stops at each floor. 
It may seem strange that wooden girders and posts are recommended. 
Mr. Moore, before quoted, whose work has the commendation of the 
American Architect, says that unless iron girders are protected by 
terra cotta or burnt-clay brick, they are not as safe as wood, provided. 
wooden pillars or girders are 2 inches thicker than required to bear 
the superimposed weight. The charred wood acts as a shield to-retard 
combustion. Iron is treacherous, and under a heat of 1,000° F. or more 
will expand, if not fuse, and if proper allowance is not made for this 
expansion, will throw the walls. Two inches should be allowed at each 
end for a 50-foot girder. The practice now seems to be very general to 
cover iron with hollow brick or other fireproof material, to prevent this 
expansion. 
Further, the building referred to above should have its doors and 
shutters covered with tin. It has been demonstrated that a door of
-P-A-G-E-741
THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 731 
soft wood covered with tin is better than one entirely of iron. Iron 
will curl. Thirty-five libraries report no fireproof doors and shutters, 
and iron is generally used for the purpose. 
Gas lighting is here recommended, but the New York branch of the 
Liverpool, London and Globe Insurance Company, in a letter to the 
writer, approves of electric light. Improved installation is doubtless 
recommending its use. 
The importance of fire stops can not be too strongly emphasized. 
Not all libraries ean erect thoroughly fireproof buildings, but the alter- 
native is not a fire trap for human saerifice. Elevators, hollow parti- 
tions, hollow roofs and floors, and defective flues have in the last few 
years been the means of destroying millions of property and many lives. 
The object of fire stops is to close up all air passages in floors, par- 
titions, ete., with plaster or cement, and thus prevent fires from spread- 
ing from one compartment to another, turning a fire trap into a kind 
oi slow-burning building, and possibly holding the fire till the fire 
engines arrive and the inmates escape. The fire stops can be used 
at little expense, and there can be no excuse for omitting them from 
any except thoroughly fireproof buildings. A slow-burning building 
(technically factory construction) is one in which the wooden material 
is consolidated in such a way that the fire can be held incheck. There 
are no concealed spaces by which the fire can pass from one room to 
another. Every part is open, so that water can reach the fire. Wood 
and iron are exposed to two enemies, dry rot in the one case and rust 
in the other. 
The precautions against fire by exclusion of air drafts and the pro- 
tection of the iron may tend to develop both of these weaknesses. As 
a preventive, beams should be bored, and iron coated with a material 
that is not an active absorbent of moisture, such as plaster of paris and 
eement. Lime mortar is a preventive of rust, as well as of dry rot. 
Wrought.iron is more susceptible to rust than cast iron. The latter 
oxydizes only on the surface; wrought iron is consumed by rust. The 
action of rust on steel is not well known, and yet this material is com- 
ing into extensive use in constructing steel-skeleton buildings, like the 
Masonic Temple, the Woman’s Christian Temperance Building in Chi- 
eago, the World Building, the Plaza Hotel, etc.,in New York. I know 
of no library adopting this style. The advantages are that steel costs 
less than wrought iron, that the curtain walls of masonry, 12 to 20 
inches thick, not being supporting walls, need not be much thicker at 
the base than at the top, thus leaving very much more room on the 
lower floors, a great economic gain.' 
Care of inventories.—Inventories of a library should be kept in safes 
outside the building. This point is emphasized by such companies as 
the Liverpool, London and Globe. “Catalogues,” say they, “should. 
always be kept outside the library building for reference in case a loss 
  
1 See Skeleton Construction in Buildings, by William H. Birkmire (Wiley). 
 
-P-A-G-E-742
    732 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
should occur, showing original cost of books, and as full a description 
as possible.” The Home says: “It is of the utmost importance that 
a complete catalogue of the library should be kept in some safe place 
away from the library itself.” The practice of libraries in this matter 
is not in accord with these recommendations, only 9 keeping their rec- 
ords in safes or vaults outside, while 17 do not protect in the building 
and 10 make no response. Libraries should be managed on business 
principles, and the cost of the books should be recorded and an approx- 
imate valuation of gifts kept, and these records preserved outside, so 
that they can be produced in case of fire. A duplicate accession cata- 
logue of the library of the Young Men’s Christian Association of New 
York is kept outside in safe-deposit vaults. The last catalog is occa- 
sionally taken from the vaults and written up and the copying certified 
by affidavit. 
The Aitna Insurance Company recommends, also, that the record of 
loans in circulating libraries be kept in a safe place. 
3. Fireproof buildings and fire-protected compartments are costly 
equipments, but a closed door or shutter, a pail of water in a con- 
venient place, a watchman’s presence at the moment of peril, may avail 
more than all; and yet these are often considered of minor importance 
till some day it is found that a cup of water, if it had been accessible, 
or a fireproof door, if it had been closed, would have prevented the 
sacrifice of a valuable library. 
Of 56 libraries reporting, 31 have a watchman, 8 others have a jani- 
tor on the premises, while 17 have no such guardian. 
4, With respect to iron shutters, only 16 have them, 8 do not require 
them, while 32 others are without them; 36 have no fireproof doors, 11 
have them, while 7 report them partially fireproof. 
Light should not be shut out from a library for the purpose of lessen- 
ing the hazard of fire from windows, though-this was done in the case 
of a prominent library. 
Insurance companies do not, as a rule, make special arrangements 
with libraries as to settlement in case of loss. Seven only report such 
agreements, as follows: 
a We have, in accord with underwriters’ rules, placed a valuation of $100,000 on 
the collection and insured to 75 per cent of that in order to escape the liability of 
being coinsurers. 
b. Our inventory is to be accepted as issued in our printed reports. 
ce. Files of accession books, etc., are to be proof of value. 
d. Policy requires, in case of loss, itemized list of destroyed articles, sworn to by 
librarian. 
e, Shall maintain insurance upon above-described property to its full cost value. 
f. It is stipulated that we can not recover more than the cost price of books pur- 
chased. 
_ g. A fixed valuation is agreed to as of date of policy. 
Two libraries file a list of rare books or MSS. with the insurers. 
-Eleven libraries of the 56 have had fires, 9 of which were insured.

Fifteen libraries insure imported books in transit, 8.others some- 
times. 
One library effects a floating insurance on books lent to its branches 
for lecture purposes. 
In the conference discussion of this paper it was ascertained that one 
library insured its card catalogs. 
It was said that bookbinders were not responsible for loss by fire 
while books werein their hands. One librarian reported that he insured 
books at the bindery. 
A floating insurance could be effected on books at the bindery by 
making the amount sufficient to cover the value that would be repre- 
sented there at any time during a certain period. 
Fourteen libraries are in more or less jeopardy from water overhead, 
and 11 have suffered in consequence, or from overflows and leaks. 
“If any building,” says Dr. W. F. Poole, “should be practically fire- 
proof, it is a library building,” and “a wooden library building without 
any of the modern fireproof devices is a fire trap and its construction 
a crime.” It may not be possible to erect in all cases a perfectly fire- 
proof building, for that means a liberally-supplied exchequer, but no 
library should be deposited in a building that has not the inexpensive 
safeguards that have been named and are within reach of all. Lower 
rates of insurance will result from added securities, valuable collec- 
tions of books will not be exposed to so great risks, and public confi- 
dence and support may be expected. The library that looks for valu- 
able gifts should have them so well housed and cared for that books 
will be drawn in as well as drawn out.

FIXTURES, FURNITURE, AND FIPTINGs. 
By Henry J. Carr, 
Public Librarian, Scranton, Pa. 
The topics covered by the foregoing alliterative and comprehensive 
heading might, in one sense, be held to include almost everything per- 
taining to a library, except its building or quarters and its stock of 
literature. 
Under certain other heads, likewise assigned for similar treatment 
at this time, however, there is likely to be due consideration of the    
-P-A-G-E-744

necessary appliances connected with each of such particular topies. 
It is proper, therefore, that this paper shall, so far as may be, refrain 
from trenching on those special fields. 
As to any conclusions regarding best methods or the most approved 
forms of a library accessory which may be drawn from current prac- 
tice of the users thereof, it must also be kept in mind that the older 
libraries are more often unable to change, and so of necessity continue 
devices which later libraries free to act at pleasure as carefully avoid. 
Therefore answers to queries, or statistical circulars bearing on many 
library furnishings, are not always the best basis for opinions, nor 
likely to show fully the real progress made in such matters. 
One of the earliest and most effective agencies toward a betterment 
and reasonable uniformity in library supplies grew immediately out of 
the formation of the A. L. A, in 1876, through the acts of its coopera- 
tion committee. The reports of that committee as given in the Library 
‘Journal for several successive years are yet valuable reading for their 
fall discussions of the several matters under study. From the work of 
that committee grew a cooperative supply department (aided largely 
by the personal enthusiasm and persevering support of one person), 
afterwards fostered through various vicissitudes to later and present 
survival as the Library Bureau. 
With no intent to advertise, but rather for convenient reference and 
brevity in the present paper, as well as for aid to seekers, no hesitation 
is felt in citing the ample and comprehensive illustrated catalog of the 
Library Bureau as being both an available and very desirable guide 
in fitting up a library. Little comment will follow herein, therefore, as 
regards the major part of the articles described in that publication, 
since its chief library specialties represent the tested and elaborated 
ideas of ample cooperative experience, and the purchasers thereof may 
reap full benefit with a minimum of trouble to themselves. 
As to the innumerable stationers’ articles used by librarians, the 
personal preference and experience of the particular user must be the 
guide, so that consideration of those items is outside the scope of this 
paper. 
GENERAL PRINCIPLES. 
Good principles to observe in procuring or planning the furnishing 
of a library are: (1) Usefulness and adaptation to the circumstances of 
each particular case, and (2) true economy may often be practiced in 
obtaining the better, though more expensive, article at the outset. 
The limitations of the human form and convenience are no less fac- 
tors in the case, and necessarily have much to do with establishing 
certain sizes and shapes, e. g., a library counter, of a height to match 
certain other decorative finish and woodwork may, in the long run, 
prove an unmitigated nuisance because just too low for convenient 
service standing and too high to use sitting. Undesirable tables with 
massive and elaborate legs and fancy corners, and chairs having

extraordinary seats and terrific backs, are not an unknown thing in 
some libraries where so-called artistic features have been allowed to 
prevail. 
Libraries must almost inevitably be maintained at an extreme of 
economy, therefore every superfluous carving or molding which serves 
as a dust catcher means so much more janitor’s work and consequent:

same interior in light colors. 
BOOK STORAGE AND SHELVING. 
Since the chief feature of a library is apt to be its books, one would 
naturally expect first. consideration given to shelving and like conyen- 
iences for holding them. 
Mr. Gladstone, in his notable paper on “Books and the housing of 
them” (Nineteenth Century, 27, 384-396, March, 1890; also issued sep- 
arately as a pamphlet), has most pertinently said that “The objects to 
be contemplated in the bestowal of our books are three: economy, good 
arrangement, and accessibility with the smallest possible expenditure 
of time.” “His remarks were especially about private collections, but 
the statements apply equally to publie libraries. 
None too much has been printed on this important and fundamental 
matter of providing suitable accommodations for the books. Some of 
the most salient and instructive statements, from the modern American 
standpoint, are by Dr. William F. Poole, his earlier one being on the 
“Organization and management. of public libraries” (United States 
special report on public libraries, 1876), with illustrations. A. subse- 
quent paper is on ‘The construction of library buildings,” read before 
the A. lL. A. at its Washington conference of 1881 (L. j. 6: 69-77; Am. 
Architect, 10,131; and separately by the United States Bureau of 
Education as Circular of Information No. 1, 1881, ete.); and a later one, 
on “Small library buildings,” was read before the A. L. A. at the Lake 
George meeting of 1885 (L.j,.10: 250-256), His ether writings elab- 
orate his well-sustained and progressive views regarding book storage 
and large libraries. 
A careful and comprehensive study of ‘Library she:ving,” by Melvil 
Dewey, with illustrative diagrams, appeared in Library Notes (No. 6) 2: 
~ 95-122, September, 1887, and as such is worthy of note, though others 
may not adopt all his conclusions. 
Height.— Without going into many details, it may now besaid that the 
weight of experience and best practice favors shelving all books within 
reach of an average person. standing on the floor, or at an extreme height 
of 7 feet 6 inches to $ feet. This is true whether for stack construction, 
wall cases, or open ranges in high rooms. In the latter case the part 
of the room above the shelving, and not otherwise used, gives access 
to light and air, which is more essential than utilizing the same space 
for books.

As instanced in recent construction, however, some librarians dee1a it 
wise to carry the shelving up to 8 feet 6 inches, or even 9 feet, with a 
view to having one or two more rows of shelyes all over the library 
for future needs. While the extra high shelves need not be used at 
the outset, they can, by means of bracket steps and handles on the up- 
rights be readily reached and utilized when pressure for space makes 
it necessary. Others having equal or more experience in the use of 
such accessories do not favor them nor find them as convenient in 
practice as in theory. Especially is this true where women or boy 
assistants are concerned, some physicians strongly deprecating the use 
of such steps by women. 
Form.—Using wall surface only is wasteful; on the contrary, book- 
cases of double face approached by aisles on either side give a maximum 
capacity for a given floor area. Center partitions are unnecessary and 
better omitted in such cases, while the shelves can be made movable at 
little, if any, more cost than if all are fixed. If, for special reasons of 
local construction or to provide for future carrying strength, some 
shelves must be fixed, let it be merely those at top and bottom and one 
other at a height of say 3 feet from the floor with all intermediate 
shelves adjustable. 
Dimensions.—Litile difficulty need be had in deciding on some uni- 
form multiple of shelf length for use in a given instance, thus having a 
standard shelf all through thelibrary. Such length when not less than 
2 feet 6 inches nor more than 3 feet is found to be best both as regards 
convenient handling and interchangeability and for an economical cut- 
ting of material. Preferably a medium length of 2 feet and 8 or 9 inches 
will divide up space with good effect.. The advantages to be derived 
from the adoption of such a standard length are many. 
For most books which circulate, 7 to 74 inches gives ample width of 
shelf; and if the shelves are placed at due intervals of height, say 9 to 
104 inches, provision is made for fully 90 to 95 per cent of the books in 
modern public libraries, together with ample space for air and light 
and moderate freedom from dust.! A limited amount of adjustable wall 
shelving 12 inches wide will accommodate the exceptional sized works 
which circulate. 
For reference works, cases having a fixed ledge at say 3 feet from the 
floor are desirable, and may be of either wall or double-faced construc- 
adoption of 75 centimeters, or 30 inches, as the best standard length for ordinary 
shelves, and 93 centimeters or 36% inches for shelves likely to be used for standard- 
size files and pigeon-hole cases. The A. L. A. fifteen years ago adopted a standard- 
size scale by which 25 centimeters is thelargest book marked 8° or O. The result isof 
course the adoption of 10 inches as the standard minimum distance between shelves. 
The ledge suits the average reader best when placed above the three lower 10-inch 
shelves, and if there are five more shelves above the ledge, the total height of the 
case is 7 feet 8 inches. Protracted experiments by the library school have failed to 
find better standards than the above.—M. D.

tion. If wall cases are adopted, make the upper shelves each about 10 
inches and those below the ledge 15 to 18 inches wide; and the latter, 
at least, will prove more convenient if made adjustable. If the refer- 
ence cases are double-faced and approachable from either side, the 
shelves may serve full as well if respectively 2 or 3 inches narrower 
than those against the wall—i. e., 8 inches for those above and 12 to 15 
inches for those below the ledge. 
Need for special cabinets and lockers for rarities and works beyond - 
common size will vary. Rollers, sliding shelves, and revolving tables 
should be used for art and other large books specially exposed to injury. 
Avoid doors, if possible; or, otherwise, if absolutely required, use wire 
screens or grating rather than glass. Hard woods give best results in 
shelf and case construction, but the shelves may be of pine for sake of 
lightness. The edges of all shelves should be rounded; and finally an 
oil-rubbed finish used instead of paint, shellac, or mere varnish alone. 
Storage.—As regards storage in stacks having superimposed cases 
with floors over each tier, or, on the contrary, shelving in ranges. of 
cases but one tier high in open rooms having ample light and air-space 
above, much has been said and plausible arguments can be given on 
either side. The seeming weight of opinion, all things considered, is 
against the stack-room system, despite its compact warehouse facilities 
for large collections of books.! 
If the most recent views regarding open shelves for all are correct and 
prove to be in the true line of library progress, (as the writer and many 
others fully believe), a combination of the double-facing open ranges 
on one floor with the old-time alcove form seems quite likely to prevail 
in the immediate future; but, as frequently happens in all matters of 
library economy, local circumstances exert a determining influence on 
individual practice. Therefore much depends on who goes to the 
shelves as well as on the ground space at command; while economy 
and convenience in service, and in heating and lighting, must be pro- 
vided for as well as book capacity. 
As a general principle galleries are to be avoided as a device of the 
evil one, equally ruinous and destructive both to human life and that 
of the books. In exceptional cases, however, an essential purpose can 
be attained only by the use of a gallery; but experience dves not favor 
such use except under cogent necessity. If in original construction 
open-room storage is provided, with high ceilings and cases extending 
but part way (say 7 to 8 feet), and future necessities absolutely require 
use of the upper space, then let the cases be floored over, and the 
semistories thus made used as independent floors. 
In stack-room construction opinions as to solid or perforated floors 
do not agree; but latest experience seems to concur in favor of solid 
  
'Many leading librarians are equally confident that the great growth in the use 
of stacks in recent years is based on sutisfactory reasons.—M. D,

ones, with ventilation at the ends of cases and possibly along the front 
edges also. 
Windows at the ends of cross aisles are the most practical daylight 
reliance and are sufficient for a reasonable width of building having 
adequate space in the aisles. Skylights are of little value, and prove 
both troublesome and injurious. 
For stacks, as for other library shelving, wood seems really the pref- 
erable material, all things considered. A possible exception may be 
made for floors, which may be stronger, tighter, and more fireproof, if 
of iron. As to first cost, iron is usually though not always more expen- 
sive. Wooden uprights and shelves are generally cheaper than iron; 
and, in turn, admit of better construction and finish, besides looking 
better and wearing the bindings less. 
There are a number of special shelving devices on the market, mostly 
patented, and amply urged by those interested; but time has yet to 
prove their real efficiency, and the item of first cost still stands largely 
in the way of very. general trial of most of them. 
COUNTERS AND DELIVERY DESKS. 
These are usually made to correspond to the features of the particu- 
lar building, and personal preference may be allowed sway in the style 
and interior arrangement of such articles. 
Conforming to average humanity and kindred uses, as in banks, rail- 
road and other public offices, counters where customers are to be served 
standing are most convenient when 42 inches high; this height, too, is 
easy for writing. The same result may be attained by a counter 3 feet 
high having a desk of 6 inches more superimposed. If to be used sit- 
ting, then 2 feet 6 inches is an average most convenient height, as for 
tables and office desks. A counter top should be of fair width, say 2 
feet or more, and project considerably on each side beyond the support, 
thus serving to protect the front from being marred by feet, and also 
making it feasible for clerks inside to sit down. 
Good light at counters and delivery desks, both daylight and artifi- 
cial, is an essential often overlooked. 
TABLES AND READING DESKS. 
For library service the less that architects and furniture designers of 
the “high art” order have to do with tables, desks, and chairs the hap- 
pier is apt to be the result to the steady users of such furnishings. 
Tables.—A substantial construction, plain rather than ornate, and 
not too large or heavy should be the rule. From 29 to 30 inches! is a 
standard height, and casters are not desirable. With a top of 2 feet 10 
  
1Tall people can not sit with comfort at a 29-inch table, and the length from knee 
to floor can not be reduced; but it is easily increased by a hassock for short readers 
who use a higher chair. Some libraries which study comfort most adopt 31 inches as 
standard height and then have adjustable chairs and hassocks so that short and tall 
_ readers are both suited.—M. D. 
   
-P-A-G-E-749
    
THE WORLD'S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 739 
inches by 5 feet, six persons, two on each side and one at each end, may 
be seated without crowding. If 6 feet long it will admit of putting 
three at each side, while for proportion’s sake the width may be 3 feet. 
Slides (or movable shelves), under the top, placed at suitable intervals, 
are often of great service. For smaller tables, those 2 feet 6 inches by 
3 feet 6 inches, and also others 3 feet square on top, prove convenient. 
In rooms for juveniles it may be desirable to make some tables of less 
than standard height, but usually a variation in the chairs accomplishes 
the same object.! 
Reading desks.—Reading desks, as distinguished from tables, are 
more generally made for special instances and are presumably fixed 
rather than movable. Like counters, therefore, they should harmonize 
with the finish of the building and fit the space at command. Dimen- 
sions and heights should be proportioned to the probable users, as before 
suggested. 
Office and cataloger’s desks.—These may be made to order, but 
at present a perfection of style and convenience, at moderate cost, is 
found in many regularly on the market, so that a suitable supply is most 
simple and readily attained.? 
1Foot rests or hassocks ought to be provided, as it is cruel and injurious for a child 
to sit for hours with feet dangling above the floor.—M. D. 
?Much of the ccoperative work which has accomplished so much in the past sev- 
enteen years is due to adoption of certain standard sizes for cards, sheets, blanks, 
and for cases, trays, drawers, and pigeonholes in which they are used or filed. It 
is a period of unprecedented growth in libraries and as a result there has been a 
change of rooms, methods, and fittings to meet the new and larger requirements. 
Convenience and economy make it as important to work by standard sizes as it isin 
a factory. It adds nothing to first cost, but saves time and money at every readjust- 
ment, because the parts often interchange in ways entirely unforeseen at the outset, 
Those who have tested the principle urge its adoption most earnestly. 
Much is accomplished by adopting a series of standard sizes for an individual 
library, but much more is gained without added cost if the standards most widely 
used by other libraries are taken without change, omitting any not needed and sup- 
plying in the very rare cases where some not in the list are really required. Nine 
times out of ten, cne who can free himself from prejudice will find that the standard 
size nearest what he has in mind_is really just as satisfactory as the odd one to 
which he inclines simply because he has become accustomed to it for that use. The 
cooperation committee studied this question at its first appointment in 1876 and its 
work has been kept up by the library school. For many years certain standard 
sizes have been widely used without change and are much the safest series to adopt, 
both because ef their wide adoption by others and more for their merit as represent- 
ing so much experiment and experience. These are, for slips, cards, and blanks, V 
(visiting-card size), 5 by 7° cm.; P (postal-card size), 7° by 12° em.; N (note), 12° by 
20 em.; L (letter), 20 by 25 em. 
The standards most used are P and L. V is used for call slips and compact 
indexes where little goes on the card. C (check size, 2° by 5 em., or just one-third 
V) is used for coat checks, tags, labels, ete. R (receipt, 7° by 20 em.), four V’s 
together, is used for receipts, bank checks, drafts, and fits pockets, envelopes, etc,, 
that hold bank bills. Half this length, or two V’s (75 by 10 em.), is used for cata- 
log or index cards for commercial and other work in which, instead of book titles,

Chairs.—Much the same is true regarding chairs as of office desks. 
Yet for fairly good appearance, durability, and average comfort, prob- 
ably the well-known bent-wood chairs are preferable. The foreign chair 
is stronger and of better finish, but the American make is good and its 
rattan seats often prove more satisfactory than those imported. Some 
patterns of simple dining-room chairs have also been found quite satis- 
factory and serviceable. Wire hat racks placed beneath the chairs at 
small cost serve a good purpose. 
For consulting printed catalogs and lists in the delivery room, a 
counter top or ledge of table height, provided with round-top store 
stools, fastened to the floor at needed intervals, is a convenience. 
Umbrella stands and hat racks.—Tor the former no really satis- 
factory article is regularly “in the trade” of either furniture or hard- 
ware dealers; nor are the usual combined hat and umbrella stands for 
hallways in residences satisfactory for libraries. 
For limited use the foreign made “bent-wood” stands or trees, with 
drip pan on the floor, are convenient and ornamental, without being 
very expensive. Such, with hat holders beneath the chairs, provide 
moderate accommodation without annoying frequenters of the library 
or being much in their way. 
short entries are made, for which 10 cm. give ample length. In the same way I 
(index) size (5 by 12° cm.) was largely used for book titles, though of late years 
very few libraries adopt it, as all cooperative cataloging is based on P size, which 
experience has shown to be much better in most cases. 
L size is the largest that goes on the standard shelf, of which it represents a sec- 
tion 2 em, high and 20 wide. For blank books, letter heads, office forms, manu- 
script for printer, and nearly all uses, this size or something very near it seems to 
have been independently evolved in all sections as most convenient. For printed 
books it is modified to M (magazine size, 17° by 25 em.), so largely adopted by maga- 
zines. This is the largest book that goes on standard shelves. Trimming by binder 
equals squares of boards, so that the bound copy is the same height as the paper. 
This is also a favorite size for library catalog and bulletins. 
The sizes have from the first been given in the international or metric measures, 
which should be followed instead of the rough equivalents in inches, as the differ- 
ence between a card 7 cm. high and 3 inches is y4: of an inch or just enough to prevent 
proper handling of the card catalog. On this account it is unsafe to use catalog cards 
made by ordinary stationers or paper dealers. Their method of cutting usually 
results in variations of 1 mm., or one twenty-fifth of an inch. If a card 1mm. lower 
comes between two of proper height, the finger in turning will bridge from No. 1 to 
No. 3 and No. 2 will be skipped. Novices not understanding this sometimes make 
costly mistakes by failing to get accurately cut cards, which cost much more. 
For pigeonholes and small cases that stand on shelves, 25 em., or the same as the 
shelf, is the standard height. For taller cases the height of two or three shelves is 
taken, when the thickness of the shelf removed may be added. As to length of 
shelves to hold cases, the 75-centimeter shelf, which is best for mere storage of books, 
is much less convenient as a common multiple of the boxes most used for standard 
’ size than is 93 cm., or 36% inches. It is wise, therefore, to use the 93-centimeter shelf 
instead of the 75-centimeter in the librarian’s room, near the loan desk, and in 
corners and other places where desks are apt to be placed, or for other reasons where 
these conveniences may be in demand.—M, D.

For extreme cases and large constituencies, articles of the kind must 
be specially designed.! 
CARPETS. 
Best quality tile or inlaid linoleum (a sort of semicork article firmly 
pressed together), in which the figure of the pattern is carried through 
‘the entire thickness of the fabric, is probably the one most durable 
fioor covering to be had at moderate cost. It is tolerably noiseless 
and when properly laid stands long wear and continual cleaning with- 
out becoming unduly shabby. ‘‘Corticine” and other names describe 
a kindred article; but under either name, figured patterns show dust 
less than solid colors. The lighter the tint, also, the more pleasing is 
its effect and the less it shows dirt. Number 1 (or “‘A”), printed linoleum 
is a cheaper grade, in which the pattern is on the surface only, and will 
answer where there is not too much wear. 
Brussels carpet can be had at no more, or perhaps less, first cost, 
but wears out sooner, and all carpets are so troublesome as regards dust, 
moths, etc., besides needing to be frequently taken up and beaten, that 
it is well to avoid them. 
Mattings of all kinds are very objectionable except for express use as 
dirt catchers in passageways and aisles, where they can be frequently 
removed and cleaned. 
READING ROOM FITTINGS, 
Tables and chairs for readers have been already touched on. Some 
provision must be made for reading current periodicals. Happily the 
day has gone by for secluding all such behind counters, to be handed 
out only on individual call, one by one, An exception, however, may 
possibly be necessary in some larger cities owing to mixed population 
and the influx of a floating and tramp element. Otherwise the several 
monthlies and weeklies kept on file may be put in suitable binders, or 
temporary covers, and displayed either in racks or on tables having 
partitioned intervals or compartment tops; or else in bins or pigeon- 
holes in numbered or labeled cases. Such methods work well and must 
be determined by the room at command and the constituency to be 
served. 
For newspapers, if such are supplied for reading, still different treat- 
ment may be needed. For display on wall racks, to be read in place 
only, there is demanded a disproportionately large standing or sitting 
1 After much unsatisfactory experimenting we found a cheap device called the 
“Midget” best. It consists of two rings 3.5 cm. in diameter attached to a metal base, 
screwed on the baseboard or any piece of furniture. It could be attached to a chair 
leg. A little drip cup 4 by 5 cm. and 4 em. deep hooks on this so that this tiny attach-

It may also be used for canes. Its chief merit is that it takes no room.

area. If in hand files they soon grow inconvenient and unsightly; and 
if in pigeon holes or on call only, they require much care and attention 
or else disappear too early. There is doubt whether the function of a 
public library is more than to obtain and carefully file away for perma- 
nent binding all local papers, without maintaining the average public 
newspaper reading room in this age of overwhelming numbers of cheap 
publications of that kind and the lack of much, if any, benefit to their 
readers. 
SPECIAL APPLIANCES. 
Bulletin boards.—Almost every library finds desirable a bulletin 
board or place for notices. Many make quite a feature of posting lists 
of new books, query lists, and special reading notes, ete. Considerable 
ingenuity may be exercised in such matters from the simple slate or 
blackboard, or tack-sheets of paper, up to an equipment of clips and 
grooved slats in which slips or cards can be placed and removed as 
desired. 
Pamphlet boxes.—Preservation of and ready access to pamphlets 
has likewise made demand for special accommodations akin to those 
given books. Various styles of boxes and wrappers have been tried, and 
satisfaction with any one kind, if attained, has depended much on the 
disposition of the individual user. Where expense and lack of space 
do not stand in the way it is probable that most pleasing results are 
had by means of file boxes or drawers, each fitted with a “follower” or 
“eompressor,” as in the well-known Woodruff and other document files, 
but made of larger sizes for library purposes. 
For dictionaries, atlases, and like bulky works, liberal provision of 
special holders and revolving cases prove both an economy to the library 
and an aid to users. 
Indicators.—Our English and Canadian conferees find more or less 
use for the indicator, and deem it a praiseworthy adjunct to an active 
circulation. Though occasionally tried in the United States our people 
do not usually take kindly to the indicator on either side the delivery 
counter. To most libraries, therefore, the term conveys but a vague 
idea of a machine about which few know and which fewer care to use. 
The space necessarily occupied by an indicator is probably one of the 
greatest drawbacks to its use, if its first cost and expense of operation 
might otherwise be afforded. 
Book trucks.—Some form of book truck is one of the most indis- 
pensable equipments of a modern library, and much true economy will 
result from an ample supply, even if the first cost seems large. Made 
to meet. a limited demand and not in quantities, the usual price is not 
unreasonable, and represents more actual cost and less profit than more 
widely used goods. 
Catalogue cases.—As to catalogue cases and kindred fittings, 
wherein we now have a tolerable uniformity, the rule that “the best is
-P-A-G-E-753
  THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 743 
the cheapest”. holds true in nearly all particulars. To find the best of 
those now made is fortunately not difficult, and in procuring such the 
buyer also obtains the result of an aggregate amount of contributed 
library experience not measured by dollars and cents. 
Much more might doubtless be said on all the foregoing topics and 
on many which have been unnamed. 
Such treatment, however, is more in the province of an exhaustive 
library manual, and needs to be accompanied by numerous illustrations, 
which speak better than words. 
GOVERNMENT, CONSTITUTION, By-LAWS, AND TRUSTEES. 
By H. M. Ure 
  , Public Librarian, Detroit. 
[Pacts in the four footnotes of this article are from comparative library exhibit statistics collected 
by New York State library.] 
Character and mode of maintenance modify details of library govern- 
ment. Those commonly known as public libraries are usually governed 
by trustees. 
BOARDS OF TRUSTEES. 
How constituted.—The number of trustees usually varies from 3 
to 9.' In a few instances there are more, but this increase is usually 
because other interests are to be represented, such as an individual 
founder or some consolidated corporation. In executive management 
a small board is most efficient. An odd number of trustees is advisable 
to avoid possibility of deadlock on any question. The municipal cor- 
poration is usually represented on the board by the mayor or president 
of the board of education, and sometimes by the superintendent of 
schools also, in order to bring the library into closer touch with the 
schools. Women are sometimes chosen and prove well fitted for the 
work. 
How chosen.—In most cases election is by the city council. Some- 
times this is on nomination of the mayor and sometimes without such 
nomination. Election is often by popular vote at annual school or 
municipal elections. In a few cases the matter is in the hands of the 
board of education, who select trustees outside their own body. This 
happens where school libraries have become public libraries. The 
common. practice of choice by city council or by people accords with 
the idea of local self-government and is satisfactory.” 
Term of office.—The trustees are usually divided into groups, one 
group retiring each year. The most common term is three years. A 
10f 63 representative libraries reporting, 18 have 9 trustees; 11 have 6; 9 have 5. 
Small boards are generally the best working bodies. 
20f 6L libraries reporting, trustees of 37 are appointed by mayor, by common 
council, or by mayor and council; trustees of 16 are elected by the people. One 
library reports a self-perpetuating board. The tendency in Western States is for 
common council to appoint directly or on mayor’s nomination. 
 
-P-A-G-E-754
744 EDUCATION. REPORT, 1892-93. 
board of 6 or 9 elected members, 2 or 3 respectively, retiring annually, is 
most popular. In practice there is more diversity in length of term 
than in other respects. There are some advantages in a long term if 
the incumbent is a desirable one. Experience and familiarity with the 
working and needs of the institution are useful here as elsewhere. But 
if the term is short, a valuable member may be reelected and kept in 
the board, while a listless or too officious member may be succeeded by 
some better person.! 
Officers.— Treasurer: If the city treasurer is ex officio treasurer of 
the library fund, the tax for supporting the library is protected by his 
official bond, antl 3 is conveniently drawn on from time to time as needed. 
This is considered the better practice, though sometimes the board 
elects its own treasurer and he draws from the city in a lump sum 
whatever appropriation has been made for the purpose. 
Secretary: The duties of the secretary are usually signing warrants 
on the treasurer, keeping an account of the finances, and recording the 
proceedings of the board. The annual financial statement is made by 
him rather than the city treasurer. He is also the buying agent. Ina 
large library this work must necessarily consume much time. Whether 
a person shall be specially employed or whether the duties shall be 
performed by a trustee or by the librarian must, therefore, depend on 
_ circumstances. 
Librarian: The librarian should not be a member of the board. He 
is sometimes secretary, though opinion is divided as to whether this 
is best. He should attend regular board meetings for consuitation 
regarding the affairs of the library and to give his advice on any con- 
templated action. The term of office varies from one to three years. 
In some instances the term of all appointees is indeterminate, and the 
argument in favor is that by producing a feeling of security in tenure 
of office among employees more earnest and enthusiastic work is 
secured, while the board may drop an unsatisfactory employee at any- 
time. If the librarian is simply custodian of the books, no bond should 
be required of him. But if he is superintendent, executive officer of 
the board, has the management of its business affairs and handles 
much money, he should be treated like other persons employed in a 
' similar capacity. In fact, instances are rare in which the librarian 
gives a bond. He is usually intrusted with at least a small sum of 
money to pay certain petty bills, such as expressage, postage, ete., and 
renders an account monthly of his payments, of money collected in the 
library from sale of catalogs, fines, etc. The treasurer’s receipt of the 
sum accounted for should be attached to the report. 
  1 Thirty-three out of 61 libraries report a three-year term; 7a two-year, 6 a four- 
year, 6 a five-year, 2 a six-year, 3 a seven-year, and 1 a life term.

THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 745 
BY-LAWS. 
Library boards are bodies corporate, hold the property and funds of 
the library in their own name, and have exclusive control of them. 
They make to the municipality an annual report, which must show the 
amount of money received from all sources and the purposes for which 
it has been expended, the number of books bought during the year, 
the number in the library, the extent of their use, and other facts of 
general interest tending to exhibit the proper discharge of the trust. 
These reports are published for public information. Trustees annually 
choose the usual list of officers from their own members. Standing 
committees are those on books, on administration, on reading room, on 
buildings and grounds, and on finance. Regular meetings are usually 
held once a month, but sometimes oftener and sometimes bimonthly. 
These meetings are open to the public, and the newspapers may publish 
proceedings of general interest. Accounts against the board are first 
passed on by the proper committee, who indorse their approval to the 
board, which orders a warrant on the treasurer in payment. 
The committee on books has general supervision of buying books, 
but the librarian must look after details. The committee outlines the 
policy of the library, fixes the sum to be spent, and considers special 
purchases, but is not supposed to give attention to ordinary current 
literature. 
The committee on administration recommends appointments, promo- 
tions, and discharges, and salaries of the library staff—presumably on 
consultation with the librarian—and final action on all these matters 
rests with the board. Civil-service rules are as important here as in 
any branch of the public service, if not more so. A system of compet- 
itive examination of applicants for library employment is prescribed in 
some libraries and is coming into vogue, to the manifest improvement 
in quality of library assistants. 
PUBLIC SCHOOL LIBRARIES. 
These are under control of the board of education. In some cases, 
usually in smaller towns, though originally established for the schools, 
they have become practically public libraries and are still managed by 
the board of education, which has a committee of three or five charged 
with their special oversight. The committee has no authority to take 
final action, but appointments of librarian and other employees and 
expenditures of money are made by the board itself. As the library 
grows and its management becomes more complicated, this method of 
government is found cumbersome and lacking in practical efficiency. 
In such cases the organization of a library commission with full powers 
of control is the usual practice.  
-P-A-G-E-756
  746 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
COLLEGE AND PROPRIETARY LIBRARIES. 
College libraries are controlled by the trustees of the college, gener- 
ally with a library committee in special charge. Proprietary libraries 
are managed by trustees selected by the proprietors. Special libraries, 
such as law and medical, are similar in their management to proprie- 
tary libraries. Trusts established by private benefaction are governed 
by the peculiar provisions in each, and no general rules are applicable. 
STATE LIBRARIES. 
In a few instances State libraries are managed by trustees; in most 
eases the governor appoints the librarian. There is a library committee 
in each house of the legislature which considers matters of proposed 
legislation relating to the library and specially with regard to appro- 
priations for it, but has no power or authority in intervals between 
sessions. The librarian is in control in all departments, appoints his 
own subordinates, makes his own purchases, subject only to the law 
governing each case. The criticism on the gubernatorial appointment 
system is that the tenure of office is too uncertain. Such appointments 
may be controlled to a greater or less extent by political considerations, 
and a governor seldom continues in office longer than two or three 
years. An inexperienced librarian and a new staff could not be 
expected to accomplish very much in a short term, and even if good 
work were done it might be quickly undone by a successor with differ- 
ent ideas. Where the method of governing by trustees, organized 
somewhat as are those of public libraries, has been tried it has been 
found to work satisfactorily. Other plans tried or suggested contem- 
plate the appointment of the librarian by the legislature or by the 
supreme court of the State. 
Whatever tends to remove the library in all its management and 
operations as far as possible from partisan politics is to its advantage. 
This is true of all classes of libraries, not alone of those owned by 
States. Instances are rare in which this disturbing element has shown 
itself in city libraries. The remedy in such cases lies in electing as 
trustees men entirely above petty considerations.! Entangling alli- 
ances with religious denominations are to be avoided no less than with 
political parties. Bigotry and intolerance may be shown quite as offen- 
sively in one as in the other. 
In another respect also care should be exercised in selecting men for 
library boards. It is not every “ good fellow” who would make a good 
trustee. Other qualifications being assumed, he should be a person of 
good sound sense, good temper, a capacity and a willingness to work. 
The trustee who gives no attention to the business of his board is

Tsay that it has, and7 say that it has to some extent. All agree that the bane of 
public library management is partisan politics.

CHIEF LIBRARIAN. 
It is not within the province of this article to name the qualifications 
necessary to a good librarian, but rather touching all points, to show 
the present condition of library service. 
Selection.—Success or failure of a library, as of a business, depends 
on the ability of the man or woman at its head. Only trained men and 
women should be in charge. 
The days of local feeling in the selection of librarian and assistants 
are fast passing away, and cities or towns that compel trustees to 
engage local talent, regardless of merit, are the exception rather than 
therule. In fact, to-day the demand for good librarians is beyond the 
supply. 
The librarian should be a gentleman, a scholar, and a good executive. 
“The true librarian,” as Mr. Crunden says, ‘“‘ keeps always in advance 
of his community and constantly educates it to make greater demands 
upon him.” 
Politics should not be permitted to affect the appointment of trus- 
tees, librarians, or assistants; and, except most State libraries and a 
few city libraries controlled by common councils, there is little to com- 
plain of on this score. 
Women.— Women have taken a high rank in the profession, not only 
as catalogers and assistants, but as chief librarians. Of the 508 indi- 
vidual members of the American Library Association 237 are women, 
and of this number 93 are at the head of libraries. 
Only 125 libraries represented in the American Library Association 
have men as chief librarians. 
Term of office.—This is usually during good behavior, though 52 
librarians report yearly elections. It is manifestly in the interests of 
the institution that no definite time be mentioned, as it leaves the incum-
-P-A-G-E-759
    
THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 749 
bent free to go on with his good work without interference—provided 
always that he retain the esteem and confidence of his superiors. 
Long term contracts are irksome alike to trustees and librarian. If a 
definite term is fixed pressure is brought to bear by those ready to take 
the place at its expiration. Good behavior and good work should form 
the only basis for continuance in office. 
Duties.—The librarian as the responsible head of the institution 
should be consulted in all matters relating to its management and effi- 
ciency and as to plans for new buildings. The most satisfactory results 
are obtained in those libraries where the chief librarian is permitted to 
appoint assistants, select books, buy supplies, make regulations, decide 
methods of cataloging, classifying, and lending, subject of course to 
the approval of the trustees. 
In 68 libraries such responsibility is placed virtually on the librarian; 
while only 16 report that the whole matter is in charge of committees, 
the librarian being merely their mouthpiece. To do this work calls for 
a man of parts. He must have a wide acquaintance with books and 
literature, and show good judgment in selecting his staff. In a word, 
he must be capable of managing the business as well as the literary 
side of the library. 
The question of making the librarian secretary of the board of trustees 
is perhaps a delicate one. Against the proposal it is urged: (1) That 
such duties entail additional labor on the librarian; (2) that trustees feel 
freer to discuss the librarian and his management when he is absent. 
In answer it may be said: 
1. That the additional labor is very slight, for in many libraries where 
the secretary is a trustee the records are written up by some one con- 
nected with the library. 
2. That whenever necessary to discuss the methods of the librarian 
and his staff, he could be requested to withdraw. 
All concede that the librarian should be present at board meetings 
for consultation and advice, and that no important action should be 
taken without first consulting him. The tendency certainly is toward 
making him secretary of the board. All libraries in New Jersey estab- 
lished under the law of 1884 are obliged to do this. 
The plan is a good one, for as secretary the librarian keeps the 
minutes, audits bills, and attends to everything pertaining to the office. 
He is thus brought into closer relations with the trustees, and it gives 
both an opportunity to study the library’s needs more carefully than 
in any other way. Such is the verdict of those who have tried both 
methods. 
Hours of service.—The average daily service appears to be about 
eight hours. This average is obtained by including a few librarians 
who report only five hours’ service and quite a number whose time 
extends to ten hours per day. 
 
-P-A-G-E-760
    750 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
No accountis taken of library work done outside office hours, Should 
this be considered, it would be found that every librarian having the 
interests of his institution at heart puts nearly all his waking hours ~ 
into the work. 
One of the most important duties is to attend the annual gathering 
of the American Library Association. Many a young librarian has 
here first imbibed that enthusiasm which has enabled him to battle 
with doubt and come out victor. 
Some 34 libraries regularly send representatives at the expense and 
on the time of the library; 12 libraries report that time but not money 
is allowed. 
It may truthfully be said that the money spent by a library in paying 
its librarian’s expenses for attending these conferences is an invest- 
ment giving the greatest possible interest. Its value can not be com- 
puted in dollars and cents. 
Vacation.—This is as welcome and as necessary to the librarian as 
to the school principal. Some librarians are obliged to take their vaca- 
tion at the time of the American Library Association meeting. This 
is not recommended. Anyone who has attended an American Library 
Association conference knows that means simply a repetition of library 
work wonderfully intensified. There is little or no rest for the enthusi- 
astic individual at these gatherings, because he is bound to get all new 
ideas and ail possible information from his brethren. The only satis- 
factory vacation is to drop all thought of the library and hie away 
to some quiet spot offering rest and change of scene. <A few days of 
such exemption from library cares and worry benefit alike trustees, 
public, staff, and librarian. 
To the librarian is usually given a little more time than to the as- 
sistants. In public libraries four weeks is a fair allowance; in college 
libraries vacations correspond with the regular college vacations— 
* about three months. ’ 
Where libraries are open Sundays and holidays the librarian is,not 
usually in attendance, but the assistant in charge receives double pay 
for such services. 
STAFF. 
Requisites.—At the Round Island American Library Association 
meeting in 1887 Mr. James Yates, of Leeds, England, laid great stress 
on the necessity of giving the chief librarian full control over his 
staff, illustrating his point by taking an ordinary workshop where 
“the employer is bound in his own interests to see that his employees 
are provided with true and good work tools, and that when they flinch 
they must be replaced.” 
Peter Cowell, chief librarian of the Liverpool public libraries, in his 
pamphlet on public library staffs, says: 
It isan absolute necessity that the staff should be characterized by ability, energy, 
and appreciation of their duties, for otherwise a lack of vitality would soon be appar-
-P-A-G-E-761
THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 751 
ent in the library, and a corresponding deficiency in its usefulness and popularity. 
When the staff of a library is imbued with a common spirit, and that spirit is iden- 
tified with the true aims and purposes of a public library, it follows that such a 
library will soon be engaged in a great and important educational work, and in 
exercising a wide and: beneficial influence. 
Harmony, then, as well as fitness, plays an important part in the 
success of alibrary. It is unfortunately true that where many women 
are gathered together—for pleasure or business—there you will find 
| cliques and jealousies. Particularly is this true in a library where 
wages are paid according to the duties performed. 
The catalogers and reference librarians are paid better than the 
delivery clerks and copyists. What might be called “class friend- 
ships” are formed, wherein those of a higher grade look down on 
those of a lower, and, as sometimes occurs, do not want to associate 
with or do the work of the other, If allowed to remain such a spirit 4 
breeds continual dissension. Pluck it out at once, even at the cost of 
hard feeling. When self is cast aside and all are working for the com- 
mon good the result is pleasing alike to the public, the trustees, and 
the staff. The members of-the staff should keep in touch with each 
other as well as with all departments of the library. Good feelings 
produce good results. Itis an excellent idea to bring the staff together 
(outside of library hours) to discuss library matters; and better still 
to meet socially on an occasional winter evening. Mr. Whitney says 
| “a library may be compared to a watch, each part in which depends 
| on the proper action of the other, and where poor work in the least 
member affects the whole.” Great care then is necessary in the selee- 
tion of the individual members. ; 
Appointment.—Of 229 libraries reporting, only 17 state that ap- 
pointments are made on the result of written examinations, but the 
consensus of opinion at the Chicago meeting decidedly favored such 
examinations. A preliminary examination serves two purposes: 
1. It enables the committee to ascertain the. acquirements of the 
candidate. 
2. It does away with all political influence. 
A candidate and his friends, finding that an examination is neces- 
sary before appointment will be made, hunt for some more congenial 
employment. It certainly eliminates undesirable aspirants and leaves 
trustees free from outside influence. 
Such examination need not be severe. Grammar, history, and liter- 
ature should be included, special attention being paid to writing and 
spelling. It does not follow that because one has obtained the required 
percentage he will make a good assistant; on the other hand, in my 
own library, for instance, it sometimes happens that an individual who 
| has barely passed proves the best adapted to the particular work re- 
quired. The written examination should be followed by ‘trial work” 
in the practical details of the library, after which a selection can be 
wisely made.

It is much easier to get a.person on than to get one off the staff. 
At the Buffalo conference, in 1883, the following’ resolutions were 
adopted: 
Resolved, That efficiency in library administration can best be obtained through 
the applications of the cardinal principles of an enlightened civil s»rvice, viz, the 
absolute exclusion of all political and personal influence; appointment for definitely 
ascertained fitness; promotion for merit, and retention during good behavior; and 
Resolved, That, in the opinion of this association, in large public libraries, enher 
dinate employees should, so far as possible, be selected by competitive examination, 
followed by a probationary term. 
When competent service can be secured for subordinate positions, 
preference should be given to local applicants. 
: As between local influence and competent service no bar should 
~ hindér the selection of the person best qualified for the’work. 
~ ~The establishment of the library school at Albangand of training 
classes' at-Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, and Drexel Ip itute, Philadel- 
phia, makes it possible to procure the best materiaf-at'a fair price. 
There is no longer excuse for securing incompetent vice 
-Titles—Beyond that of “first assistant” it is noe Sa’ fe to recom- 
mend titles for the various heads of departments. No“list that could 
be prepared would suit the different kinds of librarians or éyen the dif- 
ferent sections of the country; therefore, each library mo regulate 
the matter to suit local demands.’ 
Departments. —To a limited extent all libraries are divided into 
departments, but it does not: follow that each department has a sepa- 
rate head. 
In small libraries the force should learn work in all departments; 
and even in many large libraries it is better for members of the stafi 
to change work occasionally, i. e., the catalogers work certain hours 
in the day at cataloging ‘and then change to delivery work, ete. Six- 
teen libraries report that itis customary for the staff to leatn the work 
of only one department, except in cases of promotion. It is better 
-that assistants should understand all departments of the library, in 
order that satisfactory promotions may be made. 
It was the general opinion at the Chicago conference that better work 
would be accomplished by catalogers if a separate room were pro- 
vided. The library proper is no place for such a department, for the 
noise and confusion at the delivery desk distract the mind. For the 
best cataloging, quiet and seclusion are prime requisites. 
     
       
          
  
10ctober 1, 1893, at the Armour Institute, Chicago, a third class was opened, in 
charge, like both the others, of a graduate of the library school.—M. D. 
2Americans are beginning to use the better form, common in England, of ‘public 
librarian” instead of “librarian of the public library of,” and ‘‘of sublibrarian ,” 
“subcataloger,” ‘“ classifier,” ete., instead of the longer “assistant librarian,” ‘‘assis- 
tant cataloger.” ete. ‘Clerk in charge of the shelf-list department,” and similar 
infelicitous titles, are giving way to short descriptive titles like ‘“ shelf-lister,” 
“accession clerk,” “loan clerk,” ‘‘indexer,” ‘‘reference librarian.” Also ‘ page” is 
better than “messenger,” “director” than “‘superintendent.”—M. D.

Girls 14 to 16 years of age do better work as runners than boys, and 
are more easily managed. 
‘When possible the police department should be utilized in recover- 
ing books from persistent delinquents. Only a few of the larger 
libraries employ a special messenger-for this purpose. 
Daily service.—Returns show a reduction within a few years in the 
average library day from 8} to 74 hours. It would be interesting to 
know if the reduction has resulted in better work. With others I am 
inclined to believe so, but. the claim can not be proved. In two libra- 
ries, catalogers .jwork longer than employees in other departments. 
There seems to, be no good reason why this should be so; as a matter 
of fact, cataloging is not énly more trying and more worrisome, but i 
requires better mental caliber than does the delivery desk. 
By a vote of 4 to 1 the association decided that owing to the nature 
of their work catalogers ought to have shorter rather than longer 
hours, “° . 
Generally speaking, the smaller the library the-longer the hours of 
service.! 
Vacation.—A fair average for vacation is about three weeks, and to 
. this is added (by a very few libraries) an extra ten days during the 
winter—a boon appreciated by the favored ones. Some large libraries 
also allow absence notexceeding twenty days during the year for illness. 
Most boards’ of trustees howeyer, do not deduct from pay for ‘absence 
on account of ine:

The larger libraries haye gained experience which teaches that better results cam 
attained by adopting, not a mechanical system, but hours suitable to individual 
work. This average of seven and a half is found by including many libraries that - 
still exact unreasonable hours. It will doubtless grow still smaller as the lessons 
of experience are more carefully studied.—M. D,. 
2A theory justifying this payment for services not rendered is that, rather than 
haye lost time deducted, some employees will come to the library when their health 
and future best work require them to be at home or in bed. But, en the other hand, 
it is well known that, oftener, if as much salary will be drawn by staying at home, 
many will skip days when they might better be on duty. Absolute fairness requires 
that those who do not exhaust their allowance for illness during the year may adé& 
the time to the annual vacation, and this resolves itself into the direct businesslike. 
method of giving a liberal allowance, say six weeks (or half the teacher’s usuak 
vacation) for vacation and illness, and deducting for any absence for whatever 
cause beyond this. However much the librarian may sympathize with a deserving 
assistant in poor health, he has no right to dispense the taxpayers’ money in charity,, 
however worthily bestowed.—M. D.

  in ink the time of arrival and departure; and at the end of the year 
the book holds a truthful record of attendance. I say truthful, because 
I believe that if each member of the staff is placed on honor and 
allowed to make his own entry, rather than report to some superior, 
there will be no intentional errors.! 
Salaries.’-—“‘ The laborer is worthy of his hire.” The following reso- 
lution, adopted by the American Library Association at its meeting in 
Chicago, represents the ideal rather than the real condition of libra- 
rians and assistants: 
Resotved, That in tho opinion of the American Library Association the qualifica- 
tions and salaries of library assistants in important positions should be on a par 
with high school teachers; that applicants for positions in libraries should have at 
least a high school education; and that the heads of large librarics should haye sal- 
aries not less than those of public school superintendents in the same cities. 
Usually, salaries are much lower than those of teachers and school 
principals, and with no apparent reason for the difference, unless it be 
the successful efforts of some librarians to conceal their salary lists. 
In a table such as that appended to this report it is impossible to 
include a complete list of employees; therefore the amounts received 
by the librarian and first assistant only are given. 
The effect of such publicity ought to be beneficial to the profession, 
encouraging those on low salaries to ask their trustees for increase, 
and enabling trustees, without fear of criticism, to make such a fair 
increase as will place their institutions on a level with others in more 
favored localities. 
There need be no fear that a board, on finding that it is paying higher 
salaries than those in another city of corresponding size and wealth, 
will attempt to cut down salaries, for it is easier to have salaries 
increased than decreased. As each community has its own local con- 
ditions it is not possible to lay down a hard and fast rule for salaries. 
From 170 reports we find the average yearly salary $1,364 for chief 
librarians; $642 for first assistants, and $375 for general assistants. 
These averages are low, but the tendency is upward. 
Payment by the hour is resorted to by a few libraries, but the prac- 
tice is not recommended, as it has proved impossible to arrange a satis- 
factory schedule; though substitutes are engaged by the hour. 
For Sunday and holiday work it is customary to allow double pay. 
iThe best method of recording time, now coming into wideuse is by an attachment 
to a clock by which the exact minute of coming and going is recorded mechanically. 
It is much quicker and cheaper, but its great advantage is in eliminating all ques- 
tion of personal accuracy in the record made by an assistant or a recording clerk.

Los Angeles Public Library Training Class, 
REQUIRE 
  ENTS. 
The library, in its training class, does not profess to give general information, or 
to make up deficiencies in early education, and therefore requires of all candidates 
for admission to the class attainments equivalent at least to those of a completed 
high school course. ‘ 
Before submitting themselves for examination, candidates must have informed 
themselves of the contents both of the preface and appendix to the finding list, and 
of the rules and regulations of the library. 
Candidates will be examined in literature, history, current topics, and business 
forms. No promise of permanent employment in this library is held out to any can- 
didate; but all regular appointments to the library staff are made from the ranks of 
the library training class graduates. 
Applicants must be young women not under 17 years of age, and they must agree 
to give three hours’ daily service for a period of not less than six months, at the end 
of which time, upon passing an examination in a manner satisfactory to the board, 
they will be placed on the substitute list for paid employment as opportunity offers,

any applicant; neither are regular appointments to the library staff 
made except from the ranks of training-class graduates. The library 
staff is divided into nine classes, with salaries ranging from $10 to $50 
per month, and hours of service from four toeight hours perday. The 
number of attendants in the higher classes is limited, and to these no 
promotions are possible, except in case of vacancies. The regular staff 
is divided into three groups, the salaries of $10 to $25, first class; $25 
to $35, second class; and $35 to $50, third class. The certificated 
pupils are divided into corresponding groups, the percentages of each 
being graded as follows: 70 to 80 in the first class, 80 to 90 in the 
second class, and 90 to 100 in the third class, and from these the sub- 
stitutes are employed.

This plan has been in successful operation in the Los Angeles Public 
Library for three years, 60 applications for admission to the classes 
having been received, meantime, from this and Eastern cities. Of 37 
applicants who have served as apprentices, 19 have passed the exami- 
nations and 15 have been absorbed by the library in which they have 
received their training. Our library has found that its liberal condi- 
tions enable young women to take the training course who otherwise 
would have been debarred from the apprenticeship, yet who at the end 
of the six months’ service will develop unexpected and desirable library eae : 5 al i qualities. These persons the library encourages to continue their studies 
by offering them the slight remuneration of $10 per month, provided the 
second course is taken, at the conclusion of which it is estimated that 
the student will have acquired such executive or cataloging ability as 
will make her a valuable assistant in either capacity. In several cases 
young women who appeared specially bright and capable, apparently 
possessing that quick perception and tact so desirable in public library 
service, proved on trial utterly incapabie of performing that most trying 
of all the library duties, namely, desk service. To be able to cope suc- 
cessfully with a restless throng at the ero st desk, or to make cour- 
teous and appropriate suggestions or directions to readers is a faculty 
not learned in any school but that of experience. Such cases as above 
cited drop from the ranks of the apprentices in a perfectly sighed 
manner. That sifting process is constantly going on, so that those who 
remain have won confidence by proved efficiency. 
For small libraries specially hampered by a chronic necessity for 
retrenchment, the plan of a training class or apprentice system is ree- 
ommended as a direct saving of money. There is always ial local 
material within reach which, though undesirable in its inexperienced 
state, will nevertheless, trained and fitted for service, be a considerable 
factor in securing for the library the general esteem. As this is the 
library’s source of support, it is a double-edged stroke of policy to train 
local employees, thereby not only fastening its hold on its constituents 
but at the same time receiving an amount of service which, if paid for 
in coin, would add considerably to the annual salary account. 
SuNDAY OPENING oF LIBRARIES. 
By Mary SaLtome CUTLER, 
Vice-Director New York State Library School. 
This theme has the advantage of being unhackneyed, at least in 
the ordinary channels of library discussion, Except for a single casual 
mention at the Thousand Isiands, it first) came before the American 
Library Association in St. Louis, 1889. This report is simply a revision 
of that paper, bringing it up to date. The Government report, our 
text-book of library science, makes only incidental mention of it. The 
index to the Library Journal gives us 63 ieee to the subject, but

only 3 to an article covering more than a single page. It has but one 
mention in the 12 numbers of Library Notes. In 1877, while entertain- 
ing their American cousins, the British librarians had a little informal 
talk on this subject. In 1879 a Sunday opening motion was withdrawn 
by Mr. Axon in deference to the feelings of the opposition, and in the 
three following years similar motions were tabled without discussion. 
(See L. j. 2: 274-5; 4: 420; 5: 265-66; 6: 258; 7: 231.) However this 
may be accounted for, we would claim for it an important place among 
the practical problems that must be solved by the modern librarian in 
raising his library to the highest usefulness, 
The present discussion is limited to public libraries, though the statis- 
tics gathered include other classes. Much that will be said applies to 
libraries in general; moreover, the various kinds shade into each other, 
e. g., the proprietary often does the same work as the free public. The 
strongest advocates of the plan will try to convince us, with at least 
some show of reason, that even libraries for scholars should be run on 
the “town-pump” principle, and will point-~us to the fact that the Bos- 
ton Atheneum has been open on Sunday since 1807, and that Harvard 
College library, an acknowledged leader, has opened its doors from 
1 to 5 on Sunday since October 3, 1880, with a growing use from that 
day to this. They will also remind us that this action was approved 
by Phillips Brooks as chairman of the board of overseers. At the same 
time there is a clear distinction between libraries for scholars and 
libraries for the people; between working libraries (mental laboratories) 
and those designed for recreation and general culture. Arguments 
which obtain for opening the one do not hold good for the other. We 
therefore choose not to complicate the matter by a minor issue, but to 
ask ourselves in all seriousness the practical question, Should free 
libraries be open on Sunday? ( 
We are met at the outset by the statement that the plan proposed is 
a dangerous step because of its inevitable tendency to secularize the 
Sabbath. Itis looked on as the opening wedge which would lead grad- 
ually to breaking down the day of rest. From libraries and art galleries 
to museums is a single step, and by and by the lowering of public con- 
science will call for Sunday concerts, and a little later Sunday theater- 
going will be looked on with complacence. Meanwhile, if men must 
work that others may be amused, the passion for gain will soon demand 
increase of labor in other directions. They picture to us the French 
Sunday, a Sabbath only in name and in reality a seventh day of labor, 
and with this in mind we feel that those who have these matters in 
hand should think twice before running any risk of such a consum- 
mation. 
In Cardiff, Wales, where there is a free library and museum, an offer 
was made of a valuable gift of pictures, on condition that the picture 
gallery be kept open on Sunday. The reply of the committee (after 
refusing to call for the opinion of the taxpayers) expresses the senti-
-P-A-G-E-783
  THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. | ACS 
ment of that large class of earnest and conscientious citizens who 
oppose such movements: 
Resolved, That in the opinion of this committee, seeing the logical issue of open- 
ing museums on Sunday must involve an enormous increase in Sunday labor, and so 
lead to the virtual enslavement of workingmen and to the prejudice of national 
interests, it is undesirable to accept the offer of Colonel Hill on the condition named. 
This is the position taken by Bishop Potter in an admirable article 
(see New Princeton Review for 1886, 2: 37-47), one of the best presenta- 
tions of this side of the Sunday question.! It shows an entire absence 
of the Pharisaic spirit and a thoughtful consideration of the best inter- 
ests of the laboring class. He makes a strong point of the claim that 
the workingmen themselves do not desire Sunday opening. This feel- 
ing is expressed by a vote taken in England in 1882, where, he says, 62 
trades unions, representing 45,482 members, voted in favor of Sunday 
opening, while 2,412 societies and 501,705 members voted against such 
opening; and further by the opinion of such men as Broadhurst and 
Mundella, who were originally workingmen, and stand in the House of 
Commons as representatives of that class. Both these men opposed 
the motion before Parliament to open national museums and libraries 
on the day of rest, the stand taken by them largely influencing the vote 
(208 to 84) which defeated the measure. 
Summing up the objections, we would say that Sunday opening is 
opposed by many of our best citizens because— 
1. It compels additional Sunday labor. Z 
2. It tends surely to secularize the Sabbath. 
3. The workingman does not want it. : 
These various objections will appear to us weak or weighty, accord- 
ing to our idea of Sunday itself, and in fact this discussion involves 
the whole Sunday question. If, therefore, we would come to an honest 
and reasonable conclusion, we must not shrink from facing this much- 
vexed and perplexing aati of dispute. 
Are there not two well-defined and distinct conceptions of Sunday 
observance, and also two equally well-defined and distinct conceptions 
of libraries? 
Rest from bodily labor in the strictest sense, and a aay devoted to 
purely religious exercises, is the ideal Sunday of the Jew, the Puritan, 
and of a large body of Protestant Christians of our time. An investi- 
gation of our early State laws shows legislation on the subject very 
nearly uniform in its purpose, in its prohibitions and penalties. Ordi- 
nary work, business, travel, recreation, fishing, hunting, visiting, riding, 
driving eee walking in ate fields, learn selling liquor, and using 
tobacco were restricted; churchgoing was commanded, and punish- 
ments like fines, whipping, putting in the stocks, cutting off ears, and 
imprisonment were rigidly inflicted. During the early oo of Vir-

ginia, before the organization of the General Assembly, absence’ from 
church was visited with a night’s imprisonment and a week’s slavery; 
for the second offense, a month’s slavery, and for the third, a year and 
aday. (See Cooke, John Esten. Virginia, 1883, p. 112.) Passing by 
the severity of those early days and coming down to the New England 
Sunday two or three generations ago, we find the same idea in a milder 
and more attractive form. Perhaps some of us have spent a Sabbath 
in one of those old New England towns where the modern spirit of 
inquiry and doubt has not yet penetrated. An air of peace and calm 
pervades the place. The churchgoing and the hymnsinging and the 
quiet hours for thought were a perfect heaven to a deyout and aspiring 
soul. But this world is not made up of saints, and “the Sabbath was 
made for man.” 
Strangely enough, something in this notion of Sunday reminds one 
of the library of the olden time. A Sabbath stillness at all times per- 
vaded this temple of wisdom. The object of its existence was to inspire 
due reverence for itself. The priest of the temple was never so happy 
as in the summer vacation, when every book was in its proper place on 
the shelves and himself the only occupant. We must not, however, 
make the mistake of undervaluing the influence of the old-school 
library. It has preserved for us the treasures of antiquity, without 
which our modern scholarship would have been meager; it has opened 
its doors to the scholar and to the man of leisure; it has, moreover, 
encouraged in him independence of thought during the frequent inter- 
vals in which its gates were barred. Like the old-time Sabbath, its 
- work has been limited, because, like the Sabbath, it has existed for its 
own sake and not first of all for man. 
The other conception of Sunday has for its primary thought the good 
of man, and that not of the favored few, but of all. Like its predeces- 
sor, it involves physical rest and spiritual opportunity, but is not con- 
fined to these. It provides for the growth and development of the 
entire man—plhysical, mental, social, «esthetic, moral, and spiritual. 
With this view, no iron code of laws can be laid down for its observ- 
ance. Such acode would be subversive of its purpose; it must change 
as man changes, adapt itself to new surroundings, supply his fresh and 
varying needs, and, without arbitrary decree or provision of statute or 
exhortation from the pulpit, perpetuate itself and work out ifs glad and 
beneficent mission. I like Beecher’s characterization of Sunday as a 
“parlor day,” ftom which, of our own free will, we keep the common 
utensils of the kitchen, the barn, and the workshop. 
Frederick Denison Maurice, whose clear spiritual eye often sees a 
truth obscured to more earthly visions, tells us in his Life and Letters— 
It is certain that we and the Romanists have each taken half the idea of Sunday, 
and spoiled that half; they believing it to be a day of joy, and therefore working 
their bodies and giving way to bodily license upon it, and we supposing it to be 
spiritual, and therefore making it’sad. (See Life, Vol. I, p. 303.)

  Surely this need not be. We can not be content to settle down to 
the conviction expressed in these words ascribed to Horace Greeley: 
“You must choose between the Puritan Sabbath and the Parisian Sun- 
day; there is no middle-ground.” Already leaders of religious thought 
point to something better. The Bampton lecture for 1860, entitled 
“Sunday, its origin, history, and obligation,” breathes this broad and 
generous spirit; and the concluding chapter, “The Lord’s day viewed_ 
practically,” is well worth reading in this connection. The following is 
from an article in the Atlantic Monthly for 1881 (47: 537), called “The 
new Sunday:” 
The trend of the new Sunday is in the direction of a healthier and more persuasive 
Christianity, not wholly nor immediately what all could wish, but enough to give 
one hope of better things in store. The escape from the narrow requirements of an 
earlicr day may for the moment, even, be the taking of some steps backward. To 
see social and religious changes correctly one must not look at them from a local 
point of view alone. The present influence of Sunday is to broaden the Christian 
conception of the possibilities of ethical life and to uplift mankind on the physical, 
social, and intellectual, as truly as upon the moral and spiritual side. 
Such a Sabbath would be, as Emerson called it, “ the jubilee of the 
whole world.” (See Nature, addresses and lectures, p. 147.) 
We will let Mr. Dewey tell what is meant by the modern library idea: 
With the founding of New England it was recognized that the church alone could 
not do all that was necessary for the safety and uplifting of the people, so side hy 
side they built the mectinghouse and schoolhouse, Thoughtful men are to-day 
pointing ont that a great something is wanting, and that church and state together 
have not succeeded in doing all that was hoped or all that is necessary for the com- 
, mon safety and for the common good. The school starts the education in childhood; 
we have come to a point where in some way wo must carryit on. The simplest figure 
can not be bounded by Jess than three lines; no more can the triangle of great edu- 
cational work, now well begun, be complete without the church as a basis, the school 
as one side and the library as the other. (See Lib. Notes, 3: 339.) 
With this motive fresh in our minds, shall we not agree that the 
library aims to do for the community by the aid of books and personal 
contact what the Sabbath supplies by a wider circle of influences, both 
taking the mass of people as/they are and working to build them up 
in all that tends to noble life?/ If this be true, it is most natural and 
practical that they should use each other and work hand in hand 
toward the same end. 
To put it more definitely, there is a large class of people who will not 
go to church and who will not read the Bible who could be reached by 
the means of grace afforded by a library. There is, especially in cities, 
a multitude of men without homes to whom Sunday is rather a day of 
temptation than of rest. As the Christian Union expresses it— 
What can a Christian community do for this great class (on Sunday) better than 
to provide a kind of communistic substitute for home, in a room furnished with pic- 
tures and with books, warmed and lighted and made comfortable staying places?

    (76 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
The Rey. Plato Johnson, a pseudonymous writer in the New York 
Independent of February 23, 1882, gives us this idea in terse and 
expressive language: 
Dere ain’t no use in openin a libry fer de pore, wen noboddy can cum to it, an’ 
shettin it tite, wen ebberybody wants ter goin. Ef you opens dat libery on de Sun- 
day and invites all de pore to cum in and git a book so interestin dat dey wunt want 
ter go out an git a drink, de fuss pusson dat will make a row ’bout it an say ’taint 
rite, will be de ole gen’leman hisself wot lives below. 
  Nor does this imply giving people culture in place of religion. Bap- 
tists are not open to the charge of preaching the religion of culture, 
but one of their ministers makes an earnest appeal for Sunday opening. 
He says: 
Anything that helps the mind to better thoughts and keeps the eyes from vile and 
gross objects is not a hindrance but a help to the religious life, and will lead there if 
persisted in. 
Besides those who need to be enticed to a library on Sunday, there 
are many intelligent workingmen, who have already begun the work 
of self-improvement, who find Sunday the only time for reading or 
study; do not deny them a Sunday afternoon in a quiet place relieved 
from the distractions of the home. Perhaps you have no right to deny 
them on their only day of leisure that which they are taxed for as a 
common good. True, a certain number can utilize their evenings for 
this purpose, but a hard day of manual labor more often leaves a man 
quite unfitted for mental effort. We hear a great deal now about semi- 
nary work; it is the latest phase of the library movement. When will 
you do such work for the unprivileged classes except on Sunday, and 
what could be a more hopeful way of reaching the masses, the vexed 
problem of the church of to-day? Speaking of a similar work in the 
museums, Heber Newton says: 
How beautiful a ministry of brotherhood to be accepted, nay, even solicited, in 
the holy name of religion! Alas! that it is religion itself, thevery religion of Jesus 
of Nazareth, which, with an earnestness worthy of a more intelligent discipleship, is 
barring this step forward in the intellectual progress of hosts of our fellow-citizens. 
(See his sermon, “Superstition of the Sabbath,” Day Star, Feb. 4, 1886.) 
Tn the light of what has been said, we may perhaps return to the 
three objections against Sunday opening. 
We must admit the first; it does increase Sunday labor; though, as 
we shall show later, the increase is very small, probably less in propor- 
tion to the number served than is necessitated by church services. 
But our new view of the purpose of Sunday throws new light on this 
fact. The question to be asked is, Will the step proposed conduce to 
the real elevation of the community? Since, then, by the labor of a 
few the majority can be helped to the right and legitimate use of Sun- 
day, the first objection falls to the ground. 
The second argument, that it tends to secularize the Sabbath, is 
unanswerable. Such an objection is always unanswerable, Doubtless
-P-A-G-E-787
  THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. TT 
the first man in New England who asserted that he had a moral, and 
ought to have a legal right to take a quiet walk in the fields of a Sun- 
day afternoon had this same objection flung in his face. Unquestion- 
ably it does have that tendency, but what shall we do about it? We 
are not willing to go back to the Puritan Sabbath, we do not want the 
Parisian Sunday; for fear of the one, must we cling to such relies of 
the superstitions of the other as are left to us?) Must we not rather 
judge each case on its merits, ask each new innovation if it can bring 
us enough good to balance the risk, ask if its spiritis that of the ideal 
Sabbath forman? Judged by that standard, Sunday opening has come 
to stay. 
The third objection was that the workingman does not want Sunday 
opening. The Nineteenth Century for 1884 (15: 416-34) goes at length 
into this matter. It claims that the statistics referred to in Bishop 
Potter’s article are of no value, since they were worked up by “The 
Lord’s Day Rest Association,” which put the question, “Do you approve 
the amendment for opposing the increase of Sunday labor?” thus plac- 
ing a totally false issue before the workingmen; and against these is 
pitted another set of figures obtained by a vote taken previous to the 
other vote, in which there was a powerful majority in favor of Sunday 
opening. It is difficult for us to weigh the merits of these votes. 
Probably we would best disregard them both. We may notice, how- 
ever, that those who voted against Sunday opening appear to have 
done so, not because it seemed undesirable in itself, but from fear that 
it might lead to enforced Sunday labor, a point which we have tried to 
answer above. 
Should we wait the demand of the laboring man in providing means 
for his growth and uplifting? Surely it is more reasonable to expect. 
that those who, through no merit of their own, have been endowed 
with richer gifts and opportunities, should make it their constant 
study and find it their highest joy to anticipate his aspirations. 
Thus far we have been viewing this subject theoretically. From a 
more practical standpoint, what has been already done toward solving 
the problem? 
The appended statistics are a part of those collected by the library 
school as the A. L. A. committee for the World’s Columbian Exposi- 
tion, 1893. 
Though prepared with considerable care, great caution should be 
used in deducing conclusions. In spite of the proverbial veracity of 
figures, they do not always prove what they seem to do—e. g., N. 
is put down as a library not open on Sunday. It is a well-known and 
well-managed library, and the inference is that its example counts 
against opening. Butif we find later that it is a town made up almost 
entirely of beautiful homes, whose owners have libraries of their own, 
we put it down on a list of libraries not needing Sunday opening, and 
therefore not affecting the argument. In a few cases Sunday opening 
has been tried and failed, because introduced by outside pressure and

Jacking the librarian’s cooperation; sometimes a progressive minority 
have brought it about prematurely and very unwisely. A fair presen- 
tation of the exact status of Sunday opening in American libraries 
would involve a great outlay of time. The investigator should know 
each library, its work, and the spirit of its work, the town and the 
people who make up its constituency. Still, the figures and facts pre- 
sented, though unsatisfactory, indicate the trend of opinion, and at 
least serve as a basis for further study. 
For purposes of comparison the list has been divided into three 
classes: 
(1) Free libraries, including those supported by the city, like the 
Boston public, and also those maintained by private philanthropy, of 
which the Astor and the Providence Public are examples. Libraries 
partly free and partly subscription have been counted free. 
(2) Subscription libraries, both the mercantile and the atheneum 
types, and all variations of the two. 
(3) College libraries.

    Hours range mostly from 2 to Gor 9 p.m. Of the 69 reading rooms

So many have failed to state extra expense that the average has not 
been taken. Reference to the statistics will show that, so far as given, 
the cost compared to running is surprisingly small. 
The answers to the questions, Why is your library not open? What 
are your objections? are substantially three. Expense; no call for it; 
religious objections. 
It is significant that of the 69 libraries open, 55 call it a success. Of 
these 15 are not content with a simple affirmative, but express the fact 
in such words as perfectly, decidedly, entirely. 
As an indication of favorable sentiment, 7 cite a few sentences taken 
from printed reports and from private letters of librarians: 
[W: F: Poole.] 
I fully agree with the position you have taken in regard to Sunday opening. I 
have for twenty years been theoretically and practically in favor of Sunday opening. 
[S: 8. Green, L. J., 9: 85-86.] 
It is my opinion that it does no harm, but, on the contrary, much good, to have 
the reading rooms open on Sunday. Iam confident that the cause of good morals 
has been largely promoted by having them open on this day of the week.
-P-A-G-E-789
  THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 7719 
[J. N. Larned, L. J., 12: 230: 13: 135.) 
The results [of Sunday opening] have more than vindicated the wisdom of those 
who advocated this measure, and have removed, I think, whatever slight hesitancies 
there may have been in conservative minds. 
The opening of the reading room on Sunday has been continued through the year 
with increasing satisfactoriness. Generally speaking, the use of the rooms is only 
limited by the number of seats in them. 
[E. M. Coe, N. ¥. Free Circulating Library.] 
The report of the Sunday work seems to answer every objection which can be 
made to Sunday opening. 
(F: M. Crunden, St. Louis Public Library.] 
The Sunday opening here is an unquestionable success. 
(A. W. Whelpley, Cincinnati Public Library.) 
The Sunday library is a blessing in this community. It will only require « look 
through the establishment on Sunday to convince even an extreme fanatic that the 
good work done here supplements well the good work done from the pulpit. 
[Bridgeport Public Librarian, L. J., 10: 405.] . 
We consider the Sunday opening of the library as our most active missionary work. 
{Mellen Chamberlain, librarian Boston Public Library.] 
Sunday opening I regard as a success. 
[Melvil Dewey, director N. Y. State Library.] 
I began my study of this question with strong prejudice against it, but have been 
forced to believe in Sunday opening. In some cases it may not be wise, but nearly 
every experiment has proved a marked success, and its best friends are those who 
have tried it. y 
Not a few librarians, thoroughly convinced of the wisdom of Sunday 
opening, are held back from motives of expediency. Miss Hager, of 
Burlington, Vt., librarian of the Fletcher Free Library, told me at the 
last conference: 
We need Sunday opening; it would give us a chance to reach a class that I want 
the library to get hold of, but it would not be safe to suggest it; the people who 
support the library would be shocked beyond measure at such a proposal. It would 
only cripple our present work to attempt such an extreme measure. 
The case is further complicated by the question of cost. In the 
larger libraries this is of minor importance; but in little libraries, 
where every penny counts, and where it involves at least one extra 
assistant, the case is different. One thing is certain, if one librarian 
does all the work and devotes her entire energy to the library, it is 
quite out of the question to expect or even to allow her to do Sunday 
work. It has been suggested that voluntary assistance may solve this 
difficulty. It seems to me probable that in some towns a woman of 
eulture and leisure might be found glad to take this up as missionary 
work, and surely no one need desire a more satisfactory outlet for 
humanitarian zeal, but it is doubtful if this method could be depended 
on as a practical way out of the difficulty. 
     
-P-A-G-E-790
      780 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
These two obstacles, prejudice and lack of means, prevent Sunday 
opening in a large number of the smaller libraries, and it would no 
doubt be folly to attempt a forcing process. It must be brought about 
through gradual change of public sentiment, and may be hastened by 
anything that tends to broaden and liberalize that sentiment, and, 
when the time is ripe, by taking advantage of any propitious occasion 
for introducing it. 
I conclude that public libraries, for use of books in the building, 
ought to be open on Sunday. I can see no reason for circulating books 
on that day. The objections urged against such opening are of little 
weight, compared with the urgent claims of the unprivileged classes 
for such a work as the highest conception of Sunday and the ideal 
library spirit call on us to do. It has been in successful operation for 
years in many prominent American and in several English libraries. 
Just the people needing to be reached by Sunday opening respond to 
the opportunity and prove the demand by a constant and growing use 
of such privileges. It is approved by most of our leading librarians, 
and always gets a good word from the Library Journal. The obstacles 
of prejudice and limited means in the smaller libraries may be over- 
come by time. 
The conclusive word on this subject was, I think, said by Mr. Winsor 
at the L. A. U. K. in 1877 (see Z.j. 2: 274; L. A. U. K. proceedings, 
1877, p. 171): 
I think the hours that a library is open must correspond to the hours in which 
any considerable number of people will come to it, All night, if they will come all 
night; in the evening certainly, and on Sundays by all means. We have fought and 
are fighting the ‘‘Sunday question” as to libraries in America. People who ‘were 
once tortured with the idea now accept it. I appreciate the merits of conservatism; 
I do not believe in forcing, but I do believe in ripening. In any community the 
time for benefactions and philanthropy on Sunday will ripen in the end. 
I hope to continue the study of this subject, and will gratefully wel- 
come any bit of experience throwing new light on it, whether it con- 
firms or contradicts present conclusions. Address M. 8. Cutler, New 
York State Library, Albany, N. Y.

EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT. 
GENERAL SUPERVISION, INCLUDING BUILDING, FINANCES, ETC. 
By F. M. CRuNDEN, St. Louis Public Library. 
After providing for a treatise, “De omnibus rebus,” President Dewey 
has asked me to write a supplement, “De quibusdam aliis.” After dis- 
tributing the various departments of library management for special 
treatment, he has assigned to me the “Executive department,” which 
necessarily touches on all the special assignments, for there is no ques- 
tion in which the executive head of a library is not interested, none on 
which he ought not to have an influential, if not, indeed, a deciding, 
voice. The subheading ‘General supervision, including buildings, 
finances, ete.,” does little or nothing to restrict or'define, but rather 
confirms the interpretation I am compelled to give to my assignment. 
I begin with this preface in order to forestall possible criticism for 
trenching on the territory of other contributors. I shall try to deal with 
the special topics assigned to others in a tangential manner, avoiding 
the details that come within the scope of their papers. But it is mani- 
festly impossible to treat of the executive department as an abstraction. 
It must be dealt with concretely, with application to and exemplification 
from the various departments of library administration. 
Again, writers are instructed to “aim not so much to contribute new 
material as to present a judicial digest of previous articles, papers, 
discussions, and specially of experience.” Now, in the 17 volumes of 
the Library Journal, the United States Report on Libraries, Library - 
Chronicle, Library Notes, and other repositories of bibliothecal informa- 
tion there is more to be found on any one of its particular applications 
than on the general subject assigned to me; and on broad principles 
there is a fairly unanimous agreement among well-informed librarians. 
It is when we come to particulars that differences arise. Therefore I 
ean not well follow the instruction to divide this paper into two parts— 
the first stating what is generally accepted, the second the points that 
are still under discussion. I shall endeavor to cull from the literature 
of library economy the utterances of other librarians regarding the 
powers, duties, and responsibilities of the executive, and to illustrate 
and enforce these from my own experience, calling attention as I go 
along to questions still under debate and presenting my own views 
separately from the digest of other opinions. 
The whole subject may be summed up in Mr. Perkins’s receipt for! 
making town libraries successful: 
Businesslike management is the whole story. 
A public library for public use should be managed not only as a literary institu- 
tion, but also as a business concern. The business department of educational and 
literary institutions is too often overlooked or undervalued. Yet it is vain to expect 
1F, B. Perkins: ‘‘How to make town libraries successful.” (U.S. Rept. on Pub 
lie Libraries, p. 419). 
    3
-P-A-G-E-806
    796 _EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
the solid and permanent success of such institutions without good business manage- 
ment. Perhaps this truth may not be so fully recognized in the case of libraries as 
in that of other institutions for mental improvement; but those who are familiar 
with the inside history of great charities and missionary and educational enter- 
prises—Bible and tract societies, for instance—know very well that neither faith nor 
works (in the religious sense of the words) would keep them going very long without 
accurate bookkeeping, regular hours, and efficient business supervision. 
The success of any industrial enterprise depends on its executive 
head. A business man who doesn’t know an acid from an alkali or a 
can from a cogwheel will run a factory successfully, while a mechanic, 
who can construct and control the machinery, or who invented the 
details of the manufacturing processes, will soon become bankrupt. 
Of this the times give frequent proof. 
What, then, is “businesslike management?” It is that conduct of 
affairs that most thoroughly accomplishes the purpose of those engaged 
in business, viz, the making of money. ‘This final object is achieved 
through the intermediate aim of pleasing and serving the public, which 
is the final purpose of a library. How does the business man proceed? 
He first considers the wants of the community in which he intends to 
establish his business; he would not start the same kind of factory or 
store in Leadville or Deadwood as in New York City. 
He then selects a location. This must be adapted to the kind of 
business. If it is to depend for success on the general public (and such 
must be taken for my analogy), the store must be central and easy of 
access; and, of course, it will be handsomely fitted and supplied with 
the best fixtures for the display of goods and the latest appliances to 
facilitate work and render prompt service to patrons. 
He stocks his store with goods that people want, not those he thinks 
they ought to want; but having once established himself, it will be his 
pleasure, and he can make it his profit, to elevate the tastes of his 
customers and create a demand for higher grades of goods. It seems 
unnecessary to add that he will buy his goods in the cheapest market, 
always, however, giving preference to local dealers on even terms. 
This not so much on sentimental grounds as for valid business reasons. 
He must, of course, hire clerks and salesmen, increasing the number 
as his business enlarges. At first he will necessarily attend to every 
detail, and may have to do much routine work himself. He will, how- 
ever, do as little bookkeeping and office work as possible, and seek to 
know and be known by his customers. While they are few he may 
know and, at times, serve them all, making each feel that his wishes 
are a special concern, and that anything wanted will be obtained if not 
in stock. This will make the store very popular, and it will soon be so 
thronged with customers that the head of the house can do no more than 
see that they are waited on by polite and efficient clerks. He will find 
more and more of his time occupied with the larger affairs of the grow- 
ing business, and he will be compelled to leave more and more of the 
details to his assistants. By this time he will have trained someone
-P-A-G-E-807
  THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. vot 
who can act as his lieutenant to the satisfaction of the public and his 
other employees, but he will never be so occupied in devising schemes 
for the expansion of the business that he will not be entirely approach- 
able to customers and ready to assist all who wish to consult him as an 
expert, even though it may be regarding a trivial matter which a junior 
clerk is quite competent to attend to. He will organize his force, giv- 
ing to competent persons the supervision of departments, and himself 
supervising all. He will learn sooner or later that cheap labor is not 
profitable, and will pay adequate salaries to trained and trustworthy 
employees. It goes without saying that he will not hire incompetent 
people to oblige a friend or to help his political party. 
He will see that transactions in every department are accurately 
recorded and posted up to date, so that a statement can be had at any 
time on short notice. He will adopt the plan of keeping accounts that 
is at once, in his opinion, the simplest and surest, and that will give the 
greatest amount of information regarding goods and customers. He 
will, of course, have methods for ascertaining the wauts of his custom- 
ers, and will place before them and the public the latest articles in his 
line; and, as I have said before, he will endeavor to create a demand 
for the higher grades of goods. 
To complete the comparison, we must suppose that the business is to 
be established by a board of directors representing a large number of 
stockholders. We must further suppose that the directors are all so 
absorbed in their private affairs that they can give very little time to 
the business of the corporation. What would they do? They would 
first secure the services of an expert who was also a good executive and 
business manager; and this manager, being intrusted with full power, 
would proceed as I have indicated. It is unnecessary to carry the 
analogy further; and it could hardly be made exact on all points 
because of the different end in view. 
What then is the purpose of a public library? “To serve the pub- 
lic,”! i. e., to supply it with wholesome and instructive literature; or, as 
our motto puts it, “The best reading for the largest number at the least 
cost.” What are the means necessary to secure this desired end? 
First and foremost is the appointment of a good librarian, who should 
be chosen for executive rather than scholarly qualities.? This is essen- 
tial to obtaining the other elements of success, which are— 
1, A convenient location, accessible from all parts of the city. The

?The ideal executive head of a large public library should have the qualifications 
of both librarian and superintendent. (8:8. Green’s paper on ‘ Trustees and Libra- 
rians,” at Fabyan House Conference, L. J., 15: c. 24.) 
The same energy, industry, and tact, to say nothing of experience, which insure 
success in other vocations are quite as requisite in a librarian as book knowledge. 
Amere bookworm in charge of a public library is an incubus and a nuisance. (W: 
F: Poole, ‘Organization and Arrangement of Public Libraries.” U.S. Spec. Repts. 
on Public Libraries, p. 476.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-808
    798 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
general opinion is that it should not be on a thoroughfare; but this 
would hardly apply to libraries in the top stories of tall buildings. 
For a city of any size, branches or delivery stations are essential. 
Which should be chosen depends on cireumstances. (See G. W. Cole’s 
article on “Branches and deliveries,” p. 709. ) 
2. The building should be fireproof, commodious, and so arranged as 
to offer the greatest accommodations to the public at the least cost for 
administration. : 
3. The rooms should be kept clean and orderly, so as to be inviting 
to ladies and young girls, and to the most fastidious. : 
4. Such an air of courtesy and cordiality should pervade the place, 
accompanied by so little formality, that the most diffident laboring man 
will feel that he is weleome and that the resources of the library are at 
his command. 
5. The revenues of the institution should be so managed as to go as 
far as possible. 
(a) Books, periodicals, binding, furniture, and supplies of every kind 
should be bought on the most favorable terms. (Here the executive in 
a large library may easily save or waste a sum equal to his salary.) 
(b) The staff should be so organized as to give the greatest service 
at the least outlay. 
(ce) There should be an aceurate but simple system of accounts with 
proper checks on receipts and expenditures. 
6. Books should be selected judiciously, with reference to the client- 
age and aims of the library; readers should be encouraged to make 
known their wants, and these should be promptly supplied. It is gen- 
erally agreed that in a public library purchases should include the 
literature of entertainment as well as information. This is still to 
some degree a mooted question.’ It will, I think, be generally con- 
. ceded that a public library should supply the best new books in all 
lines, 
7. What seems the vest system of c:assification and shelf arrange- 
ment in-view of the peculiar conditions of the library should be 
adopted; and catalogs, card and printed, class lists, reference lists, 
and other aids and guides should be supplied according to the library’s 
means. The particular scope and purpose of the library and its finan- 
cial limitations being determined by the directors, the decision of all 
these details should rest largely with the executive. 
8. A charging system *should be chosen that is best adapted to, ‘the 
conditions. In a library of large circulation the system chosen should 
be that which combines highest speed with greatest accuracy while 
giving the most important statistics. 
(a) A minute when a crowd is waiting is more to be considered than 
pee minutes at another time; pherenre, choose a plan that involves

the shortest entries while the borrower is waiting, though these may 
afterwards have to be supplemented by additional records. 
(6) Don’t let your choice be influenced by the fact that a system 
furnishes statisties which you don’t want. Ordinarily one doesn’t care 
to pay extra for a watch that strikes the quarter hours. Next to 
aceuracy and speed, the chief desideratum is a minimum of require- 
ments from the borrower. There should be as little formality as is 
consistent with the greatest good of the greatest number. This should 
be the test and touehstone on all questions. 
9. The greatest freedom of access to shelves consistent with good 
order and safety to books. All will agree to this, though there may be 
wide difference in the interpretation of the qualifying phrase. The 
trend of opinion is undoubtedly in the direction of greater freedom 
even at risk of some loss and confusion. 
10. Every facility of obtaining information and every inducement to 
study. . 
11. Close connection should be formed with schools, public and pri- 
vate, and with study clubs and classes; and the library should, when 
practicable, take the initiative in establishing university extension 
courses and promoting other agencies for encouraging intelleetual 
activity. 
12. Finally, and to sum up, every effort should be made to keep the 
institution before the public, to enlist all elements in its support, to 
induce all classes to use it. Its facilities for furnishing informagjon 
should be so abundant that the student will come from far to seek its 
aid; its rooms should be so attractive and Aigenppty of books so ample 
that the rich can not do better than use it; — cordial welcome and 
freedom from oppressive forms should be such as to dispel the poor 
man’s doubt, distrust, and|mingled pride and diffidence, and make him 
feel that the library is his and his children’s and their heirs’ forever. 
To what degree these requirements are fulfilled must depend chiefly 
on the executive head of the institution. President Melvil Dewey 
(Library Notes, vol. 1. p. 45), after enumerating the various factors of 
suecessful administration, says: 
But the great element of success is the earnest moving spirit whieh supplies to 
the institution its life. This should be the librarian, though often # erson Who 
beats that name is little more than a clerk, and the real librarian. 
or committee. Such librarian will shape the other factors veryal 
There is, in short, as I stated in the beginning, na! 
so trivial as not to require attention from the execu

general policy beyond his proper consideration and infi zs 
erally devolves on the executive to be the motive power as Well as the 
guiding hand, the engine as well as the pilot. Certainly a syill_ agree 
that a good exeeutive will accomplish more with a poor building’ in a 
bad location and other drawbacks than an inefficient executive with all 
conditions in his favor.

    800 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
I quote this significant sentence from the last report of the trustees 
of the Los Angeles Public Library: “The management of the library, 
which has been intrusted entirely to the librarian, has given great sat- 
isfaction to the board and, we believe, also to the: public.” 
The foregoing views as to the importance of the executive exioay a 
general consensus of opinion on the subject. The powers and duties of 
the librarian as executive being correlated with those of trustees, to 
particularize further would encroach on the territory of another con- 
tributor. I give a summary of the replies of 37 librarians to the ques- 
tions: “Do the board and its committees always consult you before 
deciding on (a) questions of general policy; (b) methods of administra- 
tion?” Twenty-two reply “yes” to both questions; of the remainder the 
great majority answer “usually” or “nearly always” to both questions; 
while a few say “no” or “generally” to the first and “yes” to the 
second. 
The general tenor of the remarks on the questions is indicated by 
the following quotations: 
Can not imagine any sane board doing otherwise. 
Librarian should be given greatest possible latitude as to conduct of library in all 
its affairs. 
In my opinion no administration can be a success unless the librarian or chief 
officer is consulted in all matters pertaining to the management. 
Such an understanding would seem to be indispensable to a satisfactory adminis- 
tration of the library. 
Ishould be sorry to be the executive officer of any board which did not have con- 
fidence enough in me to ascertain my opinion before taking action. In a majority 
of cases the initiative is naturally taken by the librarian. 
Of the requirements of a successful administration above enumerated, 
a number are the special subjects of chapters in this manual; and some 
others call for no elaboration or argument. 
Buildings.—F'rom views heretofore expressed and generally con- 
eurred in, I cull these bits of advice to communities contemplating a 
public library building: 
Appoint your librarian before you do anything about a building, and 
having obtained a competent officer leave the planning and furnishing 
of the library largely to him. 
Don’t be in a hurry to build. As arule it is better to start in tem- 
porary quarters and let your building fund accumulate, while directors 
and librarian gain experience, and the needs of the library become 
more definite. It will also give the people the benefit of the library 
sooner. 
When you do build make a liberal allowance for growth. 
There should be provided in libraries that do not allow free access to 
shelves a Space near the issue counter where new books or collections 
of best books may be displayed and freely handled by visitors, a sort 
of “browsing corner.” In planning a library a cheerful spot should be 
set aside as a lunch room, with arrangements for boiling water.
-P-A-G-E-811
  THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 80t 
The supervision of the building, of course, devolves on the librarian 
as executive. He may properly depute this to an assistant; and in a 
large library there should be an intelligent and responsible head janitor 
to obviate the necessity of anything more than the most general over- 
sight. The head of the library should, however, test all supervision. 
Finances.—In this department there is, and may well be, a wido 
divergence in the organization of libraries. In a great majority the 
librarian is not burdened with financial responsibilities. Out of 37 
prominent libraries, 27 report that the finances and financial records 
-are in charge of some one who is not an employee of the library. In 
3 the books are kept by the librarian, in 6 by an assistant. This kind 
of bookkeeping is not profitable employment for a librarian. As a 
rule, he is a poor business man who has time to keep his own books. 
In 12 libraries the librarian acts as cashier, in 24 he does not. Four- 
teen libraries have definite appropriations, ranging from $20 to $500, 
to a contingent fund; 14 use desk receipts as a contingent fund; 9 
have no contingent fund. In 6 there is a limit to bills payable from 
the contingent fund; in 24 it is left to the librarian’s discretion; 7 do 
not pay any bills. 
A librarian should have a contingent fund. It seems to make little 
difference, however, whether the fund consists of the petty cash receipts 
or a special appropriation. I should favor the latter, and whether 
there is a limit for bills payable from this fund or not, the librarian 
should, as a majority report they do, use it sparingly and strictly for 
the purpose indicated by its name. Receipts or expenditures from this 
fund should, of course, be examined by the auditing committee. 
The finance department might well be made the subject of a separate 
paper. It is impracticable here to go into details, and it seems unnee- 
essary to dwell on the necessity of regular monthly audits and the 
indorsement of vouchers by the proper offivers. In the St. Louis Pub- 
lic Library each voucher bears three signatures, that of the chairman 
of the committee authorizing the expenditure, the chairman of the 
finance committee, and the librarian’s certification to the correctness 
of the bill. Each check is signed by president, treasurer, and librarian. 
Similar rules are, I believe, observed in most libraries. In the great 
majority there seems to be a reasonable check against dishonesty on 
the part of the librarian, though several librarians confess that too 
much confidence is placed in their probity. The ultimate safeguard is 
the librarian’s honesty; but for the protection of both trustees and 
librarian I venture to offer these suggestions: 
1. The librarian who has financial responsibility should be under 
bond. The best bond is that of a trust company, and the library 
should pay for it. 
2. The chief opportunity for dishonesty is in the duplication of book 
bills. This can be prevented, or, at least, made more difficult, by plac- 
ing the accession number opposite each entry in the invoice. Whether

‘the additional safeguard thus secured is worth the cost in time is for 
each board to determine. 
3. The time of the librarian is saved for more valuable work and 
an additional check is secured by having everything relating to the 
_accounts, including the making out of vouchers, done by assistants, 
the work being, of course, supervised by the librarian. 
Fises.’—This subject is well summed up by Mr. Utley as follows: 
The main thing is to sec that fines are impartially collected and faithfully reported. 
To this end tho matter is, so far as practicable, placed in the hands of one assistant. 
No system can be devised which will not, in the last analysis, depend on the honesty 
of the individual charged with its enforcement. At least, any system of perfect 
check is too cumbrous and costs more than it is worth. 
As Mr. Brett puts it, “the thing essential to the collection of fines 
without friction is absolute fairness.” 
My early experience gives strong confirmation of this. By observing 
the rule of impartiality (at the same time giving attention to the cor- 
rectness of returns) the receipts in the St. Louis Public Library were 
doubled in a short time, while the friction was reduced to about one- 
twentieth part. We now take in $1,000 a year with much less dissatis- 
faction than was formerly manifested over the collection of $300. 
The librarian should never cease striving to impress members with a 
sense of the impartiality of his administration in every respect; and 
he should never rest till he feels that every cent collected is honestly 
reported. | 
While looking after the revenues and the financial records, if they 
are intrusted to him, the librarian should keep a sharp eye on expend- 
itures and on waste. His judgment and business ability and watehful- 
ness may easily save his salary. In the largest libraries the difference 
between gocd and bad organization of the staff will amount to thousands 
of dollars; and with the meager funds that most libraries have, it is nee- 
essary for the librarian to see that every dollar is expended to the great- 
est advantage. He must first consider the direction in which money 
ean be spent with greatest benefit to the institution, and then expend 
it in accordance with business methods. It depends on his tact and 
judgment whether the library obtains articles above or below market 
rates. It is notorious that public institutions pay higher prices for 
goods than private buyers. Whenever possible, competitive bids should 
be secured from reputable houses; and more than ordinary care should 
be taken to see that contracts are fulfilled and no overcharge made. 
It is commonly assumed that bills to a public institution will not be as 
sharply scanned as they would be by a business house. When object- 
ing to an overcharge I have had the question put bluntly: ‘“¢ What 
difference does it make to you?” It is quite feasible for the librarian 
to utilize his acquaintance and influence among the best class of busi- 
10n collection and accounting for fines, see symposium in Library Journal, 16: 
103-105, 137-173. 3

ness houses to obtain special discounts for the library. Here he will 
find the aid of his trustees extremely valuable; and both trustees and 
librarian should avail themselves of expert advice, which can easily be 
obtained. They will find everyone ready to give counsel and assistance 
to an institution which, more than any other, serves the whole public. 
Selecting and buying books.—In most libraries the selection of 
books is left practically to the librarian,' and constitutes a very impor- 
tant duty. While it is primarily a literary function, it has a direct 
bearing on the management of the finances, for a dollar spent for one 
book is unavailable for another that may be more useful; and of two 
books equally desirable one may be bought for half the cost of the other. 
The following quotations represent the consensus of opinion among 
librarians as to where the power and responsibility of securing books 
should be lodged. In his inaugural address as president of the L. A. 
U. K., before referred to, Mr. J. Winter Jones says: 
The safest, and therefore the best, course is to be very careful in the choice of a 
librarian, and then leave the selection of books to him, subject, of course, to the 
control of the committee of management wherever the exercise of that control may 
be deemed advisable. 
In an article on ‘Selection and selectors of books” (L. j. 2: 152), 
James M, Anderson, assistant librarian, University of St. Andrews, 
sums up with these two conclusions: 
1. That books should be selected with strict reference to the province and’ needs 
of the library and to the character of its readers, and— 
2. That books should be selected by the librarian, or by a standing committee in 
conjunction with the librarian. 
His reasons for the second statement are that only the librarian can 
know the present contents of the library and the demands on it, and 
that committees change from year to year and the library would not 
grow symmetrically if the selection of books were left to them. 
In amplification of number 1—it is better to have 10 copies of a book 
that is in demand than 1 copy of that and 9 other books that no one 
wants. Dupligate the best books liberally. “Better 10 copies of 
Tennyson than 1 of Tennyson and 1 each of nine rhymesters.” 
The fundamental rule never to be lost sight of is, find out what books 
your patrons want and buy these first. 
In determining what books should be added to special departments 
valuable aid may be obtained from experts. 
Whether a library’s book fund is large or small, it is important that 
it be judiciously expended. Knowledge and watchfulness will make 
$4,000 go as far as $5,000 in less skillful hands. For fuller treatment 
of the subject by experts, I refer again to Dr. Poole’s article in the 
United States Report, and to Mr, C. A. Nelson’s “Selection and pur- 
chase of books” (Z. j. 12: 155), also to the symposium on the selecting 
‘So reported by 29 librarians out of 37.

  and buying books (LZ. j. 14: 336, 372). From these sources, chiefly from 
the first two, is condensed the following summary of directions, repre- 
senting a general, though not unanimous, consensus of opinion: 
1. Buy both dooks and periodicals from a local dealer unless there is 
a decided difference in prices. 
2. Don’t be tempted by a larger discount to give orders to irrespon- 
sible persons. 
3. Buy as much as possible from one house, so as to make your orders 
of consequence and thus secure better terms. 
4. Utilize competition. A library should secure from 25 to 35 per 
cent discount. : 
5. Keep informed. Examine secondhand lists and auction cata- 
logs and look out constantly for bargains. 
6. Do not buy ordinary subscription books or books on the instal- 
ment plan. : 
7. Don’t anticipate revenues, and don’t spend all your money at 
once. If you do you will miss many a bargain and have to go without 
books that are needed more than those you have bought. 
8. Buy good but not expensive editions. Avoid flimsy paper and 
fine or blurred print. 
Most large libraries buy chiefly through agents.!| This practice is 
almost universal for foreign books. 
Mr. J. Winter Jones says: 
The employment of agents for the purchase of books is not always the most eco- 
nomical mode of procedure, excepting in the case of purchases at auctions, or,in 
foreign countries where the transactions are large and extend over several countries. 
The division on the minor question whether it is better to buy books 
in cloth or paper covers is probably fairly represented by returns from 
37 libraries, 27 of which prefer cloth and 10 paper or sheets. The points 
in favor of cloth are that the books are ready for immediate use, and 
that a cloth binding marks the volume as a new book. The last argu- 
ment, of course, has no weight with libraries that cover their books; 
but in others it is well worth consideration. Myr. Greenwood? says: 
There is absolutely no economy in buying 2s. novels in sheets for 1s. 4d. and having 
them bound in leather for, say, 1s. 4d. extra, making the first cost of the books 2s. 8d. 
It is much cheaper in the end and more judicious to take the wear out of the original 
binding even though it be only paper boards, as there is always a risk of books being 
in demand, and the cost of binding them is thrown away, to say nothing of the dis- 
proportionate charge for binding thrown on the early years of the library. 
I would emphasize the “Don’t” regarding the purchase of subscrip- 
tion books from agents, especially in parts. Exception, of course, nay 
be made in favor of works like the Century and Murray’s dictionaries. 
There are few subscription books that can not be obtained through 
  10ut of 37 librarians reporting, 24, including all the larger institutions, 
employing agents. : 
*Thomas Greenwood, Public libraries, p. 379.
-P-A-G-E-815
  THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 805 
regular trade channels, and very few indeed that can not be bought far 
below the subscription price by waiting a little while. 
Bargains may be obtained from secondhand dealers; but as a rule 
they know the value of books and put prices but little below a good 
library discount. The best field for bargains is the auction room, where 
the secondhand dealers replenish their Soaks A good rule is not to 
buy any old books (unless immediately needed) except at a bargain. 
Remember always that any one of 100 or 1,000 or perhaps 10,000 books 
is needed by you as much as any other. Buy the one or the ten, that 
you can obtain at one-half to one-tenth price. 
Yet here a word of caution should be given to the zealous and con- 
scientious librarian. In his anxiety to make the most of his book fund 
he may save $10 in money at the expense of $20 worth of time. Judg- 
ment must decide what is true and what false economy. 
Books sent to newspapers for review may often be obtained at a very 
liberal discount. 
Libraries in the same city should avoid duplicating expensive works. 
Libraries with small means should not spend on a single costly work 
of interest to fev—and seldom used by them—a sum that would buy 
20, or perhaps 100, volumes that would be in constant and profitable use 
by many. 
All the judgment and care that can be given to the finances of a 
library with a view to securing as large a sum as possible for books can 
not prevent the proportionate increase of other expenditures. Insur- 
ance, for example, may be doubled or trebled in a few years; it costs 
more to keep a large building clean than a small one; and with the 
growth and expansion of the library and its work there is necessarily a 
constant increase in the salary roll. Therefore, the ratio of expenditure 
for books has no significance unless all the circumstances are known.) 
Economics,—Besides the larger savings that judgment and care 
may effect in the chief items of expenditure, there are numberless little 
economies which in the course of a year may reach a considerable 
aggregate. There is no economy in poor tools and appliances. In busi- 
ness it is often the latest machinery that makes the margin of profit; 
but rough notes may be made and figuring done on a scratch block or 
waste paper as well as on fine note paper. Even such intelligent and 
conscientious persons as librarians are sometimes wasteful. It is the 
executive’s duty to look after the pence as well as the pounds, remem- 
bering that every dollar saved means another book. Great corporations 
do not scorn the income from office waste baskets. Binding? offers an 
excellent field for exercise of judgment and oversight in the interest of 
economy. 
1Reports from about 30 libraries give 3} to 80 per cent for books. The last is from 
a library recently established. Omitting that, the average is a little above 25 per 
cent. ' 
2¥or technical points see D. V. R. Johnston’s article on binding. 
   
-P-A-G-E-816
    806 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. | 
In every detail it depends on the executive’s judgment whether 
money and time (which is money) shall be wasted on unnecessary things 
or things of minorimportance. The collating and covering of all books 
are illustrations. Both are unnecessary and wasteful. The latter is 
especially unwise as well as wasteful, and is, I am glad to say, adhered 
to by but few libraries. In many other details the decision must 
depend on circumstances, of which the librarian should be the best 
judge. Here, as elsewhere, the librarian should look sharply about him 
at all times and cultivate that sixth sense that is developed in the 
schoolmaster of seeing anything that is wrong. In a large library he 
ean not give constant supervision to all details; but he should learn 
the art of quick and effective sampling. 
Executive and staff—There is no more important function of the 
executive than that involved in his relation to his staff. It is, indeed, 
the very sum and center of the executive department, for all orders of 
the board, as well as all action lying within the librarian’s initiative, 
must be executed through assistants; and the effective organization 
and oversight of his staff is, therefore, the prime duty of the librarian 
as executive officer. But little has been heretofore published on the 
subject. The one point on which librarians are unanimous and on 
which all disinterested trustees must agree is that the choice of assist- 
ants should be left practically in the hands of the librarian, and that 
appointments and promotions should be on the basis of civil-service 
reform. As the resolution adopted at the Buffalo conference puts it: 
Efficiency in library administration can best be obtained through the application 
of the cardinal principles of an enlightened civil service, viz, the absolute exclusion 
of all political arid personal influence, appointment for definitely ascertained fitness, 
promotion for merit, and retention during good behavior. 
In 7 libraries out of 37 reporting, the appointment of assistants is 
left entirely to the librarian; in 8 they are practically appointed by 
- the librarian; in 18 the librarian suggests and the board appoints; in 
2 the board appoints without consulting the librarian. To this num- 
ber, I presume, may be added 2 that do not answer the question, and I do 
not wonder at unwillingness to confess so humiliating a fact. Appoint- 
ments should be left, not absolutely, but practically, to the librarian. 
The absolute power may be a burdensome and dangerous responsibility 
for a librarian even when backed by civil-service rules. - For what I 
regard as the best plan for securing efficient assistants I refer to Miss 
Kelso’s explanation of her apprentice system. 
Much of the success of a library, as of a business house, depends on 
the effective organization of the staff. But this, with the distribution 
of duties and the mooted questions of specialization versus all-round 
knowledge and training, and division of labor by kinds of work versus 
division by departments, and all other details come within the scope of 
Mr. Hill’s article (p. 747). In passing I recommend careful reading of 
Miss Edith Clarke’s article on “Departmental libraries” (Z. j. 16: 
264), which, I am inclined to think, will form the next stage in the
-P-A-G-E-817

evolution of library organization. Thus far the process has been divi- 
sion along lines of work, a process of analysis which may be succeeded 
by a new synthesis as set forth by Miss Clarke. 
I venture a few general observations from my own experience and 
thought. 
In a library, as in a school system, everything depends on effective 
supervision. Whatever plan of organization is adopted, it should pro- 
vide for thorough supervision through different grades up to the execu- 
tive head. This is one of the principal elements of success in “running 
a hotel,” which is, not unadvisedly, taken as the sign and synonym of 
executive ability. 
The librarian should allow his assistants to work in their own way 
unless he can show that it is a decidedly inferior way. Give general 
directions to a messenger and see whether he has ingenuity enough to 
work out the details; consult with the assistant who is to have immedi- 
ate charge of a piece of work, or let him devise a plan and submit it 
to you for approval or amendment. Everyone can work best in hisown 
way, and will take more interest in the execution of a plan he has 
originated or assisted in preparing. 
The librarian should take a personal interest in his assistants down 
to the youngest page. He should encourage them in self-improvement; 
he should fairly and favorably represent them to the trustees, securing, 
so far as possible, their due in hours, opportunities, and salaries. It 
also goes without saying that he should stand between his assistants 
and unfounded complaints or unreasonable criticism from the public. 
He should constantly consult with heads of departments and more or 
less frequently have general meetings for instruction and discussion. 
Librarian as secretary of the board.'—Service as its seeretary 
brings the librarian into closer relations with the governing bse 
I think strengthens his authority as executive. Returns from 37 libra- 
ries show 15 in which the librarian acts as seeretary and 22 in which he 
does not; 17 think the librarian should; 13 think not; 3 are doubtful, ~ 
and 4 give no answer. One librarian who is not secretary thinks such 
an arrangement “most desirable,” adding that the relations of boards 
and librarians are not sufficiently cordial and confidential. 
In a large library it is easy for the librarian to allow his whole time 
and energy to be absorbed by the details of his duties as executive to 
the neglect of the literary or librarian’s side of his work. He should 
strive against this. He should not whelly sink the librarian in the 
director. He should not permit his executive duties to deprive him 
of all opportunity to act as literary and educational adviser to the - 
public. He should spare some time and strength for reading and 
study for his own mental growth. This caution may be unnecessary. 
Up to recent years the great danger has been of the opposite extreme. 
The proper adjustment depends on circumstances and: calls for the

exercise of judgment. In the same library the ratio will vary at differ- 
ent periods. The business man who keeps his books himself is likely 
to lose thereby three times the salary of a bookkeeper. 
Colonel Higginson says: “‘The librarian should not have too much 
todo. If he does he can not look over the whole ground.” Having 
so organized his staff as to make his work chiefly that of supervision 
he will have time to attend to the larger interests of the library, includ- 
ing the comparative study of methods. In making choice of methods 
and machinery he must keep in view the end and aim of the library, 
which is always and everywhere to serve the public—its public. He 
should seek methods that have been tried and proved efficient under 
similar circumstances, remembering that ‘an ounce of Vineland is bet- 
ter than a pound of cosmography.” He should never lose sight of 
fundamental principles, which as President W. I. Fletcher said in his 
address at Lakewood (LZ. j. 14: 155), will be found “very largely along 
the lines of simplicity and tried effectiveness rather than along those 
of claborateness and theoretically exact arrangement of details.” He 
should be on his guard “against the twin irrationalities of an undue 
reverence for the ancient and an overweening ardor for novelties.” 
Mr. J. Winter Jones says: 
The points to be aimed at in both lending and reference libraries are rapidity and 
accuracy of service and record. To effect this everything * * * should be as 
simple as possible. 
It does not necessarily follow that a method or system which is adapted to one 
library is best for all. There are no qualities which will supplement even a little 
- technical knowledge so efficiently as good judgment and practical common sense.! 
These last six words form an excellent summary of what is required 
in the executive department. The scope and méaning of ‘common 
sense” as applied to library management is fully and admirably shown 
in the address of President C. A. Cutter at the St. Louis conference. 
I began marking passages for quotation, but found the markings so 
numerous that I must content nyself with an urgent recommendation 
of the address as a summary of sound doctrine. Like a certain cook- 
book that a housekeeper of forty years’ experience pronounces the best 
she has ever seen, it deals not with particular recipes but with the fun- 
damental principles that must underlie all library management. It is 
not novices alone that may profit by occasionally rereading it. 
This paper has had the public library in view; but general princi- 
ples are the same, and modifications will be obvious. The funds of 
the library may be so inadequate that a competent librarian can not 
be employed. The library must then depend on the volunteer work of 
trustees, one of whom, or a committee of whom, becomes the real 
executive. But to realize its highest possibilities a library should 
have a competent librarian as its executive head, and with the largest 
powers and responsibilities, able to say in his province, “ Aut Cesar 
aut nullus.”
-P-A-G-E-819

It should be the aim of the executive to make his library approxi- 
mate as nearly as possible to Mr. Ford’s test of the perfect library 
(ZL. j. 18: 179), where “a verbal $ ,’ is followed by an instant 
delivery of the book”; and, as the peer said in a former paper,! 
“Success will depend less on choice of methods than on vigor and 
thoroughness of execution.

  ACCESSION DEPARTMENT.

Librarian, Salem Public Library, Salem, Mass. 
[The writer has not thought it necessary to give the authority for each statement. 
The annexed bibliography gives fuller information.? ] 
Scope.—The accession department includes selection, buying, and 
accessioning of books—that is, the business side of the formation of the 
library. 
Who shall select books?—TFinal authority should rest with the 
full board of trustees, which generally acts through a book committee. 
This should be composed of the members most familiar with literature 
but of catholic tastes, so as not to run to hobbies. But as the average

committee can not give the proper time and thought to this work, the 
choice should be left practically to the librarian, who best knows the 
demands and needs of readers. The. committee should work in har- 
mony with him, check any tendency to whims, determine the general 
policy; and all purchases, unusual either in character or cost, should be 
referred to them. If promptness in adding new books is desired, the 
librarian should have authority to buy, within certain limits, between 
board meetings. 
In large libraries the best selection is secured by cooperation of per- 
sons in charge of special departments; in college libraries, by professors. 
Lists of books may often be submitted to specialists for eriticism and 
suggestion. 
Readers should be requested to suggest books, either in a book or on 
slips provided for the purpose, and such books should be bought so far 
as practicable. If one reader cares enough. for a book to ask for it, 
othersmay read it. By this method, the library is kept well-in touch 
with readers. 
Selection of books.—The Library of Congress, the British Museu, 
and the other great national libraries collect, rather than select, books. 
They aim to be complete in all departments. Special libraries, such as 
that of the Surgeon-General’s Office at Washington, endeavor to obtain 
every publication in their special line. 
Nearly all libraries, however, are limited in various ways, and are 
obliged to select carefully from the vast field of literature. 
The character of the library largely determines the character of pur- 
chases. <A college library buys a different class of books from a free 
public library, and an agricultural library differs in its needs from a 
theological seminary. College libraries and libraries of historical and 
scientific societies may be considered as special libraries (often, how- 
ever, having several specialties), and they must buy with this in view. 
What follows applies particularly to general libraries, both public 
and subscription, though much will also be useful to special libraries. 
Fiction buying is not considered, as this belongs to another paper. 
The principal factors in selecting books are the character of readers, 
the greatest good of the greatest number, and the amount of available 
funds. The smaller the funds the more difficult is the selection. 
The kind of readers should first be considered. A manufacturing 
town needs books on its special industries; a seaport, those on the 
ocean, ships, fisheries; a commercial city, those on commerce, banking, 
finance, political economy; a farming village, those on agriculture and 
domestic animals. A literary community requires a larger proportion 
of books on literary, historical, and art subjects. If the place contains 
readers of foreign languages, books should be bought for them, remem- 
bering, however, that in our country all should learn English. Pop- 
ular amusements should be catered to by buying books on hunting, 
fishing, the theater, baseball, card games, etc. It is also necessary to 
 
-P-A-G-E-821
  THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 811 
supplement the courses of instruction in the public schools and higher 
institutions of learning, not-forgetting public museums, picture gal- 
leries, etc. If there are literary or scientific clubs, books should be 
bought to meet their needs. Children should be encouraged to read 
good books by buying interesting, well written, and aceurate books of 
history, science, and literature, as well as good fiction. Local interest 
should be fostered by buying freely books on local history and science, 
and those by local authors. In short, the library should be the intel- 
lectual center of the place, ever striving to keep in advance of its read- 
ers, and, so far as it properly can, buying what the people demand. 
This principle leads to avoiding works not wanted, such as those in 
unused foreign languages. The librarian should keep track of coming 
events, and see that the library is provided with the books for which 
there is sure to be afuture demand. He should avoid personal hobbieg 
and be impartial on all controversial questions. 
Manifestly the proportion of subjects must vary greatly in different 
libraries. The following is the scale adopted for the A. L. A. model 
library of 5,000 volumes at Chicago, according to the Dewey classifica- 
tion: ;

In libraries of 10,000, 20,000, or 50,000 volumes, respectively, the 
proportions would differ. 
If means are small, expensive works should not be bought when 
there are good cheaper ones covering the same field. A library with 
an income of only $100 a year for books can not afford to spend $75 
upon the Century Dictionary; neither would it buy Nicolay and Hay’s 
Life ef Lincoln. The greatest good of the greatest number demands 
that the money be spent for an assortment of books of more moderate 
cost and upon a variety of subjects. This rule holds good for all 
libraries, for none are so situated that they can buy everything. It is 
doubtful if the taxpayers’ money should be expended on such Httle- 
used luxuries as first editions of Shakspere or of the Columbus letter. 
Popular circulating libraries should prefer good editions in one vol- 
ume to those in two or more volumes. Many readers neyer get beyond 
the first volume.

812 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
_ It is economy to buy good editions, not necessarily the most expen- 
sive, but those well edited, well printed on good paper, in good-sized 
type, are as desirable for public as for private libraries. The form of 
the book is an education in itself, and experience shows that good 
books, well bound, are better cared for than poor ones, even by the 
uneducated reader. 
Reference books and those on science and useful arts should always 
be in the latest editions. Earlier editions have their historical value, 
but should be left to the special libraries. Books on zoology, geology, 
and botany should be by American in preference to foreign authors, 
unless the subject is treated from a general standpoint or the author is 
a leader in thought. 
Itis often a question how far the moderate-sized public library should 
buy special books. In general it may be said, “‘Do not buy the tools for 
trades.” Draw the line between tle science of law and law as a trade. 
It must also be remembered that the professions are more independ- 
ent of the public library than the trades. Buy books for the mechanic 
rather than for the capitalist. The following specialties should gen- 
erally be avoided: School text-books, sectarian books, partisan politi- 
cal books, works in foreign and classical languages (this depends on 
local conditions, however), early English literature of only limited inter- 
est, technical treatises on law, medicine, and theology, genealogies 
(except of local families), and antiquated books, such as old histories, 
‘chemistries, etc. : 
Col. T. W. Higginson’s “Plan for the selection of books,” a report 
prepared for the trustees of the Cambridge public library, is a careful 
study of the principles which should guide a library in choosing books. 
In connection with this should be read Mr. Griswold’s criticism and 
Colonel Higginson’s reply. (Z. j. 15: 110-111.) 
Miss Coe’s paper, “Should American literature be specially favored 
in our libraries?” (Z. j. 15: 101-104) is a strong plea for a full represen- 
tation of American books. 
After the general policy of the library has been determined, what is 
the best method of compiling the purchase lists? 
Catalogs of other libraries of the same general character and of good 
standing are among the best guides, remembering, however, that every 
library accumulates more or less undesirable books through errors in 
purchases or indiscriminate acceptance of gifts. Also, that all catalogs 
soon become antiquated, as good books are continually being replaced 
by later and better ones. 
Several lists of best books have been published, the most prominent 
of which is Sonnenschein’s, though the extent of this list (50,000 vol- 
umes) makes it hardly a “select” list, and it is deficient in American 
books and editions. The “Catalog of the A. L. A. library at the 
World’s Columbian Exposition” will form a good basis for buying, as it 
is endorsed by leading American librarians. Special bibliographies are

always useful, particularly such as are annotated. For such bibliogra- 
phies consult the List of Bibliographical Works in the Reading Room 
of the British Museum, Handbook for Readers in the Boston Public 
Library, and Indexes to Recent Reference Lists issued by the Harvard 
College Library; also, Growoll’s Bookseller’s Library. 
These catalogs and bibliographies are only available in buying the 
books of the past. For current literature other sources must be con- 
sulted. The Publisher’s Weekly (N. Y.) contains the fullest lists of 
books published in the United States or imported in editions, and the 
notes are often useful, though not critical. Lists of English books may 
be found in the Bookseller (London). 
In many Sunday-school libraries all books are carefully read by the 
committee before buying, but for public libraries this is impracticable. 
Reviews in the leading periodicals, such as the Nation, Critic, Literary 
World, and Bookbuyer, supplemented for English books by the Athe- 
neum, Academy, and Saturday Review, are useful in making selec- 
tions. Special publications are best for many classes of books, such 
as Science and Nature for scientific publications; engineering periodi- 
eals for books on mechanical subjects; the Electrical Review and 
Electrical World for books on electricity, ete. But various reasons 
prevent placing full confidence in reviews. This has been pointed out 
by Mr. George Hes in his paper, ‘The evaluation of literature” (L. j. 
17: ¢ 18), and he proposes a system of cooperative reviewing, in which 
the reviews shall be impartial and written with due regard to public 
library needs. 
The difficulty of selecting fiction, mainly because novels are so often 
judged from the literary rather than the moral standpoint, has lead to 
several suggestions for publishing annotated lists of new books speci- 
ally for library use. Such lists were given in earlier volumes of the 
Library Journal, but were discontinued. The Massachusetts Library 
Club has recently considered the subject, but has been obliged to defer 
the plan for the present. 
Buying duplicates.—A question asked by the A. L. A. committee 
is, How much do you duplicate popular books? The answer can not be 
satisfactorily tabulated, but the following appears to be a fair state- 
ment of American practice. Reference libraries seldom duplicate 
unless divided into separate departments, in which case extra copies 
of certain books may be necessary. College libraries often require 
several copies of kooks used by classes. The subscription libraries, 
such as the New York Mercantile, buy freely of new books in demand 
(L. j. 14: 371). The best managed public libraries, if funds allow, buy 
many extra copies of the best books, but avoid much duplicating of 
ephemeral books. Demand for the latter soon dies out and leaves the 
extra copies unused. 
It is better to buy 10 extra copies of a wholesome book wanted by 
the public than one copy of 10 other books which will not be read.

Specialization —Lack of funds and the principle of adaptation to 
constituency has led librarians to consider specializing. While it is 
a great waste to duplicate expensive works or long sets in different 
libraries in the same city, it is yet a great convenience to students to 
’ find all the resources of a city on a given subject in- one library. An 
arrangement between different libraries by which each shall mark out 
its special field is very desirable. Every place should have one com- 
plete local collection. This should be in the public library, unless there 
is a historical society which covers thp same field. This specialization 
should not prevent each library having as many of the more popular 
books as it needs, as they must be brought close to the readers who 
will not go elsewhere for them. A list of the special collections in 
American libraries, prepared by Messrs. Lane and Bolton, has been pub- 
lished by Harvard University library (Bib. contrib. No. 45). 
Out of 181 answers to the A. L. A. committee’s question, 54 libraries 
reported no special collections; 49, local collections; 7, general American 
history, while the others each reported one or more special collections. 
Buying.— Buying should be in the hands of one person, preferably the 
librarian. Methods depend on the character of the books, whether new 
and standard works regularly in the market or those that are old and 
scarce. 
New books should generally be bought of one house, unless the library 
is a large buyer, when it may be better to divide the trade between sev- 
eral dealers, if they carry different lines in stock. If one bookseller 
has all the trade he will take special interest in seeing that the library 
gets what it wants, though the knowledge that the trade is divided 
sometimes acts as a spur to promptness in filling orders. 
A large part of the new English books are at once reprinted in the 
United States, or else are imported in editions by branch houses or 
agents. These can be bought on the same terms as American books. 
Other English books are generally imported by libraries on duty-free 
certificates at a saving of about 25 per cent. Instead of employing 
foreign agents, it is now generally considered better to order through 
the regular American agent, or else through a firm that makes a spe- 
‘cialty of importing. The cost, after adding consul’s fees, insurance, ete., 
is about the same, while the librarian is saved annoyance of custom- 
house entries, and it is in every way easier to deal with an American 
agent. 
Booksellers are generally glad to send new books on approval, but 
as freight both ways must be paid by the customer this is expensive to 
libraries at a distance. Because of the expense of carriage, also, small 
country libraries are obliged to buy less frequently. If practicable, the 
book committee should meet at least twice a month, unless the librarian 
has authority to buy between meetings. 
New books should be bought as soon as published, for two reasons: 
1. To keep the library up to date and satisfy reasonable expectations 
of readers; and
-P-A-G-E-825
  THE WORLD'S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 815 
2. Because many books are scon out of the market and ean only be 
procured at extra price, or with extra delay, specially if published 
abroad. 
English books can often be had cheaper a few months after publica- 
tion, either as “remainders” or from the great circulating libraries. 
The saving on the latter, however, is often more apparent than real, as 
they soon need rebinding. Many expensive English books are soon 
republished in cheaper editions. Only experience will guide when to 
buy at once and when to wait for cheaper editions or secondhand copies. 
It is seldom wise to attempt to deal directly with publishers, even if 
they make slightly better terms, as extra express on small parcels soon 
eats up extra discounts. Only part of the books bought being published 
by the larger houses, it will always be necessary to buy a large propor- 
tion of the retail bookseller, and it is not well to deprive him of the 
advantage of buying in large quantities and compel bim to supply only 
books on which there is small profit. He will be almost sure to recoup 
himself in some way. The same principle holds good with regard to 
the exceptionally large discounts offered by some dealers. These can 
only apply to what the trade calls “regular books,” and if extra dis- 
counts are made on these, extra prices are generally charged for the - 
“special books.” In buying books, as well as other merchandise, it is 
best to select such firms as have a reputation for honest dealing and 
pay them a price that will give a living profit. 
Of course a library distant from book centers must expect to pay local 
dealers somewhat higher prices, but so far as possible the local book- 
seller—under this term is not included those dealers who usurp the 
name of bookseller while their stock is mainly stationery, wall paper, 
and faney goods—should be encouraged, as the bookstore and the 
library help each other. A well-stocked bookstore, kept by an intel. 
ligent bookseller, is an intellectual gain to any community, and in a 
different way it does the same kind of work as the public library. It 
is a great pity that the present condition of the trade has driven out 
many of the more intelligent dealers. 
Certain books, including most so-called “ subseription books,” are 
seldom found in bookstores till some time after publication. While 
most “subscription books” are unworthy a place in the library, yet 
many desirable and indispensable works have been so published. Some 
librarians refuse to buy of traveling agents, but if a book is wanted 
immediately it is often best to get it through the channel chosen by its 
publisher. Publishers seem to have Jearned that it is for their advan- 
tage to employ a better class of canvassers, for the blusterer, determined 
to force his book on the buyer by any means, fair er foul, is mostly one 
of the past, or at least seldom enters the library. 
Many of the smaller libraries buy only new books, but the larger 
libraries, and those buying in special lines, need many books that are 
out of print, even if not scarce. These generally can not be bought as 
 
-P-A-G-E-826
    ee ee 
  816 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
wanted, but must be patiently sought. The principal sources are 
secondhand bookstores and auction rooms, personal search in second- 
hand stores being most effective. The books can then be examined, 
and the secondhand bookseller is generally as ready as the dealer in 
new books to send his goods on approval. Make the bookseller your 
confidant if wanting out-of-the-way books, specially if on a given subject. 
You may in some cases have to pay more, but you will secure books 
otherwise overlooked. The following extract from Mr. Growoll’s Book- 
seller’s Library is as true for book buyers as for booksellers: 
Then there is the well-read customer [or bookseller], who on occasions may be 
induced to give a hint or information concerning old or new books not easily got in 
any other way. * * * Take such men into your confidence; their assistance will 
often save you hours of study. 
Many secondhand dealers issue partial catalogs. These should be 
carefully examined for books that are on the “short” list or that may 
be wanted. It is hardly necessary to warn buyers to see that the 
books are perfect and of the best edition. Titles are often twisted in 
order to present them in the most attractive way. A leading New 
York secondhand bookseller used to say that the secret of cataloging 
is to enter the same book in half a dozen different places in the same 
eatalog in such a manner that the reader shall never discover it. 
The same caution holds in auction buying, and in no case should 
books be bought at auction except after personal inspection before 
sale. If the librarian can not be present, a secondhand bookseller will 
act as agent for a moderate commission. Whether buying in person or 
through an agent, a limit should be fixed for each item before the sale. 
Otherwise one may be carried away by his enthusiasm when the bid- 
ding is lively. If an honest, well-informed agent is employed much 
may be left to his discretion. 
. Searce books may often be secured by advertising in book trade and 
literary periodicals. Some libraries publish lists of wants with their 
annual reports, specially of volumes needed to complete sets of periodi- 
eals and transactions of societies. This often secures a gift of the 
missing parts. If making special collections, acquaintance with other 
collectors in the same line may often lead to advantageous exchanges 
of duplicates. 
Every librarian is recommended to study carefully Growoll’s Book- 
seller’s Library. Familiarity with its contents will enable the librarian 
to meet the bookseller on more equal terms to their mutual advantage. 
It would also be well for librarians to have some practical experience 
in retail bookstores and for booksellers to be informed as to library 
methods and systematic bibliography. 
The following facts were brought out by the inquiries made by the 
library school for the A. L. A. comparative exhibit. Of 155 libraries 
answering the question, ‘‘ What per cent do you buy at auction?” 106 
reply “none,” 27 “few,” 15 buy from 1 to 5 per cent, and 7 from 6 to 30 per
-P-A-G-E-827
  THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 817 
“cent. The question, “What per cent from secondhand catalogs?” was 
answered by 149; 57 say “none,” 37 “few,” 40 not over 10 per cent, and 
14 from 10 to 50 per cent; 1 says “large.” As might be expected, the 
smaller public libraries buy few or no books by either of these methods. 
On the other hand, the larger and more specialized libraries must secure 
much of their accessions either through auction or secondhand catalogs. 
Order system.— When purchases are small no special order system 
is required, except to keep a copy of orders sent and check off items 
when received so as to make sure that all orders are filled and none 
duplicated. The larger libraries, however, find it necessary to adopt 
some well-planned system of keeping track of orders. That of the 
Harvard University library may serve as a sample and is here 
described. 
The basis of this system is the order slip, which starts with the pro- 
fessor or other person recommending, and whose final destination is 
the official card catalog: 
Book number... 
         
    Ordered ..... 
Received .. Dit ses DOSE a ais Se ee ee

Remarks may be Sign your name ..-_....-. 
di the back of 
This tard: 2 - | ang the date: 3.2222 % 5. Su eae ere 
  ere is urgent need, write haste here. 
The following is the history of such a slip: When received it is 
dated and an assistant verifies and completes details of title, edition, 
publisher, etc., and sees if the book is already in the library or ordered. 
This assistant checks the slip, which then goes to the librarian for 
approval. If approved itis stamped; if not, the person recommending 
is notified, if he is a person entitled (except by courtesy) to hand in 
titles for buying. The slip then passes to an assistant who orders the 
book on a regular form containing printed instructions to the agent. 
The library has agents in London, Paris, Leipzig, Florence, Copenha- 
gen, Madrid, and several in this country. The slip is then stamped 
with date and name of agent, and the number of the order is written 
onit. A press copy of the order is then taken, after which it is signea 
by the librarian. A memorandum of estimated cost is then entered 
under the allotment from the book fund from which it is to be paid. 
As experience shows that a large proportion of the orders can not be 
immediately filled, it is generally safe to exceed by 25 per cent the 
appropriation for any given year. The order slip is then filed. 
When a shipment is unpacked the books are laid on a counter in 
order of invoice, which is checked. Order slips are then picked out 
by invoice, invoices being arranged by the agent according to order 
ED 93——52

  818 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
numbers. Date of reception is stamped on slip, also in copy book 
against the order. Theslip is placed in the book and the librarian 
looks over the books and assigns each to its book fund, which is written 
on the invoice against each item. The books are then collated and the 
' person recommending notified. If he wishes the book at once, a pink 
slip of paper is placed in the book and it is pushed through in a hurry, 
otherwise it takes the usual course. Name of library and date of recep- 
: tion are stamped on back of title-page and fund written below, book- 
plate, date slip for charging, and back label are pasted, and the book 
is entered on shelf list! and then goes to cataloger. The order slip is 
left in the book and as cards are written, it is corrected and fund and 
shelf mark are filled in. After cards are revised the order slip is filed 
in the official catalog. 
To keep track of books in the hands of the catalogers and prevent 
ordering books already received, a temporary slip for each book received. 
is written (much abbreviated) and kept in a box till books have gone to 
shelf and cards into catalogs. Each slip has a number stamped at the 
top and a smaller slip with the same number on it is placed in the book 
with the author’s last name or first word of title written on it. When 
book goes to shelf this slip is taken out. When a number of such slips 
have accumulated they are used to pick out the corresponding slips 
from the box. An inspection of the number shows how many books 
have been received for cataloging in any‘given time. 
During the checking of the invoice, reports on books not sent are 
indorsed on the order slip, also particulars as to partially filled orders, 
after which the slip is returned to the order drawer. A ‘continuation 
eatalog,” partly on cards and partly in a book, is used for keeping track 
of serials. 
In a small library all the processes of the above order system are not 
necessary, but it forms a good outline for adoption whenever the num- 
ber of orders is larger. 
Disposal of duplicates.—Nearly every library accumulates dupli- 
eates, mostly through gifts. While many of these have little apparent 
value, yet it must be remembered that every book has its proper place 
awaiting it. An old edition of a schoolbook is useless in the circulat- 
ing department of a public library, but may be indispensable to the 
American Autiquarian Society or the Essex Institute. The odd report 
of a society may be just what is needed by another library to complete 
its file. 
The question is how to bring a return to the library by placing these 
duplicates where they will do most good. Some libraries use the auc- 
1The Harvard College library is almost alone in keeping no regular accession book, 
though it does keep a book recording daily the volumes ayd pamphlets received from 
seach source. It enters on the shelf list instead of the accession book many of the 
particulars of imprint, source, cte. This routine could readily be adapted to the 
usual accession book. (See later under Accession book the reasons against omitting 
its use.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-829
  THE WORLD'S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 819 
tion room, but the attendant expense renders this undesirable unless 
for books of considerable value. The same holds true with regard to 
selling through a bookseller on commission. 
A central clearing house for duplicates has been suggested, but inex 
also the expense of handling must be considered. It is doubtful if 
there would be sufficient business to reduce the pro rata cost to con- 
tributing libraries to a moderate figure, and the State or National 
Government has hardly reached the point of undertaking this work at 
the expense of taxpayers.! Dr. Ames’s exchange of publie documents 
might be cited against this view, but in this case the work is confined 
to the publications of the National Government which are published for 
free distribution. 
For these reasons, libraries will generally have to depend, in the near 
future as in the past, on private arrangements, either for cash sales or 
for exchanges with other libraries or collectors. 
A few years since, the Columbia College library inaugurated a system 
of briefly cataloging duplicates on slips which were arranged by sub- 
jects. If another library desired books on a given subject, the slips for 
this subject were mailed. The order could be given by simply sepa- 
rating the slips of books desired. The list of special collections in 
American libraries will be useful in finding possible customers for 
many odd books, 
Gifts.— Diligent advertising and begging will generally secure many 
gifts, ranging from whole libraries to the refuse of the garret. Even 
the latter may contain long-desired books or missing periodicals. It is 
not necessary that all gifts be added to the library, and they should be 
received with the understanding that they may be sold or exchanged if 
duplicates or unsuitable. It costs money to catalog and store books, 
and those outside the library’s field should be rigidly excluded. Indi- 
viduals interested in particular subjects may often be induced to con- 
tribute either books or money to build up some special department. It 
is undesirable that gifts of miscellaneous books should be shelved by 
themselves. They should be distributed. through the library with their 
respective subjects. All gifts See be acknowledged at the time, as 
weil as in the annual report. 
Collation.—Librarians differ widely as to this. Some collate every- 
thing, others only the more expensive works and those containing 
plates, while still other experienced librarians collate nothing. The 
argument urged against collation is that it costs more than the occa- 
sional loss of an imperfect book. It is true that most publishers are 
1Since writing the above we learn that the New York Stato library will soon open 
its clearing house for duplicates. Books when received are appraised and the library 
is entitled to draw out an equal amount from the stock on hand at prices at which 
they were received. This is free for New York libraries only, and the cost-of han- 
dling is borne by the State because of the great practical value to all its libraries. 
It is proposed to allow libraries outside New York to share the advantages on pay- 
ment of the actual cost of the State’s service, no allowance being made for profit.
-P-A-G-E-830

willing to replace imperfect books years later if possible, but experi- 
ence shows that imperfections, even if noticed by the reader, are often 
not reported till after many years, when the book may be out of print. 
The safer rule is to collate all purchases, but a show of hands at the 
Chicago conference indicated the general opinion that it is desirable to 
collate only expensive works. 
Accession book.—The accession book is the business record of the 
library and is the first place where books should be entered. It should 
be accurately kept, so that it may be sworn to in court as a true state- 
ment of the contents of the library at any given time. The form of this 
book was one of the first subjects considered by the A. lL. A. coopera, 
tion committee, and their deliberations, resulted in the “A. L. A. stand- 
ard accession book,” now made by the Library Bureau. 
The facts given in this book are as follows: 
Date of accession. 
Accession number [consecutive]. 
Class number. 
Book number.

Author. 
Title. 
Place and publisher. 
Date. 
Pages. 
Size. 
Binding. 
Source. [Fund, and of whom bought, or giver.] 
Cost. 
Remarks. [Condition, rebinding, withdrawal.] ; These form the call number. 
An introduction contains rules for entering and a list of library abbre- 
viations. Each volume has a separate line and bears its own accession 
number. If it is worn out or lost it is marked “withdrawn,” which ends 
its history. The copy replacing is given a new number. 
Many libraries, considering the size of the “Standard” (35 by 30 em.) 
too cumbrous and costly, adopt the “Condensed accession book” (25 by 
20 em.), which contains the same items but allows less space for entry. 
In the Library Journal, v. 3 (see bibliography), will be found a discus- 
sion on the accession book, Mr. Winsor claiming that it is unnecessary 
and that the business entries might better be included in the shelf list. 
No other librarian came forward in support of his arguments, and it 
may be considered that the question has been definitely settled, and in 
_ favor of the A. L, A. standard.

The width of each column is given in centimeters. The size of the 
condensed accession book is well adapted for this. 
The principal use of the withdrawal book is to give a fuller record 
than can be made in the accession book of the circumstances attending 
the withdrawal of a book. When this book is kept the only entry in 
the accession book is the date of withdrawal. Another use is for sta- 
tistics. The year’s additions in each class can be ascertained from the 
accession book, the withdrawals from the withdrawal book, the differ-

ence is the net growth in each class. This appears to be the simplest 
and most accurate method of keeping these statistics. 
Marks of ownership.—As a mark of ownership the name of the 
library should always be stamped on title-pages and all maps and 
plates not containing letterpress. Also, as the title-page is often lost,. 
some other fixed page should be stamped. 
An embossing stamp is best for this purpose, as, if it is properly 
made, it is impossible to remove completely the impression. A rubber 
stamp is sometimes used, but this may offset if the book is closed before 
dry, and it may be easily erased by scratcher or emery paper. 
A bookplate should be pasted inside the front cover. Besides the 
name and address of the library, this should state the source from 
which the book was received, if a gift or bought from a special fund; 
also the shelf mark. Many libraries give date of receipt, but this is 
superfluous if the accession number is written or stamped in the book. 
The plate should not be too large, should be legible, with clear spaces 
in which to write the numbers, so that these may not be confused with 
the printing or engraving, and should always give the name of the 
State as well as of the city or town. 
For convenience, the pocket or date slip described under loan systems 
should be pasted in at the same time. 
‘We have now considered the various processes involved in adding a 
book to the library from its recommendation to its entry in the acces- 
sion book. Its future history, including its shelf location, cataloging, 
and use by readers, belong to other chapters.

PAMPHLETS. 
By Water 8. Biscox, Catalog Librarian, New York State Library. 
Definition.—Before treating of pamphlets we must know what they 
are. It is very common to set an arbitrary standard of a certain num- 
ber of pages and to call all unbound works below this standard pam- 
phlets. About half the librarians at the Chicago meeting limited the 
term pamphlets to unbound works of less than 100 pages. The Century 
Dictionary gives the following definition: 
A printed work consisting of a few sheets of paper stitched together, but not 
bound; now, in a restricted technical sense, 8 or more pages of printed matter (not 
exceeding 5 sheets) stitched or sewed, with or without a thin wrapper or cover. 
J. Winter Jones, librarian of the British Museum, in his inaugural 
address at the meeting of the London conference of 1877, said: 
A distinction ought to be drawn between a volume, a pamphlet, a single sheet, 
and a broadside; or rather one general agreement ought to be arrived at upon this 
branch of our subject. It may be urged, and with much reason, that every work 
which is bound should be treated as avolume. A work of an ephemeral nature may 
be called a pamphlet, but such a work may extend to more than 100 pages, When 
is such a work to be raised to the dignity of a volume? It is assumed that the ques- 
tion of pamphlet or no pamphlet will be confined to works in prose. It would be the 
safest course to apply the term single sheet to a sheet of paper folded once, or 
printed on both sides without being folded, and the term broadside to a sheet printed 
only on one side, 
Mr. Cutter has described them as “‘Those thin, limp books which we 
eall pamphlets.” 
The real distinction, on which all agree, seems to be that a pamphlet 
is unbound; whatever its size, as soon as placed in durable covers it 
ceases to be a pamphlet and becomes a volume. Whether any limit of 
size should be made among unbound works is an open question. Clear- 
ness and accuracy will be gained by disregarding size and making 
binding the sole test. We would not say seriously that a library 
should collect unbound works of over 100 pages and throw away those 
containing less pages. Neither can we satisfactorily base our treat- 
ment of these works on the shelves on the number of pages. It might 
be taken as one criterion in cataloging, but it would be only another 
way of saying “catalog what is worth cataloging,” and the rule would 
perhaps need to be broken almost as often as kept, for many pam- 
phlets of under 100 pages are more worthy of cataloging than most 
of those of over 100 pages. The question is really as to the collection 
and treatment of the large mass of unbound printed material which, 
not being regarded as valuable enough to bind separately, is kept 
unbound for years, perhaps always.

    THE WORLD'S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 827 
The following definitions seem to accord in the main with common 
usage: : 
Broadside.—A sheet of paper printed on one side only; e. g., hand- 
bills, Thanksgiving proclamations, ete. 
Sheet.—A sheet of paper folded only once, or printed on both sides 
without being folded and without covers. 
Pamphlet.—A printed work consisting of one or more sheets of paper 
fastened together, but not bound. 
Serial.—A- publication issued in successive parts, usually at regular 
intervals, and continued indefinitely. 
Sequent.—Any publication issued in parts, including ail serials, irreg- 
ular publications and books, the volumes or parts of which are issued 
at different times. In a more restricted sense, excluding serials, a pub- 
lication issued in parts, usually at irregular intervals and often with a 
definite termination. 
Statistics.—In reporting the size of a library or the number of addi- 
tions, volumes and pamphlets should be counted separately. This will 
give a fair basis for comparison of the size and value of different libra- 
ries. Itis here, perhaps, that there is the strongest argument for reckon- 
ing an unbound work of over 100 pages as a volume, not as a pamphlet. 
At first thought it seems better to say this report of 75,647 volumes 
means substantial works, whether bound or unbound; but this would 
not be true unless you excluded from the count all bound volumes of 
less than 100 pages, and I believe I have never heard a librarian pro- 
pose to do this. By using binding as the distinctive mark of a volume, 
the statistics say this library contains so many works which are bound 
and so many which the authorities think, taking all things into account, 
it is best to leave, at least for the present, unbound. From the count 
of pamphlets should be excluded all the numbers of current periodicals 
and proceedings of learned societies, and all parts of works issued in 
paper covers, but intended to be bound as soon as completed. This 
practically excludes all sequents except annual reports, catalogs, ete. 
These should be counted as pamphlets. There is also a wide diver- 
gence of opinion as to what statistical record should be made of bound 
volumes of pamphlets. Current report says that the British Museum 
counts as one volume 10 pamphlets bound together, while the Biblio- 
théque Nationale, at Paris, counts every pamphlet, bound or unbound, as 
a separate volume. If this is so, no just comparison of the size of these 
two great libraries can be made. In an accession book any number of 
pamphlets bound together are usually given a single accession number, 
It seems natural in statistics to follow the same rule, and to report the 
number of volumes the same as if they were counted as they stood on 
the shelves, without taking them down to examine their contents, and 
to report a similar count of pamphlets. If greater accuracy is desired, 
or if it is wished to show how large a pamphlet collection the library 
has made, it can be best dene by giving these facts as additional in- 
   
-P-A-G-E-838
    828 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
formation; e. g., 151,643 volumes (including 4,576 volumes, containing 
53,974 pamphlets) and 79,627 unbound pamphlets. Uniform usage in 
giving these statistics would be of great service to all persons engaged 
in the comparative study of libraries. 
Importance.—The desirability of preserving the larger part of pam- 
philet literature is granted by most librarians. Everyone will insist 
on the preservation of such as relate to the subjects in which he is inter- 
ested. Grant this, and all must be kept, for some one is interested in 
every subject. The importance of pamphlets is attested by the famous 
collections like the Thomason pamphlets in the British Museum, by 
the special catalogs of pamphlets issued by booksellers, by the sump- 
tuous binding frequently given to the once despised pamphlet, and by 
the extravagant prices for which they are often sold after a century’s 
existence. Special classes of publications sought for by enthusiastic 
collectors, such as early Americana, accounts of criminal trials, minor 
publications of noted authors, etc., bring large prices. It is true that 
the great mass of pamphlets can lay no such claim to a large money 
value, but are of seemingly ephemeral interest. Are they really of 
little importance? Reports of philanthropic work, of historical socie- 
ties, of governmental departments—national, State, and municipal—of 
religious bodies, propagandist pamphlets of all kinds, scientific mono- 
graphs, university theses, anniversary addresses—these and a host of 
others preserve information vainly sought elsewhere. They contain the 
material which will be wanted 100 years hence for writing the history 
of the movements of to-day. It is well to insist strongly on their pres- 
ervation somewhere, for there is more danger of their being despised 
than of their being overrated. It is the common everyday pamphlet 
which needs specially to be cared for, since that is the very one usually 
disregarded. The university extension syllabus, which is in everyone’s 
hand, the report of some local society or club, the manual of a church, 
or the report of a town officer—these are everywhere, and often no one 
thinks to lay aside a copy for preservation. 
Large depositories.— What libraries ought to make large collections 
of these pamphlets, to gather all the material they can and store it for 
the use of future generations? Certainly not every one, for, done in the 
least expensive way, it costs much money and labor and needs much 
space. The library must have a large income to pay the expenses, and 
alarge staff to.do the work. Then libraries should be scattered all 
about the country, for the double purpose of gathering more fully the 
pamphlet literature of each section of the country and to provide 
depositories which shall be easy of access to all investigators. There 
are not enough libraries at present doing this work. Perhaps all those 
whose means justify them in undertaking it are doing what they can; 
but if so, it is only one more reason for providing more ample funds for~ 
building up great libraries, to be both storehouses and literary work- 
‘shops. An analysis of the statistics collected for the comparative
-P-A-G-E-839
  
THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 829 
exhibit at Chicago shows only 42 libraries collecting annually over 500 
pamphlets, and only 12 which add over 2,000 per year. These figures 
are, of course, not complete, but with previous statistics they show that 
there are far too few libraries persistently collecting this ephemeral 
literature; the number does not seem to be over 20, and three-quarters 
of these are in the extreme East, i. e., New England and Middle States, 
including the District of Columbia. The great national library at 
Washington should, of course, stand at the head here, as in everything, 
collecting from both American and foreign sources. Then, in nearly 
every State there should be a large scholarly collection, aiming to col- 
lect the literature of that part of the country specially, but gathering 
in whatever it can get, receiving contributions from all the individual 
collectors and providing a place where everyone may be sure that his 
hobby will be gladly received and cared for; a place, too, where every- 
one will come with the expectation of finding material for his intellec- 
tual work, and where he will not be disappointed. 
Select collections.—What pamphlets should other libraries keep? 
Every library should have some specialty, and should have as good a 
collection on this subject as can be obtained. Many libraries will have 
more than one such subject. At least one library in every place should 
keep all local history and literature, trivial as well as important; local 
newspapers, sermons, addresses, and reports, school catalogs, catalogs 
of manufacturers or dealers, lists of church members or of any local 
society—whatever you would like to see if printed 50 or 100 years ago, 
collect now and keep for the people of 50 or 100 years to come. Hach 
college, school, and seminary should gather all that will preserve the 
history of the institution; yet often they have no complete sets of their 
own official publications, and the student periodicals and ephemera are 
very frequently passed by as too trivial. Theological seminaries will 
collect the literature of their denomination; societies—musical, artistic, 
literary, historical, or scientific—each have their special line plainly 
marked out. Accident often determines the field of collection. Some 
enthusiastic collector after gathering material for a lifetime bestows it 
on the local library; a local society engages in scholarly research or 
some line of investigation; a native of the town has become a noted 
author, and works by him and about him are carefully collected; per- 
haps he has been prominent in some event of national importance, and 
whatever relates to this event is sought for and added to the library. 
Other pamphlets, outside the specialties of the library, which it does 
not wish to preserve, are best sent to the nearest large library willing 
to care for them. 
Methods of collecting.—The same means, in great measure, will 
be used by the small and by the large library; differing circumstances 
*will make sometimes one and sometimes another method best. All 
libraries will use personal appeal as the most direct and efficacious 
method, which can be supplied by no other. It need not be direct and
-P-A-G-E-840
    . 
830 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
outspoken begging, though this is sometimes desirable, A personal 
statement of the purposes and needs of the library, what it is trying to 
do, and the literature it wishes to collect, made perhaps in ordinary 
conversation, will often produce far-reaching results. Requests for 
individual pamphlets, gentle hints that the library should not be for- 
gotten in the distribution of this or that treatise, and inquiries where 
the library can obtain a duplicate of a desired pamphlet, not only serve 
to get the individual object asked for, but show that the library is 
interested in that line and anxious to get all available material. 
Written requests will be used most by small libraries. Their efforts 
are not so extensive as to preclude writing; with small funds they can 
less easily bear the expense of printed forms, and usually the librarian 
has more leisure. Even in a large library the written request will some- 
times be needed, for it commands attention when a printed blank is dis- 
regarded. Correspondence with specialists, with requests for their own 
publications and for their assistance in gathering other material, should 
not be overlooked. You may thus hear of and often acquire many 
pamphlets which would otherwise be unknown to you. 
Printed begging blanks will be extensively used by the large library 
which is collecting widely. They must be used to diminish the labor 
and expense of correspondence. To offset the disadvantage of print 
they are fuller than a written request could be, yet they must not be 
too long or no one will read them. A brief outline of the purposes and 
facilities of the library and the reasons why such pamphlets are desired 
are sufficient. Special blanks for special subjects are very desirable, as 
in this way more minute information can be given and the exact pur- 
pose of the collection stated. 
Printed announcements should be placed in the publications of the 
library; and on the covers of catalogs, bulletins, and reports both gen- 
eral and special requests may be made. A list of the special collec- 
tions which the library has will often be of great service. A standing 
offer to send for or to pay express on packages of pamphlets, offers to 
exchange with other libraries or with private collectors, statements of 
the reasons why collections on certain subjects will be specially valua- 
ble to the constituency of the library, lists of pamphlets needed to 
complete certain files, announcements of gifts already received, these 
and many other methods serve to bring the matter to the attention of 
all who receive the publications of the library, and with no additional 
expense secure abundant returns. 
Printed catalogs.—When the library can afford it, wide distribution 
of special catalogs on each subject is of the greatest service. It gives 
the library a reputation among all interested in those subjects. It 
puts into visible form the results of the work already expended, and 
makes a much deeper impression than a mere statement of the plan or ~ 
of the numbers already accumulated. It shows gaps in the collection, 
and even without a plea for gifts vacaut places call aloud for missing

  THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 831 
  nuinbers, and many times pamphlets, of whose very existence you were 
unaware, are sent to you in answer to this unspoken plea. Sometimes 
it is desirable to make this catalog a complete bibliography of the 
subject, with call numbers against works already possessed, and a 
request for all others. 
Newspaper notices.—The local papers are usually glad to help make 
known what has been done and what is proposed. Sometimes a long 
account of the collection, enumerating varieties, describing the curiosi- 
_ties, mentioning the most important items for the investigator, and 
detailing the most needed desiderata, will be gladly printed. Often 
abrief note with requests for the help of all interested is best. At 
moderate intervals afterwards additional information might be given 
showing the progress made and reviving the subject in the public mind. 
acknowledgments.—W hatever other methods you have used, a thor- 
ough system of recording and acknowledging gifts, and a careful record 
of all sequents, and prompt requests for any missing number, is an 
essential to success. You must show that you appreciate what others 
do for you. A prompt acknowledgment of one favor is the very best 
request for a repetition. The supplies of the less prominent sequents 
is very soon exhausted, and it is necessary that any gaps in annual 
reports and more frequent publications should be noted speedily and 
requests for missing numbers sent. What can be obtained easily at 
the time for nothing it may be impossible to buy a year later. 
Make the material you have already accumulated so useful that your 
library will be recognized as a good place to send similar pamphlets, 
Exchange duplicate pamphlets with other libraries, especially those at 
a distance, from whom you may naturally expect to obtain the pam- 
phlets of their immediate locality. Sometimes an exchange can be made 
directly, by groups, without the cost of making a list, by offering 100 
or 500 pamphlets on your locality or specialty for a similar collection, 
e. g., I will send you 500 New York pamphlets in exchange for 500 Cali- 
fornia pamphlets.” Large libraries should, by special arrangements 
with smaller libraries about them, be the great depositories, and should 
lend from their large collections to their smaller associates, Thewealthy 
library should pay for arranging and caring for accumulations which 
the small library can not afford, and. the material would be equally 
available for both. At the cost of postage it could be sent at any time 
to the small library, and ordinarily it would be kept in the large col- 
lection at the center of population, where it would be most frequently 
needed. 
Preservation.—Most librarians agree that pamphlets should be 
finally bound into books, that there should be no permanent collection 
of pamphlets, which is only a halfway station on the road to completed 
volumes. If expense were no consideration a large proportion of pam- 
phlets would be bound separately. The cost of this is so great that 
only the wealthiest libraries can afford it and cheaper methods must 
be found.

  832 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
A few librarians advocate binding as fast as enough pamphlets are 
accumulated to make a volume, regardless of subject. They would 
depend entirely on the catalog to make the contents known. Any 
librarian who has a classified arrangement of his books soon rejects such 
aplan. He must have his pamphlets arranged like his books, and there 
are, indeed, stronger reasons for their minute classification. The ques- 
tion to be first decided is, shall they form a separate pamphlet collec- 
tion or shall they be shelved with the books? The latter plan seems, 
on the whole, best, though the former has some advantages. The sepa-. 
rate collection would usually be placed in a separate room, and would 
remove an element of unsightliness and disorder from the shelves; it 
would be more convenient for comparing new pamphlets with old, and 
for filing away recent acquisitions; it would allow the use of such special 
devices as pigeonholes, drawers (used by U. S. Naval Observatory), and 
various files and cases. This last is perhaps a doubtful advantage, for 
the devices are too costly for any except wealthy institutions. To shelve 
pamphlets on the regular shelves alongside the books seems most advan- 
tageous for the use of the library, both by readers and librarian, while 
it probably makes more work in administration. Resources on a single 
subject are brought more nearly together and the constant reference to 
two places is avoided. 
Pamphlets will then be classed minutely by subjects exactly the 
same as books and will be placed on the same shelves. Till they are 
bound they will usually stand together either at the end or the begin- 
ning of asubject. They may be kept in bundles, boxes, pamphlet cases, 
orin binders. Bundles are the cheapest, a package tied with twine 
involving practically no expense, but it is very unsightly, gathers much 
dust, and unless a considerable number of pamphlets are put together 
ean not stand alone, and is a vexation in taking out and putting back 
adjoining books. It may be improved by putting round it a cover of 
fairly stiff manila paper, and this may do for keeping incomplete vol- 
umes of periodicals while waiting to pick up missing numbers. The 
various binders, Emerson, Springback, Champion, Common Sense, etc., 
stand at the other extreme. They are neat, keep the pamphlets clean, 
and look like books; but they are expensive and in most cases will 
hold only a few pamphlets. The Common Sense, Emerson, and similar 
styles have the added objection of a permanent mutilation in the holes 
pierced through each pamphlet. For temporary storage on the shelves 
some form of pamphlet box or case seems most desirable. They can 
be had of any size and at reasonable prices. The sizes should fit the 
shelves of the library. The height of the ordinary octavo shelf is best 
for general use. This will contain all pamphlets up to nearly 25 em. 
high. The case should not be too wide, otherwise a few thin pamphlets 
left in it will slip down and become twisted out of shape. The medium 
cost L. B. wooden cases are of varying thickness (3, 6, and 10 cm.) to 
meet this difficulty. For very thin pamphlets in a subject where not
-P-A-G-E-843
  THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 833 
many are received the thin manila C. C. pamphlet case is usually satis-, 
factory. Manila cases may be obtained in quantity, made like the fold- 
ing boxes used by confectioners, very cheaply, an octavo case 5 cm. 
thick for $2 or $3100. Butthese are not strong enough to stand wear 
and soon become soiled and broken. Of more expensive cases the 
Clacher is perhaps best, a closed case excluding dust, with a table of 
contents inside the cover. 
When enough pamphlets on a single subject have been gathered for 
a suitable volume they should be bound, shelved, and treated like any 
other book. Annual reports should be bound at regular intervals, 
then reports by decades, 1880-89, 1890-99, etc.; thicker reports by half 
decades, 1880-84, 1885-89, etc. Unbound reports of each institution, 
society, or officer should be kept in a box immediately after the bound 
volumes. More valuable pamphlets should be bound separately. A 
form of binding is coming into use which seems likely to settle the dis- 
position of a great many pamphlets of medium size and value worth 
binding, but not worth an expenditure of 25 or 50 cents. A cheap 
cover is made with board sides and cloth back, having inside four muslin 
stubs on which four thin pamphlets can be pasted, or a muslin stub 
may be pasted on each side of thicker pamphlets. While this binding 
is not very substantial, it is strong enough for occasional use, inexpen- 
sive, and can be done quickly by cheap help without sending to a 
binder. The pamphlets can then be treated like regular books. Cer- 
tain classes of pamphlets should then be bound alone, or very closely 
classed, e. g., genealogies, if there is a large collection, so that each 
family may stand in its alphabetic place; individual biographies where 
there is only a single life, or two or three thin pamphlets which can 
go into such a binder as that just described; local histories, regimental 
histories; in short, all pamphlets where it is desirable for each to stand 
on the shelves arranged by its special character and in sequence with 
similar books and pamphlets, and to have it possible to place beside 
it another pamphlet on exactly the same subject issued years afterwards. 
Cataloging.—The ideal method is to catalog a pamphlet with the 
same accuracy and fullness as a book. A pamphlet is only a little book 
and often is worth more than many of the small, perhaps even of the 
large, volumes in the library. But if this little book is not important 
enough to bind, it is perhaps equally extravagant to spend time and 
money to catalog it. The sentiment at Chicago was strongly in favor of 
cataloging pamphlets. Yet if something must be left undone, this or. 
a part of it seems to be possible without too great loss. Pamphlets 
closely classed on the shelves are in a certain limited sense their own 
catalog. You can find there what the library has on a certain subject, 
and when readers are admitted to the shelves there is less objection to 
this plan. Certain libraries add a reminder in the card catalog in the 
form of a printed or written card under the proper subject head calling 
attention to the uncataloged pamphlets in such a volume or box. For

    824 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  the author catalog a separate catalog, not made as full or accurate as 
the regular catalog, may often serve a part of the purposes. It makes 
two places to consult and will often be overlooked, bat from the libra- 
rian’s side it may fulfill important uses and save in labor much more than 
its cost. Made on thin! slips by cheap assistants the cost of material 
and time is slight. New pamphlets ean be comparatively quickly com- 
pared with the catalog and duplicates thrown out when otherwise each 
pamphlet must be carefully classed, then taken to the shelves and the 
collection of pamphlets on the subject looked over before knowing that 
itis oris not a duplicate. Inlarge libraries the saving of time in going to 
remote shelves is an important consideration. In small libraries with 
few pamphlets it is probably best to catalog the same as books unless 
this hinders more important work. Often a loan desk assistant will 
have time, when ealls are less frequent, for this and similar less valu- 
able work. In all libraries of original research the value of pamphlets 
is inereasingly felt and the importance of a catalog is strongly insisted. 
on. It certainly should be done; but if pamphlets can be obtained and 
time to catalog them can not be found, then take the pamphlets and 
hope that the library will some time have money enough to do its work 
properly. It will be a stronger plea for more help to be able to say 
“the library already has material which ought to be made available” 
than to say “if more money is given to the library pamphlets can be 
gathered and much help given to readers from them.”

  CATALOGING. 
By Witiiam C. Lang, Librarian Boston Atheneum. 
There are several eodes of rules for cataloging. That most gener- 
ally followed is Charles A. Cutter’s Rules for a dictionary catalogue, 2d 
edition, Washington, 1889, published by the United States Bureau of 
Education as the second part of a special report on public libraries, 
originally issued in 1876. This work discusses the principles of cata- 
loging in a lucid and thorough manner and takes up a great variety of 
eases to which to apply them. It should be in the hands of every 
cataloger whether all the rules laid down are followed or not. It may 
be obtained by application to the Bureau of Eduction, Washington. 
Another elaborate work is Eclectic card catalog rules, based on Dziatz- 
ko’s “ Instruction” compared with the rules of the British Museum, Cutter, 
Dewey, Perkins, and other authorities. By K. A. Linderfelt. Boston, 
©. A. Cutter. 1890. This is an adaptation of a German code by the 
librarian of the Breslau library. It is in some respects fuller than 
Cutter’s rules and gives more examples, specially such as are drawn 
from foreign sources, but it treats only of author and title entries; sub- 
ject entries are not considered at all. The author has eompared all the 
cataloging systems with which he is acquainted and has noted their 
divergencies as well as their agreement on special points, so that his 
 
-P-A-G-E-846
    836 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93, 
work forms a compendium of the practices recommended by other 
authorities. It may be obtained of. Mr. C. A, Cutter, Forbes library, 
Northampton, Mass., or of the Library Bureau, Boston. 
Condensed rules for cataloging adopted by the American Library 
Association were printed in the Library journal, 3: 12-19, 1878, and 
may be found also in an appendix to Cutter’s rules. The Library 
school at Albany has also its own code of rules; it was published in 
1889, with many sample cards given, and‘may be obtained at the 
Library Bureau, Boston. It contains a Bibliography of catalog rules by 
M. 8S. Cutler, to which and to the introductory notes in Cutter and 
Linderfelt the reader is referred for further information. 
In the Library journal for September, 1893, p. 79, is a report by a 
committee of the Library Association on the subject of catalog head- 
ings which lays down certain principles that seem to be gaining gen- 
eral acceptance now, though departing somewhat from the stricter 
forms of a dictionary catalog. (See section 20, on p. 847.) The same 
committee will soon publish a list of subject headings which is likely 
to be of considerable use to inexperienced catalogers and to all who 
wish to keep their work in line with what is being done elsewhere. 
This paper does not undertake to discuss any of the principles of 
cataloging, a task already well done in the publications referred to 
above, or to décide any of the mooted points. It will attempt solely 
(1) to set forth briefly certain points in regard to a library catalog 
which may be now taken as settled, and (2) to mention certain other 
points upon which there is as yet no general consensus of opinion. In 
this second division the attempt is made to show what is the actual 
practice on each point of 58 leading libraries both large and small in 
different parts of the country. <A list of these is given at the close of 
the paper. The statistical material for this paper is derived from the 
191 answers to the circular sent out in 1893 by the committee on the 
A. L, A. exhibit at the World’s Columbian Exposition, and from the 
answers returned by the 58 libraries referred to above in reply to a 
more detailed circular of my own sent out in November, 1894, 
A. POINTS WHICH MAY BE CONSIDERED SETTLED, 
1 The necessity of a comprehensive and detailed card catalog. 
If a carefully made and reasonably full printed catalog exists the 
eard catalog may form simply a supplement to this, but if the printed 
catalog be only a finding-list or short-title catalog the card catalog 
_ should be complete in itself. 
Its forms are various: in drawers, in trays open on a counter, in slid- 
ing trays, in a Rudolph indexer, or slips mounted on the leaves of a 
book. In any case the point to be provided for is the possibility of 
inserting new titles indefinitely in strict alphabetic or other specified 
order.
-P-A-G-E-847
  THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 837 
2 On this catalog every work should have at least an author or (when 
this is impossible, as in the case of anonymous works, periodicals, ete.) 
a title entry. 
A common English custom is to use for certain ‘classes of works form 
or subject entry only; such are, almanacs, catalogs, society or academy 
publications, periodicals, ete. The nearly universal American usage is 
to treat these works like any others. 
3 In addition to author or title entry most works should also be entered 
under the name of the subject of which they treat. 
' Of the 191 libraries reporting in answer to the circular sent out for 
the A. L. A. exhibit, all but 21 had some kind of subject catalog. 
4 The author’s name should if possible be given in the vernacular, 
unless all his works have been published in some other language than 
that of his own nationality. Latin must often be considered the vernac- 
ular of medieval names. 
5 On author cards titles should be brief, and the author’s name and 
bibliographic details should be given in full. On subject cards the title 
should be fuller and descriptive, but the author’s name may be given 
with initials only, and some of the more technical or minute biblio. 
graphic details may be omitted. (See, however, for the actual practice 
of different libraries part 2, section 6 of this paper.) 
6 In transcribing titles the words and spelling of the title-page should 
be strictly adhered to, any addition or deviation being plainly indicated 
by brackets. Punctuation and capitalization need not follow the title- 
page, except in case of incunabula. 
7 Among the smaller points on which substantial unanimity exists 
may be mentioned: 
a Names with prefixes.—English and French surnames beginning with 
a prefix (except the French de and d’) under the prefix, all other cases 
under the word following. 
b Compound names.—In English under the last part, in foreign lan- 
guages under the first. 
¢ Oapitals.—No absolute uniformity, but the tendency is to diminish 
their use as far as possible. 
d Numerals.—In general, use the Arabic rather than the Roman forms. 
e Periodicals.—Huter under the first word (not an article), When 
published by a society refer from the name of the society; but if the 
periodical bears the name of Bulletin, Proceedings, Journal, etc., enter 
under the society as author. 
S Names beginning with Me or St.—Alphabet as if spelled out, Mac or 
Saint. The other practice is often followed in directories. 
g Reports of trials.—Crown and criminal cases under defendant; civil 
cases under plaintiff; marine cases under the ship.

B. POINTS ON WHICH OPINION IS DIVIDED. 
In regard to the various details of catalogs and cataloging mentioned 
below, the practice of each of 58 representative and well-known libra- 
ries is as far as possible noted. An asterisk [*] following the name of 
a library indicates that the present opinion of the librarian favors the 
particular practice named rather than some other which is in actual 
use. The abbreviations used are such as will naturally suggest the 
library for which it stands, but a list of them with the names of the 
libraries and librarians is given at the end of the paper. 
1 FORM OF THE CATALOG. 
A. A printed catalog, with printed supplements. Peab. has astempo- 
rary supplement on cards, but only as a preliminary for printing.. The 
linotype has recently been used in a few cases for printing library cata- 
logs and is likely to be often employed in the future. The Library 
journal (Aug., 1894) has an article on linotyping by Nathan Billstein of 
the Friedenwald Co., Baltimore, and a symposium by several librarians 
relating their experience. BPL is considering the practicability of 
accumulating material for a general printed catalog by means of the 
linotype and Fortes also has under consideration the plan of printing 
by linotype and issuing frequent printed linotype supplements. See 
the article in the Library journal for the results obtained by NewH. 
EnPr. Prin. and Pratt. See below under C. the names of libraries which 
have in use printed catalogs in addition to complete card catalogs.

2 THE KIND OF CATALOG. 
As stated above, nearly all libraries have or intend to have a subject 
as well as an author catalog. The different ways of carrying this out 
are many, but they all fall into two general classes. 
A. The author and subject catalogs distinct and separate. The 
author catalog necessarily contains some title-entries (anonymous 
works, periodicals, &c.,) and usually numerous title-references. 
The subject catalog may be— 
a In dictionary form. Amh, (title-entries included in the on 
catal.), Cin. Cong. (partly classed), Forbes (undecided), Mich. Mil. (the 
card catal.; the printed catal. on decimal classif.), Prin. (the card catal.; 
the printed catal. classified). 
b Classified on the decimal system (Dewey’s) Arm. (inclined to change 
to dict. form), BrY¥. (has also a dict. catal.), Buf. (for the public; diet. 
catal for staff), Mil. (printed catal.; dict. catal. on cards), NYFC. NYS. 
Ost. (printed catal.; dict. catal. on eards), Sal. (for finding-lists, Cutter’s 
classif. preferred), Well. 
e Classified on some other than the decimal system. Cal. HartTh. 
Prin. (printed subj. catal.; shelf-lists with added entries in red form 
another systematic classed catal.), StLM. (Cutter’s classif.; will be 
superseded by dict. catal. for public use), StLP. (Harris’s classif.). 
d An alphabetico-classed subject catalog, i. e. a catalog having 
general classes in alphabetic sequence, with alphabetic subdivisions. 
Harv. (biographic subject-entries now incl. in the author eatal.), NYM. 
Yale. 
B Author and subject entries combined in a single alphabet, the sub- 
ject entries being ordinarily under the word expressing most specific- 
ally the subject-matter instead of being grouped under general heads. 
Ast. BA. Bos. Bowd. BrL. (subject entries in part classed), BrY. (has 
also the decimal system), Brown, Buf. (incl. title entries, for use of staff; 
 
-P-A-G-E-850
    840 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
also separate author and title catal. of Fiction; decimal classed catal. 
for public), Cam, Chie. Clev. Col. Corn. Det. Drex. EnPr. Forbes (subj. cards 
will perhaps be placed in a separate alphabet), GrRap. HartP. How. 
Jers. LosA. Man. Min. NHay. NYFC. NYY. Newb. Newt. Ost. (printed 
catal. decimal), Peab. PhL. PhM. Pratt (Astral Br.), Prov. Sal. Ser. Spr. 
StLM.* StLP. (for juvenile lit.) Stan. Wat. Wore. 
© No subject catalog. MIT. Pratt (except for biog. and bibliog. sub- 
jects), Spr. (juvenile literature; the general catal. in dict. form). 
3 CATALOG CASES. 
Until recently the usual custom has been to keep the cards of the 
catalog in drawers, each drawer having ordinarily two rows of cards 
and intended to be used at its place. The objection to this plan is 
that a person consulting the cards in one drawer prevents others from 
using the drawers above or below, and that in order to have all the 
drawers at a fairly convenient height for consuitation the case has to 
be unduly extended. To obviate these difficulties a lighter drawer or 
sliding tray has lately been introduced holding a single row of cards 
and often not as deep as the old drawers. These trays can be readily 
taken from the case and. placed on a table or on sliding shelves set at a 
convenient height. The. libraries which have adopted such trays at 
least in part are BA. Bos, Bowd. Chic, Clev. Cong. Harv. (Divinity School) 
LosA. Mil. Min. NYS. StLP., while BrY. Brown, Harv. NYFC. Sal. and Scr. 
express their decided preference for this form of case. 
Ast. Buf. and Cam. use trays or boxes permanently exposed in a fixed 
position. 
4 CATALOG CARDS. 
A Size.—There are two recognized standard sizes in common use, the 
so-called postal size, 12.5x7.5 em. and the smaller size, 12.5x5 em, The 
larger size is used by Arm. BrL (subj. cds.) BrY, Cam. Chic. (new public

B Punching.—The hole in the card to allow the passage of a wire or 
rod is generally made in the middle of the lower margin, but BA. Buf. 
Harv. and Mich. put the hole in the lower left-hand corner, and Wore. 
prefers this position. The advantage claimed is that the lower lines 
are left unobstructed for writing. Some libraries have no hole punched 
in their cards and either hold them in by rods over the top or consider 
that no protection is necessary; such are Bos. Cal. Cin, Cong. HartTh, 
Mich. (larger cds), PhM, Wore. and Yale. 
©. Writing.—Most libraries still employ a running hand, generally 
preferring an upright and round letter toa slanted or angularone. A 
disjoined hand (i. e, one in which each letter is separate) is however 
used by Drex. GrRap. HartP. Jers. NYS. Prin. Ser. StLP. 
The typewriter is employed for cards by Bowd. BrL. Buf. Cam. Det. 
GrRap. HartTh. LosA. MIT. Mich. Mil. Min. NHav. Newb. Ost. Peab. Prin. 
Spr. StLP. and Star. All of these use the Hammond machine except 
the Newb. and StLP. which use the Remington. Of the 191 libraries 
addressed in the first circular 40 reported the Hammond machine in 
use and all but 8 found it satisfactory. Three libraries, Col. Harv. and 
StLM. stated that they found a typewriter distinctly unsatisfe ecory 
for cards. : 
Printed cards are now supplied by the Library Bureau at a moder- 
ate price for current new books, while some libraries print their own 
cards or mount printed slips on cards for their card catalog. Those 
reporting the use of printed cards are BA. (Library Bureau cards, also 
to some extent printed slips mounted), Bos. Bowd. (L. B. cards and 
mounted slips), Cin. (slips from Bulletins mounted), Clev. (since Oct. 
1894), Harv. Jers. (slips mounted), NYS, (L. B. cards), PhL. Prin. 
(intends eventually to use linotype altogether), Prov. (L. B. cards). 
5 CATALOG RULES. 
The best codes of rules are mentioned above. Few libraries follow 
any one code absolutely, but most take one or another (or, it may be 
two together) as a general guide, and change what details seem advis- 
able. It is this general use which is intended in the following state- 
ment: 
Cutter’s rules are adopted by Amh. Ast. BA. Bowd. BrL. Cal. Cam. Chie. 
Clev. Corn. Det. Drex, EnPr. Forbes, How. LosA. MIT. Man. Mich. Min, NHav. 
NYFC, NYM. NYY. Newt. PhL, Prov. Sal. Spr, StLM. Stan. Wat. Well. 
Wore. Yale, Outter and Linderfelt by Buf. Harv. Mil. Scr.; Cutter and 
Albany Library school by BrY. and HartP. Cutter and A. L. A. rules 
by Jers.; Cutter and Jewett by Bos. 
The A. L. A. Rules are followed by GrRap. Ost. PhM. and Pratt; the 
Albany Library School Rules by Arm. Col. (with many changes), and 
NYS.; and Linderfelt by HartTh, Cong. reports a specially adapted 
system.

6 RELATION OF SUBJECT TO AUTHOR CARDs. 
  The general principle which should govern the relative fullness of 
author and subject cards in bibliographic and descriptive particulars 
would seem to be that on the author catalog, its primary object being 
to determine whether a given book is owned, it is essential to distin- 
guish accurately (1) between different authors with similar or identical 
names, (2) between different books by the same author, and (3) between 
different editions of the same book, while on the subject catalog, which 
is intended to bring together books on the same subject, the essential 
point is to display the differences in character and scope between these 
books. It would fellow that whatever degree of accuracy in regard to 
authors’ names is aimed at or whatever bibliographic detail is expressed 
should be given first of all on the author cards and is of secondary 
importance on the subject cards, and that any fullness of description 
in the title further than what is needed to distinguish between two 
works by the same author or to make a title recognizable by the 
inquirer belongs first of all on the subject card and is of secondary 
importance on the author card. In actual practice however there is a 
great variety in the methods followed, the result no doubt partly of the 
fact that the author catalog has generally been considered the more 
important record and was for long the only record, and that the subject 
catalog is a later development and was at first little more than an index 
to the other. Certain practical considerations such as the printing of 
cards, and the copying of one kind from the other instead of directly from 
the title-page also influence the application of the principles stated. 
The practices of the various libraries as nearly as they can be stated 
in regard to the bibliographic and descriptive particulars of the subject 
eards (not including the fullness of the author’s name) fall into eight 
classes. 
1. Descriptive part of the title less full, bibliographic particulars less 
full, Amh. Ast. Bowd. Clev. Cong. EnPr. HartTh. How. Mil. Newb. Newt. 
Peab. PhL. PhM. Prov. Scr. Stan. 
2. Descr. less full, bibl. same, Chic. GrRap. Jers. NYFC. 
3. Deser. less full, bibl. fuller, Min. 
4, Deser. same, bibl. less full, BrL, Col. Corn. Det. Mich. Newt.* 
5. Deser. same, bibl. same (i. e. both cards alike). Bos, Brown. Cin. 
Drex. HartP. Harv. Man. NHav. NYM. NYY. Ost. Pratt. Prin. Sal. Spr. 
StLM. StLP. Wore. Yale. Of the above, it may be noted, Bos. Cin, Harv. 
and Prin. employ print in some form. 
6. Deser. fuller, bibl. less full, Forbes. Harv.* LosA. StLM.* Wat. 
7. Deser. fuller, bibl. same, Arm. BA, BrY. Cam. NYS. 
8. Deser. fuller, bibl. fuller, Buf. (gives no bibliog. particulars and 
only a brief title on author eds.), Cal. Prov.* Well.

actual use.

7, AUTHOR’S NAME IN HEADING. 
The general feeling has been that an author’s name in order to dis- 
tinguish him from others of similar name must be given in as complete 
a form as possible, and that therefore even names which he has seldom 
er never himself used should be given if they have once been his by 
baptism. This, ifcarried out means much time spent in investigation, for 
itis frequently found that dictionaries differ in regard to these unused 
names or their proper order and that authorities must be compared 
and weighed in order to arrive ata result. The opinion has been gain- 
ing ground in recent years that this has been carried too far, while some 
librarians have even maintained that the object should be to give the 
author’s name as nearly as possible in the form which he customarily 
uses himself excepting only that initials Should be filled out if possible. 
It is especially difficult to classify libraries on the basis of their usage 
in this respect or to represent fairly in any brief forin their practice. I 
have divided them roughly below judging as best I could from their 
answers to my question. 
a The name generally given, in as full a form as can be found, but 
with many exceptions as noted, Arm. (usually). Ast. Bos. (with excep- 
tions), BrL, Brown. Cal. (try to use all initials or Cutter’s abbreviations), 
Cam. (except French and German), Chic. Cin. Clev. (sometimes omit names 
not used), Cong. Corn. Det. Drex. (unless author is decidedly better known 
under shorter form), EnPr. GrRap. HartP. HartTh. Irs, (put on all initials 
but donot amplify, inserting usual form in parenthesis, and making refer- 
ence from it when alph. sequence is different), LosA. Mich. Mil. (for 
printed catalog), NHav. NYFC. NYS. NYY. Newb. (in German and 
French use the well known name and refer from the full name), Newt. 
(of doubtful value), Ost. (of doubtful value), Peab. PhH. Pratt. Prin. Prov. 
Sal. Ser. (moderate fullness, sufficient to distinguish), Spr. StLP. (as far 
as can be readily found), Wat. Well. (no extensive searching), Wore 
Yale. 
b Omit (especially in French and German) such names as are not 
ordinarily used by the author. Amh. BA. Bowd. (formerly gave names in 
full), Bry. (fill out initials if possible), Col. (less known names given in 
full), EnPr.* Forbes (pursues a middle course), Harv. How. (as correctly 
as possible, not as full as possible), MIT. (give as full as ever used by 
the author), Man. (fill out initials, but never search for unused names), 
Pratt* Sal.* Stan. 
¢ Follow the title-page in hand, and give but little investigation. 
Buf. (except in cases where identification is necessary), Min. (did attempt 
to find full names, but now believe it to be wasted time to do more than 
follow title-page except in rare cases). NYM. PhL. (added information 
is bracketed elsewhere), StLM. (unless necessary to give full name for 
identification).

8. ENTRY OF PSEUDONYMOUS WORKS. 
The rule to enter under the real name when it can be found and refer 
from the pseudonym is still followed by the larger number of libraries, 
many making occasional exceptions, but the following libraries reverse 
the rule and enter under the pseudonym when it is customarily used 
by the author, and refer from the real name, BA. Brown. Buf. Cal. Drex. 
EnPr. (in finding-lists), Forbes. GrRap. Harv,* MIT. (to a limited extent). 
Man. Mil. (card catal.) NHav. NYFC. NYM. PhL. Sal.* StLM. StLP. Stan. 
Wat.* Wore. 
9. ENTRY OF ANONYMOUS WORKS OF UNKNOWN AUTHORSHIP. 
The general rule is to enter under the first word not an article, but 
the following libraries except prepositions also and enter under the 
first word not an article or preposition, Bowd. BrY. Harv. (except fic- 
tion) MIT. NYM. PhM. Prov. Stan. Yale. A third method is to enter 
under the first prominent word, but while this is occasionally resorted 
to by Newb. Ost. and Well. it is only Cin. which makes a practice of it, 
and this library excepts fiction. 
a Anonymous biographic works. Most libraries make an exception 
of these and enter under the name of the person only; such are Ast. 
Bos. Bowd. BrL. BrY. Cal. Cam. Cin. Clev. Corn. EnPr. Harv. How. Mich. 
NYFC. NYM. NYS. NYY. Newb. Newt. Ost. Scr. Spr. Stan. Wore; also the 
following which occasionally make a title-entry also, Amh. Arm, Buf. Det, 
Forbes, Mil. Min. PhL. 
b Anonymous works relating to a place. A smaller number of libra- 
ries make an exception of these works also and enter only under the 
name of the place; such are Ast. Bowd. BrL. BrY. Cal. Cam. Cin. Clev. 
EnPr. How. NYFC. NYM. NYY. Newb. Spr. Stan.; also the following which 
occasionally make a title-entry also, Amh. Buf. Det. Forbes, Mil, Min. 
Newt. Phi. 
10 ENGLISH NOBLEMEN. 
Usage is not very unevenly divided in the treatment of these trouble- 
some persons; the following libraries make their rule to enter them 
under their titles, generally with references from their family names, 
Amb, Ast. (usually), BrY. Brown (generally), Buf. (unless family name is 
better known), Cal. (usually), Cam. Chic. Col. Corn. Drex. (unless family 
name is much better known), EnPr. (on finding-list), Forbes, HartP. 
Harv.* Jers. MIT. Mil. (on cards), Min. NHav. NYFC. NYM. NYS (with a 
few exceptions), NYY. PhL. PhM. Pratt, Sal. Scr. StLM. StLP. Stan. Well. 
Wore.; while the following enter in general under the family name and 
refer from the title, Arm, (usually), BA. Bos. Bowd. BrL. Cin. Clev. Cong. 
Det. EnPr. (on cards), Harv. How. LosA. Man. (unless title is better 
known), Mich. Mil. (printed catal.), Newb. Newt. Ost. Peab, Prin. Prov. 
Spr. Wat. Yale.

11 NAMES OF SOVEREIGNS. 
While most names when used as headings should te written in their 
vernacular form, an exception has generally been made for the names 
of sovereigns and these are usually given in their English form. A 
few libraries however write these also in their proper vernacular; they 
are Brown (in general), Cong. Drex. GrRap. HartTh. Jers: MIT. (for more 
common languages), Mil. (on printed catal.), NYFC. NYS. (with brief 
second entry under English), Newt. (recent change), Prov. 
12 NAMES OF CITIES. 
The general custom has been to use the proper vernacular form for 
the names of cities and towns unless a different English form were 
well established, as e. g. Munich for Miinchen, Florence for Firenze. 
The following libraries however use the vernacular form in all cases, 
Cal. Cin. Cong. NYS. Prin. Prov. 
13 ENTRY OF SOCIETIES, ETC. 
The best method to pursue in entering societies in an alphabetic 
catalog has always beeii a difficult question and one that has received 
many answers. There are at least five distinct systems each in use by 
a number of libraries, though it should be said that few libraries are 
altogether consistent in following the rule they adopt. 
a Enter always under first word of title. Bos. Clev. (under first 
distinctive word), Cong. Corn. (except foreign universities), Det. (with 
references from familiarly used titles), EnPr. HartP. Jers. LosA. Mich. 
(sometimes under name of place), NHav. Newt. Ost. PhL. Prin.* Stan. 
b Enter under the name of the place where situated. Ast. Cin. PhM. 
Prin. Spr. Wat. Yale. Amh. and How. follow sometimes one rule and some- 
times the other of these two. 
c Enter under the name of the place when that enters into the name 
of the society, in other cases under the first word. BrL. Brown, Harv. 
NYM. Well. 
d Enter English and American societies under the first word, others 
under the name of the place. BA. Cal. Col. (with many variations), 
HartTh. Man. NYY. Newb. Peab. (not incl. all foreign societies), Wore. 
e The “5th plan” proposed by Mr. Cutter in his rules, § 56. The 
details of this plan are too long to state here, but in general it inclines 
to entry under the first word of the corporate name except for local 
bodies and foreign universities. Arm. Bowd.* Cam. Chic. Drex. Forbes, 
MIT. (with some further enlargement of exception 7), Mil. (with some 
differences, see Linderfelt’s Eclectic rules, §§ 200), Minn, NYFC. NYS. 
Pratt, Prov. Sal. Ser. (with exceptions), StLP. 
* Librarian favors particular practice named rather than some other which is in 
actual us.

    EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  14 ENTRY OF SERIES. 
Most libraries now enter a series (as American commonwealths, 
English men of letters, &c.) under the first word of the title, unless 
better known by the editor’s name, and often with reference from the 
editor, but the older practice was to enter under the editor as being 
properly the author of the series. The following are the only libraries 
ot those asked who retain this rule, BA. BrY. Cin. Clev. HartTh. Harv. 
NYFC. Ost. Peab. Prin, BA, NYFC. and Harv. express their preference 
for the rule now generally followed.

Yale arrange these letters as if they were written «, @ and ue. Prov. 
treats them as separate characters. 
16 INDICATION OF SIZES. 
The fold symbols 8°, 4°, &e, are used by Ast. Bos, BrL. Cam. Chic. 
Cin. Cong. Corn. Det. Harv. How. NYM. Newb. Peab. Prin. Spr. Wat. Well. 
(on author eds.), Wore. Yale, and are preferred by BA. The letter abbre- 
viations, O., Q., &c., are used by Amh, Arm. BA. Bowd. BrY. Brown, Buf. 
Cal. Clev. Col. Drex. Forbes, Jers. LosA. MIT. Mich. Mil. Min. NHav. NYS. 
NYY. Newt. Ost. PhL. PhM. Pratt, Sal. StLP. Stan. Well. (subj.cds). The 
hight measurement in centimeters is given by Clev. EnPr. (formerly used. 
fold symbols), HartP. HartTh. and Prov. and is approved by Prin. The 
measurement in inches is given by Bos. for os books, and is 
approved by StLM. 
All indication of size is omitted by GrRap. Man. NYFC. Pratt (except 
the larger and smaller sizes), Ser. and StLM. 
17 PAGING. 
The number of pages is given on the catalog by Arm. (main pag- 
ing only), Bos. Bowd. BrY. Cin. (for works in 1 to 5 vols.), Clev. Cal. Cong. 
Corn. Det. Drex. (main paging only), HartP, MIT. (without too much 
detail), Mich. Min. NHav, NYS. NYY. Ost. (except fiction), PhL. PhM. Sal. 
(without detail), Stan. (on author cds.), Well. (on subj. cds. without 
detail). Many of the above omit paging altogether if the work is in 
more than one volume.

-P-A-G-E-857
  THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 847 
The number of pages is given only when less than 100 by. Amh, Brown, 
Cal. Forbes, Newb. Peab. Stan. (on subject cds.) Wat. and Yale; when less 
than 100 or over 600 by Harv.; and when less than 50 or over 500 by 
Pratt; all of these omit it in other cases. Sal. recommends giving the 
pages only when less than 50. The number of pages is omitted in all 
eases (except, it may be, incunabula, ete.) by Ast. BA, BrL. Buf. Cam. 
Chic. EnPr. GrRap. HartTh. How. Jers. (except in accession-book), LosA. 
Man. Mil. NYFC. NYM. Newt. Prin. Prov. (except in accession-book), Ser, 
Spr. StLM. StLP. Well. (on author eds.), Wore. 
18 NAMES OF ARTISTS. 
Artists, especially those of the medieval and Renaissance periods, are 
often better known under sobriquets than under their family or bap- 
tismalnames. The following libraries give the preference to the sobri- 
quet over the real name as a heading: Amh. Arm. Ast. BA. Bos. (some- 
times), Bowd. BrL. BrG. Brown. Buf. (formerly entered under the real 
name), Cal, Cam. Chie. Clev. Col, Drex. EnPr. (on finding-list), Forbes, 
HartTh. Harv.* Jers. LosA. Man. Mich. Mil. (on card catal.) Min. NHav. 
NYM. NYS. Newt. Peab. PhL, PhM. Pratt. Sal. Scr. StLM. StLP. Stan. Wore. 
Yale. 
The following enter under the real name: Cin, Cong. Corn, Det, EnPr. 
(on card. catal), GrRap. HartP. Harv. How. Mil. (printed catal), NYFC. 
NYY. Newb. Ost. Prin. Prov. Spr. Well. 
19 TRANSLITERATION, 
The rules and tables compiled by a committee of the A. L. A. and 
printed in the Library journal, 10: 302 and in the appendix to Cutter’s 
rules have been generally adopted by those librarians which have occa- 
sion to transliterate, but BrL. HartTh. Newb. Peab. and StLP. state that 
they do not use them. Det. sometimes follows other catalogs and Corn, 
follows the British Museum for Sanskrit names. 
20 SUBJECT HEADINGS IN A DICTIONARY CATALOG. 
Sections 96 and 97 of Cutter’s rules provide that ‘‘a work treating of 
a general subject with special reference to a place” shall be “entered 
under the place with merely a reference from the subject,” that is, that 
subject headings shall be made subordinate to place headings and not — 
place headings to subject headings, that headings such as “Boston, 
Biography,” “New York, Geology,” “Greece, Art,” “France, Law,” and 
the like shall be used rather than “Geology, New York,” “Music, Ger- 
nwny,” “Seulpture, Greece,” and the like. 
The following libraries hold in general to the rule as laid down by 
Cutter: Ast. (except in some philosophical subjects), BA. Bos. (not con- 
sidered satisfactory by itself; special lists in the Bulletin give the 
*Librarian favors particular practice named rather than some other which is in 
actual use.

advantages of the other system), Cam. Chic. (in general, in the old 
catal.), Col. (follow the method which seems in each case most useful, 
with strong leaning from experience to the Cutter rule), Det. GrRap. 
Min. NYM. NYY. Newt. (entries often made under both forms), Peab. 
Pratt, Sal. StLP. (dict. catal. of juvenile literature only), Wat. Wore. 
Many libraries however now incline especially in art and science 
subjects to make the place subordinate to the subject heading; such 
are Amh. BA.* Bowd. BrL. BrY. Brown, Cal. Clev. Cong. Corn. -Drex. EnPr. 
Forbes, Jers. LosA. (in all cases except literature and history), Man. 
Mich. Mil. Min.* NHav. NYFC. Newb. Ost. PhM. Prin. (much of the old 
work on the other basis, making double entry frequently necessary), 
Ser. Spr. StLM. Stan. Wat.* (for a large catalog). HartP. and Prov. enter 
in both ways, and How. replies that it “gives equal prominence to 
subject and place.” 
The A. L. A. appointed a committee in 1892 to study the question of 
subject headings and report. They reported to the Chicago Conference 
in 1893 (see the Proceedings, p. 79) treating of certain general princi- 
ples and attempting to draw the line between subjects which can best 
be made subdivisions under places and those which should themselves 
have place subdivisions under them. In 1894 the same committee 
reported a plan for a list of subject headings which was approved by 
the Association and is to be published by its publishing section. 
A list of the 58 libraries follows, from whose replies the facts stated 
above in regard to catalog and cataloging have been drawn: The

  ~850 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Musrecms, ART GALLERIES, AND LECTURES IN CONNECTION WITH 
PuBiic LIBRARIES. 
By Jamzs Bary, Jr., Chief Librarian, Toronto Public Library. 
The chapter by Professor Frieze, in the report on the Publie Libraries 
of the United States, by the Bureau of Education for 1876, on “Art 
museums and their connection with public libraries” was the first offi- 
cial proposal to extend the work of public libraries. It does not seem 
to have commended itself to American libraries, for few, if any, insti- 
tutions based on his proposed lines have been organized since that 
date. As he then pointed out, the collection of paintings and sculpture 
exhibited by the Boston Atheneum was the only one of the kind con- 
nected with a library, and speaking of the value of this, he says that 
he and many others look back with gratitude to the comparatively 
small and humble art museum of this institution as the training school 
to which he owes in a great degree his power to appreciate the rich 
treasures of sculpture and painting in the Old World. In 1881 Mr. 
James Hibbert Preston, England, printed for private distribution 
“Notes on free public libraries and museums” which formed part of 
the materials collected to assist in framing the groundwork of a report 
on the proposed Harris Free Library and Museum, in which he reviewed 
the history and present condition of the public libraries of Europe and 
America and pressed strongly the claims of an art gallery and museum 
to form part of the proposed library. In the same year the late Dr. 
Holmes, of the New York State Library, Albany, proposed, in a valuable 
paper read at the Washington conference of the A. L. A., to go further 
than Professor Frieze, and urged the addition of popular museums as 
wellas of art galleries to public libraries, calling attention to the remark- 
- able series of amendments in the laws of the United Kingdom specially 
directed to thisend. In the discussion which followed, the two speakers 
who opposed the views of Dr. Holmes stated that they did not think 
it expedient to divert any part of the taxes for libraries to the mainte- 
nance of museums, lectures, or concerts. ‘Where a town or city can 
get only a small amount of money for educational purposes, it is best 
not to run the risk of dividing this amount too much in trying to further 
several objects. The result might be, poor schools, a poor library, and 
a poor museum.” Mr, 8. 8, Green said that in Worcester the library 
was closely connected with the natural history society and two art 
societies, which freely used the books in the library individually and in 
classes. The feeling of the convention was evidently against Dr. 
Holmes’s proposals. 
At the Lake George conference of the A. L. A., 1885, Dr. Holmes 
read a supplement to his paper, rehearsing the history of the move- 
ment in the United Kingdom, and again urging the adoption of a 
similar act in the various States of the Union. No discussion of the
-P-A-G-E-861

  paper is reported. Among the papers read at the Birmingham meeting 
of the L. A. U. K., 1887, was one by C. Whitworth Wallis, curator of 
the Birmingham art galleries and museum, on the connection between 
free libraries and art galleries and museums, which elicited considerable 
interest. The writer was fortunate in being able to review the success- 
ful career of an institution which he had been instrumental in building 
up and of being able to exhibit it to the members of the association in 
daily working order. Mr. Thomas Greenwood published in 1888 a ~ 
book on Museums and Art Galleries, which contains a general history of 
museums in Great Britain and Ireland with a detailed description of 
the more important, together with a brief account of those in Amer- 
ica, Germany, France, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, and Italy. It is 
of special value for its descriptions and statistics of rate-supported 
museums and art galleries of the United Kingdom, almost all of which 
are connected with public libraries. The aids to popularizing the 
museum are worthy of careful consideration. Inquiries made at the 
Baltimore meeting of the adjourned Lakewood convention of the A. 
L, A., 1892, as to what had been done in this direction by any members 
failed to draw any response, but the president-elect, Mr. Dewey, stated 
that he was disposed to view the matter in a different light from that 
of former days, and recommended careful consideration of the question 
as preparatory to fuller discussion at a future meeting. 
Desirability — Libraries combined with museums in the same insti- 
tution are desirable for a double purpose. One is that museums of 
science and art have an intrinsie value in themselves for the education 
of any community. The other is that the association of the free 
public library with free museums, in the same building and under the 
same trustees, increases the utility of and interest in both, with the least 
expenditure. The museums contemplated are of any and every kind 
attainable—of science, art, or both together. They should be allowed 
to embrace all objects which it might suit the means, the taste, or the 
generosity of the citizens of a town to supply. In art, they would by 
no means be limited to collections of paintings and sculpture, but would 
embrace every form of production from the hand of man. A mere 
enumeration of the objects which properly compose such art museums 
indicates the vastness of the field from which the supply is to be 
drawn: Pottery and porcelain; carvings in wood, ivory, and shell; inlaid 
and lacquered work; jewelry, and works in gold, silver, copper, brass, 
and iron; textile manufactures, laces, embroidery, and carpets; articles 
of furniture and house decoration; arms and armor; engraved gems, 
coins, medals, seals; illustrations of architecture, engraving, typog- 
raphy, ancient manuscripts, historic pictures and portraits. Many of 
the above carry with them the idea of archeology, and the collections 
would naturally receive whatever would portray ancient Europe, Rome, 
Greece, Egypt, and Assyria, reaching back to the prehistoric period. 
The New World would be exhibited by the earliest memorials of human

existence to be found here, coming down to all such as illustrate the 
civilization and customs of the native races of this hemisphere to the 
present time. There remains to be enumerated museums of natural 
science, embracing the animal and vegetable kingdom and inorganic 
matter.”! 
Of the value of such museums there can be little difference of opinion; 
as means of educating, of awakening interest in science and art in 
untrained minds, of stimulating and guiding historic and artistic taste, 
as affording storehouses for the numberless articles which we would 
fain preserve for the pleasure and instruction of future generations, 
the museum should be as necessary to the city or town as the free 
library. Mr. Emerson sounds the true note: “I wish to find in my own 
town a library and museum which is the property of the town, where 
Iecan deposit this precious treasure, where I and my children can 
see it from time to time, and where it has its proper place among 
hundreds of such donations from other citizens who have brought 
thither whatever articles they have judged to be in their nature a pub- 
lic rather than a private property. A collection of this kind, the prop- 
erty of each town, would dignify the town, and we should love and 
respect our neighbors more; obviously, it would be easy for every 
town to discharge this truly municipal duty.” ” 
The advantage of uniting tle public library, museum, and art gallery 
under one management are equally apparent, either from the stand- 
point of utility or of expense. The power of referring directly from 
the printed description to the work of art is of immense value to the art 
student and art worker. No book can convey the same impression as 
the article itself; nor, on the other hand, can the student fully appreci- 
ate the work of art till his attention has been drawn directly to its 
salient features. The student or the miner may pore over Dana’s 
Mineralogy fer hours without getting that definite idea of the appear- 
ance and character of any mineral that he would gain in as many min- 
utes by aid of the museum specimen. With books and specimens the 
young archeologist or ethnologist realizes rapidly what we know of our 
predecessors on this continent or of the condition of the yet uncivilized 
races of the earth. In all branches of art and science the book and 
specimen are complementary and should be drawn together as closely 
as possible. American librarians have not strongly disputed these 
statements, but have rested their opposition to the union with either 
museums or art galleries on two strong practical objections: 
1. That the librarian has quite enough to do to look after his books; 
and 
2. That all available funds are required for buying books and main- 
taining the library.

With the first objection I will deal when considering how libraries 
and museums should be managed, and for the second see whether any 
light can be obtained from abroad. 
History in the United Kingdom.—In the United Kingdom private and 
semiprivate libraries have grown up side by side, and it is curious to 
notice that the museums were the first to be made free. The relics of 
Britain’s varied civilization during successive centuries constituted a 
treasure of archeological and antiquarian interest which could not well 
be looked for in newer lands, and which continued to inspire the anti- 
quary to entrancing but unrequited toil, gathering together materials 
for a museum. When to these were added the gleanings from foreign 
lands, brought by collector, traveler, or sailor, and later when the nat- 
ural sciences awakened a love for systematized collections of rocks, 
plants, animals, birds, and shells, the museum assumed proportions 
which compelled attention to the necessity for providing proper accom- 
modation and supervision. 
To depend upon voluntary subscriptions was to insure a slow and 
painful extinction. The dusty and moth-eaten collection in a dark 
room, rarely visited, was proverbial. The museums act of 1845, by which 
public free museums were authorized to be established in cities and 
boroughs containing not less than 10,000 inhabitants was the first step 
toward putting things on a popular basis. By the museum and libra- 
ries act of 1850, the act of 1845 was repealed, and town councils were 
authorized to establish public libraries and museums in towns where a 
two-thirds vote could be secured. This act restricted the library rate 
to a half-penny in the pound, and the amount raised was only applicable 
to maintaining a museum and library when formed, and did not allow 
any part of the funds to be expended in buying books for the library 
or specimens forthe museum. The public libraries act of 1855 extended 
these powers and authorized increasing the library rate to one: penny 
in the pound, and also the appropriation of any part of the rate to the 
purchase of books and specimens. Amendments were made to this act, 
in 1866, 1868, 1871, 1877, 1884, 1885, which, among other improvements, 
gave permission to any public library, museum, school of science or art, 
or art gallery, to add any or all of these to its institution, and extended 
the provisions of the public libraries act to smaller parishes in com- 
bination, any two or more of which having an aggregate population 
exceeding 5,000 persons, are empowered, after taking the necessary 
legal steps, to establish a public library or museum, or both. As the 
most prominent example in the world, the British Museum at once 
occurs to every mind. But while exhibiting the advantages of combi- 
nation, its national character places it on an entirely different footing 
from those under consideration. 
In 1888, 41 free public libraries and museums or art galleries, or both, 
were in operation. There were also 3 libraries and museums supported 
by subscription, and 8 free museums, Salford (population, 198,140) and 
   
-P-A-G-E-864
854 - EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Warrington (population, 45,253) were the first to adopt the act of 1846. 
The former opened its museum in 1850, when its population was only 
87,533, and art gallery in 1854, and between these dates and 1880 over 
15,000,000 visitors were admitted, and the annual issue of books in the 
library had risen to 386,528. The books, pictures, specimens, and build- 
ings were valued at from $300,000 to $350,000. The city of Liverpool 
(population, 517,950) is an excellent and well-known example of the suc- 
cess which has attended the effort to combine the different institutions 
under a common government for a common good. One of the striking 
features which catches the eye of the traveler on landing at Liverpool is 
the handsome group of buildings which crown the rising ground in the 
center of the city. It is the combined free library, museum, lecture 
hall, and picture gallery which public enterprise and private benefi- 
cence have given to the citizens. First established as a library in 1852, 
it now contains in the lending library 60,147 volumes, and issued for 
home reading in 1892 463,256, besides 636,860 used in the reading 
rooms. It also contains 101,262 volumes in its reference library, from 
which 201,705 were issued in 1892, In addition to this, 327,448 persons . 
visited the museum, 619,647 the art gallery, and 38,611 attended the 
lectures. The building for the library and museum was given by Sir 
William Brown in 1860 and the art gallery in 1871. The rate produced 
in 1892, £11,300, which, with the small fee charged for entry to the loan 
exhibition, seems to be the entire revenue of the institution, though the 
committee state that owing to a falling off in the amount of. the rate, 
“it would have been impossible to maintain the institutions in their 
present state of efficiency” without an extra grant from the city coun- 
cil. The report of 1891 says “the desire of the committee is to popu- 
larize the noble and unique group of institutions under their control 
and to avail themselves of all the many and varied opportunities they 
afford for the education and entertainment of the people.” In 1892 they 
report “that free lectures have now for a period of twenty-eight years 
formed part—and in their resuits a most important part—of the educa- 
tional work carried on in connection with these institutions,” and furnish 
a list of thirty-one lectures on science, history, geography, and art, 
illustrated by experiment or lime light. The museum has been enriched 
by such magnificent gifts as the Philips collection of minerals, the 
Austin collection of fossils, the Mariat collection of shells, the Earl of 
Derby’s collection of mammals and birds, comprising 20,000 specimens, 
the Mayal collection of historical art treasures, and numerous smaller 
collections of interest and value. The art gallery has also been increased 
by frequent gifts, so that the permanent collection forms the nucleus 
of a grand gallery which will continue to attract visitors at times 
when the loan exhibitions are at an end. The number of visitors and 
the continuous increase of readers in the library seems to be the fitting 
answer to the anticipations of the committee “that one of the primary 
inducements to forming the collections was to instruct not only through  
-P-A-G-E-865
    THE WORLD'S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 855 
the works themselves, but also through the literature in the library.” 
And we find expressly noted in the report for 1892 the large increase 
in books on science and art. 
The Birmingham library has a somewhat similar record. Established 
as a library in.1860, it was not till 1864 that the first steps were taken 
to form an art gallery, and not till 1870 when the formation of an indus- 
trial museum was commenced.. Soon it was found that the compara- 
tively small rooms were overcrowded, and the committee were compelled 
to remove both the museum and art collections to Ashton Hall, about 
24 miles from the city. But in 1881 arrangements were completed 
with the municipal authorities enabling the generosity of private indi- 
viduals to endow the beautiful building near the library. In 1891 the 
library contained in the reference department 110,759 volumes, and 
the number issued was 375,092. The lending library also contained 
58,471 volumes, with an issue for home reading of 480,004. The 
number of visitors to the museum and art galleries in 1888, the last 
year for which I have statistics, was 1,105,268. The proceeds of the 
rate in 1891 was £9,874 9s. 10d., and £679 11s. 4d. was realized from 
catalogs, fines, ete., making a total of £10,554 1s. 2d. This sum was 
absorbed by the main library and branches; but gifts covered the addi- 
tional expense of the museum and art gallery. This does not seem a 
large expenditure for so large and wealthy a city as Birmingham (pop- 
ulation, 429,170), and shows what can be done by careful and energetic 
extension in all directions. Mr. Wallis thus sums up the “relations 
which exist between this free library, art gallery, and museum: First 
of all their aims are identical, for they have in view the one end, the 
culture of the people; secondly, they appeal to the same mental facul- 
ties with which all men are endowed in a greater or less degree; and 
thirdly, to a very great extent one of them, the museum, to carry out . 
its proper functions to a great measure is dependent upon the other, 
the library. It leans upon it, as it were; it looks to it to minister to 
the museum visitors that knowledge and information which the most 
comprehensive catalog and labels in the world would fail to supply. 
In a ease like Birmingham this is particularly the case, for the books 
on art and art workmanship are, as a rule, beyond the reach of the ordi- 
nary workman, and his appetite having been whetted by a slight deserip- 
tion of some object or process in the museum, he must of necessity have 
recourse to the library to acquire further knowledge.” 
Other instances might be given of the success of the joint institu- 
tions in the United Kingdom, and reference made to Booth (pop- 
ulation, 27,354), Bradford (population, 216,360), Dundee (population, 
155,680), Exeter (population, 47,154), Leicester (population, 47,154), 
Nottingham (population, 211,984), Sheffield (population, 324,240), 
Swansea (population, 55,417). But sufficient has been said to show: 
1. That the union of the three institutions has been successful in the 
United Kingdom.   
 
-P-A-G-E-866
      856 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
2. That it is possible to carry on all the work on the moderate rate 
which the act permits them to collect. 
3. That invariably museums and art galleries under proper manage- 
ment commend themselves so much to the wealthy that a large pro- 
portion of their contents are given or lent. 
Mr. Justin Winsor! was struck by the fact “that the public library 
system in this country (England) takes on, in its museums of antiqui- 
ties, an adjunct in the popular instruction which we have failed in 
America to embrace in its agencies. The local antiquary and archzol- 
ogist has here a recognized duty beside the public librarian. I found 
at Worcester, for instance, that on the inner walls of the library build- 
ing were painted geological charts of the neighborhood, thus present- 
ing to the minds of the young the place in the development of the 
country’s surface of the remains to be seen in the cases. Similar helps, 
Iwas told, were arranged in the library at Shrewsbury. I have met 
everywhere with people who were popularizing a knowledge of the local 
British and Roman antiquities, and one can not fail to see how the 
dissemination of such information makes more intelligent readers for 
such books as Green’s Making of England.” 
Mr. Greenwood,? speaking of the museum and gymnasium act of 
1891 says: “Here again, as with the libraries, the towns have not been 
slow to avail themselves of the power conveyed by these acts. Public 
library and museum must necessarily go hand in hand, and our hope is 
that wherever there is one of the institutions the twin brother should 
“soon come into operation.” 
After some years’ experience Mr. Hibbert (Preston) says: ‘‘ The views 
that I have expressed in my notes as to the conjunction of libraries and 
museums I still hold. <A library considered as a means of public 
instruction is incomplete without a museum, both as respects the fine 
arts and physical science.” 
In the United States——In the United States the conditions of life were 
different from those in the older lands. The population was sparser, 
the means of obtaining a higher education more limited, and collections 
of books were only to be found in the older cities of the Eastern sea- 
board, and there in colleges and private houses. It was natural, there- 
fore, that the demand only extended to free libraries. Once established 
the energies of the librarian and trustees were expended in increasing 
the number of volumes and extending the facilities for reading. The 
soil also yielded few antiquities. The stone tools and weapons of the 
Indian were indeed found in many districts, but they did not convey to 
the finder the same human interest which the Roman, Saxon, and Norman 
remains did to their fellow-workersin Europe. Nor had natural history 
collections in any general sense been begun. But in forty years great 
changes have taken place. Libraries have been established over the 
        
1 Nation: 51,244, 2 Review of Reviews, May, 1893.
-P-A-G-E-867
  THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 857 
whole country—many of them in large and beautiful buildings. The 
number of books per capita has become equal to almost any country 
in the world. Annual meetings of the A. L. A. have directed the atten- 
tion of librarians to many channels through which to extend the 
knowledge of the contents of their books and of increasing their use. 
Does it not seem as if the time had come to adopt fuller and more per- 
fect methods of reaching, directing, and stimulating the popular taste? 
In 1876 Professor Frieze was able to point to the instance of the Bos- 
ton Athenzum as the single example of an art gallery in connection 
with a library, and the position yet remains unaltered. But a natural 
movement in the direction of extension is taking place. In 1885 Min- 
nesota granted a charter to Minneapolis creating a board with power 
“to establish and maintain public libraries and reading rooms, galleries 
of art and museums.” This library has partially availed itself of the 
power and possesses some valuable paintings, and has on loan for exhi- 
bition some casts from the antique, keramics, tapestries, and miscella- 
neous specimens of art workmanship. The New York Free Circulating 
Library reports (1889) that ‘all the libraries have been enriched by a 
gift of a series of fine steel engravings, permanent photographs, and 
casts of celebrated sculptures. These have been selected with discrim- 
ination and care, appropriately framed, and placed on the walls. The 
series comprises historical, geographic, and artistic illustrations from 
the works of the best artists, and greatly promote a taste for books on 
these subjects. A zest for reading is encouraged in this way: Under a 
fine line engraving of Washington or Napoleon is placed a list of all 
the works in the library relating to him or his period; under the pho- 
tographs of the best monuments of Egypt is a list of books relating to 
Egyptian art and history, while Raphael and his best known Madonnas, 
and casts from Lucca della Robbia and other Italian artists serve to 
introduce the literature of Italian art.” 
Worcester, Toronto, and some other libraries report that the exhibi- 
tion of the prints of the Arundel Society have tended to awaken an 
interest in art and the history of these times, while others by the 
exhibition of illuminated manuscripts, artistic printing and binding, 
are working to the same end. Malden, Mass., reports (1888) even more 
decidedly. “If there has ever been a doubt as to the expediency of con- 
necting an art gallery with a public library it has been dispelled in our 
experience, for we can see many advantages which have arisen from 
their connection. Visitors who might otherwise have never come to 
the library are gradually brought within its influence by the means 
which attract them. Better still the gallery is a most important and 
helpful companion to our books; for its pictures, all of which are good, 
and several excellent, may often answer questions which the books can 
not, or create an interest which the book may afterwards foster. There 
is a sincere art spirit among our people which the library has done 
much to stimulate and which the gallery will tend to extend and per- 
   
-P-A-G-E-868
    858 EDUCATION “REPORT, 1892-93. 
petuate.. A useful adjunct to both the library and the gallery which 
will come in time will be a collection of photographs of the world’s great 
pictures, so that the student may become acquainted with them by 
sight as well as by name. Such a collection, arranged by schools, or 
by galleries, and correctly named, could not fail to awaken interest, if 
not enthusiasm, in those who might view them, and would be worth its 
cost in the cause of popular or individual art education.” 
A different method of combining: library and museum has been 
adopted by the Salem public library.! “By way of increasing the edu- 
cational value of the collection in the museum and of giving illustra- 
tions to readers of books in the public library, a system of reference 
eards has been adopted by the officers of the Peabody Academy of 
Sciences, giving the author’s name, title, and call number of such books 
in the Salem public library as treat of the specimen or group of speci- 
mens on which the cards are placed. With our normal and high 
schools, and the proximity of numerous other schools and academies of 
higher grade in neighboring towns, it is of the utmost importance that 
these scientific and educational institutions should work in harmony in 
order to be of the greatest value to the public.” 
The Buffalo public library has arranged its beautiful building so as 
to lodge the natural history museum, the art gallery, and the His- 
torical Society Museum under the same roof. 
In 1883 the Province of Ontario passed an act authorizing the estab- 
lishment, by board specially appointed, of free libraries, museums, and 
art galleries, but while free libraries have been formed, none have 
availed themselves of the full power of the act. 
Finally, the State of New York has, in amending and consolidating 
its university law, inserted a clause which should afford a model to 
every State in the Union: 
Sxc. 35. All provisions of sections thirty-five to forty-one shall apply equally to 
libraries, museums, and to combined libraries and museums; and the word “library” 
shall be construed to include reference and circulating libraries and reading rooms. 
(Laws of New York, 1892, ch. 378, approved April 27, 1892.) 
It is evident, therefore, that we are drifting in the direction of com- 
bined libraries, museums or art galleries, or both, and that the combina- 
tion is gradually approving itself for its educational and refining 
influences. The economy with which they can be carried on under the 
present organization is patent from the example of similar institutions 
in the United Kingdom. Our aim should be, not to rush into the forma- 
tion of large specialized museums or expensive art galleries, but quietly 
to work them up as necessary parts of the library, and if carried on in 
this manner the annual expense will form a very small portion of the 
grant, and will, on the other hand, lead to greater liberality on the 
part of the authorities.

Hints for management.—Do not be afraid to start with a small collec- 
tion. It will soon grow. Get the reporters to write up in the local 
papers the donations as they arrive, and make it generally known that 
you want specimens. You will speedily have plenty offered, if you 
will undertake to supply cases. Some of the best museums in the 
United States do not buy anything. Reserve always the right to 
exclude what is useless or at least valueless for your purposes. Set 
out with a definite idea of what form you intend your museum to take 
and it will be comparatively easy to mold it. In some localities you 
can enlist the services of members of the natural history, the historical, 
or art societies in the work who will relieve the librarian from much 
difficulty in making a beginning. Place your collections of specimens 
or pictures in a spare room or rooms well lighted and arranged for 
extension. Every new library building should be planned to afford 
ample accommodation of the best kind. Never permit, even tempo- 
rarily, any cases or pictures to be left in the library proper, as a door- 
way would be opened at once to talking and disorder which it will be 
difficult to correct. Above alla special assistant with some knowledge 
of the natural sciences must be appointed, with complete charge under 
the general guidance of the librarian, who must be left free to attend 
to his regular work. It is nota difficult matter to obtain the services of 
a young lady with college training, with a real love for the work, who 
could take charge, do the labeling, enter all arrivals in the accession 
book, and be able to give as much information to visitors as is requisite 
in most small museums. As it need not be open more than six or eight 
hours a day, not more than one is required. 
The connection with the books must be closely maintained, not only 
by giving references to special books, but by exhibiting side by side 
the special illustrations referring to them, or by erecting in close prox- 
imity small shelves on which can be placed the most convenient manu- * 
als. As for example, Le Conte’s Geology, Nicholson’s Paleontology, 
Dana’s Mineralogy, Gray’s Botany, Packard’s Entomology, Nuttall’s 
Ornithology, Abbott’s Primitive Industry. The label on each specimen 
should be very clear and distinct, giving the scientific and common 
name, the locality whence it came, and the name and address of the 
donor. As each library should be the repository of the local printed 
matter, so each museum should aim first at having a thorough repre- 
sentation of the natural physical characteristics and fauna and flora 
of the surrounding district, so that the stranger will be able, almost at 
a glance, to see the leading features of the country, and the young thus 
accustomed to observe their own, will be better able to examine intelli- 
gently collections of other and larger cities and more comprehensive 
institutions. Much may be done by a large relief model of the sur- 
rounding country or by geological sections painted on the wall. In 
manufacturing cities, specimens of raw materials under all stages of 
manufacture are of great interest, and, when supplemented by like 
 
-P-A-G-E-870
  
      EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  specimens from abroad, form a technological museum of a highly valu- 
able character. 
If free lectures can be arranged, having for their subject the contents 
of any of the cases or of books bearing on them, a wider interest is 
roused in both library and museum. Let your lecturers be men, how- 
ever humble, who understand their special work, not mere general 
talkers. If, in addition, occasional open nights can be arranged, when 
some special attraction is announced, many wili be induced to enter and 
remain in the building who in ordinary course would misspend their 
time elsewhere. Collections of art workmanship and pictures are very 
attractive, and loan exhibitions can almost always be provided atleast 
once a year. Valuable paintings are becoming more numerous in the 
homes of our wealthy citizens, and, except in rare cases, can be readily 
borrowed for public exhibition. Temporary exchanges with other 
libraries and art galleries of special pictures could be effected, and a 
brief newspaper notice that a new object of art or picture could be seen 
at the public library would stimulate regularly the public attention. 
Following the example of other institutions, a small charge might be 
made to defray extra expenses. As pointed out by Professor Frieze, 
casts of almost all the famous statues can be obtained at small cost, 
and would familiarize the mind of youth with the glories of ancient art. 
Finally, the librarian must never ferget that the museum is neither a 
storehouse nor a bazaar, but an additional means of extending and pop- 
ularizing knowledge; therefore his collections are worthless unless 
systematically arranged and his pictures properly described, and that 
at all times the rooms must be kept bright, attractive, and comfortable. 
The curators of the United States National Museum, Washington, and 
of the Cincinnati Art Museum have devised model cases, about which 
they readily give all information.

CLASSIFICATION, 
By Horace Krpiart, Librarian, St. Louis Mercantile Library. 
This paper is limited to arrangement of books on the shelves. 
There is an essential difference between catalog and shelf arrange- 
ment, inasmuch as a title may be duplicated in a catalog, whereas the 
book itself can stand in but one place at a time. A subtler judgment 
must therefore be exercised in shelving books than in making a subject 
catalog, and expediency must sometimes rule, instead of strict logical 
principles; hence it is not surprising that the matter of classification 
on the shelves has not passed beyond the stage of controversy. 
I originally intended to discuss some underlying principles of classifi- 
cation, hoping that we might discover room for further cooperation with- 
out pushing uniformity too far. It seemed to me that if it were shown 
that the admitted faults of our more popular systems were not necessary 
evils, we would have advanced somewhat toward a solution of the 
problem. Indeed, I even went so far as to write a critical examination 
of the field. But the essay grew forbidding by mere bulk, and an 
attempt to condense only resulted in obscurity. Consequently, the 
present chapter is limited to methods now pursued in our larger libra- 
ries, and to the views of their librarians on a few fundamental problems 
which beset the classifier, 
Such a conspectus should have more than statistical value, since the © 
literature of classification which has appeared in this country within 
the past twenty years, though extensive, is the work of but a few men, 
and does not show the conclusions of American librarians as a class. 
I regret that space forbids my including a similar showing of the 
various methods employed by our foreign colleagues. Such an addi- 
tion might go towards correcting the tendency to a fatuous provincial- 
ism which is not unknown among us. In default of anything better, I 
append a reference list, which includes foreign as well as native works 
relating to classification. 
Early in 1893 I sent the following circular of inquiry to the head 
of every library in the United States which, so far as I could learn, 
contained 25,000 volumes and upwards. Undoubtedly many smaller 
institutions might have been heard from with profit, but this line was : 
 
-P-A-G-E-872
  
    862 EDUCATION “REPORT, 1892-93. 
chosen as roughly indicating the point beyond which the merits and 
demerits of classification systems are likely to be felt: 
CIRCULAR. 
1 How many volumes are there in your library? 
2 Do you use the Cutter, Dewey, Edmands, Fletcher, Harvard,! Larned,! Perkins, 
Schwartz, or Smith classification?! 
3 If so, do you modify it, and how? What changes in it would you suggest, if it 
were to be made over again? 
4 If you use neither of the above, please give an outline of the main divisions of your 
shelf-classification, with class marks, and examples of your usage in numbering 
books. Ifa synopsis has been printed, a copy of it will suffice. 
5 How long has the present system been used in your library? 
6 If you were to classify your books anew, what method would you adopt? 
7 Do you favor “close” classification (closer, for example, than tke first three figures 
of the Dewey, or first two letters of the Cutter system) ? 
8 Do you think that the mnemonic element in such notations as the Cutter, Dewey, 
Schwartz, is worth what it costs? 
9 Do you find by actual test that close-classification wastes space? 
One hundred and eighty-three circulars were sent out, to which 130 
replies were received. Three libraries reporting had less than 25,000 
volumes, thus leaving 127 available returns. To print these reports in 
full would take too much space, but the gist of them is given in the 
annexed table and abstracts. 
For the benefit of beginners it may be well to define a few of the 
technical terms here used. 
When we sort out a lot of things (minerals, plants, books—no matter 
what) so that similars are grouped together, and then arrange these 
groups into a system, that is a classification, When we assign a distin- 
guishing mark to each number of such a system, that is a notation. 
Classification is a method of work; notation is a mere label to help us 
in handling the material. Itis a mischievous error to confound the two. 
In many libraries'the notation has little or no reference to the scheme 
of classification, the books being numbered according to the shelves 
which they occupy. This, in library parlance, is called fixed location. 
In others, numbers refer to divisions in the classification, and this is 
known as movable or relative location. The difference between these 
methods is clearly shown by Mr. Cutter, as follows: 
The former [fixed] may be compared to the line in the directory which states that 
aman lives at 129 Grace street; the latter [movable] to the Army Register, which 
says that he is captain of Company C, Fifth Regiment, M. V. The-street is immoy- 
able but the regiment may be marched from one part of the country to another, yet 
the map is easily found by his position in it. Similarly books may be found by 
their position in a certain class, though the class itself be moved from one alcove to 
another. If the man moves to anew street a new directory is needed; but the Army 
Register does not have to be altered just because the regiment has been quartered in 
adifferent town. JL. j. 4: 236 [1879]. ¥ 
1Mr. Larned writes me that ‘“The Larne‘ classification was never completed, and 
was never intended to be anything more than a suggestion.” The Harvard -system 
has not been printed in full, See Reference List at end of this article.

THE. WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 
  The terms close classification and broad or loose classification can not 
be defined with any exactness. In general, advocates of broad classi- 
fication would have, at most, only a few hundred subject divisions for a 
miscellaneous library, while the close classitiers often use several thou- 
sand. In Schleiermacher’s Bibliographisches system (1852) there are 
13,016 headings, and the later classifications of Dewey, Hartwig, and 
Cutter are likewise very minutely subdivided. The extremes may be 
illustrated, on the one hand, by the story of the theological library 
(probably mythical) in which the books were disposed on two sides of 
the room, according as they were “sound” or “unsound;” and on the 
other hand, by the rubric 267. 34145 in the Dewey classification, which, 
being interpreted, seems to mean, “In Young Men’s Christian Associa- 
tions, have the general secretary and his assistants, as salaried officers, 
a right to keep company with ladies.”

ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS. 
Library of Congress.—Adjustable or eclectic system; ¢. g.: Political 
economy is numbered 25, Government is 25.7, and the label of a book 
on government might read #3, the denominator being the shelf mark. 
Under each subject books are arranged alphabetically by authors’ 
names, as far as possible, individual biography in six great classes, 
alphabeted by subjects; collective biography, fiction, poetry, polyg- 
raphy, ete., by authors. Would prefer a more thorough subdivision 
of the great classes of subjects, and an extension of alphabetic arrange- 
ment by authors. (Ainsworth R. Spofford, Lib’n.) 
Boston Public.—Books arranged on two sides and ends of a large 
hall, three floors.. Space on each side of hall divided into 10 alcoves of 
10 ranges each. Movable shelves, numbered from bottom, 0, 1, 2, 3, ete, 
up to 9 (or 9 @ if room for supplementary shelf). Alcoves numbered 
21, 22, ete., along one side of room and then back along the other to 
40; then 41 is the alcove above 21 and so round on the second floor, 
while the third floor begins with 61 above 41, and so on. Hence, regu- 
lar sequence of alcoves, both perpendicularly and horizontally. To 
designate the shelf four figures are used, thus: in 2675 the figures 26 
stand for aleove, 7 for range, and 5 for shelf. To this shelf number is 
affixed the number of the book (work, not volume) on the shelf, 3852.17 
being the seventeenth book on second shelf of fifth range of alcove 38. 
A volume in a set is.indicated by adding its number (date, if a serial) 
to book number, thus 7537.10.2 or *3115.1 (1877). Books marked * can

only be taken out of building by permission of officer in charge; ** can 
not circulate; *** permission of trustees required. System devised 
by the late Nathaniel B. Shurtleff [see Reference list at end of this 
chapter], and details carried out by the late Prof. C:C. Jewett. One 
er more alcoves are assigned to each of eighteen grand divisions of 
subjects, and in each alcove ranges are assigned to certain subdivisions. 
Public denied access to shelves. Dictionary catalog has no relation 
to shelf classification. The idea of reclassifying has never been enter- 
tained for a moment, so no examination of other systems has ever 
been made. (Theodore F. Dwight, Lib’n.) 
Harvard University. About one-third of the books are classified, 
filling the present stack; when new stack is finished the rest will be 
classified. Many subjects are taken out of the general classification, 
when well rounded as collections, and form independent groups, e. g., 
classics, angling literature, Dante, ete. (Justin Winsor, Lib’n.) 
University of Chicago.—Began to apply Dewey system two years 
ago. Delighted with it. Modifies biography only. (Zella Allen Dix- 
son, Ass’t Lib’n.) 
. Astor.—In 1854 Dr. Cogswell adopted Brunet’s system with five 
main divisions; subsequently the main divisions were reduced to four: 
Literature and art (six subdivisions), history (six subdivisions), science 
(seven subdivisions), philosophy (seven subdivisions). Subdivisions 
can not be absolute, but depend much on practical convenience and free 
growth of different branches of learning. (Frederick Saunders, Lib’n.) 
New York Mercantile.—‘‘Standard literature” is arranged on the 
shelves alphabetically by authors’ names. Different works by same 
author are alphabeted under his name by titles. Fiction is separated 
from standard books and alphabeted by titles regardless of author. 
No shelf marks nor class numbers. Only number used is accession 
number, stamped on title-page. Thus far the system has worked very 
well. Has its drawbacks, as all others have, but knowing the vast 
labor and expense of reclassifying, little thought has been given to 
new methods. It costs less than some others, and books can be dis- 
tributed more quickly by it. (W.'T. Peoples, Lib’n.) 
Yale University.—Applying a new classification. Main classes 
marked by letters, and smaller divisions by figures; e. g., history (other 
than American) is B, Italian history is Bm, periods and local divisions 
of Italian history are Bm 1 to Bm 99. Sometimes a third letter is added 
for rough alphabeting, thus: Be, American genealogy (collective); Beb, 
American families beginnning with B. (Genealogy is treated as one 
of the prolegomena in B, and as American genealogy can not well 
be separated from English, it comes in B instead of with American 
history in ©.) Has found Hartwig’s Halle Schema most helpful, but 
departs widely from it. Cutter notation too complicated. (Addison 
Van Name, Lib’n.) 
Sutro.—Books unclassified, Will probably be shelved on fixed loca- 
tion principle, under a classification based on the Halle Schema, with

some modifications from the Perkins classification, Eleven main classes, 
Details of class marks, book numbers, ete.; not yet fixed. Every grow- 
ing library needs abundance of empty shelving. (Geo. Moss, Actg 
Lin.) 
Chicago Public.—System devised by Dr. Wm.F. Poole. [See Refer-

Library crowded, and embarrassed by fixed location on shelves. If any 
change were made, would probably use Dewey. (A.W. Whelpley, Lib’n.) 
Library Co. of Philadelphia.—If any changes were made, would be 
mere matters of detail, not of principle involved in the Smith system. 
(Geo. Maurice Abbot, Asst. Lib’n.) 
Boston Athenzeeum.—Law and medicine still unclassified. Close 
classification favored, at least for books much used at shelves. Mne- 
monic notation ‘does not cost much in our case, and is rather conve- 
nient.” (Wm. C. Lane, Lib’n.) 
New York State.—Would modify Dewey system by transposing 
classes 4 and 9, so as to bring sociology and history, philology and lit- 
erature, together. ‘“‘We should also make some minor changes if it 
were possible to start anew; but itis clearly vastly better to use as now 
than to sacrifice the great gain that comes from using a system in 
common with several hundred libraries.” (Melvil Dewey, Director.) 
Philadelphia Mercantile.— Would make no change in the Edmands, 
if it were to be made over again, except to subdivide further, Decimal 
system is artificial and unnatural. Dewey and Cutter notations are 
wasteful and too complicated. (John Edmands, Liv’1.) 
Columbia College.—Modified Dewey classification used in larger 
part of library, but some sections have classifications better suited to 
their character. Biography in one alphabet, literatures of individual 
peoples sometimes in one alphabet, sometimes in 3 or 4 period sub- 
divisions. Many classes in later editions of Dewey are not used. If 
starting in to apply it, or make it over again, would use a much more 
limited number of classes. If classifying this library anew would 
group: as far as possible by departments of instruction. Would dis- 
card any classification based on ideal or subjective grouping of all 
human knowledge, but would arrange books as the various depart: 
ments of the university found it desirable to use them. Favor close 
classification as far as clearly defined, unmistakable, and generally 
recognized classes of books can be created. Do not think any library 
justified in any great extra expense in classification. Any attempt in 
a large library to make classification a substitute for the catalog as 
an index to the contents of the library must be unsuccessful. On the 
other hand, books which are like each other and unlike other books 
may as well be kept together. Mnemonic notation in a large library is 
of very little importance; is of no account to the reader. In reality 
 
-P-A-G-E-882
    872 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
the Dewey notation has no mnemonic elements. Uniformity of coun- 
try subdivisions and notation is useful. In a library that is not grow- 
ing, close classification requires somewhat more space than broad. In 
a library rapidly growing, space should be left as generally dispersed as 
possible. No material waste is caused by closed classification. (Geo. 
H. Baker, Lib’n.) 
Cornell University.—System similar to that of the British Museum 
[see Reference list]. Numbers 1-10,000 taken, each number represent- 
ing a press, or, if need be, a vertical section including two or more 
presses. Each shelf denoted by a letter. Numbers (presses) assigned 
as follows: 1-100, reading room; 101-1000, philology, oriental and 
classical literature; 1001-3000, modern literature; 3001-6000, history; 
6001-7000, social and political science; 7001-7400, philosophy; 7401- 
7700, religion; 7701-8000 fine arts and architecture; 8001-8325, indus- 
trial arts and engineering; 8326-9050, general and physical science, and 
geology; 9051-10000, natural history, agriculture, and medicine. [The 
law library is in another building, and has a classification of its own.] 
In practice large gaps are left in numbering, e. g., press 3476 is.now fol- 
lowed by press 3491. So, on the shelves, 100 numbers are assigned to 
each shelf, and similar gaps are left in the shelf numbers. The form of 
the book number is 2967 D 19. At present Power’s Handy Book About 
Books, 2978 A 20, is followed on the shelf by Rouveyre’s Connaissances 
Nécessaires, etc., 2978 A 31-32. In the case of serials a number is given 
to a group, and each serial receives a letter, e. g., Library Journal, 2975 
A. ‘The present method seems to work fairly well, and I know of no 
perfect system as yet evolved.” Do not favor very close classification, 
but would be governed by circumstances in each case. (Geo. Wm. 
Harris, Lib’n.) 
Enoch Pratt.—System based on Poole’s Chicago public library, 
divided into 26 grand classes designated by letters. In each class the 
numbers from 1 to 10000 are assigned to subdivisions according to 
which the books are shelf-listed. The first 10,000 being filled, the num- 
bers from 1000 te 20000 are in like manner subdivided, etc.; ¢.g., works 
in modern languages being HE, German books are to E 1 to 5000 and 
_E 15,000 to 30000; French books, E 5000 to 15000; Spanish books, 
E 30000 to 40000; Portuguese book, E 40000 to 41000; Italian books, 
E 50000 to 60000. Not an ideal system, but too much trouble to change. 
Prefer a more expansible one. (Bernard C. Steiner, Lib’n.) 
Brooklyn.—Library divided into 44 main classes, numbered 1 to 83, 
some classes having two or three numbers, according to extent, as theol- 
ogy, 35-37. The 44 classes include about 400 subclasses. In other 
classes than fiction the shelf mark is made up of class number + shelf + 
range+ book. Thus, 411.01 means 4 class No. (history), 1 first shelf, of 
range 1, 01 being first book on the shelf. The books on a given shelf 
are numbered from 01 to 99, leaving blank numbers for interpolations. 
In fiction each author has a number, with 5 or 10 spaces of five lines
-P-A-G-E-883
  THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 873 
each left between each author for new entries, giving room enough for 
all additions for next 20 or 30 years, and keeping the arrangement 
alphabetic. Local significance of shelf number is a great help in finding 
a book. Generally close classification is desirable, but not as a substi- 
tute for subject catalog. (W. A. Bardwell, Lib’n.) 
Detroit Public.—Dewey modified in detail, but not in principle. 
Would not recommend these changes to others, nor any radical depar- 
ture from Dewey system. Mnemonic feature of notation affords aid and 
symmetry; has yet to learn that it sacrifices anything that would be 
more helpful to the practical classifier under the system. (H. M. Utley, 
TAbn.) 
Peabody Institute, Baltimore.—System devised by Rev. John G. 
Morris and P. R. Uhler in 1861. Seven main classes subdivided as 
required. Not arranged by decimal system “or any other iron-clad 
method.” Each volume marked for floor, alcove, case, and shelf, thus: 
1345, meaning floor 1, aleove 3, case 4, shelf 5, of west side of hall. 
Books shelved on east side of room have similar marks, but with a minus 
sign prefixed. Cases in alcoves are numbered 1, 2, 3, ete., upto 0. Each 
subject extends from below upwards through the different floors or 
tiers. No change is contemplated or desired, other than minor ones to 
suit new conditions. (Philip R. Uhler, Lib’n.) 
Newberry.—Poole method [see References]. Expands, subdivides, 
and makes new classes, as the library increases, but does not modify the 
system in any other respect. ‘It has always seemed to me that there 
was a natural way of classifying a library which is self-evident to a 
practical man who will do his own thinking. It is so simple that it 
hardly needs an explanation. New attendants, readers, and the publie 
at large take in its meaning at once. I regard the time and ingenuity 
spent in devising artificial systems of classification and mnemonic 
notations as wasted energy, and I have long since ceased to give them 
any attention. I have never read ‘the first three figures of the Dewey,’ 
and do not care to; and do not know what ‘the first two letters of the 
Cutter’ are. Ido not think the mnemonic element of any value, and 
will have none of itin mine. What I understand as ‘close-classifica- 
tion’ I regard as a useless fad, or something worse.” (Wm. F. Poole, 
Tib’n.) 
University of Pennsylvania.—Dewey, modified considerably. Re- 
ligion and philosophy almost entirely changed. Discard the form of 
divisions in the various literatures, except American and English, 
and reject the period divisions in all. Also many minor changes in 
subdivisions in all classes. If beginning anew, would use the same, 
with still larger modifications of Dewey. (Gregory B. Keen, Lib’n.) 
U.S. Surgeon General’s Office.—Books alphabeted by authors, as 
far as possible, under each of a number of grand divisions, ¢.g., anatomy, 
physiology, medicine, surgery, gynecology and obstetrics, jurispru- 
dence, ophthalmology, hygiene, ete. Journals and transactions alpha- 
   
-P-A-G-E-884

beted by countries. Pamphlets alphabetic in numbered boxes. Books 
numbered in one series. No access to shelves. Index catalogue takes 
place of classification thus far, If classifying anew would divide 
library into about 80 classes and arrange books alphabetically in each 
elass. (John 8. Billings, Lib’n.) 
Pennsylvania State.—Would use a modified Dewey plan. Not 
wedded to any particular system. (Wm. H. Egle, Lib’n.) 
General Society of Mechanics and Tradesmen “ Apprentices”). 
—If changing the present» [Schwartz] system would arrange books 
according to following scheme of classes: 
Fiction. 
Biography. 
History and geography. 
Political and social science. 
Philosophy and theology. 
Natural science. 
Useful and fine arts. 
Language and literature. 
Foreign literature (in other languages than English). 
Polygraphy. SCaHANIAgtrKwWNHH 
By beginning with fiction (class 0) one number is saved, as the 0 is 
‘not written but understood. Two hundred and fifty thousand separate 
works can be numbered by using only five symbols. Would divide 
these departments into 1,000 sections, and these would be so arranged 
that they would form an endless chain. It would then be immaterial 
where the classification began. Polygraphy would have as its last 
division juvenile literature, ending with juvenile fiction, thus connecting 
with class 0, fiction. 
If making a new classification, would arrange under 1,000 sections 
in which the subject classes (Nos. 2,3, 4, 5, 6, of above scheme) would 
have one section each, but the form classes (Nos. 0, 1, 7, 8, 9) would 
have not less than 10 nor more than 100 sections each (thus poetry 
would have 10 sections, biography and fiction 100 each, drama 10, essays 
10). “The error that all the current schemes make is to multiply 
numbers in the most popular classes.” Instead of an author-table to 
number individual books-in the subject classes, would simply use the 
initial of the author, followed by 1, 2,3, ete. Butin the form classes 
the A, B, etc., would not stand for initial of author, but for a subdivi- 
sion of one of the sections. Thus, if poetry has sections 570 to 579, 
then 571 might stand for authors whose initials are A and B, 578 for S 
and T, and 578 B for Shakspere, 578 Y for Thomson, and so on. Close 
classification wastes numbers, and therefore wastes time of readers 
and librarians. (Jacob Schwartz, Lil’n.)

THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 875 
Georgetown University.—Modifies Dewey by dividing theology 
intodogmaand moral. Where the Dewey decimal does not suffice, uses 
letters; e. g., Algonquin lang. is marked 497.1, and the 107 dialects are 
marked 497.1 A, ete. “‘ Dewey’s system has proved to be so satisfactory 
that it has not occurred to us that any change in our present order is 
desirable.” (J. F. X. Mulvaney, 8. J., Lib’n.) * 
Lehigh University.—Dewey, modified by alphabeting all individual 
biography in one series; no period divisions in literature; in United 
States local history and geography sectional subdivision stops with the 
States, all cities, towns, counties, etc., being alphabeted under State. 
(Wm. H. Chandler, Director.) 
Worcester Free Public.—Dewey in reference library (48,600 vol- 
umes), no classification in circulating library (42,400 volumes). More 
books with four and five figures than with three. Do not care for closer 
classification than this, (Samuel 8. Green, Lib’n.) 
American Antiquarian Society.—Library classified by subjects in 
aleoves. Books alphabeted on shelves by subjects, by authors, or 
chronologically. (Edmund M. Barton, Lib’n.) 
California State.--Recently reclassified on a scheme drawn up after 
eareful examination of Dewey, Perkins, Fletcher, and personal inspec- 
tion of several Eastern libraries. Works in general hbrary grouped in 
11 classes, subdivided to a degree determined by number of books in 
respective subdivisions. (W. D. Perkins, Lib’n.) 
College of New Jersey.—Reclassifying the whole library, using, as 
far as possible, the main divisions of the old system and same sequence, 
but with a movable location. Will probably use a 4-figure class num- 
ber, followed by a 2, 3, or 4 figure author number, with a third number 
for the book, thus: 3175.31.3. In this example the author number, 31, 
represents anything from Charles de Blois to Civerehio in a system 
which divides the biographie dictionary [Phillips’?] into about 9,000" 
parts and uses 2, 3, or 4 figures for author number according to size of ~ 
elass. English fiction, poetry, and some other classes haye special let- 
ter marks, letters and numbers 1-99 being reserved for special libraries 
or things taken out of logical order. Believe in close classification, but 
think the later editions of Dewey carry it altogether too far for praeti- 
eal use, though some of the sections should be expanded. (Hrnest C. 
Richardson, Lib’n.) 
St. Louis Public—W: T. Harris system, ‘‘on which the Dewey 
system is based,” expanded [see References}. If classifying anew, 
would revise present system, working in some of the subdivisions of 
the Dewey. In general, should use mnemonics only so far as ean be 
employed without straining and excessive artificiality. (Frederick M. 
Crunden, Lib’n.)

St. Louis Mercantile.—Applying Outter’s sixth, with additions from 
seventh as fast as it appears. Disregard Cutter notation in literature. 
purdivide (and mark) English literature as follows: 
Collected works. 
Poetry. 
Drama. 
Oratory. 
Essays. 
Wit and humor. 
Fiction. 
Juveniles [not used]. 
Folk literature. 
The principal modern literatures are marked with 2 figures, by adding 
one or other of the above nes to 1 for Italian, 2 for Spanish, 3 for 
Portuguese, 4 for French, 5 for Russian, 6 for Swedish, 7 for Dano- 
Norwegian, 8 for binion,: 9 for Dutch. Thus the mark for Italian 
poetry is 12, for German fiction itis 87, and soon. This is not confus- 
ing, as figures alone are not used in the Cutter notation, and it shortens 
marks for most-used books very materially. Letters (correspondence) 
go with biography, and so do criticisms of an author’s works. Uses a 
classification of its own for law. United States Government docu- 
ments are marked with 3 figures and 2 letters, thus: 422 H E = Forty- 
second Congress, second session, House Executive. If classifying 
anew, would use same scheme, still more modified as to notation; or an 
entirely new one if could spare the time to make it. Mnemonies 
responsible for most of the faults in Dewey, Cutter, and similar schemes.

University of Michigan.—Fixed location. ‘In our classification 
we bring together as closely as possible, on the shelves, matter on the

WHe 
‘same subject. * * * I consult Dewey’s, Edmands’s, and Perkins’s 
systems more frequently than others.” No separate class of biogra- 
phy; lives of men distributed according to subject with which they 
were identified. If classifying anew would use a movable system. (Ray- 
mond ©. Davis, Lib’n.) 
Wisconsin State Historical Society.—Books have no shelf num- 
bers, and consequently no definite classification. “We hope in the near 
future to be able to adopt and make use of the best system extant.” 
(Isaac 8. Bradley, Lib’n.) 
Brown University.—Introducing Cutter. Modify wherever re- 
quired by needs of a university library. Biographies placed with the 
subject they illustrate. Rhetoric with composition. (Harry L. Koop- 
man, Lib’n.) 
San Francisco Public.—See table. (John Vance Cheney, Lib’n.) 
Dartmouth College.—Tixed location, using + to mark north side of 
room, and — for south side. If changing, would have a limited num- 
ber of departments marked A, B, etc., subdivided by adding 1, 2, 3, 
etc., and an author mark similar to Cutter’s. (M. D. Bisbee, Lib'n.)

THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 877 
Cleveland Public.—Dewey, modified by arranging biography (indi- 
vidual), poetry, essays, novels, and stories for the young alphabetically, 
and by redistributing numbers in some classes. If beginning anew, 
would retain the alphabetic arrangement, but would not vary from 
Dewey in any other way, the convenience of shorter numbers and 
desirable readjustments being more than counterbalanced by incon- 
venience of departing from the printed form. Carry the Dewey out to 
6 or even 7 figures when necessary, and think it pays. (Wm. H. Brett, 
Lib’n.) 
Buffalo.—Dewey, modified in detail but not in principle. Prefer an 
eclectic system. Favor close classification to a certain extent, dependent — 
on size and character of library and of the various classes. Mnemonics 
useful within limits, but not when applied as a system throughout. 
J. N. Larned, Supt.) 
United States Senate.—See table. (Alonzo W. Church, Lib’n.) 
Union Theological Seminary.—Classification based upon divisions 
in Hagenbach’s Theologische Encyklopidie. Added to these are other 
divisions for the non-theological books, which are arranged largely 
according to frequency of use. San Francisco Theological Seminary 
library arranged in same manner. ‘TI consider a ‘close’ classification a 
delusion and a snare, as it is not the practice of men to write many books 
which lend themselves to it. * * * Even such ‘close’ classification 
as I have carried out wastes space, and ultimately leads to confusion.” 
(Chas. R. Gillett, Lib’n.) 
Milwaukee Public.—Except as to fiction, Dewey system not greatly 
modified. Scheme as used is printed in catalog of 1885. Changes 
from original are almost entirely those made for Buffalo library. Would 
change biography entirely, probably alphabeting all individual lives: 
in one series. [Jf classifying anew?] “This question I could only 
answer after the most careful thought and comparison, and then in fear 
and trembling, if the necessity came. We are bound to the Dewey 
classification, and any ideas of change are playthings merely. We 
feel the pinches of the Dewey scheme, but I might hesitate to change 
on the principle of the first swarm of flies and the fox. I admire the 
new Cutter expansive classification. It, naturally, solves many of the 
Dewey problems; but I think the mixed letters aud numbers of the 
notation an objection. It is comparatively simple for attendants to 
learn any scheme, but the general public is troubled by a hieroglyphic- 
looking book number. I think the general tendency is to underrate 
this difficulty.” [Close classification?] ‘Decidedly, yes. If the dream 
of access of borrowers to the shelves ever is realized, I think the shelf 
classification will be even more important than now. My only abjec- 
tion is the more complicated notation required.” [Mnemonics?| All 
other things being equal, the mnemonic element is sometimes a con- 
venience. It hardly seems worth much sacrifice, however. (Theresa

San Francisco Mercantile.—Dewey, with Cutter author marks. 
“Have no changes to suggest, inasmuch as both systems seem to suit 
our purpose admirably.” Uses 3 figures of Dewey. ‘For special 
libraries would think a closer classification indispensable.” (H. R. 
Coleman, Lib’n.) 
Minneapolis Public.—Did not modify Edmands in principle, but 
reduced it by combining many subclasses and changing author nota- 
tion from 10,000 to 1,000. Regret this change. ‘Those who have not 
used close classification sooner or later need to do it, and the seventh 
classification of Mr. Cutter seems none too close.” (James K. Hosmer, 
Liv’n.) 
Providence Public.— Use a decimal system strongly resembling the 
Dewey in notation. “It is not the Dewey system; but this is simply 
owing to the fact that some system had to be adepted before the Dewey 
system had been so fully developed as it is at present. If I were start- 
ing anew, I should not hesitate to take the Dewey system as it now 
stands. I favor the opportunity of being able to use a ‘closer’ classi- 
fication than ‘the first 3 figures,’ on occasion. As a matter of faet, we 
seldom go beyond 4 figures.” [See Mr. Foster’s paper in L. j.15: © 6-9.]

Essex Institute.—See table. (Chas. 8. Osgood, Lib’n.) 
Amherst College.—‘‘ Dewey system was employed here first, in 
1874,andremains. The scheme is modified constantly, mainly by divid- 
ing or combining classes, and, in doing so, disregarding the decimal 
plan and the Dewey notation. We classify various departments of the 
library with respect to their special needs, and have no special refer- 
ence to the scheme as a whole in making these changes.” If classi- 
fying anew would use “In the main, that outlined by me in J. j. 14.” 
Fayor close classification, ‘but in general would make classes no more 
minute than Dewey 3-figure classes, and make further subdivisions by 
blocking off book numbers.” Do not think mnemonic notations worth 
their cost, “but have not given the matter enough attention to speak 
positively.” (Wm. I. Fletcher, Lib’n.) 
Young Men’s Mercantile, Cincinnati—Biography alphabeted by 
subjects; miscellany, history, travels, fine arts, poetry, science, etc., 
alphabeted by authors. Noshelf numbers. ‘As I have but two assist- 
ants, we put away every morning the books brought in the day before, 
and, as we have to classify them to put them in their proper divisions, a 
knowledge of the contents of every book must be had. In that way we

for; we can get what is wanted without reference to the catalog. “Phe. 
systems of numbering on the outside of the book [ object to as prac- 
tically debarring librarians from what they should know, i. @, the

ined many systems, but find none that I would use.” (John M. Newton,

Hartford Theological Seminary.—(Case Memorial).—Applying a 
system prepared for specialized theological library, with 26 general

If changing would put biography before history. “TI think that, as 
in building a house, so in making a classification, it needs about three 
trials to make a success. In my opinion Cutter has done the best work 
in classification of any whose work I have seen.” (A. 'T. Perry, Lib’n.) 
Indianapolis Public.—Library divided into twenty-three main 
classes, A-Z. Fiction and juveniles arranged alphabetically by authors; 
other classes, by subjects. Books (separate works) in each elass num- 
bered from 1 upwards, as A 1-A 750. Numbers plentifully skipped to 
leave room for new books. In case of a block, another letter is added; 
e.g., A 600, A 601, AA 601, AB 601, A602. Same system used in Omaha

dred subdivisions, takes the place of 974.1, and includes special collec- 
tion on Maine. If the system were to be made over, would demand 
more room for English history, a better place for constitutional history, 
and an entire recasting of Greek and Latin literature. “In general, I 
should ask to have the classes fit the books rather than the system, 
and leave occasional places for a new subject. * * * We do not, 
however, intend to break away in any important particular from the 
Dewey system. * * * [If classifying anew?] I can not answer

        882 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
“Convenience of bench and bar determines classification cf a law library. 
Lawyers must have access to shelves, and they greatly prefer to help 
themselves to the books wanted. Hence the classification should be 
as simple and compact as possible. A lawyer finds it much easier to 
run down the alphabet through a collection of 2,000 volumes of treatises. 
to find the volume wanted than to have the same collection divided into 
100 lots representing as many subjects. In the latter case, he has first 
to find the subject, and second to find the volume. It is seldom that a : 
lawyer wishes to see all or any considerable number of the works con- 
tained in the library. His inquiry usually is for the latest and best 
work on the topic he is interested in, From an experience of twenty- 
five years as librarian of this library, I am able to say that the method 
of classification outlined [above] * * * has given the very best 
satisfaction. (Stephen B. Griswold, Lib’n.) 
Lynn Public.—Classification includes nineteen main classes and 
marked by initial of subject, or other letter, subdivided by adding a 
second letter, and still further, if desired, by figures. “ My plan was 
adopted after studying all the methods then [1878] in use. It has given. 
good satisfaction; but if I were called to arrange a new library I should 
make a study of all methods now in use. I am favorably impressed 
with the Cutter system. I do not favor very close classification for 
libraries of ordinary size.” (J.C. Houghton, Lib’n.) 
University of Vermont.—Dewey. Biography alphabeted; lives of 
authors with their works. (H. A. P. Torrey, Lib’n.) 
Illinois State.—Rough topical groupings. Memory of librarian the 
only guide in finding books. (W. H. Hinrichsen, Sec. of State and ea 
off. Lil’n.) : : 
Omaha Public.—See table. (Jessie Allan, Lib’n.) 
Peoria Public.—See table. (E. 8S. Willcox, Lib’n.) 
Iowa State.—Sce table. (Mrs. Mary H. Miller, Lib’n.) 
Wellesley College.—Dewey. Would change sequence of classes, 
bringing history and sociology on succeeding numbers; so also litera- 
ture and language, and biography with history. (Lydia B. Godfrey, 
Tib'n.) 
Sage Library. (Theol. Sem., New Brunswick, N. J.).—Uses “ a com: 
mon sense, illogical, unconcatenated, unrelated, unnumbered, unclas- 
sified classification. Consult an encyclopedia and put coal under coal, 
and don’t try to reason out that it belongs in the same category with 
diamonds or pigiron. The public won’t reason your way. Put it down 
arbitrarily coal,and letit go. It is worth while classifying some related 
subjects, but it is not worth while to show the logie of the classitica- 
tion to any great extent. On the shelf, or in the alcove or department, 
put all the fine arts together, poetry, painting, sculpture, architecture, 
drama. Put engraved gems there, too, but don’t insist on it that it is 
a part of seulpture—a division, or a subdivision. Let it stand appar- 
ently unrelated. * * * Weclassify our books in alcoves, referring 
 
-P-A-G-E-893
  THE WORLD'S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 883 
in catalog to the alcove, right or left side of it. When in the aleove 
the shelf tags do the rest. No numbers on the books, which are alpha- 
beted by author, under subject.. This would probably not work well 
in a large public library, but in a small scholars’ library like this it 
does very well. We have too many rare and handsomely bound books 
to plaster them over with labels or stamped numbers. The great still- 
hunt of library science at present seems to be after finding a book on 
the shelf. As to whether it is worth a rap after it is found, your aver- 
age librarian does not concern himself; yet that is just the most impor- 
tant part of his business. He should guide to the best books and tell 
the reader what he needs. If librarians knew more about the value of ~ 
books and less about their nwmber, the public would be better for it. 
Of course this is an old fogy idea. I got it from an old fogy in the 
British Museum many yearsago. His name is Richard Garnett—bless 
him! * * * Tbelieve in many subjects unclassified. Two books on 
suicide should have a subject division of suicide, but should not figure 
under the chief head of medicine, social science, or anything of that 
sort. I don’t believe in any system that presupposes knowledge or 
ability or insight in the reader. The average reader is a dunce and 
neither knows nor cares anything about systems. Further, I don’t 
believe in making an obscure science out of a few plain facts. Make 
everything as plain as a barn door.” (John C, Van Dyke, Lib’n.) 
Maine State.—Dewey. Classification of law modified and enlarged. 
Dewey classification of law very defective; that of history nearly per- 
fect. Recommends bringing form divisions of literature (as fiction) 
together and subdividing by languages, instead of the reverse. Will 
use Outter’s author table. “Some of his [Dewey’s] great classes are 
not clearly defined and entirely logical in arrangement. Nevertheless, 
it seems to me that Dewey’s work is the best I haveseen. Some of our 
librarians have run nearly mad on the subject of classification, and 
have rendered life a burden to those who attempted to carry out fully 
their theoretical classification. The simplest form is best, in this as in 
everything else intended for real help and use.” (LL. D. Carver, Lib’n.) 
Syracuse University.—Uses provisionally a fixed location, but 
books are so arranged that, as far as possible, the initial of the subject 
division corresponds with the letter of stack section. “ The intention 
is to have a relative system eventually. From what I have seen of the 
several systems I think that none now in use will be absolutely adopted, 
but a modification of some one of them, ora new one entirely.” (Henry 
O. Sibley, Lib’n.) 
New York Y. M. C. A—Dewey. Changes suggested; index en- 
larged. History, travels, biography, too crowded; medicine under 
science; amusements under sociology. [If beginning anew?] “I think 
I should adopt the same system; I, however, might use Mr. Noyes’ 
(Brooklyn) admirable system after a more thorough study of it.”

  New York Bar Association.—Reports and statute law, arranged 
by countries and States. Text-books, ete., alphabetically by authors. 
(Wm. J. C. Berry, Lib’n.) 
Philadelphia Athenzum.—See table. (Louis K. Lewis, Lib’n.) 
Wesleyan University.—See table. (Wm. J. James, Lib’n.) 
Woodstock College.—Library largely theological. Theology in 10 
divisions, of which, e. g., seriptura sacra subdivided into Biblia (Latina, 
Greca, etc.), Introductio, Vindicie Cathol., Philolog. Biblica, Concor- 
dantiz, Comment. Cathol., Comment. Acathol., Tractatus Varii, ete. 
Fixed location. “Were I to begin the arrangement of the library anew 
I should follow the same method. * * * For practical purposes it 
matters very little whether I find a book according fo the decimal sys- 
tem or any other. In my opinion classification should depend entirely 
on the particular library, on the room, and the number of beoks to be 
placed.” (A. J. Maas, Lib’n.) 
Newark Public.—Dewey, unimportant modifications. Sometimes 
earries classification to 5 figures, but “for small libraries should say 
most decidedly not closer than 3 of Dewey.” (Frank P. ill, Lib’n.) 
Cambridge Public.—Cutter classification. Moved into new build- 
ing just after issuing a new catalog, and could not change notation, 
which was that of the Boston Public, now used to indicate movable 
location. ‘ Were I to start anew I should choose between Cutter’s and 
Dewey’s systems; should prefer the former, only the introduction of 
letters very much increases the probability of mistakes on the part 
of the public. * * * T have arranged my reference library by the 
Dewey system and like it for that. I should not use either for a small 
library—say less than 10,000 volumes.” (Almira L. Hayward, Lib’n.) 
Franklin Institute.—Broad classification, fixed location. Would 
use Dewey, with Cutter’s author table, classifying as closely as possible. 
(Alfred Rigling, Lib’n.) 
Hartford Public.—Dewey, with modifications, partly Fletcher's. 
English fiction, biography, poetry, arranged alphabetically. French, 
German, juveniles, by themselves, classified. (Miss C. M. Hewins, 
TAl’n.) 
Oberlin College.—Dewey, modified. In the classics and Shakspere 
all translations, biographies, criticisms, ete., go with author’s works, 
With these exceptions the Dewey author marks in literature are dis- 
regarded, and alphabetic arrangement used, as also in biography. 
Periodicals indexed in Poole, arranged alphabetically by themselves, 
no class number; so also reference books. United States documents 
have a classification and notation of their own. Changes suggested: 
Combine philosophy and religion under class 1; combine 110 and 120 
with their subdivisions; put 178 under sociology. Define more accu- 
rately 210 and subdivisions, and their relations to 239 and subdivisions; 
entirely rewrite 230, especially 231 and 233, which are very unsatisfac- 
tory; rewrite 262, bringing all prayer under 264, and therefore change
-P-A-G-E-895
  THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 885 
main divisions. Under class 300, rewrite 321 and 328, putting 328 
somewhere under 350, all of which should be rewritten with reference 
to books and not to theoretical division. Class 570 is unsatisfactory. 
Should forego advantages of 0 in 900-909, putting geography and 
travel under 900-909, biography 910-920, and what is now 900-910 
under 920-930, “Though from standpoint of classification I like some 
parts of Cutter much better, still the simplicity of the Dewey call num- 
bers, or, rather, the ease with which the average student can use them 
after a short period, is too great an advantage to give up.” (A.S. 
Root, Lib’n.) 
Pratt Institute.—Dewey, carried out to 3 figures only, save in a few 
classes. Does not favor closer classification except for libraries of 
60,000 volumes and upwards. (Mary W. Plummer, Lib’n.) 
Portland (Me.) Public.—See table. (Alice C. Furbish, Act’g Lib’n.) 
Newton Public.—Fixed location, except for periodicals. Library 
divided into 10 classes. Example of notation: 51.430 = class 5, shelf 1, 
430th work. (Elizabeth P. Thurston, Lib’n.) 
Massachusetts Historical Society.—See table. (Samuel A. Green, 
LAb’n.) 
Redwood, Newport.—Cutter’s Atheneum, occasionally modified by 
transposing subdivisions, as in sociology. ‘As I have worked for sev- 
eral years with Mr, C, in elaborating his classification, I feel sufficiently 
familiar with it to be able to make the changes without confusion.” 
Prefer Cutter’s sixth. [Mnemonic notations worth their cost?] “By no 
means !!_ Except for some few grand divisions, I have little faith in the 
mnemonic element.” (Richard Bliss, Lib’n.) 
Taunton Public.—Awaiting removal into larger building before 
introducing new classification on the shelves. (E. C. Arnold, Lib’n.) 
United States Military Academy.—See table. (Lieut. Sedgwick 
Pratt, Lib’n.) 
Manchester City.—Cutter classification in catalog. Books num- 
bered consecutively on shelves. No class marks. Would use Cutter. 
(Mrs. M. J. Buncher, .Lib’n.) 
Hamilton College.—See table. (Melvin G. Dodge, Lib’n.) 
Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences.—Library devoted 
exclusively to natural sciences; divided into two sections: (1) Periodi- 
cals, etc., arranged geographically, and (2) monographs, subdivided 
under 18 heads. Books numbered consecutively under each depart- 
ment. ‘The desirability of a closer classification in some of the depart- 
ments * * * is evident, but not pressing. Practically the arrangement 
works very well, the fixed location of each book being of advantage.” If 
changing, would probably use Dewey, with modifications. (Edw. J. 
Nolan, Lib’n.) 
Bangor Public.—See table. (Mary H. Curran, Lib’n.) 
Jersey City Public.—Dewey, with Cutter author numbers. “I 
would carry out the classification to one or two decimals in all cases 
     
-P-A-G-E-896
      886 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
where subdivisions are called for were I to start anew. In the Cutter 
numbers I would also use the table extended to three figures instead of 
the one using only two. The main difficulty we have is in getting the 
books back on their shelvesin their correct order with the help we em- 
ploy—girls from 14 to 16 years of age. The combination of figures and 
letters seems to puzzle them, and requires more care than if only figures 
or letters were used separately. If some author table like Edmands’s, 
composed entirely of figures, were carefully worked out and had proved 
satisfactory in its appheation, I am not sure but that with the class of 
help employed in this library it would work more satisfactorily than the 
Cutter tables.” * * * “The mnemonic clement is certainly very 
valuable after the system is in practice.” (Geo. Watson Cole, Lid’n.) 
Peabody Institute, Peabody, Mass.—Cutter. ‘As we shall not 
change anything at present, it is unnecessary for me to venture an 
opinion [as to choosing anew]. Probably in five years some of the 
present systems * * * will be changed for something simpier and 
more economical.” (J. Warren Upton, Lib’n.) 
Toledo Public.—Dewey, modified. Recommends “ greater simplic- 
ity, not so close classification. The excess in numbers added is often 
perplexing to those going for books in a hurry.” (Mrs. Frances D. Jer- 
main, Lib’n.) 
Lawrence (Mass.) Public.—“In a library where the public do not 
have access to the shelves a close classification is not of much impor- 
tance. If the assistants can find the books readily that is all that is nee- 
essary. The fewer letters and numbers borrowers have to write on the 
call slips the better they are suited, and the less likely are they to make 
mistakes. All frequenters of the library have access to classed cata- 
logs, and can find books treating of any particular subject.” (Frederi¢ 
H. Hedge, Lib'n.) 
United States Naval Academy.—Ten main classes, A-I, with 
subdivisions, 1-50, etc. Would prefer “some system with more than 
10 classes.” (A. N. Brown, Lib’n.) 
- Dayton Public.—Twenty main classes, subdivided as convenient. 
“Trom the experience which we have had, taking into consideration 
the size of library, present rate of growth, character of help employed, 
promptness of service, etc., we would use the same principle of classifi- 
cation [if beginning anew], only applied in greater detail, and carried 
out to its last consequences.’ The result would be an arrangement 
much like that of the Congressional Library or the Peabody Institute 
(Baltimore).” (Miss Minta I. Dryden, Lib’n.) 
Kansas State.—Smith, with additions, Would use Dewey— “so 
says ny cataloger.” (H. J. Dennis, Lib’n.) 
San Francisco Law.—Legal text-books arranged alphabetically; 
American reports alphabetically by States; English reports alphabet- 
ically as cited; United States, State, and foreign statutes same arrange- 
ment; legal periodicals follow same plan. No class marks. (Not 
signed.)

the classes represented by a letter (a numeral would do equally as good) 
and the individuals by a number. This is still in use, unmodified.” 
[Mnemonics useful?] ‘No; I do not believe in burdening patrons with 
an unnecessary number of symbols. They mean nothing to them, and 
not much more to anyone else. The old-fashioned shelf number (say

somewhat after Perkins’s method. Expects to add largely to the latter, 
and will then reclassify, deciding upon a system after publication of 
this report. (D. A. Campbell, Liv’n.) 
St. Louis University.—Dewey. ‘The purposes of a public library, 
to be used by all classes of persons, and those of a learned institution 
being considerably divergent, I find that the mechanical application of 
the above [Dewey] system, which has already been made here, is defect- 
ive in many respects: (1) Because of the superfluity of classes for a 
purpose more or less specialized; (2) because of the unimportant local- 
ization assigned to the prime divisions, in the same premises. * * * 
[Cites examples in theology.] If there is any one of the above systems 
{mentioned in circular of inquiry] which would meet our requirements, 
Ishould be glad to adopt it. Otherwise [if changing] I would take sug- 
gestions from them and strike out on the above line [outlined].”. * * * 
(Thos. Hughes, S. J., Lib’n.) ; 
Troy Young Men's Association.—Fixed. Alphabeted under afew 
general divisions. ‘I believe that the most simple arrangement and 
classification of books is, under any and all circumstances, the best 
metliod. Close classification destroys chances for memorizing place, 
contents of volume, and general usefulness, is costly, and of no real 
value.” (DeWitt Clinton, Lib’n.) 
University of Minnesota——By departments of instruction. No 
class marks. When moving into new building will carefully consider 
plans of classification and shelving. Classification in subject catalog 
based upon Poole’s Chicago Public; full outline submitted in MS, 
“For a college library of moderate size it seems to me that a rough 
classification according to the departments of instruction will be as 
useful as any.” (Wm. W. Folwell, Lib’n.) 
University of the South—Dewey. In literature follows Dewey 
only to third figure, and in biography to the fourth; Cutter marks there- 
after in each case; so also in 283; elsewhere, the 5-place Dewey. ‘If 
I had the work to begin again I should be content with three places 
for a library the size of ours.” (Benj. W. Wells, Lib’n.)  
-P-A-G-E-898
888 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  Los Angeles Public.—Dewey. Fiction and juveniles alphabetic, 
closely following Milwaukee notation. In music, “‘“where Dewey gives 
782.2 to a book on Wagnerian music, we would classify the music itself 
78.22, i. e., simply carry the third number over the decimal.” Bound 
magazines arranged alphabetically. United States public documents 
have a non-Dewey classification. If beginning again, would classify 
very closely. (Tessa lL. Kelso, Lib’n.) 
Newburyport Public.—[// classifying anew?] “This is a question 
I can not answer. The more I study the various schemes, the harder 
I find it to come to a decision; but, on the whole, I rather favor the 
Dewey system, modified to meet my particular case, but I have no 
desire to establish a museum of minute classification.” (John D. 
Parsons, Lib’n.) ¢ 
Elaverford College.—[ Would use?| “Probably a modification of 
Perkins. Lack of funds and hope of a new building have prevented 
revision. No system should be followed rigidly. Whatever gives most 
economy of space, clearness in detail, ease in finding a book, should be 
followed in accordance with circumstances. Dare to be inconsistent.” 
(Allen C. Thomas, Lib’n.) 
University of Wisconsin.—Within a year will probably adopt 
either Dewey or Cutter, with modifications. ‘Our present classifica- 
tion in its large divisions corresponds to departments of instruction in 
the university, and naturally and rightly, I must think, sins against 
any theoretical system of classification in some points.” (Walter M. 
Smith, Lib’n.) 
Massachusetts Institute. of Technology.—Dewey. ‘Have redi- 
vided 547, and have subdivided further a few of the divisions. There 
are many arrangements which are inconvenient for us, for example, the 
separation of 400 and 800, of 380 and 330, of 332 and 336, of 335 and 331. 
The principles of the system seem to me about as simple and easily 
learned as possible.” [Close classification?| “Yes; where access to 
the shelves is perfectly free the closest possible classification seems to 
me desirable.” (Clement W. Andrews, Lib’n.) 
Colby University.—Dewey in galleries; fixed location on ground 
floor (most-used books). Free access. No shelf numbers, -‘‘Am very 
well pleased with the [Dewey] system.” Often use 7 figures. Make 
no use of mnemonics. (Edward W. Hall, Lib’n.) 
University of Rochester.—‘‘ The Dewey system (4th ed.) is used in 
classifying new books and in a gradual reclassification of the older por- 
tion of the library. This was done last January, anew librarian having 
been appointed from the faculty of instruction, Being shown this blank 
upon its receipt, he turned it over to me to answer. His opinion of the 
Dewey system is more favorable, of our obsolescent system much less 
favorable, than those herein expressed.” A full outline of the old sys- 
tem is givenin MS. It has 42 main classes, with more or less subdivi- 
sion, the books being arranged under each according to a combined 
alphabetical-and-size table (1-1000) adapted from Schwartz. ‘In the.

details of the Dewey system I find what seem to me to be the disjunc- 
tion of similars and the conjunction of dissimilars, as well as the failure 
to give adequate treatment to some important subjects. * * * 
Personally, I think the obsolescent system, * * * with some further 
subdivision in the case of a few classes, is adequate to the purposes of 
a college library till it attains a much larger size than ours.” (H. K.

B fer individual biography, with Cutter number; 920 for collective biog- 
raphies in one series by authors. Suggested changes: A better coun- 
try arrangement; consolidation of philology and literature, giving room 
for better arrangement of travels. If beginning anew, would adopt 
Cutter’s sixth. “This seems to me about what is needed in the aver- 
age public library of 10,030 to 100,000 volumes. Nearly all the neces- 
sary subdivisions can be made with two letters, or one letter and two 
figures.” (Gardner M. Jones, Lib’n.)

a woman, and having very little experience, I do not fecl competent to 
make any suggestions. Each State inthe Union is given space and 
the books are arranged according to years. The members of the legis-

SUMMARY OF RETURNS. 
To put the results of this canvass into a ballot box and figure out 
exactly how many librarians favor this or the other method, would be 
most misleading, for several reasons. Other things being equal, the 
experience gathered in a library of 500,000 volumes is worth about ten

times as much, from the classifier’s standpoint, as that afforded by work- 
ing in one of 50,000 volumes. The answers to my queries are in some 
cases intended to apply to libraries generally, but most of the librarians 
have had only their own institutions in view, and, as these differ so 
widely from each other in scope and functions, it is certain that the 
same man might have answered differently if his experience had been 
confined to libraries of another class. Many of the officers reporting 
have given but slight attention to the methods introduced within the 
past few years, being satisfied with the systems bequeathed to them 
or finding it quite impracticable to change. Finally, many of the 
replies are indefinite, and a few are ambiguous. 
The only summary of results that I can glean from these returns is 
as follows: 
1 American librarians are substantially agreed that books should be 
classified on the shelves in the order of subjects treated rather than 
in that of accession, or chronologically, alphabetically, by size alone, or 
by any other criteria, leaving the subarrangement (under classes) to 
be determined by the requirements of each case. This is the only 
point in the problem of classification that can be considered settled. 
2 One-half of the libraries reporting, including most of the older 
and larger ones, use systems of their own. 
3 Of the printed schemes that have appeared within the past seven- 
teen years, the Dewey system, which is the oldest, is used wholly or 
partly in one-third of the libraries on our list. Mr. Cutter’s expansive 
system (not yet finished) is rapidly growing in favor. The others are 
little used. 
4 Most of the users of the printed schemes modify them more or less. 
The chief objections urged against the Dewey, Cutter, and similar sys- 
tems are that the classification is arbitrary, that it is bound up in its 
notation, and that the latter is too complicated or too long. 
5 A movable location is generally preferred to fixed shelf numbers, 
but some librarians of wide experience reject it. 
6 The tendency is strongly toward close classification, but it is 
warmly opposed by many. 
‘T Mnemonic notations are condemned by a majority of those express- 
ing an opinion, but in a considerable number of libraries such expe- 
dients are found useful. 
This is all that I have been able to make out of the mass of data sub- 
mitted to me. Librarians agree that books should be classified by 
subjects on the shelves as well as in catalogs, but they disagree as to 
how it should be done. Take, for example, the largest five libraries in 
America; no two of them use the same system, and their replies to the 
three fundamental questions in our table in each case stand as follows:

I conclude that the day of cooperative classifying is not yet, and 
that if such a project ever be realized it will only come through the 
work of a committee of experts, No one man is competent. : 
Granting that it would be practicable to parcel out the labor of 
devising a system for classifying books, so that each science and art 
would be subdivided by a specialist, the gain would be twofold : 
1 Each librarian would save the time and expense of devising a 
scheme of his own, or of patching up the antiquated one bequeathed 
to him; and 
2 A system prepared by such a body would give greater promise of 
permanence and general usefulness than any drawn up by the average 
librarian. 
It is evident that the same system can not be used in all kinds of 
libraries. Yet if we take any two university libraries, for example, or 
any two free popular libraries, it will be found that they differ from 
each other mostly in size or in degree of symmetry, but not in scope, 
nor in the character and wants of their users. I can see no good 
reason why all libraries of a given class might not use the same general 
method with mutual advantage. 
The principal reason why such a scheme has not been undertaken is 
elearly stated in Professor De Morgan’s objection to a classed catalog, 
that “it is more difficult to use than to make, being one man’s idea of 
the subdivision of knowledge.” 
No system for classifying books in large libraries can give general 
satisfaction unless it be based on something more durable than per- 
sonal taste. In order to be reasonably permanent and usable, the 
method adopted must be governed by some underlying principle of 
association which is commonly accepted by students in the different 
departments of knowledge. The question as to whether a uniform 
system of classification may be practicable for a given class of libraries, 
resolves itself into the question whether a method can be found which 
will be scientific rather than arbitrary. All schemes looking only to- 
present conveniences must soon result in that confusion which reigns 
in nearly all great libraries at the present day; a confusion which 
makes library service doubly expensive, and causes those irritating 
delays with which scholars the world over are but too familiar. 
But it is objected that no logical classification of books is possible, 
owing to these two facts: 
1 The same books may treat successively of many different things; 
that is to say, it may be of composite structure, or even a conglomerate. 
2 A book may discuss a problem involving many entirely diverse 
principles and branches of knowledge. Consequently our classes will 
necessarily overlap, and the boundary lines between them will be 
shadowy. d 
But precisely the same difficulties arise when we attempt to classify 
anything else whatsoever. There may be as many different classifica- 
   
-P-A-G-E-902
      892 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
tions of a thing as it has characteristics which may be measured 
against those of other things, and these various classifications may be 
equally logical, equally scientific. Three dimensions of space would 
not suffice to show for any one thing in nature all of the relationships 
that it bears to other things. Nothing of this sort has been attempted 
in any science, and it is unfair to criticise a classification of books on 
the ground that it does not bring all correlatives together. When we 
come to conglomerates, such as a volume of essays, or Burton’s “Anat- 
omy of Melancholy,” we must classify them just as a geologist classifies 
the conglomerate rocks, by form or locality, rather than by composition 
or structure. There is no greater difficulty in the one case than in the 
other. 
The boundary lines between our classes will often be vague and 
shadowy. But so they are in any classification. We do not even know 
where plant life stops and animal life begins; yet that does not prevent 
our having a science of botany and another of zoology. 
The object of a classification is to bring together things which are 
like and to separate things which are unlike. It is as easy to bring 
together books of similar scope as to bring together plants of similar 
type. If different types of plants can be arranged in a system which 
will show their relative development, so can the literature of plants be 
arranged with scientific method, and so can all literature. 
It is a singular fact that many schemes of classification are enslaved 
to their notations. The attempt to make out of the book number a 
structural formula, showing the dependence of classes by giving a sep- 
arate figure or letter to each stage of descent, invariably results in an 
irrational classification disfigured with long and cabalistic marks. The 
object of a notation is to enable us to find or replace a book with ease 
and certainty. Anything that interferes with this isa mistake. The 
scheme of classification should be made without any thought of a nota- 
tion, and numbers assigned to it afterwards, taking care to allow for 
the future growth of the various classes. 
By using a book number, which shall in no case be longer or more com- 
plicated than 1234az (in which the figures are read as integers, and 
the order of figures and letters is always the same), it is possible to 
mark 7,000,000 volumes so that each volume is identified as it would be 
by an accession number. Furthermore, such a number will indicate 
the exact relative position of each subject, author, work, translation, 
edition, volume, copy, in a collection of 7,000,000 volumes, in which 
the books are classified by subjects, on the movable plan, with the 
utmost possible “closeness,” and the numbers will not fetter the clas- 
sification in any respect whatever. 
This being true, it follows that if we start with an empty building 
and leta library grow up within it in the normal way, the same nota- 
tion will suffice for a collection of 700,000 volumes, on the supposition 
that the author of the classification made an average error of 90 per

cent in estimating the growth of every subdivision in his scheme. 
Thereafter, by adding characters, he could provide for interpolations at 
any point and to any extent. <A similar notation using nothing but 
figures would be quite practicable. In such a case it is not likely that 
a number longer than 1234.567 would ever be needed in any library, 
save a few of the great national collections, and this number would be 
read as it stands, the figures before the decimal point being integers. 
In order to attain this we have only to sacrifice the halfway struc- 
tural formula, with its attendant halfway mnemonicity.

Loan SYSTEMS. 
By Mary Wricutr PrumMer, Librarian Pratt Institute, Brooklyn. 
Definition.—The charging or loan system is that part of a library’s 
administration by which chiefly its communication with borrowers is 
carried on, The word loan applies to it because the books are lent, 
and the word charging because every library, no matter how small, with 
any pretense to method, has some way of keeping account of these 
loans. 
Requisites.—The characteristic of a loan system best appreciated 
by the public is the speed with which it can receive and deliver books, 
The trifling annoyance of having to wait a few minutes for a book will 
drive many persons away from a library, and to a certain extent from 
the habit of reading. It therefore behooves the library administrators 
to consider speed when planning their charging system. 
Another requisite is simplicity, not only because it implies speed and 
makes the work easier, but because it insures greater accuracy. The 
more complicated the system the greater the chance for error, 
The third thing to keep in mind is that the less the borrower’s part 
in the operation the better he likes the system, The library must be 
sure that it asks of him only the facts absolutely necessary to -fill his 
order, and that any red tape should be kept behind the desk. 
These three things, then, are essential, for it is certain that if there 
is more than one library in a place people will go to the one where they 
are most quickly waited on with the least trouble to themselves, and 
with the fewest mistakes. 
A library, even a free library, is a business institution, and must keep 
a record of its transactions. It would be as absurd to keep no accounts 
in order to please the people and send them away sooner as it would 
be to enter no charges against the customers of a shop. The tangle 
that its affairs would soon find themselves in would be infinitely more 
troublesome to the borrower than the short time spent in waiting while 
the library recorded a few essential facts. Itshould therefore be taken 
for granted, in deciding on a charging system, that the publie will be 
patient and reasonable if the library does not impose on it. 
The library, if it keeps pace with the rest of the world, must know 
what itis doing. It is easy enough to hand out books day after day 
without knowing or caring whether more people are reading than this 
time a year ago, whether the best books are really called for, what the 
prevailing taste of the reading community is, whether people are grad- 
ually accumulating private collections of books at the library’s expense, 
whether everyone is getting an equal chance at the popular books, 
where a book is that people keep calling for and that does not makeits 
appearance, and a dozen other things that will occur to every libra- 
rian as (letails that he must know in-order to be master of the situation. 
If libraries were conducted on the guesswork plan, librarianship would

deserve small pay and smaller honor, for an automaton could be con- 
structed that would take in and hand out books, and learned pigs have 
been taught to pick out numbers and letters. 
The charging system should, to a great extent, tell whether the 
library is really of use to the community, and in order to do this it 
must put the library in possession of certain statistics. The question 
is how to get these statistics at least cost of time and trouble to the 
public, with least expenditure of labor and least risk of error on the 
part of the library. 
Questions answered by charging systems,—In 1852 the librarian 
of the Milwaukee public library sent to the Library journal the fol- 
lowing list of 20 questions, answered by the charging system of that 
library. The questions in parentheses have been added in preparing 
this paper, in order to make these questions a basis for examination of 
various charging systems: 
( 1 Isa given book out? 
2 If out, who has it? 
3 When did he take it? 
4 When is it to be sent for as overdue? 
5 Has the book ever been out? 
6 How many times and when has the book been out? 
| 7 How many (and what) books were issued on a given day? 
7a (How many (and what) books are due on a given day ?) 
{ 8. How many (and what) books in cach ‘class were issued on a given day? 
9 How many (and what) books are now out, charged to borrowers? 
10 How many (and what) books are at the bindery? 
11 Has a certain book been rebound, and when? 
12 What books have been discarded? 
13 Does the circulation of a discarded book warrant its being replaced? 
14 Has a given borrower a book charged to him? 
14a (How many books are charged to him?) 
14b (What books are charged to him?) 
15 How many persons have now books charged to them? 
16 Are these the persons who registered earliest or latest? 
17 How often has a borrower made use of the library? 
18 Has a borrower had a given book before? 
{19 What has been the character of the borrower's reading? 
20 Is the borrower’s card still in force and used? 
21 (Has this person a right to draw books?)    
The principle of the grouping given above will be readily understood 
to be a rough classification by book, date, and borrower’s account. -~ 
It does not follow necessarily that the system which answers the most 
questions is the best, for they may be answered at an expense of time 
and labor out of all proportion to the value of the information. That is 
a point which each library must decide for itself. The college library, 
the free city library, the village library, have a widely differing patron- 
age and quite as widely differing resources. 
Loan systems may be roughly divided into four groups: Ledger sys- 
tems, temporary-slip systems, permanent-slip or card systems, indicator

  900 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
systems.. There are many ingenious devices that belong to none of 
these, but they are used in so few libraries that they hardly merit the 
name of system. 
Ledger system.—By ledger system we now mean a system in which 
books are used for recording charges. It is often taken for granted 
that in using a ledger the library keeps its accounts only under the 
borrower’s name; but it is possible to keep trace of the books also, and 
even to keep the accounts by date. Originally the charges were made 
in a daybook, a simple daily record of transactions such as kept by 
any retail shopman. No doubt it was considered a great step in 
advance when the library began to post these daily entries in a regu- 
lar ledger instead of looking back through all its charges till the one 
wanted was found. 
The ledger account by borrower has the borrower’s name for a head- 
ing and should have a page to itself in order that no two borrowers 
shall have the same folio number. The call number of the book and 
“the date of issue are noted in pencil in columns or squares ruled for 
them, and when the book is returned the borrower's folio number, if he 
has forgotten it, may be found from the index at the back of the ledger, 
and the entry is either crossed off or the date of return noted, which 
closes the account till another book is drawn. The advantages and 
disadvantages of this method may be summed up as follows: 
ADVANTAGES. 
. The entries can not be lost or mislaid. 
. The ledger takes up less space than the same information in any other form. 
. It can be handled rapidly. 
.! The borrower’s previous reading shows and may help in making selections for 
him or prevent the second taking of a book by mistake. 
5. It is easy to tell when a borrower's connection with the library ceases and how 
many live accounts there are on the book. 
ewe 
DISADVANTAGES. 
1. Impossible to change the order of accounts to alphabetic? or other order to get 
at certain facts. 
2. Pages, when soiled, can not be replaced. 
8.3 In the course of time an active reader may have several folio numbers, which 
would tend to confusion. 
4. But one person can use the ledger at a time. 
5. It is next to impossible to get at the delinquent accounts in order to send 
notices. 
Applying the test of our 21 questions, we find that it answers easily 
14-20, inclusive, nearly all, in fact, that apply to the reader; but with 
great difficulty, if at all, can the answers to 1-13 be found. By means 
of a daybook, questions 7 and 8 may be answered also. This gives the

additional advantages that the charge is very quickly made, the post- 
ing being postponed to a leisure moment; and that the circulation of 
each day can be easily classified, footed up, and set down. This book, 
like the ledger, can be used by only one person at a time, and it can 
not be used for discharging debts unless the date be given as a key. 
In the Library journal for 1883 a description is given of the method 
used by many Canadian libraries, notably those of the Mechanics’ 
institutes, in which two ledgers figure, the one arranged by readers’ 
accounts, the other by call numbers for the books, making book 
accounts. A daybook is used with this system, for the sake of speedy 
charging. 
To the borrower the daybook charge is very likely to be satisfactory. 
He has only to give the call number of the book wanted and his name. 
The charge is dashed down and he does not need to wait. When he 
returns the book, his name or folio number refers to the charge, now on 
the ledger, which is crossed off or the date of return jotted down oppo- 
site it, and that is all. He knows nothing of the time and labor given 
to rewriting every charge, or the difficulties that arise each day from 
the fact that the library has no account with the book. 
Temporary-slip system.—The inflexibility of the ledger system 
could not tal to be felt, and it has been superseded in many libraries by 
the temporary-slip system, of which a great advantage over the ledger 
system is that more than one person at atime can be engaged in charg- 
ing and discharging books. The slips may be used exactly as the 
ledger pages are used to keep an account with the reader, the difference 
in that case being that the ledger is a permanent and the slip a tem- 
porary record. The siip may be written out by the borrower, in which 
case it serves as a receipt, or by the assistant for the sake of greater 
speed. It 1s usually required that the borrower’s name or number, the 
call number of the book (or its author and title), and the date be 
written. When the book is returned and fines paid, if any, the slip 
may be destroyed or returned to the borrower. The slips may be 
arranged in a tray or in pigeonholes in any of three ways: (1) With 
guide cards or blocks for each day, making a daybook; (2) by bor- 
rower’s name or number, making an account with the borrower; (3) by 
eall number, making an account with the book. 
The first arrangement has the advantages of the regular daybook as 
to speed, provided that all that is written on the slip be the borrower's 
name or number and the call number. The date is here not necessary, 
although it is well to have it lest a slip should by accident be taken 
from its compartment. The slip is then dropped into the tray in the 
proper date division, and the borrower goes away with his book. The 
disadvantage is also the same, that, without remembering the date, a 
charge can not be canceled. It would be possible to keep a ledger in 
connection with this arrangement of slips, as with the regular daybook. 
The questions answered would then be 7, 8,9,14-20. It has the advan- 
 
-P-A-G-E-912
    
Le es eer een: 
  902 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
tage over the daybook that after the arrangement by date the slips 
ean be put in a subarrangement by borrower’s number or call number, 
and that the dates once written on the guides do not have to be rewrit- 
ten. The daybook, on the other hand, by the mere lapse of time, 
becomes a record of delinquents in such shape that it can not be lost, 
whereas the delinquent slips, in order to be quite safe, must be copied 
into a book after a certain period. 
When the slips are arranged by borrower’s name or number, they 
represent the borrower’s ledger with its outstanding accounts only. 
As the slips themselves are usually of thin paper, it is customary to 
haye cardboard guides, each bearing a borrower's name or number, or 
both, and when the charge is made the slip is dropped behind or in front 
of the borrower's card and remains there while the book is out. If the 
guides are arranged by borrowers’ numbers there must be an alphabetic 
index to the tray, as the numbers are often forgotten. This system 
answers questions 9, 14, 14a, 14b, 15, 16. The questions 17-20, which 
are answered by the ledger system, can not be solved by any temporary 
record. The main advantage of this way of keeping the borrowers’ 
accounts is the one mentioned above as pertaining to any slip system, 
that more than one person may work at it at onetime. It requires more 
writing than the ledger, inasmuch as the borrower’s name or number 
must be recorded. The difficulty of getting at the number of overdue 
books is quite as great, and if delinquent notices are sent the whole 
tray must be overhauled periodically. If these notices are sent only 
at long intervals, as in many subscription libraries, this is not so strong 
an objection as in the case of public libraries, which must send out 
notices daily. To the college library, or one that was watchful of its 
influence on various classes of readers, the fact that the record of a 
borrower's reading could not be kept would be a strong objection to the 
temporary slip system. 
The third arrangement, that of keeping the slips in order of the call 
number of the books, has been seldom tried where the slips were for 
temporary use only. It answers questions 1-4, 9. The objection with 
regard to delinquent notices holds here, as in the previous arrangement. 
Any change in the character of the circulation within a given period. 
would fail to be noticed by this system. Its main advantage lies in its 
-speedy answer to questions 1, 2, and 3, questions which are more often 
asked, perhaps, than any other, and in its convenience when it becomes 
time to take the inventory. It is but fair to the last two arrangements 
to say that if the day’s circulation is kept apart from the other charges 
till it can be classified and counted, one of the above disadvantages, the 
inability to discover changes in the character of the general reading, 
would disappear, and questions 7 and 8 could be answered. 
In some libraries the slip is made large enough to serve for a list of 
books, and if handed back to the borrower when he returns one book 
may serve him to select another.

  THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 903 
The late librarian of Princeton, Dr. I’, Vinton, suggested in Library 
journal, 2: 53-7, that the slips, before being sorted in their pigeon- 
holes, be copied, in order to make two arrangements possible, one by 
borrowers and one by books. Whenever there is copying done, there 
is an extra liability to mistakes, and the writer suggests, instead, the 
use of the carbon copy used by many dry goods and notion houses to- 
make duplicate checks for goods bought. Both entries would be in 
the same writing, made simultaneously, and if one was correct the 
other would have to be. 
Card system.—The card system differs from the slip system chiefly 
from the fact that the cards, larger and more durable than slips, are 
kept as a permanent record. Aside from this, they are subject to the 
same limitation, admit of the same arrangement, and answer the same 
purposes as slips. ; 
If but one kind of card is used by the library, it can be arranged 
with others to form an account with the borrower, with the book, or by 
date; and the same subarrangements possible with the slips are possi- 
ble here. The advantages and disadvantages are the same as with 
the same arrangement of slips. With cards it is advisable to have 
ruled columns to keep the record. If the card is a borrower’s ecard, 
the columns should contain the call number and the dates of taking 
and of return. If it is a book card, that is, kept in order of the call 
numbers, the columns should contain borrower’s number and dates. 
Some libraries show the discharge of a debt by stamping or punching 
out the charge instead of stamping the return date, which is thus lost 
from the records. The borrower’s card, kept by the library, answers 
questions 14-20, inclusive. By keeping the day’s charges in a separate 
place till the end of the day’s circulation, questions 7 and 8 may be 
answered. If asingle card is a book card, it will answer questions 
1-6, 13, 18, with 7 and 8 if the day’s charges are kept apart and 
eounted. If the book card is used, it may be kept in a pocket in the 
book when the book is in, or it may be placed in a separate tray at the 
desk to show what books are in and save useless trips to the shelves. 
Used in this way, it helps to form a card indicator, at the same time 
Jessening the risk of loss of the eard. If the cards of books out are 
kept in strict call-number order, without subarrangement by date, they 
may serve to indicate instantly the books out and thus fulfill the same 
office. The pocket for the book card is very generally used in libraries 
that have the book card. It serves for the borrower’s card when the 
book is out, in case the borrower carries his own card, and lessens the 
tisk of its loss. The labor of pocketing and repocketing, however, is 
considerable, and even aside from this, the writer questions whether 
for the library with few attendants the advantages from the card indi- 
eator do not outweigh those from the use of the pocket. 
The card has an advantage over the slip, inasmuch as the library 
ean obtain from it, according to the arrangement by book or borrower,
-P-A-G-E-914
  904 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
a record of the book’s use or the borrower’s reading. It is customary, 
in date systems, to have the date of taking written or stamped some- 
where in the book, either on the pocket or on a date slip tipped into the 
book, to avoid the necessity of leaving the fact to the memory of bor- 
rower or assistant. 
. Two-card system.—We come now to the two-card systems, in which 
the cards are those of the borrower and of the book, the latter kept 
usually in date order. We shall take up first the system which allows 
(or obliges) the borrower to carry his own card and present it when he 
wants a book. This provision answers at once question 21, the pre- 
sumption being that if the borrower is not the person presenting the 
card he has delegated his authority to that person by giving him the 
eard. A system without any card carried by the borrower either causes 
the library to run the risk of giving books to persons who have no right 
to draw them, or, as in the case of the Apprentices library in New 
York city, must require a written order when a book is wanted and 
no book is returned for exchange, and compare the signature of the 
order with that on the register. The library with a small clientele runs 
no great risk in requiring no card of identification, as every borrower 
would be apt to be known at the library, but the city library, with its 
‘large and ever-shifting body of readers, must have some method of 
identifying them and the card is certainly the simplest. 
The borrower's card for identification and the same as a part of the 
charging system are different things. For either use, the card should 
contain the borrower’s name, address, number, and the date of expira- 
tion of his privileges. 
There is a risk in making the borrower's card an essential part of the 
charging system when it is carried by the borrower, on account of the 
liability to loss; but if the facts noted on it serve simply as a check or 
to corroborate the record kept at the library, the question becomes 
simply one of economy of time and labor. The two-card system most 
widely used is probably that in which the borrower’s card records the 
eall number and date, and the book card the borrower’s number and 
date. On the return of a book, the dating slip in it and the date on 
the borrower's card should confirm each other, the latter can be marked 
with date of return and handed back, while the book card can be 
easily found by means of the number in the book at any convenient 
moment, whether kept in strict call-number order or by date. When 
found, the date of return is noted on it, the card placed in the pocket 
or the card indicator, and the process is complete. It will be noted 
that very little of this has to be done in the borrower’s presence. The 
question arises, of what use is the call number on the borrower's card, 
as it seems to be unnecessary in the checking off process. It gives, of 
course, a record of the borrower’s reading, but as he carries it that is 
of no particular value to thé librarian. It gives no clew to the book, if 
lost, as the card is generally kept in the pocket and lost with the book.
-P-A-G-E-915
  THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 905 
Some libraries dispense with this record, therefore, and save the time 
of writing. By doing this, the amount of writing before a book goes 
out is reduced to the date on the borrower’s card, and the borrower's 
number and date on the book card. This item can be omitted, however, 
only in case the library allows but one book on a card. The question 
may also be asked, what is the use of the date on the book card, if it 
is already on the borrower’s card and in the book, and the book cards 
are kept in date arrangement? One reason for this is that the book 
card is a record kept by the library, and the time of keeping a book is 
often a matter of interest in the gathering of statistics and a guide 
to areader’s thoroughness; another, that if a beok card should get 
out of its compartment by accident, there would be no way of finding 
its place again if it bore no date. 
By this system questions 1-9, 13-14, 17-21 are answered. Questions 
10-12 may be answered by any system using the book card, provided 
the cards of books sent to the binder or discarded are kept in separate 
compartments in the charging tray, by order of their call numbers. 
It must be remembered, however, that the answers to questions 14, 17, 
19, 20, and 21 are in the hands of the borrower and liable at any time 
to be lost. This system, with variations, is growing in favor among 
librarians, and has much to recommend it. 
The modus operandi of the Milwaukee public library, the Appren- 
tices’ library of New York City, the library of the Boston Atheneum, 
and of the Buffalo library has been described in the Library journal 
with some fullness and will be found interesting and suggestive, but - 
would occupy too much space if described here. Of the few card sys- 
tems which are in use in English libraries, we may mention the system 
of the Bradford library, which is described in the Library, vol. 3: 390, 
Dummy system.—The dummy system is an ingenious one for use 
in libraries with a limited constituency. Each borrower is represented 
by a wooden dummy, with his name and number on the outer edge. 
The sides are covered with paper ruled in columns. When a borrower 
wishes a book his dummy is taken from the alphabetic or numerical 
arrangement in which it is kept, the call number and date of issue 
noted on it, and it then takes the place of the book on the shelf. The 
return of the book gives the call number, the dummy is found and the 
charge canceled, the book returned to its place, and the dummy is 
ready for another charge and.to take the place of another book. If 
there is a call for a book not in, the dummy shows who has it and when 
itis due. This answers questions 1-4, 9-9a, 15, when the borrower is 
using a book, and 14, 17, 18, 19, when he has no book. 
Indicator System.—It is said that where the indicator is used for 
charging, as in many English libraries, the same method does not prevail 
in any two libraries; hence it is unnecessary to detail the various sys- 
tems; they differ from American charging systems chiefly inmaking use 
of a perpendicular instead of a horizontal tray for the cards or blocks,
-P-A-G-E-916
    906 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93, 
The indicator is a large wooden frame containing tiny oblong pigeon- 
holes, into which are fitted blocks, pegs, or cardboard slips represent- 
ing the books in the library, or certain classes of books. On both ends 
of the block is printed the call number of the book, one end having a 
blue ground, the other a red one. By making the red represent books 
in, and the blue books out, the public can tell at once if a given book 
ean be had and need not ask useless questions. The saving of time 
and labor, therefore, is greater than with the card indicator, where the 
assistant has to look through the cards in order to say if a book is in, 
but both devices save unnecessary journeys to the shelves, and the 
card indicator occupies less space. The use of the block indicator is 
confined, so far, almost entirely to British libraries. Where the indi- 
eator is used for charging, the block is superseded by a tiny book in 
which the charges are made, the top and bottom of the book being col- 
ored like the blocks referred to. 
A feature that exists in some of the indicator systems and in many 
card systems is the movable date tray. The date register of the indi- 
eator has, for instance, 11 columns for books not overdue and one extra 
eolumn for overdue books, and the date tray has 14 compartments for 
the former and one fer the latter. These trays move from right to left. 
As to-day’s circulation becomes yesterday’s, its tray is moved one space 
to the left, while the fourteenth tray shows that all cards left in it 
represent books one day overdue. These are removed to the tray for 
delinquents, leaving the empty tray to be used for the day’s cireulation:

ELEMENTS OF LIBRARY BINDING. 
By D, V. R. JOHNSTON, 
New York State Reference Librarian. 
Though the principles of library bookbinding are well known to 
librarians, a novice has difficulty in finding a usable statement of 
them. There are numerous good books on binding, but they are either 
text-books for the use of practical workmen or expositions of the his- 
tory and artistic development of binding, written for book lovers and 
eollectors. All these books are interesting and useful, but none of 
them give compactly just the information needed by practical librarians. 
While the Public libraries report of 1876, the proceedings of the 
A. L, A., and the L. A. U. K., the Library journal, and other library 
periodicals and manuals contain nearly all of value on the subject, yet 
there are many partly conflicting statements which must be examined 
and some misstatements which must be corrected. Binding a book 
means not only covering it, but preserving it. As binding is always 
expensive, a careful librarian must see that he gets the best binding for 
the purpose for the least money. 
Guard against extravagant or wasteful methods or habits of false 
economy, which are far worse. Good binding, even at a high price, has 
the advantages of educating public taste and promoting a desire. to 
protect a library from injury and loss. 
Cheap binding not only degrades books, but is actually liable to cost 
more in the end than good work. The labor expended on a book prop- 
erly bound in half morocco, calf, or sheep should be worth about the - 
same, and is not much less for a cloth binding, so that if unsuitable 
material is used, not only must it be replaced, but the labor, generally 
the most expensive item, must be paid for a second time. Each time a 
book is taken apart, scraped, cut, and rebound, it is more or less injured, 
and, if this is kept up, must in time be ruined. Strong, solid work and 
good materials are always worth their price, and 20 per cent added to 
the first cost of binding may often be regarded as insurance against 
further expense. 
As waste comes from not using material suited to the purpose, and as 
the market is full of fraudulent materials, the beginner’s first business 
is to inform himself carefully as to character, value, cost, and strength 
of all common binding materials. 
The most important binding material is that covering the back and 
forming the hinges. This costs most, represents most labor, and has 
hardest usage, but must not wear out if the binding is to be preserved. 
It is therefore necessary to know what material is best for different 
uses, and what grades of different materials will give greatest service 
for the cost. All who understand this subject agree on morocco as best 
for a book which is to have considerable use, but is not to be worn out
-P-A-G-E-918
  908 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
in circulation. Morocco or goatskin has by nature a long, tough tex- 
ture, and is supposed to be, and generally is, tanned by simple methods 
and not by modern chemical processes, so it will not only stand con- 
stant hard usage but will resist better than other leathers the corrod- 
ing influences of heat, foul air, and gas. But moroceos vary widely in 
quality and price, and are so cleverly imitated as to deceive even the 
best informed. Not only is it often hard to tell imitations from genuine 
morocco when in books, but still harder to tell the different grades of 
morocco from each other, so the only way that the inexperienced can 
keep from being cheated is to employ honest binders. 
That only the best morocco should be used is not strictly true. Use 
the best for each purpose; but the same thing is not best for all uses. 
The best morocco is Levant, costing from $42 to $60 a dozen, or from 
$3.50 to $5 a skin. This is about 50 to 65 cents a square foot, or about 
20 to 30 cents for each half-bound 8°. Though Levant is not only the 
handsomest morocco, but will outlast all others, its use in a library is 
generally counted extravagant, because its endurance is not propor- 
tionate to its added cost. song few librarians, however, believe other- 
wise, and continue to use Levant. 
The morocco best suited for library use is the grade known in the 
market as “ Haussmann” or “ genuine morocco,” which costs, according 
to size, thickness, and finish, from $18 to $33 a dozen, or from $1.50 to 
$2.75 per skin. All this grade of leather is good for some kinds of work, 
but usually that costing most is most enduring and hence cheapest. 
Morocco which costs from $26 to $33 a dozen, if it is of proper finish 
and thickness for good work, will cost just about the same per square 
foot, from 38 to 40 cents, the difference in price representing the differ- 
ence in size only. Since the smaller skins are always open to suspicion 
as to their general quality and usually give more waste, those costing 
from $30 to $33 per dozen are preferable, unless for some special reason. 
A $2.75 skin measures about 7 square feet, so this leather approximates 
40 cents per square foot, or from 13 to 15 cents for a half-bound 8°. 
As price of leather, size of skins, size of books, amount of waste, ete., 
are variable, all binding figures are approximations. 
The cheaper grades of “genuine morocco,” costing from $18 to 824 
per dozen, are smaller and thinner skins, and can be used to advantage 
only on small books having no hard use. This leather costs about the 
same as the better Persian morocco described below, but for most pur- 
poses is better. 
Persians in common use usually cost from $15 to $20 a dozen, though 
they vary from $10 to $24. The better grades of this skin are about the 
size of the cheaper grades of “genuine morocco,” and average about 6 
square feet, though some of the very best are as large as Haussmann 
skins. Averaging ordinary sizes and prices of Persian morocco, it 
costs about 20 to 25 cents a square foot, or, approximately, from 8 to 10 
cents for each half-bound 8°.
-P-A-G-E-919
  THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 909 
There seems to be little use for Persians, as only the better qualities, 
which overlap in price the cheaper grades of “genuine morocco,” can be 
trusted. Librarians in this country who have tried it do not report it 
satisfactory, though English circulating libraries, like Mudie’s and 
Smith’s, now use considerable of it. Persian, though looking and 
wearing pretty well, is more apt to fade than “genuine morocco,” and 
on exposure to heat sooner becomes hard and brittle. The lighter 
shades are apt to streak and scratch, so that the darker shades only 
are commonly in market. 
There are other grades of morocco, at from $6 to $12 a dozen, but the 
skins are very small and thin and have no place in library work, and 
indeed are very little used for binding. 
The so-called French and German moroccos, $15 to $18 a dozen, or 
about 7 to 9 cents for a half-bound 8°, are not much used in this 
country for library binding, though many imported books are bound in 
them. While most, if not all, this leather is made from sheepskin, yet 
it is often so well tanned that it will wear nearly as well as Persian, 
and European binders do not hesitate to advertise it under that name. 
It should, however, be avoided. 
Another imitation of morocco made from Persian sheep is known as 
bock. It is a small skin, costing $9 to $11 a dozen, or from 5 to 7 cents 
for a half-bound 8°. It wears scarcely better than good roan, and is a 
dangerous imitation, because it is hardly distinguishable from morocco 
on newly bound books. A considerable number of libraries, however, 
still use it. 
Other imitations of morocco are often made from common sheepskin, 
buffing, and other leathers, but as a rule they are not hard to detect. 
They are all bad. 
J.B. Nicholson (Manual on the Art of Bookbinding, Phil., 1856, p. 16) 
says that ‘there are in the British Museum books in calf supposed to 
have been bound in the time of Henry VIII.” Whether this is true or 
not, certainly no ealf binding done to-day will ever reach such antiq- 
uity. Calf in private collections is one of the handsomest of bindings, 
but for library purposes it must be condemned. Grades commonly used 
cost from $21 to $29 a dozen, and the cost per book of the different 
grades is almost the same as for morocco. As it requires careful hand- 
ling in the bindery to keep it from soiling and needs extra finishing, 
the cost of calf work is apt to be still higher in proportion. 
Aside from cost, calf has many faults. It becomes brittle and wears 
out at the joints; it is reduced to powder by heat and gas, so that vol- 
umes will often break their bindings by their own weight, and on 
account of the even, close grain it is easily soiled and scratched. 
Though these bad qualities are generally admitted, some librarians 
still prefer to stand the trouble and expense of using it rather than 
change the binding on long and handsome sets, and some contend that 
it is a good leather for circulating books, as it does not rot when in con-
-P-A-G-E-920
  910 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
stant use. All having to do with law books regret that full calf bind- 
ings are so largely used by British and colonial law publishers, as this 
style of binding is very dear, and yet hardly more useful than ordinary 
half-law sheep. 
Sheepskin, too, whether as black sheep, roan, or skiver, ought to be 
avoided when possible, as it is thoroughly unreliable. Roan costs from 
$8 to $11 a dozen, and varies much in durability and according to no 
known law, except that black and very dark leather is apt to be poorest. 
Skivers, or split roan, cost from $5 to $9 per dozen, and vary in strength 
from paper upwards, the best being more lasting than some roans. 
Skiver of course can only be used on very thin books, but even on 
them cloth is much better if the book is not worth a moroeco binding. 
Likewise it is well to substitute morocco or duck for roan on much-used 
books, or cloth if the book will spend most of its time on the shelves, 
as roan will stand neither the effects of usage nor of time. 
Law sheep, $6 to $12 a dozen, and law skiver, which costs the same, 
though standard bindings for law books and public documents, and in 
considerable use for other purposes, are thoroughly bad, as they look 
mean, wear poorly, and are dirty to handle. Their use in libraries 
should be curtailed as much as possible, specially as substitutes are 
easily found that look and wear better and cost less. 
Without a doubt, better sheepskin than that now in market could be 
made. Sheep and even skiver bindings used for forty or fifty years are 
not uncommon, and the old sumac-tanned sheep was really an excellent 
binding, but the sheepskin now sold is hopelessly bad. Skiver, sheep, 
and roan are worth from 7 to 10 cents per square foot, or from 2 to 24 
cents for a half-bound 89°, 
Another bad leather is russia, but as it is expensive, costing from 
$3.50 to $6 per skin, according to size, it is not much used. It is 
stronger than calf, but, like it, wears out at the joints and crumbles 
under action of heat and gas. The theory that its peculiar odor 
protects it from worms has been long ago exploded. 
Much better than genuine russia is its imitation, American russia. 
It is made from cowhide, and is a good, strong leather, the best next to 
morocco. American russia costs from 12 to 18 cents a square foot 
when plain, or from 16 to 24 cents a square foot when grained to imitate 
morocco, seal, or other leathers. This is about 3 to 6 cents for each 8° 
book for plain, and 4 to 8 cents for the fancy kind. Buffing, or split 
American russia, costs from 5 to 10 cents a square foot, or from 1} 
to 25 cents per 8°. The durability of this leather depends very much 
on its thickness. When thick it can be used on maps, newspapers, 
ete., with good results, though better results can be had for less money 
from duck. For a cheap leather binding American russia is prefera- 
ble to roan or sheep, and indeed will wear better than any other leather 
except moroceo. For law books, public documents, etc., American 
russia of almost the exact shade of law sheep can be had which will

  THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. Sit 
wear far better than sheep and cost not more than 2 cents a volume 
more than half sheep. 
Pigskin now in the market costs from $7.25 to $11.75, according to 
size, quality, and finish. It has a handsome finish and a grain quite as 
good looking as morocco. As a pigskin is from two to three times 
larger than a genuine morocco, the price per square foot is about the 
same. Itis an intractable leather and requires careful handling to 
make it look well ina book. It tends to harden and become brittle if 
not handled often, and is suspected of mildewing, so it seems unwise to 
bind in it for general use. However, it seems a very good if not the 
best material for table books, such as dictionaries, catalogs, ete., as it 
stands rough usage without scratching or becoming shabby. 
The use of buckram in this country has never been large, and many 
librarians who have experimented with it have given it up. It is not 
at all cheap, as it costs 35 to 50 cents a yard. It is hard to work, as 
it takes glue and gold badly. On exposure it becomes brittle and is 
liable to fade like any book cloth. Linen bueckram, the highest priced 
and best, has been practically unknown to the American market from 
the first, though, as it is hard to tell it from the cotton cloth, the fact is 
not generally known. Wherever buckram is used duck will answer 
most of the purposes at less cost, as it is worth only from 10 to 20 cents 
per yard. Duck is easily worked and possesses all the requirements 
for a strong, cheap binding suitable for circulating libraries, oversize 
books in little use, maps, and newspapers.. On the other hand, duck is 
rough, ill looking, and will not take gold lettering well; and asitis not 
wise to letter on labels, one is limited to shades light enough to show 
ink lettering and dark enough not to show soil. Since the friction of 
duck is great, it is always a good plan to bind very large volumes in 
half duck with paper sides. Theuse of half duck on smaller books is 
growing in favor. 
Books having infrequent use, if not oversize, will last quite as well 
in cloth as in leather. Book cloth, costing from 12 to 20 cents per yard, 
will answer even better than expensive morocco, since heat and gas have 
no effect on its vegetable fiber. Remember, though, that cloth work is 
generally case work and will not stand much wear. 
The use of vellum in this country has so far disappeared that no data 
regarding it can be obtained. Some of the English binders claim to 
use it with satisfaction. 
When binding in leather avoid both very light shades, which are most 
expensive and will not keep clean, and very dark, specially black and 
very dark green, which may be tender. Skins which are failures in 
lighter shades are often re-dyed black, and this tends to rot the leather. 
The best colors are the lighter browns, red, light greens, olive, blue, and 
maroon. : 
Bindings should be pleasing to the eye and sufficiently diversified not 
to rob the bocks of their individuality. Butasit is annoying to choose 
   
-P-A-G-E-922
  3 912 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
- acolor for each book and to have innumerable styles which must be 
matched, different color schemes have been devised and used by differ- 
ent librarians, some assigning colors to subjects, some to languages, 
etc. None of these schemes are without objections, and none are in 
common use, 
Reports of societies, institutions, ete., should be bound by regular 
periods, such as decades or semidecades, as they are more useful in 
such condition. Pamphlets when bound should be flush at the top so 
as not to gather dust. Some larger libraries bind covers of periodicals, 
pamphlets, and books issued in parts, some placing them at the end of 
the volume and others binding them in their original order. The cus- 
tom, too, is gaining favor of binding half titles, advertising leaves, ete., 
with the covers. This custom is not indorsed for any but very large 
reference libraries, as it materially adds to the expense; but for them 
itis strongly recommended. The public have the right to expect that 
a library maintained in part for collecting and preserving records of 
human thought and action will not neglect to preserve in original form 
the issue of the contemporary press; and a proper regard for the future 
demands the preservation of all the printed matter possible. 
Sewing.—To secure the best results in sewing—to gain strength and 
flexibility—the book must-not be deeply sewed, and every fold of more 
than four leaves should be sewn “all along” whenever possible. Lf, how- 
ever, a smaller thread must be used in sewing all along to produce the 
correct swell to the back, it.is better to sew “two on” or alternately 
with a stronger thread. Hayes’s Irish linen thread, costing from 90 cents 
to $1.10 per pound, will give best results. Every volume above a 16mo 
should be sewn on at least three bands, and this number should be 
increased according to size and thickness of volume. The thread in all 
cases should always completely encircle each band, not simply pass over 
or under it in a loop. The first and last signatures should be overcast 
or whip-stitched, or sewed with a sewing machine. 
All maps and. folding plates in books which have much use should be 
backed with muslin, but as this costs 6 cents apiece, for less used books 
a muslin joint at the fold can be used, costing only about a third as 
much, All plates, however, in large volumes should be mounted at 
least on a cloth guard, or they are apt to be crumpled or torn. 
Books which are sewn on tapes, parchment strips, or other raised 
bands, last better and open more freely than others, with the added 
advantage of not being deeply sewed. Some suppose that they are not 
sewed at all, but as a rule a shallow cut is made on each side of the 
band to guide the sewer. 
Raised-band sewing not being generally practiced, and sewers being 
unskilled in ‘doing the work, it is apt to be expensive, sometimes three 
or four times the price of ordinary sewing. But if raised-band sewing 
were more common there seems to be no reason why the cost should
-P-A-G-E-923
  
THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 913 
be more than 5 or 10 cents a volume higher than good band sewing. 
Outside the large cities almost the only place where tape sewing is 
practiced is in certain blank-book binderies, and such places, as a rule, 
do not do good library binding. 
In spite of the added cost, books having the most frequent use should 
be sewed without sawing or on raised bands. On books of music, vol- 
umes of maps, plates, manuscripts, and other works which should open 
with the greatest freedom, tapes should be used. 
Tapes are not generally laced into boards, but are glued on the inside 
of the covers, so in this respect band sewing has the advantage as the 
bands can be-laced completely through the board, thus giving the book 
greater strength. 
Every book, if bound for use, should have vellum corners, which, if 
properly put on, is a great protection in case the book is carelessly 
dropped, as it will dent the wood of ‘the floor rather than break. These 
corners should be carefully skived down so.as not to make a projection 
against which the siding will wear itself out, and should be not less than 
38cm. long on a book larger than a 12mo as, in case of a fall, a small 
corner will help break off the board inclosed by it. There should be 
no added charge for vellum over leather corners, as scrap vellum is 
large enough for this use. : 2 
Whether tight or loose backs are the better is hard to determine. 
The latter are used by most American libraries, presumably for good 
reasons, while the former are recommended by nearly all binding 
experts. Ina tight back, the leather being fastened to the back forms 
part of the book itself, binding it close at every point and acting as a 
hinge joint at each place where the book is opened. In a loose back, 
the leather is hardly more than a connection between the boards, the 
first linings being all the support to the back; hence, at the joint at 
the edge of the board there is a constant strain which must result in 
breaking the cord if the book is in frequent use. Unless a tight back 
is well made it will not wear smoothly nor open freely; but when the 
work is well done it will outlast a loose back and will open very nearly 
as well. A loose back looks better, especially when finished with false 
raised bands, but as these bands add nothing to the strength of a 
book, and may even weaken the leather, their use is inadvisable. 
The cost of finishing the tops-and edges should be reduced as much 
as possible, as all that is needed is to protect the top from dust. Bur- 
nishing with agate at a cost not exceeding 14 cents a volume will do 
this almost as well as gilding, which costs from 10 to 20 cents a top, or 
marbling at from 3 to 5 cents, or coloring at about 10 cents per volume. 
In finishing the back all tooling and ornamentation should be eschewed, 
except perhaps plain gilt cross lines and blind tooling to divide the 
back into panels, and perhaps a plain gilt fillet where the leather and 
sidings join. The lettering should be in plain Roman capitals and 
ED 93. 538   
 
-P-A-G-E-924
  914 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Arabic numerals, large enough to be easily read, and should be stamped 
on the binding and never on labels, which are liable to come off. Use of 
old English, German, or other fancy types, punctuation marks, and 
Roman notation, is confusing to the eye and should not be allowed. It 
is a great convenience to have the lettering alwaysin the same relative 
position, and the following arrangement is recommended: Name of 
author in top panel, with initials if needed; a brief comprehensive title 
condensed from title-page if possible, in the second; editor, translator, 
or commentator, if necessary, in the third; and the year, whole number 
of the volume, the series and series volume, in the order mentioned, 
without prefixing v., vol., band, etc., in the fourth. Rarely, as in news- 
papers, it is well also to add the months. When books are bound 
together put the author of the leading book in the top panel and its 
title in the second, and the author and title of the second book in the 
third panel. When books have permanent class and book numbers 
they should be gilded on the bottom panel in 8° and smaller volumes, 
and in the top of the first panel of larger volumes. Lettering costs 
only from 3 to 5 cents per line, and the saving in time and trouble spent 
in constantly replacing paper numbers will warrant the outlay. 
Paper sidings are ordinarily most satisfactory, cost 2 or 3 cents less 
than cloth and wear almost as long. They give little friction on the 
shelves, do not curl at the edges, fray at the ends, nor blister with 
moisture, as will cloth. Moreover, paper when worn out can be more 
easily replaced. Full leather work, except in rare cases, is very costly, 
and having no advantage has no place in a library. 
Cost of binding varies so much in different places and with the style 
and quality of work, that it is hard to give reliable figures. Accord- 
ing to the answers given to the binding circular sent out by the com- 
parative library exhibit, an 8° binding costs in—

While in parts of the country, owing to competition and other 
causes, binding prices have gone down within the last few years, yet, 
as in most European countries the cost has risen in spite of competi- 
tion, we have no reason to expect that work will ever be much cheaper 
here than at present. 
Of foreign work the French is cheapest and most satisfactory. 
English binding, when in morocco, is excellent, specially in the for- 
warding; and German work, while sometimes not so good as either of 
the others, is now generally good, and is certainly an advance on that 
of a few years ago. 
The cost of binding an 8° in half morocco is, in London, 3s. 6d. [84 
cents]; in Leipzig, 2m. 25pf. [56 cents]; in Paris, 2f. [40 cents], so money 
ean still be saved by having books bound abroad. 
The temptation to start a bindery in a library is often very great 
to anyone familiar with the cost and character of good work. Good 
binderies and fair prices are not common even in large cities, and in 
places remote from these centers bookbinding is either crudely done or 
is charged for at fancy rates. 
A library wishing first-class work of all kinds will almost certainly 
lose money by doing its own work, if its binding account is not more 
than $2,500 per year, and if it expends from $2,500 to $3,000 it will 
still be on the doubtful list, but on larger sums it should make money. 
Suecess depends entirely on a proper subdivision of labor, and no 
bindery can hope to make a profit if it has not work for at least three 
hands. The experiment has been thoroughly tried, and enough data 
have been collected to show that none but large and rapidly growing 
libraries can expect to run a bindery at a profit, and that even these 
can hope for only small financial gain. 
One great exception to this rule should be noted. Some of the - 
rapidly circulating libraries in large cities, where books are bound for 
constant use, and with the expectation that many will wear out in 
service, have found that they can save money by doing their own work 
when their binding bill is no more than $1,000 or $1,500 a year. Not 
requiring good workmanship, cost of labor is low, sometimes less than 
$900; and by binding in duck, buffing, and other cheap materials, often 
using the old covers, the cost of stock is kept down, sometimes below

5 cents a volume. They find that in binding 3,500 volumes or more 
they can save money. This kind of binding is suitable for this pur- 
pose, but has no place in a library which binds for preservation. In 
that the case is different. Suppose you have your plant, which will 
cost from $650 to $800, all paid for, and are willing to leave out of 
calculation the interest on both plant and stock, cost of light, heat, 
bookkeeping, insurance, etc., and you expect to do $2,500 worth of 
work a year. You will require a finisher at $20 a week, a forwarder at 
$12, and a sewer at $6, so in round numbers the labor will cost $1,975 
a year. But the stock used in doing this work, if conditions are the 
same as now exist in the New York State library, will cost from $575 
to $625, so that total cost will be from $2,550 to $2,600. If, however, } 
you do $3,000 worth of work, you may require another hand, an appren- 
tice at $4 a week, which will make your labor cost in round numbers 
$2,185, and the stock will cost from $690 to $750, so that the total cost 
will be from $2,875 to $2,935, 
These approximations, deduced from practical experience, are meant 
to represent in all cases the highest cost and most disadvantageous 
circumstances. The indirect advantages, however, are many and val- 
uable: Safety, convenience, saving of time, certainty of having work 
done as wanted, and the ability to have work done outside at figures 
much lower than binders would give if they did not have to compete 
with your own. These advantages are not to be disregarded or under- 
estimated, but if direct money gain alone is to be considered it can not 
be looked for in a library bindery.   
ScHooL AND COLLEGE LIBRARIES. 
By GrorGe T. Litre, 
Librarian of Bowdoin College, Brunswick, Me. 
The object of school and college libraries is to aid in the education 
of a limited number of persons. This aim separates them in a measure 
from public libraries and alone justifies the attempt to treat in a single 
chapter of the administration of collections varying in size from 300 to 
300,000 volumes.! 
No institution of learning can live without books. No group of 
students, whether young or old, can grow in knowledge without access 
to alibrary. This library becomes for the time being an agent in their 
education. Like any piece of school apparatus it may bring injury by 
misuse, lose its value by neglect, or, well managed, produce results 
beneficial beyond anticipation. In any case its purpose remains the 
!The plan assigned to this paper excludes alike a statistical account of the present 
condition of school and college libraries, and an historical statement of their 
remarkable growth during the last eighteen years and of the striking changes in 
methods. Any occasion for the former is largely met by Miss Lodilla Ambrose’s 
comprehensive paper entitled “‘A study of college libraries,” published in Library 
Journal, 18: 113,

same. It is there to supplement and make real the instruction given 
by text-book and teacher. So different, however, are its methods of 
working in schools of different grades and among students of different 
attainments, that at the outset a rough distinction must be drawn 
between the school, the college, and the university library.' 
School libraries.—The school or academy library should be operated 
by the teachers without a professional librarian.? It should be limited 
in size. It should require no catalog besides a simple shelf list. Hach 
teacher should know its contents. Its volumes should be selected with 
the utmost care.* The best and only the best should be the motto. It 
should contain every reference book that the ingenuity of the instructor 
can get his pupils to consult with profit. Duplicates, and even tripli- 
1 Recent thought refuses to treat “college” and “ university ” as synonyms, and 
differentiates as sharply between college and university as between high school and. 
college. The college course proper begins where the high school leaves off and com- 
pletes the gymnasial training which should precede the purely elective study and 
research of the university, or the direct preparation for duty given by professional 
and technical schools. The word university, instead of being loosely used as a 
synonym for college, or as referring to a group of professional and technical schools, 
properly refers to an institution which in faculty, libraries, laboratories, material 
equipment and endowment offers facilities for exhaustive scholarly research of that 
type for which a complete college education with its thorough gymnasial training 
is assumed as the necessary preliminary. Thus the eight years’ gymnasium train- 
ing is divided into the four-year high school course followed by the four-year col- 
lege course. In fact, however sound this theory, few American colleges fit these 
proper definitions. Of the 450 alleged colleges and universities, perhaps a majority 
are doing more or less high-school work, not really requiring the four years of prep- 
aration. Of the better institutions, a large number, instead of beginning as they 
should where the high school leaves off, require a year or more of further prepara- 
tion for admission. Nota few, however, carry the college work over by a year or 
more into the proper university field. ‘Then the word has in the past been so indefi- 
nitely used that many colleges are of much higher grade than many other institu- 
tions which have taken the name university. 
In reading this paper, therefore, the academy and university library may be 
clearly understood, but the theory of the college library will depend on what the 
college means. If by strict definition it is the last four years of a gymnasial course, 
it will resemble the academy library more closely. If, however, as most laymen 
assume, it is really an undersized university, then the ideals for the university 
library should be the guide and be modified and reduced to fit this conception. All 
will doubtless concede however that a sharp distinction exists between academy 
and college library; that the former is for the older school children, while the col- 
lege library treats its readers as adults. Between high school and college seems to 
run the line that separates the boy from the man in education, though he attains 
his legal majority some three years later, or about senior year.—M. D. 
‘The words school and academy are here used to denote an institution occupying 
a single building for educational purposes, in which pupils spend several hours of 
the day in study and recitation. Itis obvious that the libraries of certain normal 
schools and of old and well-endowed academies with advanced courses of study are 
not to be limited either in the way or to the degree essential to the success of libra- 
ries in city schools and country academies, where with difficulty a single room is 
secured for them. 
3 The use to which such books can be put is well set forth in Library Journal, 8: 24.

cates in some cases, of the most popular and useful of these must be 
supplied. Waiting one’s turn after school to consult Webster’s diction- 
ary will destroy the efficiency of the library for the ordinary academy 
scholar almost as much as the absence of that work. It should contain. 
an abundant supply of what may be termed collateral reading: i. e., 
popular and instructive books relating to every part of the curriculum. 
These books should be bought only on satisfactory evidence of their 
being adapted for the work in question. They should be alluded to and 
quoted by the teachers in their recitations; they should be personally 
recommended to different individuals, and, in general, circulated as 
widely as possible among the pupils.. When a volume is found to be 
both instructive and specially interesting let there be no hesitation in 
procuring duplicates. More is accomplished by five copies of a good 
book that finds its own readers than by ten good books that must be 
helped to an audience. 
The school library should be classified by some simple system. The 
appreciation of the distinction between general books of reference, 
books on history, on science, of general literature, is the first step to 
their correct use. The growth of the collection, moreover, must not be 
allowed to interfere with those material conveniences which make the 
use of books easy and afford the charm that so often characterizes the 
private library—spacious tables, a broad window seat, comfortable 
chairs. Better an extra easy chair than an extra case of government 
documents. But it must grow. Nothing will injure its efficiency more 
than lack of new books. New editions of standard works of reference 
must be secured. Rees’s Cyclopedia was a most valuable work in its 
day. Its presence now in a school library of 2,000 volumes will rightly 
cast suspicion on the entire collection. New books for collateral read- 
ing should be constantly added. Whenever the book of the day about 
which everyone is talking happens to be fitted for this purpose let it 
be secured without delay. The addition of one such book may give 
the library an importance and influence in some quarters that it has 
hitherto failed to gain. 
One characteristic of the school library sharply separates it from the 
majority of public libraries. Its growth is limited by physical consid- 
erations which can be overcome only at great expense and with doubtful 
profit. Constant accessions must not convert the reading room into a 
book stack. In a word, the duty of withdrawing books when the col- 
lection is in danger of becoming unwieldy is as great as that of care in 
selection at the outset. The task is difficult, but quite feasible. Take 
care that some large library in the neighborhood has a copy of each vol- 
ume to be discarded. Then withdraw promptly old editions of reference 
books and duplicates no longer used, and cautiously that large class of 
  
1 The advantages are greater and the difficulty less in high school than in public 
libraries, but even here the greatest caution must be exercised, the only safe rule 
being that in all doubtful cases the books shall not be withdrawn.—M. D.

  books, excellent in their day, but less popular than their younger rivals; 
e. g., remove Mrs. Mann’s Flower People to give place for Miss Harris’s 
Wild Flowers and Where they Grow.! 
These few sentences, though relating to concrete matters, perhaps 
explain sufficiently the special field of the school or academy library. 
It should enable the teacher to round out the instruction of the recita- 
tion hour by referring the pupil to standard sources of information for 
answers to the questions that naturally arise; and, what is alike more 
important and more difficult, it should enable him to rouse and main- 
tain an interest in the subject studied by attractive and entertaining 
collateral reading. Its efficiency, however, depends largely not only on 
the hearty cooperation of the teachers, but also on the time and thought 
which they can devote to it. With the simplest possible organization 
much care and labor is needed to keep the collection in order. This 
often makes it wiser not to form a special library and to depend on the 
public library of the place, specially when this is conducted according 
to advanced and liberal views. Each room will still require certain 
books of reference, but in place of a collection from which shall be 
drawn the reading matter for the entire school, each teacher should be 
encouraged to call on the public library for the books required to illus- 
trate his teaching. The various methods of bringing about this helpful 
relation between the two great educational forces in the community are 
fully set forth by Miss H. P. James in the article on “Libraries and 
schools” (see p. 693). 
College libraries.—While the college library accomplishes much 
that has been allotted to the school library, its aim is distinctly broader 
and higher. Its instruction is confined to no curriculum. It answers 
all questions. It should teach alike the wideness of human knowledge 
and the interdependence of its various departments. While the school 
library does its work well with 2,000 volumes the college library may — 
require 50,000. These are to be selected carefully and systematically, 
though not with that painstaking exclusion of all save the best which 
characterized the building of the former. A sprinkling of second and 
third rate books will help rather than hurt. For having in school 
learned to put his trust in books as the source of truth, the pupil is to 
discover in college how untrustworthy and contradictory a source some 
of them are. The varying factors of the purpose and the prejudices of 
their authors must be brought to his attention and he must diserimi- 
nate. In other words, he must learn to think, the best lesson a college 
course can teach. The ability to comprehend different statements of 
fact, to weigh the value of differing opinions and to form an impartial 
judgment as to the truth, means success in after life. The college 
library is the workshop where this trait can be developed and trained. 
1For discussion of this weeding-out process for town libraries see §. S. Green’s 
chapter on ‘Adaptation of libraries to constituencies,” p. 698, and the note as to the 
serious objections to the plan.—M. D.  
-P-A-G-E-930
  920 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
It should, therefore, be encyclopedic in its range and impartial in its 
selection. It is as unwise to exclude the Bridgewater treatises as out 
of date as to reject Haeckel as atheistic. There must be constant effort 
both to secure as soon as possible an authoritative statement of each 
recent advance in knowledge, and to keep on the shelves the best com- 
pends and popular presentations of each department of religious, natu- 
ral, and social science. Too often this completeness is sacrificed either 
to the inordinate demands of a few instructors or to a striving for mere 
numbers. It is pitiable for a college library to say as loudly as books 
can speak, “ We care for nothing here save philology and political econ- 
omy;” or to find another that has existed half a century, numbers as 
many thousand volumes, and yet can not supply material for a course 
of reading in the national literature. 
University libraries.—If the college library teaches schitans, the uni- 
versity library teaches teachers. While it is able to do the work of the 
two classes just mentioned, the function that separates it from them is 
the aid it renders to original research. It is an engine by which new 
truth is discovered. All knowledge is its sphere, whether that knowl- 
edge has been digested in books or not. Hence the university library 
is often called on to expend as many thousands on periodicals alone as 
the college library devotes to books and periodicals. The investigator 
must both stand on the past and be abreast with the present. The 
university library is not only warranted in storing away every bit of 
the printed thought of bygone days it can obtain, but is also forced to 
be constantly seeking the latest tidings from workers in widely sepa- 
rated fields, It must be catholic; it refuses no gift; it counts nothing 
trash. The college library may, the university library must, have de- 
partmental libraries. It must not only duplicate many of its books, 
but be so well organized as to place at short notice all of its resources 
on any topic in a departmental library or a laboratory for the use of the 
investigator and as readily withdraw to the central storehouse what is 
no longer of service.' The general public, too, has its claims. As the 
ideal university professor stands for the advance of truth in his depart- 
ment, and answers honest inquiries from the outside world as readily 
as those from his lecture room, so the university library should place 
its treasures at the disposal of any intelligent seeker after knowledge 
whose questions can not elsewhere be answered. 
COLLEGE LIBRARY ECONOMY. 
Despite these differences, it is often difficult to assign the library of 
a particular college to any one of these classes. It may be gradually 
growing out of one class into another, or by reason of special circum- 
stances may have assumed additional functions. With an oan

ence, seminary, and department libraries at Cornell University, in Library Journal,

  principal the library of a country academy may well supply the place 
of a village circulating library of high grade. A college library is 
sometimes called on to do the work of a State historical society. 
The existence close at hand of endowed libraries devoted to special 
branches of knowledge justifies a university library in neglecting its 
development along those lines. In every case, however, these three 
classes of libraries are collections of books which must be obtained, 
recorded, arranged, consulted, and circulated. The methods employed 
in accomplishing this will not in most details differ materially from 
those pursued in the ordinary public library of similar size. It is pro- 
posed, therefore, to mention only those points of library economy which 
either in themselves or in the degree of attention to be given them 
demand the special consideration of the college librarian.! Unless 
otherwise specified, the following statements refer in general to institu- 
tions having from 30,000 to 60,600 volumes and purchasing from 1,000 
to 2,000 annually. 
Selection of books.—This task, the more important the more lim- 
ited the means, is divided between teachers and librarian. Through 
a library committee, of which the librarian is the working member, a 
rough division is made among the departments of the amount avail- 
able for buying books and periodicals, a considerable part being reserved 
for special purchases and possible contingencies. Books are then form- 
ally recommended from time to time by the various professors and 
bought to the extent of the appropriation. The librarian should 
assume the duty of selecting books in departments not claimed, or, as 
occasionally happens, neglected by the faculty. He feels most keenly 
any deficiency of the library in standard works, either of reference or 
in general literature, and is, therefore, the one who should endeavor 
gradually to supply this lack.? It sometimes becomes his duty to check 
an otherwise exemplary teacher who persists in ordering only what is of 
service to himself, ignoring the needs of the student body. The bane 
of a small college library is an ambitious specialist allowed to have his 
own way. 
'The writer has had the privilege of examining the replies to an extended series of 
inquiries, prepared by Charles E. Lowrey, librarian of the University of Colorado, 
and relating to every detail of college library administration. His regret that the 
space at his disposal will not allow the insertion of even a digest is lessened by the 
hope that a full statement of them may be printed later. 
Many valuable suggestions can be obtained from the annual reports of Melvil 
Dewey, librarian of Columbia College, 1884-88. 
2The principles governing selection of books are outlined by James M. Anderson 
in Library Journal, 2: 150, A full and logical statement of the class of books a col- 
lege library should contain is given by Otis H. Robinson in Library Journal, 6: 96. 
See also the latter part of Justin Winsor’s article in United States Bureau of Edu- 
cation, Circular of Information No. 1, 1880, ‘College libraries as aids to instruction.” 
This pamphlet, invaluable to every college librarian, touches on many of the points 
considered in this chapter, and is‘here cited once for all.  
-P-A-G-E-932
  922 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892 93. 
It may seem superfluous to add that each college library should pos- 
sess all publications of the institution itself and works of its alumni. 
Unfortunately, the experience of the older colleges shows the danger of 
delay or neglect in this direction: Great pains must be taken and 
patience exercised to give to this department the special value that 
comes from completeness. 
Hardly less important than the selection of books is that of periodi- 
cals.! Generally the demand of the progressive members of the faculty 
for serials in their departments is far in excess of the means to supply _ 
them. Each department should have some of the material needed in 
keeping abreast with discovery and research in that line. At the same 
time it is incumbent on the librarian to guard against such an expendi- 
ture on publications giving tentative results and preliminary sketches 
as will prevent the library from procuring the monographs digested 
from this mass. These latter will continue serviceable long after the 
journals themselves have become useful only in studying the history of 
the science. The college library, being debarred by its income from 
attempting to cover the entire field, should take, first of all, represent- 
ative periodicals in-English sufficient to enable the student body to 
keep in touch with the subjects of the day, adding, if possible, one gen- 
eral or literary periodical of France and of Germany; then it should 
endeavor to supply the wants of its professors, having regard more to 
the use likely to be made by the various departments than to an impar- 
tial division among them. 
It is rarely the case that cooperation can not double this material 
with but slight increase of expenditure. Most teachers will be willing 
to take personally some periodical that the library can not afford, and 
frequently will put this, with the exception of current numbers, at the 
disposal of the librarian. Many graduates will be willing to supply the 
publications of some society in which their membership is more a matter 
of general than of personal interest. Neighboring public libraries can 
be depended on for the loan of less used serials, while consultation at 
the time of making up the periodical list will often lessen the individual 
and increase the joint list. As arule it is a mistake to discontinue a 
periodical taken for several years, except on account of a marked change 
in its character or standing. The value of the early volumes becoming 
more and more historical, this is increased in proportion to the length 
of time covered. 
Classification of books.—When the books suited to the purposes of 
the library have been thus selected by instructors who may be con- 
sidered experts in their several departments, and by a librarian who has 
access to the best bibliographic aids and has been trained in their use, 
there still remains the problem of bringing the books and the students 
together. This involves at least three things, classification of books by 
subjects, access to shelves by students, and instruction in bibliology

by professors or librarian. All admit that an arrangement of books by 
subjects is essential to the proper administration of a college library. 
There is fast coming to be a practical agreement that under ordinary 
conditions this arrangement can be successfully maintained only by 
combination with what is known as the “movable location ;” i. ¢., a sys- 
tem of marking which indicates the place of each book by its subject- 
matter rather than the place assigned it on a certain shelf. 
As to the system of classification to be adopted, there is a wide dif- 
ference of opinion. In our oldest university library, “the idea has been 
to make such an arrangement as would best accommodate the officers 
of the university who may have occasion to work at the shelyes.”! In 
another young and prosperous university this object has been attained 
by a large number of departmental libraries, built up, it would almost 
seem, at the expense of the central library, which recently did not 
noticeably exceed some of them in size and attractiveness, At Cor- 
nell University, also, “practical convenience rather than any strictly 
logical method” has been followed in the classification adopted? At 
Columbia College the decimal classification was introduced by its author 
in 1883, and the phenomenally rapid growth of the collection of books 
there has not as yet led to any essential modification of the system of 
arrangement. ‘ 
Not following the example set them by many well-endowed. universi- 
ties, most of the colleges that have been led to reclassify their libraries 
during the last fifteen years have adopted some one of the fully elabo- 
rated and published schemes of classification, too well known to require 
mention here, and have not attempted to construct a new scheme that 
should avoid the defects of the former and better answer local require- 
ments. It is in place to mention briefly the advantages of this course. 
Experience has proved these not perfect, but practicable. College or 
large reference libraries have used them with satisfaction. They have 
had the advantage of the best thought and criticism of the library pro- 
fession of the day, and the changes that the future will make necessary 
are not likely to be so great as in a scheme devised from the standpoint 
of a single library and necessarily molded in a great degree by its 
present condition. 
Again, the fact that their various subdivisions are clearly stated in 
print gives them a definiteness that is of great practical value. The 
librarian, his assistants, and all interested in the matter can understand 
from the outset the arrangement that is attempted. Reclassification 
may go on in different subjects without danger of interference. Asa 
rule a new scheme is put in operation before all the details are decided. 
The almost inevitable result is that frequent changes are made out of 
deference to some influential teacher, whose views were not known at

the start and may prove exactly opposite to those of his successor. It 
is agreed, for instance, that a chronologic arrangement of English 
literature is helpful for purposes of study; but it is not likely that three 
successive occupants of the chair of English will hold the same opinion 
as to how far this principle should be followed in arranging the books, 
or the number of periods to be recognized. 
The slighting allusions occasionally made by prominent librarians to 
these schemes seem often to apply to the notation recommended by 
their authors, or the minute classification which they will allow, rather 
than to the arrangement of books they aim to accomplish. The material 
accessories in the way of indexes, explanatory matter, and printed shelf 
labels, which are offered in connection with at least one of these systems, 
are of considerable importance and could not be secured for a new 
scheme save at a cost almost prohibitive to the ordinary college library. 
Access to shelves.—A scheme of classification having been carried 
out and made obvious by shelf labels and placards, access to the shelves 
becomes necessary, not merely to reap the benefits of the labor thus 
expended but also to accomplish the aim of the library itself. To have 
the literature of a subject together where it can be surveyed at a glance 
is as needful for thorough as for speedy investigation. Every time a 
student removes from the shelves four or five books on the same topic, 
glances at their contents and selects the one that in his opinion will 
best serve his purpose, he not only takes the most important step 
toward attainment of the desired information, but also employs his 
faculties in the manner best adapted to strengthen his power of judg- 
ment and to quicken his perception of truth. This tasting before one 
eats can not be done by proxy. The hand of the attendant and the 
moments of time intervening between the seeker and his shelf full of 
books is in practice destructive of this use of the library. 
A certain familiarity with the titles and appearance of books, only 
to be gained by repeatedly seeing them on the shelves, is often of value 
to the college graduate in after life. In some communities he is still 
supposed to have studied everything. His influence in his specialty is 
impaired if he shows ignorance of other matters. A mere knowledge 
of the physical difference between Stalker’s Life of Paul and Young’s 
Concordance may convince all the teachers in the Sunday school that 
the village physician should be consulted in selecting the village library. 
Furthermore, the idle curiosity that leads many a student to roam 
through the alcoves of the college library, generally far the largest 
collection of books he has ever seen, is frequently the germ of that 
bookishness characteristic of literary workers. Forbid the gratifica- 
tion of this curiosity and you may stifle a taste that would otherwise 
bring culture to its possessor. 
The difficulties in the way of granting free access to the shelves are 
so obvious as to be generally overestimated in the case of smaller

freedom of shelves is granted to advanced students and to those 
specially recommended by their instructors, while undergraduate needs 
are met by class room libraries and large reference collections in the 
main reading room. Often the practice of temporarily reserving books 
for a particular class, a practice primarily intended to secure equal 
rights to each member of the class, is carried to such an extent as to 
bring forth the entire resources of the library on a certain subject, and 
thus in part to afford the advantages of free access to the shelves.' 
Departmental libraries——The popularity of the student society 
libraries which were a marked feature of college life during the first 
half of this century, was unquestionably due to the prominence they 
gave to general literature and to the freedom of access to books they 
granted as compared with the college library. When the literary ac- 
tivity of these societies languished or ceased, it became necessary to 
protect their libraries, often more used than the college collection, by 
combining it with the latter. This union has been carried out very 
generally since the issue of the United States report on libraries in 
1876. Tle change, however, in the methods of college instruction has 
in the last ten years developed the need and existence of departmental 
and class room libraries. The wave of combination is fast followed by 
one of division. “The tendency is to make the university library to an 
increasing extent a collection of department libraries round a center 
consisting of those books to the making of which different depart- 
ments have contributed in common and which they will use in common, 
and the method of study requires free access to the books in these 
department libraries.”? This movement would make even the ordinary 
college library “a collection of department libraries containing books 
selected by the professor and instructor in that department rather than 
one library having a systematic and unifying principle of growth and 
administration.” (W.I. Fletcher, D. j.10: 268.) This necessarily leads 
to the housing in different laboratories and seminary rooms of a very 
considerable portion of the books belonging to the institution. The 
advantages thus gained may be briefly summarized as relief to the 
main library room, which rarely has the facilities both for a large num- 
ber of books and a large number of workers, greater freedom with 
diminished danger from misplacement of books, and assurance of the 
personal aid and instruction of professors in their use. (Edith E. 
Clarke, L. j. 14: 340; D. j. 14: 464; 15: ¢ 143.) 
The movement is so general that its dangers, specially in case of unen- 
dowed libraries, demand a fuller statement. They appear twofold; on 
the practical side, the cost and difficulty in successfully maintaining

*Edwin H. Woodruff, librarian of Leland Stanford Junior University, in a paper 
entitled ‘‘Some present tendencies in university libraries,” read before the Inter- 
uational Congress of Librarians at Chicago, July 14, 1893.

separately housed and rapidly growing collections of books, selected by 
as many different persons; on the theoretic side, the lessening of the 
importance and influence of the central library as a humanizing factor 
in college life and as a unifying force in the different fields of intellectual 
pursuit.'. In case volunteer assistance equal to that of trained library 
attendants is forthcoming from the various departments served, the first 
objection is met in great measure. There still remains the difficulty of 
securing a symmetrical growth of the different collections without 
impairing the efficiency of the central library by unduly stinting its 
purchases. With the increased use of the department libraries it is 
inevitable that the demand for duplicates will be more and more based 
on convenience rather than necessity, while the fields of knowledge not 
at any one period the subject of study will be temporarily neglected, 
unless the librarian shows unusual foresight and persistence. 
While many believe there is no time in college for what is known as 
a desultory use of books, all agree that it is the time to learn how to 
read and what toread. (R. R. Bowker, Z. j. 2:60.) Now, the central 
library must possess a preeminence, not alone in size, but in attractive- 
ness, if this object is to be accomplished. The student must find in it 
not only that scanty “literature of power” which will elude many a 
departmental division of books, but also a first-class selection from the 
boundless “literature of knowledge.” Otherwise his mind, however 
sharpened and trained by his special studies, will unconsciously learn 
to forego the pleasure of investigating the miscellaneous topics that 
have momentarily aroused its curiosity, since this involves the use, it 
may be, of a dozen different departmental libraries, all more or less 
unfamiliar to him. If, as has been recently said, our universities are 
dominated by the scientific spirit, it is the more needful that the cen- 
tral university library by its inclusiveness, symmetry, and influence 
should represent the spirit of liberal culture, not as the antagonist, but 
as the end and aim of specializing study.” 
  
1That there is great danger of thus neglecting a central library may appear from 
the following extract from the sixteenth annual report of the president of Johns 
Hopkins University. “* * * Thesum of $2,000 given to the university by William 
A. Slater, esq., of Norwich, Conn., has been expended in the purchase of costly books, 
not absolutely essential to our daily work, but of great attraction to students. The 
most of the purchases were in English literature, and among them were the best 
library editions of Shakespeare, Beaumont, and Fletcher, and other dramatists, 
Ascham, Milton, Evelyn, Johnson, Dryden, Pope, Scott, Wordsworth, Coleridge, 
Goldsmith, Lamb, Browning, Tennyson, Lowell, Longfellow, Whittier, and other 
writers. * * *” The average college, specially if lecated in a country town, can 
not afford to wait for a special gift to place on its shelves the best library editions of 
leading authors in English literature. 
2 There are two ways of combining the obvious advantages of both plans. One, 
too expensive to be practical unless in very rare cases, is to incur the heavy cost of 
having both central and department libraries complete by the free brying of dupli- 
cates. The other is to make the library the center of the university grounds, and 
put the cluster of department libraries, with their seminars, in rooms adjoining the

Instruction in bibliology.—Since Mr. Emerson made his famous 
demand on the colleges for a professorship of books and reading, and 
specially since the publications of the Bureau of Education have shown 
what has been done in this direction and how it may best be done, few 
college libraries have failed to make some attempt, either through the 
librarian or interested members of the faculty, to give instruction in the 
use of books. These attempts have necessarily been informal and 
largely spasmodic. Hardly a dozen institutions provide to-day system- 
atic courses of instruction in bibliology.'| This is due partly to pressure 
of other work on the librarian, partly to the inability of the college to 
find or pay a proper salary to a “good encyclopedic adviser in the flesh, 
ever ready, alluring in manner, and with an enthusiasm for his work.” 
(Justin Winsor, Z. j.3:120.) All professional librarians, however, fully 
realize the need both of formal lectures and of that hand to hand, face 
to face instruction in the library itself, by which methods Of investiga- 
tion are taught, experience gained, and enthusiasm communicated. 
Quiet but effective work of this character is done in many colleges.’ : 
Subject catalogs.—As a rule, college librarians feel it incumbent 
on them.to supply a subject as well as an author catalog. So laborious 
and expensive is this task, when carried out with the elaborateness 
practiced in larger libraries, that many have envied rather than imitated 
catalogs such as the College of New Jersey issued in 1884 and the Uni- 
versity of California in 1890. Of Jate a prominent librarian has repeat- 
edly expressed his conviction that this costly key to the resources of a 
growing library must be given up The argument against its use in 
the college or university library is, briefly, this: It is harmful to the 
ordinary student, who, using it without discrimination, often selects 
from the numerous titles cited obsolete or misleading books. To the 
specialist it fails to present the entire resources of the library on any 
subject, since it does not analyze and include many serial publications, 
In particular, it fails to mention. the existence of important works not 
in the library. For the former a printed finding list of a picked collee- 
  
general library and surrounding it as a center. This would enable the students in 
each seminar room to use the general books and the readers of the general library to 
reach anything in a department library by merely passing to an adjoining room, 
This plan requires that the space next the main library shall not be used for admin- 
istration, museum, general recitation, or any other purposes not requiring immediate 
contact with the library, sinco the space on every side will be none too much to pro- 
vide for seminar rooms and professors’ studies in the great field of study of which 
the library is the laboratory where both professors and students must constantly 
work.—M. D.

tion of 5,000 or 10,000 books of recognized merit will be more useful. 
The latter will find more complete and accurate guidance in printed 
bibliographies.! 
The subject catalog, in its development and almost universal use, is 
peculiarly American, and the views just expressed have yet to win 
general adoption on this side the Atlantic. (Justin Winsor, LZ. j. 8: 33; 
16: 214.) They serve, however, to emphasize the need of careful anno- 
tation of the subject catalogs in our college libraries by or under 
direction of the various professors, and the frequent reference to such 
separate bibliographies and bibliographic guides as the library has. 
Many earnest advocates of a subject catalog would doubtless advise a 
college library mainly composed of recent books to check up an inter- 
leaved copy of Sonnenschein’s “ Best books” with its location marks, 
rather than attempt to make a subject catalog, whenever the latter 
course would unquestionably restrict the amount available for future 
purchases. The extent to which the printed dictionary catalogs of other 
libraries may be made to serve as a substitute for a subject catalog is 
seldom fully appreciated in smaller libraries. The recently completed 
catalog of the Peabody Institute, Baltimore, is well adapted for this 
use. The task of entering on the margins the location marks of the 
volumes possessed by a small college library is largely mechanical and 
can be intrusted to any careful student helper. Entering on the inter- 
leayed pages subject references to specially important new books will 
not unduly burden the librarian himself, specially if he secures the coop- 
eration of interested members of the faculty. Such a subject catalog 
being mainly in print can be used even more conveniently than a card 
catalog when the number of those who consult it is limited. 
Library privileges.—Nearly all college libraries during the last 
twenty years have extended the privileges granted undergraduates. 
The spirit that restricted a freshman to one book and a sophomore to 
two books each half term has practically disappeared. In 1877 it would 
appear that 1 in 7 of the college libraries were not open daily; the pro- 
portion now is only 1 in 40, while over one-half are open upward of thirty 
hours a week. Then, as a rule, the professors only could make the col- 
lection a direct aid in their studies; now, by means of reserved books 
and long library hours, the privilege is extended to all students. The 
very few university libraries that do not lend books to undergraduates 
provide every facility for their consultation in the building. 
Many libraries still fail to allow an undergraduate to borrow for a 
limited time all the books he needs on a definite subject. Why this 
privilege, granted as a matter of course to teachers, should be refused 
to learners, is not entirely clear. The usual argument, liability to abuse, 
may be met by the obvious reply that it is in the power of the adminis- 
tration to prevent such abuse. A charging system that maintains an 
1 This argument is fully and ably stated by C: H: Bull in Subject catalogs in col- 
lege libraries; in Library Journal, 15: 167.   
 
-P-A-G-E-939
  THE WORLD'S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 929 
account with both book and borrower, and registers requests for books 
not found on the shelves, enables the librarian to ascertain just when 
liberal loans to one individual affect the efficiency of the library for 
others. (Justin Winsor, Z. j. 3: 338.) In several libraries any under- 
graduate is allowed, on written application approved by the librarian, 
to borrow for a short period a number of specified books on a definite 
subject in addition to the usual number allowed him. In a small col- 
lege, or wherever the rules provide for recall of books specially needed, 
this plan works successfully. 
The period of usefulness of each book added to the library is in a 
certain sense limited. The time necessary for an individual to make 
the proper use of that book is also limited. Rules about circulation 
should have regard to these limitations. The rule or practice so often 
met of allowing professors to keep books without a time limit antago- 
nizes this principle, and almost invariably leads to abuse. (Melvil 
Dewey, L. j.4: 448.) It has arisen from the fact that certain books are 
of more use to the professor than to anyone else. These books, how- 
ever, are so few in number that their withdrawal should be an excep- 
tion to the rules, rather than that the rules should be framed to cover 
the exception. 
The gradual abandonment of the practice of attaching the librarian- 
ship to some college chair has given the undergraduate another privi- 
lege, that of having a librarian. With some very marked exceptions, 
the librarian under the old régime was for the teachers rather than the 
students. With so much of his thought and energies engrossed with 
other duties, he was necessarily a custodian rather than a dispenser of 
books. The opportunity of consulting and enjoying the personal aid 
and direction of a librarian of mature judgment, wide experience, and 
full acquaintance with the collection under his charge, is a boon each 
college should strive to afford its students. The need and the difficulty 
of securing this in every case are too obvious to require further state- 
ment. (T. K. Davis, L. j.10: 100.) Not least among the new privileges 
afforded college students is that resulting from the growth of the belief 
that library buildings must be constructed for readers as well as for 
books. Another article! discusses problems of library architecture, 
and the college librarian should be acquainted with the facilities offered. 
by the new buildings at Cornell University, and at Hartford Theological 
Seminary, as well as with the plans of the proposed additions to Gore 
Hall at Harvard. (L.j. 14: 121, 264.) 
Devices for popularizing the library.—Of various devices for popu- 
Jarizing a library several are specially helpful in a college library. One, 
1J|ness of the author caused the omission of this important article. Reference 
is made to his paper on “ Points of agreement in library architecture” (L. j. 16: 
Ci7-19), and to the two special works on library buildings, which the editor of this 
volume has now in preparation; one a compact summary of the lessons of experi- 
ence, the other a full treatment of the subject.—M. D.

first used at Harvard, is thus described: “Slips of paper, headed Notes 
and queries, followed by a few words of direction, were prepared, and 
arow of hooks was arranged in a conspicuous place to hold them. A 
slip having been filled out with a question and hung up, anybody who 
possesses the information wanted answers the question on the same 
slip, or refers the inquirer to sources of information.”! In many libra- 
ries a blank book properly labeled and placed in a conspicuous position 
is found to serve nearly as well, while requiring less space. 
A. book of complaints may also prove of service. The peculiar ideas 
of honor prevailing among undergraduates prevent some of them from 
reporting in person to the librarian annoyances arising from purposely 
misplaced books, loud talking in study rooms, abstraction of current 
periodicals, and repeated failure to secure a popular book, though allow- 
ing the expression of grievances through this channel. 
Even when a library is compelled to buy frugally, it is well to solicit 
suggestions from all who use it as to books to be bought. This can be 
done by use of a blank kook exposed in a prominent place like the book 
of complaints. The advantage lies not merely in occasional discovery 
of a notable deficiency, but in the opportunity to become acquainted with 
wants and tastes of individuals making requests. Such request often 
leads to an interview in which the present resources of the library in 
that direction, its financial restrictions and the comparative merits of 
the book are so discussed as to excite rather than diminish the general 
interest of the applicant, even though his request is refused. 
The practice of regularly placing on prominent shelves the new books 
added to the library—new books seem always to find themselves read- 
ers—should be supplemented by display from: time to time of a selec- 
tion of the resources of the library on some topic of the day, or on some 
subject toward which the librarian desires to attract attention. This 
indirect method of guiding the reading of undergraduates costs little 
in time and is often as effective as more formal efforts. 
Cooperation.—Glancing at the condition of the college libraries 
throughout the entire country, one can hardly fail to be impressed with 
the restrictions that poverty places on the work many of them might 
otherwise accomplish. Of 450 institutions of higher learning in the 
United States only 200 have collections of books large enough to be 
. ranked as college libraries. Of these 200 only a third have profes- 
sional librarians. Of this third a smaller fraction are well endowed 
and organized. Till this burden of poverty is lifted it seems evident 
that the only way for a general increase in efficiency lies in wise cooper- 
ation, both with other libraries of their class and with public libraries 
in their vicinity. The obligation to help, which always comes with the 
ability, is generally acknowledged by the large and well-endowed uni- 
versity libraries. This assistance, to cite a single instance, can be ren-

dered without expense in the matter of cataloging. Nowhere is good 
cataloging more essential than in a college library. Nowhere is there 
so often a compulsory choice between buying books and properly cata- 
loging them. Yet of the new books obtained by the average library 
of this class all have just been fully and accurately cataloged by some 
university library close at hand, if one speaks from the standpoint of 
the mail service. If several smaller libraries share the expense, printed. 
or typewritten copies of these catalog cards can be secured each month 
at a fraction of the original cost. For the older books bought and the 
miscellaneous volumes given them let these same libraries, joining with 
them small public libraries in the neighborhood, group themselves 
geographically and engage a professional cataloger, who should pass 
from one to the other. Thus all accessions could be properly cataloged 
without undue delay and at far less expense than would be the case 
otherwise. The librarian, relieved of this time-consuming work, for 
which, perchance, he has neither aptitude nor training, can devote his 
energies to duties of his position previously neglected by constraint. 
Cooperative cataloging, though so often urged and so obvious a 
means of diminishing the cost of library administration, is by no means 
the only channel in which union of effort will bring increased effi- 
ciency to smaller college libraries. The practice of lending books from 
one library to another has not been developed or systematized to the 
extent it could be, were there a hearty spirit of cooperation. Its impor- 
tance and usefulness depend, of course, on a certain degree of speciali- 
zation on the part of neighboring libraries and some consideration and 
inquiry before buying expensive works. It is ashame that two colleges 
with modest book funds and only 50 miles apart should each buy a copy 
of Sargent’s Silva of North America, and neither be able to supply an 
jnquirer with Scudder’s Butterflies of the Eastern United States. It 
may happen that the institutions in one State can make a single set of 
the Transactions of the Royal Society of Great Britain serve them all. 
This mode of cooperation is specially advantageous in case of the pub- 
lishing societies. In the department of English, for instance, no small 
college can afford to buy the issues of the Philological, Early Eng- 
lish Text, New Shakespeare, Spenser, and Browning societies, and yet 
by agreement with its neighbors it is possible for each professor of 
English literature to have a complete set of one of them at hand, as 
well as access to all the others at slight expense. 
By specializing on State and local history a group of college libraries 
may supply themselves with sufficient and suitable material for original 
work in American history. Let each turn over from its accessions all 
that belongs to the field assigned another, thus securing special rights 
as a future borrower. Students from the various towns can be inter- 
ested in collecting municipal reports and local publications. Others 
will be willing to undertake the compilation of scrapbooks containing 
all historical and biographic matter of note that appears in local papers.
-P-A-G-E-942
  932 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Such a course systematically followed for a score of years by a dozen 
cooperating libraries in any section of the country would give the 
teachers and the students in the smallest of these colleges better facili- 
ties in the manner of completeness of historical matter than is now 
offered by the largest. 
The department of bibliography, in which the university libraries 
have already done much elaborate work, is also one in which much 
more can be accomplished by joint action. The need as well as the 
demand for books like Adams’s Manual of Historical Literature is ever 
increasing. Such work must be revised so frequently that it is unlikely 
to be undertaken and kept up to date from merely commercial consid- 
erations. Is it not, however, practicable so to apportion the field that 
the colleges of the United States may together give their under- 
graduates and the public simple statements in print of the scope and 
comparative merits of those books in English that are most used and 
best adapted for affording information in each of the departments 
represented in their curricula? Much that has already been done could 
be used, or by reference made more widely known, and, most important 
of all, provision could be made for the future revision and issue of these 
lists. No one library can and no publisher will do this. But all col- 
lege libraries have daily use for such a series of brief annotated bibli- 
ographies and together are able, through the men whose services they 
can secure, to prepare and to publish them.! 
The college library and the public library.—If the proprietary 
library is the parent of the free public library, college and school 
libraries may justly claim rank as paternal and maternal grandparents.” 
Though, as often happens on this side the Atlantic, the child has out- 
stripped its ancestors in size and importance, and has occasionally 
forced them to follow rather than lead in new and improved methods, 
still friendly, if not filial, relations must be maintained. When they 
exist side by side in the same town one can easily supplement the work 
of the other. Few would claim that the college student should be 
denied access to the popular literature of the day; all agree that it must 
not be too accessible. The college library can, therefore, leave this field 
1At the Chicago meeting, where this paper was read, the A. L. A. publishing sec- 
tion was reorganized and is actively engaged in several enterprises such as is here 
suggested, and proposes to organize others as fast as the demand and support of 
librarians justify. Tull information of the work of the section and of the different 
publications in preparation can be had from the president, Melvil Dewey, State 
library, Albany, N. Y.—M. D. 
To those who have read Otis H. Robinson’s report on cooperative college catalog- 
ing, in Library Journal, 1: 434—to cite but one out of many references that might be 
made—it is obvious that these suggestions are by no means novel. College librarians 
as individuals, however, have had so prominent a part in the cooperative work 
accomplished since 1880 that it seems proper to urge on college librarians as a class 
the need of organized effort in the same direction.

to be entirely supplied by its neighbor. On the other hand, the public 
library should be encouraged by the college library to refer to it school 
teachers and all persons of studious tastes who find its collection too 
limited for their needs. The college, through the librarian and pro- 
fessors, can increase its efficiency as an educational factor by lectures 
or informal talks, setting forth its resources in the departments they 
represent (L. j. 12: 253; 16: 214), The use of a university library as a 
semipublic reference library is in strict accord with the general purpose 
for which the institution was founded (Otis H. Robinson, L. j. 2: 57). 
It is surely to their credit that a recent traveler has written that in 
America the college libraries offer the best facilities for literary work 
on the premises. In large cities it sometimes happens that the relative 
position of the college and the public library is reversed. The latter 
from its age and large income can supply all that the collegian requires, 
save a carefully selected collection of reference books in connection 
with his recitation rooms. 
If the process of sifting or weeding out public libraries, discussed in 
another chapter,’ is generally adopted, it becomes specially desirable 
that each university library should have the privilege of selecting cer- 
tain classes of books; for instance, text-books used in the past in the 
institution, writings of its alumni, reports of charitable bodies useful 
in sociologic study, before these are consigned to the auction room, 
In return for such gifts, temporary loans may be made during the con- 
tinuance of university extension lectures of scientific and expensive 
books which would not otherwise be obtainable. In a word, the spirit 
of mutual helpfulness is alike necessary and profitable if the two classes 
of libraries are to attain to their ideal.

The importance of the careful consideration of fiction, especially in 
free public libraries, is never questioned. It was discussed at length 
at the first meeting of the A. L. A. in Philadelphia in 1876 (Z. j. 1: 96, 
98); also at the first meeting of the L. A. U. K., London, 1877 (ZL. j. 
2: 255); and again at the Boston conference of the A. L. A. in 1879, 
when a number of valuable papers were contributed (LZ. j. 4: 319). It 
is the subject of a report of the cooperation committee (L. j. 7: 28), and 
of a symposium (L. j, 15: 261-64; 16: 8-10). Magazines and periodicals 
are constantly publishing articles on the various relations of libraries 
and librarians to the reading and supply of fiction; the Library jour- 
nal alone in its 16 volumes indexes over 120 articles and paragraphs. 
Criticisms by men of letters and by educators which are everywhere 
met in print are not to be ignored by the library profession; no presi- 
dent’s address at any meeting of library association or club fails to 
touch feelingly this important subject; and speakers at the opening of 
libraries always point the moral and utter the note of warning. Books

and pamphlets in great number and of no little value have been pub- 
lished, and, indeed, it would at first seem impossible to gain from this 
mass of material the fair judgment of the majority. After carefully 
reading some hundreds of books, pamphlets, articles, and letters on the 
subject, and considering the opinions brought out in the discussion of 
this and kindred topics at the A. L. A. Chicago meeting, I present the 
following as a fair deduction, not affected by my own feelings or opinions. 
Value of fiction.—The utterance is almost as one voice that fiction is 
of the greatest value in developing a taste for reading, but is most cer- 
tainly injurious unless of good quality, or if the reading of that class 
of literature is indulged in exclusively. It is agreed that false literary 
taste in the young may by judicious direction be corrected, but that in 
adults the effect of bad reading is almost ineradicable. It is urged that 
everyone should be familiar with the great works of imagination, and 
the fact is pointed out that nearly all the greatest—the immortal— 
literature of the world is fiction. 
The educational value of the novel is maintained. It is claimed that 
the imagination is the_first faculty that should be developed in child: 
hood, but it is believed, however, that the reading of stories by chil- 
dren should be largely in connection with their studies and under their 
teachers’ direction. In particular the educational value of the historical 
novel and the travel story is emphasized as helping to fix in the reader’s 
mind the facts of history, and as giving vivid and enduring pictures of 
remote times and places. Such books are admitted to libraries from 
which romantic fiction is excluded. 
It is, however, chiefly as “ pastime reading” that fiction is demanded, 
and the argument for its supply by the public library runs mainly as 
follows: The majority of people are busy so many hours of the day that 
when they have time to read they have little strength for such reading 
as may task the brain. Reading is at once the most elevating and 
refining of all pastime, and people have the same right to it that they 
have to recreation in the public parks. While a librarian should try 
to guide his readers judiciously from lighter fiction to that of the best 
class, and also to works of more serious character, it is deemed dis- 
tinetly his duty to furnish entertaining reading matter to his public. 
The function of the public library becomes more and more educa- 
tional, and it is interesting to note an advance toward the radical wing 
of the division. Many librarians in their published writings, as well as 
in their recent letters to me on this subject, acknowledge that their 
theories and practices are becoming more strict since they do not find 
the necessity laid on them to provide a great deal of light entertain- 
ment for their public. 
At the same time the value of the novel as a proper means of rest 
and relaxation after severe mental or physical toil is constantly urged. 
It is contended, however, that this may be provided in ample quantity 
without the admission of novels questionable from the strict literary or

moral standpoint. Many writers on this subject deprecate the exces- 
sive reading of even the best novels, believing that in most cases it is 
only an excuse for mental laziness, and that it weakens the power of 
serious study and application, and unfits for the higher duties of life. 
Schopenhauer remarks that “ feeble writing unfits us for stronger food.” 
From this point the argument leads naturally to the extreme view that 
public libraries should draw the line absolutely at what is believed to 
be of educational value. 
Quality of fiction supplied.—Regarding the literary quality of the 
fiction which a public library should supply opinions vary from ‘admit 
whatever is called for” to “exclude the works of all living novelists 
while admitting very few by the dead ones,” but the great and reason- 
able majority reaffirms the theory that ‘it is best to avoid the lowest 
classes of books and. to keep up a high standard.” <A large provision 
of trashy fiction is not necessary to draw the public to the library; 
indeed only a very small minority expresses itself in favor of this 
practice, which would find its only excuse in proving that this kind of 
literature is the most entertaining. The point is made that much fiction 
which is light and entertaining is, at the same time, of excellent liter- 
ary quality. The pertinent question is asked, “Why should a different 
literary standard be applied to fiction than to other classes of books in 
the selection of which the greatest care is taken, and the opinions and 
criticism of experts sought in order that the best books may be chosen 
for library lists?” Also, “ Since even thé largest libraries must select, 
as they can not buy all the novels published, why not select the best?” 
There is much testimony to show that the public likes the best 
books, and will read them when provided. One writer says, “Supply 
fiction liberally, but at the start furnish only the higher grades, adding 
sensational books sparingly to catch certain classes of readers when it 
is found impossible to attract them otherwise.” That libraries should 
be obliged to furnish books which they would, for sound reasons, 
otherwise reject “in order to gain the public support that comes from 
an extended use of the library” would seem unfortunate, and a distinct 
degradation of the purpose of the library, that of public benefactor. 
The moral aspect of the question provokes little discussion, and that 
mainly in treating of translations. Feeling unquestionably favors ad- 
mitting in the original much which would be excluded in translation, 
always on the ground that this is necessary to the study of foreign lit- 
erature, and that the books will be mainly used for such study. The 
universal opinion is that as far as possible all evil should be kept from 
the young. 
Quantity of fiction supplied.—This varies, according to answers to 
my circular letter, from 10 to 45 per cent of the whole number of vol- 
umes in the library. The average is 24, which is somewhat larger than 
the 20 per cent advised in starting new libraries. The percentage 
allowed by the committee for the A. L. A. library was only 16,
-P-A-G-E-946
  936 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
The library making the largest provision for fiction reports the largest 
yearly issue of fiction. Exactly the same fact was observed by Mr. T. 
Mason in determining the average per cent circulation of fiction in 25 
libraries of Great Britain, and is noted in his report (L. j. 15: 265-66). 
Fifteen per cent of the money allowed for buying books is believed to 
be ample for fiction, these publications being usually of low prices and 
large discounts. 
Selection.—This is not usually, and probably should never be, left 
wholly to the librarian, as this involves undue responsibility. In most 
cases purchase lists are made up by the librarian from reviews, aided 
by requests and suggestions. from readers.  ‘¢ Books called for” are noted 
in a blank-book or on slips giving publisher, price, and, whenever possi- 
ble, reliable criticism, and are usually signed by the person making the 
request; duplicates wanted are indicated in the same way. These lists 
are approved and should always be signed by a trustee, and preserved, 
in order that the librarian may be protected from adverse criticism. 
Direction of fiction reading.—This is not often attempted except 
through the annotated catalogs and lists, and by preparing lists and 
bulletins of ‘“‘Best novels,” “ Historical novels,” ete, Bulletins of care- 
fully selected and annotated books suitable to various school grades are 
constantly appearing. Personal effort by librarians is usually judi- 
ciously limited to such as is requested by readers er by parents and 
guardians. In small towns or communities the librarian becomes the 
acquaintance and friend to whom the reader naturally turns for advice, 
when the conditions become quite different from those existing in the 
general public library, where the keeper and distributor of books can 
not be held responsible for the moral and intellectual well-being of the 
community. Common-sense and tact must direct in this as in all 
departments of library work. 
Classification.—Fiction is almost always alphabeted under authors’ 
names, and Cutter book numbers are generally used. Fiction suited 
to the young is sometimes separated from other for convenience in 
delivering books, and should always be indicated by some sign on the 
outside of the book which will serve as instruction to attendants in 
selecting suitable books for young readers. 
Fiction catalogs.—These are usually both author and title lists; if 
only one can be provided, the title list is preferred. Whenever possible, 
lists should be annotated. Very brief notes indicate place and period 
treated in historical novels, or subject and scope of the “Tendenz- 
Roman,” and these add greatly to the value of the catalog, whether 
printed or on cards. The little time and labor required to prepare 
these notes will be repaid many-fold. Happily much good work of this 
kind is already at the service of the librarian or cataloger, and much 
more is promised in the near future. Fiction lists which are not anno- 
tated should be accompanied by a comprehensive list of “best novels” 
as a guide to those wishing to read the best, together with references

to Boston, Philadelphia, and other ‘“ Historical fiction” lists, Griswold’s 
“Descriptive lists,” etc. 
It would not be just to omit from this consensus of opinion the report 
of William Kite, librarian of Friend’s free library, of Germantown, 
Pa., the only public library reporting to me which admits no novels. 
This report gives assurance that, after persevering for twenty years in 
its extreme radical course, the library stands in its community as the 
exponent of the highest benevolent and educational ideas, and the man- 
agement sees no reason to change its attitude on the fiction question.

REGULATIONS FOR READERS. 
By W. H. Brerr, Cleveland (Ohio) Public Library. 
The following paper is based upon replies to a series of questions 
upon the subject, received from 110 free public libraries, 22 public 
libraries for the use of which a fee or subscription is required, 34 
libraries of colleges and other institutions of learning, 12 libraries of 
societies of various sorts, and 13 State libraries; 191 in all. 
The assignment of papers for this meeting contemplated a historic 
review of each topic for the past seventeen years, but the subjects in 
regard to which rules are framed are so various that.the most which 
 
-P-A-G-E-950
  940 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
ean be attempted is a brief survey of library practice. I think I may 
fairly say, however, from such information as I can gather, that while 
the changes that have occurred in that time have been few, so far as 
they have been made they have been in the direction of greater liber- 
ality. 
A. general free public library in a large city, comprising both a refer- 
ence and a circulating department, comprehends within the scope of its 
work every phase of library activity. It includes upon its shelves, 
more or less fully, the whole range of human knowledge, and it meets 
so far as possible the wants of all classes of people. In framing its 
rules it is necessary to consider almost every possible problem in library 
economy. 
The discussion of a comprehensive code of rules for a public library 
would include, therefore, every condition likely to confront the librarian 
of any library. I can at this time only attempt to present to you a 
résumé of the rules now governing many of the public libraries of this 
country, some brief notice of the variations therefrom in other classes 
of libraries, and the suggestion of a few questions which may be fairly 
regarded as open for discussion. 
Library rules naturally fall under two heads: First, the qualifications 
of the reader; second, methods in the library; or, in other words, they 
answer the questions: Who shall use the library? How shall he use it? 
QUALIFICATIONS. 
The qualifications usually regarded are as follows: 
Residence.—Most libraries issue books for home use to the resi- 
dents of the town or city only. In a few cases it is extended to the 
county, and in one instance, a radius of 10 miles is mentioned as the 
limit. The use of many free endowed libraries is limited to the com- 
munity which is the recipient of the beneficence, and the prevailing 
practice among those supported by public funds is to limit the use to 
the territory taxed for its support. A small number of libraries, 
among them some supported by taxation, extend all their privileges to 
all within their reach. 
Age.—Most libraries fix an age before which a child may not draw 
books. In 31 libraries from which I have heard, the limit is 12 years, 
in 24 it is 14 years, in 12 10 years, in a few others ages varying from 6 
to 16. In 22 no age was fixed, but the qualification was variously 
stated as “ability to read,” “to use a book properly,” or “to write one’s 
name.” : 
Responsibility.—This is usually stated about as follows: “Persons 
known to the librarian, or satisfactorily vouched for in writing.” This 
rule is almost universal, as is also that of accepting a deposit of money 
varying from $2 to $5, and in a few cases even more, in lieu of a guar- 
antee. 
The foregoing applies only to those who wish to draw books for home 
use. In a few libraries similar restrictions apply to the use of reference
-P-A-G-E-951
    THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 941 
departments and reading rooms. In most libraries, however, these are 
practically open to all, the only qualification being proper behavior. 
RULES. FOR LIBRARY MANAGEMENT. 
These relate to the hours of opening, favilities for the selection and 
use of books in the library, and for their issue. This subject can not 
be treated fully without trenching on other fields, but this will be done 
only so far as necessary. 
Library hours.—Usage varies greatly. Libraries of the larger cities 
are usually open twelve hours each week-day, the time of opening vary- 
ing from 8 to 10 o’clock a. m., and of closing from 9 to 10 p.m. In some 
libraries the reference department is open longer than the circulating 
department. 
Sunday and holiday opening.—In most of the larger and some of 
the smaller libraries, the reference and reading rooms are open on Sun- 
day afternoon and evening, in a few instances for the afternoon only, 
and in three libraries of which I am informed these departments are 
open in the forenoon also. <A few libraries keep the circulating depart- 
ment open on Sunday. The smaller libraries throughout the country, 
specially in New England, generally close. The reply to the question 
in regard to this was usually accompanied by the remark that it was 
not desired nor needed, and occasionally by an adverse opinion as to 
its propriety. The experience of many libraries covers a period of from 
ten to twenty years or more, so that it can not be regarded as an experi- 
ment. ‘Those librarians who have had experience almost unanimously 
favor opening reading and reference rooms on Sunday afternoons and 
evenings, and with equal unanimity regard it as unnecessary to open 
the circulating department. 
In some of the larger and a few smaller libraries the reference and 
reading rooms, and in two or three instances the circulating depart- 
ment also, are opened on holidays. Two or three libraries report it as 
their practice to close on Christmas, the universal holiday, and Fourth 
of July, the national one, and to open on all others. 
The whole question of library hours during the week, and of Sunday 
and holiday opening, is purely a local one, in which uniformity is 
neither possible nor desirable. Each library must conform to the needs 
of its own locality. 
Selection of books.—Most public libraries have printed or card 
catalogs, or both, to assist readers in selecting books. Besides this a 
small number permit general access to the shelves in the circulating 
department, for the examination and selection of books. In about 55 
per cent such access is entirely prohibited, and in the remainder, or 
about 45 per cent, although prohibited generally, exceptions are made. 
These exceptions are variously stated as being in favor of “professional 
men,” “ministers,” “teachers,” “students,” or as being ‘ occasional” 
or ‘for sufficient reason.” Views as to its desirability differ widely. 
 
-P-A-G-E-952
  942 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
The opinion of those librarians where access is permitted are with a 
single exception favorable, some enthusiastically so. It is curious to 
note that to a large extent the favorable opinion seems to be based 
on experience, and the unfavorable on a lack of it. 
In the reference department the reverse of this condition prevails. 
In not less than 75 per cent of the public libraries from which I have 
information, free access is permitted to most books in the reference 
department, the exceptions noted being that special care is taken of 
fine illustrated books and of medical works. In a number of other 
libraries, the most common books of reference—as dictionaries, gazet- 
teers, cyclopedias—are placed where they can be freely used, and all 
others are given out on application. 
Reading rooms.—In a majority of libraries magazines and papers 
are placed where readers can select for themselves. In some libraries 
papers are left on files, but magazines are given out from the desk and 
areceipt taken. Ina very few libraries only are both papers and maga- 
zines given out in this way. 
Issue of books, borrowers’ cards.—More than 90 per cent of those. 
public libraries furnishing information require a card of membership to 
be presented each time a book is drawn or returned. On most of these 
an entry is made, usually the date of issue and return, and in a few 
‘cases the book number also. In a few cases only no entry is made. 
‘About one-fourth of those libraries adopting this plan make exceptions 
‘and permit books to be issued occasionally on a temporary slip or 
‘memorandum. In the others the rule is, presumably, rigidly enforced. 
‘About 10 per cent do not require membership cards. 
Number of books.—The general practice is to issue one volume at 
a time on a card, except that two or more volumes of the same set are 
issued as one book. In a few libraries two, and in one case three, 
books are regularly issued at one time on one card. Frequent excep- 
tions, however, are noted to this rule, in which additional volumes are 
issued to students. The rules very generally allow additional volumes 
to teachers. 
Time of issue.—The time for which books are issued is generally 
fourteen days, with the privilege of one renewal for the same period. 
In some cases the renewal is for one-half the original period, and very 
rarely no renewalis permitted. Ina few cases books are issued directly 
for three or four weeks and no renewal permitted. One very common 
exception to the fourteen-day rule is the issue of new books for seven 
days only and of magazines for seven days or less, both without privi- 
lege of renewal. In some libraries it is necessary to bring the books 
in for renewal; in others a personal request or one by mail will be 
attended to. 
In some libraries the rule requires that all books be returned on or 
before a certain time, for an annual examination, during which the 
library is closed.

Fines.—The current rate of fine for overdetention is 2 cents for each 
day. In a few cases this is 1 cent or 3, and in one instance only, 5. 
Rarely the fine is assessed by the week, at 10 or 25 cents. 
MISCELLANEOUS RULES. 
Rules requiring proper behavior and forbidding the use of tobacco 
are almost universal, as are those which forbid copying or tracing of 
illustrations without permission, or the use of ink at the tables. Can- 
vassing or the display of advertisements is also forbidden. 
A-rule which occurs in some codes requires the borrower to notify 
the librarian promptly if a case of contagious disease occurs in the 
household of which he is a member, and to retain the book until a 
proper disposition can be made of it. 
Some of the larger libraries have formulated codes of rules for the 
library assistants. The only ones which have come under my notice 
which affect the users of the library, even indirectly, is one which for- 
bids conversation of a personal nature, and another which restricts the 
privileges of the assistant as a borrower of new books. 
Subscription libraries.—The practice in public libraries requiring 
the payment of a fee varies little from that of other public libraries, 
except in that particular. There is apparently somewhat greater free- 
dom permitted in the library, as about one-half of the libraries from 
which I have information permit unrestrained access to the shelves. 
The libraries of secret and other socities are practically subscription 
libraries. Among the Y. M. C. A. libraries of which I am informed, 
one is a free circulating and reference library, another is a free library, 
for reference only, and a third charges a small fee in its circulating 
department, but makes its reference department practically free, 
College libraries.—The practice in college libraries varies greatly. 
A majority are for the use of those connected with the institutions 
only. In others the privileges are extended to graduates and to pro- 
fessional men or special students, and a few are free to all who wish to 
use them. Some libraries issue books for home use to members of the 
faculty only, limiting their use by students to the library rooms, but 
generally they are issued to both students and professors. The hours 
of opening are generally less than those of public libraries, only about 
one-third being open evenings. More than one-half the libraries from 
which I have information permit general access to the shelves, and in 
most in which the practice does not prevail members of the faculty 
invariably have the freedom of the shelves, and permission is granted 
to the students for any sufficient reason. Most college libraries which _ 
issue books fix a definite period for which they may be kept, and assess 
a fine for their overdetention, as in public libraries. 
State libraries.—These vary so widely in their scope and methods 
that no general statement of these rules can be attempted from the 
data at hand.

  - 944 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
READING OF THE YOUNG. 
CaRoLInE M. Hewins, Hartford Public Librarian. 
In the Government report on libraries, 1876, the relation of public 
libraries and the young was treated by Mr. W. I. Fletcher, who dis- 
cussed age-restrictions, direction of reading, choice of books, and inci- 
dentally the relation of libraries to schools, referring to librarians and 
- trustees as “the trainers of gymnasts who seek to provide that which 
will be of greatest service to their men.” The report was suggestive, 
and called for several radical changes in the usual management of 
libraries. No statistics were given, for none had been called for, and 
the number of libraries which were working in the modern spirit was 
not large. Mr. Green, in his paper at the Philadelphia conference of 
1876 (L. j. 1: 74), gave some suggestions as to how to teach school boys 
and girls the use of books, and in one or two of the discussions the 
influence of a librarian on young readers was noticed, but the Ameri- 
can Library Association did not give much time to the subject till the 
Boston conference of 1879, when a whole session was devoted to schools, 
libraries, and fiction (L. j. 4: 319), the general expression of opinion 
being similar to the formula expressed in the paper by Miss Mary A. 
Bean, “Lessen the quantity and improve the quality.” In 1881, Mr. J. 
N. Larned, of the Buffalo Young Men’s Library, issued his pamphlet, 
“Books for young readers.” The report on “ Boys’ and girls’ reading” 
which I had the honor of making at the Cincinnati conference of 1882 
has answers from some 25 librarians to the question ““What are you 
doing to encourage a love of good reading in boys and girls?” (L. j. 
7: 182.) Several speak of special catalogs or bulletins, most of per- 
sonal interest in and friendship with young readers. One writes, “‘Give 
a popular boy a good book, and there is not much rest for that book. 
Librarians should like children.” — It was in 1883 that, by the suggestion 
and advice of our lamented friend, Frederick Lypoldt, I published a 
little classified pamphlet, “‘Books for the young.” In January of the 
same year the Library Journal began a department of “Literature for 
the young,” which was transferred at the end of the year to the Pub- 
lishers’ Weekly, where it still remains. The report on the subject, made 
for the Buffalo conference by Miss Bean, is on the same lines as the 
former one, with the addition of the experience of some smaller libra- 
ries. She says, “I believe the Lynn library has hit a fundamental 
truth, and applied the sovereign remedy, so far as the question con- 
cerns public libraries, in its ‘one-book-a-week’ rule for pupils of the 
schools.” 
Miss Hannah P. James’s report at the Lake George conference in 1885 
(Z. j. 10: 278) sums up the information received from 75 sources in some 
suggestions for work in connection with school and home, suggesting 
the publication of book lists in local papers, supervision of children’s 
reading if authority is given by parents, and the limitation of school

children’s book to one or two a week. At the St. Louis conference of 
1889 Miss Mary Sargent reported on “Reading for the young” (L. j. 
14: 226). One librarian fears that lists of books prepared for boys and 
girls will soon become lists to be avoided by them, on account of young 
people’s jealous suspicion of undue influence. Sargent’s “Reading for 
the young” was published just after the White Mountain conference of 
1890, and the subject was not discussed in San Francisco in 1891 or at 
Lakewood in 1892 except in relaticn to schools. 
The Ladies’ Commission on Sunday school books is at least five years 
older than the American Library Association. It has done good service 
in printing lists of books specially adapted to Unitarian Sunday schools, 
others unfitted for them only by a few doctrinal pages or sentences, and 
a third class recommended as household friends on account of their 
interests, literary value, and good tone. The Church Library Associa- 
tion stands in the same relation to Episcopal Sunday schools, recom- 
mending in yearly pamphlets: 
1 Books bearing directly on church life, history, and doctrine. 
2 Books recommended, but not distinctly church books. 
The Connecticut Ladies’ Commission has, at the request of the Con- 
necticut Congregational Club, published since 1881 several carefully 
chosen and annotated lists. 
The National Young Folks’ Reading Circle, the Chautauqua Young 
Folks’ Reading Union, and the Columbian Reading Union, the latter a 
Catholi¢ society, the others undenominational, have published good 
lists for young readers. The Catholic Church also recommends many 
recent stories for children which have no reference to doctrines or differ- 
ences in belief. 
One hundred and fifty-two out of 160 libraries have answered the 
following questions: 
1 Are your children’s books kept by themselves? 
2 Are they classified, and how? 
8 Have they a separate card catalog or printed finding list? 
4 Are they covered? 
5 Do you enforce rules with regard to clean hands? 
6 Have you an age limit, and if so, what is it? 
7 Do you allow more than one book a week on a child’s card? 
8 Are children’s cards different in color from others? 
9 What authors are most read by children who take books from your library? 
10 What methods have you of directing their reading? Have you a special assist- 
ant for them, or are they encouraged to consult the librarian and all the assistants? 
11 Have you a children’s reading room? 
Seventy-seven reply to the first question that their children’s books 
are kept by themselves, 22 that stories or other books are separate from 
the rest of the library, and 53 that there is no juvenile division. 
Three answer simply “‘ Yes” to the second question, 24 have adopted.

4 the Cutter, and 1 the Linderfelt system; 10 arrange by authors, 18 by

subjects, 4 by authors and subjects, 42 report methods of their own or 
classification like the rest of the library, and 46 do not classify children’s 
books at all. 
In answer to the third question, 6 libraries report both a separate 
eard catalog and finding list, 43 a finding list for sale or distribution, 
15 a card catalog for children, and 88 no separate list. Of the printed 
finding lists 4 are Sargent’s, 1 Larned’s, 2 Hardy’s, and 2 Miss James’s. 
The fourth question relates to covering books for children. EHighty- 
five libraries do not cover them, 30 cover some, either those with light 
bindings or others that have become soiled and worn, 35 cover all, and 
2 do not report. 
In reply to the fifth question, 45 libraries require that children’s hands 
shall be clean before they can take books from the library, or at least 
when they use books or periodicals in the building, and 50 have no such 
rules. .Others try various methods of moral suasion, including in one 
instance a janitor who directs the unwashed to a lavatory, and in 
another a fine of a few cents for a second offense. 
The sixth question, whether there is an age limit or not, brings vavri- 
ous replies. Thirty-six libraries have none, five base it on ability to 
read or write, one fixes it at 6, one at 7,and one at8. Ten libraries allow 
achild a card in his own name at 10, two at 11, forty-seven at 12, six at 
13, thirty-three at 14, four at 15, and six at 16. They qualify their 
statements in many cases by adding that children may use the cards of 
older persons, or may have themif they bring a written guarantee from 
their parents or are in certain classes in the public schools, 
Question 7 deals with the number of books a week allowed to chil- 
dren. Ninety-five libraries allow them to change a book every day; 
one (subscription) gives them a dozen a day if they wish. Fifteen 
limit them to two, and 3 to three a week, and 16 to only one. Several 
librarians in libraries where children are allowed a book a day express 
their disapproval of the custom, and one has entered into an engage- 
ment with her young readers to take 1 book in every 4 from some other 
class than fiction. Others do not answer definitely. A few libraries 
issuing two cards, or two-book cards, allow children the use of two 
books a week, if one is not a novel or story. 
Question 8 is a less important one, whether children’s cards are of a 
different color from others. There is no difference between the cards 
of adults and children in 124 libraries, except in case of school cards 
in2. In4 the color of cards for home use varies, and 4 report other 
distinctions, like punches or different charging slips. Hight do not 
charge on cards and 12 do not answer. 
With regard to question 9, ““ What authors are most read by children 
who take books from your library?” the lists vary so much in length 
that it is impossible to give a fair idea of them in a few sentences. 
Some libraries mention only two or three authors, others ten times as 
many. Miss Alcott?s name is in more lists than any other. Where
-P-A-G-E-957
  
  THE WORLD'S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 947 
only two or three authors are given, they are usually of the Alger, 
Castleman, Finley, Optic grade. These four do not appear in the 
reports from 35 libraries, where Alden, Ballantyne, Mrs. Burnett, Susan 
Coolidge, Ellis, Henty, Kellogg, Lucy Lillie, Munroe, Otis, Stoddard, 
and various fairy tales fill their places. Seven are allowing Alger, 
Castlemon, Finley, and Optic to wear out without being replaced, and ° 
soon find that books of a higher type are just as interesting to young 
readers. 
Question 10 asks what methods are used in directing children’s read- 
ing, and if a special assistant is at their service, or if they are encour- 
aged to consult the librarian and all the assistants. Many librarians 
overconscientiously say, ‘“ No methods,” but at the same time acknowl 
edge the personal supervision and friendly interest that were meant in 
the query. Only nine do not report something of this kind. Six have, 
or are about to have, a special assistant, or have already opened a 
bureau of information. Five say that they pay special attention to 
selecting the best books, 4 of the larger libraries have open shelves, 
and 2 are careful in the choice and supervision of assistants. 
In answer to question 11, 5 report special reading rooms, present or 
prospective, for children; 3 more wish that they had them, while 
others believe that the use of a room in common with older readers 
teaches them to be courteous and considerate to others. Most reading 
rooms are open to children, who sometimes have a table of their ee 
but in a few cases those nde 14 are excluded. 
My own opinion on the subjects treated in the questions are: 
1 It is easier for a librarian or assistant to find a book for a child if 
whatever is adapted to his intelligence on a certain subject is kept by 
itself, and not with other books which may be dry, out of date, or 
written for a trained student of mature mind. 
2 It is easier to help a child work up a subject if the books which 
he can use are divided into classes, not all alphabeted under authors. 
3 A separate card catalog for children often relieves a crowd at the 
other cases. A printed dictionary catalog without notes does not help 
a child. 
A public library can make no better investment than in printing a 
classified list for children, with short notes on stories illustrating his- 
tory or life in different countries, and references to interesting books 
written for older readers. Such a list should be sold for 5 cents, much 
less than-cost. 
4 The money spent in paying for the paper and time used in cover- 
ing books is just as well employed in binding, and the attractive covers 
are pleasant to look at. 
5 The books can be kept reasonably clean if children are made to 
understand that they must not be taken away, returned, or if possible, 
read with unwashed hands. City children soon begin to understand 
this if they are spoken to pleasantly and sent away without a book till 
they come back in a fit state to handle it.
-P-A-G-E-958
      948 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
6 As soon as a child can read and write he should be allowed to use 
books. A proper guarantee from parent or teacher slfould, of course, 
be required. 
7 A child in school can not read more than one story book a week 
without neglecting his work. If he needs another book in connection 
with nis:studies he should take it on a school teacher’s, or nonfiction 
card. 
8 It is best, if a child has only one book a week, for his card to be 
of a different color from others, that it may be more easily distinguished 
at the charging desk. 
9 It has been proved by actual experiment that children will read 
books which are good in a literary sense if they are interesting. New 
libraries have the advantage over old ones, that they are not obliged 
to struggle against a demand for the boys’ series that were supplied in 
large quantities fifteen or twenty years ago. 
10 As soon as children learn that in a library there are books and 
people to help them on any subject, from the care of a sick rabbit to a 
costume for the Landing of the Pilgrims, they begin to ask advice 
about their reading. It is a good thing if some of the library assist- 
ants are elder sisters in large families who have tumbled about among 
books, and if some of the questions asked of applicants for library 
positions relate to what they would give boys or girls to read. If an 
assistant in a large library shows a special fitness for work with chil- 
dren, it is best to give itinto her charge. If all the assistants like it, 
let them have their share of it. 
11 The question of a children’s reading room depends on the size of 
the room for older readers, and how much it is used by them in the 
afternoons. Conditions vary so much in libraries that it is impossible 
for one to make a rule for another in this case. 
SHORT LIST OF BOOKS AND ARTICLES SUGGESTED FOR READING, 1894. 
Lists like those by Mr. Sawin, of Providence, belong to libraries and schools. The 
bibliography of children’s books, although most interesting to a student, does not 
bear directly on their relation to libraries. Welsh’s Bookseller of the last century, 
Lond., 1885, and Mrs. E. C. Field’s Child and his book, Lond., 1891, with the articles 
indexed in the three volumes of Poole, are the best authorities on the subject.

_REFERENCE Books. 
By ERNEsT CusHING Ricnarpson, Librarian Princeton College. 
The ‘reference book” in current library use has three recognized 
meanings: 
1 Reference book proper, to be consulted for definite points of infor- 
mation (rather than read through), and arranged with explicit refer- 
ence to ease in finding specific facts. 
2 Books not allowed to circulate, but kept for ‘ reference only.” 
3 Books accessible to the public. 
These definitions are historically related in the fact that the reference 
book «proper, on the principles of frequency and urgency of use, and 
specially method of use, needs to be restrained from circulation; and, as 
the most prominent class of restrained books, gives name to all books 
whiclr do not circulate, including those restrained on account of special — 
value, and even other varieties of kept books. Again, from method of 
use, this class of books is most troublesome both to user and to libra- 
rian, if each one must be signed for and given out, so that it is the first 
class to compel placing books on shelves accessible to the public, and 
thus gives name to a class which may include many works not strictly 
of reference. 
POINTS OF AGREEMENT, 
1 A good collection of reference books is fundamental (a) to the 
proper accumulation of a library and (b) to its effective use. 
a The first step in founding a library is to get a suitable collection of 
bibliographic reference books—bibliographies, publishers’ and library 
eatalogs, etc. This is the way Dr. Cogswell proceeded in building the 
Astor library, and what Dr. Poole has done in the Newberry. It is 
beyond dispute the only sensible and economical way to gather a library, 
tor such works guide to the best books on a subject, the best editions, 
and the best prices. Moreover they often furnish in themselves indi- 
rectly the clue to what general works will be most useful; e. g., the 
‘periodicals indexed in Poole” have been gathered often simply because 
being indexed there they are far more useful to the public than many 
others of equal intrinsic value. This principle is capable of a much 
more systematic application than is generally made. 
b In all libraries, specially those of research (including all libraries 
at all touched with the modern library idea), the most important of all 
books, except the small number of literary masterpieces, are those 
which afford: 
1, Primary information on every subject; 2, references to where fur- 
ther information can be found. An extremely well-collected library of 
general works—history, biography, ete.—lacking good reference books 
may, quite likely, be far less useful than a rather miscellaneous one 
with good cyclopedias, dictionaries, indexes, etc. Stress is laid on this
-P-A-G-E-987
  THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 977 
circumstance since, from the fact that reference books are generally 
relatively dear per volume, the policy in medium-sized libraries is too 
generally to neglect these for ‘much called-for” travel and fiction. 
2 Wherever practicable, means should be taken to train readers to 
use reference books. This is done (a) by individual assistance to read- 
ers (see chapter by Foster); (b) by lectures, as by Dr. Poole (L. j. 8: 
51-52) and by various others, specially in college libraries; (c) by printed 
guides to the use of books (Green, Library aids, handbooks of various 
libraries, ete.) ; (d) by devices to induce practical use of the books (e. g., 
Library questions and answers, L. j. 3: 126,159). 
3 The following classes are reference books under all definitions: 
General bibliographies, general cyclopedias, general dictionaries of 
words, persons, places, or things, atlases, and general indexes. 
4 The most used reference books, with all unique and excessively 
valuable books, should be restricted in circulation or restrained alto- 
gether. 
The reasons underlying the restriction of books are (a) that they will 
be needed by others; (b) that they will be in danger of receiving injury; 
(c) that they will be in danger of doing injury. 
5 Atleast a small selection of the best reference books should be 
accessible to the public. These have come to be known as the reference 
department, and are in general usage, par excellence, reference books. 
6 That more and better reference books are needed, aud that libra- 
rians have responsibilities in their making. 
This is recognized in the special committee of the A. L. A. on cooper- 
ation (see chapter by Fletcher on Indexes). The systematic effort of 
the association has hitherto been chiefly directed to cooperation of many 
members in single works (Poole’s Index, A. L. A. indexes). This field 
is by no means filled, and one of the most practical objects for early 
future work is an index to biography (see Ford, L. j. 17: 85-86) on a 
method combining that of Poole’s Index with that of Phillips’ Diction- 
ary of Biographical Reference. An even larger field is to be found in 
cooperation by division of labor by which each librarian takes some 
larger or smaller specialty, according to his tools and energy, and makes 
this his lifelong care. This has been recognized in our A. L. A. system 
of annual reporters and particularly in this subdivided handbook. To 
carry it out each cooperator should consider his subject, or some sub- 
division of it, a perpetual specialty, should produce a monograph and 
keep it up to date, printing as opportunity occurs. As Mr. Cutter is a 
specialist on rules for cataloging and various other things, Miss Sar- 
gent on books for the young, others should take other subjects and be 
perpetually responsible for them.

POINTS STILL UNSETTLED, 
1 Shall the loan of reference books be absolutely forbidden? 
Some librarians are forbidden by terms of gift and others by their 
own law to lend any book or any reference book out of the building. 
The majority, however, who are frée from the bondage of the law, 
though under the law of righteousness make exceptions to the rule, 
which fulfill its spirit; e. g., in a library which closes at dark reference 
books may be lent one night, or less used reference books may be lent 
on condition of immediate return if wanted by someone.else. In some 
libraries periodicals are regarded as reference books, and are not lent 
at all, or lent for one, two, or three days. The sensible principle seems 
to be that, just as frequently used books which are to be read through 
are restricted in time to the shortest time (say seven days) in which they 
can be conveniently read, so reference books should be restricted to 
seven, three, one, or a fraction, and lengthened for special circumstances. 
On loan of reference books, see Madan, Bodleian lending, Oxf., 1888; 
L. j. 6: 226 (1881). ; 
2 What are the exact limits of restricted books of reference? 
Valuable books and immoral books are evidently not strictly “refer- 
ence books,” and the term “kept books,” sometimes applied to one or 
both of these, might be a better general term for restricted books, valu- 
able books, “ Facetiz,” ete. 
Books like periodicals, restricted to one to three days, are more 
nearly reference books, but are not “for reference only,” nor yet kept 
books; therefore the term “restricted books” might be used for all 
books lent for less than regular time or on special conditions of deposit, 
guarantee, etc. 
Temporary reference books, or books temporarily withdrawn from cir- 
culation for some special reason (e. g., college, school, and literary soci- 
eties’ essays and debates), are strictly reference books, but are sometimes 
called “reserved books.” 
In libraries with large, accessible reference departments, text-books, 
histories, etc., are included, which are not strictly or generally in other 
libraries regarded as reference books, and on the other hand some 
libraries circulate little-called-for books which (e. g., Savage’s Dictionary 
of Genealogy, Burke’s Peerage) in others are much in demand and 
regarded as strictly reference books. 
3 Whether books generally considered inimoral in tendency should be 
(a) circulated freely, () restricted to special application, (c) excluded 
entirely. 
The chief discussion under this relates to works which have an estab- 
lished place in literary history, and on this issue there is substantial 
agreement that there is at least a minimum number which should be 
restricted, but not excluded. Similarly on the question of erotic liter- 
ature, librarians agree in restriction, with a strong vote for substantial 
exclusion. (See chapter on Fiction by Miss Coe.)

    THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 979 
4 How far books shall be accessible to the public (Question of ref- 
erence department—access to shelves). 
_ The question is quite apart from one of circulating or not circulating. 
The largest “reference libraries” (e. g., the British Museum) have 
“Reference departments,” or books placed at the free disposition of. 
readers—a wheel within a wheel. Again, the books exposed (e. g., once 
more, the British Museum) are seldom confined to technical reference 
books. They are rather a “miniature of the whole library,” the cream 
(from the worker’s standpoint) of the whole collection, having repre- 
sentatives from every class. These are reference books in the most 
general usage of the present day. The general question of the refer- 
ence department is therefore a much broader one than that of the tech- 
nical, unquestioned reference books which it may contain, and involves 
the whole problem of access to the shelves. : 
The reference department, as now constituted, is a compromise 
between the ideal demand of readers for access to all the books and 
the recent total denial of the right of access, which, beginning in a 
laudable spirit of exact organization, grew into a spirit of red tape. 
The demand for a more general access to the shelves is being more 
and more recognized as a just one. The practical advantage to the 
student (L. j. 2: 62; 12: 184; 13: 180; 15: 20-21) or even the general 
reader (L. j. 15: C33-37) of access to and handling his books is generally 
acknowledged, though some librarians maintain the rather futile con- 
tention that readers are better and more quickly served by eatalog and 
attendant than by aimless (?) wandering among the books. The fact of 
advantage settled, it is with the modern librarian merely a question of 
“none, or some, or all.” The “none” is now eliminated by universal 
consent, and the “all” must be also dropped by libraries which have 
valuable books, leaving only the question of how many and how— 
degree and method—questions of casuistry. 
The range of this question extends from a small collection of refer- 
ence books to all but a few extra valuable or ‘“‘inexpedient” books, and 
every phase has its counterpart in actual usage. Some libraries give 
access to none, others to all but valuables. Some give access to sub- 
stantially all but fiction, others to none but fiction, and still make 
various degrees between (e. g., Patents and Fine arts). 
The difficulties in free access to shelves are: 
1 Danger of loss or mutilation of books. 
2 Danger of confusion through misplacement of books. 
Something of both must be counted on, and this constitutes a diffi- 
culty great enough to make access of everybody to everything impos- 
sible in the largest libraries, though practicable in many small ones, 
This impracticability of a very desirable thing has led to compromises 
and substitutes, the most universal of which is the reference depart-. 
ment having as large a selection as can be managed of the best working 
books, or even the best books for reading (a “library of best books,” 
 
-P-A-G-E-990
  980. EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
see Larned, Z. j, 14: 127), and having besides this fixed collection vari- 
ous features of a more or less changing character, such as collections 
of books on special topics placed in reference department when these 
subjects are specially inquired after, the “Seminary library,” where 
speeial classes of books are gathered for special classes of students, 
and now quite commonly, the ‘‘ Latest accessions,” which, placed where 
they can be looked over, satisfy the most clamorous demand of the 
general reader. 
Another compromise or substitute is admitting certain classes of 
users who will receive the greatest probable advantage and do the 
least probable harm. Sometimes this is done only when the reader is 
accompanied by a library attendant, but often it is allowed with simple 
shelf-permit. This is a common practice in college libraries, where 
professors often have free access and can grant permits to students. 
The result of endless discussion on the whole subject is that there is 
an increased number of libraries giving access to most or some classes, 
a great increase in select reference departments and increase of facili- 
ties for alcove use, and a genuine disposition to grant the broadest 
practicable access.

Besides the above references, various allusions will be found in the 
Library journal, direct or implied, in accounts of “‘ Reference libraries” 
such as the British Museum and Bodleian, the Astor, Newberry, Wat- 
kinson, ete. Moreover, the question is a live one, and information is to 
be expected in current numbers of periodicals, and it is treated in other 
papers in this volume. 
5 Finally librarians are not agreed on methods of administration of 
reference books. This, however, is one of the cases where there is lack 
of agreement on account of lack of comparison. 
The chief points are: How to protect from loss and confusion, how 
to keep accurately located, and how to preserve statistics.
-P-A-G-E-991
    
  THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 981 
A. frequent method of numbering reference books is simply to prefix 
RB or Ref. to the regular number. To protect from loss or confusion 
the fundamental means are frequent examination with shelf list, con- 
spicuous numbers on outside of books, and the use of dummies. 
The best discussion of methods for reference is Austin, D. j. 18: 
181-83 (1893); see also (method of recording use) DL. j. 15: 221 (1890), 
and (arrangement) L, j. 5: 180 (1880). 
Bibliography of reference books.—Cutter’s Rules (Wash., 1891), 
p. 128, give a sufficient list of best reference books for cataloging. Of 
reference books for public use the chief of all lists is the books of refer- 
ence in the reading room of the British Museum (Lond., ed. 1, 1871, 
ed. 3, 1889). 
This does not answer the same practical purpose as Cutter’s, on 
account of the great number and variety of books included, but in the 
latest edition the lists, arranged like Dr. Spofford’s list in the 1876 
report under various subjects, make an exceedingly useful and on the 
whole the best guide to reference books for a large library. Somewhat 
nearer to average need is the list in Wheatley, How to form a library 
(1887), pp. 91-129 and 141-173. 
To supplement these lists for the most practical uses consult the A. 
L. A. report on aids and guides; Green, 1882; Foster, 1883; Crunden, 
1886; Lane, 1887; Lane, 1889; Beer, 1890; also Green’s Library aids, 
Lane’s Indexes to best and recent reference lists in the Harvard Uni- 
versity Bibliographical contributions Nos. 17 and 29, and Carr’s Index 
to recent lists, Z. j. 8: 27-32 (1883). These with Whitney’s List of 
bibliographies in the Boston public library are the best helps for the 
average library, but the larger libraries will find the bibliographies of 
bibliographies by Petzholdt and Vallée primary. To keep lists up to 
date see bibliographic departments of the Library journal and the 
Centralblatt. 
For select lists Winsor’s reference books in English (Z. j. 1: 247-49) 
is a model of practical method and just discrimination, now partly 
but not wholly out of date. Miss Hewins (Z. j. 11: 305-8 passim) 
indicates reference books for the smallest libraries. Later lists of con- 
siderable help and varying critical value are found in works of Son- 
nenschein (Best books), Sargent (Guide book to books), and Acland. 
These represent libraries of say 50,000, 15,000, and. 2,000 vols. They 
all give hints of prices. The standard lists for a small library at the 
present day is of course the catalog of the A. L. A. library. 
On the whole, decidedly the best recent apparatus regarding refer- 
ence books is found in the latest edition of Chambers’s Encyclopedia 
under “Encyclopedias” where there is a list given of the best ones 
general and special, and where under the various articles there are 
bibliographic references. 
It may be said in general that as the first and most general “ refer- 
ence book” to be chosen for a library is a cyclopedia, so in all the sue-

ceeding generations of such works, that one will always be “best” for 
library purposes which fulfills the two functions of a reference book 
furnishing both a condensed summary of every subject, and references 
to the best extended treatises on each. 
ASSISTANCE TO READERS. 
By W. E. Foster, Providence (R. I.) Public Librarian. 
The experience of libraries generally shows that a comprehensive 
policy of assistance to readers must take into account the following 
conditions: 
1 Discrimination in shaping the collection. 
2 Marshaling the books on the shelves by an effective system of 
classification. 
3 Utilizing the different forms of cataloging helps. 
4 Planning the library building with specific regard to facilitating 
assistance. 
5 Supplementing all the above by personal assistance. 
1 Discrimination in shaping the collection.—Library officers are gen- 
erally agreed that strength does not lie in mere numbers; that itis as 
true of books as of soldiers that, for truly effective work, 1,000 care- 
fully picked are worth 2,000 assembled at random. All but a very few 
(such as the Library of Congress, which receives two copies of every 
book copyrighted) would omit also the distinetly bad and the distinctly 
worthless books. So far as concerns current publications all agree as 
to the desirability of some guide to their selection, which shall be suf- 
ficiently comprehensive, trustworthy, and regular in its appearance, but 
they are not yet so nearly agreed as to its practicability. That partic- 
ular variety, however, advocated by Mr. Les! perhaps comes nearest to 
meeting with general acceptance, and is indeed, already tentatively in 
operation, lists on electricity and other subjects, prepared by compe- 
tent specialists, having been put into print. 
There is also general agreement as to the necessity of discarding, 
from time to time, useless parts of a collection already gathered, but 
decided disagreement as to the extent of it. The extreme position in 
the direction of “winnowing” is represented by Mr. Charles Francis 
Adams. Difficulties in the way of maintaining an arbitrarily “fixed 
number” of volumes are pointed out editorially in the Library Journal 
(18: 108), the objections to making even the smaller libraries less than 
complete in such specialties as local town history or local industries 
are emphasized by Mr. Winsor,’ and the inherent uncertainty attend- 
ing any forecast of the future needs of a constituency are suggested by

Colonel Higginson.1. Mr, Adams has himself done much to facilitate a 
more general agreement with the principle of winnowing which he 
advocates by linking with it fh later discussions? the principle of differ- 
entiation in libraries, with which, indeed, it is inseparably connected? 
The following may perhaps be safely accepted as harmonizing different 
views: Not only must single individuals be taken into account in decid- 
ing on the serviceableness of a given book or line of publication in 
any library, but groups of individuals, such as classes, clubs, societies, 
ete., and, back of that, whole interests in the community, such as the 
schools,‘ the press,’ the departments of the municipal government (as, 
for instance, the city engineer’s office),° and, emphatically, the local 
industries.7. Where a library is the only one existing in the place, its 
constant aim should be “to fit the community like a glove.” If, how- 
ever, there are several, as in most large cities, a common understanding 
as to each other’s specialties or limitations will go far toward assuring 
that in some one? of the libraries, at least, each reader or student will 
find approximately all that he needs on his particular subject. The 
“unit of constituency” is thus not so limited a conception as that of a 
single library, but that of the town or city as a whole. Itis possible, 
moreover, to preserve a general “library equilibrium” by transfers of 
whole classes of publications, e. g., pamphlets or government publica- 
tions, from a library less able or willing to care for them to one which 
is more so.2 Discarding should be employed emphatically in the case of 
publications which are liable to prove misleading or antiquated, and 
particularly in natural and applied science. It is of the first impor- 
tance that an artisanin search of the best work for his purpose in elee- 
tricity, where a treatise goes out of date in ten years, should not find 
his way blocked up with the publications of two decades ago.” Yet

even these antiquated volumes may not be valueless, always and every- 
where, if the cooperative principle be kept in view and the “unit of 
constituency” be expanded beyond the Ifnits of a single municipality. 
There is, for example, one library! in the country engaged in scientif- 
ically collecting antiquated text-books as part of the equipment needed. 
for a serious study of pedagogy. ‘Library equilibrium” is subserved, 
not merely by permanent “ transfers,” but by temporary loans, whether 
from larger libraries to those of medium size, or from those in turn to 
the smaller ones, particularly for the accommodation of individual 
scholars, where the principle of ‘the library’s comity toward litera- 
ture” requires it. There may even be, as proposed in connection with 
some of the State library commissions,’ a system of transfers from a 
central bureau to a number of libraries in succession. The ideal condi- 
tion, in regard to adequately meeting the needs of a reader—whether 
the reader. be an accomplished scholar of many years’ standing, or a 
beginner in the use of books—will be attained when a system as elastic 
as the waves of the ocean, which respond absolutely to all the varia- 
tions and unevennesses of the bed of the sea, shall supply, in every 
part of the country, just what is needed and just when it is wanted. 
2 Marshaling the books on the shelves by an effective system of classi- 
fication.—Libraries substantially agree as to the necessity for some 
system of classification, for no one who has searched for a given pub- 
lication in a secondhand book dealer’s unarranged mass of books and 
papers, and has afterwards used a library where an obvious and natu- 
ral order is the means of leading easily to the book wanted, needs to be 
convinced of the utility of this feature of assistance to readers. As to 
specific systems of classification, there is the widest disagreement;* 
yet even here few will question that it is of less consequence which 
one, than that some one of the different systems be faithfully followed; 
since it is but a means to an end, and not an end in itself. The sharp- 
est line of cleavage is perhaps along the question of “close or coarse 
classification.”* The experience of an increasing number of small 
libraries, however, shows that, even for their purposes, a somewhat 
closely divided system offers many advantages, provided they are left 
free to adapt it to their conditions. 
3 Utilizing the different forms of cataloging helps.—Whether or not the 
reader has direct access to the shelves, it is easy to see of how real

assistance to him is the ability to say: “On this shelf you will find, 
approximately, all that the library contains on electricity,” or even 
on the division “electric tran#portation,” or even on the subdivision 
“trolley electric roads.” Yet it is essential that the inherent limita- 
tions of that form of assistance should be clearly appreciated. Of 
only a part of the books or subjects represented in a library is the 
principle of “one subject to a book”! true. The fact that, for instance, 
volumes of collected essays defy this assignment is one of the reasons 
why the larger libraries many years ago resorted to analytic catalog- 
ing, for it is possible, fortunately, to say of a catalog what can not 
be said of a shelf: “On this page, or in this drawer, you will find all 
that the library contains on your subject;” and it explains, also, the 
wide serviceableness which printed catalogs, like that of the Boston 
Atheneum, have had in other libraries than those for which they were 
made. The agreement among libraries as to the necessity of coopera- 
tion to render such facilities universal could not have received more 
emphatic testimony than in the successful achievement of Poole’s Index 
and the “A. L. A.” index to general literature, the one transforming 
files of periodical literature from dead lumber to the livest of circulat- 
ing material, and the other performing the same service for volumes 
of essays, etc. Disagreement in regard to the lengths to which this 
principle of cooperative cataloging may be carried is not at all over the 
question whether it is desirable, but whether it is practicable; but the 
successful execution of the catalog of the “A. L. A. library,” at the 
World’s Columbian Exposition, has placed this matter in a clearer 
light. 
The future of the “subject catalog” of an individual library is at 
present attended with some uncertainty. There can be little question 
that when it shall be no longer necessary for each separate library, with 
its limited funds, to do in a thousand cities and towns what can be done 
at a central point, once for all,? the better endowed libraries will find 
themselves at liberty to spend their funds in making their development 
more symmetrical and possibly in supplying elaborate subject catalogs 
of the “special collections.” The relative superiority of the bibliogra- 
phy and the subject catalog has been earnestly discussed ;* but serious 
students can not afford to dispense with either of them.‘ -An increas- 
ing number of libraries during the past fifteen years have made wide 
use of “reference lists,” and perhaps no other form of library help sur- 
passes this in flexibility. ‘The bibliography aims at completeness for 
the sake of completeness,” while “the reference list is as complete as it 
serves its purpose to be.”® The purpose of the latter is particular in

the extreme—namely to extend specific assistance on a subject of inter- 
est at a specific time, and, in many cases, to a specific student. It is 
thus free from the trammels of the biBliog: raphy, which would compel 
it to include editions or treatises of a recognized antiquated or mislead- 
ing nature; and also from those of the subject catalog, which would 
compel it to omit the one best book on the subject if the library should 
not happen to ownit. In the latter case, the student can go, with the 
reference list in his hands, to some other library which has the book; 
or the library itself may promptly order the book. An advantage of 
the card-catalog principle, as compared with the printed or stereotyped 
catalog, which has repeatedly been emphasized, is that while the latter 
erystallizes a condition of things which once existed but exists no 
longer, the former responds unerringly to what exists at the time; and 
this advantage is eminently true of the reference list. Timeliness! in 
meeting a want at the time when it arises,’ lies at the foundation of this 
method of assistance. There is here also a deeper significance as 
regards what may be called the adequate cataloging of the library. In 
more than one sense no library can be cataloged “ once for all,” but if, 
as oceasion arises, and from the hundreds of different points of view 
which are continually presenting themselves, its resources in these par- 
ticular directions be enumerated, and if, moreover, these successive and 
minute reference lists be filed and indexed, something will have been 
done,’ analogous to the “placer” work to which the miner resorts, to 
exhaust, if possible, all the ways in which the particle of gold might 
succeed in escaping his search. In this respect a wider employment of 
the reference list principle on the part of the smaHer libraries might 
do much to illustrate Mr. Adams’s suggestion‘ that a collection of a lim- 
ited number of books, kept down by a weeding process, and repeatedly 
and minutely recataloged, is worth more to its readers than one of twice 
the number of volumes with no sifting processes, and with infrequent 
cataloging or none at all. The reference list, however, exists in many 
different forms. In its daily or occasional form, it is usually prepared 
in manuscript, or by some copying process; and, if the latter, can reach 
a wide circle of users. In its weekly form it is frequently met with— 
in addition to the instances just named—in the columns of some news- 
paper, and thus reaches the eyes of thousands of readers. In its 
monthly or quarterly form it is found either as a separately printed 
sheet or as forming a distinctive feature of the library’s official “ Bul- 
Jetin.” To the manuscript instances above referred to, usually in the 
form of written sheets, may be added the particular variety wherein 
catalog cards are substituted for sheets; and in more than one quarter

the very serviceable suggestion has been made of applying the Rudolph 
Continuous Indexer to the purposes of reference lists, as well as to those 
of the general catalog. * 
There are few principles so deserving of constant remembrance within 
the walls of a library as that emphasized in an address at a recent 
library dedication, namely, that “Books are made to be read.”!_ Acting 
on this principle, it is the practice in many libraries to study all possi- 
ble opportunities of getting the books down from the shelves and into 
the hands: of students and readers. Consequently the answer to a 
reader inquiring “How many books may I have for use in the refer- 
ence room at any one time?” will necessarily be: “As many as you 
need—a hundred if necessary.”? Consequently also a close attention 
to subjects of current interest will reveal the fact that nearly every 
book in a collection of ordinary size will have had its special interest 
for some reader, at some time, in the course of five years. Conse- 
quently also the principle that for every book added to the library there 
exists a reader needing to use the book, if he can only be apprised of 
it, will develop the use of methods* to bring the book and the reader 
into connection. There is no surer way of cutting down to a minimum 
percentage the “‘books never called for,”4 than by the methods above 
mentioned. ° 
Divergence of opinion exists in reference to the not easily settled ques- 
tion as to the balance of advantage between the published catalog of 
a single library, with its series of printed supplements on the one hand 
and the card catalog on the other. The printed catalog has the advan- 
tages of legibility and convenience of handling, and the disadvantage 
of an ever-increasing multiplicity of alphabets unless the expensive 
“consolidated catalog” shall be resorted to. The card catalog, in 
its usual form, has the disadvantage of inconvenience® of handling, 
and the great advantage in the case of a dictionary catalog of a single 
alphabet.7 
In a large percentage of libraries the “ shelf list” and the “class list” 
are identical, thus supplying a manuscript subject catalog which, if 
allowed to be consulted by the public as well as the staff, and supple-

materialin active use. The tendency to “turn the general reader, in many instances,

mented with a comprehensive subject index, comprises one more link 
in the chain of assistance to readers. This ‘class list” being a precise 
reproduction of the order in which the books stand on the shelves, it is 
subject to the same advantages and disadvantages which have already 
been shown to attach to shelf arrangement, as a help to readers; with 
this difference, however, that the class list shows the titles of books 
which are out, as well as those which are in. Here also, as in the case 
of the shelves, it does not follow, from the limitations pointed out above, 
that as little classification as possible is going to help us. If you are 
on a train running from New York to Chicago, and you wish to com- 
municate for a moment with your friend, and find that he is not in the 
same car with you, it is something to be thankful for, is it not, if he is 
in another car of the same train—and that a vestibule train—rather 
than on another train on a different railroad? 
4 Planning the library building with specifie regard to facilitating 
assistance.—The library architecture of the past ten years is perhaps in 
no one particular better worth studying than in the effective adapta- 
tion of well-chosen means to specific ends. Doubtless some of the most 
effective library work may have been performed in buildings illustrat- 
ing every conceivable fault of library arrangement; and yet, if the 
opportunities for usefulness which have been lost, even under this intel- 
ligent effort, be enumerated, they would show how enormously the maxi- 
mum of usefulness even of such a library could have been increased. 
A few principles which experience has shown to be fundamental and 
about which there is general agreement may be named. (1) Determin- 
ing the position of the natural centers or axes, in the relation of the 
different parts to each other, and thence radiating in such a way as to 
secure the least expenditure of time, space, and effort, as well as the 
nearest approach to straight lines of access. (2) Foresight.in making 
such a disposition of the parts at the outset as will not be negatived, 
but rather emphasized, in all subsequent extensions which may be made 
necessary. (8) Combining, so far as possible, compactness in the stor- 
age of books, with the most generous provision for the specific needs of 
individual students and readers.' In all these details, and particularly 
the provision for the “least expenditure” of time, space, and effort, it 
would be easy to misconceive of the matter as one affecting the con- 
venienee and efforts of the library attendant alone. It must not be 
forgotten, however, that, even where the reader or student does not 
personally visit the shelves, he does so, vicariously, in the person of the 
library attendant.? To a fruit merchant in New York a shipment of 
peaches which consumes five days when one day might have served 1s 
of vital consequence to him, even if he does not take the railroad jour- 
ney himself; and it is no less vital to the reader or student that an 
unnecessary amount of space, interposed between the attendant’s start-

ing point and the book required by the reader, shall not multiply to an 
annoying extent the time which the reader must wait before obtaining 
his book. The question of access to the shelves! at all on the part of 
the reader is one which has two sides, even in this matter of time- 
saving. In avery small library it is probably true of the greater num- 
ber of the books charged to readers that they will have been taken 
from the shelves by the readers themselves and brought by them to the 
desk to be charged. Here the balance of advantage would be decidedly 
in favor of access to shelves, on the basis of time saving. These con- 
ditions would be almost wholly reversed in a large library. In its stack, 
if of the conventional type, with its labyrinthine passages, the book 
borrowers would be not only bewildered, but in each other’s way; while 
the impossibility of supervision, resulting in large loss of books and in 
very certain displacement of them, would inevitably waste the reader’s 
time and convenience. The conventional stack construction is not the 
only one ayailable. Few principles in library construction seem likely 
to prove so fruitful as those associated with the name of the late Dr. 
W: F: Poole, namely, the housing of each great class in a separate 
room, with its own attendants, and supplied with all the apparatus of 
a great study room or laboratory. The fact that Dr. Poole’s application 
of his own principles,’ in the Newberry Library at Chicago,’ is on a seale- 
far beyond the means of the average library, does not in any way impair 
the general soundness of these principles, nor the duty of each library 
to avail itself of their benefits, so far as its own conditions will admit. 
This is, in fact, one of those instances where very much more than “half 
a loaf” can be secured. In an increasing number of libraries the fol- 
lowing principles are now recognized: * 
(1) A sharp distinction between the circulating department and the 
reference department, thus admitting of placing the latter (dictionaries, 
cyclopedias, etc.) on open book shelves in the reference room, where 
they are constantly accessible to all readers without the necessity for 
applying to an attendant. 
(2) Providing an open bookcase in the delivery room, for the current 
additions of a specified number of weeks back (eight, ten, or twelve). 
These books may be there handled and examined, and, when desired, 
charged to the reader, for home use. A reader who should have closely 
followed up his opportunities in connection with this open bookease for 
a year in succession, would have practically had “access to the shelves,” 
so far as the additions of that year are concerned.

(38) Selection of one or more of the classes usually stored in the 
stack; to be shelved in a room by themselves; an application of the 
‘Newberry library plan, with its tables, desks, and other facilities, not 
to the whole library, but to a fragment of it. In some libraries the 
bound volumes of periodicals are so treated, in close proximity to the 
reading room for current periodicals; in others the industrial works in 
close relations with the patent room, ete. 
(4) Provision of rooms in portions of the building adjacent to the 
stack to be used as special “study rooms,” “class rooms,” “dictating 
rooms,” ete., in which the needs of special students, or classes, or uni- 
versity extension centers,! or study clubs, or other studious individuals 
or groups may be specifically met. 
(5) The provision of other “study rooms” or “study tables,” within 
the walls of the stack itself, for the use of any serious students who 
may with confidence be trusted there. 
(6) The system of “permits to enter the stack,” for an even wider 
section of the public, which has been developed under very interesting 
conditions at Cleveland? and Minneapolis.’ In some communities the 
local conditions will admit of going further than in others in the direc- 
tion indicated, but there are few which can not avail themselves to some 
-extent of the manifest advantage thus rendered possible. Indeed, the 
planning of library interiors for some time to come is likely to throw 
additional light on the capabilities of library architecture in facilitat- 
ing assistance to readers. 
5 The personal element.—The library may be equipped with a collec- 
tion of books most skillfully chosen and sifted; the books may be 
marshaled on the shelves in an arrangement which most perfectly 
facilitates the path of the student to the desired subject or book; the 
contents of the volumes may be elaborately set forth in every form of 
cataloging helps; and every feature of the building even may be dom- 
inated by attention to specific needs of students and readers; and still, 
possibly there may be a missing factor, the operation of which is neces- 
sary to the maximum of effective assistance. It is true that library 
“machinery” is excellent in its way, and any library which disregards 
the necessity for bestowing much time upon it and effectually avoiding 
every tendency to clogging, or congestion, or irregularity, will do so 
to its cost. But long observation has everywhere confirmed the con- 
viction that a reliance solely on “general methods,” those for the 
public at large, is like using a rake with teeth too far apart, and inevi- 
tably some of the library’s most vital opportunities for usefulness will 
slip past, unrecognized. The personal contact of the library officer 
with the individual reader is still needed after all else has been said

and done. In libraries where the force is inconveniently small, one of 
two results is likely to follow. On the one hand, exclusive dependence 
may be placed on the perfection of the library “machinery,” with the 
result of great smoothness of routine administration, but also with the 
resulting waste of opportunities just referred to, On the other hand, 
while the advantage of the needed contact of reader with library 
attendant is secured, this comes as a sort of “running fire” all along 
the line, and there is consequently the disadvantage of introducing a 
constant element of uncertainty into the accomplishment of the routine 
work! of the respective attendants appealed to. One of the earliest 
libraries to respond to the demands of this problem and to concentrate 
this work upon a single officer, was the Boston public, in which, from 
the first, the volume of assistance to readers has undoubtedly been 
larger than in any other American library. Several other libraries 
have, within more recent years, established an information desk;? and 
in one? of these at least the officer is provided with no other work, but 
finds every moment of time claimed by the applications of individual 
readers and students for specific assistance and direction in the use of 
reference books in pursuing inquiries, ete. 
- There is plainly a growing tendency among libraries to adopt this 
fundamentally effective feature of assistance to readers, but there are 
certain aspects of the matter which should be clearly recognized, else 
disappointment may result. For instance, so strongly does one libra- 
rian fear the tendency of this concentration on one clerk, to produce 
apathy in the matter ot assistance to readers on the part of all the 
others, that he would take the risk of constant interference with the 
time of every clerk. There are several ways of meeting this objection. 
Where the force is large, or of “average size,” it is possible to arrange 
a comprehensive scheme, whereby, at some time during the week or 
month, the service of every other member of the staff is called into 
requisition, as a substitute, either at meal times, half holidays, vaca- 
tions, or other necessary absences of the regular clerk, Extremely 
useful also in the same direction, though for other reasons besides, is 
the practice of holding monthly or fortnightly “staff meetings,” fol- 
lowed with great success in at least one library, in which the study of 
the many-sided subject of assistance to readers, both in the shape of 
specific instances and of comprehensive general principles, is a constant 
feature. While it is not possible, even by this method, for a library to 
bring all the beneficial influences of the “library school” to its own 
doors, in one particular it is invariably effective; namely, in developing 
on the part of all the staff not only a true esprit de corps, but, in partic- 
ular, an eagerness to render the best service of which they are capable,

in this matter of assistance to readers. The fundamental importance 
of this “unperfunctory ” element in the work of the information desk 
is not easily to be overestimated. Indeed, it will be far better not to 
establish this position at all than to be obliged to fill it with one who 
gives it a careless, an unintelligent, above all, a perfunctory attention. 
This is one of those positions where the bright face of the attendant 
meeting the application, timidly perhaps presented by the reader or 
student, puts the latter at once and completely at his ease, and goes far 
to make actual the ideal suggested by Mrs. M. A. Sanders at the Febru- 
ary, 1893, meeting of the Massachusetts Library Club, that the librarian 
should meet the reader in the position of a host or hostess welcoming 
a guest. There is, moreover, another side to this matter even, due to 
the fact not only of the immensely differing needs of individual readers, 
but of their no less widely differing temperaments and capabilities as 
well.! To read that it fell to a certain librarian to hear during one and 
and the same week two such apparently contradictory commendations 
of this feature of his library as the following, may suggest a paradox: 
“J like your information desk; one is put so completely at his ease by 
the attendant’s interest;” and “TI like the service of your information 
desk; it is so impersonal.” Yet it only goes to show the success with 
which the attendant had suited the manner as well as the material of 
the assistance to the varying conditions of the two individuals. 
The successful coordination of apparently divergent conditions is not 
an easy matter here, any more than in architecture; yet it is in triumphs 
such as these that the mastery of the art is shown, in the one case as 
well as in the other. Not only trained intelligence and genuine interest, 
but tact and discrimination, are requisite here; and it should be borne 
in mind by library directors, not only that the establishment of the 
information desk asa distinct position will involve a generous allow- 
ance of additional time and the consequent expense, but also that the 
officer who can successfully meet the requirements of such a position is 
necessarily one whose services should be well remunerated. There is, 
doubtless, a certain quality of intellectual force and helpfulness in the 
books themselves, in the case of a library of average excellence, and 
others besides Sir Walter Scott have profited from the mere opportunity 
of “browsing in libraries;” yet to base on this fact an argument against 
employing well-directed efforts of assistance, when needed, is to repeat 
the fallacy underlying the familiar ‘self-made-man” argument against 
education. The man, in an instance of the kind named, would have 
made, not an inferior, but an even greater achievement, if, to his unde- 
niably exceptional native gifts, he had been able to add that which the 
discipline of education can supply. The books will possess not a less, 
but a far greater degree of efficiency if to their inherent vitality and 
effectiveness there shall be joined the minute and comprehensive study 
of the needs of readers, as related to the books, on the part of a thor-

oughly equipped library officer. That the needs referred to really 
exist, the experience of the larger and smaller libraries alike goes to 
show. ‘The timidity of the average person desiring information, and 
especially the stranger who comes to the library for the first time, is a 
factor in library administration which must be acknowledged and dealt 
with. * * * We have seen person after person enter a library, 
and, after a brief struggle with the card or printed catalog, leave the 
building. * * * Yet, whenever we have spoken to such people, we 
have found they wanted a definite thing.”! 
It is the significance of instances like these that has led one of the 
most progressive of librarians to distrust the desirableness of universal 
access to the shelves, since in this way much the larger part of the class 
of readers referred to would miss the personal guidance and assistance 
which they obviously require. 
In at least two of the libraries where this personal element of assist- 
ance has been most comprehensively developed, this fundamental rule 
is insisted on, that if the library officer to whom a question happens to 
be brought has the slightest reason to suppose that the information 
which he is able to supply is not an adequate and satisfactory answer, 
the question must be referred to some other library officer who is reason- . 
ably sure to be able to do this. In one of these two libraries, printed 
forms” are kept constantly at hand for this purpose. Sometimes it will 
happen that the library itself is found not to be in possession of the 
work or works which alone will answer the inquiry. In this ease either 
an order is at once given for the book, or recourse is had to the scheme of 
library transfers mentioned elsewhere. Even when the reader finds the 
library classified by a comprehensive system, sufficiently closely classi- 
fied to respond to his varying needs, supplied with a subject index, as 
a ready key to the whole, arranged on the shelyes with as close an 
approach to correspondence to abstract classification as is found practi- 
cable, and the shelves accessible to the intelligent reader wherever 
practicable, he must, after all, have these forms of assistance, plus the 
privilege of a special study room where the bringing of books from other 
portions of the library may correct the inadequacy of shelf arrangement 
already referred to; plus the helps furnished by bibliographies in sup- 
plying a bird’s-eye view of the subject not possible in this particular 
library; plus the helps supplied by subject catalogs for subjects on 
which no bibliographies have been printed; plus all reference lists and 
other miscellaneous varieties of help. And even this is not sufficient 
unless we add, also, the librarian himself, that he may correct and sup- 
plement all deficiencies and inadequacies of the various kinds specifi- 
cally mentioned above, by his own trained, interested, and effectual 
service of the reader.®

Expert ANNOTATION OF Book TrrLES—INDEXING LITERATURE 
OTHER THAN Books. 
By GrorcE Is, New York. 
There is much in a welcome. The stranger who enters the Boston 
Public Library is met almost at the threshold by an attendant who 
invites questions and answers them in the most helpful possible way. 
To those unfamiliar with the card catalog he explains it; he can often 
supply aforgotten name ora title; frequently he names a book his ques- 
tioner needs and has never heard about. Such an officer makes people 
feel that the public library is really theirs; that its machinery, formida- 
ble though it seems, is in fact simple; and when, as in Boston, the officer 
charged with reception moves about quite freely, instead of occupying 
a desk clerk fashion, his hospitalities can be multiplied. Next in value 
to his services, to a stranger at least, comes the aid of a card catalog, 
from its inclusiveness vastly to be preferred to any catalog -in book 
form, and, speaking from my own experience, best arranged under a 
single alphabet. The card catalog has now a formidable rival in the 
-Rudolph continuous indexer, which novel device, from its nonliability 
to wear or soiling, removes the excuse oftenest given for withholding the 
card catalog from the reader. Only when the full catalog, whatever its 
form, and the shelves themselves are at the free disposal of the public, 
does the public library fully stand by the promise of its open door. 
But a reader, specially of the serious stamp, needs yet more; it is not 
enough that good books in abundance be offered him, for how shall he 
know which of them can best serve his purpose? Suppose that he is 
to inform himself regarding the principles underlying the transmission 
of electricity from Niagara Falls to the lamps and motors of Buffalo, 
which of the scores of books presented in the department of electricity 
will take him, beginner that he is, and lead him to a full comprehension. 
of the subject? Or, imagine him to be curious respecting the latest 
achievements of the camera—its seizure of stars beyond the telescopie 
range, its interpretation of color in black and white with truth of 
effect, its reproduction of color itself, or its‘supersedure of the graver— 
which of the many works on photography at hand will answer his ques- 
tions in the clearest way? If, in a very different branch of literature, 
he seeks to know something about the government of the nation, a 
topic treated by hundreds of writers, to which of them may he with 
confidence turn? Or, if lie desires to acquaint himself with the funda- 
mentals of political economy, what authorities shall he choose? 
A response to these inquiries is given ina card catalog of four subsec- 
tions of the model library shown by the American Library Association 
as part of the Columbian exhibit of the National Bureau of Educa- 
tion, to go at the close of the exhibition to the Bureau’s headquarters 
at Washington. There following each card title is a note—in the

department of electricity by F. B. Crocker, professor of electrical engi- 
neering at the school of mines, Columbia College, New York; in that of 
photography by the committee om literature of the Camera Club, New 
York; in that of American Government by Dr. J.C. Schwab, instructor 
of political economy, Yale University; and in that of general political 
economy by E. R. A. Seligman, professor of political economy and 
finance in the school of political science, Columbia College. -The notes 
printed on slips are distributed at the exhibit in Chicago and are also 
to be had from the Bureaw of Education, Washington. Itis hoped that 
in connection with the American Library Association a bureau will be 
established for systematically extending this plan of appraisal to the 
whole working literature of education. To be as useful as it can a note 
eard should tell: Whether a book is a mere compilation or a transcript 
of fact and experience by a doer or a worker; the comparative merits 
of various editions where they exist; for what classes of readers a book 
is best suited; its special excellencies or defects, and important errors, 
if any; how it compares with other books in the same field, and if in 
its field—let us say of taxation, or money—there is no book up to date, 
reference may be made to sources of information in periodicals or else- 
where; if a book treats a subject in debate, as homeopathy, protection, 
or socialism, fact and opinion will be carefully distinguished, and views 
of critics of opposed schools may be given; and, finally, the best 
extended reviews willbe mentioned. The annotator should append his 
name and place with date. To this signing I find no objection raised 
by the reviewers whom I have thus far engaged. 
It has been estimated that books of importance in ordinary demand 
do not exceed 10,000. It is suggested that these works, divided into 
departments, be selected and annotated for public libraries. by the men 
and women most fit for the task. Every day these men and women are 
asked for direction in the fields of literature they have made their own. 
Through the public libraries. their judgments can be placed at the sery- 
ice not only of an individual here and there, but at that of every. 
inquirer in America. Guidance here will chiefly come from teachers 
whose life work it is in the study, the class. room, or the laboratory, to 
know the latest books in a specific domain and master the best, whether 
old or new. To these teachers can be joimed scholars and critics of dis- 
tinction specially versed in history, belles-lettres, the literature of art. 
So far as an appeal has been made to teachers and others on behalf of 
this new aid to readers, the most cordial response has been given; 
busy men have turned aside from pressing tasks to write the notes 
offered in the model library. Their generous assistance has arisen in 
seeing that the need for the help contemplated is urgent and growing. 
Alliances between the public¢ school and the public library are becom- 
ing closer. These alliances, together with Chautauqua and similar 
agencies, prove that popular reading can rise to a new interest and 
value when it has consecutiveness and purpose. At the same time new

books abound and superabound. Clearly it is more than ever desir- 
able that trustworthy pilots be organized to spare the people the time 
and effort they now waste in reading books other than the best, to 
warn them as to defective statements and loose arguments, to invite 
them into paths of study which without a guide they would never dare 
to enter. The notes, of course, will often name books not possessed 
by a library, in which case not only will a reader be told about a book 
he needs, but the librarian will receive a hint for buying which will be 
of inestimable value when the system has matured sufficiently to keep 
pace with the latest issues of the press. As public libraries multiply 
and strengthen we may expect the notes to bring to birth a class of valu- 
able books, translations of sterling foreign works and books by Ameri- 
can authors, which to-day could not afford the advertising broadside 
required to hit here and there the scholars who want them. In the 
Atlantic Monthly for June, 1893, Mr. Justin Winsor says that the Société 
Franklin, of Paris, which acts as a central agency for the libraries of 
France, has found that with the sale its circle of libraries assures, a 
trained writer and a responsible publisher can be engaged to supply 
any needed book. 
As to the financial side of the plan for book notes. The cost of 
annotating 10,000 important books, including sending note cards to, 
say, 500 libraries, is estimated at $100,000, and the time necessary for 
the task at one year. To continue the work on new books of the same 
relative importance, as they appear, would probably require $10,000-a 
year. Can this amount be collected from the libraries served? It is 
doubtful. As elsewhere in the field of education, a service worth vastly 
more than its cost can not be paid for by the men and women to whom 
it is rendered. An opportunity thus offers itself for an endowment 
which at no greater outlay than that needed to establish and maintain 
a single good library can double the usefulness of 500. 
It is said, with truth, that in many towns and cities there is but 
slight demand for the guidance proposed in this scheme of book notes; 
but is it disputed that that demand ought to be increased, and how can 
it be increased better than by supply? To take a homely illustration, 
has not the advent of the Italian fruit vender, passive though he is, 
greatly stimulated the consumption of bananas and oranges? Let the 
trustees of literature learn of him, and rest content only when the 
treasures in their keeping are hospitably proffered to the people, the 
invitation made as telling as it can be by having the best critics join in 
it. If the ignorant choose to remain untaught, to miss the light and 
lift that books stand ready to bestow, let them do so only when every 
means of winning their interest has been exhausted. In this matter 
the recent history of our public libraries is full of promise. Every 
increase in their stock and store, every improvement in their arrange- 
ment and accessibility, has roused appreciation in a degree which has 
richly repaid the means and toil expended. Let public libraries not
-P-A-G-E-1007
  
    
THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 9ON 
only contain but indicate the most helpful books and we shall find 
the public library more than ever the people’s university. It con- 
stantly befalls that a great book reaches us too late to bring its best 
message; the regret, “why was-not this book pressed upon our atten- 
tion long ago?” should lead us to do what we can to spare others the 
labor of mining any vein but gold. 
Up to this point we have had in mind only the serious reader; it 
is time that we remembered the reader who simply seeks recreation. 
Scott maintains his primacy as a novelist, yet it is worth while to learn 
in what particulars modern research, historical and antiquarian, must 
affect our estimate of Ivanhoe, the Talisman, and Quentin Durward. 
In the life of Darwin by his son we are told that the naturalist was 
wont to refresh himself with the novels of Mrs. Oliphant, but who 
shall tell us which of her many romances are best worth reading? 
Browning, too, is abundantly represented on library shelves, but which 
of his longer poems best deserve perusal and why? His works come 
to us as 17 lusty tomes, while few students care for a single book of 
selections, even though it be the poet’s own. When the literature of 
instruction has been surveyed by the annotator and its guide posts set 
up, it will be fitting that other literature receive the same attention, of 
necessity with a lighter and less laborious touch. 
On the general lines here suggested a pioneering attack has been 
undertaken by Mrs. Augusta H. Leypoldt, editor Literary News, New 
York, and the present writer. Their project is to compile and edit an 
annotated list of about two thousand books suitable for girls and 
women and their clubs. This list will comprise carefully chosen titles 
in the whole round of instruction and recreation. The works of fiction 
will be selected and annotated by a reviewer for the Nation. Other 
contributors of mark have agreed to cooperate in preparing the list 
which, as far as it goes, will be of service to all public libraries, to 
readers and inquirers everywhere. The list will be published by the 
American Library Association in October, 1895. It is expected soon to 
enlarge its departments of art and music so as to fairly give them com- 
plete scope. 
Let us now return to the reader in science and consider one of his 
* perplexities, born with the present generation. Day by day he finds 
periodicals multiplying to so prodigious an extent that the fuel of 
information threatens to put out the fire; on every hand he sees the 
serial steadily encroaching on the sphere of the book. For this there 
are many reasons, the weekly or monthly can tell a fresher story than 
the book, it can tell a story too short for a book; advertising which 
falls on the book as a crushing tax provides the periodical’s main sup- 
port; through the wider sale of periodicals they give buyers more for 
their money than books possibly can; many a book on technical science 
is but a reprint or a summary of what has appeared in serial form, a 
 
-P-A-G-E-1008
998 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
cireumstance, by the way, of no little advantage to the book. And 
where in the swirl that now encircles the press shall the reader find 
what he seeks? If he is pursuing the causes which have cheapened 
steel, he must consult not only the journals devoted to mining and to 
steel manufacture, he will also have much to learn from the engineering 
and architectural press. And so aggressive is. the enterprise of the 
magazines that the latest word regarding the domination of the air by 
the inventor, may come in the Century, and a review of the cotton-oil 
industry in the Enginecring Magazine. Here it is plain that to be of 
value an index must be very full. 
An attempt to meet the emergencies of the case has been made by 
the Engineering Magazine at Chicago, the Review of Reviews of New 
York, and other publications, each presenting a list of articles in 
selected periodicals; none of these lists is full enough, yet the labor of 
consulting them, particularly as a year approaches its end, is what 
few readers have time for. The linotype, which enables a title to be 
east as a solid line of metal, promises to lend itself to the quarterly and 
annual recapitulations here demanded. The world of science, as never 
before, is to-day roused to the necessity of taking stock of its wealth. 
In the Transactions of the American Society of Mechanical Kngineers, 
vol. 14 (1893), Mr. W. L. Chase presents a plan for extending the Dewey 
classification to engineering literature. The Royal Society of Great 
Britain announces an author index of its monumental list of technical 
papers. Mr. H. Beckhold, of Frankfort-on-the-Main, began the issue, 
beginning with 1894, of a monthly and yearly index to papers in pure 
and applied chemistry; the Physical Society of London in 1895 began 
to publish a monthly pamphlet giving abstracts of all the papers which 
appear in the principal foreign journals of physics. And a concerted 
movement is afoot which aims, by 1900, at organizing on an interna- 
tional basis, a comprehensive index to all scientific literature. This 
done, experiment in every workshop and laboratory of the world can be 
supplemented by full information of every recorded result achieved in 
all other workshops and laboratories. Then the man of research can 
avoid the blunders of his fellows, need not uselessly duplicate their 
labors, and ean seek their cooperation in ambitious tasks beyond his 
individual reach. ‘ 
Were books and periodicals disposed and indicated as they ought to be, 
we should still be far from having exhausted literature. There remains 
a flood of publications, many of which contain valuable data for the 
investigator, fruitful seed thoughts for the student and literary worker. 
I refer to the transactions of learned societies, the proceedings of insti- 
tutes and academies, of such government offices as issue reports, labor 
bureaus, geological surveys, and the like. So oppressive is the multipli- 
cation of these that the president of the British Chemical Society, in 1894, 
urged the consolidation of authoritative scientific organs throughout
-P-A-G-E-1009
      
THE WORLD’S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 999. 
the English-speaking world. This however, would be only in part a 
remedy. Suppose that the rate at which the consumption of liquor 
advances or recedes is to be ascertained, the information is set forth 
authoritatively in reports of the Secretary of the Treasury, where inci- 
dentally we are told how far the use of strong waters has been affected 
by the competition of beer and light wines. One would scarcely look 
in the Proceedings of the American Institute of Mining Engineers for 
light on the labor problem, yet the volume for 1890 contains a masterly 
discussion of it by Hon. Abram S. Hewitt, in the course of his treat- 
ment of “Iron and labor.” Two examples, these, of hundreds which 
might be cited. In such documents as have been named we tap the 
stream of knowledge at its very source, and yet for lack of indexing 
how little is done with a wealth of material it costs so great pains to 
create! Mr. Talcott Williams, of the Philadelphia Press, who has given 
the question a good deal of thought, estimates the expense of index- 
ing this important branch of literature at $50,000. His suggestion is 
that the work be attacked cooperatively, and that publication of the 
manuscript indexes be sought at the hands of the Smithsonian or 
other public-spirited institution. To the Smithsonian a debt beyond 
estimate is already due for its issue of bibliographies, the last and 
greatest of which is Dr, H. Carrington Bolton’s bibliography of chem- 
istry. Mr. Williams believes that a considerable number of learned 
societies could provide the money needed to index their transactions; 
for the rest he proposes an appeal to unpaid volunteers such as those 
who, under the leadership of Dr. W. F. Poole and Mr. W. I. Fletcher, 
have in times past done so much to bring the bread of knowledge 
within reach of the people. ' 
Were all this accomplished, together with the indexing of current 
periodicals and the annotation of books, I know not what the reader 
could wish for in the way of stock-taking in literature; everything of 
importance in print would be placed at his service. If the librarian’s 
finances forbade his having other than a small library, he would never- 
theless be able to tell a reader where to get what he wanted, and per- 
haps through the cooperation of larger libraries be able to procure it for 
him. Speed the day when between the seekers and the light there shall 
be no obstacle of any kind, the day when the generous, the wise, and 
the informed shall give their less favored fellows all the aid they can! 
SCRAPBOOKS.   By W. A. BARDWELL, Librarian of the Brooklyn Library, Brooklyn, N. Y. 
Among the minor departments of library work that have, in some insti- 
tutions, come to be recognized as useful and valuable is “scrapping,” 
or the collecting odds and ends of information not contained in books

or the cyclopedias, but clipped from newspapers or from magazines not 
covered by Poole’s or the cooperative indexes. In this way may be 
| preserved for convenient reference the most recent facts, which other- 
wise would be buried and lost in the mass of back files. 
Thomas S. Townsend’s “ War library of national, State, and biograph- 
ical records,” the largest collection of scrapbooks in existence, is still 
deposited at the Columbia College library, New York. This work is in 
more than 100 volumes, each as large as a man can easily lift. The 
work is well indexed and is an invaluable fund of material relating to 
the civil war. The arrangement is chronologic from December, 1860, 
to the end of General Grant’s second administration. The price at 
which this collection is held is $50,000, though Mr. Townsend would 
have sold it to the United States at a somewhat lower figure. He has 
also suggested a scheme to dispose of it by means of popular subscrip- 
tions, each subscriber having the right to vote where the work shall be 
deposited. 
The Los Angeles public library has recently formed a plan for collect- 
ing information regarding local interests, which is thus described in 
their library bulletin: 
  CLIPPING BUREAU. 
The realization of the utter lack of practical books on the local manufacturing, 
agricultural, and industrial interests and the impossibility to procure such informa- 
tion has resulted in the project of a clipping bureau, and a systematic segregation 
of reliable matter bearing on these subjects is to be begun at once. A practical 
scheme has been worked out to handle and prepare this material. The chamber of 
commerce has agreed to cooperate to the extent of furnishing material on hand, and 
we earnestly invite the further cooperation on the part of fruit growers, bee keepers, 
frnit packing and drying specialists, and others who have from time to time made 
serap collections. We invite them to come to the library to have our system explained 
to them.   LIBRARY SCRAPPING. 
In order to preserve the great amount of floating material on topics of local value 
constantly appearing in newspapers and periodicals, it is proposed to detail special 
attendants to the collection, segregation, and arrangement of this matter. The 
clippings in the first place will be kept in a series of indexed envelopes, and when 
enough material has accumulated on any one subject it will be carefully examined, 
and only that of some real value will be retained. For final preservation the clip- 
pings are to be pasted in scrapbooks designed for this purpose. The binder was 
instructed to furnish a quantity of ordinary manila paper, cut 11 by 17 inches, and 
folded into sections of 10 leaves each, and punched on the fold. These leaves will 
hold the clippings, and the sections may be strung together like the sections of a 
book. No one section is ever to hold clippings on more than one subject; thus there 
may be a series of sections on the orange, and when these are sufficient in number 
they will be bound, forming a complete volume of statistics on orange culture. The 
subjects for clipping purposes will be assigned, and it is anticipated that by this 
expedient many of the drawbacks of the ordinary scrapbook will be done away 
with. Suggestions for modifications will be considered and results noted,

Since the report on scrapbooks in 1889 a considerable number of 
libraries have done some work in clippings. <A cireular recently 
addressed to more than 100 representative libraries throughout the 
country has elicited responses from about half that number of librarians 
who cultivate the general art of scrapping to some extent, while others

  1008 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
In the fall of 1892 the Society ot Old Brooklynites deposited in the 
Brooklyn library a very interesting collection of very elegant pictorial 
scrapbooks, carefully mounted, in six elephant folio volumes. It con- 
sists of several thousand pictures and engravings, including many 
portraits of distinguished personages. The pictures were collected 
and mounted by Dr. Nellie M. Flint, a granddaughter of Capt. David 
Morris, of the prison ship Jersey. 
Our own collection of biographic clippings have proved very valuable 
in supplementing biographic dictionaries. Local clippings on Brooklyn, 
Long Island, and New York contain much not to be found elsewhere; 
and the collection of fugitive poems, quotations, etc., has many things 
not found in books. Our clippings are thrown into square boxes till 
there is time to sort and paste them. Some libraries keep their clip- 
pings arranged permanently in such boxes. Probably the best method 
of preserving for ready reference is to paste the clippings on pieces of 
manila paper, or on sheets folded once, of uniform size. These sheets 
can be laid on each other and kept in boxes, and further additions 
incorporated as received, the contents of each box being indicated on 
its back. 
The advantage of pasting on sheets folded in the middle is that they 
can at any time be readily bound and shelved with books in the class 
to which they belong. This relieves the scrap collection of some of its 
bulk, and, as has been suggested, admits weeding out some sheets 
containing obsolete matter. The sheets in each case or box should be 
numbered from 1 up, with rubber stamp, later additions being marked 
la, 2a, etc., so that the wayfaring man need have no difficulty in keep- 
ing the sheets arranged. Should the wayfaring man, however, as is 
quite likely, mix the contents of a box, an assistant can occasionally 
set things straight. f 
OPINIONS, ETC. 
The following views are expressed by some librarians who have as 
yet no scrap collections: 
Amherst College.—Sorry to say we haye as yet done nothing in this line. I believe 
in it though, heartily. (W.I. Fletcher.) 
Drexel Institute, Philadelphia, Pa.—We do not keep scrapbooks in this library; 
would like to do so if we had time. (Alice B. Kroeger.) 
Harris Institute library, Woonsocket, R. I—It seems to me very useful and very desir- 
able in this library. But with only two persons to do all the work, when there is 
a circulation sometimes of 4,000 a month, it is impossible to find the time. (Anna 
Metcalf.) 
Jackson (Mich.) public library.—We do not keep a scrap collection, though I have 
often felt the desirability of one. (Celia F. Waldo.) 
Osterhout free library, Wilkesbarre, Pa.—Scrapbooks are among the things I long 
to have, but have not. I find the need of them very often, but I have no time even 
to read a big paper, much less cut up and sort out the slips. If I ever do have serap- 
pooks I think I should arrange in classified envelops, dating the slips. Should pre- 
serve slips on all important subjects. Current legislation is constantly inquired for
-P-A-G-E-1019
THE WORLD'S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 1009 
and as we have no newspaper reading room, we are sadly deficient in information, 
When the days are twice as long as now I shall keep ascrap collection. (Hannah P. 
James.) 
Peoria (Ill.) public library.—I should think they would be valuable, and I only await 
information such as you are collecting to make a beginning on some approved plan. 
(E. S. Willcox.) 
* Philadelphia mercantile library.—I can see great advantages in the plan if they are 
kept in such a way as to be quickly and surely available, Our staff is not large 
enough for doing this work. (John Edmands.) 
St. Paul (Minn.) public library.—I believe in it and hope to do considerable as soon 
as time will admit. The attendant in charge of our bureau of information has some 
newspaper clippings, but we have no scrapbook for public use. (Helen J. McCaine.) 
Watkinson library, Hartford, Conn.—This library does not collect scraps, as we are 
very short handed. I thoroughly believe in it and would go into it to-morrow if I 
could. I am inclined to think that the best way of preserving scraps would be in 
envelops, classified and indexed on each; though not handy when full, or when 
there are many scraps on a subject, the great advantage of sifting out those which 
have fully passed their usefulness will overbalance the unhandiness. With the 
various handbooks and yearbooks gathering up constantly the results, there is 
nothing drearier than an old scrapbook—the living fastened to the dead. 
The future city library must certainly scrap, and every village library should clip 
all local matter. Local history is best preserved in books, and I find the Mark Twain 
book very useful, (Frank B. Gay.) 
Opinion is generally favorable regarding the utility of scrap collect- 
ing. Where it is followed judiciously it supplies a fund of information 
not elsewhere available. 
One of the devices for preserving clippings is the “Index scrap file,” 
manufactured by Rev. H: Crocker, Fairfax, Vt. This consists of a 
piece of light manila cardboard, 94 by 10 inches, folded twice, one of 
the folds being clipped into strips half an inch wide, to which the clip- 
pings are to be attached by paste with number of the scrap at margin. 
When these strips are folded in, the other side is folded over on them, 
leaving a space on the back of the file for lettering contents. Thisisa 
rather ingenious contrivance, and would do very well if handled only 
by the librarian; if used by the public the narrow strips, to which the 
clippings are pasted, would be very soon torn off. 
The plan of keeping clippings in envelops, lettered and alphabeted 
by subjects, is a favorite one, and answers very well when there are 
but few'scraps on a subject, but these soon become bulky and crammed 
if there is rapid growth in a subject, as in “Biography.” 
In nearly all cases scrapping is done by some of the regular staff; 
but sometimes assistance is volunteered by people not connected with 
the library but interested in its welfare and who, having time to spare, 
are willing to devote some of it to this work. 
As the time required for scrapbook making is more expensive than 
the material used, it seems that much might be done by volunteer aid. 
In nearly every place where there is a public library there are people 
who could spare time at intervals to do something, under the direction 
of the librarian, towards developing a scrap collection. The work of 
ED 93——64

inspecting papers, marking and clipping, sifting and classifying, pasting 
and indexing could thus be carried on without drawing very much on 
the time of the librarian or his assistants, and the volunteers could 
hardly fail to become more deeply interested in the institution to which 
they were giving their aid. In the Middlesex Mechanies’ Institute at 
Lowell and at the Lynn public library some outside help is utilized. 
At Wellesley, Mass., the work was at one time carried on by the college 
departments. = 
INDEXES AND INDEXING. 
By W. I. FLetcuer, Librarian of Amherst College. 
Three kinds of guides to literature are found necessary in a library— 
catalogs, bibliographies, and indexes. These are not so distinct but 
that they overlap and are largely commingled, but they may be prop- 
erly defined so as to show the due limitations of each. 
A eatalog deals with books as separate entries and gives a list of 
them arranged systematically. usually by authors and titles, sometimes 
by subjects. 
A bibliography, properly speaking, is an account of the literature of 
one definite subject, or in one limited class, the term being most strictly 
appropriate when applied to a list of the works of a certain author, cal- 
culated to exhibit and describe all the editions. The term “national 
bibliography” is loosely applied, sometimes to a catalog of the books 
referring to a certain country, more commonly of late to a catalog of 
all the publications issued in the country. A subject bibliography is 
an exhibit of all publications on a certain subject, so far as it can be 
made, generally including pamphlets and articles in periodicals and 
transactions, its chief value usually lying in the fact that it brings to 
light stores of otherwise hidden material not exhibited in an ordinary 
subject catalog. Sometimes a bibliography includes ms. material— 
as for example the recently issued Bibliography of the Algonquian 
Languages, by J. C. Pilling—which refers to many vocabularies, etc., 
which exist only in the author’s original manuscripts. 
An index is an arrangement (generally alphabetic, but sometimes 
classified) of the analyzed contents of one book, or of the books in a 
certain class, and is intended to show in what books and at what places 
in those books information is to be found on a certain subject. 
As libraries are used more for reference and study, the need of 
indexes to literature is more and more felt and supplied. In many 
library catalogs analytic entries have been so numerously made as to 
constitute them indexes as well as catalogs. This is notably true of 
the well-known Brooklyn Peabody Institute and Cleveland catalogs, 
and of some others. 
The finest example in existence of this combination of catalog and 
index is, however, the index catalog of the library of the Surgeon- 
General’s Office in Washington, of which 13 large volumes have been  
-P-A-G-E-1021
    
THE WORLD'S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 1011 
issued, bringing the alphabet down to “Sut,” and containing refer- 
ences to 71,900 volumes, 127,000 pamphlets, and 424,000 articles in 
journals, ete. 
But as libraries have increasingly done this indexing of books in 
their catalogs it has become apparent that it is work which might bet- 
ter be done through regular printed indexes available to other libraries 
as well as to the one where the indexing is done. ; 
When Dr. Poole, while yet a student in Yale College, prepared for 
use in the library of the literary society of Brothers in Unity, a ms. 
index to periodicals, he soon saw that it would be equally useful else- 
where. This led to its publication and to its becoming the germ of the 
great Poole’s Index of to-day, elsewhere spoken of as one of the most 
indispensable of library helps. The publication of Poole’s Index and 
its supplements represent the transfer of the whole field of periodical 
articles from the cataloging process to that of indexing—i. e., to the 
printed book useful alike in all libraries. 
It has long been evident that another large class of works would be 
better treated in the same way, namely, collections of essays, papers, 
and monographs, and the A. L. A. Index was lately published to meet 
this demand. This index with its supplements and in successive new 
editions will obviate the necessity of analytic cataloging of this kind 
of books in individual libraries. Still another class of literature closely 
allied to that of periodicals requires similar treatment and will doubt- 
less soon receive it—i. e., transactions and memoirs of the learned 
societies. Much of the most valuable discussion of scientific subjects 
is locked up in these volumes, waiting for the key which shall unlock 
them and make them available. Few libraries have undertaken to 
catalog separately the papers in these publications; all have admitted 
that an index is the needed key. 
The Reyal Society of London has issued a catalog of these papers in 
nine large volumes, which isof great service; but the index by subjects, 
when it can be made, will be much more useful. And it seems to need 
only the same energetic cooperation among those interested that was 
applied to the preparation of Poole’s Index to secure the carrying out 
of this greater and more difficult task. Many other departments of 
literature, which are now. quite imperfeetly covered by our library cat- 
alogs, await.indexing. Poole’s Index and the A. L. A. Index are con- 
fined to works in the English language. There is great need of an index 
to the French and German periodicals and books of essays, ete. The 
admirable ‘“‘Contents Index” of the University of California library 
furnishes a hint of what is needed in this direction, and ought to be so 
issued as to be available to every library. 
An index to biographic sketches and especially an index to portraits 
are also much called for. 
It is not the purpose of this paper to tell how indexes should be 
made, This has been well done by several writers, to whom reference 
 
-P-A-G-E-1022
  LOTZ EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
is made at the end of this article. A few general considerations only 
will be touched on here. In the first place it may be said that the 
alphabetic method of arrangement is generally to be preferred to any 
other. Classified lists of titles always present the serious difficulty of 
requiring a knowledge of the system in order to use them with any 
facility, and although the classified arrangement is found advantageous 
for certain purposes, it is probably becoming more thoroughly agreed 
among librarians that no other system is so generally useful as the 
alphabetic. 
Another essential point in indexing is that each entry should be made 
specific. Nothing is more discouraging when attempting to make use 
of an index than to find a large number of references with a single 
heading and without specifications to show how one reference may be 
of more or less value than another for a special purpose. 
References should be clear and as free as possible from mere techni- 
ealities. Titles of books or papers referred to may be contracted, but 
it should be done in such a way as to leave it-entirely plain what ref- 
erence is intended without the use of a table or code of marks and 
symbols. 
The work of indexing requires careful and intelligent attention, espe- 
cially to two things: The real subject of the article or chapter indexed 
and the best heading to be chosen for it in the index. To do indexing 
well one ought to read the matter indexed closely enough to under- 
stand thoroughly its drift, and not be misled by artificial and fanciful 
headings or titles. In one volume of a now defunct American peri- 
odical an article on the East River bridge is called “Up among the 
spiders,” and the only reference to it in the index of the volume is 
under “Spiders, Up among the.” Having looked at this article enough 
to learn what its subject really is there remains the other question, 
What shall this subject be call in the index—Brooklyn bridge; Bridge, 
East River; or East River bridge? That is, of several names properly 
or improperly applicable to the same thing, one must be chosen and 
adhered to, and it should be the one by which the thing is most com- 
monly known; at the same time there must be a consistency in the 
practice of the index in similar or allied cases. The demand thus put 
on the maker of an index to understand the subject-matter indexed and. 
also to have such a general acquaintance with the whole field of knowl- 
edge that he can avoid inconsistencies and absurdities in the choice 
and arrangement of headings, indicates that indexing is no mere hack- 
work, but calls for real scholarship and the exercise of the best gifts 
of reason and intelligence. In fact, it might weil be claimed that a 
majority of all the indexes now made are examples of “how not to do 
it,” when judged by the high standards thus set. On the assumption 
that “anybody can make an index,” cheap and inexperienced help is 
often employed, the result being what might be expected, cheap and 
worthless indexes. In my experience in directing cooperative indexing
-P-A-G-E-1023
  THE WORLD'S LIBRARY CONGRESS. 1013 
it has often been noticed that the indexing work of some quite compe- 
tent and scholarly men is apt to be imperfectly done for want of the 
painstaking attention to detail and the good common sense needed for 
the best results. 
As to the mechanical details of index making, some hints may profit- 
ably be given. If an index is to be kept in manuscript for some time 
and constantly added to, there is no other method so good as the card 
system. Instead of the thick cards used for a permanent card catalog, 
however, thin slips may be employed, effecting a great saving in the 
cost of the cards and in the space required for holding them. The 
great index catalog of the Surgeon-General’s library, already referred 
to, has been so prepared, and it is difficult to see how it could have 
been done othetwise. 
But when a certain amount of indexing is to be done, to be printed 
immediately, the best method seems to be that of writing the titles on 
sheets of foolscap paper, cutting them apart, arranging them alphabet- 
ically, and then mounting them on large sheets as copy for the printer. 
This was done in the case of Poole’s Index, edition of 1882, involving 
the cutting up and sorting out of about 200,000 of these single line 
slips, making 4,500 large sheets for the printer. 
The Rudolph indexer will doubtless be found of great service in some . 
of its various forms, especially in keeping up an index which is con- 
stantly growing. The linotype also promises to be of value in the same 
direction, providing a simple means of printing an index of a certain 
length at one time, and afterwards reprinting it indefinitely with addi- 
tions inserted alphabetically and without the resetting of type. 
When one considers the enormous growth of literature in the last 
half of the nineteenth century, the conviction grows that no literary 
work will be of greater importance in the century just before us than 
indexing. Already one who would read on any subject finds himself 
confronted with a mass of materia] beyond his ability to cope with, and 
is often forced to spend a large share of his reading time in learning 
just where in the mass is to be found the exact thing be wants. With 
every year the difficulty increases, and it would soon be insupport- 
able but for the great number of bibliographies and indexes which are 
now appearing. The American Library Association has done. much 
to promote this work of making existing knowledge available, and may 
yet do much more through an earnest and generous cooperation. It is 
greatly to be regretted that for want of this spirit of cooperation 
excellent indexes and bibliographic works are constantly being issued 
by individual libraries as part of their own system of catalogs or bul- 
letins, and are thus available to other libraries only so far as they 
receive them by gift or exchange. Some means should be found of 
bringing pressure to bear on the libraries which are thus doing good 
work, but limiting the number of those to whom it is available, so that 
they may be induced to put the results of their bibliographic labors in

the hands of our publishing section, contributing also to its support a 
Jess sum than their separate publication is now costing them, and 
so putting these valuable aids within reach of all libraries and all 
individual literary workers.

NOTES ON EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXHIBITION. 
By Hon. Joun Eaton, 
Ex-United States Commissioner of Education. 
A. final survey of education at the Columbian Exhibition should 
include not only an examination of the collections as installed, but all 
that was printed by exhibitors and others leading up to it and follow- 
ing it. This, of course, is impossible. The purposes of a survey may 
be as varied as those of the millions of the visitors. Shall it aim only 
or mainly at noting the principles and methods of teaching, tracing 
them as they appear in different collections? Shall it emphasize the 
growth of systems and institutions, and note especially failures or suc- 
cesses? Shall it dwell specially on the lessons brought out for teachers, 
or those brought out for the public? Shall it consider what the exhibi- 
tions illustrate of school legislation or laws, or what the influence of 
private agencies has been? Shall it gather up the lessons offered in 
the way of illustrating the influence of such exhibitions, or the mistakes 
in preparation or installation with a view to their avoidance in future? 
Only notes can be attempted. Education in the classification was 
included in the Department of Liberal Arts. Its collections were 
located in the main in the gallery of the great building devoted to 
that department. It was in the charge of Selim H. Peabody, LL. D., 
who had won the confidence of educators by his ability, fairness, fidelity, 
and attainments as an educator in various places of trial, but especially 
as president of the University of Illinois. It should be kept in mind 
that he was not carrying out his own plans, but those of the manage- 
ment over him. The failure of the management to appreciate the 
importance of the exhibit of education was early manifest, and its 
unfavorable effect should be kept in mind in forming any opinion of — 
the exhibit. They’ did not understand that im no other way than 
through the schools of the country could the interest in these plans 
become so universal. Their hesitancy in granting adequate space 
promptly had a discouraging effect upon those who would exhibit 
either from our own or other countries. In the comparisons suggested 
by the numerous exhibitions, great as are their possible advantages, 
there is much need of caution. Are all the conditions taken into 
account? No doubt great benefit would arise if teachers in schools 
and professors in colleges studied more each others’ work. Just now

| an eminent gentleman who comes from an English to an American uni- 
versity as professor, gives us an interesting comparison between the 
two classes of students. He concludes that the average American 
undergraduate takes a more comprehensive view of history, has a 
better grasp of its éssential facts, and surpasses his English cousin of 
corresponding grade in power of generalization; but the American 
student is lamentably deficient in his knowledge of details, and also 
writes very poor English. The professor thought the essays written 
by his undergraduate American student were on the whole better 
than similar English essays, although he sharply criticised the spell- 
ing, grammar, and generally careless style of the Americans. When, 
however, he set his American_students an examination of twenty ques- 
tions concerning dates and places, he was overwhelmed by the lack 
of knowledge of facts displayed in the answers. More than half the 
class failed to pass the examination, the average percentage being 
about forty, and, as a rule, the students who wrote the best essays 
handed in the poorest examination papers. Another from a different 
point of view might reach opposite conclusions, so divers are the stand- 
points of observation or the standards of measurement. Indeed, how- 
ever useful these comparisons may be it is easy to press them too far 
whatever the data on which they are predicated, whether on actual class 
work in progress under the eye, or its results as gathered at Chicago. 
The amount of space given to different systems and institutions or 
features of education in these notes in no sense indicates the writer’s 
opinion of any one of these systems, institutions, or topics. The cir- 
cumstances surrounding the work have compelled the doing of it in 
fragments. The extent of any notice depends upon the time at com- 
mand for the examination, or the data at hand, or the opportunity 
possible at the time of writing to dwell upon a given topic. Naturally 
these notes include illustrations of education exhibited which may not 
be included in any system of public instruction. My indebtedness to 
the many who have aided me is heartily acknowledged. I am spe- 
cially indebted to J. H. McGibbons, chief clerk of the Department L, 
Bureau of Awards.!

MAINE. 
One was disappointed in examining the education exhibit of Maine 
who was familiar with the colleges of the State—Bowdoin, Bates, 
Colby, and Orono—and the normal schools at Gorham, Castine, and 
Farmington, and the different academies of excellence; the well-taught 
high schools and the well-known excellencies of the elementary schools 
in various parts of the State, and the ability and attainment of a large

body of its teachers. Some of the old academies, such as Brighton, 
took an interest in the exhibit. From collections from the Farmington 
normal school there could be learned something of the educational 
training furnished those who attend the normal schools of the State. 
The pictures and specimens of students’ work, exhibited by the Col- 
lege of Agriculture, gave evidence of the good opportunities there 
afforded in letters and in manual training and of the extent to which 
they are improved by the youth in attendance. ‘ 
There were articles from the schools of Rockland, Richmond, Lewis- 
ton, Gardiner, and Bangor, giving proof that, the best principles and 
mnethods are employed by teachers and improved by pupils. But the 
uncertainty about space and the lack of means were deeply felt; and 
the exhibit, in spite of its points of excellence, as recognized by the 
board of judges, failed to do justice to the educational opportunities 
in the State, alike in the information furnished visitors and the collec- 
tions presented for their examination. Those who were so fortunate 
as to obtain a Maine souvenir gained much valuable information of its 
summer resorts and of the attractions of the college at Orono, and 
those into whose hands the Maine register fell could post themselves 
in regard to almost any subject of interest in the State. 
That those directing the educational affairs of the State were not 
indifferent to the event which the Chicago Exhibition celebrated, and 
that it was not allowed to pass without a measure of advantage to the 
youth of the State, in addition to what was made manifest at Chicago, 
is further evidenced by the following extract from the report of Hon. 
N. A. Luce, State superintendent of common schools: 
On the observance of Columbian Day [he remarked] perhaps no more notable 
event in the history of our country has occurred than the almost universal celebra- 
tion, by the schools, of the four hundredth anniversary of the discovery of the New 
World. That the millions of children enrolled in our public schools could be 
brought to engage simultaneously in a uniform observance, by patriotic ceremonies, 
of that notable event, was an idea almost sublime in conception. And the event 
was worthy of the conception. The gathering of the children in holiday attire at 
tens of thousands of schoolhouses; the salutes by those children to tens of thou- 
sands of flags floating above those schoolhouses; the vows of devotion reverently 
taken with upraised hands to that starry emblem and all that it symbolizes; the 
inspiration of patriotic song and recital of the nation’s glorious past and present, 
all combined to form a spectacle such as the world has never before witnessed, 
and which can hardly have failed to plant the seeds of a deep and fervent love of 
country in the minds of those who were actors in or observers of that spectacle. 
In these observances the schools of Maine were not far behind those of other States. 
Unfortunately the time fell when only a part of our schools were in session. Few 
of those which were in session, however, failed to give fit observance to the event, 
either independently or in connection with others. Judging from the programmes 
of exercises, prepared by the committee of the national department of superintend- 
ents having the matter in charge, which were distributed to schools calling for them, 
the children in nearly or quite two thousand different schools participated in those 
exercises. Probably more than one hundred thousand of the children of Maine on 
that 21st day of October took the oath of fealty to the national flag and of loyalty 
to country.

NEW HAMPSHIRE. 
There was no one continuously charged with the care of this exhibit. 
Hon. E. M. Shaw, commissioner for the State, said: 
The educational exhibit was not fairly representative of the State, as many cities 
and towns from which much might have been expected failed to participate. Dur- 
ing the months when these exhibits should have been prepared no space in the 
Liberal Arts Building had been assigned to New Hampshire, nor wasit certain that 
any would be. This uncertainty occasioned delay, and finally a lethargy and lack 
of interest which proved to be fatal. 
The scientific department of Dartmouth College, under Professor 
Ruggles, made a fine showing of drawings, and the chemical depart- 
ment, under Professor Bartlett, made a limited, but very valuable, 
exhibit of students’ laboratory work. 
Several of the higher educational institutions were represented by 
photographs, and some cities and towns made partial exhibits of work 
and showed photographs of school buildings. The village schools of 
Littleton were completely and carefully represented by mounted draw- 
ings and a portfolio of primary work, bound volumes of work in language 
and map drawing, a display of pupils’ work in written papers, and an 
excellent and extensive herbarium. The only cities fully represented 
were Nashua, Dover, and Portsmouth. All these presented comprehen- 
sive exhibits of drawings, mounted and bound, and of pupils’ written 
work, and some made exhibits of clay modeling. A distinctive feature 
of the Dover exhibit was a fine set of relief maps made by pupils. 
Portsmouth made a large and creditable exhibit of needlework, and 
Nashua a fine display of work in language and literature, in many 
cases illustrated, and in all tastefully arranged. The Catholic schools 
of the Manchester diocese also made a magnificent exhibit. 
The exhibit from the State normal and training school was large and 
comprehensive. On wing frames and on the walls was displayed the 
work of pupils of the training school, in drawing, color, ete., from the 
kindergarten through the high school, and from all classes in the normal 
school. The normal school comprised the range of work in drawing 
which its pupils are trained to teach through: the various grades of the 
training school, and a complete course of charcoal work from models. 
There were several frames of photograph of exterior and interior views 
of the school buildings, and of pupils’ work in clay modeling. ‘The 
written work of pupils was bound in volumes, showing the course and 
methods of instruction in the various branches of study throughout 
the training and normal school courses, and also illustrating by papers 
and by plans of lessons the methods of professional instruction and 
training in teaching adopted in the normal s¢hool. The training-school 
referred to asa part of the normal school system consists of the schools 
of the village of Plymouth, where the normal school is located, from 
the kindergarten to theehigh school. These schools are under the 
direct management of the institution. This peculiar and exceedingly

valuable feature of the New Hampshire system enables the pupils of 
the normal school to become proficient in teaching by daily practical | 
experience in what is called the training school, under the direct 
eye of the principal. The principles of teaching taught in the normal 
school are here practically illustrated and enforced. This normal 
school has made excellent progress under its able principal, Prof. ©. C. 
Rounds, Ph. D., who is especially accomplished both in the theory and 
practice of teaching. The award prepared by the individual judge, 
Hon. Josiah H. Shinn, State superintendent of instruction for Arkan- 
sas, and approved by the board of judges is very discriminating and 
just. 
AWARD. 
Development of teachers by practice with pupils, guided by competent instruction 
regularly given. 
Persistent efforts to put the spirit of true science teaching into the schools of the 
country, through pupils trained to this end. 
The union of kindergarten with primary work; model language forms and moral 
teaching. 
General excellence in original plan of practice school, conscientious devotion to 
truth, and diligent effort at proper teaching in color, form, shading, construction, 
decoration, design, and models; marked efficiency of the teacher-pupils who adhere 
to its work. 
One studying this exhibit, and familiar with education in the State, 
could not fail to render a hearty tribute of praise to the great ability 
and services of Hon. James Willis Patterson, LL. D., so long State 
superintendent of public instruction. Other States attempting similar 
steps of progress failed and New Hampshire went steadily forward. 
This was especially due to his efforts and the confidence the people had 
in his leadership. 
A word should be added both in regard to the State normal school 
and Dartmouth College. The normal school was authorized by act of 
the legislature passed in 1870. For this Dr. Hiram Orcutt deserves 
much credit as a member of the legislature. It was located at Ply- 
mouth, and began its first term March 15, 1871. The legislatures of 
1887 and 1889 made liberal appropriations for new buildings, and in the 
year 1891 a schoolhouse and boarding hall were erected. The school 
first occupied these in September, 1892. In the twenty-four years of 
its existence the total number of different pupils has been 1,870, and 
477 have graduated from its courses of study. 
Plymouth is near the center of New Hampshire, in the beautiful val- 
ley of the Pemigewasset, 25 miles south of the Profile and Franconia 
Notch. It is on the Concord and Montreal Railroad, at its junction 
with the Pemigewasset Valley Railroad, 51 miles north of Concord and 
126 miles from Boston. 
Dartmouth College, located on the Connecticut River, in Hanover, 
N. H., and reached via Norwich, a station on the Vermont Central 
Railroad, is the outgrowth of a school which Eleazar Wheelock opened   
 
-P-A-G-E-1030
1020 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
in his home at Lebanon, Conn., December 18, 1754, for the Christian 
education of Indian boys. The school, however, was known as Mooyr’s 
Indian Charity School, so named from Joshua Moor, who in the follow- 
ing year contributed a house and 2 acres of land. In 1764 30 scholars 
were in attendance, of whom about one-half were English students pre- 
paring to serve as missionaries to the Indians. 
Funds for the maintenance of the school were received from various 
sources—from private individuals, fiom the general courts of Massa- 
chusetts Bay and of New Hampshire, but chiefly from Great Britain, 
where the enterprise had awakened the greatest interest. Through 
the agency largely of Samson Occom, the Indian preacher who made 
the tour of England and Scotland in 1765, the sum of £10,000 was 
raised, and committed to the charge of a board of trustees, with the 
Earl of Dartmouth at its head. As the result of this endowment it was 
determined by Dr. Wheelock to enlarge the purpose of the school, 
especially to reach ‘‘a greater proportion of English youth,” and to 
change its location. Various proposals for a site were made, but after 
eareful investigation the site chosen was the township of Hanover, in 
the region of Cowas or Codés, in the province of New Hampshire. 
Apart from the nearness of this site to the Canadian Indians, the 
determining reason for the choice seems to have been the attractive- 
ness of the location, and the fact that it was the natural center of 
“more than two hundred towns chartered, settled, or about to be 
settled.” Removal to the province of New Hampshire also gave the 
assurance of a charter, which it had thus far been difficult to obtain. 
The charter was given by Governor John Wentworth in the name of 
King George ITI, and bore the date of December 13, 1769. A draft of 
the charter submitted by Wheelock received important modifications 
from the governor. In particular he rejected the suggestion of a coordi- 
nate board of trustees in Great Britain. He gave to the college the name 
of Lord Dartmouth, its most active patron in Great Britain, although 
Wheelock had proposed to the governor to callit by the name of Went- 
worth; and instead of incorporating it as a “school” or “academy” 
he adopted a hint from Wheelock’s postscript and made it a “ college.” 
The first board of trustees consisted of the governor with three of his 
council, the speaker of the New Hampshire house of representatives, 
one member of the Connecticut colonial government, and six Connecti- 
eut clergymen selected by Dr. Wheelock. 
Dr. Wheelock was elected president of the college, with Mr. Bezaleel 
Woodward, a graduate of Yale in 1764, as his associate. The first 
class of four students was graduated in 1771, the commencement being 
attended by the governor of the province of New Hampshire and a 
company of gentlemen from Portsmouth, who made their way in part. 
through almost trackless forests. 
The school which Dr. Wheelock had brought with him from Lebanon, 
Conn., consisting of 18 whites and 6 Indians, was put into the charge

of Mr. David McClure. It was made an independent institution, with 
a separate charter, to be known as Moor’s School. This school was 
maintained as late as 1849. It still retains its charter, has a board of 
trustees, and holds a small endowment. 
Two events in the early history of the college materially affected its 
character and growth. First, the gradual withdrawal of the support 
of its patrons in Great Britain, especially during the Revolutionary 
war; second, the lawsuit between the college and the State of New 
Hampshire for the control of the college, which resulted in a final 
decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in favor of the 
trustees of Dartmouth College. The decision was rendered in Feb- . 
ruary, 1819. Since the reestablishment of the college by this decision, 
its history has followed the general course of educational progress in 
New England. 
Other institutions have from time to time been associated with or 
incorporated into the college. 
The Dartmouth Medical College dates from the establishment in 
1798 of a professorship of medicine in the college, first filled by Dr. 
Nathan Smith, who was instrumental in its establishment. The college 
is under the general control of thetrustees of Dartmouth College, by 
which body degrees are conferred, but the management of its affairs 
is committed to the medical faculty. Associated with the medical col- 
lege is the Mary Hitchcock Hospital established in 1893, the ere 
gift of Hiram Hitchcock, esq., of Hanover. 
The Chandler School of Science and the Arts, established in 1851 by 
a resolution of the trustees, in acceptance of a sum bequeathed to 
them in trust by Abiel Chandler, esq., “for the establishment and sup- = 
port of a permanent department or school of instruction in the college 
in the practical and useful arts of life,” was more formally incorporated 
into the college by the joint action of the trustees of the college and 
the visitors of the Chandler School in 1893, and is now known as the 
Chandler scientific course in the college, leading up to the degree of 
B.S. 
In 1866 the New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic 
Arts was established by an act of the legislature, on the basis of the 
Congressional land grant, authorizing its location in Hanover in con- 
nection with Dartmouth College. Its board of trustees was appointed 
partly by the governor and council and partly by the corporation of 
Dartmouth College. In 1892 this arrangement between the State and 
Dartmouth College was discontinued, and the New Hampshire College 
of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts was removed to Durham. The 
buildings and land which had been occupied by it became the property 
of Dartmouth College through the grant of the State or by purchase. 
The Thayer School of Civil Engineering, established in 1867 by the 
bequest of Gen. Sylvanus Thayer, is essentially a graduate school, cov- 
ering a course of two years, and conferring the degree of civil engineer.   
 
-P-A-G-E-1032
1022 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
The funds of the school are in charge of the trustees of the college. 
but its affairs are managed by a board of overseers, which is a close 
corporation. 
The presidency of the college has been held as follows: Eleazar 
. Wheelock, 1769-1779; John Wheelock, 1779-1815; Francis Brown, 
1815-1820; Daniel Dana, 1820-1821; Bennett Tyler, 1821-1828; Nathan 
Lord, 1828-1863; Asa Dodge Smith, 1863-1877; Samuel Colcord Bart- 
lett, 1877-1892; William Jewett Tucker, 1893 to date. 
MASSACHUSETTS, 
The public school exhibit of the State of Massachusetts was com- 
plete in the sense that it exhibited work of every kind done in the 
public and normal schools of the State from the crude attempts of the 
little children in the kindergartens to the fine art display of the normal 
art school; from the first beginnings of scholastic education in the 
primary grades to the work of the pupils just taking their college exami- 
nations; every phase of school life was shown. The exhibit was incom- 
plete in the sense that it did not represent the work of the entire State. 
Of the 252 cities and towns, only 40 sent work which gives a picture of 
the school system in operation, and many of these exhibits show only 
partially the work thatisdone. This fact is offset, however, by the fact 
that cities and towns of every size, and schools of every grade and 
character are shown, so that while the picture is not complete it is true 
and satisfactory. - 
The collection shown, by the board of education gives a good ideal 
view of the work which this dignified body does, and the character of 
the school system of the State of Massachusetts. The distinctive 
feature of this system is the control of the public schools by the local 
committees so far as the choice of teachers, methods of teaching, and 
courses of study are concerned. Under the law local committees are 
supreme, and from this fact arises the greatest possible diversity in 
subjects and methods of study. The system has its disadvantages, 
which are apparent wherever the system is contrasted with that of 
States having a State course of study with a strong central authority. 
Committees and teachers are continually making experiments along 
lines that have been proved to lead to no good result by many former 
experiments. Pupils moving from one city or town to another are 
placed ata great disadvantage because of the different studies pursued 
in different places. On the other hand, the advantages of this system 
are seen in the wonderful activity of teachers and school officials, in 
the multitude of original investigations which are made in every portion 
of the State, in the emulation which exists between the different com- 
munities, and in the constant effort to secure for the local organization 
all that is best in modern appliances and modern methods. The exhibit 
of the board showed a complete series of its annual reports from 1838 
to 1892. These reports are much’ more than tabulated statements of
-P-A-G-E-1033
  EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1023 
attendance and expenditures in an extensive public school system. 
They form a history of education in this country, so far as progress has 
been made in subjects of study and methods of instruction; the great 
questions of organization and discipline, of the means and ends of 
public school education are here discussed by the foremost thinkers of 
' the day, and are universally acknowledged to be of the greatest value. 
A series of maps gives the location of the training schools and 
elasses maintained by the various cities and towns throughout the 
State to supplement the normal school instruction; the places at which 
teachers’ institutes have been held during three successive years; 
expenses incurred by the various cities and towns in the transporta- 
tion of pupils to and from school; and giving the location of cities and 
towns which have local superintendence. Incidentally the last map 
exhibits the extent to which the system of local superintendence has 
reached, and prophesies that within a few years the entire teaching 
force of the State will be under the direction of skilled local superin- 
tendents; statistics of attendance and expenditure; of the preparation 
of teachers for their work; of teachers of the different sexes; of com- 
parative wages; the attendance in evening schools; the increasing 
expenditure for public schools; the average membership in public 
schools; important dates in the history of the public school system 
and the extent of supervision; text-books and supplies; and convey- 
ing pupils to and from school are shown in a series of charts in a 
graphic and forcible manner. Two large portfolios contain the admin- 
istrative forms used by the school committees and school superin- 
tendents throughout the State, and form a suggestive and helpful 
exhibition of the fertility of the minds. of school authorities, the care 
and time devoted to securing the best possible execution of the laws 
and rules governing the schools of the State. A large map shows, as 
well as a map can show, the location of the common schools. of the 
State. Its one distinctive lesson is that every portion of the State is 
covered with schoolhouses, and that every child who is in its borders 
may receive at least the elements of a good education. Another chart 
shows the location and number of free libraries in the State; its prin- 
cipal lesson lies in the fact that 97 per cent of the population of the 
State have access to a free public library within the limits of their own 
municipality. 
Pamphlets for public distribution give a detailed account of the sys- 
tem and its principal historic features. Among them all public stat- 
utes of the State relating to public instruction, with annotations and 
explanations; an historical sketch of the growth of the Massachusetts 
public school system; a descriptive sketch of its salient features; a 
descriptive sketch of teachers’ training schools and classes; an account 
of the recent movement to promote nature study; an account of the 
movement to provide free transportation for pupils when it is advisable 
to discontinue rural schools; historical account of the instruction in   
 
-P-A-G-E-1034

drawing, and of music; a report of the free library commission of the 
State; copies of the course of study recommended for use in the com- 
mon schools of the State; historical account of the normal schools. 
Closely connected with the exhibit of the board of education is the 
exhibit of the State normal schools. This exhibit shows by a series 
of photographs the means of instruction provided in the five normal 
schools of the State; by specimens of the pupils’ work it shows the 
character of the work secured, and by charts and other methods it 
shows the courses of study pursued and the methods of instruction 
adopted. The normal schools of the State of Massachusetts are organ- 
ized upon the following plan: The work of the school is twofold: 
(1) Purely professional instruction, namely, instruction in educational 
psychology, in the principles of education, in the best methods of 
instruction and their historical development; (2) in the presentation 
and study of various branches of human learning with a view to ascer- 
taining the best methods of teaching these branches—that is, various 
branches of study pursued in the public schools are reviewed and 
studied in the normal schools, but always with the purpose of ascer- 
taining the best method of presenting these studies to pupils, the 
normal pupils thereby acquiring a fresh knowledge of the subjects 
investigated, together with a knowledge of good methods of teaching 
the branches. All but one of these schools provide opportunities for 
pupils to put into practice the principles and methods which they learn 
in their studies, the practice school forming an important and essential 
portion of the normal school. They do not go to the extent of the 
famous Cook County Normal School in making the practice school the 
center of observation and inference for the entire work of the school. 
Of the various cities and towns contributing to the exhibit, Boston is 
by far the most prominent. It shows work of every character done in 
the public schools of the city, over a hundred different subjects in all 
being illustrated, and gives work from every schoolroom and laboratory 
in the city. Immense portfolios, huge volumes, and large walls are 
devoted to this display. Photographs alone occupy twenty-five large 
albums, and give a truthful representation of the means of instruction 
afforded by this city. All the usual subjects of instruction are illus- 
trated fully, and so related to the course of study and accompanied by 
such full explanations of the methods of instruction and the conditions 
under which the work of the pupils was done that one is able to study 
the exhibit with ease and satisfaction. The display in drawing covers 
the entire field, from Mrs. Cutler’s course in primary form and color 
work to the elaborate work of the evening drawing schools. The draw- 
ing display shown is of greatest merit. The model drawings and designs 
_ from the high schools are also remarkably fine. The illustrations in the 
volumes of pupils’ work are full and excellent in books devoted to 
scientific studies, especially in the high school department; but the 
ordinary work for the grammar and primary grades does not contain 
 
-P-A-G-E-1035
  EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. . 1025 
the same kind of illustration that appears in the work of some of the 
schools in other cities of the State. The exhibit in the various depart- 
ments of manual training in Boston is very full, and is excellent in 
every particular. Photographs show clearly the conditions under 
which this work is done, and the illustrative work of pupils shows the 
courses of study and the character of the work secured. In sewfng 
the entire course of study is shown by numerous examples of pupils’ 
work. In large albums and in a number of show dases are completed 
garments. Photographs show the pupils at work, with entire classes 
dressed in clothing which they have made with their own hands. The 
work in sewing is developed in general along sloyd principles—that is, 
every process taught is applied at once in the making of some com- 
pleted article. In woodwork there are three systems now in use in the 
Boston grammar schools—the so-called Eliot school course, as arranged 
- by Mr. Leavitt; the course in sloyd, as arranged by Mr. Larssen, and 
the course arranged by Mr. Eddy. The work in each of these three 
exhibits shows careful thought and experiment on the part of the pro- 
moters, and the fact that the three courses are in use side by side indi- 
cates the determination of the city to solve by long-continued experi- 
ment the problem of the best form of manual training for common 
schools. What the outcome will be is uncertain. I am inelined to the 
opinion that the course of Mr. Larssen, either in its present form or 
in some modified form, is likely to become a standard system for the 
schools of lower grade. Whether the principles of sloyd can be prop- 
erly carried to schools of higher grades is an open question, as is also 
the general question of what models to employ. 
Some of the special exhibits of the city may be briefly mentioned 
as follows: Work in kindergarten is characterized by the delicacy of 
color employed in the materials used by children, and the wonderful 
perfection of the children’s work. Clay modeling is of a high degree 
of excellence. The work in the English language, from the lowest 
primary to the last year in the high school, is of exceptional interest 
and importance because of the success attained in the teaching of 
this important branch. The exhibit shows that Boston’s reputation in 
this direction is well founded, and the prefaces of the teachers explain- 
ing their methods of teaching form a treatise of remarkable value. 
The character of the penmanship in this exhibit is similar to that in 
most cities. The form of the letters used in copies is that known as 
the Spencerian style. There is an absence of shading, and the effect 
in the best specimens is pleasant to the eye, and the work is legible 
when the ink is of good quality. On the other hand, it is evidently 
written with great painstaking and very slowly, and the problem of 
beautiful, legible, rapid handwriting seems not to have been generally 
solved throughout the city. Perhaps most should begin the use of the — 
pen earlier in the course.

The distinguishing characteristic of the Boston drawing is the large 
number of original designs. The division of elementary drawing, which 
has now become common throughout Massachusetts, namely, mechan- 
cal, decorative, and illustrative, seems not to be carried on with unison 
throughout the entire grammar course. One of the results of this expo- 
sitién will be to secure, on the part of the drawing teachers in all parts 
of the country, greater attention to pictorial drawing; but this should 
not be used to the exclusion of design and geometrical drawing; the 
three should go hand in hand. 
A relief map of North America, which had hae made from a news- 
paper soaked in warm water, is ine best relief map in the exhibit. 
The work in relief maps in the public schools should be made in all 
cases as correct as possible in point of elevation and borders. In the 
production of these maps contour maps should be used as far as pos- 
sible, and the methods adopted by professional makers of relief maps 
is probably the best. One large and accurate and beautiful map, of 
which all the pupils in the room have had a hand in the making, will 
prove of much greater value than many batches in putty and pulp 
made by individual pupils, and ending in nothing better. It would 
be well if a good relief map of the State could be placed in every 
schoolroom in each State. Wherever possible, pupils in the room 
should make the map from the contour maps published by the Govern- 
ment. Where this is impracticable, the city or State should furnish a 
good map of this character. From this may be taught, better than 
from any other source, a host of facts pertaining to the drainage of 
the State, the character of its productions, the varieties of its climate, 
and the historical development of its manufactures and commerce. An 
interesting map showing these facts was to be seen in the Heaps 
section. 
The exhibit of the normal school of the city of Boston shows very 
fully the character of the work done in this institution. The school 
has an honorable history, and it has had a great influence in maintain- 
ing and improving the character of instruction in the schools of the 
city. 
From the girls’ high school comes a volume of rare value, a descrip- 
tion of the art collections of this school, and a catalogue of its libraries. 
From the Horace Mann School for the Deaf are papers in geography, 
history, arithmetic, physiology, and English that would do credit to 
pupils whose senses are all in a normal state, with sloyd work of a 
very high degree of excellence. 
The views of the Mechanic Arts High School, just opened in Boston, 
show the accommodations which Boston has prepared for a manual 
training high school. A remarkable fact connected with this high 
school is the number of pupils who have applied for admission at its 
opening session. Nearly as many pupils have applied for admission to 
its lowest class as the entire building is capable of accommodating.  
-P-A-G-E-1037
  EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1027 
‘The result is that the city has at once made preparations for building 
an additional school of the same character. 
A military organization is maintained by its high schools. The boys 
of the various high schools form one regiment, commanded by officers 
selected from their number. Each of the schools is organized as a 
battalion with several companies, varying according to the number of 
students. This military organization has been maintained for a long 
time and is popular with the pupils and with the community. The 
instruction in military science is in the hands of a special director who 
devotes his entire time to the work. 
The five school papers published by five of the high schools form an 
interesting portion of the Boston exhibit. These papers are published 
and edited by the pupils of the various schools and reflect credit upon 
their managers. 
It is specially interesting to note in connection with public instruc- 
tion in Boston: 
(1) That the city holds itself under solemn obligation to provide for 
every boy and girl of school age educational facilities, including every 
known pedagogical aid and convenience. 
(2) It holds the education of every child obligatory. Years ago Hon. 
John D. Philbrick, the eminent’ superintendent of public instruction, 
under whom the schools rose to their great excellence, said that not - 
over one child in a hundred of school age could be found uninstrueted. 
(3) Added to the general excellence of its elementary schools ris 
manual training, beginning with the kindergarten and reaching by 
means of clay modeling, sewing, and woodwork all the pupils of this 
grade. 
(4) Its system of physical culture, carefully supervised by experts, 
extending through all grades and reaching every pupil. 
(5) Its system of evening schools crowned with a high school. 
(6) Its system of day high school instruction, numbering ten schools. 
A very competent judge, after careful study of their work, places them 
in the following order: 
1. Girls’ high. 
2. English high. 
3. Roxbury high. 
4, Boys’ Latin. . Girls’ Latin. 9. Dorchester high, 
. Charlestown high. 10. Brighton high. 
. West Roxbury high. 
. East Boston high. DAM 
And grammar schools: 
1. Everett. 5. Gaston. 9. Warren. 
2. Shurtletf. 6. Mather. 10. Hancock. 
3. Dwight. 7. Prince. 
4, Putnam. 8. Dillaway. 
Here every child in the city, boy or girl, who will, is invited to a 
measurably liberal education, gauged by former standards, or to an 
ample preparation for admission to college. What a power for the 
assurance of the intelligence, good order, and prosperity of the city!
-P-A-G-E-1038

(7) The sacred devotion of public moneys to public school instruction. 
(8) The extent to which the public school administration has been 
kept free from partisanship either in politics or religion. 
Next in importance to the exhibit from Boston stands the exhibit of 
the city of Springfield. This exhibit does not: aim to give a complete 
picture of the school work in the city. It rather aims to show the 
lines of work to which the school authorities have given special atten- 
tion in recent years. In a general way, these subjects are arith- 
metic, drawing, manual training, music, and writing. The work in 
arithmetic is unique in various particulars. Perhaps it may be best 
characterized by saying that in the lower grades it is based upon form 
study and elementary geometry. It is closely coordinated with draw- 
ing and with English. According to this plan, mansuration begins in 
the lowest grades and is continued through the entire course. The area 
of surfaces and the contents of solids are discussed and measured in 
grades several years lower than is the custom in other cities. All the 
work in arithmetic is very fulland carefully illustrated, and no portion 
of the Massachusetts exhibit has been more carefully studied than this. 
It gives evidence of most careful thought and experiment, and some of 
the results exhibited are surprising. 
Drawing is shown by two collections of charts giving an epitome of 
the course, and by large portfolios giving many examples from the 
work of pupils in all grades.. These are systematically arranged and 
afford excellent opportunity to study the course as outlined by the 
director in drawing. A special feature of the work is the excellence 
of the object drawing. Another important feature is its correlation to 
the work in the high school. For example, an important portion of the . 
high school drawing consists in illustration of the work done in biology, 
physics, and chemistry. The drawing of the lower grades looks for- 
ward to this and prepares for it. The high school drawing is shown 
only in application to science work, and these applications have very 
high merit. <A feature of this work which has attracted very marked 
attention is the color work in botany and zoology. This work is done 
in water colors, and is of such excellence that it could well be used as 
charts for instruction in these branches in the lower grades of school. 
Springfield furnishes the only exhibit in music which has any promi- 
nence in the Massachusetts department. This exhibit consists of the 
written exercises of the pupils, from dictation, written examinations in 
music, and music written to express what the pupils have heard sung 
or played. The teacher sings or plays in the presence of the pupils, 
and they write to the music which they hear. This exhibit has received 
a good deal of attention. 
The work in manual training includes work for every grade from the 
kindergarten to the last year of the high school. It consists of work in 
paper, clay, wood, and iron, and the scheme is so arranged as to form a 
connected whole. The paper modeling and clay modeling are closely 
 
-P-A-G-E-1039
  ’ EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1029 
connected with the work in drawing. The work in paper folding and 
other kindergarten exercises is followed by simple wood carving and 
other forms of knife work. This alludes to the two Messrs. Kilbon’s 
well-known course in manual training in wood and iron. This work is 
shown in large frames by carefully numbered models and the proper 
explanatory legends. The Kilbon course, as is well known, is neither 
sloyd nor the usual Russian forms of manual training. It is, however, 
remarkably systematic, and the results secured under his efficient 
instruction are such as to commend his system. 
The work in penmanship in the Springfield public schools is better 
than that of any other exhibit from the State of Massachusetts. This 
is owing in a great degree to the instruction given by the supervisor in 
writing, Miss Hill. The letters are of the usual Spencerian form, and 
shading is taught from the first. Instruction in form is combined with 
a great variety of exercises—movement exercises. These exercises are 
an important part of the work and a very striking feature of the exhibit. 
The results show a style of handwriting which is not different in char- 
acter from that which is taught in business schools, and the excellence 
of which is acknowledged. The selected specimens of high school 
pupils’ work show a degree of facility in pen work which it is difficult to 
excel. The high school exhibit is confined principally to work in 
science. . 
The exhibit from the Springfield training school shows the course of 
study and methods of training employed in this school. Its efficiency 
is due in a great degree to the skill and devotion of its principal, Miss 
Read, and the volume is a satisfactory exhibit of the work done in this 
respect. 
Brookline furnishes a small but accurate picture of the work done 
in the public schools of this remarkable town. The conditions for 
school work are here very favorable. The town is so wealthy that it 
can devote to its public schools a large sum of money without taxing 
itself to the same extent that other communities must do to secure a 
meager sum for schools. As a result, a great amount of money has 
been spent during the last decade in the building and furnishing of 
schoolhouses and in securing the best available superintendent and 
teachers. The first characteristic which strikes one in examining the 
Brookline work is its wonderful extent. A list of subjects taught to 
pupils of the common school age includes all the ordinary school 
branches, and drawing, English literature, zoology, botany, domestic 
economy, sewing, and work in wood and iron, mineralogy, physics, and 
chemistry. The appliances for teaching these subjects are complete in 
every particular. Workshops, kitchens, and sewing rooms are provided 
freely, and no effort is spared to make the work of the school life a com- 
plete epitome of all that a child should learn, as well as a means of 
training mind and body to a high degree of excellence. The work shown 
illustrates all the features of this very comprehensive system. Photo-

graphs give pictures of schoolhouses, schoolrooms, and school appli- 
ances; notable among the last are the art treasures contributed by Mr. 
William H. Lincoln, for many years a most efficient member of the 
school committee. The written work of pupils covers nearly all the 
subjects contained in the course of study. Some of the work which 
has received the most attention is that in domestic economy, in the 
natural sciences, and in sewing. It seems strange at least to read in 
the ordinary school work of grammar school children how to dust a - 
room, how to sweep a floor, and how to wash a sink; but who shall say 
that it is not as important information as how many cities there are 
upon the Erie Canal, or how long the river Lena is? Another remark- 
able book is the one devoted to sewing. Here the pupil writes clearly 
a description of what she proposes to do, illustrates her composition 
with appropriate drawing, and then does the work which she has de- 
scribed. This work is attached to the composition, and so this three- 
fold representation is exhibited as a whole. 
Brookline is one of the few places in Massachusetts which furnishes 
free public kindergartens, and the work of these kindergartens is 
shown in frames upon the wall and in a portfolio. It consists of the 
usual work of kindergartens, papevr-folding, weaving, etc., and a few 
special exercises designed for wall decoration, on special days. There 
are also shown several cases 01 collections of natural objects made by 
the pupils and the teachers, and designed to illustrate the work in 
geography and natural history. These cases have given rise to the 
suggestion that printers’ type cases are well adapted to collections of 
this character. 
Chelsea shows drawing and work in English for primary and grammar 
schools, together with high school work in nearly all branches taught 
in New England high schools. The work in English is distinguished by 
several peculiarities; the most prominent of these is the exhibition of 
the superintendent’s method of teaching reading, known as the thought 
method. It would seem to be impossible to show the results except by 
statements as to the ability with which the pupils begin within a given 
time toreadat sight. By a series of photographs of classes and printed 
explanations beneath them, he shows very satisfactorily the steps in 
his method. Some of the prominent features of this system are (1) 
the thought always precedes the expression; (2) all reading from printed 
text-books is sight reading; (3) in reading the pupil looks at his paper 
and not at his book, and the exercises resemble a conversation lesson 
more than an ordinary reading lesson. This exhibit has attracted a 
good deal of attention from educators in all parts of the country and 
from foreign countries. 
A characteristic of the grammar-school work in English is the large 
amount of memorizing literature gems. It is clear that this exercise 
is a pleasant one for the pupils, and its results must be beneficial to_ 
their vocabulary and forms of expression. The course in drawing is 
 
-P-A-G-E-1041
  EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1031 
shown in full and conforms in general to the outline of the State course. 
The work shown is good. 
A distinguishing feature of the work from the high school is the 
written translations of Greek and Latin read in preparation for college. 
Every pupil, it seems, is required as a part of his work to make com- 
plete written translations of all the Greek and Latin which he reads. 
The wisdom of this course is at least doubtful. 
Holyoke makes no general display of its work, but exhibits some of 
its features in a highly attractive way. The drawing is excellent, par- 
ticularly the model and object drawing and historical object. ornameut 
from pupils of the high school. Its work in penmanship is excellent 
in character and shows the most careful training in this branch of 
study. A volume of manuscript written and illustrated by pupils in 
the public schools is a work of great excellence, and has attracted much 
attention. Holyoke furnishes a good number of relief maps made from 
putty andfrom pulp. These are painted to show elevations, and are sug- 
gestive of possibilities in this sort of work which are not often secured. 
One volume gives the record of the history and the course of study in 
the normal training school of the city. This school is considered by 
many observers to be one of the best of its kind in the State. A series 
of historical charts prepared by pupils of one of the grammar schools to 
illustrate history is unique in character and of value to teachers who 
examine it. 
Malden furnishes two bound volumes of high school work and a case 
of chemical products from the high school laboratory. The volume on 
physics gives the method of instruction pursued in this study, and 
sufficient pupils’ work to indicate its general character. The method 
of instruction is adapted to the conditions under which it is given 
and the results are very satisfactory. Some of the illustrated draw- 
ings are unusually well executed. The work in chemistry likewise has 
great value. Original laboratory note-books in the solution of chemical 
problems and the determination of unknowns in qualitative analysis 
are of excellent character. The organization and plan of work in the 
normal training school of this city is also shown. A pamphlet by the 
superintendent of schools shows the method of promotion employed in 
this city, whereby rapid promotion of bright pupils is easy. This 
method is believed to be unique and very successful in practice. 
Medford shows English, botany, drawing, and modern languages 
from its high school. All the work is good and some of it is excellent. 
An herbarium of native wild flowers, scientifically arranged, forms a 
prominent portion of this exhibit. 
Pittsfield shows drawings of all grades and of excellent character. 
A bound volume of language work in the grammar grades, a case of 
construction in clay and paper, and a very elaborate and artistic her- 
barium of native flowers. The method of mounting and the excellence 
of this work have attracted a good deal of attention. 
 
-P-A-G-E-1042
1032 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Quincy shows her drawing, construction work, and the usual studies 
of primary, grammar, and high school. The work of this city has been 
much sought after by visitors on account of the reputation of so-called 
“Quincy methods.” These methods have, however, been so much mod- 
ified as to differ essentially from the original methods which took this 
title under the direction of Colonel Parker. The methods now used in 
- the city do not in general differ from those used in other cities of Mas- 
sachusetts, wherever under the direction of skillful superintendents, 
The work, however, is excellent in every line and worthy of the study 
which it has received. This is particularly true in the nature study 
which has been exhibited very fully and in some particulars more 
completely than that of any other city. In this city we find nature 
work has been more carefully elaborated and systematized and put 
upon a more scientific basis than in most of the cities and towns of the 
State. The drawing of Quincy is also notable. It forms alarge part of 
the State course as illustrated upon the walls of the Massachusetts 
exhibit, and fills several large portfolios, besides occupying a large por- 
tion of one of the winged frames. The work is carefully graded and 
well executed. 
Salem furnishes thirty volumes of pupils’ exercises, elegantly bound 
in half calf. These volumes are in general of two kinds; one kind con- 
tains annual examinations, the other contains illustrativelessons. The 
work of Salem differs from most of that shown in the Massachusetts 
exhibit, in the fact that it shows the work of entire classes alone, no 
selected work having been sent. This of course detracts from the 
appearance of the volumes, while it adds to their interest. On the 
whole they give an admirable picture of the work being done in a New 
England city which has clung to old methods of instruction for many 
years and which is gradually making progress on modern lines under 
the direction of Prof. William A. Mowry, the energetic and philosophic 
superintendent. A remarkable volume is entitled An Historic Album. 
This album consists of a very large number of photographs of objects of 
interest, both local and historical. Salem abounds in these objects, and 
the pictures have, therefore, great interest and historic value. These 
photographs have been taken and finished by pupils in the Salem high 
school. With each photograph is a descriptive essay, written by some 
pupil in the high school and copied by means of a typewriter. These 
descriptions show patient research and good ability and a good degree 
of power in idiomatic and picturesque English. It has been said that, 
on the whole, no other object in the Massachusetts educational exhibit 
has greater interest or historic value than this remarkable volume. 
Another album gives fine photographic views of the school buildings 
and schools of Salem. The high school also sends a copy of its library 
catalogue, showing that the library of the school is large and has been 
selected with great wisdom and care. Another valuable feature of the 
Salem exhibit is.the framed pictures of rooms decorated under the direc-
-P-A-G-E-1043
  
  EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1033 
tion of Ross Turner, esq., for the purpose of art decoration in the pub- 
lic schools. The influence of Salem in this particular, and of Boston 
that began a similar work about the same time, will be far-reaching in 
this important work. 
Somerville shows work in color, drawing, in nature study, in elemen- 
tary science, in language, in geography, and in sewing. Somerville is 
one of the few places in Massachusetts that support free kindergartens, 
the others being Boston, Cambridge, Lowell, Newton, and Brookline. 
The course in color is very elaborate and systematic, and the drawing 
under the direction of Miss Balch is excellent. The course in sewing 
is carefully graded and arranged, and its method of exhibition could 
hardly be improved. The processes taught and their application in 
completed garments fill about fifteen show cases and form a very 
attractive and instructive exhibit. 
Waltham shows only drawing and manual training. Drawing from 
the evening schools and from the high school is excellent. The manual 
training shows Mr. Schwartz’s completed course, so far as was devel- 
oped at the time of the opening of the Exposition. This course is 
original with Mr. Schwartzin many of its features. He follows sloyd 
principles, but his models are somewhat different from those of other 
teachers of manual training. Moreover, he carries the sloyd principle 
into work for high school pupils, including work in iron. His exhibit 
has received much attention, and has great excellence. 
Westfield shows high school work only. One volume is devoted to 
physics, another to business practice and bookkeeping, another to 
chemistry, botany, physiology, and another to English. All the work 
in these volumes is characterized by excellent penmanship and general 
appearance of neatness, and are very creditable to the school. The 
work in bookkeeping and business practice gives a picture of the com- 
mercial part of the school justly celebrated for its efficiency. The work 
in chemistry and physics is laboratory work of a high order. The work 
in English is carefully arranged and graded. In addition to the bound 
volumes the school has sent several of its exercise books, not prepared 
for the Exposition, but showing very clearly that the work of the bound 
volumes is but a fair sample of the work ordinarily. 
Worcester devotes one bound volume to the work of its primary 
schools, seven volumes to the work of its grammar grades, and three 
to the work of its classical high school. The primary work is taken 
from the third grade only, and shows the results of the ordinary man- 
ner of teaching the ordinary branches of study in this grade. The 
volumes devoted to the grammar schools show the results obtained in 
these schools. The methods of teaching seem to have some degree of 
originality and to be generally good. The course of study has not been 
seriously affected by modern notions and knowledge, and facility in its 
use seems to be a primary purpose of school authorities. In following 
out this object they reach good results. One volume from this city is iss 
 
-P-A-G-E-1044
  10384 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-92. 
unique and valuable. It consists of pupils’ monthly record books. 
These monthly record books are an attempt to adapt the French sys- 
tem to American conditions, and seem to be successful. The record 
books are prepared, however, not for the instructor, as in France, but 
for the parents, and are shown to the parents every month. The sug- 
gestion which Worcester makes in this line is worthy of being taken 
up and used in other places with a view to find the best method of 
using the monthly record book. : 
The high school volumes coutain the usual work of the classical high 
schools, with a record of the work of the school in preparing its pupils 
for college. The record is an honorable one and it seems to have a high 
degree of success. All the work shown is good and some is very strik- 
ing and suggestive. The drawing from Worcester primary and gram- 
mar schools is limited in amount and consists mostly of bound drawing 
books selected from the various schools in the city. This method of 
exhibiting has the advantage of showing actual results secured in the 
regular work. Drawings from the high school are excellent and indi- 
cate a high quality of teaching. The sketches in water color have been 
particularly admired. An album of photographs shows the school 
buildings of the city and the classes at work. A series of relief maps 
illustrates the careful work done in geography. Framed photographs 
of school buildings and classes taken by pupils in the public schools 
show the extent of amateur photography among school children. The 
evening drawing schools, long known as an initiative effort in this 
direction, make a display of mechanical, decorative, and pictorial draw- 
ing which does great credit to pupils and instructor. With this work 
is a series of plaster casts from the hands of pupils in this school. 
These are well executed. 
Since the exhibition, the Hon. J. W. Dickinson has resigned and 
closed his seventeen years’ service as the executive officer of the State 
board of education. In parting with the schools and his associates in 
their administration, it can be no small source of satisfaction to him 
that this exhibition could set forth the public school work of the State 
in a condition so far advanced in comparison with any other civilized 
Commonwealth represented at Chicago. The effective influence of the 
exhibit was in no small measure due to the constant presence and 
unfailing courtesy of Professor Gay and his assistant. Professor Gay 
not only entered fully into the spirit of the educational progress of the 
State, but was able to give much educational history which threw light 
upon present conditions. 
MARVARD UNIVERSITY. 
The exhibit of Harvard University was a delight to studious visitors. 
What an unfolding to the eye of the results of the subtle forces and 
processes of education! What a history! What a revelation of the 
sources of history! Educators owe a debt of gratitude to President

Charles W. Eliot for the conception of the exhibit, and the unfolding 
of that conception in the material collected and itsarrangement. There 
was no lack of explanatory prints freely supplied, and the courteous 
explanations of Professor Cummings and his wife, and others in charge, 
left nothing to be desired by American or foreign observers. But this 
the oldest and most largely attended of our institutions of superior 
instruction, by thus leading in the exhibit of education, only performed 
the part which would naturally be assigned to it, and reasonably ex- 
pected of it. The method and matter of the exhibit deserve the great 
commendations bestowed. Besides giving awards to the several depart- 
ments of the university the board of judges enumerated the points of 
excellence as follows: 
(1) For its extent, variety, and effectiveness in the scientific presentation of edu- 
cational methods, resources, and equipment, and for generous cooperation in the 
effort of the Columbian Exposition to stimulate interest in education, and inter- 
change of experience among teachers, students, and educational institutions. 
(2) For the complete and scientific history of the growth and equipment of Har- 
vard University asan endowed institution, exhibited in a coherent series of statistical 
charts, colored diagrams, and publications, showing the annual increase in teachers, 
students, courses of instruction, income-yielding funds, and expenditures; the growth 
and present resources of general, special, and departmental libraries; the increased 
annual expenditures for scholarships, fellowships, and other aid to students; the 
number of degrees conferred, and the geographical distribution of students. 
(3) For vast resources of Harvard University manifest in endowments, buildings, 
museums, laboratories, observatories, and other property devoted to university pur- 
poses, and for extensive equipment in number of teachers, library resources, appa- 
ratus for instruction, and facilities for special investigation and research, 
(4 For the great number and variety of departments represented in the faculty 
of arts and sciences; for the completeness of their equipment in teachers, libraries, 
museums, and collections; for the great number and variety of courses offered, and 
for the exceptional opportunities offered for selection, study, and research thus open 
to undergraduates and other students. 
(5) For the exceptional facilities in academic training, advanced study, and 
research open to members of the graduate school and candidates for the higher 
degrees. 
(6) For the size, number and importance, present resources, and equipment of the 
professional schools of Harvard University—divinity, law, medicine, dentistry, 
veterinary medicine, and agriculture. 
(7) Examples of work of students, notebooks, drawings, specimens of original 
research, and scientific apparatus constructed by them. 
(8) For valuable investigations in regard to the health and physique of the 
American college youth, and a systematic presentation of facilities for applying to 
the supervision of physical training and athletic exercise the scientific methods 
with which other educational problems are approached. 
(9) For the snecessful and praiseworthy efforts to extend the facilities and 
instruction of the university to teachers in colleges and secondary schools and to 
other students, in the summer schools established. 
(10) For the signal increase in annual expenditures for scholarships, fellowships, 
and other methods of extending the privileges of the university to needy and meri- 
torious students. 
(11) For the generous devotion of men and money to the advancement of knowl- 
edge in astronomy, physics, chemistry, medicine, and other departments of science, 
(12) For the persistent and memorable services in raising the standard of educa- 
tion in American universities and schools. 
   
-P-A-G-E-1046
1036 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
(13) For an unbroken series of distinguished contributions to literature and 
science by Harvard’s graduates and teachers for a period of two centuries and a 
half. 
The awards to departments is illustrated by that given to the Har- 
vard museums: 
(1) For the magnitude, variety, and excellence of the collections comprised in the 
museum of comparative zoology, the natural history laboratories of zoology, paleon- 
tology, geology, and the museums of mineralogy and botany, illustrated elaborately 
by architectural plans and elevatious, showing the arrangement and location of 
collections, and by a corresponding series of photographs showing the character of

(2) For the great resources and effective organization of the Peabody Museum of 
American Archeology and Ethnology, illustrated by a typical example of the devices 
employed in representing the exact methods and results of explorations. 
(8) For exceptional facilities for study and research offered by the rich collections 
of the mineralogical museum, represented by a typical group of specimens illus- 
trating the formation and artificial coloring of agates, and by a remarkable and 
unique series of specimens illustrating an investigation in regard to the crystalline 
structure of meteoric iron. 
(4) For the great historical and scientific value and the marked facilities for 
instruction and research represented by the museum of fine arts and the semitic 
museum, and the special collections of the departments and professional schools. 
Harvard College was founded in 1636. What is now known as Har- 
vard University includes the college, the scientific school, the grad- 
uate school, and six professional schools. 
The college, graduate school, and the divinity, law, and scientific 
schools are situated in Cambridge, Mass., a city of over 70,000 inhab- 
itants. The medical school, the dental school, the school of -veterinary 
medicine, and the Bussey institution (a school of agriculture and hor- 
ticulture) are situated in Boston, a city of about 450,000 inhabitants. 
The two cities are connected by steam, electric, and horse railways, and 
are separated by the Charles River. The distance from the college 
buildings to the business center of Boston is 3 miles. 
The university is governed primarily by two boards, the corporation 
and the overseers. The corporation (of which the legal title is the 
President and Fellows of Harvard College) consists of the president, 
treasurer, and five fellows, all of whom hold office for life. In it is 
vested the title to the property of the university, estimated to be worth 
between eleven and twelve million dollars. The overseers number 
thirty-two, including the president and treasurer of the university, 
who are ex officio members. Five of the overseers go out of oftice each 
year, their places being filled on commencement day by an election, in 
which alumni of the college of five years’ standing, masters of arts, 
and holders of honorary degrees from the university are entitled to 
vote if present in person. 
The principal administrative officers of the university are the presi- 
dent, the treasurer, the deans of the various faculties, schools, and 
administrative boards, the bursar, and the secretary. The president 
is the presiding officer of the corporation and of each of the faculties,
-P-A-G-E-1047
  EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION, 1037 
and he exercises a general superintendence over all the manifold con- 
cerns of the institution. The treasurer is the custodian of the prop- 
erty of the university, makes its investments, and keeps its financial], 
accounts. The deans conduct the business of the several faculties or 
administrative boards. The bursar is the treasurer’s agent in dealing 
with students in renting rooms, settling term bills, and similar matters. 
The secretary conducts the correspondence of the university. ~ 
The college, scientific school, and graduate school are under the con- 
trol of the faculty of arts and sciences, from which are appointed three 
executive committees, called administrative boards, each of which has 
its dean, and by which the college, the scientific school, and the grad- 
uate school are severally governed. 
Each professional school has a separate faculty, composed of ail its 
professors and other teachers holding appointments for more than one 
year. 
The degrees conferred by the various departments are eleven in 
number, as follows: 
By the faculty of arts and sciences: Bachelor of arts, bachelor of 
science, master of arts, doctor of philosophy, and doctor of science. 
By the faculty of the divinity school: Bachelor of divinity. 
By the faculty of the law school: Bachelor of laws. 
By the faculty of the medical school: Doctor of medicine. 
By the faculty of the dental school: Doctor of dental medicine. 
By the faculty of the veterinary school: Doctor of veterinary medi- 
cine. 
By the faculty of the Bussey institution: Bachelor of agricultural 
science. 
The degree of master of arts is given with the professional degree to 
graduates with high credit of the divinity, law, and medical schools 
who are also graduates of Harvard College or whose previous training 
has been recognized by the faculty of arts and sciences as equivalent 
to that of a Harvard bachelor of arts. 
The honorary degrees of master of arts, doctor of divinity, and doctor 
of laws are occasionally conferred upon eminent persons selected by 
the corporation and approved by the overseers. 
The roll of graduates of the Harvard University includes the names 
of nearly 18,000 men, of whom about one-half are supposed to be 
living. : 
The libraries of the.university contain about 400,000 bound volumes 
and an approximately equal number of pamphlets. Students are 
charged no fees for the use of books. Ample endowments make it 
possible for teachers to have books of reference needed for the instruc- 
tion of their classes purchased by the library. 
In addition to the various departments already named, the university 
has several other important branches, such as the astronomical observa- 
tory, the university museum, including the museum of comparative

zoology and its natural history laboratories, the botanical and mineral- 
ogical museums, the Peabody Museum of American Archeology and 
Ethnology, the semitic museum, the anatomical museum, the botanic 
garden, the herbarium, the Arnold arboretum, the chemical laboratory, 
the Jefferson physical laboratory, and the veterinary hospital. The 
Hemenway gymnasium is for the use of the whole university. The 
university chapel, seating 900 persons, is controlled by the preachers 
to the university, who are ordained ministers representing different 
Protestant denominations. The studies in the history of the univer- 
sity, brought out graphically, were extremely instructive. The follow- 
ing collection from these studies it has been found possible to reproduce 
here; each tells its own story. They were preceded by a brief state- 
ment which is also inserted here: 
Harvard University is a chartered and endowed institution fostered by the State. 
The charter, given to the president and fellows in 1650, is still in force unaltered. 
The direct grants of money made by the legislature of Massachusetts to Harvard 
College between 1636 and 1785 amounted to $116,000. In 1814 the legislature granted. 
$10,000 a year for ten years. 
Between 1638 and 1724 the town of Cambridge repeatedly gave land to the college. 
In common with other Massachusetts institutions of education, religion, and 
charity, the university enjoys exemption from taxation on its personal property and 
on real estate occupied for its own purposes. 
Beginning with John Harvard in 1638, private benefactors have given to the 
university in land, buildings, and money at least $11,000,000. 
The principal objects of permanent endowment have been as follows: (1) Instruc- 
tion and research (a. professorships, 6. observatories, laboratories, and workshops) ; 
(2) collections (libraries, museums, gardens, and arboretum); (3) aid for students 
(scholarships, fellowships, and other aids); (4) prizes (for essays, versions, and 
speaking); (5) publications (annals, journals, memoirs, monographs, and bulletins) ; 
(6) administration (salaries in administrative offices, libraries, and collections). 
John Harvard was a master of arts of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, England, 
founded by Sir Walter Mildmay. 
“Coming to Court after he had founded his College, the Queen told him, Sir Walter, 
T hear you have erected a Puritan Foundation. No, Madam, saith he, farre be it from 
me to countenance any thing contrary to your established Lawes, but I have set an 
Acorn, which when it becomes an Oake, God alone knows what will be the fruit 
thereof.” (Thomas Fuller’s History of the University of Cambridge, 1655.)

  CHART SHOWING GROWTH OF THE LIBRARY OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY, 
1830—1893. 
Harvard College Library began in 1638 with John Harvard's bequest of 
260 volumes. In 1764 the library had increased to more than 5,000 vol- umes, when it was burned, only two or three hundred books being saved. 
A chief benefactor in restoring it was Thomas Hollis, of Ehgland, who 
pare many volumes, and, in 1774, left a fund of £500, which is the dldest 
ic fund of the Hbrary at present. In 1800 Samuel Shapleigh, its li- brarian, died and left the second fund. These two funds, amounting 
together to $6,000, remained the only source of regular income for the buyi of books till 1842, when a number of Boston merchants contrib- 
ted $42,0C0, which was ‘not, however, funded: but was spent.

THE MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY. 
This has become one of the most important of the institutions which 
assure the progress of intelligence and culture in Boston. It promotes 
the skill of industry in various departments of activity, such as com- 
Merce and manufactures, as well as culture in literature and science. 
When started, it was a great departure from the old order. Hon. John 
D, Philbrick, LL. D., superintendent of the schools of the city, was one 
of the leaders who felt the need of this departure. A group of emi- 
nent men have guided it wisely toward the day of its great triumph. 
’ At the Centennial at Philadelphia, Professor Runkle, after a careful 
study of the Russian manual training exhibit there, adopted for the 
institute in the main the features there illustrated, and since then the 
institute has made important contributions to this department of 
instruction. Fortunately the doors of the institute are open to women. 
Here Mrs. Richards led the way in women’s work in the chemical lab- 
oratory, and has done great credit to all concerned. The space occu- 
pied by the institute exhibit was packed with facts and thought. The 
board of judges expressed its points of excellence appropriately in 
their award, as follows: 
For excellence (i) as a general school of technology, covering nearly the whole 
ground of science as applied to the useful arts, being the largest institution of its 
kind in the United States; (2) of extensive and varied equipment and admirable 
appliances and methods of instruction; (3) of courses of study arranged to supple- 
ment and reinforce one another, requiring thorough general scientific and literary 
preparation for specialized work; (4) of high character of students’ work as shown 
by drawings, plats and sketches, shopwork in wood and metals, and particularly by 
theses of graduated students; (5) in the cultivation of correct taste as shown in stu- 
dents’ work in general, but especially in the fine execution and lettering of draw- 
ings, and in the tinting and shading of architectural work; (6) of original researches 
carried on in chemistry, biology, electricity—and other specialties, for example, the 
examination of the potable waters of Massachusetts, both chemical and biological, 
earried on for the past five years in the laboratories of the institute; (7) for designs 
for textile fabrics by the students of the Lowell free school, a branch of the insti- 
tute, showing intelligent appreciation of the need of adapting designs to the pro- 
cesses and machines of manufacture; (8) lecture notes, covering several thousand 
pages, prepared by members of the faculty and printed for the use of students; (9) 
of high degree of specialization—for example, courses by experts in heating and 
ventilation, in heat measurement in the department of physics, and in such practical 
arts as railway signals and electric-light wiring; (10) of arrangements and devices 
for administration as conducted by Gen. Francis A. Walker, president. 
    The exhibit of Amherst college showed the American college idea 
preserved in its integrity but advanced in principles and methods as 
well as in means and appliances to the frontin their adaptation to pres- 
ent educational activity. The exhibit made no attempt to be striking, 
put yielded ample reward to every careful examination. There practice 
follows the theory that the number of students should not so outnum- 
ber the faculty that the influence of the latter may not permeate the 
whole body of the college and their personal contact or intercourse

fail to become a predominating factor in the life of the youth in attend- 
ance. The line of eminent presidents is well sustained by Hon. Merrill 
E. Gates, LL. D. 
Williams College was represented chiefly by photographs, which 
recalled its solid work for Christian learning, and specially that under 
its great president, Mark Hopkins. Fortunately his administrative 
mantle is not unworthily worn by President Franklin Carter, Ph. D., 
LL. D. 
Tufts College, a new foundation, appropriately set forth its increas- 
ing advantages. Its president, E. H. Capen, D.D., is active in bringing 
the college in allits relations to educational progress. It now admits 
women. 
Clark University has a history of only a few years, but has already 
won leadership in special lines. Its exhibit, in addition to photos, con- 
sisted of forty volumes of advanced research. Its president is the 
eminent educator, G. Stanley Hall, Ph. D., LL.D. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE HIGHER EDUCATION OF WOMEN, 
Coedueation of the sexes has not yet been adopted by the older col- 
leges for men in Massachusetts, but the provision for the higher educa- 
tion of women in the State is made in a group of institutions of great 
merit, beginning with Mount Holyoke, where Mary Lyon led the way 
in a great forward step in the education of women,.which now furnishes 
a full college course. Then there is Smith and Wellesley, and the Havr- 
yard Annex—not to mention Abbott, Bradford, and Lasell, and others, 
which furnish most excellent opportunities of their grade for women, 
in addition to the instruction open to them in normal schools and high 
schools in the State. In the alcove where this feature of the exhibit 
was gathered the progressive women from all lands were often found 
taking notes. More literature could have been furnished to advantage. 
The pamphlet entitled Mount Holyoke College fitly says: 
‘Through Mary Lyon, and the school she founded, God led his people. into afaller 
recognition of the truth thatnot for one sex alone was intellectual culture designed ; 
that in His likeness woman as well as man was formed, and the gifts bestowed. on 
her were not to be neglected. First of the chartered institutions to hold permanent 
funds for the education of women, its mission was twofold. First, to educate the 
individual woman to the highest development of her powers; second, to educate the 
public to allow and desire this development. 
Instruction in the Catholic institutions of the State has been respon- 
sive to the general progress of education in buildings, principles, and. 
methods. Itis unfortunate that at any time there has been conflict 
between their friends and .the public schools. The quality of their 
work is recognized by the numerous awards bestowed upon separate 
institutions and schools by the board of judges. 
The work done in Massachusetts for its feeble-minded and blind 
and deaf and dumb, as exhibited, deserves special attention. Indeed, 
a survey of the educational exhibit from this State alone might easily 
fill 2 volume.

INSTITUTIONS SUSTAINED BY AMERICANS FOR THE HIGHER EDUCATION OF GIRLS 
IN OTHER LANDS. 
All peoples and nations have made contributions toward the build- 
ing of the institutions of America. What can be more natural than 
that the American people should endeavor to make some return by pro- 
moting education in other lands? 
The exhibits of two institutions, originating with Americans, were 
installed in an aleove mainly oceupied by Mount Holyoke and other 
institutions for the higher education of women in Massachusetts. 
The International Institute for Girls iv Spain.—This was established 
under the immediate care of Mrs. Alice Gordon Gulick some ten years 
-ago.as a boarding school for the: higher Christian education of girls of 
the middle and lower classes. During this time there have been 113 
boarding pupils, 90 of whom were Spanish, 18 Mnglish, 4 Americans, 
and 1 German. Thirty Spanisl girls have graduated. Recently 
classes for boys have been added, and evening classes for men. he 
system of instruction is graded from the kindergarten to the class 
which is expected to take the degree of bachelor of arts from the 
State institute. ‘Lhe first girls in the history of Spain that have been 
prepared in a woman’s school for the examination of the State insti- 
tute for boys of the province of Guipuzeoa, located at San Sebastian, 
as candidates for the degree of bachelor of arts: were prepared in this 
school. Two of the girls examined in 1890 received the highest marks 
given. The exhibit, including the explanatory literature, gives a favor- 
able idea of the excellent work accomplished. 
The American College for Girls at Constantinople.—This exhibit also 
was of special interest. The aim of this institution is to: meet the 
demand of the Turkish Empire at Constantinople for higher Christian 
education for the daughters-of the people of all classes of the various: 
nationalities, for boarding and day students. The students come from 
Batoum in Russia, from distant cities in the Turkish Empire, and 
from Roumania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, and Greece, besides many from 
Constantinople. American ladies constitute the faculty. The college 
course embraces a period of four years. It is expected that another 
year will be added. Special courses may be pursued. The language 
of the college is English. Each lady of the faculty adopts one of the 
spoken languages of the students, and the president, Miss Patrick, is 
proficient in six languages. Hach student is required to study her 
own vernacular and pass examinations in it. To meet a special want 
a preparatory course, including the kindergarten, has been established. 
The college occupies: two buildings, located on a commanding site in 
Scutari, a suburb of Constantinople on the Asiatic shore, overlooking 
the city, the Bosporus, and. the Sea.of. Marmora. 
The income from the students has already amounted to over $100,000, 
The boarding students number nearly 100. Of the 90 graduates of the

institution 50 are engaged in teaching. In the three years since the 
institution became a college, 19 students have taken the degree of 
bachelor of arts. 
SOCIETY TO ENCOURAGE STUDIES AT HOME. 
A modest but effective exhibit called attention to the efficient work 
of this Boston society. This society stands in well-marked contrast to 
some similar efforts which beguile people into buying diplomas, The 
society was founded in 1873, with the purpose of inducing ladies to 
form the habit of devoting some part of every day to study of a sys- 
tematie and thorough kind. It is found that, even if the time devoted 
daily to this use is short, much can be accomplished by perseverance, 
and the habit soon becomes a delightful one. Its methods have been 
gradually matured during the nineteen years of its existence, and they 
will continue to be improved as experience may recommend them to 
the managers. Nearly two hundred ladies give their services in the 
instruction by correspondence, each one attaching herself to some spe- 
cialty. Each one being furnished with lists of books as well as with 
printed directions, and constantly communicating with the head of her 
department, uniformity is secured, while each student is treated indi- 
vidually with regard to her special needs. Each student being advised 
also to confine herself to one or at most two subjects at a time, learns 
the advantage of thoroughness and the pleasure of accurate knowl- 
edge. Special reliance is placed upon monthly correspondence, the 
habit of making memory notes, and frequent examination on topics or 
books, the student being on honor not to ee her books on answer- 
ing. There are no competitive examinations and no diplomas are given. 
The lending library is found to be of special advantage. 
The report of the twentieth annual meeting, June 1, 1893, at the 
house of the secretary, 41 Marlborough street, Boston, is full of interest. 
Eighty members were present. Such distant points as Syracuse, N. 
and Bangor, Me. were represented. The chairman, Samuel Eliot, 
LL. D., presided. The work of the year was carefully reviewed, and 
reported much encouragement. The term extends from Ole 1 to 
Junel. In twenty years 6,534 names have been entered, some of them 
for fifteen, sixteen, and seventeen terms. The students are mainly 
from Massachusetts and the Middle States, but 28 are from the Pacifie 
Coast States, 2 from Canada, 1 from the Sandwich Islands, and 2 from 
Japan, out of the 423 entered this term, of whom 193 were new stu- 
dents. There were 785 examinations, 3,465 letters written to students, 
and 3,128 received from students; the total expenditure was $827.99. 
Students in science are encouraged to study after Agassiz, from speci- 
mens and not from books.     n 
INSTRUCTIONS IN COOKERY. 
The Rumford Kitchen.—This exhibit was located near the south door 
of the anthropological building. It was described as the outgrowth of 
the work in the application of the principles of chemistry to the science
-P-A-G-E-1071
  
  EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1061 
of cooking, which has for three years been carried on as an educational 
agency by Mrs, Prof. Robert H. Richards, of the Institute of Technology, 
and Mrs. Dr. John J. Abel, with pecuniary assistance from certain 
public-spirited citizens of Boston. 
The Massachusetts board of World’s Fair managers, recognizing the 
high scientific character of those who have initiated and conducted this 
enterprise, and believing that such practical demonstration of the use- 
fulness of domestic science could not fail to be of advantage to multi- 
tudes of visitors to the Columbian Exposition, invited the ladies named 
to open the Rumford Kitchen as a part of the exhibit of Massachusetts 
in connection with the bureau of hygiene and sanitation. In order to 
reduce, in some degree, the expenses of this exhibit, the food cooked in 
the Rumford Kitchen was sold under a concession from the administra- 
tion of the Exposition; but it should be understood that this was not a 
money-making exhibit; that nothing was cooked for the sake of being 
sold, and that the enterprise was to be regarded as absolutely a seien- 
tific and educational one. The exhibit consisted of ten parts: 
(1) A selection from the apparatus used in the New England Kitchen 
in Boston for the preparation of certain kinds of food. 
(2) Samples of the food served at the tables to illustrate the effects 
of cooking by the methods used. 
(3) Samples of food prepared for the very sick. 
(4) Menus giving the composition and food value of the dishes thus 
cooked and served. 
(5) Charts and diagrams illustrating methods of teaching important 
facts in connection with food. 
(6) Models of some of Count Rumford’s inventions. 
(7) Alibrary containing Count Rumford’s complete works, and various 
other publications of interest. 
(8) A series of leaflets written expressly for this exhibit by eminent 
authorities, or selected from the literature of the New England Kitchen. 
(9) A kitchen laboratory table with indispensable apparatus. 
(10) Some forms of apparatus and some utensils especially desirable 
for home use. ‘ 
The purpose of the exhibit was, first, to commemorate the services 
to the cause of domestic science rendered by Count Rumford one hun- 
dred years ago, services which to-day stand unrivaled in spite of the 
progress of other departments during this century; second, to serve as 
an incentive to further work in the same direction, as he expressed it, 
“tg provoke men to investigation,” “to cause doubt, that first step 
toward knowledge.” 
The Rumford Kitchen, then, stands for the application of science to 
the preparation of food. The common practice is now well-nigh as bad 
as when Count Rumford so strongly deprecated it. We can to-day only 
echo his statements, ‘“‘The common kitchen range seems to have been 
calculated for the express purpose of devouring fuel.” “It is a com-

mon habit to boil a dish of tea with fuel sufficient to cook a dinner fon 
fifty men.” “A real improvement in the art of cookery which unites: 
the advantage of economy with wholesomeness. and an increased enjoy- 
ment in eating appears to me very interesting.” The century which has 
passed has indeed added some things to our knowledge of food. The 
increase in facility of transportation and in means of preservation has 
increased many times the number of food materials available. Cheim- 
ical analysis has given us the ultimate composition of most of these 
food materials, and the agricultural experiment stations have, as a 
side issue, determined in a few cases the amount of these food materials 
which are daily required by the human animal, so that we have already 
a basis upon which to build; but there still remains the most important 
branch of the subject, the one to which Count Rumford gave his atten- 
tion, namely, the relation of the proportion of food materials and their 
combination to the best and most economical nutrition of men. In 
fact we must carry on the study of the “science ef nutrition” which 
Count Rumford so well began. Itis, then, not as an exponent of. any 
theory, not as an advecate of any process, not as illustrating a univer- 
sal panacea for all of the ills of mankind, not as-offering a completed 
plan to be exactly followed that the Rumford Kitchen has been fitted 
up, but rather to show that certain knowledge is within our reach and 
that certain improvements are possible in the line of our daily life. It 
is hoped to arouse the intelligent, thinking citizen to the need and to 
the possibility of improvements in these directions. 
RHODE ISLAND. 
Rhode Island exhibited characteristic features of her educational 
work, The State board of education gave an idea of its efficient 
methods. Brown University called attention to its excelient equip- 
ment for the sound college instruction which it has inrparted during 
its long history, showing some specimens from its valuable museum of 
natural history. 
Secondary instruction was represented by that excellent institution 
known as the Friends’ School, so highly reputed for its thoroughness 
in all departments of work, and by a number of the well-equipped and 
well-conducted high schools like those of Providence and Pawtucket. 
It was gratifying to observe that these institutions are conducted with 
careful regard for the grades below and the grades above, and for the 
entrance of pupils upon active life. The question of the support of the 
public high school has been settled by its demonstrated utility. There 
is an increasing demand for its grade of instruction beyond the large ~ 
cities where it was first developed. No adequate opportunity was 
afforded to study the work of the ungraded country schools, in which 
so large a share of the people receive their only instruction. But the 
smallness of the State gives the board of education and the elevating 
influences of the other cooperating agencies, such as the high schools,
-P-A-G-E-1073

normal schools, and the university, the opportunity to reach favorably 
the most obscure districts. The elementary work shown. by cities was 
of excellent quality. It gave good evidence of the advance of the 
qualification of teachers and of the wisdom of the supervision. The 
normal school, once abolished, has, since its restoration, done such good 
work in uplifting the schools of the State by improving the teaching, 
that no one now would think the State could do without it. The influ- 
ence of Wayland, Barnard, Hazard, Bicknell, and their coadjutors, 
upon the education of the State is still manifest. 
The constant effort of Hon. T..B. Stockwell, the present experienced 
and faithful commissioner, made apparent by the exhibition to devise 
and adapt improved methods of teaching common schools, deserves 
special mention. 
The drawing learned by the pupils is brought into immediate use to 
add interest to history, physiology, and geography. In some instanees 
these drawings were of a high order. The progressive map drawing 
and Cictation exercises attracted special attention. The efforts of the 
pupils to make apparatus and collections to aid them in their work, 
especially of antiquities of the place of their residence and of the prod- 
ucts of its industries, were an agreeable surprise to many. 
All grades of work in Newport and Westerly were heartily eom- 
mended. The School of Design (Providence) showed an excellent 
exhibit. 
CONNECTICUT. 
In Connecticut the town preceded the colony or State, and towns 
united to form the colony or State; in other colonies, the colony or 
State authorized the organization of towns. Naturally, therefore, in 
the exhibit from Connecticut we look for emphasis of the work by. 
towns, and some twelve exhibited. These were centers of population or 
larger towns. The object of the exhibit was declared to be: (1) Plans 
of teaching by subjects, showing the end or object in view, on charts 
and by complete outlines in books prepared by teachers; (2) methods, 
apparatus, material, and. devices. showing means used. in teaching; (3) 
books containing the work of the children, showing the best work done 
under the plan and with the means. 
The exhibit was grouped by towns, and. to assist visitors who wished 
to study certain lines of educational work a catalogue of subjects 
was arranged by which the illustrations of reading, language, litera- 
ture, penmanship, science, geography, history of civil government, 
arithmetic, geometry, drawing, manual training, clay modeling, sewing, 
cooking, music, and bookkeeping could be traced through the several 
exhibits. In such exhibits as those from New Britain, New Haven, 
and Bridgeport, the work of pupils could be studied in connection with 
the programme authorized for the schools. The system of publie 
schools is organized according to statute, and their supervision is,

intrusted to a State board of education, whose executive officer is the 
secretary, Hon. Charles D. Hine. Hon. B. G. Northrop was for many 
years known to the country as the active and zealous secretary of this 
board. The expenses of the public schools are met by disbursements 
from the State treasury and by local tax levied by the several towns. 
Connecticut has a historic school fund derived from the sale of western 
reserve lands whose operations and influence from the first is well 
worth careful study. The office of the secretary of the State board 
of education was represented by a very valuable series of State 
reports. There should be complete sets for historical purposes in the 
several towns as well as in the State office. The enforcement of the 
laws against absentees in this State has not only secured good results 
in the attendance and training of the youth, but has received decided 
approval from the people. The industrial school for the reform of 
juvenile offenders showed work indicative of good training in letters, 
industry, and character. The school for the edueation of the deaf and 
dumb at Hartford is the first in the United States founded for this 
unfortunate class. The elder Gallaudet, aman of scholarly attainments 
and of tender sympathies and devoted Christain character, was touched 
by the sight of the misfortune of the deaf-mute Alice, and went to 
Europe and brought to America the methods there already devised for 
the instruction of those deprived of the sense of hearing and the power 
of speech. The difficulties to be overcome were many, but the zeal of 
Dr. Gallaudet was rewarded by triumph over them all. The public, as 
pupils were trained, was called to see the results; exhibitions and 
explanations were made in different parts of the country. The cause 
was seen to be one of public concern, and State after State made pro- 
vision for its deaf and dumb. The aid of Congress was successfully 
invoked and the education of deaf-mutes in America was not left to the 
_ uncertain private action tothe extent that it was in European countries. 
The inclination to call these institutions asylums did not prevent their 
becoming a part of the public provision for the education of youth. 
Cities now have deaf-mute schools of their own. The Horace Mann 
School of Boston is a worthy illustration. 
The provision for the preparation of teachers is shown by the exhibit 
to be made in part by the State and partly by cities. The State now 
provides for two normal schools, one at New Britain and one at Willi- 
mantic. The former, one of the first in the country, has a history 
specially worthy of study. Its establishment was inspired by Hon. 
Henry Barnard, LL. D., that able, early, and indefatigable educational 
worker. Hon. John D, Philbrick was principal for two years, but the 
public support was neither intelligent nor steady. However, atter 
varying fortune, the people gave it their confidence, and the present 
principal, Prof. Clarence Carroll, has been cordially supported in his 
efficient efforts to furnish for the teachers of the State the best training 
of the day in the best methods and principles of instruction known in
-P-A-G-E-1075
    EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1065 
kindergarten and the several advanced grades of the publie schools. 
The success of the school has led lately to the establishment of another, 
and had no small share in promoting the formation of training classes 
in several of the cities, such as that in Norwich. The effect of this 
normal training in the best methods is manifest in all parts of the 
exhibition. The five alcoves in which the exhibits are grouped by 
towns are: (1) Willimaitic; (2) New Britain, Middletown; (3) Stamford, 
Torrington, Norwich, Bristol; (4) Waterbury, Saybrook, Colchester, 
Hartford; (5) New Haven, Bridgeport. 
The Willimantic normal training school exhibit showed exercises 
in primary reading prepared and illustrated by the teachers for the 
children in the model schools; models for use in manual training; 
material and aids for teaching arithmetic, history, civil government, 
literature, and geography. On the north wall of the alcove are many 
drawings by pupils from 6 years of age and older. These drawings are 
all connected with and illustrate subjects in other studies. The exhib. 
its from the New Britain normal training school were largely made up of 
drawings and color work. Work was shown by pupils from the kin. 
dergarten to the grammar schools, comprising nature work, illustration, 
sketching, perspective, decorative, and original work in illustrating 
selections which they have read. A set of modified sloyd models were 
shown, aud with them the work of children between 7 and 15 years of 
age, the work of the normal pupils, and a set of homemade apparatus 
for illustrating science teaching. Specimens of the work of children 
from 8 to 10 years of age in clay modeling were also shown. The nor- 
mal department of the Norwich Free Academy exhibited a chart show- 
ing its inception and course of study, and another showing methods in 
reading and books prepared by the normal pupils outlining methods in 
reading, number, physics, zoology, botany, and mineralogy. 
The Broad street school, Norwich, used as a training school for the 
normal department, exhibited outlines for literature lessons and color 
lessons in primary grades, a plan for history lessons and for zoology 
lessons, and an outline of the work actually done in the kindergarten 
for the year. In folios were shown children’s work in color. kindergar- 
ten, history, literature, and primary reading, in connection with history 
for children one year in school. 
The Norwich city schools showed outlines for teaching arithmetic, 
history, language, literature, and geography. A large putty map of 
Norwich and another of the United States, made by pupils in the last 
year of the grammar school, and a large “ production” map by pupils 
of the third class, also a set of booklets and illustrated journeys in 
geography, a scrapbook of geographical pictures, and a collection of — 
maps. There were also typical lessons in geography, arithmetic, his- 
tory, and botany. Necessarily there was much sameness in the mate- 
rial from different schools of the same grade, but this was the basis 
for comparison by visitors; and yet, all can not be here repeated in 
detail.   
 
-P-A-G-E-1076
      1066 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
In addition, it may be mentioned that Middletown showed: an out- 
line of science teaching and a collection of specimens used in natural 
history, zoology, botany, ete.; also plans for teaching vocal music, and 
the individual work of pupils, and plans for reading in connection with 
science studies; Bristol, aids in geography and science and geography 
combined, and a scrapbook illustrating geography and sloyd, the result 
of twenty-five hours’ instruction; Waterbury, a chart showing. the story 
of the flag; Hartford, designs and folded forms in inventional geome- 
try, teacher’s outline of lessons in history, and stenographie reports of 
lessons; New Haven, map drawing by the meridian system, and original 
drawing illustrating literature, history, science, and geography. Charts 
were used effectively in connection with various subjects. There was 
good evidence of progress in manual training for boys and girls in vari- 
ous schools. There were excellent specimens of sloyd. 
A substantially complete set of the works of Hon. Henry Barnard, 
LL. D., was a unique feature of the exhibit. This was a rare collection 
of educational literature, containing the treatment of every variety of 
educational topics by the ablest thinkers from the earliest periods in 
different nations, together with much of the history of the various edu- 
cational institutions and systems. It included (@) copies of his official 
reports while president of colleges in Connecticut, Rhode Island, Wis- 
eonsin, Maryland, and as United States Commissioner of Education 
at Washington; (b) the American Journal of Education, Volumes I to 
XXXI; (¢) a set of his Library of Education, and (d) other publica- 
tions, including Tractates and Treatises. Itis a monument to the zeal, 
scholarship, industry, and self-sacrifice of a great educational leader. . 
The exhibit of high school work showed how these institutions open 
up the way in the publie school system for the poor as well as the rich 
to the advantages of superior instruction. This instruction in the State 
was represented by Yale University. The exhibit was composed mainly * 
of photographs, which gave an idea of the numerous and imposing 
buildings and varied opportunities fer culture now furnished by that 
great university. There is little in the present imposing conditions to 
suggest the humble beginning, when the ministers of the colony, anx- 
jous for a school of higher learning, to their conferences each brought 
treasures from his own library, and as he laid them down said: “I give 
these books for the founding of a college in this colony.” It was ehar- 
tered, not by royalty but by the colony, in 1701, asa “collegiate school,” 
and located at Saybrooke. Its first building was erected at New 
Haven, to which place it was removed in 1716, and becoming a college 
in name as well as in fact, was known as Yale College, after its largest 
* early benefactor, from 1718 witil 1887, when, having for some time dene 
the work of a university, the title Yale University was legalized by 
the legislature. Its history is full of instruction. Great difficulties 
were encountered, great sacrifices were made, great men were found 
equal to every occasion, and its light never failed, but grew in Mlumi-

nating power, becoming abeacon not only to individuals. and generations - 
but to the nations of the earth. The college adhered to its own line: 
of thorough work, advancing its standard as: circumstances-warranted,. 
and gradually there came to it a school of theology, of medicine, ef law,. 
of science, and of art, with their special laboratories, libraries, museums,. 
halls, and funds; but the college secured preeminent attention and by 
far the largest attendance. In more recent years the Sheffield school of. 
science, the law school, and other attached schools, as well as miscella- 
neous post-graduate studies, have made great advances in importance 
and numbers. The Sheffield Scientific School, named for. its principal 
early benefactor, founded in 1847 and reorganized on a more extensive 
seale in 1860, has the benefit of the United States grant of lands to Con- 
necticut for the establishment of a college of agriculture and mechanic 
arts, save that expended on the Sterrs school. Under President Tim- 
othy Dwight, who assumed the office in 1886, grandson of a most 
eminent president, the number in attendance in the entire university 
increased in the first six years-of his administration from 1,076 to 1,969 
and in the first four years of his presidency the university received. 
$1,244,390. It is stated that the average age of students at entrance 
for the first fifty years was 17, and that for the succeeding fifty years 
the average age was less; now it is over 18, so that most graduates are 
over 22 years of age. 
The list of graduates contains the names of 1 Vice-President of the 
United States, 17 cabinet officers, 1 chief justice of the United States, 
1 chief justice of Canada, 2 national officers of the Hawaiian Islands, 1 
minister plenipotentiary from China to the United States, 3 judges of the: 
United States Supreme Court, 1 surgeon-general of the United States 
Army, 50 United States Senators, 20 United States district judges, 1 
cireuit judge of the United States, 22 ministers plenipotentiary of the 
United States, 160 State judges, 4 chancellors, 187 members of Con- 
gress, 40 State governors, and 92 college presidents. Four Yale men— 
Livingston, Morris, Wolcott, and Hall—signed the Declaration of Inde- 
pendence. Thesame number, Dyer, Livingston, Johnson, and Baldwin, 
signed the Federal Constitution. In histery Yale is represented by 
Trumbull, Holmes, and Pitkin; in geography by Morse; in poetry by 
Percival, Hillhouse, Barlow, Trumbull, Stedman, and Sill. In litera- 
ture we find such names as Cooper, Willis, Judd, Bristed, and Mitchell; 
in. scholarship, Webster, Worcester, Woolsey, Hadley, and Whitney. 
Silliman, Morse, Eli Whitney, Dana, Chauvenet, Loomis, and Marsh 
are among Yale’s famous sons in science and invention, Edwards, 
Hopkins, Bellamy, Emmons, Dwight, Stuart, Bushnell, Taylor, Mur- 
dock, Beecher, Nettleton, Tyler, and Seabury in divinity; Gallaudet and 
Cogswell in the education of the deaf and dumb. In polities and law 
we find such names as Kent, Jeremiah Mason, Grimke, Evarts, Waite, 
Tilden, and Depew; in philosophy, among others, Noah Porter, Henry 
N. Day, and William T. Harris; among the missionaries, John Sergeant 
and David Brainerd.

  1068 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
But Yale’s chief pride is that, like Virginia of old, she is a mother of 
presidents. Except Harvard, there are few prominent colleges which 
have not had at one time or another a Yale man at their head. The 
first presidents of the following colleges and universities were Yale 
men: Princeton, Columbia, Dartmouth, Williams, Hamilton, University 
of Georgia, Kenyon, University of Illinois, Wabash, University of Mis- 
souri, University of Mississippi, University of Wisconsin, Beloit, Chi- 
cago University, University of California, Cornell, and Johns Hopkins. 
Iowa University, Washington University, University of Pennsylvania, 
College of South Carolina, Transylvania College of Eastern Tennessee, 
Hampden-Sydney, Beyroot, and Oahu have also had one Yale president. 
Many colleges were not content with one Yale man at their head, 
but came to that source of supply again and again. Columbia has 
had 3 Yale men as president; Rutgers, 2; Princeton, 3; University 
of Vermont, 2; Middlebury, 2; Hamilton, 5; Western Reserve, 3; Illi- 
nois, 2; University of Wisconsin, 2; University of Missouri, 2; Wash- 
ington University, 2; and the universities of California, Georgia, and 
Mississippi, each 2. Not only in numbers but in character do Yale 
educators stand foremost. Among them are Jonathan Dickinson, 
Samuel Johnson, Jonathan Edwards, Aaron Burr, Timothy Dwight, 
Theodore D. Woolsey, Noah Porter, Henty Barnard, Francis A. P. 
Barnard, Andrew D. White, Charles J. Stillé, Daniel C. Gilman, and 
William T. Harris. No picture of Yale would be natural without bring- 
ing into view its beautiful elms. Willis fitly said: 
If you were to set a poet to make a town with carté blanche as to trees, gardens, 
and green blinds, he would probably turn out very much such a place as New Haven. 
The first thought of the inventor of New Haven was to lay out the streets in squares; 
the second was to plant them from suburb to water side with the magnificent elms 
of the country. The result is that, at the end of fifty years, the town is buried in 
trees. 
In September, 1803, the corporation passed a vote to which the 
campus owes much of its beauty, “that trees should be set out next 
spring on both sides of the college buildings, in such order as shall 
best conduce to convenience and beauty,” and thus Yale has her elms, 
and every. “true-hearted son of St. Elihu loves the spot where the 
elm tree grows.” The control of the university is vested in the corpora- 
tion, which is composed of the president and eighteen fellows. The 
administration is in the hands of the president and the faculties of the 
several departments. The number of professors, instructors, and lec- 
turers for the year 1892-93 was 185. The total number of students, 
1892-93, was 1,969, coming from 45 States and Territories and 16 
foreign countries. 
The two undergraduate departments, the college and the scientific 
school, together numbered 1,495, coming from more than 300 preparatory 
schools. The graduate and professional schools numbered 474 students, 
coming from 105 colleges and universities. 
The number of degrees in course conferred in 1392 was 5:

NEW YORK. 
The educational exhibit of the State of New York, under the super- 
vision of Prof. M. Dewey, secretary of the board of regents, presented, 
systematically, educational methods and results in all departments, 
from the kindergarten to the university, comprehending institutions of 
secondary, superior, and professional instruction, under the board of 
regents, and all schools; including those for the training teachers, 
under the direction of the superintendent of public instruction. It 
occupied. 1,200 square feet of floor space; the partitioning and furniture 
were of oak; the upholstering was in purple, the State color. The - 
classification was graded, presenting, year by year, a collective and 
comparative exhibit of school work from the various parts of the State. 
Its arrangement sought to typify the organization, peculiar to New 
York, of departments and institutions. A system of signs, labels, and 
numbers, indexes and cross references, was used for the purpose of 
calling attention to allied exhibits. Experts were in attendance, speak- 
ing the principal foreign languages, who courteously answered ques- 
tions. Much explanatory literature was freely distributed. It was 
sought to make the exhibit an attractive head quarters for New York 
educators. The exposition of the organization, government, and work 
of the kindergarten, primary, and grammar grades was made from 
material gathered from various parts of the State including Syracuse, ~ 
Poughkeepsie, Rochester, New York City, Binghamton, Plattsburg, 
Cohoes, Buffalo, and Albany. Secondary instruction was exhibited by 
photograph, specimens of work, courses of study, and other explana- 
tions from over three hundred academies, high schools, and union 
schools, under the regents of the University of the State of New York; 
also a similar display from other institutions of the same grade. The 
normal schools were illustrated by photograph, illustrative work, cour- 
ses of study, methods, and teaching devices from eleven of these 
institutions. 
The photographic, historical, statistical, and literary display of col- 
leges and universities was shared by Columbia College, Cornell Univer- 
sity, University of the City of New York, Vassar College, Rochester 
University, Hamilton College, Colgate University, Teachers’ College, 
College of the City of New York, and Normal College. 
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, New York trade schools, and Roches-- 
ter Atheneum and Mechanie’s Institute presented specimens of all 
departments of their work, including statistics and historical and other 
illustrative photographs. The University of the State of New York 
made an extensive and systematic display of the organization, govern- 
ments, and methods of each of its six departments, known as execu 
tive, examination, extension, State library, State museum, and publie 
libraries. 
University extension was set forth in a valuable collection, showing 
forms, methods, and examination for University of the State of New

York, Chautauqua Circle, Catholic Summer School, University of 
Chicago, University of Edinburgh, and People’s Palace, London, and 
other centers, both domestic and foreign. The exhibit included 3,500 
photographs of school grounds, exteriors and interiors of buildings, 
groups, classes at work, ete. 
The collection included 900 volumes of specimens of students’ work 
in all grades, certified as the regular work of the classes, and not 
“improved” for the occasion. The phonograph gave reproductions of 
the methods of teaching music in schools, with illustrative songs, 
choruses, ete., from the cities of Albany, Rochester, Syracuse, and New 
York. There was a graded display of work in manual training from 
the Albany high school, Newburg Free Academy, New York public 
schools, and Teachers’ College. There were exhibited minimum and 
standard sets of approved scientific apparatus required by the regents 
of the university for schools of secondary instruction; also a graded 
display of models of homemade apparatus for illustrating scientific 
experiments. Administrative blanks and forms for study were col- F 
        lected from the cities, towns, schools, and colleges, as printed for use in 
school government. 
E - The growth of education in the State was shown Dy 100 graphic 
and printed charts. A series of 53 handbooks was on hand for distri- 
bution, giving the history, equipment, and courses of study of various 
institutions and systems. A large educational map showed the location, 
grade, and support of every educational institution under the regents 
F of the university and the department of public instruction. Many 
F historical relics, curios, paintings, and busts added special interest to 
the exhibition. 
: The opportunity to study adequately rural schools of the State was 
_ wanting. City systems received considerable attention. New York 
City exhibited its ward schools in four divisions; first, work in common 
branches of the primary schools; second, work in the common branches 
of the grammar schools; third, manual training in the primary schools; 
fourth, manual training in the grammar schools. Separate exhibits 
showed the work of the college of the city, which crowns the system 
of instruction for boys, so long well known for its efficiency; and the 
normal college in which is given the most advanced instruction fur- 
nished girls by the city, and where they may receive training in prep- 
aration for teaching. 
Supervision in this system has received marked recognition, as is 
manifested by the salaries paid. The wisdom of this supervision has 
done much to relieve the system of instruction for so large a number 
of the tendency to machine work, and to afford larger room for individ- | 
ual and spontaneous action of teachers and pupils. In some instances , 
it is claimed that the work is done well in seven years that otherwise 
would take nine. 4 
      
 
-P-A-G-E-1081
  EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1071 
The imperfection of the system is seen mainly in its inadequacy. 
Tt does not. furnish sufficient sittings; it does not enforce the educa- 
tion of every child; it allows wayward children to grow up a peril to 
society; it allows children of foreign birth or foreign parents to grow 
up without being Americanized. 
The exhibit of the College of the City of New York set forth the 
advanced instruction furnished for young men by the public system, 
and that of the normal college what opportunities are afforded by it 
for the advanced instruction for young women and their preparation as 
teachers. The growth and work of each furnish interesting studies for 
the educator. The college for young men takes the place of the acad- 
emy and is its outgrowth. The normal college is a more recent growth 
out of the grammar school, which came through the wisdom and effi- 
ciency of that eminent teacher, Miss Lydia Wadleigh. She took upon 
herself the additional labor of furnishing the instruction desired of her 
by young women, until the demand for it and the expediency of giving 
it were so manifest that it could no longer be deferred, and the normal 
college was provided. 
In Rochester the free academy still remains, and holds close relation. 
with the university there as well as with other college work in the State. 
In Albany, the Albany Academy, greatly honored by the name of 
Prof. Joseph Henry, and later by that of Dr. Murray, whose service for 
education_in Japan won world-wide recognition, and still later by that 
of Merrill E. Gates, once president of Rutgers College, New Jersey, 
and now president of Amherst, Massachusetts, maintains its excellent 
work. Here the high school has grown up and performed its great 
work for a large number of young people. At first it was claimed that 
the high school was not needed, and its establishment was sharply 
antagonized, the mayor at that time attempting to prevent it. In 
the argument for it, the facts were specially drawn from the national 
Bureau of Education. But once established, and guided by the wis- 
dom of its efficient principal, Prof. J. D. Bradley, ib was found that it 
had a great work to do for the city, altogether in harmony with the 
academy. 
In Buffalo much excellent work is done by the public school, but 
the efficiency of the system has been embarrassed by too close connec- 
tion with the general municipal administration. 
In the Rochester exhibit the kindergarten of the city was effectively 
shown. 
The entire normal school work of the State was not fully exhibited. 
The visitor naturally looked for the work of the pioneer normal school 
' that received so much of its early inspiration under D. P. Page, whose: 
theory and practice of teaching has done so much to uplift the profes- 
sion throughout the country.

THE RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE. 
The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute attracted special attention. 
Nothing connected with it awakened more interest and more strongly 
emphasized the value of its instruction than the partial record furnished 
of the work of its graduates. It was founded by. Hon. Stephen Van 
Rensselaer in 1824, and during the sixty-nine years of its history it 
has adhered strictly to the idea of a thorough school of engineering. 
The results, found in what its graduates have accomplished, are most 
gratifying. It is difficult, of course, to secure all data of alumni, but an 
approximately full summary of particularsis given. Irom thisitappears 
that there have been numbered among the graduates of the institute 
at least 33 presidents, 121 vice-presidents, managers, and superintend- 
ents, and 69 chief engineers of railroad companies, steel and iron works, 
bridge companies, waterworks, electric companies, mining companies, 
sewerage systems, canals, etc. The register shows, besides, that 56 of 
the graduates have been professors in 35 institutions of learning; that 
its graduates have assisted in the design or construction of 44 of the 
great bridges of this country, and in the construction of over 109,000 
miles of railroad in North America. The register includes a list of 
those who have been State geologists, but does not name those who 
have attained eminence in other branches of science and engineering, 
not easily classified. 
  PRATT INSTITUTE. “ 
This institute was founded by the generosity of Charles Pratt, esq., 
and is located in Brooklyn, N. Y. This exhibit was favorably located 
and well installed. It was of extreme interest to all who studied it, 
but. especially to those who are familiar with Mr. Pratt’s life, from 
the days of his own manual labor, through the years of his suecessful 
struggles to the accumulation of millions, and had witnessed his 
numerous and patient investigations, preparatory to carrying out the 
purpose to establish an institution in which others struggling as he 
had in his early years might receive the instruction and aid which 
he could not find. There was nothing visionary in his plans. He had 
come to realize the power of education as applied to industry and the 
common duties of life. R 
Every department of the exhibit showed honesty of work, clear 
apprehension of the theoretical principles involved, and industry and 
fidelity in their execution. ‘The exhibit was a credit to founder, 
teacher, and pupil. 
In addition to studying out a wise plan for the administration of the 
institute, Mr. Pratt set apart, in the most careful manner, properties 
whose income is to be devoted to its administration and growth. He 
was also thoughtful of the future, as indicated in the manner in which 
he associated his sons in its administration. 
The object of the institution has been specifically stated to be the 
promotion of manual and industrial education, as well as cultivation in

literature, science, and art; to inculcate habits of industry and thrift, 
and to foster all that makes for right living and good citizenship. 
In accordance with these principles, the work of the institute is 
prosecuted upon four several lines, with four distinct aims in view: 
(1) Educational, pure and simple; the purpose being the harmonious 
development of. the faculties, as in the work of the high school. 
(2) Normal, the ultimate aim being the preparation of the student 
to become a teacher. Normal training is at present given in the 
department of art, of domestic science, of domestic art, and of kinder- 
gartens. 
(3) Technical or special training to secure practical skill in the vari- 
ous branches of industrial and domestic art, the handicrafts, and the 
mechanical trades. 
(4) Supplementary and special, intended for the benefit of those who 
wish to supplement the training of school or college by attention to 
special subjects conducing to more intelligent direction of domestic, 
financial, social, or philanthropical interests; such training as is given 
in the kindergarten, domestic science, library school, and other classes. 
The institute is provided with a liberal endowment, which enables it 
to make a merely nominal charge for tuition, and at the same time to 
secure the best talent and facilities for the accomplishment of its aim 
and purpose. 
Pratt Institute occupies four large buildings—the main building, the 
high school building, the science and technology building, and the 
trade school building. Ground has already been broken for another 
building, which shall contain large additional accommodation for 
students, as well as for the public features of the institute work, such 
as museum, auditorium, lecture halls, and library. 
The institute is under the control of a board of trustees, with a secre- 
tary as executive officer, It is divided into departments, the director 
of each being directly responsible for the work thereof. 
Instruction is given to: both sexes in day and evening classes. The 
terms for day classes extend from September to July, and for the even- 
ing from October to April. 
The first class was organized October 16, 1887, and numbered 12 
pupils in drawing. At present there are 9 different departments with 
a total enrollment of 3,940 pupils. 
MISS HUNTINGDON’S KITCHEN GARDEN. 
The kitchen garden was devised and developed by Miss Emily Hunt- 
ingdon, of Norwich, Conn., when she was superintendent of the Wilson 
Mission, 125 St. Mark’s Place, New York City. It may be said to be a 
suggestion from the kindergarten. Miniature table, dishes, and other 
articles of use in the kitchen and dining room, are supplied and the 
little girls are trained in their care and use. The exercises are made 
attractive and the practice has proved exceedingly helpful as a prep-

aration. Girls go from this training with great advantage to the actual 
eare of the house, and for women, young and old, who have had no 
opportunity for learning to perform these household duties in a neat 
and orderly way, this method of training has been found one of the 
most effective yet devised. 
A lesson trunk has been prepared for the transportation of the nec: 
essary articles of use. This may be furnished to a school or class. The 
operation as exhibited in the Children’s Building is thus described: 
A visit from this trunk is to be considered a reward. It is to be sent 
locked by a teacher or missionary where it has been merited in some 
way, and is to be used not only as an object lesson, but for the actual 
serving of a simple meal for a family of six. The teacher can carry the 
key when she takes the food, which should be something that the chil- 
dren would enjoy without being too expensive or elaborate, never cost- 
ing more than $1 for the supper. The teacher should pack her basket 
neatly, as an example, and observe the following rules in using the 
outfit: 
Q. How do you place six people at a table? 
. One at each end and two on each side. 
. Who sits at the end places? 
. The parents or elder members of the family. 
. Who pours the tea? 
. Tho mother. 
. Who serves the meat? 
A. The father. 
Q. Tell just how the trunk table should be set: 
A. (1) Lay the cloth straight; (2) place the knives and forks and spoons—kniyes at 
the right, as you use them with the right hand; spoons also; forks at the left. You 
eut with the knife and eat with the fork; (3) arrange one end with teapot, milk 
pitcher, and sugar bowl at the right-hand side, and the six mugs in two neat rows 
at the left hand of the ono who is to serve tea or coffee; (4) put plates in places, 
salt and pepper in the center if there is nothing prettier, putting the food on last— 
the meat to be served at the opposite end from the cups, and the other plates of 
food at intervals between. Now it is ready. 
Q. When are the children ready ? 
A. When faces and hands and hair are neat. 
Q. Hew should they be seated? 
A. All at the same time. 
Ask a blessing. Let the children pass things to each other, and teach them to 
serve the side dishes neatly and politely. Gradually teach them to begin and finish 
eating as nearly together as possible. Those that are through first must sit nicely 
and wait for the others to finish. When through, ask some of the children to help 
elear up and wash the dishes. 
Q. How should we prepare for washing dishes? 
A. (1) We tie on our aprons. Set away seats from the table and take up any bits of 
erumbs that may be on the floor. Then push the dishes to one side, making a clear 
place on the table, on which place the empty dish pan. Empty cups, pitcher, and 
teapot, and place on the table at the right-hand side of the pan. Spoons and knives 
and forks place on an empty platter or plate. Scrape plates and place them in a 
pile. Then the other dishes. Now get the hot water and make the suds by putting 
a piece of soap on a fork and stirring briskly in the water.

  EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1075 
Q. How do you wash these dishes? 
A. The spoons, then the cups, then the pitchers, then the teapots, then the platter, 
then the other dishes, last the knives and forks, rubbing off the spots with a piece 
of raw potato. As the pan is small, get clean water often, and as hot as possible. 
Now get clean water to wash the towels and pan and put to dry before packing. 
Wipe the enamel cloth nicely. Pack trunk and leave locked to be returned to the 
school. 
One teacher writes of the use of the trunk and lesson: 
Ibegan with the children I knew had never sat down to a table to eat a meal in their 
lives. They acted awkwardly, of course, and I think would have enjoyed the good 
things better could they have taken them in their fingers and stood around. Yet I 
feel that that meal willlong beremembered. The parents looked on in open-mouthed 
wonder. They were as much delighted as the children. Such beautiful mugs and 
pretty plates, and those knives and forks and spoons, were complete wonders, 
SCHOOL OF APPLIED DESIGN FOR WOMEN. 
(No. 200 West Twenty-third street, New York.) 
The exhibit of this school called attention to an educational enter- 
prise of rare merit. Miss Ellen J. Bond, secretary, under date of 
November 10, 1893, sets forth the facts and expectations as follows: 
The New York School of Applied Design for Women was founded a year ago, its 
object being to enlarge the field for women of thorough practical, technical design- 
ingin all branches. This object it is impossible to attain unless the student comes in 
direct contact with the manufacturer and the trade; therefore the instructors of cach 
department are the head paid designers of the greatest manufacturing estabiishments 
in the city. 
The unprecedented success of this scheme of instruction isshown in the fact that 
we now have 300 students, and in the month of February, 1893, when the school was 
but five months old, $1,500 worth of designs were sold, the entire amount of which 
went to the students. We already occupy a large four-story building and are about 
to fill another of the same size. 
Our students come from 25 States, from Texas to Oregon and from Maine to Florida. 
Talent is irrespective of location and springs up at all points of the compass. 
The school is divided into two departments—the clementary for drawing and the 
advanced for designing. All students are required to pass an examination in the ele- 
mentary instruction before entering the advanced courses, The advanced depart- 
ment is divided into several branches—the application of design to wall paper, carpets, 
silks, rugs; and the application of the elementary instruction to illustrating, etching 
and lithography, and to the work of an architect draftsman. The latter branch is 
especially adaptable to women, and we have received a gold medal from the World’s 
Fair for our work in this department, as well as medals for other departments. 
We are now finishing plans for a hospital in San Francisco to cost $30,000, and a 
large building for offices for London, to cost $300,000, the first building in England 
built by woman. These we got in competition with several architectural firms, and 
we are always glad to have the privilege of competing on any work done in an archi- 
tect’s office. 
The first six months’ work has been specially successful, The best judges have 
eommended it in strong terms. 
Students have received offers for positions in architects’ offices, even before they 
have completed the course of two years’ instruction required by the school to fit 
them as draftsmen.   
 
-P-A-G-E-1086
    1076 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Our designs have been purchased by English firms as fast as finished, and we 
have orders ahead until March, 1894. We have filled many positions in various 
cities, in all of which women receive tho same salaries as men. 
This is the only school in the world in which the instructors are the paid head 
designers in the largest manufactories and architects’ offices in the country. 
The school is self-supporting (a phenomenal record), and the directors intend it to 
be the greatest trade school for women in the world. 
NEW JERSEY. 
The excellent plans adopted at the start by the State of New Jersey 
for the educational exhibit are worthy of note. General charge of the 
subject was given to a committee of the State board, composed of 
W.R. Barricklo, chairman; Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, and John 
M. Scudder. 
There was also a strong executive committee of educators appointed, 
with Hon. Addison B. Poland, State superintendent of public instruc- 
tion, as chairman, and including such well-known names as educators 
as Principal Green and Superintendents Barringer, Spalding, Schnider, 
and others. 
A special committee was assigned to the direct care of preparing the 
exhibits in different subjects, such as: 
School ground and buildings.—Supt. Vernon L. Davey, chairman, 
with a number of excellent associates. 
Statistics.—Principal Augustus Scarlett, chairman, ete. 
Kindergarten.—Supt. B. C. Gregory, chairman. 
Drawing.—Langton 8. Thompson. 
Manual training.—Horatio Draper. 
Natural science-—Austin O. Apgar, chairman, ete. 
There were eleven of these committees. Each committee sent out its 
circulars of instructions, and for general purposes the whole were 
bound together. Apparently from the start, no matter what uncertain- 
ties or difficulties were encountered, there was an intelligent and fixed 
purpose to get the most for the State out of the opportunity, and a 
well-defined plan of what to do within the State and what to do at Chi- 
cago. So great was the interest aroused that the committee reports 
measures had to be taken to discourage too extensive participation in 
the preparation of material, and had all participated who desired to 
take part the 10,000 square feet of space originally asked for would 
have been insufficient. As might have been expected, the exhibit was 
one of special value, and received marked approval both from the board 
of judges and visiting educators. Twelve cities and nine counties held 
home exhibitions of their collections before sending them to Trenton 
for shipment to Chicago. These home exhibitions were very much 
appreciated and were salutary in that effect. Before forwarding the 
material to Chicago it was carefully inspected and classified; very little 
was rejected.
-P-A-G-E-1087
  EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1077 
The participation of country schools is remarkable. Every one of 
the 24 districts in Union County took part, sending 5,033 specimens. 
Of the 71 districts in Somerset County 50 participated. 
The expense of the exhibit should not be forgotten. The State fur- 
nished paper, binding, and transportation, and paid for installation 
and care and printing. Fortunately S. R. Morse, for a long time the 
efficient superintendent of schools for Atlantic County, and his wife 
were secured as custodians of the exhibit. To their intelligent over- 
sight and tireless industry the success of the State exhibit is in no small 
measure due. As might have been expected, the exhibit was not only 
one of special value, but received marked approval both from the 
judges and visiting educators. The lack of room Jed to the invention 
and use of the New Jersey school cabinet, a device which it is said 
increased more than thirtyfold the extent of the available space. It 
consisted of a case 36 by 28 inches, having a glass door, and contain-— 
ing a series of 15 wing frames swinging upon hinges, each frame 
designed to contain 2 large cardboards 22 by 28 inches, upon which 
exhibits were mounted. When closed, these cabinets preserved the 
exhibits from injury by dust and exposure; when opened, by simply 
turning like the leaves of a book, 32 frames of exhibits were succes- 
sively presented to the eye of the observer. It was admitted by 
all who inspected the New Jersey exhibit that this device for multiply- 
ing available space was one of the most unique and valuable contribu- 
tions made by any State or country to the educational department of 
the World’s Fair. 
Considering the large amount of labor involved, the result was so - 
satisfactory—as remarked by the committee, only by reason of having 
the exhibit so thoroughly planned, organized, and classified, the furni- 
ture and furnishings so perfectly fitted to their place, and use before 
being forwarded from Trenton—that it was only necessary to unpack 
and set up the exhibit in conformity with the plan adopted in order to 
make it complete. 
The variety of points of excellence recognized in the awards is worthy 
of special note. For Atlantic County it is said ‘‘the course of study 
and the system of graduating pupils are excellent.” A special award 
is given to Miss Lottie Gertrude Johnson, of Trenton, for showing an 
original way of interesting young children in the study of music. In 
general, in the public schools of that city, it is declared an excellent 
system of supervision has made its good effects manifest in music, lan- 
guage, science, drawing, and kindergarten. The public schools of Vine 
land are commended for intelligent instruction and good progress in 
school work in all grades, especially work in wood carving. Cumber- 
land County public schools receive an award for excellence of work, 
showing progress in rural and village schools. Burlington County 
public schools, it is affirmed, are good generally, but especially in mathe- 
matics and language. Inconnection with Ehzabeth, attention is called 
 
-P-A-G-E-1088
    1078 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93, 
to the manifestly good teaching, making special mention of merit in 
reading, English composition, and in the study of German. Of Newark, 
for thorough and accurate work in primary, grammar, and high schools. 
Of Jersey City elementary schools special mention is made of speci- 
mens in natural science, gathered and prepared by pupils, and in the 
study of geography, in which countries are illustrated by maps, and 
careful preparation of their products, together with manuscripts de- 
scriptive of the same. The manual training in Camden is commended 
for excellence of work generally, and specially, first, in mechanical and 
perspective drawing; second, superiority in carpentry; third, variety 
in skillful designs, and for execution in forging. Newark is noted 
for excellence and improvement in mechanical, architectual, and free- 
hand drawing. Plainfield, for systematic teaching in all grades, fitting 
students in Latin and Greek to enter college, and also preparing them 
- for business. The school for the feeble-minded is commended for full 
and instructive showing of the excellent work done for the 1,631 per- 
sous of this class in the State, including organization, appliances, and 
methods, and especially in results as seen, first, by what the pupils have 
accomplished in composition, arithmetic, and other branches of study; 
and second, in the several industries taught. Of the school for the 
deaf there was exhibited a carefully prepared, instructive collection 
showing the good work of the pupils and the efficiency and excellence of 
the instructors. The collection from the single State normal school, 
under Prof. James M. Green, and its model schools was large, varied, 
and very instructive. In language there were 800 specimens; in sing- 
ing, 100 specimens; in pedagogy, 700 specimens; in mathematics, 400 
specimens; in penmanship, 200 specimens; in bookkeeping, 260 speci- 
mens; in geography, 400 specimens; in history, 400 specimens; and a 
Jarge number and of excellent quality in the sciences and in miscellan- 
eous subjects, such as drawing and manual training. The design of 
the exhibit was declared to be to show both method and quality and 
the relations of academic and pedagogical work. 
The committee of the State board of education, remarking upon the 
value of their exhibit, say: 
It is obvious that the attempt to make tangible or even pictorial any considerable 
part of the work of education must of necessity be a partial failure. This arises 
from the intrinsic nature of the educational process. Hence the expenditure of a 
large sum of money and the consumption of a large amount of time by teachers and 
pupils in preparing work for the World’s Fair seemed to many, doubtle 
of effort. 
Admitting all the limitations and diffieulties under which.an educational exhibit 
must be made, nevertheless it is clear to your committee, as it must be toevery careful 
observer, that not only was the exhibit useful in arousing acommendable State pride 
in its schools, but many other direct as well as indirect advantages accrued to the 
schools through participation in the educational display at the World’s Fair. 
Tt should be a matter of intense gratification to the citizens of New Jersey that 
her schools were able to compare so favorably with those of other States and coun- 
tries. Knowledge of the excellence of our State school system has made the desire    , as a waste 
  
 
-P-A-G-E-1089
  EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1079 
to sustain and advance it more intense and universal. Teachers have been encour- 
aged by the favorable comparison of their work with the work of teachers in other 
States; pupils have been made more enthusiastic to excel in their studies. It may 
safely be affirmed that nothing since the last State exhibit at Philadelphia, in 1893, 
has done more to awaken a general interest in education throughout the State than 
the World’s Fair exhibit of 1893. i 
The committee may well congratulate themselves that of the $15,000 appropriated 
by the State for the educational exhibit a balance of $2,500 remained. They print a 
complete catalogue of the several parts of the exhibit and recommend that these 
catalogues be preserved by the respective schools, In regard to the final disposition 
of the exhibit, the committee urged that it be kept intact and be made use of for 
purposes of education within the State. Thousands of persons who were unable to 
visit the World’s Fair would be delighted to see the State school exhibit, and these 
would be greatly benefited if the exhibit were suitably and permanently housed 
where it could be inspected. 
Placed in a State museum at Trenton and made readily accessible, it would be 
visited by teachers, school officers, and pupils from all parts of the State. Renewed 
from time to time by fresh accessions, it would represent for any given date the 
high-water mark of educational progress throughout the State. Your committee 
would, therefore, most strongly urge that a suitable place for a permanent State 
school exhibit be provided by the legislature at its next session. 
The committee very earnestly commend State Superintendent Poland 
in behalf of the exhibition. 
PRINCETON COLLEGE. 
The position given to Princeton College was in the gallery at the 
south end of the Liberal Arts Building, immediately over its main 
central aisle. Harvard University was located on one side of it and 
Columbia College on the other. - 
Tt had at its disposal 2,000 feet of floor space, and about 1,500 square 
feet of wall surface.’ The whole space was divided into two portions 
by the aisle of the gallery. The partition wall surrounding the space 
was 10 feet high. 
The background of the southern space was oceupied by a bookcase 
extending across the whole width of the section (38 feet). This case 
was about 4 feet high, and contained a collection of books aggregating 
some 3,000 volumes, the writings of the alumni and of members of the 
faculty; a series of the college annuals, memorabilia, ete. Above the 
bookease was a series of oil paintings; in the center of the line was the 
large picture of Washington painted by C. W. Peale in 1784, which for 
a century had hung undisturbed in North College. This picture was 
handsomely draped with an American flag. On either side of this 
painting were arranged the portraits of ten distinguished deceased 
presidents of the college, from Dickinson to Maclean. On the side 
walls of this space, facing one another, were handsome crayons of ex- 
President McCosh and President Patton. On the same walls, one on 
_ each side, were the portraits of two Revolutionary governors, Belcher 
and Patterson. The remainder of this wall space was occupied by 
pictures of the college grounds and buildings. Thirty large platino- 
 
-P-A-G-E-1090
    1080 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
types, illustrating all the college buildings, were prepared especially 
for this purpose, and among them was placed a collection of architects’ 
colored sketches of some of the buildings. 
In the center of this space was the model of the college grounds. 
This was a large relief map, showing each building, terrace, and tree 
upon the campus. It measured 8 by 6 feet, and being upon a good 
scale showed the arrangement of the grounds perfectly, forming an 
attractive feature of the exhibit. 
Upon two easels, one on either side of this model, were placed a num- 
ber of interesting college curios. Among thent were the two oldest 
catalogues known to be extant. These were the broadsides of 1805 
and 1818; a commencement programme of 1760, in Latin; a series of 
old diplomas, containing nearly all the signatures of the former presi- 
dents of the college; Professor Guyot’s manuscript map of the dis- 
tribution of the erratic bowlders of Switzerland (1849), aud an original 
manuscript, Physical Map of the World, by Carl Ritter (Berlin, 1806). 
On one of the easels were photographs of the various members of the 
faculty. 
The other space had but two side walls; it was, however, closed upon 
the side toward the edge of the gallery by a handsome arch of open 
grill work, which bore the legend, “ Princeton College, 1746,” upon both 
sides. At its center it supported the arms of the college (taken from 
its seal), surrounded by a group of national and college flags. The effect 
of the arch was very striking, and it was almost impossible for anyone 
to pass through the main aisle of the great building without seeing it, 
as it was one of the most prominent objects in the gallery. 
Upon one of the side walls of this space was placed the exhibits from 
the departments of civil engineering and graphics. The other side 
wall was devoted to the student organizations, the halls, literary mag- 
azines, religious societies, football, lacrosse and gymnastics teams, ete. 
Under the arch was a long table case which contained a series of 
literary treasures from the library, also specimens from the museuin of 
historic art, consisting of samples of engravings, photographs, slides, 
and specimens from the Trumbull-Prime collection of pottery. Across 
the open space next to the aisle was another table case, containing the 
apparatus of Professor Henry and an exhibit from the department of 
physical geography, the first being the world-renowned set of instru- 
ments by means of which Professor Henry’s discoveries in electricity 
were made. The other set consisted of a historical collection of instru- 
ments, some of them unique and others valuable for their associations. 
Among them were Humboldt’s magnetometer, an original Fahrenheit 
thermometer (Amsterdam, 1632), thermometers and barometers used 
by Agassiz and Guyot in their Swiss glacial work, ete. 
In the open space between the walls and the table cases were two tall ° 
cases and the secretary’s desk. One case contained the exhibit of the 
E. M. museum of geology and consisted of rare and, in many instances,
-P-A-G-E-1091
    EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1081 
unique specimens from each of the geographical epochs. There were 
also casts of some of the more valuable things in the museum which 
could not be sent. The other case contained a collection of mounted 
birds, representing the Atlantic Coast species, from the biological mu- 
seum of the John ©. Green school of science. 
The Rittenhouse orrery (1770) was placed upon a platform by itself; 
aud Franklin’s electrical machine and Professor Henry’s great magnet 
were placed near the end of the table case containing the rest of his 
apparatus. Under the engineering and graphics exhibit were some 
construction models, and upon a table were albums containing work 
from the department of graphics. 
The exhibit was intended to cover the history, the activity, and the 
scope of the institution. 
The exhibit was under the charge of Mr. Street (1892). He was well 
supplied with catalogues, directories, and also with the handbook which 
was prepared for free distribution with the purpose of giving concise 
information upon the history of the college, its buildings, its organiza-~ 
tion, and its courses of study. 
PENNSYLVANIA, 
Miss Sarah A. Stewart was in charge of the Pennsylvania education 
exhibit, located in the southwestern corner of the Liberal Arts Build- 
ing at the intersection of the two inside aisles. 
The public schools, academies, colleges, and universities were ar- 
ranged in one group, and occupied 6,525 square feet of space. The 
art schools, in close proximity, covered with their exhibits 3,158 square 
feet of screens. The schools for the defective classes occupied 1,850 
square feet of wall space and a small amount of floor space upon the 
western aisle near by, and the medical schools, located in the south- 
western corner of the same gallery, filled 200 feet of floor space. 
(a) It is claimed that the congregate exhibits of these several classes 
is fairly representative of the educational work which is being done in 
the State. Forty-six cities and counties are represented in the graded 
public school system. The leading cities of the State show a sequen- 
tial development of school work from the first grade through to the high 
school course. The kindergarten, manual training, drawing, form and 
color, serving and cooking are each shown in their relation to the other 
courses of instruction, and mark an advance in educational method. 
Seven normal schools, 4 colleges, 3 universities, 4 art schools, and 3 
medical schocls represent the work which is being done in higher edu- 
cation in a creditable degree. 
(b) The visitor was especially aided who was fortunate enough to 
examine, in common with this exhibit, two series of charts in the 
northeast corner of the same building, showing the scientific status of 
Pennsylvania and its material progress. One was prepared by the 
meteorological committee of Franklin Institute, of Philadelphia, and  
-P-A-G-E-1092
  1082 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
consists of two sets of twelve charts each, one recording the weather 
observations of the institute and the other the same service performed 
with less advantages half a century ago. The other series was pre- 
pared by Mr. Lorin Blodgett, of Philadelphia, and graphically presents 
the wealth of the State as shown by industrial statistics. 
In Pennsylvania the educational system makes prominent the bor- 
ough and the county, instead of the town, as in New England. A 
county superintendent of common schools is elected by school directors 
and commissioned by the State superintendent, who is nominated by 
the governor and confirmed by the senate, and who is the adminis- 
trator of public instruction for the State. The legislature makes the 
appropriations for education, The supervision is first, by the State, 
second by counties, third by cities. A county superintendent is 
required by law to have certain educational qualifications. He is paid 
a salary which is intended to be a reasonable compensation for his ser- 
vices. He devotes himself to the improvement of the schools, visiting, 
examining, making addresses, holding teachers’ institutes, and report- 
_ ing his work to the State superintendent. Supervision has been an 
effective agency for advancing the intelligence of the people. 
Philadelphia was the last large city to adopt supervision, and, 
although the change was resisted by certain influences, it has resulted 
in great benefit to the schools, and is more and more commended by 
intelligent public opinion. The elements of improvement will in time 
leaven the entire educational work of the city. 
The exhibit of the office of State superintendent was not. empha- 
sized, but from its reports and graphics could be learned something 
of the history and scope of its beneficent workings. 
The school products exhibited came mostly from cities. They showed 
careful grading and thoroughness in the long-established essentials of 
common school instruction. The kindergarten exhibit outside of Phil- 
adelphia was limited. From that city there were excellent examples of 
numerous gifts, including folding, weaving, sewing, drawing, molding, 
and modeling. Corry, too, showed good kindergarten specimens. 
Drawing in the elementary schools of the State is fast becoming as 
common as writing. The question of the date at which to begin the 
use of the pencil or pen, or both, has apparently not always been intel- 
ligently settled, but the use of both was generally good in the lower 
grades. From Pittsburg, Altoona, Reading, Titusville, Williamsport, 
and other smaller places there were good nature and geographical draw- 
ings; from Harrisburg, an alcove of construction, life, model, and design; 
from Philadelphia, the subject selected, illustrative of the growth of 
our country, deserves commendation. 
Special attention was attracted to the music work of Altoona and 
the fine collection of language work from some of the grammar schools. 
The subjects of language lessons are generally well chosen from nature 
or objects or acts within the observation of the pupils; sometimes a

picture is used to advantage. Reading showed good lessons on plants 
and animals. 
The one volume of bookkeeping from Allegheny seemed lonesome, it 
had so few companions. 
The exhibit from the State left the impression that high school work 
needs greater emphasis; that more centers of population should have 
high schools. The benefits derived from this grade of instruction where 
it as been enjoyed would seem to afford sufficient argument for its 
adoption wherever the number of pupils warrantsit. The efficiency and 
strength of high school work in Philadelphia and Pittsburg have long 
been conspicuous. It will be remembered that long after the establish- 
ment of the boys’ high school in Philadelphia Judge Kelley, then on 
the bench, was able to say that up to that date not one of the graduates 
had been convicted of crime. 
STATE COLLEGE. 
State College, founded on the national grant in aid of colleges of agri- 
culture and mechanic arts, an institution of growing importance, 
showed “systematic progressive” work in different departments. Penn- 
sylvania has not a State university. This college under the patronage 
of the State and its able president nay yet fill that place. The exhibit 
indicates how closely it has sought to follow the law for the establish- 
ment of these institutions. : 
Drawing has been well developed, especially in its applications. The 
agricultural experiment station showed good results; there were good 
plans for the improvement of dairy farming; a Chautauqua course of 
reading in agriculture suggests a similar course for minors and mechan- 
ics; model garden tools pointed to improvement in horticulture; port- 
folios contained specimens of students’ work in botany, geology, and 
mineralogy; the exhibition in mechanic arts was elementary. 
The educational work of the State may be further studied in the edu- 
cation of the blind, the deaf-mutes, and the feeble-minded; in the homes 
for children of soldiers, and in the institutions for juvenile offenders, 
SCHOOL FOR FEEBLE-MINDED, 
The school for feeble-minded, under Dr. Isaac N. Kerlin, at Elwyn, 
which received so much notice, called attention to a most deserving 
institution. Dr. Kerlin has been among the most effeetive leaders in 
his efforts to improve the opportunities of this unfortunate class. The 
response his efforts have received from the people of the State is not 
unfitly pointed out as a measure of the progress of our age. None 
familiar with the incapacity of this class of youth can fail to be both 
surprised and gratified at the evidence of the progress they make in 
Jetters, hand work, and conduct, under the skillful and patient training 
of their teachers. In institutions of this character teachers may learn - 
many valuable lessons of the greatest import in the theory and prae- 
tice of teaching. Methods must be analyzed and adapted to the pupils 
to the last degree.

TEACHING SPEECH TO INFANT DEAF-MUTES. 
This exhibition in the Children’s Building is made at the expense of 
the State commissioners from the Home for the Training in Speech of 
Deaf-mute Children before they are of school age, in Philadelphia. The 
school is the result of the skill and sacrifices of Miss Emma Garrett 
and her sister, Miss Mary S. Garrett, and their friends and coadjutors. 
I can not do better than quote the description of the school, written by 
Miss Emma Garrett just before her death in July at the Fair, “caused 
by the overwork, anxiety, and constant strain of fifteen years of unre- 
mitting devotion to the conduct and well-being of the school.” The 
following is the description: 
The work of the home, like the learning to talk of hearing children, goes on through 
the summer as in winter. It was therefore a comparatively easy matter to transfer 
the training nursery work from the home in Belmont avenue, Philadelphia, to the 
Children’s Building at the World’s Fair for the summer. It was also fitting that it 
should appear as a Pennsylvania exhibit, since Pennsylvania was the first government 
in the world to aid deaf children to learn to talk at the natural age, although many 
of our governments are now helping them to learn to talk in the oral schools for the 
deaf. Pennsylvania, however, has recognized that deaf children would lose as much 
as hearing ones if they were not taught to talk until they began to go to school. 
The teaching goes on in the Children’s Building just as at the Home. The chil- 
dren have their backs to the audience, and do not hear them, so they are not embar-* 
rassed by them, although the classes have been visited by people from all parts of the 
world. Among these are many educators and parents of deaf children, who have 
been greatly helped by seeing the actual work. 
There are two classes of twelve each; one is composed of children who have been 
under training since the opening of the home here in February, 1892, and the other 
of little ones who have just entered and those who have been there from a few 
months to a year.   
THE UNIVE: 
  Y OF PEN     SYLVANIA. 
This is an institution whose foundations were laid by Franklin, as is 
often said, or by his inspiration. It is a chartered institution, admin- 
istered by a self-perpetuating board, sustained by private beneficence, 
and therefore is the University of Pennsylvania in name only—a name 
which it is greatly and increasingly honoring. 
Its exhibit preseuted something of its past history and of its present 
work and appliances. Rare specimens were shown from its museums— 
wood, iron, and copper objects from the valley of the Delaware, clay 
tablets, bricks, and an inscribed stone from Babylon, and mummies, his- 
torical inscriptions, and objects in wood, iron, brass, and bone textiles 
.from Egypt. Special attention was drawn to the color mixer, its appa- 
ratus for presenting a flash of white light; its contour apparatus for trac- 
ing the outline of a body, the rate of its movements, and apparatus 
from its laboratory of experimental psychology. The student of its 
exhibit, in the midst of the regard shown for antiquity, was delighted 
with the evidence that the university is specially equipped and anxious 
to deal with the most profound and advanced questions of university 
education in its various departments; that it is making such contri- 
butions to education, to economics, to university extension and other 
live issues of the day.

    EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1085 
The American Society for University Extension is closely associated 
with the university. Dr, Edmund J. James, professor in the university, 
is president of the society. To the extension of advanced information 
and higher thought among the people the university has given itself 
most heartily. The effect has been most salutary. Courses of lectures 
by men of eminence have been delivered, and received with great favor 
in the localities where before such opportunities were rare, or perhaps 
altogether beyond reach. It has brought to many busy people, and 
to those otherwise unable to avail themselves of the advantages of 
superior instruction, the inspiration of the profounder subjects, too, 
whose consideration is often limited to college halls. The intellectual 
horizon is enlarged, aspiring minds catch new clews by which they rise 
to a higher intellectual and moral life. It appears as a new aid to 
sound and healthy self-culture. Science, carried thus freely among the 
people by men well trained in the college or university, adds a measure 
of protection against the charlatanism which too often masquerades in 
the name of science, and imposes upon the public science falsely so 
called. ‘ , 
It is extremely gratifying to observe the successful efforts made by 
the university to add to its museums valuable specimens in different 
departments from the rare collections exhibited at Chicago. 
WESTERN UNIVERSITY. 
From the pictures exhibited the visitor could get a fair idea of the 
exterior and interior views and of the personnel of the faculty, trustees, 
and distinguished alumni. Specimens of drawings made by classes, of 
earpentering and wood turning by the freshman class, and of pipe 
fitting, forging, chipping, and filing by the sophomore class, and 
machine tool work by the junior class, gave evidences of careful atten- 
tion to thorough and systematic instruction in these subjects. The 
mathematical models, by Prof. R. T. Stewart, in wire, plaster, and paper, 
as well as those “transformable,” and those for “folding,” were heartily 
commended as specially helpful. The observatory work deserved 
special attention. The good work of the university deserves special 
consideration from the great accumulated wealth of Allegheny and 
Pittsburg. There is ample room for those who would emulate the 
liberality of the late Hon. William Thaw, whose beneficence in his life- 
time did so much for the university and other widely scattered institu- 
tions of education and charity. 
FRANKLIN AND MARSHALL COLLEGE. 3 
Franklin and Marshall College exhibited documents, catalogues, 
publications, views of the college and its presidents, but nothing which 
attracted more attention than the specimens from its historic collec- 
tion, including the Zurich Bible of 1551, and the Barbara Fritchie 
Bible of 1771, a Roman missal of the twelfth century, and a Luther 
memorial of 1546,

LEHIGH UNIVERSITY. 
The exhibit of Lehigh University brought out well its scheme and 
its results in the work of students. There were views of buildings, 
exteriors and interiors, statistics, charts, maps, publications by the 
university and by its alumni and professors; there were graduating 
theses of students in the classical course, in mechanical, electrical, and 
civil engineering, also in chemistry, mining, and metallurgy, as well as 
notebooks and drawings. No doubt was left on the minds of the care- 
ful observers of the strength of the institution or of the thorough work 
it does in its several departinents of applied science. 
The pleasing effect of the alcoves of Bryn Mawr and the Ogontz 
School caused many a passer-by to pause and examine. 
BRYN MAWR. 
Bryn Mawr showed its models, grounds, and buildings, and the cap 
and gown of the students; also photographs of exterior and interior 
yiews, publications, charts of its statisties, and courses of study for 
undergraduates and graduates, the whole suggesting a certain resem- 
blance to Johns Hopkins University, and giving assurance of a most 
thorough and advanced work for women. Many looked with special 
interest into the scheme for improvement. 
OGONTZ SCHOOL. 
Ogontz School exhibited its flag, pin, memorial spoon, catalogues of 
art exhibits, programmes, views of buildings, of classes at work, but 
especially students’ work in water color, in oil, in black and white, in 
modeling clay, charts of chemical analysis, specimens in botany, and of 
work in astronomy, maps in ancient history, diagram for the study of 
the history of art, notebooks of pupils, compositions in English litera- 
ture, modern history, and history of art. ‘There were desks designed 
expressly for use in the school. The high aims of this school, and its 
sound pedagogical methods and scheme for the education of girls, were 
effectively set forth. 
e GIRARD COLLEGE. 
Girard College exhibit contained pictures of grounds and of interior 
and exterior views of buildings,18 charts in geometrical and construct- 
ive drawing, 13 charts in model object drawing, specimens of work m 
iron and wood, model of a steam engine and of a bridge by the stu- 
dents, giving good illustration of the direction of the institution to the 
purposes of its founder. The work is thorough and systematic, and 
specially suited to fit boys for active pursuits. Conduct is emphasized. 
No clergyman is admitted to the grounds, out of regard for the pro- 
hibition of its founder. But as Webster, the great expounder of the 
American Constitution, showed in his argument in the Girard case that 
our institutions are founded in Christian sentiment, the doctrines of 
Christianity are made the foundation of the careful moral training of
-P-A-G-E-1097
  
  EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1087 
the lads in attendance upon the institution. The institution, although 
designated as a college, it should be remembered, attempts only those 
studies which may be considered preparatory to apprenticeship, and 
not the advanced instruction expected of an American college proper. 
It stands as one of the most conspicuous of our early educational insti- 
tutions enriched with great funds bestowed by private individuals, the 
marvel of those who are accustomed to see such large benefactions 
come from the hands of royalty only. 
SPRING GARDEN INSTITUTE. 
The Spring Garden Institute gained great credit by its exhibit for 
the work it is doing in both day and night schools. Not afew point to 
their training in these excellent schools as the cause of their success 
in life. 
THE SCHOOL OF DESIGN FOR WOMEN, PHILADELPHIA, 
(Miss Emily Sartin, principal.) 
Its ‘collection was large and varied, including silk, china, oilcloth, 
linoleum, cotton prints, stained glass, book covers, book headings, car- 
pets (Brussels and ingrain). The whole was of special merit. Educa- 
tionally the collection was specially deserving. The subjects were 
well chosen and the specimens of work gave evidence of suevessfal 
training. The execution showed taste and skill. There were drawings 
from casts and from life, clay modeling, water colors and oil paintings 
from life. The school exhibited some meritorious work in the Woman’s 
Building. In that building, also, there was much relating to woman’s 
education in the State, women’s training in hospitals, in journalism, 
and archeology; in the library were 400 books by women of the State. 
The exhibit of the Woman’s Medical College, of Philadelphia, 
pointed to an institution of marked efficiency, the annual attendance 
having reached nearly two hundred. The installation cf this exhibit 
was especially effective. 
The Hahnemann Medical College exhibited a collection which 
received marked attention. It showed excellence of equipment of the 
college and hospital, and instructive illustration of the eye, of heart 
and respiratory system, of the brain and nerves of sensation and 
motion, including a rare specimen of actual dissection in one piece of 
the cerebral-spinal nervous system of a human body. 
SANITATION. 
Instruction in sanitary living was especially promoted by the exhi- 
bition of the Philadelphia Workingman’s Horse in Midway Plaisance. 
This is especially credited to Miss Elen Duane Davis. The exhibit 
consisted of a two-story and basement house, and is one of 150,000 
precisely similar homes in the city of Philadelphia. It is claimed that 
in 1890 Philadelphia, with only two-thirds as many people, had twice
-P-A-G-E-1098
    1088 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
as many houses as New York; with just as many people as Chicago, 
it had half as many more houses. In Philadelphia seven families out 
of eight lived in separate houses; in New York the proportion was 
only one family in six; and in Chicago less than one-half the families 
live in separate houses. What the State does for public sanitation 
may be learned in part from the exhibition of the State board of 
health. 
The Woman’s Silk Culture Association gave interesting instruction 
in the Agricultural Building in this important industry, so much . 
neglected in America. The complete process of silk manufacture was 
exhibited—illustrated. ‘There were shown the silk reel, silk loom, and 
the cocoon under the most favorable circumstances. 
The exhibit of the manual training high school of Philadelphia, es- 
tablished under Supt. James MacAlister, LL. D., was deservedly much 
commended. The manual training gave evidence of being conducted 
on sound pedagogical principles, and of fitting admirably the course of 
instruction in the lower grades as well as that of the high schools pre- 
viously established. It created no jar; it was characterized by no fool- 
ishness. This exhibit was especially strong and full. 
The work in manual training from Pittsburg was of good quality. 
There was a notable series of charts from Pittsburg, presenting work 
“in natural science, commercial business, model and constructive draw- 
ing, and in methods in physics and biology. 
The normal schools that have done so great a work for education in 
the State did not do themselves justice in their exhibit. None of them 
were adequately represented. So far as could be seen from their 
exhibits, they are compelled to do a large amount of work in teaching 
the subjects to be taught by their graduates. If the high school work 
of the State could be adequately increased, the normal schools could 
more reasonably devote their efforts. to training in principles and 
methods, and thus specially advance the qualifications of the teachers 
employed in the schools of the State. It is gratifying to find evidence 
“in the exhibit that this change is being made. 
PUBLIC INDUSTRIAL ART SCHOOL, PHILADELPHIA. 
The exhibit of this school was a surprise to many. For a consider- 
able time its principal, J. Liberty Tadd, was present with a pupil to 
illustrate to the eye some of the essential principles of his methods. 
“Beginning with 120 pupils in 1880, the Public Industrial Art School 
now numbers nearly 1,200 pupils and teachers.” It is declared to be 
“no longer an experiment, but an established element of the system of 
public education in Philadelphia.” Mr. Tadd has been associated with 
this movement from its beginning as teacher and since 1884. as director. 
Its originator and first director, Mr. Charles G. Leland, the well-known 
thinker and writer, prepared a statement of its theory which was pub- 
lished as a circular of information by the Bureau of Education; this
-P-A-G-E-1099
  
  EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1089 
was widely called for. Mr. Tadd observes that “the fact that we tried 
seventeen different methods of hand work proved the earnestness with 
which we struggled with the problem of hand training in the public 
schools.” “To be of the greatest service,” he observes, ‘“‘some system 
of manual training should be adopted which can be taught to that 
large number of pupils who leave school at or before 14 years of age. 
These boys and girls are the ones who require our most careful atten- 
tion. It is mainly this class that will be called upon to do the work 
that manual training schools prepare for. It is folly to say that chil- 
dren should not handle tools before they are 14 years of age. Knives, 
spoons, forks, scissors, pencils, pens, are tools which require delicate 
handling, yet children become: quite expert in their use at a very early 
age. Facility in the manipulation of musical instruments, such as vio- 
lins, pianos, flutes, etc., can be best attained while the pupil is young. 
The hands must grow accustomed to them. Is this not true of other 
means of expression which require similar skill, such as modeling, carv- 
ing, designing, engraving, and many other processes? Certainly our 
twelve years of experience indicate that such is the case, and that the 
true education of the senses can not be begun too early in life.” He 
adds ‘‘manual training includes all processes that train the muscles and 
mind to work in harmony. In some of its applications it gives skill in 
planing boards and shaping iron; but just as legitimately doesit make - 
the hand cunning to dissect a curve, to engrave an etching, or to finger 
a violin, What it must teach is this: Processes that will make the 
pupil muscularly as ready to begin any work when he is grown, as 
arithmetic and geography made him mentally ready. At the Indus- 
trial Art School they would find a dexterity taught, inculeating 
methods underlying success in any of 240 trades. Regard for the indi- 
viduality of the pupil is the thing to be constantly kept in view; to 
give additional power and facility to his hand, arm, eye, and brain. 
Give him the power to think and create anew; see that his eye is 
trained, his hand made dextrous, and his brain quickened, and you 
may trust him to learn with ease the art of handling machines or instru- 
ments of precision. He will handle and use them the better that his 
whole organization has been trained. Michael Angelo said, ‘Man must 
carry his measuring tools in his eye, not in his hand” While the 
hand, the brain, the eye are growing, is the time to give them the 
habits essential to their highest utility, such as dexterity, flexibility, 
skill, and powers of perception and conception.” He further says, 
“Many educators are willing to grant the intellectual advantages of 
our system of manual training, but are slow to perceive its moral 
results. To ‘fill the mind,’ to ‘enrich the understanding,’ is, in their 
view, the sole purpose of such education. This is the object, though 
not the sole one, of manual training by means of exact and definite 
study of concrete and abstract impressions of things, received physi- 
cally and mentally. Notice a child drawing the Anthemion with both

‘hands! Coordinations are being made, (1) physically, by means of 
visual, muscular, and tactual impressions in four different directions, 
up, down, to the right, and to the left; (2) intellectually, coordinations 
are being made in. balance, proportion, fitness, even distribution, sym- 
metry, tangential curves, growth, ete.; (3) morally, coordinations are 
being made in judgment, self-control, taste, grace, and beauty, and, as 
power develops, higher stages of these qualities come into play in the 
distinguishing of differences between goodness and badness, rectitude 
and integrity, and their opposites in nature.” He declares, “the four 
fundamental principles of our system of instruction are: 5 
“Wirst. Free-hand drawing in its simplest form. For instance, we 
draw a circle or leaf, one of the elementary forms in constant use, on 
- the blackboard. In making this circle the pupils are taught to swing 
their hands around without support, and to make a clean drawn cir- 
cular line. When any simple form can be made at a single stroke an 
important element of manual training has been gained. In this proc- 
ess both hands are employed, so as to give to each the same dexterity. 
“Second. These elementary forms are modeled in soft clay. 
“Third. The same forms are made in the opposite of soft clay, i. e., 
tough wood. 
“Fourth. These elementary processes are followed by. designing in 
those materials; creating forms on flat surfaces, in soft clay and in 
tough wood. By these four processes the pupils are taught to draw 
simple forms and all forms by aid of the hand and eye alone, and with- 
out recourse to rule and measure; to develop, diversify, and combine 
these so as to create original designs, and finally to. give their ideas 
permanent expression in clay or wood. Of the numerous trades now 
in existence there is not one that does not have one of these four prin- 
ciples as a fundamental element; and if the eye, the hand, and the 
judgment—all tools—are well trained, the instruments of-any trade 
ean be freely handled.” ’ 
The individuality alone of the child is called into play. There are 
no artificial aids to the result. No marks, no construction lines, no 
rulers, no calipers are employed; only the mind, the eye, and the hand. 
W.N. Hailman, Ph. D., superintendent of Indian schools, remarked: 
During the Exposition at Chicago one of my chief delights was the discovery of 
thisschool. It came to me as a reproach and a prophecy—a reproach for my despond- 
ency, a prophecy of a new eureka. Here there was not a stroke of work that did 
not embody a complete thought clearly elaborated in the learner’s mind. At every 
step I saw them intently, and yet without strain, gaining at the same time clearer 
comprehension of the object of their work and greater confidence in their powers of 
accurate, lucid self-expression.    
CARLISLE INDIAN SCHOOL. 
This school is supported by the United States Government, and is 
under the direction of Capt. R. H. Pratt, an officer of the United States 
Army specially detailed for this service. It takes its name from its 
location at Carlisle, Pa. Captain Pratt studied the negro as a soldier

and citizen, and the way in which he had progressed from barbarism by 
association with the whites, and became assured of his capability. In 
fighting Indians he had compared the Indian and negro, and said if 
the negroes were so changed by association the Indian can be; there- 
fore he concluded, if the Indian is treated as a man among men, if right 
methods are adopted, he can and will become civilized and Christianized, 
a promoter instead of a destroyer of human welfare. These views led 
him, when detailed in charge of captured savages sent from Fort Sill 
to Florida for a long term of confinement, to secure permission to 
instruct them in letters, industry, and conduct. This was granted, and 
as a result when the time was at hand to return them to their tribes 
some 22 young men asked to stay Hast and go to school three years, in 
order to learn to live more like white men. This was brought about by 
the aid of friends, and 17 of them went to Hampton Institute, 4 to 
Utica, and 1 to Tarrytown, N. Y. Later Captain Pratt brought 49 
others from different tribes to Hampton, and cooperated in securing 
their adaptation to the new conditions and to their becoming “inter- 
ested in education.” His observations led to reflections out of which 
sprang a separate school at Carlisle, Pa. General Hancock said, “I 
know of no better place for the establishment of such a school.” 
September 6, 1879, Captain Pratt was detailed to report to the Sec- 
retary of the Interior to work out his plans, and in October following 
he gathered 136 pupils from a half dozen Indian agencies, and the work . 
was begun among them which still continues to grow in efficiency. 
We quote from Captain Pratt’s report to the Commissioner of Indian 
Affairs, dated August 31, 1893: 
During these years 2,361 students were admitted to the school, of whom 1,483 
were boys and 378 girls. ‘These came from 59 different tribes. One thousand five 
hundred and ninety-seven have left the school, of whom only 60 graduated, all since 
1889, none having completed the course earlier; 131 died at the school, and 635 still 
remain at date of this report. 
During this period we have furnished to other schools more than 200 of our pupils 
as employees in the various capacities of teachers, assistant teachers, industrial 
teachers, mechanics, seamstresses, laundresses, cooks, and other assistants, and more 
than, 250 have been employed at the agencies as clerks, assistant clerks, farmers, 
assistant farmers, and in the various mechanical and other authorized Government. 
positions. About 80o0f our students have left their tribes, at least temporarily, to 
try their fortunes among the whites. 
The normal department, established four years ago, carries from 60 to 70 of the 
smartest pupils in two rooms, using from 8 to 10 of our most advanced pupils under 
the normal instructor as assistant teachers. These attend to their own studies in 
the higher departments one-half day, and teach the other half. This practice teach- 
ing has been of the greatest benefit to the pupil teachers, and is no detriment to tho 
younger pupils. 
Industrial features.—During the past year we haye continued to give practical 
instruction in mechanical and other industries. The system of one-half day work 
and one-half day school, established in the beginning, has continued to seem to us 
‘the best adapted for the double purpose of training in industries and at the same 
time giving a literary education. Through our shops we haye largely met the de- 
mands of the school in supplying our own wants, and have manufactured harness, 
wagons, and tinware in excess, for the agencies.
-P-A-G-E-1102
  1092 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
In the carpentering department the work has been generally repairs and improve- 
ments to buildings, making and mending of furniture, fences, ete. The blacksmith 
and wagon-making department has manufactured spring wagons and attended to 
the repair work of the school, including two farms, made bolts, hinges, staples, 
etc., and has shod our horses and mules. The shoemaking department has prac- 
tically made the shoes for our large number of students and attended to the 
repairing. The harness-making department has manufactured a large amount of 
harness for the agencies. A gentleman from Boston, who had worked twenty-two 
years at harness making, visited this department during the year, watched an 
Indian boy making one of the most troublesome pieces about harness, and pro- 
nounced him a wonder as a workman. The boy had worked at the trade four years 
and two months, half-day periods only. Nearly all the suits for 450 boys have been 
made in the tailoring department. The tinning and painting departments have 
done their part in the system. 
A number of our students have been efficient helpers in the care of our large 
steam plant where important changes have been made, and by their ability have 
saved us the employment of outside skilled labor. 
The farms have been carried on as heretofore, with a farmer in charge of each 
and a number of Indian boys to assist. The products of the farms have been below 
those of former years because of the very dry season. We made another trial of 
the ensilage system in feeding our stock, and with less waste than the previous 
year, but I am still not satisfied. The drought prevented the corn from maturing, 
and I regret to report the same occurs again this year. 
_ The dairy has been well conducted by one of our former students (a Cheyenne), 
and his ability in the management of our herd. is most gratifying. He obtained the 
knowledge which fitted him for this important place under our outing system. 
The bakery is also in charge of a former student who, with the assistance of 
Indian boys, has provided good bread for the students. 
The printing office, which has always been one of the most valuable departments 
of the school, calls for more special mention than I have heretofore at any time 
given to it. The work of this department comprises the publication of two papers: 
The Red Man, an eight page quarto, standard size, monthly, with a circulation of 
from 2,000 to 3,000, and The Indian Helper (103 by 15), weekly, circulation 9,000; 
also all the job work of the institution, consisting of numerous circulars, blank 
reports for the different departments, letter heads, envelopes, lists of pupils for use 
at the several quarters, constitution and by-laws for the societies and clubs, labels, 
pamphlets, official documents, blank receipts, booklets, and lesson leaves for the 
educational department, invitations, visiting and business cards, programmes, photo- 
graph cards, and numerous other jobs covering a valuation of hundreds of dollars if 
contracted for outside of the school. 
It is our aim to give to each apprentice a full course in composition, and as much 
of a course in the job, stone, and press work, as the facilities allow. 
We have had under instruction during the year 35 apprentices, with an average 
daily attendance of 16. 
The sewing department has made all the girls’ clothing and the boys’ underwear. 
The larger and more efficient girls have been specially trained in dressmaking. 
While a number of boys who have been trained in our industrial departments 
have'reached the grade of fair journeymen workers, and have gone out among the 
mechanics of this section and in other parts of the country, and worked success- 
fully in competition, earning their own living, it is a pleasure to note that girls 
trained in our sewing department have also, been enabled to take care of them-. 
selves after leaving the school through the knowledge gained in that department. 
Since the Government established Carlisle as an industrial school, the idea of 
industrial training in schools has made wonderful progress throughout the whole 
country, and a variety of manual, technical, and trade schools have been originated. 
A number of persons interested in establishing these schools have visited Carlisle 
 
-P-A-G-E-1103
  EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1093 
and studied our methods. I may mention particularly Mr. Auchmuty, of the cele-. 
brated Auchmuty Trade School of New York, who spent two days with me before 
he started his scheme, and closcly followed our system‘in his school. Mr. Pratt, of 
Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, sent his principal man here before establishing his school, 
and some of our features were adopted there. 
The outing system.—This is the placing of our students out among farmers and 
others during vacation that they may earn money for themselves, and learn prac- 
tically those lessons in civilized life that can be taught only imperfectly and theo- 
retically in any school. It also provides that a considerable number may enjoy the 
privileges of public and other schools and association with white children. During 
the year 621 pupils were thus out, of whom 376 were boys and 245 girls. We received 
requests for 692 boys and 591 girls, so that we were able to supply less than half as 
many as were asked for. Two hundred remained out in the public schools for the 
winter. 
There are two Sioux who were among the first pupils of Carlisle, one of whom 
remained four years, the other five years, They are indebted to this school for all 
the English and all the education and industrial training they had at the time of 
leaving it. They each spent over a year of their stay, under Carlisle’s care, in Mr. 
Wanamaker’s great store in Philadelphia, one in the accounts department and the 
other in the shipping department. One has been at home eight years, and the other 
nine. They have been continuously, as I have been constantly informed, rendering 
most valuable assistance in the school work on their reservations. The short period 
they each spent under the influence of the push of Mr. Wanamaker’s hive of indus- 
try did more to fit them for usefulness than ten years in the best Indian school that 
could be devised, equipping them not only for the work they have since been able to 
accomplish on the reservation, but rendering them perfectly competent to swing out 
from the reservation and hold their own among white men, which is after all to 
become the final lot of all Indians if the Government is ever to be freed from the 
care of them. 
Two former students of Carlisle who began life under the most veritable savage 
conditions, and came to Carlisle directly from those conditions, have been elected to, 
and are now filling, responsible county offices in the West called thereto by the votes 
of white men. Other examples by the score can be supplied. 
» The inquiry that should be made by all true friends of the Indian in regard to the 
results of Indian schools should not be that which is so universal, “What becomes 
of them after they go back; what do they do on the reservation ?” but should be, 
“What progress are Indian schools making toward rendering Indian youth capable 
of citizenship and independent of the tribe, reservation, and Government support ?” 
In‘answer to these last questions Carlisle is now and always has been ready with a 
full reply. s 
I state again, what I have so often stated before, that, thanks to the outing system 
and our facilities for applying it here, not more than one of our children in twenty 
who has passed three years or more under our care is unable to succeed in civilized 
pursuits among civilized people. Through their outing experiences their fears of 
the white man and of associating with him and of competing with him have been 
removed, and were it not for the. tremendous pressure manipulated to draw them 
back to the reservation, many times a larger proportion would pass out and assume 
place in our civilized communities. 
Savings system.—This system originated here and was established in the beginning 
of the school. It covers the wages earned in the industries of the school and the 
earnings of the pupils during their outings, and furnishes an opportunity to give all 
students instruction in economy and thrift and the keeping of accounts. All their 
earnings are deposited. An exact account is kept, and each depositor has a bank 
book, and is encouraged to put as much money as possible on interest. Under the 
regulations of the Department, apprentices work the first four months for nothing;
-P-A-G-E-1104
  1094 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
thereafter, for the first year they receive 4 cents for each half-day’s work; the second 
year, 6 cents; the third year and after, 12 cents. These small payments give them 
valuable encouragement. 
The earnings under the outing system are very much more material. All students 
are urged to save. Once a month they are given an opportunity to make purchases 
of necessary articles. These expenditures are made under the supervision of the 
officers of the school. That they may be made wisely, each scholar is furnished with 
an application blank on which to state how much money is wanted and for what pur- 
pose; likewise the amount in bank, which the student finds by balancing his account 
book. Book and application are then handed in for examination and approval and, 
if the balance be correct and the articles be approved, his paper is cashed and he 
makes the purchases, which are submitted to the inspection of the matron or disci- 
plinarian. 
They earned during the year $24,121.19, of which the boys earned $18,351.54 and 
the girls $5,769.65. Their savings at the end of June amounted to $15,274.99, of 
which $11,991.51 remained to the credit of the boys and $3,283.44 to the credit of 
the girls. About $7,000 of these amounts bears interest at 6 per centand 3 per cent. 
Nearly every student returning home at the close of the year had money thus 
earned. One party of 86 took over $1,300. Home-going students usually have a 
good trunk well filled, and some take sets of tools and other facilities to make 
earnings elsewhere. 
The exhibit of the school contained a wagon made for the United 
States Government; in carpentering, doors, shutters, desks, various 
ways of joining, cabinets, woodwork; in blacksmithing and work in 
metal, tools for work in iron and wood, horseshoes, ironwork for wagons, 
steam-pipe fittings; tinware, coffeepots, cups, buckets, and pans; in 
harness making, one single set, two double sets of harness; in shoe- 
making, men’s and women’s high and low shoes; in dressmaking, plain 
sewing, mending, darning, and knitting; several specimens of embroid- 
ery in silk, linen, and cotton; in china painting, several specimens; in 
graded common school work from the urst through the ninth grade in 
spelling, arithmetic, writing, drawing, language, geography, physiology, 
andhistory. Many photographs, charts, and publications added helpful 
information. 
But the most effective exhibit by the Carlisle Indian School was the 
visit of 500 of its pupils to the Fair in October. They came by special 
train. Captain Pratt secured special rates and they paid their expenses 
from their savings. The White City was a wonder world to them. A 
programme was offered for each day, but they were given entire free- 
dom either to accept it or to choose their own objects of interest. For 
four days the boys and girls saw the sights. Their yellow ribbon told 
everybody who they were. Their good dress, made of good material 
by their own hands, their orderly conduct and quiet, respectful man- 
ners and eager intelligent observation, won from the hundreds of thou- 
sands of visitors on the grounds during the days of their stay most 
hearty approval. It was an object lesson in Indian education. The 
contrast between them and the wild Indians showing themselves about 
the Fair was never beforeseen by so many. It left in the minds of the 
observer no doubt of the powerful beneficent effect of education. Their 
well-trained band was a special attraction.
-P-A-G-E-1105
EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1095 
What lessons they learned in patriotism and conduct, in history and 
the progress of arts and industries in the world! What lessons from 
the Fair will-they teach to others as long as they live! 
Pennsylvania took care to instruct those visiting its exhibit both in 
natural history and the history of its occupation by the white man. 
In the Mines Building, its rich mineral resources and the processes of 
their development could be studied; in the Forestry Building, its variety 
of trees; in the Anthropological Building, its birds and mammals—a 
rare collection. The scientific character and educational value of this 
collection is greatly enhanced by the attractive and realistic manner 
in which it is mounted. A miniature mountain and valley with rocks, 
trees, caves, and a stream of running water afford opportunities for 
mounting each specimen in some characteristic attitude or act, and the 
visitor feels that he is observing nature in reality. In the same build- 
ing were the very instructive exhibits of the bureau of charities and 
correction, a portion of which are elsewhere separately mentioned. 
The educational influence of the State exhibit of fine stock, farm 
products, methods and appliances of horticulture, machinery for the 
farm, the mine, and the manufactory can not fail to be the most helpful 
- among her own citizens, as well as information to the multitude of vis- 
itors from other quarters. 
In promoting the education of the historical sentiment the State was 
eminently successful. It furnished a large number of instructive 
articles to the colonial loan exhibit in the Government Building. 
Elsewhere relies were gathered, too numerous to mention. A model 
recalled the building in which Congress met in its retreat at York; the 
State Building by architecture, sculpture, and painting repeated some- 
thing of history at every turn, while to the whole was fitly added the 
veritable Liberty Bell, cast in 1752, or twenty-four years before the 
Declaration of Independence was made, and bearing the inscription, 
“By order of the Province of Pennsylvania, in the statehouse of the 
city of Philadelphia, 1752. Proclaim liberty throughout all the land 
to all the inhabitants thereof.” 
MARYLAND. 
The exhibit of Maryland education, which came as a unit before the 
board of judges, was separate in its installation. The visitor, as he 
approached the Johns Hopkins University alcove and surveyed its 
abundant evidences of scientific instruction and scientific research on 
a seale so large and in directions so numerous, was not prepared to 
learn the limited number of years it has been in existence. Fortu- 
nately, at the start the funds were large and the management had the 
wisdom and good fortune to secure the services of Daniel C. Gilman as 
president. Under his guidance came at once full form into the edu- 
cational world—a university indeed. The evidences of this were so 
arranged in the exhibition as to be readily studied and to leave no 
 
-P-A-G-E-1106
  1096 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
doubt of the comprehensiveness of the theory of its administration and 
of the effectual execution of that theory in practice. The country stood 
in great need of the opportunities it offered after the work of the 
American college is completed. Fortunately, it has furnished many 
American students what they otherwise would have gone to Europe to 
obtain. Wisely, the university has emphasized publication; this was 
well illustrated at the exhibition. The collection from the university 
was an illustration of the educational possibilities of the State in 
which its people may well take the profoundest interest. There is 
oceasion for special remark in the extent to which the university has 
come to meet the demand of the country as indicated by the number 
of important historical and scientific associations which center around 
its officers. The public school system and the State normal school are 
still moving forward on the plans and under the inspiration given them 
by the Hon. M. A. Newell, LL.D., for twenty years their able, schol- 
arly, and efficient superintendent. As would be expected, the schools 
at Baltimore, under Supt. Henry A. Wise, lead the State. The hand 
work from both the white and colored manual training schools received 
awards. The judges also gave awards to the primary grammar and 
high schools and City College of Baltimore, and the office of the . 
State superintendent. Among the other institutions recognized by 
the judges were the Bryn Mawr school, the English-German school, 
the Woman’s College, and the Girls’ Latin school. In the State the 
number of Catholic schools which received awards was large. Among 
them, some of the most important were Rock Hill College and the 
Ammondale Normal School. 
. There was no exhibit from the Pratt Library or the Peabody Insti- 
tution, having great educational influence in the city of Baltimore. 
OHIO. 
The legislators of this great State have never adequately taken hold 
of an exhibit from its schools. The credit won for its education is due 
to its educators. They led the way, did the work, and provided for 
its expenses. Since the passage of the Akron school law, so called, by 
which a small board of education was authorized to manage the schools 
of that city, Ohio has been much commended for its union or graded 
schools; but its country schools have not secured the legislation need- 
ful for their greatest efficiency. There should be legal assurance for 
better qualified teachers and. better local supervision. Some of the 
country districts exerted themselves under the inspiration of Commis- 
sioner O. T. Corson, and by the dint of great effort of teachers and local 
officers and friends made important exhibits of great interest. Among 
those which deserved and received consideration from the board of 
judges were schools in the counties of Darke, Auglaize, Butler, Knox, 
Geauga, Hamilton, Stark, Tuscarawas, Ashland, and Clark. Some of 
the student work showed excellent methods and fidelity on the part of 
 
-P-A-G-E-1107
  EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1097 
teachers and pupils. There were specimens, too, of marked merit in 
the several subjects of instruction from towns like Gallion, Piqua, Nor- 
walk, Sandusky, Middleton, Mansfield, Lancaster, and Hamilton. But 
the great strength of the public school exhibit was from the three cities, 
Columbus, Cleveland, and Cincinnati. These collections recalled not 
only the care and skill of those at present in charge, but the self-sacri- 
ficing labors of Lord, Stevenson, Hancock, Peaslee, Freese, Rickoff, and 
White. Some of the work.in these cities it would be difficult to excel. 
It showed the mastery of the best principles and methods. What a 
triumph if all had come up to the standard o7 the best! AIl grades of 
work in these cities were heartily commended. A more general appli- 
cation of sound pedagogical principles would soon be apparent in results 
if the State would do its duty in providing normal training for. its 
teachers. Ohio made little special effort to show the progress of manual 
training. “What there was exhibited was of good quality. The exhibit 
from the manual training school of Toledo gave great satisfaction. This 
school is a part of the public school system and is located in a wing of 
the high school building. Manual training is formally assigned its 
place in the course of study. It conflicts with nothing and is fairly 
treated. Its exhibit was well installed and much of the time well 
explained. It afforded an opportunity to get a fair comparative esti- 
mate of the pedagogical value of this department of training, and made 
a-strong argument in favor of its having a place in the public school 
system. 
The technical school at Cincinnati is working on philosophical lines 
and if amply supported has an important future. 
The exhibit of Wesleyan University called attention to this important 
Methodist institution and its great promise for the future. Oberlin 
College exhibit, composed of catalogues, photographs, students’ work, 
and maps showing the location of its graduates in different parts of 
the world, called up its interesting history, the struggle of its worthy 
founders, the great work they did for Christian education, and pointed 
to the deserved recognition it has at last received in promoting the 
progress of the world. Oberlin led the way in admitting women to the 
same college instruction as men. Wilberforce University, founded and 
conducted by colored men for colored people, is aided by the State, but 
not under State direction. Its exhibition told the story of the trying 
conditions under which the institution arose in a State where slavery 
never existed, and illustrated the usefulness it has at last achieved for 
the colored people. 
The illustrations in mathematics were a specially attractive feature 
in the exhibit in the institution for normal instruction at Ada. 
The Catholic schools of the State gave a hearty response to the call 
of their church authorities and gained a number of awards.
-P-A-G-E-1108
1098 EDUCATION: REPORT, 1892-93. 
INDIANA. 
The school exhibit of Indiana, under the supervision of Hon. W. N. 
Hailmann, showed a clear pedagogical conception of the system which 
the State has for a number of years been working out with intelligence. 
The publications of the students, the opportunity to know the school 
laws of the State, the growth of the system of education, the relation of 
district and high and normal schools to the State University and to 
Purdue University, which takes the place of a college of agriculture 
and mechanic arts, and the gradations from the kindergarten to the 
college or university, were readily understood. The plan, arrangement, 
and devices were excellent. It gave the impression that one had before 
him, in a fair measure of completeness, the characteristics of the coun- 
try, village, and city schools of the State; it showed a State system 
the different parts of which came together in a way to give strength to 
each and to the whole. 
The State superintendent, or chief executive officer of the system, is 
elected by the people every two years. Fortunately, he is sometimes 
reelected. He has general supervision of the administration of the sys. 
tem, its funds and revenues, the interpretation of the school law, and, 
the reports to the governor and assembly of the State, and for this pur- 
pose compiles the statistics, visits schools, apportions revenues, and. 
distributes the school. laws. 
The State board of education is composed of the governor, State 
superintendent, president of the State University, president of Purdue 
University, president of the State normal school, and the school super- 
intendents of the three principal cities, Indianapolis, Evansville, and 
Terre Haute. It regulates the examinations for the State certificates 
and licenses, and attends to such other matters as may be assigned to 
it; and it supervises the adoption of the text-books. . 
The State is divided into counties, the counties into townships, or 
towns and cities. 
Each county has a superintendent elected by the township trustees 
every two years. Fortunately, a considerable number are reelected, and 
some are continued in office a fair number of years, thus saving much 
friction and loss. The duties of the county superintendent are examin- 
ing and securing teachers, holding county institutes, compiling school 
statistics, reporting to the State superintendent, and carrying out the 
directions given by him and the State board. 
In the townships the people elect the school trustees every four 
-years; in the town, the town board or city council appoint three trustees 
for three years. Their duties are the management of school property, 
levying local school taxes, the employment of teachers, holding town- 
ship institutes, and reporting to county superintendent and commis- 
sioners.
-P-A-G-E-1109
  EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1099 
School directors are elected by the patrons of each district for one 
year. Directors preside at school meetings, mediate between the peo- 
ple and trustees, care for the eo provide fuel, and may exclude 
refractory pupils. 
The growth of the educational interest was at first slow, but it finally 
developed into an effective system. The first constitution of the State 
required the general assembly to enact an- efficient and general school 
law. The State had the benefit of the national educational grant of 
land. Ineffectual efforts were-made to carry out its requirements. 
There was no supervision, State or county; administration was to be 
dependent upon the votes of the school district. The revised constitu- 
tion required the establishment of a system equally open to all of 
school age, and required the election of a State superintendent to direct 
the organization and administration of the system. 
The required law was enacted in 1852; this act contains the germs 
of the present system. After several peices a comprehensive act 
was passed in 1865, and, with amendments, constitutes the law of to-day. 
There are two permanent school funds—the common school fund and 
the Congressional township fund. They may be increased, but they 
never can be diminished. Both school funds amount to $7,454,632.41, 
and are derived (1) from the surplus revenue received from the United 
States in 1836, amounting to $537,502.96; (2) from the bank-tax fund, 
amounting to $80,000, that came from a tax on banks by the act of 
1845; (3) from the saline fund, amounting to $85,000, and arising from 
the sale of lands around salt springs; (4) from the sinking fund created 
in 1834, and amounting to $3,904,783.22; (5) from the seminary fund, 
derived from the sale of county seminaries by the act of 1852, and 
amounting to $100,000. The Congressional township fund arises from 
the sale of the sixteenth section, given to each township, in accordance 
with the ordinance of 1787 and under the act of 1816, amounting to 
$2,522,223.18. 
The generations to come can not too carefully keep in mind the con- 
fluence of influence which affords them the advantages of free educa- 
tion. There is also a contingent fund derived from fines and escheats, 
estrays, road sales, delinquent taxes, and sale of swamp lands granted 
by Congress in 1850, amounting to $2,263,936.24. These sources of reve- 
nue, together with the income from the State school fund, yielded for 
the year $7,845,674. By the reports it appears that nncunate over 
this sum was Senibd or a total of $8,367,619. 
Common schools.—In townships these canes ungraded and graded 
elementary district schools and township high schools; in towns and 
cities kindergarten (children from 4 to 6), graded elementary schools, 
high schools, night schools (in cities of 3,000 or more inhabitants for 
persons fom: 14 to 30 years old), and manual training schools (in cities 
of 100,000 or more inhabitants—Indianapolis). , |  
-P-A-G-E-1110
1100 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
A course of study has been outlined by a committee of experienced 
educators and offered to the schools of the State as an aid to classifica- 
tion. In the course for the district school, the first, second, and third 
year grades of the course require each a year; the fourth grade, two 
years; the fifth grade, three years. High schools are known as “com- 
inissioned,” those’ whose certificate admits to the university, and 
“noncommissioned,” those from which pupils are not admitted to the 
university on the certificate of having taken their course. Commis- 
sioned high schools have a minimum course of three years, or twenty- 
seven months, and a longer course of four years, or thirty-six months. 
The exhibit was arranged to allow the study of the results of these 
courses. 
The kindergarten work from Indianapolis and Laporte deserved the 
hearty commendation it received, especially that from the normal classes. 
These kindergartens furnish good examples for study. They are formed 
in a thorough understanding of both the principles and the methods of 
Froebel. The accuracy with which each gift was prepared in the 
Laporte collection, and the harmony of the whole, were to be expected. 
from the training by Mrs. Hailmann. 
The free kindergarten movement in Indianapolis is one of special 
mark. It is under the direction of an organization of ladies. The first 
president, Mrs. Peelle, wife of Hon. Stanton J. Peelle, once a member 
of Congress and now one of the judges of the United States Court of 
Claims, as a pioneer president, sacrificed her health in making the 
movement a success. Mrs. Eliza G. Wiley is now president. The 
association reports an attendance of 4,182 in all departments of its 
work. In addition to the kindergarten proper, it has a training school 
for kindergarten teachers; also a domestic training school in which 
kitchen garden is taught, and a variety of sloyd for boys and girls. 
Mothers’ meetings are held and literary clubs encouraged. 
The training school for kindergarten teachers, under Mrs. Eudora L. 
Hailmann, Laporte, occupies a building adjoining the residence. The 
principal lives with the students from three to four hours daily, work- 
ing, playing, thinking, and discussing with them. The course of study 
is thorough and much educational literature is mastered. The aim 
of the school is to develop in the student full, rich womanhood as the 
indispensable condition of truly helpful guidance in the educational. 
life of the home, kindergarten, and school. 
The collections from all grades of the schools of Laporte and Indian- 
apolis add to the high quality of the Indiana exhibit. In each collec- 
tion the results of central working ideas are apparent. From Laporte 
one sees the fruit of the kindergarten in the higher grades; sentiment, 
so prominent in the German schools, manifests its presence—the senti- 
ment which exalts the home and the patriotism which cherishes the 
institutions of freedom. The study of form, too, is prominent. In the 
Indianapolis collection there are many indications of the wise use made  
-P-A-G-E-1111
  EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1101 
of the study of nature. One sees that attention is given to the cultiva- 
tion of both the retlective and the expressive faculties in reasonable 
proportion. The regard for principles and methods is characterized 
by marked freedom of choice. The work in manual training deserves 
special mention. 
It was refreshing to come upon the work of district country schools 
in the county exhibits. These country schools, which furnish all the 
school training for so large a majority of the children of the land, on 
account of many hindrances, make small showing of their vast work. 
In Indiana they feel the power of the State system, and it was easier 
to bring into exhibition something of their work. The signs of the influ- 
ence of the course of study provided by the State could be discovered 
here and there. 
The specimens from Miss Della Brown’s school in Marion County 
caught the eye of many an approving teacher. 
Charts of the young people’s reading circles and of the teachers’ 
reading circles pointed to a most excellent influence of these organiza- 
tions upon the reading of the young and of the teachers of the State. 
The authorities of Purdue University, Hon. James H. Smart, LL. D., 
president, appreciated their opportunity and improved it. The exhibit 
was large, showing the several departments to advantage. Prof. W. 
W. Folwell fitly commended it, first, for excellence as a general poly- 
technic school, subdivided into departments, each well provided for 
in buildings, laboratories, apparatus, and other appliances of instruc- 
tion, as shown by means of photographs, drawings, and blue prints, 
and by skillfully arranged charts; second, for the work of students, as 
shown by specimens of drawings and prints, sketches and illustra- 
tions, fine machine tools designed and made by students, wood cary- 
ing, patterns, metal work, notebooks, and theses, all of high merit; 
third, for the idea and plan of the display itself—to exhibit the courses 
of study, the progressive steps of instruction, and the graded processes 
of work by means of a limited number of specimens suitably arranged, 
no effort being made to impose by mere mass of material; fourth, for 
the union of science and practice in the work of the institution. 
The State schools for the blind, deaf, and feeble-minded—these spe- 
cially interesting classes—all exhibit work of great merit, and have 
won favorable opinions for the provision made for their institution by 
the State. The emphasis placed upon training in useful industries and 
in conduct deserves hearty commendation. 
The Girls’ Classical School of Indianapolis made an exhibit that dis- 
closed excellent system and training. « 
As was frequently observed, the student of this State educational 
exhibit, as step by step he discovered its merits, was not surprised that 
the educators of the State set out with a purpose to render Indiana’s 
educational exhibit “the initial act of a new educational era in the 
school history of the State.”

  1102 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Catholic schools.—The Catholic schools in the State joined the other 
* Catholic schools in their exhibit. There was a good evenness of merit 
in the elementary work. In addition to the usual branches, such as 
spelling, writing, drawing, reading, geography, grammar, physiology, 
history, and arithmetic, there was evidence of much attention to 
Christian Bible history, and to bookkeeping, business forms, type- 
writing, stenography, music, painting, needlework, and embroidery. 
Great care in preparation was manifest. The work of the higher 
grades bore the same marks of careful preparation in advanced mathe- 
matics, French, German, chemistry, physics, rhetoric, logic, the classics, 
and commercial law and literature. The diocese of Fort Wayne rep- 
resented seventy schools. The exhibit of the Sisters of Providence 
from St. Mary’s Institute, St. Marys, Vigo County, commanded special 
attention. It was not only large in amount and varied in character, 
but of superior quality. But the most imposing of the Catholic 
exhibits of the State was, as might be expected, under the auspices of 
the Congregation of the Holy Cross from the University of Notre 
Dame, Notre Dame. The students’ work in letters and in manual 
training was effectively shown. There were twenty-six volumes of 
Notre Dame scholastics containing students’ work in English composi- 
tion, rhetoric, and belles-lettres, crayons and casts from life, applica- 
tion of drawing in wood and metal, specimens of books printed and 
published, painting and lithographs illustrating the growth of the 
university. Photography was used with special effect in setting forth 
bacteriology, microscopy, electrical engineering, the art schools, libra- 
ries, cabinets, lecture rooms, laboratories, department of natural his- 
tory, school of law and music, the gymnasium, preparatory school of 
manual training, normal school, colleges, halls, and associations, social, 
athletic, and literary. 
But the study of the historical collection was specially rewarded. 
It would require an extended catalogue to. mention the articles exhib- 
ited connected with the history of the church, its marked events, its 
eminent officers, teachers, priests, bishops and archbishops, cardinals 
and popes. 
ILLINOIS. 
The State of Illinois, in recognition of the fact that the great Exhi- 
bition was on its soil and within the limits of its great metropolitan 
city, made a special exhibition of its own, erecting a building for the 
purpose, where the educational work was installed. This was a valu- 
able exhibit in itself, including the common schools and the higher insti- 
tutions of the State. Chicago enjoyed peculiar advantages. Visitors 
could not only study the plan of the city system and its work in the 
exhibition, but they could easily, from its intelligent and courteous 
officers, see the actual work in operation, the teachers, the pupils, 
buildings, grounds, all the conditions which make up the public school 
training of the children of the city of a million and half of people.

EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1103 
CITY OF CHICAGO. 
Hon. A. J. Lane, city superintendent of public instruction, under the 
Columbia educational exhibit gives an outline of the effort made to 
secure to the schools the greatest advantage from the possible influ- 
ences to be exerted by the exhibition. It may be quoted as giving not 
only what was undertaken in Chicago, but as illustrating the plans 
undertaken elsewhere for a similar purpose. Of course, elsewhere 
there was no such proximity to the exhibition. He says: 
COLUMBIAN EDUCATIONAL EXHIBIT, 
The year has been eventful to the children of Chicago, because they have been so 
fully acquainted with all the preparatory steps which have been taken to secure 
and inaugurate the greatest exposition of the arts and sciences, commerce and 
agriculture, and all the wonderful achievements of men which the world has ever 
witnessed, 3 
At the beginning of the school year the board of education purchased for each 
school a set of readers entitled The Story of Columbus. 
The children reviewed the history of Columbus and the discovery of America, 
prior to the public celebration of ‘Columbus Day” on October 21, 1892. A uniform 
programme of exercises, such as was used in all the schools of the United States, 
was followed in the Chicago schools, as follows:

This programme was extended, however, in many of the schools and embraced 
historical essays, patriotic songs, and short addresses from citizens. 
The dedication of the building at Jackson Park afforded an opportunity for the 
school to fully study the aims and purposes of the Exposition. A map of the 
grounds, showing the landscape gardening, and the location, size, and general 
appearance of the buildings, was used. The location and character of the exhibits 
placed in the different buildings were quite generally studied. During May and 
June many of the pupils visited the Exposition and reported the results of their
-P-A-G-E-1114

observations. Quite generally the teachers used the exhibits to illustrate geography 
and history, and selected special reading to bring them into use, to make real the 
things which had been formerly known only by written descriptions. The teachers 
appreciated the fact that this was the opportunity of a lifetime for the pupils to 
study the products, manufactures, and inventions, the habits and characteristics of 
the nations of the earth. 
At the beginning of the school year the principals were requested to preserve 
papers from the daily work of the pupils, which should be used in making a local 
exhibit in each school of what was done in the different grades. Cards for mount- 
ing the written paper and drawings were furnished. At the close of the school year, 
in June, exhibits were made in every school in Chicago and the parents were invited 
to come and inspect them. 
The assistant superintendents were requested to select from the work of the dif- 
ferent schools papers, maps, sketches, etc., which would most fairly represent in the 
Columbian Exposition the educational work of the Chicago schools: 
The best representative work in the different subjects in each grade was selected 
and bound into volumes. These included papers on the different topics in each 
branch of study, arranged in the order given in the course of study and showing the 
process and methods used in developing them. 
Volumes for each grade were prepared giving the work of whole classes. These 
included the principal’s examinations for promotions in the grade work, the teach- 
er’s written reviews, class exercises in physiology, familiar science lessons, historical 
sketches, geographical descriptions, ete. 
Single papers representing the most suggestive plan in the development of each 
subject of every grade were selected and mounted upon cards. Some were framed 
with glass fora wall exhibit, and others were placed in cabinets, each holding 33 
cards or 132 papers. 
In addition to the written work, the exhibits embraced drawings from every grade; 
pen and ink sketches illustrating historical events and science lessons; maps 
showing relief of countries, territorial growth, political divisions, distribution of 
products and other facts, in geography and history; illustrated work in the varied 
topics of arithmetic and forms of bookkeeping; paper folding in the primary 
grades; designing in colored papers showing harmony in colors and beauty in form; 
pencil, crayon, and water-color sketches of objects which were studied in science 
lessons; specimens of clay modeling of typical forms, a sphere, cylinder, square, 
pyramid, ovoid, etc. ; fruits and leaves with other natural objects nearest these type 
forms; specimens of sewing as it was taught from the second to the fifth grades; 
and woodwork showing the various objects constructed and the principles applied 
in manual training in the primary and grammar grades. 
The kindergartens presented a limited exhibit showing the different forms of con- 
struction work which children under 6 years of age are taught to do. 
The high schools presented full exhibits of their work in free-hand, mechanical, 
and architectural drawing. There were sketches from casts, and water-color pic- 
tures of natural objects studied in science lessons, including microscopic drawings. 
There were papers and sketches showing the progressive steps in biology, that is, 
zoology and botany, or first-year science; in physics and chemistry, with illustrated 
drawings showing experiments; also in history and literature. One volume of essays 
was furnished from each high school. One biological table, with a case having an 
outfit of instruments used in science teaching in high schools, was exhibited, show- 
ing the provision made by the board of education for the department of science. 
Bookcases were also placed in the exhibit, with copies of all the text-books and 
supplemental reading books furnished by the board. Many papers, drawings, and 
constructed charts were arranged for the wall exhibit. 
The English high and manual-training school presented a complete exhibit of the 
constructive work in wood andiron; sketches showing every step in mechanical and 
architectural drawing; in all, a very large and comprehensive exhibit of their work. 
 
-P-A-G-E-1115
    
  EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1105 
The evening schools were represented by a case containing thirty-three sketches 
of house plans and elevations, mechanicai drawings, and geometric projections. 
The whole exhibit was very complete and was a creditable presentation of the 
work done in the various departments of the school system of Chicago. The 
products are only the outward symbols of the real work which is dene. The train- 
ing of the mind, the unfolding of mental power, the development of right character, 
are the real work of the.schools. These results are exhibited in the lives and charac- 
ters of the millions of American’citizens who not only produced the great Colum- 
bian Exposition but will visit it and assemble in the great congresses to discuss 
the problems of human progress. 
Other cities more nearly equal in size vied with each other in pre- 
sentation of school work. The collection from rural schools was spe- 
cially commended. The collections from this State alone would make 
a valuable exhibit. Kindergarten principles were extensively illus- 
trated. In portions of the State manual training is winning its way, 
and will become more and more a part of the public school system. 
THE STATE NORMAL INSTRUCTION. 
Two State institutions are doing a most important work for the 
advancement of the qualifications of the teachers, and thus for the 
benefit of the children of the State. The Southern Normal, founded 
the later of the two, is following closely after the. Normal University 
at Normal. This was the first institution under the auspices of the 
State to give an uplift to the intelligence of its people. Gen. Charles 
E. Hovey, a graduate of Dartmouth College, who brought to the State 
experiences from Hastern schools, and was a teacher at Peoria before 
the State system had taken shape, was organizer and superintendent 
of public schools there. As editor of the Journal of Education and an 
officer of the State Educational Association he led in the formative 
measures adopted, especially in determining the action in the steps 
taken which led to the establishment of the university, became its first 
president, and stamped his impress on it for all time. It has done a 
high grade of pedagogical work, and its students are performing 
important services in Illinois and elsewhere throughout the country. 
Its present president, John W. Cook, has won a high position among 
the educators of the country, as did his predecessor, Dr. Hewitt. 
The Public School Journal, published at Bloomington and edited by 
George P. Brown and E. S. Hewitt, received the following award: 
For excellence: First, as a practical, progressive, stimulating educational journal, 
critical, but appreciative of serious effort toward improvement in every department 
of educational work; second, for its high standard of administration, supervision, 
and methods of teaching; third, for its philosophical treatment of all subjects, and 
for its sound pedagogical principle; fourth, for its literary work. 
This State exhibit did not come under the consideration of the judges 
until late, but received numerous awards. 
The exhibition of the university was a study in itself. To one observ- 
ant of its origin and growth it was full of deep significance. The 
ED 93——70
-P-A-G-E-1116

pictures of its two presidents indicated that it was of recent founda- 
tion. Unfortunately for Illinois, there sprang up no great State uni- 
versity from the National Government grant for that purpose, as in 
Michigan, but the State was not without those thoughtful, forecasting 
citizens who sought such a boon for their Commonwealth. The so-called 
national agricultural college land grant furnished them the means and 
opportunity for the realization of their desires. Lllinois received by 
this grant scrip for 480,000 acres. Fortunately, John M. Gregory, 
LL. D., who had been president of the college at Kalamazoo, Mich., and 
superintendent of schools in that State, was called to be the first pres- 
ident or regent, a man eminently fitted for the untried responsibility, 
' both by nature and attainment. The institution was located May 8, 
1867, in Champaign County. Work began March 2, 1868, when there 
were present, besides the regent, 3 professors and some 50 students, 
mostly from the vicinity. During the first term another instructor was 
added, and there wasa total enrollment of 77 students, all young men. 
The attendance was small, but the plans were large. In the courses of 
study adopted May 8, 1867, six general departments were outlined, and 
under these were named fifteen courses of study. The extent to which 
the industries, as distinguished from the professions, were considered 
indicated a substantially new departure in State university work. The 
spirit of its founders is well indicated in the following words: 
Let the State open wide, then, this Pierian fount of learning. Let her bid freely 
all her sons to the full and unfailing flow; those whose thirst and needs are little, 
to what they require; those whose thirst and capacities are larye, to drink their fill. 
Let the university be worthy of the great State whose name it bears, worthy the 
grand and splendid industries it seeks to promote, and worthy of the great century 
in which we live. : 
In 1870 shop instruction was commenced; in the same year women 
were admitted. Since then they have constituted one-sixth to one-fifth 
* of the total number of students. In 1875 the university led off for the 
country with a course in domestic science, in charge of Miss Allen, 
afterwards Mrs. Dr. J. M. Gregory. The pictures of grounds, buildings, 
and appliances, the work of students in the various departments of 
instruction and practice, and the literature freely furnished gave evi- 
dence of the great progress of the institution in fulfilling the purpose 
of its founders. The picture of the second president, Dr. Peabody, 
recalls the fidelity and ability with which he sought to promote the 
progress of the university. During his presidency he had won national 
recognition, and from which he came to superintend the important 
department of liberal arts in the great Exhibition. The total attend- 
ance in 1892-93 was 714, or 104 women and 610 men. 
COOK COUNTY NORMAL SCHOOL, 
This school, under Col. Francis W. Parker, has done most important 
work. Its exhibit, located in the assembly hall of the Children’s Build- 
ing, was much studied and received most hearty commendation from 
the best informed educators.

EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1107 
First. This is a purely professional school for the training of teachers. 
No one is admitted into the school unless they have had a four years’ 
course in a high school or college. Connected with the normal depart- 
ment there is a practice school and kindergarten consisting of some 
_ 500 pupils. 
Second. The pedagogical doctrine applied by the school is known 
under the name of “Concentration,” or “The unification of studies.” 
The education exhibit is the outcome of the application of this doctrine. 
Third. The exhibit consisted of— 
(1) One hundred volumes of bound work: (a) Work of the profes- 
sional training class, consisting of plans for teaching, including draw- 
ings, paintings, and all the items of which a series of lessons consist; 
(b) about fifty volumes of books consisting of the work of pupils in the 
practice school from the first to the eighth grades, inclusive, showing 
the relation of science to art and to penmanship. 
(2) The art work upon the walls consisted of paintings and drawings 
which sprang immediately from the science or history work. The - 
theory of this method is that the art expression of the thought enhances 
intrinsic thought itself. These paintings and drawings were illustra- 
tions of science and history work, both from the practice school and 
the training class. About a hundred single unbound books were pre- 
sented, being the work of individual pupils in the different subjects of 
science, history, and arithmetic. These books were written and the art 
illustrations appended to illustrate the written work. 
(3) In geography two large relief maps of North America and South 
America, 42 by 62 inches, were shown. Also, maps drawn by a new 
method of map drawing, called chalk modeling. This method shows 
by one stroke of the crayon the vertical and horizontal forms of land 
surface. The principal charts were orographical maps of Greece, Spain, 
India, the Nile Basin, ete. 
(4) The pasteboard and wood sloyd work of the school was shown 
as a feature in the school work. Also, a large amount of apparatus 
' made by the children to illustrate elementary physics and chemistry. 
The particular features of the work may be summed up as the appli- 
cation of the theory of concentration or the unification of studies, and 
the introduction of the conceptive modes of expression making, model- 
ing, painting, and drawing. The honesty of the work was apparent. 
It was not touched by the teacher or worked over by the child. 
EDUCATION OF WOMEN AS DOCTORS AND NURSES. 
The education of women as doctors and nurses in Illinois afforded 
the opportunity for an interesting study of their work in the hospital, 
or the Illinois hospital, or the emergency hospital, as it was variously 
ealled. Those whose sufferings on the ground were relieved in it may 
well tell of it only as a hospital; here it is considered in its relation to 
education of women. Its plan embraced under one roof “a model 
 
-P-A-G-E-1118
  1108 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
operating room with all appliances; a model diet kitchen fully equipped 
for hospital necessities; a model office and reception room; a section of 
a child’s ward; a section of a woman’s ward; and a private room for 
patients; in the latter every comfort and convenience and the best of 
care for any woman or child who may desire to apply for medical serv- 
ices, or who may be brought to the hospital. All three schools of 
medicine were represented in the attending physicians; a resident 
physician of each school being appointed for daily service. Volunteer 
physicians from each school of medicine were in attendance for varying 
periods during the continuance of the Fair. A head nurse was con- 
stantly in the building, and every training school in the State was to 
be represented some time during the six months, through one or more 
of its graduates, who served likewise for varying periods as cireum- 
stances might require. 
Before passing, it should be noted that during the Fair 2,290 patients 
received treatment, while neither the number of visitors to ‘the show” 
portion of the building nor the inquiries answered can be estimated. 
Here one learned that the movement in Illinois for the education of 
women as physicians began in 1870, in the Women’s Hospital Medical 
College of Chicago, afterwards known as the Woman’s Medical College 
of Chicago, and in 1892 secured universal recognition, and is now The 
Northwestern University Woman’s Medical School, and past as well as 
future graduates of the school are made alumne of the university. In 
this connection it is interesting to recall that— 
In 1859 two women educated as physicians came to Chicago, and in spite of oppo- 
sition and discouragements succeeded in establishing themselves in the practice of 
medicine. One by one others followed, until now about 310 are practicing medicine 
in Illinois, and the number is increasing. About 145 belong to the regular school of 
medicine, 130 to the homeopathic, and 35 to the eclectic. Nearly 210 are located 
within the present boundaries of Chicago, the remainder are scattered through the 
towns of the State. Reliable reports indicate that a large percentage are successful. 
The majority are in general practice, while a few are specialists, and many are doing 
surgical work to a greater or less extent. Almost all operations for the diseases of 
women are being performed by them, as well as many general surgical operations. 
The Illinois Training School for Nurses, founded in 1880, did pioneer 
work, and was considered at the start as “preposterous” by some and 
“superfluous” by others. 
One hundred and thirty nurses are now in the school, with a superin- 
tendent, two assistant superintendents, besides a matron and assistant 
matron at the Nurses’ Home, No. 304 Honoré street. The home was 
built by the association with subscriptions from the friends of the insti- 
tution and a legacy from Miss Phebe Smith, of Chicago. 
Through a bequest from John Crerar, the directors of the school have 
been enabled to establish a system of nursing at low rates for people 
of moderate means, the price being graduated from $3 to 810a week, 
according to the income of the family. All money received for nursing
-P-A-G-E-1119

is added to the income of the fund, in order to supply.as many families 
as possible. ; f 
Of the 337 graduates, 23 hold responsible positions, some as superin- 
tendents, some as matrons, others as head nurses in institutions and 
hospitals in Chicago and elsewhere; some are employed as Orerar 
nurses, a few have become physicians, but most of them are private 
nurses in Chicago and other cities. 
In 1885 there followed the organization of the school for nurses con- 
nected with the Women and Children’s Hospital, also that connected 
with St. Luke’s Hospital, and in 1876 the Bethesda School; in 1888, the 
Rockford School; in 1889, the Lincoln Park School; in 1890, the Michael 
Reese Hospital School. The training school for city, home, and foreign 
missions is located at 114 Dearborn avenue. The Visiting Nurses’ 
Association of Chicago, reorganized through the efforts of the Ethical 
Society in 1885, and again through the aid given by Miss Shumway in 
1887 as a memorial to her mother, has already been generally recog- 
nized as an effective agency; indeed, its nurses in a single year have 
extended their care to 2,478 patients. 
The number of Catholic schools of all grades in the State which par- 
ticipated in their exhibit was very large, and their merit was such as 
to secure many awards. 
MICHIGAN. 
If the educational exhibit of Michigan did not receive so many 
awards as those of other States of approximately the same size in 
respect to educational work it presented numerous points of special 
study. The student speedily found his interest concentrated on a few 
leading lines; first, the public school work; second, that of the normal 
schools; third, that of the college of agriculture; and fourth, and by 
no means least, that of the State University at Ann Arbor. 
In Michigan what is known as the “State University ” has reached its 
highest development in America. 
Hon. Henry R. Pattengill, superintendent of public instruction, 
briefly summarizes the public school system of Michigan as follows: 
First, the common schools. 
Second, the high schools. 
Third, the university, founded in 1837: Department of literature, science, and the 
arts; department of medicineand surgery; departmentof law; school of pharmacy ; 
homeopathic medical college; college of dental surgery. 
Fourth, the State normal school, Ypsilanti, 1852. 
Fifth, the State Agricultural College, Lansing, 1855, 
Sixth, the mining school, Houghton, 1885. 
Seventh, schools for special classes: School for the Deaf, Flint, 1854; School for 
Dependent Children, Coldwater, 1874; School for the Blind, Lansing, 1880. 
Eighth, reformatory schools: Industrial School for Boys, Lansing, 1856; Industrial 
Home for Girls, Adrian, 1881. See ee

The board of judges, apparently, were most attracted by the exhi- 
bitions from the State superintendent’s office at Lansing, the State Uni- 
versity, the agricultural college, and by the exhibitions from the public 
schools of Bay City, Saginaw, and Ann Arbor. 
The exhibition of the university especially gave it appropriate rank 
among the institutions of its class. 
Friends of the schools in the State could but regret some of the 
important omissions, and naturally asked, “Do not these omissions 
point to a certain inadequacy in the organization of the State system? 
If that system operated with equal efficiency in every part of the 
State, and in every grade of instruction, would not the response in 
such a movement as this be more complete, place by place and grade 
by grade?” 
The report of the State superintendent for the current year, 1893, 
the fifty-seventh in the series for the State, is as usual a valuable doc- 
ument. From it a reasonable survey of the condition of education 
may be obtained, the attendance by localities and by grades, the num- 
ber of teachers, the receipts and expenditures, and the many items usu- 
ally contained in such reports. From it one can learn much in regard 
to the legal requirements regulating public schools, and the relation to 
the several public institutions to the system of public instruction. 
One feature of the report is unique and of special interest, and that 
is a series of sketches of the ex-superintendents of public instruction 
for the State, together with portraits of each, beginning with Rey. 
Davis Pierce and coming down to and including Cortland P. Stebbins, 
ex-deputy superintendent. 
The university is acknowledged to be the most conspicuous of State 
universities, and the normal school at Ypsilanti is justitying its founda- 
tion. The agricultural college was one of the first organized. The list 
of institutions incorporated but not sustained by the State contains col- 
leges and academies of marked merit. The retormatory work by the 
State deserves special attention. 
Remarkable as has been the influence of educators upon affairs in 
the United States, comparatively little attention has been paid to their 
personal history, in which would be found an explanation of the origin 
of many of the best things in our civilization.

  EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. His 
It should be noted that of the $8,000 expended on the educational 
exhibit of the State, only $2,000 were appropriated by the legislature, 
and over $4,000 were raised by penny contributions. It will be seen how 
great were the sacrifices of those who carried the exhibition through. 
WISCONSIN. 
Wisconsin is one of the States that sought, in connection with the 
educational exhibit, to give the widest, most permanent, and most ele- 
vatiug character to the influence of the occasion celebrated by the 
Columbian Exposition. 
Hon. E. O. Wells, the State superintendent of schools, issued the 
Columbian circular, containing patriotic and historic selections for 
October 21, 1892, together with the proclamation of President Harri- 
son issued in accordance with the resolution of Congress; also the 
proclamation of Governor Peck, in which he embodied the resolution 
offered by Hon. W. T. Harris, United States Commissioner of Educa- 
tion, and adopted by the department of superintendence of the National 
Educational Association at its meeting in Brooklyn, N.Y.,in February, 
1892. The circular was effective in arousing interest. Appropriate 
exercises were widely held. A large amount of valuable information 
took effect upon the thought of the people of the State. Especially were 
the children better prepared to understand the instructive occurrences 
connected with the Exposition. 
Worthy of special attention is a volume of 720 pages, “published 
under the authority and by the direction of the State committee on the 
educational exhibit for Wisconsin, 1893,” containing contributions from 
a large number of educators. _1t was edited by Prof. J. W. Stearns, of 
the State University, and editor of the School Journal, and specially 
promoted by Prof. William E. Anderson, who was for nine years super- 
intendent of schools, Milwaukee, and who did so much to make effect- 
ive the educational exhibit of the State. The volume is filled with 
valuable data. Much of it is written by those who took part in the 
events which they describe. It will be specially valuable to those who 
would study the educational progress of Wisconsin. 
With this history in hand and the educational exhibit before us the 
student can hardly fail to gain a correct view of the progress and 
conditions of education in the Commonwealth. 
Education began in a most primitive way under the Territorial 
organization. The State constitution has from the first required pro- 
vision for education. The legislative and administrative experience 
under that requirement furnish most important lessons, some of them 
full of serious meaning. 
The district, a subdivision of the town, as the smallest geographical 
and civil unit for school purposes, was imported into the State from 
New England before its evils had led to its rejection there. There 
the town was first the unit. The district or subdivision of the  
-P-A-G-E-1124
1114 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
town was adopted later, in an evil moment. and remained until its 
injurious effects compelled State after State to abolish district con- 
trol and return to the town system. The damage done in Wisconsin 
can not be recounted. Prejudice is so strong that unequal taxation, 
poor schoolhouses, inferior teachers, lack of grading in schools, and 
unnecessary expenses are tolerated rather than to adopt the township 
system in accordance with the law of 1869, which allows towns to do so 
at their option, by vote. Comparatively few towns have availed them- 
selves of this provision. 
Centers of population have thus effective independent organizations 
and carry on their own administration and supervision, reporting to 
the State superintendent. The constitution adopted in 1848 required a 
State superintendent, and the legislation of the next year provided for 
town superintendents. The State superintendent is ex-officio a member 
of the board of university regents and of the normal school regents. 
His responsibilities are great. He has an assistant and clerical aid. 
His relations to all the parts of the State system have a tendency to 
give harmony and increased efficiency to the whole. 
In 1860 a law was passed providing for county superintendents. The 
efficiency of the office has not always met expectations, especially when 
the salary has been too small to secure competent service, or when for 
any reason there is an incumbent who is not qualified for the important 
duties of the office. But, on the whole, the office has added greatly to 
the efficiency of the system and produced marked improvement in the 
schools in the last thirty years. Two counties, Dane and Rock, are 
reported to have each two superintendents. Some counties do not 
furnish stationery. 
High schools.—The progress of grading, resulting in high schools, was 
slow at first, but the experiment, when tried, proved its wisdom. The 
first high school class in the State is said to have graduated at Racine 
December 24, 1857. The Milwaukee high school opened in January, 
1868, with 128 pupils. In 1860 there were less than 50 graded schools 
in the State. The State Teachers’ Association in 1871 recommended a 
course of study for graded schools and for public high schools. City 
and county superintendents took similar action in behalf of county 
ungraded schools in the following year. In 1875 the legislature, to 
encourage the establishment of free high schools, passed a law making 
an annual appropriation of $25,000, of which each high school estab- 
lished might receive $500 and an additional sum pro rata for the popu- 
lation united in this action. 
To promote the best results the State superintendent proposed three 
full courses of study, two embracing four years, for cities of 6,000 popu- 
lation or over, and a third of three years for towns of less than 6,000 
people. In 1892 these high schools had increased to 182, or 192 includ- 
ing the 10 not aided by the State. 
The preparation of students in these schools for the State University 
began early to receive attention, but no special action was taken until
-P-A-G-E-1125
  EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. A115 
1870, when the State Teachers’ Association recommended that graded 
schools prepare for admission to the normal school and that high schools 
prepare for admission-to the university, on certificate, without exami- 
nation. Thenext year the State superintendent accentuated thisrecom- 
mendation, and the year after it was enacted into a law by the legis- 
lature. There are now reported 85 schools in the State and 89 in other 
States from which students are received into the university at Madison 
without examination, on the certificate of the principal. 
The State superintendent is provided with aid specially for inspect- 
ing high schools. In 1890 the State report of education declared the 
high schools the most potent factor in the educational system of the 
State. This is the very opposite of the situation generally in our 
eountry. Our secondary instruction has been confessedly the weakest 
point in our American system of schools. . 
A specially interesting fact has been brought out in the State report 
in connection with the financial condition of families sending pupils to 
the high school. Of 119 high schools reported it appeared that 6,369 
children attended, representing 5,491 families. Of these families 2,732 
were rated below $1,000 worth of taxable property as assessed by the 
State. Those rated between $1,000 and $25,000 numbered 5,645. Only 
216 families are rated above $10,000. In other words, more than one- 
half the patrons of the high schools are assessed at less than $1,000, 
more than. three-fourths below $2,500, and only 1 in 25 above $10,000. 
The State superintendent adds, “The free high school is emphatically 
the school of the poor man and of those in moderate circumstances.” 
As was to be expected under the circumstances, the public school 
exhibitof the State was mainly from the graded school system, in which 
the high school work wasprominent. Peshtigo was commended for excel- 
lence of system; the South Kaukauna high school, for methods fitted to 
develop reasoning powers; Green Bay, specially for early introduction 
of instruction in science; Little Chute, for general excellence; Racine, 
for simplicity and naturalness in all grades. The Milwaukee schools 
were commended by Miss Fredriksen, first, for comprehensive presen- 
tation of system, statistics, courses of study, and buildings; second, 
for good kindergarten work in clay, building, and tablet work; third, 
for good work in physiology and geography in all grades; fourth, for 
scientific work in high school; fifth, for mechanical drawing in high 
school; sixth, for practical manual training. The manual training 
school of Eau Claire received a special award. 
Normal schools—From the first the teacher was the center of all 
improvement in education in the State. Every friend of improvement 
looked tohim. How could his qualifications be advanced? State super- 
intendents constantly gave special attention to the answer of this ques- 
tion. Teachers’ institutes, known as temporary normal schools, were 
early held, sometimes wholly at the expense of the teachers, aided by 
a few friends of education. The constitution of 1848 recognized nor- 
mal schools, but there was lack of money for their organization. The   
 
-P-A-G-E-1126

university sought to promote the advance of qualifications among teach- 
ers, but it lacked means. Chancellor Lothrop asked of the legislature 
an appropriation of $2,000 to establish a professorship and to support 
a normal professor, “whose undivided time and energies should be 
devoted to the duties of his charge.” This was not granted. Professor 
Read, however, delivered two courses of professional lectures in 1856 
and 1857 on the art of teaching. Eighteen students attended in 1856 
and 28 in 1857. 
In 1857, after a struggle, two bills of quite opposite import resulted 
in the act for the encouragement of academies and normal schools, and 
set apart one-fourth of the income from the sale of swamp lands, and 
a board of normal school regents was created. The board did not 
establish separate normal schools, but aided institutions already estab- 
lished which adopted the prescribed normal course, and also allowed $30 
for each student pursuing that course. Excellent institutes formed 
normal classes, such as Lawrence University, Milton Academy, Allens 
Grove Academy, Beloit high school, Plattville Academy, Albion Acad- 
emy, and Waupaca high school, but the plan-did not work. The normal 
training was subordinated to common. academic work, and the result 
desired was not attained. In 1856 Dr. Henry Barnard, the eminent 
educator, was elected by the regents of the university its chancellor, 
and by the normal school regents their agent. He remained in these 
positions and did his utmost to elevate the educational thought and 
eftort of the State, devoting himself especially to improving the quali- 
fications of teachers and the work of the public schools. The growth 
of intelligent sentiment was such that in 1865 the legislature provided 
a larger endowment for normal instruction in the State in distinctively 
normal schools. In 1869 the acts relating to normal teaching were 
codified. 
February 28, 1866, the board of regents voted to locate normal schools 
at Whitewater and Plattville. At Plattville the local donation included 
the grounds and buildings of the academy, and that school opened Octo- 
ber 9, 1866, with Charles H. Allen as principal. Mr. Allen was then 
in charge of the normal department of the university. The White- 
water school was dedicated April 21, 1864. Oliver Arey became prin- 
cipal. He had brought the high school of Buffalo, N. Y., to a marked 
degree of success and had had favorable experience as principal of the 
Albany normal school, in which Mr. Page, author of Theory and Prac- 
tice, did his great work. 
The growth of the normal School work deserves extended study. It 
has greatly improved in quality and increased in amount. 
The fine schools located, respectively, at Plattville, Whitewater, 
Oshkosh, River Falls, and Milwaukee in 1890-1892 reported a total 
attendance in the normal department of 1,597—males, 498; females, 
1,099. Two courses of study are pursued—one of two years, fitting 
teachers for the country schools, and one of three years, fitting teachers

  EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. tas 
for the higher work of the graded schools. A model school, or prae- 
tice department, was attached to each school. Gradually students have 
required less in so-called academic studies, and been able to do more in 
pure pedagogical work. Since the opening of the first normal school, 
1,568 have completed the course, 792 the advanced course, and 776 the 
elementary course. About one-third are men. Ninety-five per cent 
have taught. It is estimated that 10,000 of those who have attended 
these schools but have not graduated have taught in the common 
schools, thus disseminating something of their better methods. These 
schools have always stood for high moral character and thoroughness 
of instruction among teachers, with increasing specialization toward 
principles and improved methods of education. Kindergarten and 
manual training have been taken up cautiously. 
The collective exhibit of these normal schools attracted aoc 
attention. It was commended by Judge Fry, first, for completeness as 
a distinct presentation of normal training; second, for the evidence of 
painstaking work on the part of the teachers, and intelligent effort on 
the part of the pupils, as seen in their practical criticism, methods of 
study, and indications of originality. The award to Plattville noted 
excellence of methods, results, especially in language, kindergarten, and 
child observation. That to Whitewater, first, the excellence of normal 
work inits entirety; second, the excellence of normal high professional 
aim; third, method of original work; fourth, pedagogical text-books 
by the faculty; fifth, good drawing. Special note was taken of the 
apparatus made by the pupils at River Falls. 
Music in the Milwaukee school was specially mentioned. 
All the schools shared in these excellencies. 
State University—It may be well to remember that Wisconsin was 
not erected into a separate Territory until 1836, and that it became a 
State in 1848, The first Territorial legislature met at Belmont, Iowa 
County, October 25, 1836. A law was passed protecting school lands, 
and an act establishing a university at Belmont. The trustees were 
authorized also to establish “colleges, academies, and schools depen- 
dent on the university.” Twelve years passed before the university 
had an actual existence. Meantime Madison became the capital, and 
the university was located there, the regents purchasing 50 acres of land. 
Meantime, also, the legislature freely chartered colleges and academies. 
February 5, 1849, a preparatory school was organized under Prof. J. W. 
Sterling, whose connection with the university continued thirty-four 
years. But the first university class, so called, was formed August 4, 
1850. The State did not give a dollar to the university before 1866, for- 
getting that the lands granted were given as a sacred trust for the main- 
tenance and support of a university, and that the State should do the 
rest. Thesum of $104,339.42, by act of the legislature, was taken from 
the fund and applied to the erection of buildings. Be it remembered, 
for the honor of the State, that this was restored by law. The wniver- CT ee
-P-A-G-E-1128

| : sity was meantime, however, so far crippled for funds for current 
teaching expenses. 
Early after the act of Congress of 1862 making grants of land for 
colleges of agriculture and mechanic arts was passed, the State turned 
its portion over to the university, the moneys derived therefrom to be 
known as the agricultural college fund. 
In 1866 a reorganization occurred. In the following year women 
were admitted. Normal instruction, which had been so long in mind, 
was formally provided for. A normal department was opened and 112 
students entered, of whom 76 were women. In 1869 this department 
was enlarged into a female college. In 1870 the State gave $50,000 for 
the erection of a hall for young ladies. In 1878 Hon. C. C. Washburn, 
once general, governor, and member of Congress, erected and equipped. 
the observatory at his own expense. = 
In 1876 the tax of one-tenth of a mill on the dollar on the assessed 
valuation of taxable property was authorized for the benefit of the uni- 
versity. In 1883 this tax was increased to one-eighth of a mill. In 
1891 a State tax of one-tenth of a mill was ordered levied for six years 
for the “erection and maintenance of buildings for the military, dairy, 
and law departments.” 
In 1885 the long struggling purpose to maintain a full normal pro- 
fessorship was realized in the establishment of the chair of the art 
and science of teaching. The very competent Prof. J. W. Stearns was 
elected. He had been professor in the Chicago University, now 
extinct. He had had special experience as principal of a Government 
normal school in Tucuman, in the Argentine Republic, and also for six 
years as principal of the normal school at Whitewater. He had also, 
by the State act of 1885, given annually thirty or forty public lectures 
in connection with teachers’ institutes. 
In 1888 a chair of agricultural physics was established; also a chair 
and laboratory of experimental and comparative psychology after the 
plan of the College of France. It comes into close relation to the 
normal schools by arranging two special normal courses. “ Prelegal, 
premedical, and prejournalistic” courses were also established. 
Farmers’ institutes were undertaken in 1886; already 61 have been 
held in a single year, with an attendance of 30,000. In 1887 a summer 
school of four weeks for teachers was opened, offering twenty courses 
of instruction, which has already reached an attendance of 191. In 
1892 the school of history, political science, and economics was created, 
and the distinguished Prof. R. 8. Ely, of Johns Hopkins, placed in 
charge. 
The thirteen years’ presidency of John Bascom, LL. D., commencing 
in 1874, marked, it will be seen, great progress in the university, which 
has been continued along similar lines under the administration of Dr. 
T,. C. Chamberlin and that of Dr. C. K. Adams, who comes to his respon-

sibility after rich-experience as professor at Ann Arbor and president 
of Cornell University. 
It may be said that the university is not only fast becoming a great 
university, but, in truth, the center of learning for the people of the 
State. The income of the university for the year ending June 30, 1892, 
is reported to be $268,510.60. Tuition is free to the residents of the 
State. 
The exhibit of the university was largely made up of photographs 
together with the record of changes published. The award of the judges 
could be appropriately given for progress and instructive changes in 
attendance, appropriations, courses of study, and results of instruction 
in the university, together with photographs of interior and exterior 
views. : 
For the entire educational exhibit of the State, Hon. J. H. Shinn 
could fitly recommend an award—first, for the evidence of good training 
from the common schools through the university; second, for excellent 
attainment of pupils in the elementary, secondary, college, and univer- 
sity instruction. 
The State Teachers’ Association, which exerted a most helpful influ- 
ence upon the course of educational progress in the State, represented ‘ 
by Prof. W. E. Anderson, was adjudged an award for the completeness 
of its historical presentation and progress of instruction, the establish- 
ment of the university, normal schools, colleges, and other institutions 
of learning in the State. \ 
State institutions for special classes.—Their exhibit was found joined 
with that of other institutions of this character. 
I, A. Lapham called the attention of Hon. M. M. Strong, president of 
the council of the Territory, as early as 1843 to the duty of providing 
instruction to the deaf and blind. _In 1848-49, Miss Wealthy Howes, 
a resident of Magnolia and a graduate of the New York Institution for 
the Deaf, began to teach Ariadne Cheseboro, a deaf girl, at her home, 
together with J. A. Dudley, a deaf boy. Mr. J. A. Mills, also from the 
New York school, took up the work for four months with six pupils. 
April 19, 1852, the Wisconsin Institution for the Education of the 
Deaf and Dumb was incorporated, to be located near the village of 
Delavan. The present site is known as Phoenix Green, comprising 37 
acres, of which 11 were donated by F. K, Phenix. The school has an 
instructive history. The buildings were burned on September 16, 1870, 
and rebuilt, with improvements, by the State in 1880. The course of 
instruction is elementary, covering ten years, having advanced work 
to be done at the National College at Washington, where twenty have 
entered. Instruction is given in industries, both in the manual and oral 
methods. Nine hundred and twenty have shared in the advantages of 
the institution. 
The establishment of the School for the Blind, at Janesville, followed 
a movement inaugurated by the citizens of that place the 27th of   
 
-P-A-G-E-1130
1120 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
August, 1849) The subscription was raised and a few pupils instructed. 
In February, 1850, the legislature chartered the Wisconsin Institution 
| for the Blind. The growth of the institution is full of interest. In 
| 1862 Superintendent Thomas H. Little announced three departments— 
literary, musical, and industrial. In 1878 kindergarten was intro- 
duced. In 1879 books printed for the blind, at Louisville, by the 
National Grant, began to come to the institution. In 1891-92 the 
school was graded to correspond with the graded schools of the State— 
“kindergarten, three primary, four grammar, and a four years’ high 
school course.” Piano tuning, typewriting, and housekeeping are 
taught. Attention is given to physical culture. The school is in ses- 
sion forty weeks each year. It is free to all blind children in the State, 
and, together with the school for the deaf and dumb, is regarded as a 
‘part of the State system of public instruction. The school is located 
—one main building—on 40 acres of land, on the south bank of Rock 
Creek, within the city limits. The officers, assistants, and pupils, 
October 1, 1892, numbered 120. 
Phe Phonological Institute.—In June, 1878, a permanent organization 
of those speaking German, and especially interested in the oral method 
for the deaf, was effected under this name. January 20, 1879, it was 
incorporated with 120 members. For atime its proceedings and records 
were in the German language. The Ladies’ Aid Society gave it special 
assistance. A norinal department for the training of teachers in oral 
method was started, and in connection with it a private day school. 
Prof. Alexander Graham Bell became interested. Governor Rusk 
recommended legislation to improve the treatment and education of 
deat-mutes. Professor Bell spent a couple of weeks explaining the 
measure to the members of the legislature. March 31, 1885, the bill 
became a law, by which was established what is now known as the 
Wisconsin system for the education of deaf-mutes. The State provided 
for the instruction of classes of deaf-mutes with the oral method, and 
appropriated $100 for each pupil taught. There are now schools and 
classes as follows: One in Milwaukee, with 42 pupils; one in Wausau, 
with 5 pupils; one in La Crosse, with 8 pupils; another is about to be 
established in Morristown. The same course of study is pursued as in 
the day schools. The normal department of the Phonologiéal Insti- 
tute has trained 22 teachers by the oral method. 
German and English Seminary and Academy, Milwaukee.—The exhibit 
of this institution attracted the attention of many special students. 
It very fitly received an award for excellence in drawing and especially 
in ideas of form and skill in casting. In fact the exhibit pointed to 
much that the award did not specify. Here work is done in accord with 
the most thorough German method, in both German and English, and 
is supported literally by Germans of wealth. The building is a model, 
in lighting, heating, and construction generally. For natural science 
teaching, a museum and chemical laboratory are provided, while the
-P-A-G-E-1131

kindergarten, manual training department for boys, needle and fancy 
work department for girls, and the gymnastic department, afford excel- 
lent opportunities alike for mental and physical training. Here young 
ladies and gentlemen are fitted for teaching both German and English. 
The methods follow closely those of the German teachers’ seminaries. 
Here, too, is permanently located the normal school of the North 
American German Union for the training of teachers of gymnastics. 
Downer Oollege.—This institution, named for its benefactor, is located 
at Fox Lake. It aims to give higher instruction to women. It is under 
the presidency of Miss Ellen C. Sabin, formerly superintendent of 
schools at Portland, Oreg. Downer College made a modest but effect- 
ive exhibit, and received an award from the board of judges for general 
excellence, wise direction, and great promise. 
The Spencerian Business College, Milwaukee, deserved the recogni- 
tion among business colleges which it received for excellence of methods 
generally, but especially in stenography and typewriting. 
| Catholic schools.—The collections from the Catholic schools were found. 
in the Catholic exhibit. Many participated, and a large proportion was 
, recognized in the awards. 
Not a few names preserve the memory of the first Catholic explorers 
and settlers. They early established schools, The State is now divided 
into dioceses, and they report 279 parochial schools. Of these, 140 are 
in the archdiocese of Milwaukee, 77 in the diocese of Green Bay, and 
62 in the diocese of La Crosse. These schools enroll 44,669 children; 
23,939, or nine tenths of all the Catholic children, being in the arch- 
diocese of Milwaukee, 12,200 in the diocese of Green Bay, and 8,530 
in that of La Crosse. 
Marquette Oollege.—This college, named for the eminent explorer, 
was chartered by the legislature in 1864. It had its beginnings in St. 
Aloysius Academy and St. Gall’s Academy. The curriculum is the 
same as that of the other Jesuit colleges in the United States. It 
embraces two courses, the commercial and the classical. The commer- 
cial fills four years. The classical is more comprehensive, and is divided 
into two departments—the academic, filling three years of training in 
the elements of English and the classics, and the collegiate, filling also : 
three years with higher studies. Catholic doctrine is given systematic- 
ally throughout all the courses, but the study of German and French 
is optional. The method is that of the famous Ratio of Studiorum of 
the Society of Jesus, adapted to the present circumstances. The Jesuits, 
as a teaching body, do not change courses or methods with the change 
of teachers; courses and methods remain the same. 
Catholic Normal School of the Holy Family, and Pio Nono College, St. 
Francis, near Milwaukee.—The special aim of this institution is the 
training of teachers for the Catholic parochial schools. Its imposing 
building was dedicated January 2,1871. In 1892-93 over 100 students 
were enrolled. Here the American Cecilian Society was founded in 
1878, for the cultivation of true ecclesiastical music.

The Provincial Seminary of St. Francis of Sales—This institution, or 
theological seminary, for the training of the priesthood, dates back to _ 
efforts made in 1853, More than 600 priests, as well as distinguished 
bishops, received training here. 
St. Johvs Institute for Deaf-mutes.—This school, located at St. 
Francis, near Milwaukee, was opened May 10, 1876. It furnishes one 
of the specially interesting features of Catholic education in the State. 
The majority in attendance are the children of the poor. For a time 
the oral method was employed, but it was finally given up for lack of 
time. A special feature is the training of the pupils in the manufacture 
of church furniture, altars, pulpits, and all kinds of carved work used 
on pulpits. Orders come in from various quarters. It has an excel- 
lent plant, and turns out from $20,000 to $30,000 worth of work annu- 
ally. The usual instruction in English is given to boys and girls. 
Girls are also taught domestic economy. 
The Catholic institutions in the State are generally reported eo: 
large endowments, and are therefore supported by much self-sacrificing 
effort. The large number of them which participated in the exhibition, 
and the fullness, variety, and excellence of their collections, gave evi- 
dence of their fidelity to the call of those who sought that there should 
be no pause in the progress of improved methods. 
MINNESOTA. 
The expert, studying the exhibition of education from this State soon 
saw indications of a closeness of relation and fitness of part to part 
which indicated system. There is little room for the waste arising either 
from overlapping or from lack of harmony. The College of Agriculture 
and Mechanic Arts isa part of the university. Their work, however 
it may differ in any respect, is a unit in purpose. In this, as in the 
saving of the university from its early wreck, or from the mistake in the 
use of its lands, the wise devotion and labor of Hon. John 8. Pillsbury, 
as state senator, and governor during three terms, have borne most 
abundant fruit. Fortunately, he is still a laborious trustee. The uni- 
versity has had only two presidents since its reorganization, Hon. W. 
W. Folwell, LL. D.,now an honored professor, and Hon. Cyrus Nor- 
throp, LL. D., its present able and efficient administrative officer. It is 
fast becoming one of our leading State universities in quality, breadth 
of work, andin attendance. Toward the university, with all its oppor- 
tunities, the pupils in each center or part of the graded system find 
themselves passing naturally, without strain, grade by grade. The high 
schools have good courses and fill well their place in the system; they 
are well manned and are strong in the affections of the people. The 
normal schools are efficient, and take their place without a jar. Under 
the wise administration of the Hon. D. L. Keile, LL. D., the extension 
through the entire system of sound pedagogical principles has gone 
rapidly forward; in afew years no State should excel this in its appli-

cation to every detail of educational work. County supervision, as 
a rule, is efficient. Much attention has been given to buildings, Duluth 
claiming to excel in its building for the high school. St. Pauland Min- 
neapolis, fortunately, have had able superintendents, who have held 
the work up to a high standard, and taken care to introduce good 
teachers. 
Kindergartens are having a healthy growth, so also is manual train- 
ing, without doing harm to instruction in other subjects. Libraries are 
beginning to do their work both for pupils and those who have passed 
beyond the school age. The board of judges, in addition to the merits 
they saw in the office of the State superintendent, and of the univer- 
sity, and of the several normal schools, pointed out the excellencies 
they saw in the exhibit from a considerable number of cities and towns, 
including Minneapolis, St. Paul, Duluth, Stillwater, Winona, Hen- 
derson, Richfield, and Redwing. An award was given to the School 
for the Feeble-Minded, at Faribault. Carlton College, under religious — 
auspices, located at Northfield, participated in the exhibition and was 
awarded a diploma. 
IOWA. 
Anyone studying the Iowa educational exhibit would find it diffieult 
to believe that it came from a State in which the legislature half a cen- 
tury ago took retrogressive action with regard to schools and abolished 
the office of State superintendent of instruction. There were, however, 
pioneers in the State who were ready to support schools before they 
were provided by law, and their spirit has prevailed and brought about 
the present system of public education, embracing elementary, second- 
ary, and normal schools, schools for the blind, dumb, and feeble-minded, 
a college of agriculture and the mechanic arts, and a State university, 
the whole sustained by the people in accordance with the organic law 
of the State. Unfortunately, the unity of the entire system of instrue- 
tion is not presented in the exhibition. Iowa, like her sister States, 
shared in the great educational land grants from the National Govern- 
ment. Her pioneers encountered the usual hardships. Many mistakes 
marked the early educational history. However, in 1856, Govertior 
Grimes had the wisdom to recommend that a commission be appointed 
to revise the laws with regard to the lands and to schools. This was 
done, and Horace Mann, then president of Antioch College, and Amos 
Dean, of the Albany Law School and chancellor of the University of 
Towa, and Mr. Bissel, of Dubuque, were named. “Mr. Bissel was unable 
to act,and Mr. Mann and Mr. Dean did the work, and the result was the 
school law of 1858, which has done so much for education. So rapid 
was the progress of education from this date that it could be said of 
the public schools that “they were able to resist the shock of the civil 
war more successfully than any other interest.” It is worth remember- 
ing that this law made each township a district; all residents, colored

1124 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
as well as white, between the ages of 5 and 21, could attend school. 
The property of the State must educate the children of the State. 
Graded schools were continued, and each board of directors fixed the 
branches to be taught; a county superintendent was to examine 
teachers and visit schools; aid was provided for teachers’ institutes; 
high schools were authorized; districts could purchase Webster’s dic- 
tionary and libraries; the whole was brought under the supervision of 
a State executive school officer. In 1876 it was provided by law that 
no person “shall be deemed ineligible by reason of sex to any school 
office in the State,” and women have since become school directors and 
superintendents. The map that shows the location of the high schools 
in the State gives good evidence of the strength and efficiency of the 
public school system. Teachers’ institutes have done a great work in 
Iowa. Dr. J. L. Pickard conducted an institute in Dubuque as early 
as 1849. More or less normal training was furnished in colleges. Prof. 
S. N. Fellows became instructor in the normal department of the uni- 
versity in 1867, and the State normal school was opened under J. C. 
Gilchrist as principal September 14, 1876; his associates were N. W. 
Bartlett, A. M.; D. 8S. Wright, A. M.; Miss Frances L. Webster, and 
EB. W. Burnham. 
In 1893, under Homer H. Seerley, A. M., as president, the attendance 
reached 811. In 1858 the State provided for an agricultural college and 
appropriated $10,000 for the purpose, but gave no further aid for six 
years. The national grant was accepted in 1862, The institution has not 
been marked by that intelligent and steady support which it deserves; 
the attendance, however, has advanced to about 300. The State Uni- 
versity has grown out of the national university grant and the gift of 
saline lands. It was established by an act of the legislature approved 
February 25, 1847. It has experienced varied fortune. The several 
able presidents found their post beset with many difficulties. During 
the administration of President Pickard marked changes were effected, 
bringing the work of the university more in harmony with its great 
central idea. Dr. Pickard had great advantage in guiding these 
changes from his experience as a young man in the East, as principal 
for: thirteen years of Plattsville Academy, Wisconsin; as superintend- 
ent of public instruction for four years for that State, and for thirteen 
years superintendent of Chicago public schools. Among the great 
changes made under his presidency may be mentioned the abolition of 
the preparatory department, the articulation of the high schools with 
the university, the increase of electives and of the work of several 
chairs, such as natural science and history. It has been described “as 
gratefully remembered by students as a period in their lives when they 
-were environed by influences which tended to cause physical culture 
to seem good, intellectual enlargement to appear better, and highest 
character to be deemed best of all.” Under C. A. Shaefer, president, 
the university is advancing along established lines, adding new attrac-

tions as opportunities offer. The university extension is receiving 
attention. Although the high schools have done a great work in sec- 
ondary education in the State, institutions of this grade, under private 
direction, have been found useful and received very considerable sup- 
port. Notable among them is Cedar Valley Seminary, founded in 1862, 
located at Osage; principal, Alonzo Abernathy, Ph. D., for four years 
the efficient superintendent of public instruction. Its attendance has 
reached over 200. 
There are numerous denominational colleges. All have preparatory 
= departments, nearly all of them admit women as students, and most of 
them have women in their faculties. The Baptists have three institu- 
tions—Burlington University, Central University, at Pella, and the Des 
Moines College. The Church of Christ (Christian) maintains Drake 
University, at Des Moines, which has reported an enrollment of 907 
students. They also maintain Oskaloosa College. The Congregation- 
alists have two colleges, one at Tabor and one at Grinnell. Tabor has 
maintained itself through a remarkable series of trials. The college 
has now five buildings and its prospect is improving. Iowa College 
was incorporated in 1847. Its first president, George F. Magoun, D. D., _ 
was elected in 1862, and entered formally upon his duties in 1865, 
and remained until 1884, Under his able presidency, in spite of the 
greatest hardships, the college continued to grow with a faculty increas- 
ing to 15 and the attendance to 350, and having enrolled altogether 
4,000 students. Under President George A. Gates the attendance has 
advanced to 588, Among its alumni it names H. H. Belfield (1858), 
director of the Chicago Manual Training School; Irving J. Manatt 
(1869), consul at Athens, Greece, and previously chancellor of the 
University of Nebraska; Jesse Macy (1870), author of Our Govern- 
ment; Henry C, Adams (1874), professor in Michigan University and 
statistician of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and Albert Shaw 
(1879), American editor of the Review of Reviews. The Episcopalians 
have established Griswold College, at Davenport. Its real estate is 
already valued at $325,000, and has a productive endowment of 
$80,000. The Friends have two colleges—Penn College, at Oskaloosa, 
and Whittier College, at Salem. The Methodists have five institutions 
for superior instruction—Wesleyan University, at Mount Pleasant; 
Simpson College, at Indianola; the University of the Northwest, at 
Sioux City; Upper Iowa University, at Fayette, and Cornell College, 
so long under the presidency of Rev. W. I’. King, D. D., LL. D., located 
at Mount Vernon. Bishop Haven said, “‘ Never have I seen a lovelier 
landscape than that which stretches out from Mount Vernon.” The 
college was founded by Dr. Bowman. Dr. King has been president 
since 1863, and the enrollment has advanced to 600 and over. The 
exhibition of the college at Chicago was substantial, instructive, and 
deserved the award which it received from the board of judges. 
 
-P-A-G-E-1136
  1126 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
The United Brethren maintain Western College, at Toledo, which has 
375 students. Amity College, undenominational, is located at College 
Springs. The Presbyterians maintain Coe College, at Cedar Rapids; 
Lenox College, at Hopkinton, and Parsons’ College, located at Fairfield. 
Had all these institutions adequately participated in the exhibition 
much would have been added to its value and much instructive history 
would have been brought to public attention. The school statistics 
were presented in a very effective manner. A map drawn by a pupil 
of the Montezuma schools presented at a glance the location of each 
one of the 13,275 public schools of the State. There was also an inter- 
esting chart giving comparative statistics. The work of the State 
office was brought out with good effect. The showing of kindergarten 
work was small, but indicating that the idea is receiving favor among 
the teachers in many of the cities. Drawing is making good progress; 
nature studies apparently receive limited attention. The same is true 
of manual training. 
The number of awards bestowed upon city schools was deservedly 
large. The school for the feeble minded received especial recognition, 
The collections from Catholic schools were found in the Catholic edu- 
cational exhibit. In addition to the usual class work, they exhibited 
typewriting, business forms, music, and knitting, embroidery, and fancy 
work by girls. Mrs. F. Hutchinson’s school at Cedar Rapids received 
an award for designs in silk, and Eliot’s Business College at Burlington 
for bookkeeping, typewriting, and stenography. 
MISSOURL. 
The visitor to the educational exhibit of Missouri was fortunate if 
he had in hand the pamphlet entitled The Educational System of 
Missouri. True, it did not contain a description of some of the most 
important features exhibited, omitting as it did to give any specific 
information in regard to such most instructive collections as those from 
St. Louis and Kansas City, but it was in effect a key to the State sys- 
tem of education. It makes clear that the object so long sought by 
the most eminent educators of the State, a system crowned with an 
efficient university and grading down to the primary school is already 
substantially realized. The whole may be said to date back to the 
organic act of Congress by which the Territory of Missouri was in 
1812 erected out of Louisiana, which provided that religion, morality, 
and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness 
of mankind, schools and the means of education shall be encouraged 
and provided for from the public lands of the United States in said 
Territory in such manner as Congress shall deem expedient. The gift 
of section 16 in every township followed. Fortunately, for a consider- 
able number of years no sales were allowed. In 1831 the legislature 
granted the right to county courts to sell these lands and loan the pro- 
ceeds. Asa result, in some cases the lands and proceeds were well
-P-A-G-E-1137
  
EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1127 
husbanded, in others the lands sold at nominal prices and perhaps 
the income squandered. Out of the wreck, however, there remain 
$3,370,369.90. Another fund, known as the county fund, was derived 
from the sale of swamp and overflowed lands, amounting to about 
4,000,000 acres. This went through a similar experience of mis- 
management, but now amounts to $3,788,559.28. What was known as 
the State common school fund was derived from the surplus distributed 
from the United States Treasury in°1837 and from the sale of saline 
lands given by the United States Government. Thus it will be seen 
what a large patron the National Government was of public common 
school education in Missouri. A debt of gratitude is due to those who 
labored for the honest and efficient administration of these national 
gifts to education. Among the most valiant defenders of these funds 
was Hon. R. D. Shannon, State superintendent of instruction. The 
organization and administration from the university down is regulated 
by the State legislature. The university, under its scholarly and accom- 
plished president, R. H. Jesse, LL. D., is advancing in efficiency in all 
its departments. It has already accomplished much for the lower 
grades of instruction by bringing into such close relations with itself 
53 high schools scattered over the State that their graduates are 
admitted without examination to its courses in the academic depart- 
ment and the College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts. The prep- 
aration of teachers for their important duties is provided for by a pro- 
fessor of the theory and practice of teaching in the university, by the © 
normal training furnished in such cities as St. Louis and Kansas City, 
and by the normal schools at Kirksville, Warrensburg, and Cape 
Girardeau, for whites, and in Lincoln Institute, in Jefferson City, for 
blacks. 
The entire exhibition of the State deserved careful study. The 
pupils’ work from Harrisville, Nevada, and Mexico had points of excel- 
lence which deserved recognition, but the cities of St. Louis, with its 
population of 450,245, and Kansas City, with its population of 132,416, 
by the last census, crowned the State public school exhibit in point of 
excellence. 
Both cities showed the results of philosophical system, part fitting 
part, and each part, either subject or grade, fitted to its plan, and 
adapted according to sound principles and by the best methods to do 
the work assigned it, and to help toward the great end in view. 
The St. Louis system led the way, under the guidance of the practical 
and philosophical care of Supt. William T, Harris, and has continued 
its wise and effective course under the devoted and prudent guidance 
of. Supt. E. H. Long. 
Here, under the supervision of Dr. Harris, by the devoted and skill- 
ful efforts of Miss Blow, kindergarten was adopted into the public 
school system, and thus St. Louis was the pioneer in the movement 
which has led so many cities to make the kindergarten a part of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-1138
  
1128 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
public school programme. The high school, under Professor Soldan, is 
one of established merit. The normal training is of a high order. 
Kansas City has been fortunate in the continued able and devoted 
supervision of J. M. Greenwood. If as a city it did not lead at the 
start, its schools have come to rank among the best. Merit is limited 
to no grade, but is found from the kindergarten to the high school. 
Here the use of the pen and pencil are introduced together, and the 
upright stroke in writing is well established. 
There were reported in 1892 in attendance in public kindergartens 
in the State of Missouri 6,890 pupils, of whom 6,830 were in St. Louis. 
ST. LOUIS MANUAL TRAINING SCHOOL, 
A leaflet prepared by Prof. C. M. Woodward, its able director, gave 
the desired information. The St. Louis Manual Training School is a 
subdepartment of Washington University. Besides the usual college 
or literary department, the university contains six professional schools, 
all of high grade: Engineering, law, medicine, dentistry, fine arts, and 
a school of botany. There are three subdepartments: An academy 
for girls, a classical school for boys, and the manual training school. 
Graduates of the three last enter the undergraduate department (col- 
lege and engineering school) as freshmen. This shows that the manual 
training school is a school of secondary grade. 
The manual training school was organized to effect several ends: ~ 
(1) To furnish a broader and more appropriate foundation for higher 
technical education. 
(2) To serve as a developing school where pupils may discover their 
innate capacities and aptitudes, whether in the direction of literature, 
science, engineering, or the practical arts while securing a liberal 
elementary training. 
(3) To furnish those who look forward to industrial life with a suit- 
able preparation. : 
(4) To stimulate and develop the whole boy by cultivating memory, 
taste, observation, invention, judgment, will, and habits of industry, 
circumspection, precision, and exact thought. It is thus seen that the 
manual training school is a school for general rather than for special 
education. It preserves all approved methods of promoting intellectual 
growth and vigor, but is not limited to them. While it adds a new 
culture, it enhances the value of old ones. It is not a trade school, nor 
a professional school, though it covers three years, the conditions of 
admission being substantially the same as for good high schools. The 
scheme of academic and manual work embraces five parallel lines, as 
follows: 
(1) A course of pure mathematics, including arithmetic, algebra, and 
geometry. 
(2) A course in science and applied mathematics, including ele- 
mentary physics, commercial geography, botany, chemistry, natural 
philosophy, mensuration, and bookkeeping.  
-P-A-G-E-1139
  
  EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1129 
(3) A coursein language and literature, including English grammar, 
spelling, rhetoric, composition, literature, history, and the elements of 
civics and political economy. Latin, French, and German are intro- 
duced as electives with a part of the English and science. 
(4) A course in penmanship, free-hand and instrumental drawing. 
(5) A course of tool instruction, including joinery, wood carving, 
wood turning, molding, pattern making, brazing, soldering, forging, 
and bench and machine work in metals. 
There is no option as to the kind or extent of shopwork; no narrow 
selection is permitted. None of the work here exhibited, except the 
programmes and descriptive drawings, was made for this Fair. Selec- 
tions were made from regular class work, and several specimens of each 
exercise are presented, so as to show that none of the work is excep- 
tional. It is all student work. No skilled workers are employed to 
execute the difficult parts. Every piece of shopwork is made from a 
drawing. As a rule the drawings here seen belong to the boys who 
made them and must be returned to them. 
NORTH DAKOTA. 
The two great States, North and South Dakota, were carved out of 
the Territory for some years known as Dakota. There was a strong 
and active disposition to sell the lands intended for educational pur- 
poses, or in some way divert them during the Territorial period; but 
by the watchful care of friends in the Territory, aided by the watch- 
fulness of the Bureau of Education at Washington, this was pre- 
vented, and these States, when organized, came into the inheritance 
of a large domain sacred to the education of youth. The income from 
this source has been found already helpful and will continue to be so 
while the honor of the State lasts. 
The following is the statement furnished of lands assigned to educa- 
tional purposes in North Dakota:

The State was fortunate in having early as State superintendent of 
public instruction the Hon. John Ogden, who was prepared by long 
experience and wide observation to select for the people the best things 
in education. In preparing for the exhibition he sought that the schools 
should speak for themselves and tell the story “of their birth, purpose, 
and present progress.” In addition to the usual communications by 
letter and circulars advising and stimulating effort for the exhibition, 
he spent some six weeks in actual organization and in inspecting the 
work to be sent forward from more than twenty of the leading schools 
in both city and country. He early sought to add from private means 
to the $20,000 appropriated by the State. The plan of the exhibit was 
excellent; the views of buildings and grounds showed careful attention 
to pedagogical conditions; the programmes of study were constructed 
on the most improved principles; the work of the pupils, especially from 
the chief towns, indicated good methods. There was good kindergarten 
work, particularly from Fargo. Good drawing is already taught, as was 
seen in most of the city work, notably in that of Valley City and James- 
town among the smaller places. The high merit of work from the large 
cities, such as Fargo and Grand Forks, was manifest. Examples in the 
common branches from the remote schools and sparsely settled counties 
gave evidence of the extension of the advantages of the public school 
system to the most out-of-the-way pioneer settlements. What this sig- 
nifies for these young States can not be described. Already the bene- 
ficial influences of the higher institutions of learning established is 
recognized. The agricultural college was opened to students on the 5th 
of January, 1892. It is located near Fargo, and its grounds and farm 
comprise 640 acres. Each county in the State is given one scholarship. 
*The two normal schools, one at Valley City and the other at Mayville, 
are doing promising work. The university, located at Grand Forks, 
was chartered by the Territorial legislature on the 27th of February, 
1883. In 1884-85 the attendance was 79; in 1891-92, 343. 
The character of the faculty is a guaranty of good-pioneer work.   
SOUTH DAKOTA, 
This exhibition was specially promoted by the ladies of the State 
cooperating with its educators. Before the legislature made an appro- 
priation the woman’s commission had raised a considerable amount 
of money. Its effective installation was due to Mrs. E. P. Farr, of 
Pierre, an educated lady and an experienced teacher, who was one of 
the most industrious and persistent judges in Department L. Had all 
judges worked as faithfully, the task of those who did labor would have 
been far less exacting. Superintendent of Instruction J. W. Mauck 
devoted special attention to the exhibit, and deserves credit for its 
merit. It was comprehensive of the educational system of the State. 
The university set forth its plans in reports, catalogues, statistical 
charts, album of views, and a variety of students’ work; the agricul-

tural college exhibited illustrative photographs; the normal school 
exhibited four volumes of work. The number of towns and districts 
that participated was large. Some of the centers of population gave 
evidence of having well-graded systems. Pupils’ work from country 
districts gave evidence of great ability of the teachers, and of intelligent 
and earnest work on the part of pupils. Both kindergarten and man- 
ual training are beginning to receive attention. From some cities the 
drawing was in excellent taste. The large map showing the number 
and location of all school buildings of every kind, public, private, and 
denominational, as well as the large map showing the location and area 
| of all school lands, with statistics, was especially full of promise for the 
| future. The first schoolhouse in Dakota, in oil, was exhibited by Mrs. 
D.P. Ward. The awards given to the State were discriminating and 
were bestowed upon the State as a whole, upon the State University, 
upon the systems of some of the leading towns, and upon the common 
schools of two counties. The Catholic schools were included in their 
special exhibit, and several of them were recognized among the awards. . 
NEBRASKA, 
The educational exhibit from this State had a close resemblance to 
that of others similarly situated; you were sure it was American. The 
efforts of the State superintendent in behalf of the exhibit was mani- 
fest, and received an award. All grades, including the university, were 
represented. Under President Canfield the university has enjoyed 
more peace and consequently been more prosperous. Its laboratory 
work was well brought out. In the public school collections, manual 
training was not so extensively represented proportionately as in some 
of the other States. Llustrative lessons were largely exhibited and full 
of interest, showing the intelligence, fidelity, and skill of the teachers, 
and often the invention of the pupils. The school collections of Omaha 
Jed, but others followed closely from York, Hastings, Stanton, Beatrice, 
Lancaster, Holdredge, Wyman, Grand Island, Parnell, and Nebraska 
City, and each received an award naming its points of excellence. 
KANSAS. 
The spirit of liberty, so characteristic of this State, has never failed 
to manifest interest in the edueation of the people. The schools of the 
State, as in other cases, were not all represented; but there was afforded 
a fair opportunity to study their characteristics. The effect of the 
superiority of individual teachers or officers, or of a local spirit, was 
seen here as elsewhere. One could not fail to recognize the influence of 
the proximity of so large a center as Kansas City, in Missouri, which is 
due in no small degree to the éfficiency of the eminent educator, Hon.

ances, methods, and principles. In some cases it is to be confessed that 
injury has been done by too frequent changes of officers and teachers. 
The exhibit as a whole did the State credit. The methods of the 
kindergarten are by no means universal in the schools, but they have 
taken firm hold, and by a considerable number of teachers and officers 
are well understood and intelligently employed. From the kindergarten 
to the most advanced university work the State system is showing 
increasing steadiness and efficiency, whether there is under observation 
the university itself, or the college of agriculture, or the normal school, 
including the increasing of the number of high schools as well as those of 
a lower grade. Everywhere, as officer and teacher, or pupil, woman 
has her place. The several disseminating agencies under the State 
superintendent, aided by educational journalism, are carrying into every 
part of the commonwealth the best there is in education. The calami- 
ties which have overtaken industry have necessarily affected the school 
work. The board of judges, in their critical examination, granted 
diplomas to the State school office, State university, college of agricul- 
ture, normal school, and to a considerable number of towns, and to the 
rural schools of several counties. 
COLORADO. 
The visitor approaching the Colorado exhibit will recall the fact that 
the State was admitted to the Union in 1876, the year of the Centennial 
at Philadelphia. 
The exhibit is one of a series that point to the increase in number of 
States in the few years which have elapsed since that Exposition. It 
affords great assurance to the patriotic statesman that these new 
States have laid, in the education of the people, a foundation for future 
order, prosperity, and greatness. Here, too, becomes apparent the care 
of the General Government. Each university, each college of agricul- 
ture and its experiment station has, by aid of grants from the National 
Government had a financial foundation at the start, to give assurance 
of success to the first feeble efforts after tho organization of the State. 
The same is emphatically true of the common schools. The granting 
of the sixteenth section of land to the support of common schools, 
dating back to the ordinance of 1787, which applied to all the territory 
~ owned by the United States northwest of the Ohio, has been a most 
potent factor in the progress of the intelligence of the people in all the 
States formed since that date. True, a number of States mismanaged 
the great national beneficence, and lost much of the advantage it was 
intended.to secure. The States more recently organized come into the 
possession of a magnificent domain set apart to common schools and 
universities, preserved, so far, intact, in no small measure by the vigi- 
lant efforts of the United States Bureau of Education, which spared no 
pains to resist every scheme for the perversion of this great grant, and 
did its utmost to quicken a local sentiment to enter upon its adminis-

tration well informed of the instructive experience of the States that 
had previously entered upon the use or abuse of this heritage. Indeed 
we must turn to the annual reports of the National Bureau of Educa- 
tion for the fullest annual data of the education of this vast region 
before its organization into States. There foreign students will find a 
solution of the puzzle which they encounter in the history of the edu- 
cation of the new States. In these reports they will learn of efforts 
which created the systems of education in these States and made them 
ready for efficiency upon the first entrance to statehood. 
Colorado fitly suggests its growth of common schools by setting a 
model of its earliest district schoolhouse over against the exhibition of 
the improved architecture and conveniences of its most recent school 
structures, which were the admiration of so many visitors. The State 
system of education has in it elements well adapted to efficiency. Its 
supervision is provided (1) for the State, (2) for counties, (3) for cities 
or large centers of population. Good provision is made for local 
action. The State brings the different parts of the State activity in 
education into a fair measure of correlation or cooperation, viz, the 
common schools, normal schools, college of agriculture and mechanic 
arts, and the State University. Charters are granted the institutions 
of learning by the legislature, as in other States. 
As Denver has outnumbered other cities of the State in population, 
soit has been called upon to lead in educational influence. Fortu- 
nately, it early secured Hon. Aaron Gove as the superintendent of its 
city schools. He had not only the love of the work to be done and 
the ability to do it, but he had a rare equipment. His is one of 
the names of eminence associated with the early years of the Normal 
University of Illinois, founded by Gen. C. E. Hovey. His experience 
as a Union officer and teacher added to his outfit. He believed that 
Denver and Colorado ought to have the best there is in education. 
The exhibition gives good evidence of his wisdom and that of those 
who with him have done the work of laying the foundation of educa- 
tion in the State. 
Hon. J. H. Shinn, superintendent of schools for Arkansas, commended 
in strong terms the State exhibit of Colorado for, first, the fine display 
of college and normal school work; second, the large display from the 
public schools; third, for careful provision for the complete education 
of all the children of the State; fourth, the sound pedagogy of the mass 
of the schools and especially those of Denver; fifth, for the manifestly 
careful supervision of the ex-State superintendent, Hon. Nathan B. Coy. 
The exhibit of the schools of Denver was made especially realistic by 
the aid of the stenographer and the phonograph. The stenographer 
gave an exact report, mistakes and all, of the course of exercises in a 
given grade or school. The phonograph preserved the exact tones of _ 
the voices of teachers in reading and music. The plans of schoolhouses, 
the principles and methods of organization, administration, and instruc-
-P-A-G-E-1144

tion were much commended. The exhibits of Greeley, Colorado Springs, 
Pueblo, Boulder, Longmont, and Leadville compare with Denver, or 
follow closely the lines of its suecess. The normal school at Greeley 
received strong commendation. The judge said that the exhibit 
deserved an award, first, for a large and varied collection, well installed, 
containing charts used as a device for showing the semiconcrete idea 
involved, the amount of knowledge gained, and the test of its assimila- 
tion; second, for sloid work arranged by programmes from the kinder- 
garten to the high school, setting. forth the usefulness of the articles 
made, the accuracy of pupils in drawing, making drawings, and the 
working from them, together with essays by students on the tools and 
articles used, and the economies thereof; third, work in science after 
Agassiz, testing power to apprehend the object studied and to express 
in drawing as well as in words what was seen, together with the usual 
class work; fourth, programmes and work in (a) kindergarten, ()) Eng- 
lish, (c) arithmetic and other studies; fifth, specimens of study, show- 
ing protessional training in the laboratory method of investigating and 
reviewing each subject by clearness of thought, accuracy of expression, 
and excellence of elaboration in the history and philosophy of educa- 
tion, applied methods and psychology not limited to text-books, but 
studying self, others, literature, and history. 
The school at Colorado Springs for blind and deaf is doing excellent 
work. The school of mines at Golden promises great usefulness in 
applying science to the great mining interests of the State. 
The agricultural college at Fort Collins has already won a strong 
position by its helpfulness in solving the problem of agriculture peculiar 
to the State. : 
The State University at Boulder has laid good foundations, and 
promises to keep up with the increasing demands of the growing popu- 
lation. 
Of the chartered institutions for superior instruction under private 
direction the university (Methodist) at Denver and the college (Con- 
gregational) at Colorado Springs are the most notable. 
Connected with the educational exhibit of the State, several private 
exhibits have special merit; among them may be mentioned the so-called 
alphabet busy work, by Miss J. M. Mitchell, associating the phonetic 
sound with the form of the letter; the McDonald globe; the Carter 
desk easel to be used in teaching drawing, and the contour map of the 
State, by Messrs. Coy, Jackson, and Van Diest. 
The Catholic schools of the State were represented in the Catholic 
exhibit and received much commendation for their general excellence, 
but especially for needlework and embroidery, typewriting, bookkeep- 
ing, Bible history, and music.

  EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1135 
ARKANSAS. 
The educational exhibit of Arkansas represented the schools both of 
the white and the colored population, and in addition to the common 
schools the work of the State included that of the normal schools, the 
colleges of agriculture and mechanic arts, the university, and other 
institutions of superior instruetion. 
The public school system is administered under the legal enactments 
of the State. The chief executive officers are the State superintendent 
of public instruction, county examiners or superintendents, and city 
superintendents of schools. 
The excellence of the State exhibit of education is ernecl ae due to 
the energy and zeal of Hon. Josiah H. Shinn, the State superintendent 
of public instruction. The State adopts for its motto in respect of edu- 
cation “A well-educated child is the best legacy possible to leave to the 
State.” 
The advance of instruction, especially in recent years, is full of 
encouragement. Better buildings are erected, better qualifications are 
required on the part of teachers, and more interest is shown by parents. 
In 1883 the expenditures reported for education were $479,471, and in 
1890, $1,622,510.28; and in 1891 the school enrollment reached half a 
Sa: Careful provision is made for the education of the deaf, dumb, 
and blind. The schools in the larger towns and cities, especially in 
Pine Bluff, Helena, Batesville, Fort Smith, and Little Rock, deserve 
the high commendation so generally bestowed. 
Separate schools are provided for the blacks and whites. The plant, 
the buildings, grounds, machinery, and other appliances for the Colored 
Industrial School at Pine Bluff have been selected with reference to 
the best and most recent standards. 
KENTUCKY. 
In spite of the obstacles in the way of friends of education in this 
State, it made an exhibit of education honorable to themselves, honor- 
able to the localities and institutions participating, and helpful to their 
work. The judges pointed out appropriately in their awards the 
excellence of the office of the superintendent, of the university at Lex- 
ington, and of the schools of Louisville, especially noting the free kin- 
dergarten and the manual training and high school and the public 
schools of Lexington and Frankfort; the text-books and work of Eph- 
raim Smith, and the school work from the seminary under Dr. Sayre, 
both of Lexington. The work for both the feeble-minded and the 
blind in the State has for years attracted special attention, and both 
the school for feeble-minded at Frankfort and the American Printing 
House for the Blind, at Louisville, received awards. The number of 
Catholic institutions on which awards were bestowed was compara- 
tively large, located in the principal towns — eight at Covington.

WEST VIRGINIA. 
This State, which constituted a part of Virginia until set off by itself 
during the civil war, did not make a full exhibit of its educational work, 
but set forth quite faithfully, as far as it went, the progress of the com- 
mon schools for the education of its people. It consisted chiefly of 
pupils’ work from the various grades, reports, photographs, and other 
articles illustrating educational conditions. The judges, in granting 
awards, pointed out special excellencies in the schools of Wheeling, 
Parkersburg, Charlestown, Fairmount, Martinsburg, Morgantown, and 
Mount Pleasant. The office of the State superintendent received 
an award. <A unique feature was the collection from twenty-three vil- 
lages. Educational progress is greatly indebted to the aid received 
from the Peabody fund. 
FLORIDA. 
Considering: the embarrassing circumstances, this State deserves 
great credit for its educational exhibit. Awards were given to collec- 
tions from schools in the counties of Orange, Escambia, and Volusia, 
also for work from Palatka, and from both colored and white schools in 
Jacksonville and St. Augustine, and to the county normal, De Land, the 
Normal and Industrial College at Tallahassee, and to the office of State 
superintendent of schools. St. Joseph’s Academy, at St. Augustine, 
was also awarded a medal. 
CATHOLIC SCHOOLS. 
Catholic schools were the only ones, or chief ones, which exhibited 
from several States. From Alabama, three Catholic schools received 
awards; from Louisiana, Soulé’s Commercial College, New Orleans, 
received an award, otherwise the awards were given to Catholic insti- 
tutions of learning, of which 11 were located in New Orleans; from 
Mississippi, only Catholic schools exhibited, and received 7 awards, 3 
of these being located at Natchez; from Tennessee, only the Ashe Art 
School, Memphis, Central Tennessee College, Nashville, under Meth- 
odist auspices, and St. Patrick’s school, received awards, and notably 
the Christian Brothers College, Memphis, whose very worthy president, 
Brother Maurelian, was director of the Catholic exhibit; from Texas 
only Catholic schools exhibited, and 3 received awards; and from 
Vermont only Catholic instruction was exhibited, and St. Joseph’s 
Academy received an award. 
ATLANTA UNIVERSITY. 
This institution, conducted for the benefit of colored people, and 
aided by the American Missionary Association, takes its name from 
Atlanta, Ga., where it is located. Visitors and the board of judges 
agreed in their opinion of the great merits of the work done by it.
-P-A-G-E-1147
EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1137 
The exhibit gave ample evidence of good training, furnished in letters, 
inthe sciences, and in handiwork. Moral and spiritual aims pervade 
every department of the institution. 
THE FREEDMEN’S AID SOCIETY OF THE METHODIST EPISCOPAL 
‘ CHURCH. 
[Rev. J. C. Hartsell, secretary.] 
This society, with the some forty schools and colleges under its super- 
vision, about half of them devoted to colored education, exhibited work 
from Ceutral College, Nashville, Tenn., and from Claflin University, 
South Carolina, and received for the same deserved recognition by the 
board of judges. The exhibit included the students’ work in the sey- — 
eral literary and scientific subjects taught, and specimens in manual 
training. The whole gave good evidence of the great work carried on 
by the society, and left no doubt of the capacity of the colored youth 
to receive education in both lines. It was unfortunate for those who 
came to the great exhibition to get a just view of the education now 
furnished in the country to a race who were so recently slaves that 
more of the education offered them both by public and private means 
was not represented. This great side of American education was too 
nearly left out of view. : 
HAMPTON INSTITUTE. ~ 
The exhibit from this institute, located at Hampton, Va., recalled its 
phenomenal history. It receives for the benefit of its colored students 
from Virginia a portion of that State’s national grant in aid of agri- 
culture, but is mostly sustained by benevolent friends. For a consider- 
_ able time it has received Indians as well as negroes. Its methods with 
Indians are much the same as those at Carlisle, Pa. (which see). The 
exhibit fitly contained a portrait of Gen. S. C. Armstrong, made by one 
of the students. Its work with the negroes from the first has been most 
satisfactory. Its attendance is large and not limited to Virginia, and 
its students have gone out to all parts of the South. Great pains have 
been taken to follow them, whether Indians or negroes, and the results 
are most conclusive of the good work done. General Armstrong was 
the son of a missionary to the Hawaiian Islands, and grew up amid 
opportunities of seeing how a degraded people is to be elevated. He 
was a graduate of Williams College and an officer, and gained his rank 
in the Union Army. He was ready to be guided not by untried theo- 
ries, but by the facts he encountered, by the condition of those whom 
he sought to educate. Hewas an enthusiast of a high order. His wis- 
dom won approval by its practical results, both from those who favored 
and those who opposed the education of the colored people. The insti- 
tution receives both sexes, and combines study with work by the hand. 
The greatest emphasis is placed upon moral training. The exhibition 
was one of extreme credit, and received hearty commendation from the 
board of judges, and from the hands of those who examined it.

1138 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93, 
MONTANA AND UTAH, 
This new State and this old Territory illustrate how school systems 
grow up in our Territories and become a fixed part of the administra- 
tion of each State as it enters the Union. Each is aided by great 
| land grants from the General Government, encouraging and requiring 
public instruction, graded from the first steps in learning up to the last 
work of the university, modified especially to meet the great demands 
of the agricultural and mechanical industries. Nowhere else are Com- 
monwealths started with such an outfit; and these exhibits are evidence 
that there may be found in each localities and people that enter fully 
into the appreciation of the opportunities offered them. Their school 
law, administration, architecture, books, teachers, and the work of their 
pupils sometimes will not be found behind the best in the land. One 
is amazed to notice so often evidences of the knowledge of the best 
principles and methods shown in the most distant and out-of-the-way 
places. It may be fairly claimed that this result is largely due to the 
United States Bureau of Education, which communicates with all alike, 
wherever located, bringing each into the great educational family and 
sending to each the information it gains from all. 
CALIFORNIA. 
The educational exhibit of California was separated from the main 
body of exhibits in the Liberal Arts Building; the State concentrated 
its efforts in several departments in the California Building. This was 
an imitation of one of the old missions found in the country when taken 
possession of by the United States. The building was unique and 
added to the variety and historic interest of the collection of State 
buildings, and furnished an excellent opportunity for the installation of 
the characteristic products of the State, and maps and pictures and a 
variety of objects telling the story of its marvelous growth, especially 
since the “gold fever” of ’49, presenting views of its interesting vale, 
mountain, and water scenery, of its various productive agricultural 
lands, its vast vineyards, its noted ranches, its luxuriant orchards of 
orange, lemon, and other semitropical fruits, not omitting its giant trees. 
There were striking representations of the marvelous growth of its 
cities, and attractive pictures of its palatial homes and beautiful villas. 
Here and there pictures of its public institutions showed the quality 
of utility, combined with impressive architecture; a great variety of 
statistics was well set forth, and a large amount of valuable litera- 
ture was distributed. In the midst of this great State display the 
philosophical student was not satisfied either with the opportunity 
offered for the display of education or with the extent to which the 
schools and higher institutions of instruction participated in it. These 
agencies, holding their causative relation to all other conditions in 
the State, were not adequately present in any representation. There
-P-A-G-E-1149
  
  EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1139 
were, however, educational collections of merit as recognized both by 
easual visitors and the experts of the board of judges. 
An award was given to the public schools of Oakland, San Jose, 
Temescal, San Diego, St. James, Pasadena, Santa Barbara County, 
he Coggswell Polytechnic College, and the Golden Gate Kindergarten 
of San Francisco, and a large number of Catholic institutions. 
To estimate correctly the wisdom and value of the educational efforts 
in the State, there should be kept in mind the motives and conditions 
of its settlement—the varied sources of its population. The early rush 
of settlers was not for the purpose of finding relief from oppression or 
tofounda great model State, but to get gain, to gather gold, with little 
thought beyond; but in this condition of affairs there were those who 
had other thoughts, who sought to lay foundations deep, broad, and 
sure for the social, civil, and religious institutions of liberty. They 
builded in the midst of overwhelming difficulties. They builded well. 
In connection with educational beginnings no name is more desery- 
edly conspicuous than that of John Swett, a native of New Hamp- 
shire, a born teacher, and favored with the best training.in principles 
and methods. Hewas among the first teachers on the Coast, and with 
his legal friend has to be eredited with the draft of the first school law 
enacted, which has operated ever since so efficiently in the establish- 
ment of schools and in promoting the intelligence and virtue of the 
. people of the State. Its points of excellence and their results are most 
instructive. 
Hon. J. W. Anderson, superintendent of public instruction, reports 
a school population of 293,897 between the ages of 5 and 17 years for 
the year 1892. Of these 213,359 attended public schools, 21,001 were 
in private schools, and 59,537 did not attend any school during the 
year. There is in the State a compulsory attendance law, and in expla- 
nation of these absences the State superintendent observes that many 
of those absent are between the ages of 5 and 6 years; others are 
employed at home; others are detained by ill health; some by prefer- 
ence are not started to school until 7 or 8, and some taught at home. 
Itis interesting to note that of the children enumerated by the census 
1,835 were negroes, 1,361 were Indians, and 1,364 were Chinese. 
Subordinate to the State supervision there is supervision of instrue- 
tion in the cities and larger towns, and county supervision in the 
rural sections of the State; 2,191 districts maintain schools over eight 
months, 30 districts less than six months. 
Of the 258,095 pupils enrolled in public schools, 170,683 were in pri- 
mary classes, 61,391 in grammar classes, and 6,021 in high schools. Of 
the 5,891 teachers employed 1,222 are males and 4,669 females. The 
average salary paid to female teachers is $66.12 per month, and to male. 
teachers $82.96. Of the teachers 4,721 subscribe for some educational 
journal, and 1,134 are graduates of California State normal schools and 
382 of other normal schools. The total valuation of school property is  
-P-A-G-E-1150
1140 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
reported to be $15,193,996. Of this $355,780 is in school apparatus, 
$637,438 in school libraries, and $14,200,778 in sites, houses, and furni- 
ture. The total annual expenditure is given as $5,351,891.32, of which 
$608,229.27 were paid for sites, buildings, and furniture, and the balance 
for apparatus, libraries, salaries, and contingent expenses. The State 
report for 1891-92 does not contain either the reports of the normal 
schools or that of the State University, which crowns the system of pub- 
lic instruction in the State. The teachers’ institutes are an interesting 
feature of the school work of the State. The State superintendent 
reports having personally visited the teachers’ institutes in 36 different 
counties, and that of the 5,991 teachers employed there were reported 
in attendance upon teachers’ institutes 5,609. 
The city of San Francisco, by far the largest in the State, in the 
report for 1894 shows a school census population of 68,390, a total valua- 
tion of school property of $5,063,363.85, a total annual expenditure of 
$889,009.32, a total enrollment of 44,349 youth, of whom 1,230 were in 
the two high schools, 571 in the commercial high school, 38,262 in the 
grammar so and 4,286 in the evening schools. 
Hon. John Swett, the veteran educator, in closing his four years’ 
administration as city superintendent of schools, remarked: 
Ihave done = utmost to secure some method of appointing teachers better than 
that of personal favoritism or of political spoils. 
In taking leave of the 900 teachers of the school department, some of whom have 
been my personal friends and coworkers for many years, and nearly one-half of 
whom were my pupils in the girls’ high and normal schools, I do so with regret, as 
my retirement from office, in all probability, marks the end of my life work in teach- 
ing and in school supervision. 
I wish also in |closing this report to return my sincere thanks to the people of 
this city for their long-continued kindness to me, both in prosperity and adversity. 
Forty years ago I came here a young man, friendless and unknown. I secured an 
humble position as a teacher. Here I have devoted my youth, my manhood, and my 
advancing years to the public schools. : 
As teacher, as State superintendent of public instruction, as city superintendent 
of public schools, I have put into my work all my enthusiasm and all my energy. 
I love the city of my adoption. I am proud of herschools. I havea profound faith 
that a good system of public schools is essential to the preservation of good govern- 
ment. The public schools must be made the nurseries of intelligent patriotism. 
They must be jealously guarded against attack, and must be kept in line with the 
best of modern thought in education. 
Iam thankful that it has been my privilege to aid in laying the foundation of the 
public school system of this city and of the State of California.   
The kindergarten display of California was a special object of attrac- 
tion. The prominence of the kindergarten on the Pacific Coast is due 
especially to Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper, the president of the Golden Gate 
Kindergarten Association, under whose auspices nearly half a million 
of dollars have been bestowed, by private beneficence, upon this 
supremely important feature of education in San Francisco. 
Mrs. Cooper is a lady of rare native ability, of unusually scholarly 
attainments, an eloquent speaker, whose life is consecrated to the 
x

service of others. Her efforts for the uplifting of all conditions and 
classes of society accord with Christian principles and methods. She 
has received no compensation for her continued and untiring efforts 
in the promotion of kindergarten training. Her reports are prized , 
wherever there is interest in this important subject. She teaches a 
Bible class which has sometimes reached an attendance of 700, and 
has been a most important auxiliary in her great labors. 
Some incidents in the introduction of the kindergarten to the Pacific 
Coast are worthy of note. The call reached the East for a kindergar- 
ten on this coast. By the aid of the Bureau of Education Miss Emma 
Marwedale, a lady of German descent, peculiarly devoted to child train- 
ing, responded. Prof. Felix Adler, in an address in San Francisco, 
deeply impressed the importance of kindergarten. Miss Kate Smith, 
now the well-known authoress Mrs. Kate Wiggin, received training 
from Miss Marwedale, and began teaching kindergarten in San Fran- 
cisco, perfecting herself in kindergarten methods by improving other 
opportunities. Her sister, Miss Nora Smith, joined her in these efforts, . 
and has continued in this important service. Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper, 
who was employed many years by the United States Bureau of Edu- 
cation as its agent in securing information on the Coast, visited one of 
these kindergartens, and at sight apprehended its revelation of possi- 
bilities of good for the child, and immediately began her efforts in this 
behalf, which have been crowned with unparalleled results. Miss 
Hattie Cooper is her secretary and special assistant. 
This exhibit at Chicago consisted of large books of work beautifully 
bound, the hand work of little children. The photographs of over 
3,000 children were taken in groups, the different nationalities being 
strongly brought out, including the American, Irish, Spanish, Italian, 
Scandinavian, and African races. Children possessing striking char- 
acteristics were taken separately. It was constantly remarked by 
visitors who saw these pictures that California children seemed to be 
both healthy and handsome. All these pictures were tastefully framed 
and lettered, indicating the different schools, ages of children, ete. 
These are the Stanford, Hearst, Helping Hand, Lux Potter, Lester 
Norris, Pacific, Pope, Emily P. Walker, Hazel Montgomery, Willard, 
Enily Faithful, Two Friends, Potrero, Lulu Shattuck, Pearl Dowda, 
Joseph Rosenberg, William N. Steuben, Sarah H. Congdon, Osgood 
and Grace, Produce Exchange, Merchants’, Insurance, Attorneys’, Real 
Estate, Mayfield, and Menlo Park kindergartens—thirty-eight in all in 
which there have been enrolled 18,126 children. 
Over 3,000 children are thus grouped, and California will have good 
reason to be proud of the healthy, hearty, intelligent-looking little folks 
at the World’s Columbian Exposition. Miss Martha Philip, an ama- 
teur photographer of fine taste, has been taking these pictures for sey- 
eral months. She has worked con amore, as is evident from beautiful 
and artistic work. The interiors of some of the kindergartens are

exceedingly well done, notably the Lester Norris and Stanford Memorial 
kindergartens. 
Two exquisite circular charts, very large in size, designed by Miss 
Anna M. Stovall, the trainer of the Golden Gate Normal School, have 
ealled forth warm encomiums from art connoisseurs for their artistic 
beauty and originality of design. One is called “The Love Chart,” 
and illustrates the mother love, beginning with the animal creation 
and rising in its development until it reaches all that is highest and 
best in human life. The other is a “Time Chart,” representing the 
divisions of time for daily work and rest, unfolding into the larger 
divisions of weeks and months, the completed circle expanding into 
yarious seasons, which have been beautifully illuminated and illus- 
trated by the artistic hand of Miss Helen T. Bacon, a teacher of the 
Golden Gate Association, whose fine talent is well known in San 
Francisco. 
In addition to this there are several thousand copies of the Thir- 
teenth Annual Report—a World’s Fair edition—together with a like 
number of a handsome pamphlet entitled Symmetrical Outlines of 
Development and Training. This latter is a valuable work, especially 
prepared for the Golden Gate Association by Prof. C. H. McGrew, 
president of the Summer School of Methods of San Jose. These con- 
stitute a valuable feature of the exhibit. Jn 
The exhibit of the Catholic schools of California was to be found in 
the Catholic school exhibit in the Liberal Arts Building. The Catholic 
societies which planted the early missions in the region, when the ter- 
ritory became a part of the United States retained their lands and 
properties, and in some cases these turned out of great value, and have 
furnished them large means for prosecuting with efficiency their educa- 
tional work. The dignitaries of the church and the teachers and pupils, 
appreciating the opportunity, took a great interest in preparing for the 
exhibition. 
The success of their efforts is evidenced by the attention their sev- 
eral collections commanded at the exhibition and the large number of 
awards bestowed by the judges. All grades of instruction, from the 
kindergarten to the university, were represented. The variety was 
very great, both in hand work and in letters. The girls showed great 
skill, especially with the needle; some of the embroidery was exquisite. 
OREGON. 
There was no little surprise at the merit of the educational exhibit 
from Oregon. Oregon is less visited and less known outside of its own 
borders than California. Not a few Americans and many foreigners 
did not anticipate evidences of so promising educational work from a 
State about which they knew so little. Its alcove in the Liberal Arts 
Building was well filled. The early management of its educational lands 
and funds did not preserve them in their integrity, and the benefits

EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1143 
now derived from these sources are not so large as the age of the State 
might lead one to expect. It has, however, the university, the agri- 
cultural college, and the common schools, aided by the national grants. 
As the mistakes of the past are noted, not a few will recall the efforts 
of Rey. George Atkinson, D. D., and others to have them corrected. 
The exhibit, as in so many other cases, was prepared in no small degree 
by the sacrifice and enterprise of leading educators, teachers, and their 
friends. 
The effort to secure the exhibit began as early as December, 1891, 
and was under the direction ofa committee of which I. W. Pratt, 
superintendent of schools of Portland, was chairman, and Prof. D. J. 
Hawthorn, of the State University, was secretary. Its preparation had 
a wholesome, stimulating, and patriotic effect upon the schools. As 
might be expected, Portland led with its 200 teachers and 20,000 
children. The excellence of its high school building attracted special 
attention. Considerable slate work was photographed and much ob- 
served. The collections from Salem, Ashland, Albany, Astoria, Jack- 
sonville, and Eugene did their teachers and pupils great credit, giving 
good evidence of the qualification of teachers and the faithful efforts of 
pupils. There were good drawings, good penmanship, and good speci- 
mens in the various other subjects taught. The college of agriculture, 
the State University crowning the public system of education, and the 
university at Willamette, under Methodist auspices, illustrated what is 
done for higher education in the State. It was unfortunate for the 
early history of Oregon that the office of the superintendent of schools 
was joined with that of the governor at the first and so remained 
until 1873. Since these duties have been intrusted to a separate officer 
the progress of education has been much more satisfactory.   
      
WASHINGTON. 
This is one of the States more recently admitted into the Union. Its 
educational exhibit was in its own unique building, and did not come 
under the attention of the board of judges until near the close of the 
Exposition. A visitor who entered the building, so as first to gain an 
idea of the educational collections, and thus to have in mind as he 
advanced the foundations so laid for the intelligence of the people of 
the State who are to enter into the possession of its great natural 
advantages, was quite ready to foretell for it a great future. Unfortu- 
nately, under Territorial management the first university grant in a 
sense disappeared, but by the generosity of the National Government 
Washington has come in as a State for the usual patrimony of land 
grants for educational purposes. The judges gave awards for the 
schools of Tacoma, Spokane, Pullman, Olympia, and Seattle. The 
award to the State office specified general excellence of work, meluding 
good exhibits from rural districts; valuable statistical charts and meri- 
torious classification. The exhibit consisted of drawings and other 
   
-P-A-G-E-1154
; < ¥

pupils’ work from all grades; also charts and maps in geography, 
bird’s-eye view maps, photographs showing physical culture, exercises, 
and buildings; specimens of soap carving, clay models, work in science, 
and statistical charts. 
EDUCATION AND THE GOVERNMENT EXHIBIT. 
The building in which the Government exhibit was installed had a 
floor space of 157,500 square feet and in the galleries 33,500 square 
feet, or a total of 191,000 square feet of floor space. There were added 
four auxiliary structures, specially adapted to the exhibits of the 
Naval Observatory, the United States Army Medical Department, and 
of the Weather Bureau, and Indian Bureau, respectively. 
Against the opposition of not a few the Government of the United 
States has taken part as a separate agency in a series of exhibitions. 
Some of these opponents may ask, What has the Government exhibit 
to do with education? The reply should be made known in all its 
borders, that its exhibit should educate the people in what the Govern- 
ment is and what it does, that they may understand it and love it, 
and be ready intelligently to defend it from force within and without. 
The person who has traveled in this country and foreign lands can not 
fail to observe how much more is done by governments there than here 
to entertain the people and make them familiar with its beneficences. 
In international exhibitions other forms of government, such as imperial 
and monarchial, are brought in direct comparison with ours. Repub- 
lican government in a sense is put on trial. Can it do this better than 
other forms of government? Is it more intelligent or honest? Does 
it serve the people better? Are they under it more free, intelligent, 
orderly, and happy? Courtesy may not allow these questions to be 
asked audibly in our presence, but are they not natural and likely to 
be revolving in the mind of every thoughtful visitor? In this view 
any infelicity in the action of Congress which makes a law not adapted 
to its purpose, or any act on the part of the administration of the 
exhibit which defeats its best operation—its attainment of the end in 
view—becomes a ground for preferring other forms of government in 
which the people have less participation. 
France did not participate in the scheme of awards at Chicago. This 
led to many criticisms upon that Republic, when in fact on closer inquiry 
it may turn out to be due to the whim of a particular commissioner. It 
would be the part ot wisdom if errors either in legislation or adminis- 
stration in any exhibition by a government could be pointed out for its 
avoidance. 
One thing which crippled the result of this Government exhibit 
should not be forgotten. No other building containing exhibits afford- 
ing lessons on subjects at once so important, so varied, or so numerous 
gave out so few explanatory documents. This is said to be due not to   
 
-P-A-G-E-1155
EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1145 
the officers in charge of the Government exhibit, but to the rules 
imposed upon them by the general management of the Columbian 
Exhibition. 
In no other building was the logic of arrangement so excellent. Sev-_ 
eral of the departments, by pictures and various presentations, carried 
the thought of the observer through there in their history from the 
foundation of the Government to the present time. Never had so many 
of our citizens the opportunity of such object lessons in our history. 
Here were the Presidents and Cabinet officers and others who had con- 
tributed to the happiness of our people, the growth and form of our 
institutions, and the glory of our flag in peace and in war. How small 
were the beginnings! How vast and mighty the results! - 
The State Department told the story of our relations to other gov- 
ernments; the Treasury, of our finances and of the work of the several 
great bureaus under its direction; the War and Navy, of ox Wrepae 
tions for internal and external defense; the Department of Justice 
recalled the system of courts by which even-handed justice is meted 
out through the land, crowned by the Supreme Court of the United 
States, than which there is no superior among the nations of the earth ; 
the Department of Agriculture disclosed the aid the Government seeks 
to afford the great body of people directly interested in the tilling of 
the soil. What a revelation was made of the application of science 
to their various interests! The Post-Office Department, to which Presi- 
dent Grant was fond of pointing as a great educator of the people, 
illustrated its beneficent methods of handling their communications 
with each other, whether in regions near or remote, barren or produc- 
tive, semitropical or arctic, by a post-office in actual operation, and by 
a still exhibit of its appliances for transportation by land and water, in 
cars, steamships, on horseback, or by dog trains, or on the back of the 
weary messenger; the Interior Department’ told the story of lands and 
patents—but the Commissioner of Patents did not allow that exhibit 
of the inventive genius of the country to be submitted to the examina- 
tion of the board of judges—of the Indians, railroads, and of various 
beneficent institutions in the District of Columbia; and of the census 
of the people, and of the condition of the several Territories reporting 
to it; and of the Bureau of Education, by far the most influential office 
of education in the world. How manifest.everywhere the results of 
science in all its forms. 
Clearly here might the visitor say, ‘‘ Here is the vanguard of the 
world’s welfare.” Looking to the exhibits of governments extremely 
monarchial in form, you find the presence of science in its most 
advanced results; but it is there in the naval and military service or 
civil service for the efficiency of that service, and with little or no refer- 
ence to its dissemination among the people for their enlightenment and 
comfort; whereas science is made to do its best for our Government 
service in different forms—it is everywhere compelled to have constant 
     
   
-P-A-G-E-1156
1146 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
direct reference to the people; everywhere its progress and all its infor- 
mation are reported to them and made subservient to their demands, 
to their progress and happiness in untold forms and ways. How many 
bureaus are the very embodiments of the agencies which keep scientific 
research on the alert and at the front in lines beyond numeration. 
Here especially the Smithsonian, that great institution for the dissemina- 
tion of knowledge among mankind, is present in most effective form. 
In no exhibition on the ground is the space more crowded; old and 
young, in every condition that can move about by themselves or by the 
aid of others and observe, crowd each other in eager inspection of the 
numerous objects of natural history and human conditions. The whole 
is arranged with due regard to two great fundamental conditions of 
instruction—the historical and comparative. Here is the origin, here 
are the several steps of progress, and here are the opportunities for com- 
parison. The collections of the Smithsonian and the National Museum 
are united. Fortunately they are under the direction of Dr. G, Brown 
Goode, who brings to their organization and installation the experience 
of so many exhibitions. In the department of arts and industries there 
were various subdivisions in the collections: Fisheries, naval models, 
including the Sallie Constant and the Mayflower, animal products, fishes 
and textiles, foods, musical instruments, costumes, ceramics, historical 
collections, graphic arts (Professor Roose, a German expert, declares 
this collection unique, and says probably it stands alone in the world), 
materia medica, department of ethnology, prehistoric anthropology, 
oriental antiquities, religious ceremonials, American aboriginal pottery, 
department of mammals, of birds, birds’ eggs, reptiles, etc.; fishes, 
vertebrate fossils, mollusks, insects, marine invertebrates, comparative 
anatomy, including homologies, general and special, such as the 
mounted skeleton of the man and horse, the skull and teeth of the ~ 
horse, domestic; numerous composition of the human body, and this on 
to the end, of which even the instructive enumeration is here impossible. 
The whole was so distinctly labeled as to make it especially intelligible. 
How much teachers of the country carried away for use in schools no 
one can tell. No one can examine this vast exhibit without feeling 
how faithfully the purpose of the founder of the Smithsonian is being 
earried out. The colonial collections and the representatives of condi- 
tions of life in the other. American Republics added greatly to the 
interest of the building. 
The Indian Office illustrated its school work among the Indians in a 
building specially prepared for the purpose. Here representatives of 
different Indian schools, teachers and pupils, followed each other in 
illustrating their school exercises in daily operation; here were also 
many articles connected with Indian life. 
The small space assigned to the Bureau of Education was the center 
of educational study by experts in education, both American and for- 
eign. Here were its publications, reports, annual and special, its cir-    
-P-A-G-E-1157
    EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1147 
culars of information, and bulletins, covering all phases of education in 
all quarters of the globe, giving in the form of statistical tables graphic 
and descriptive text, together with articles by the ablest writers on 
education. Here was information for the student of education to be 
found nowhere else in the exhibition; showing the office to be a veri- 
table educational exchange for the special benefit of the United States 
indeed; while drawing its information so largely from the United 
States, it also gathers all of value from other lands, and is responsive 
to the inquiries of all visitors. By the aid of the American Library 
Association, represented by Melvil Dewey, A. M., of Albany, N. Y., 
secretary of the board of regents for that State and State librarian, 
the library as an educational agency, supplemental and helpful, to all 
instructive, was very fully represented. Here was a model library of 
5,000 volumes, installed in the modern stack system of shelves; here 
was library architecture, furniture, binding, indexing, cataloguing, and 
administration complete, together with a person in charge to answer 
inquiries, Secondary schools were represented by photographs, cata- 
logues, and reports; colleges and universities were shown by photo- 
graphs and catalogues; educational periodicals in great variety; school 
architectures, exteriors and interiors; in school furniture, specimens and 
models showing its growth; sehool apparatus, etc., including models 
for illustrating complete methods; school superintendents, as set forth 
in State and local reports; the school, as seen in operation in photo- 
graphs; school savings banks, documents illustrating their methods and 
progress; time schedules, including mechanical appliance used in the 
University of Kansas in arranging hours for recitations, lectures, ete. 
The Alaska public schools, which have been under the Bureau from 
the first as organized by Rev. Sheldon Jackson, D. D., appointed by the 
Commissioner and approved by the Secretary of the Interior, general 
agent for education in Alaska, were shown by photographs of grounds, 
buildings, and pupils, and by a variety of specimens of pupils’ work. 
This is a unique feature of the working influence of the Bureau, From 
the acquisition of that distant territory the United States were pledged 
by solemn treaty to provide for the natives the privileges enjoyed by 
our citizens. In the annual report of the Bureau for 1870 attention 
was called to the fact that nothing substantial had been done to dis- 
charge these obligations. Year after year attention was called in the 
annual report to this great neglect. 
Even the enterprise of American missionaries did not enter the Ter- 
ritory. Dr. Sheldon Jackson, a most heroic minister of the Presby- 
terian Church, had advertised in vain for some one to enter the field 
until he secured Mrs. McFarland, who had been in the Indian service, 
and he led the way and located her as teacher at Fort Wrangel. Con- 
gress was long heedless of all appeals for legislation until Hon. Ben- 
jamin Harrison entered the Senate, and as a member of the Committee 
on Territories took up the subject, and secured the passage of a bill giv-
-P-A-G-E-1158
  1148 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
ing alimited form of Territorial government to that neglected country. 
Under this legislation schools were authorized, and their organization 
and management have been directed by this Bureau. Fortunately no 
wars have occurred with the natives, nor has the policy of feediag on 
the reservations been adopted, which, misapplied, has so delayed the 
development of American aborigines elsewhere. Schools as initiative 
of Government action are likely not only to save the native population 
from destruction, but to make them an element of intelligence and 
strength and the means of producing wealth. 
The whole educational exhibit has been made more attractive to 
visitors by the courteous explanations of Mr. Parks, the attendant in 
charge. No visitor, unless he carefully examine the publications of the 
Bureau, would suspect the influence the Hon. W. T. Harris, its Com- 
missioner, has had upon all others either of educational congresses or 
educational collections in the Columbian Exposition. In his office and 
at his hand were the addresses of all the educational systems, State 
and city institutions, of every grade in the United States; nay, more, 
all the chief educational agencies, ministries, and institutions in the 
world over. Little has been said of how active and earnest his efforts 
have been to secure proper attention to the exhibition of education, to 
assure it proper space, to secure for it the proper consideration of edu- 
eators in this and other countries by letters and circulars, and by the 
approval of such measures as the celebration of Columbus Day, pro- 
moted so efficiently by the Youth’s Companion newspaper. 
SOME SPECIAL EXHIBITS. 
THE BUSINESS EDUCATION EXHIBIT. - 
In this exhibit a good number of the best business colleges in the 
country united and sought to make an ideal presentation of their work. 
Speaking of it Professor Soule said: “The combined exhibit is insti- 
tuted upon a grander scale than was ever undertaken before by business 
colleges, and it is made in such a liberal and catholic spirit by those 
engaged therein as will bring honor to their names and as will redound 
to the good of practical education, and to all business schools indis- 
eriminately.” The object of the exhibit has been declared to be to 
show the results of what is known as business education; first, to 
exhibit the original work as shown in the still form, and next to exhibit 
the living product in the educated student himself, as shown in the 
active form. The original work consists mainly of books of accounts, 
where are shown the records of business transactions written by the 
student, together with the papers and correspondence pertaining to the 
same, as also the phonographic outlines of matter taken from dictation 
with typewritten transcription set off. In addition to this, some of the 
schools have very properly presented written lessons in English and 
carefully arranged mathematical solutions. In the active exhibit the 
real boys and girls are at work there in their attainments, the product

of the schools. Some of them are keeping Boole reall books—contain- 
ing the records of real transactions; others are making out bills of 
purchase and writing letters—real bills and real letters—pertaining 
to real business that is occurring daily with the same regularity and 
fullness of detail that distinguishes business everywhere. Dr. Selim 
_ Peabody, chief of department of liberal arts, has said the exhibit being 
collective has no competitor, and I may be permitted to say that it is 
unique, comprehensive, complete, and, for every reason, admirable. It 
illustrates the excellent results which may be secured in a collective 
exhibit, using time, money, and skill to the best advantage. 
INSTRUCTION IN HOME BUILDING. 
A happy thought came to the social economical science committee of 
the Women’s Auxiliary of Philadelphia when the association decided 
to erect on the exhibition grounds at Chicago a workingman’s house as 
a model for the study of visitors. 
Every American is interested that his country should be a land of 
homes. The late census made an investigation never before made into 
farm and home proprietorship in the several States and Territories. 
The condition of the family is the measure of civilization. If society 
is to advance, the solitary must be set apart in families. The heart 
delights to think that there is no place like home. The home fills a 
large place in all progressive civilization. How often it is the theme 
of poetry. Says Thompson: 
Home is the resort 
Of love, of joy, of peace, and plenty; where 
Supporting and supported, polished friends 
And dear relations mingle into bliss. 
The ladies of Philadelphia, in carrying out their plan, attempted 
nothing fanciful. Philadelphia, noted as a city of homes, furnished 
them the model. : 
The house was built in brick, and was an exact counterpart of many 
occupied by the workingmen of their city. There was no attempt at 
palatial conditions, and while utility and health were consulted at 
every turn, there was careful regard for taste. The ground and eleva- 
tion plans were prepared and could be obtained by those who sought 
them. : 
How vast this interest is may be judged by the investigations of the 
last census. 
Of the 12,690,152 families in the whole country 47.80 per cent own 
their farms and homes and 52.20 per cent hire; and of the families 
owning their farms and homes 27.97 per cent have incumbrance thereon 
and 72.03 per cent no incumbrance. Among 100 families, on the aver- 
age, 52 hire their farms and homes, 35 own free of incumbrance, and 13 
own subject to incumbrance. The number of resident owners of land 
in the United States is 6,066,417 plus such a number of landowners as 
may be living in tenant families. 
 
-P-A-G-E-1160
  1150 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
The farm families number 4,767,179, of which 65.92 per cent own their 
farms and 34.08 per cent hire, while of the owning families 28.22 per cent 
have ineumbranee on their farms and 71.78 per cent have none. In 
1880 25.56 per cent of the farms were hired. Among 100farm families, 
on the average, 34 hire their farms, 47 own free of ineumbrance, and 19 
own subject to incumbrance. 
The results for the 7,922,973 home families are that 36.90 per cent own 
their homes and 63.10 per cent hire them, while of the owning fam- 
ilies 27.70 per cent own their homes subject to incumbrance and 72.30 
per cent free. One hundred home families on the average contain 63 
that hire their homes, 27 that own free of incumbrance, and 10 that own 
subject to incumbrance. 
The cities and towns of 8,000 to 100,000 population are aggregated 
for the 1,749,579 home families that live in them, and of these families 
35.96 per cent own their homes and 64.04 per cent hire, while of the 
owning families 34.11 per cent own subject to incumbrance and 65.89 
per cent without ineumbrance. In 100 home families, on the average, 
64 hire their homes, 24 own free of incumbrance, and 12 own subjeet to 
incumbranee. 
In the cities that contain over 100,000 population there are 1,948,834 
home families, of which 22.83 per cent own their homes and 77.17 per 
cent hire, while of the owning families 37.80 per cent own subject to 
ineumbrance, and 62.20 per cent free of incumbrance. In 100 home 
families in these cities, on the average, 77 hire their homes, 14 own free 
of incumbrance, and 9 own under ineumbrance. 
EXHIBIT OF THE BARON DE HIRSCIL TRADE SCHOOLS, 
These schools bear the name of the well-known philanthropist. The 
object of the schools is to teach Jewish boys and men who have arrived 
from Russia and Roumania such trades as are likely to afford them a 
living—not to make them finished mechanics, for that would require 
too much time, but to impart to them sufficient knowledge to make 
them “handy men” in shops, where they can continue their education, 
and eventually become master workmen in their employments. The 
fund supplies them with money, when necessary, to enter trades unions, 
so as not to in any manner conflict with organized labor. 
The exhibit contained specimens in carpentry, ironwork, house and 
sign painting, turning, carving, artistic metal work, electroplating, 
plumbing, and gas fitting. 
Those who attend the day classes and have no means of support are 
boarded by the fund and are required to attend the evening English 
classes. The course of studies oceupy from four to six months, accord- 
ing to ability and the nature of the work done by the pupils, and they 
are placed in shops, to become self-supporting. Large numbers have 
already found a ready welcome in some of the best shops in New York 
and elsewhere. ‘Transportation, when needed, is given to them by the

fund, and they thus become mechanics, with an honorable living nearly 
always assured them. 
Inquiries can be addressed to general agent of the fund A. 8. Solo- 
mons, 45 Broadway, New York City. 
EDUCATION OF THE DEFECTIVE CLASSES, FEEBLE-MINDED, DEAF, AND BLIND, 
Several countries exhibited some of the work done in education for 
the defective classes, but no foreign country showed the evidences of 
progress furnished from the United States. Elsewhere, in the main, 
the education of these classes has been treated as a charity and left to 
the uncertainties of private efforts. In America, the institutions for 
their benefit were early, unfortunately, called asylums, but wisely their 
administration was made one of public concern and of publie expense 
—became a part of public provision for education, from which none are 
to be excluded and in which all are to share according to their ability. 
These exhibits were both collective and by institutions. In the collec- 
tive exhibit for the deaf 25 institutions participated and in that for 
the blind 9 were represented, offering admirable opportunities for 
eritical study. Here were plans of grounds, exterior and interior 
views of buildings, descriptions of administration, specimens of appli- 
ances, especially of the most improved, together with the work of 
students in great variety, both in letters and in manual training. It 
was a delight to see how education has been made to introduce these 
unfortunate classes into so large a share of the life of those given 
normal powers of mind, or speech, hearing, or sight. “What hath 
God wrought!” Their lives need no longer be so apart from others, so 
restricted in occupation, enjoyment, and growth, or so great a burden 
to others. If dependent on themselves, they have the means of self- 
support and comfort. They may share in the current intellectual, 
moral, and spiritual life of others. The Brailie inventions, originated 
in the Illinois institutions for the blind, have added greatly to their 
facilities in the use of letters both for purposes of printing and writing. 
The library for the biind, printed at Louisville, Ky., at the expense 
of a fund provided by a grant from the United States Treasury, and 
distributed pro rata to each Congressional district in the nation, is a 
provision for their intelligence as beneficent as it is beautiful. The Dr. 
Moon (of England) system for the home learning and reading of the 
blind is also doing great service. Many are familiar with the work so 
efficient in all the departments, but especially accomplishing so great 
results in music in the Royal’ Normai College for the Blind, Westow 
street, Upper Norwood, S. E., London, England, founded and con- 
ducted by Prof. F. J. Campbell, Ph. D., a native of Tennessee, United 
States, himself blind. The work for the deaf and dumb was fitly 
crowned by the exhibit of Gallaudet College, located at Kendall Green, 
Washington, D. C., a national college of excellent standards, and the 
only institution of this grade of instruction for the deaf in the world,
-P-A-G-E-1162
    1152 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
founded and conducted at national expense under E. M. Gallaudet, 
LL. D., president. The exhibit also reminded the observer of the intro- 
duction of deaf-mute instruction into our country by theelder Gallaudet. 
The exhibit of 75 volumes of the volta bureau, sustained by the munifi- 
cence of Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone, and under 
the direction of Hon. John Hitts, illustrated the good work it is doing. 
The improvements in teaching visible speech were specially illustrated 
in the school under Miss M. C. Gowen. (Which see.) 
THE EXHIBIT OF THE ALLIANCE ISRAKLITE UNIVERSELLE. 
This exhibit was in care of Joseph Biefeld, of Chicago, and was sent 
from the central office in Paris in care of the New York branch, of 
which A. 8S. Solomons, 45 Broadway, New York, is president. The 
exhibit showed something of the work of pupils and the plans and 
literature of the society. 
In 1860 this philantrophic organization was formed at Paris, and 
to-day it numbers 40,000 members, of every nation, united in a central 
committee that meets at Paris. In addition, it has two cooperative 
societies that work upon the same plan and may be practically called a 
part of the main organization—the Anglo-Jewish Association of Eng- 
land, and the Israelitische Allianz of Vienna. 
It is emphatically a benevolent society in the broader sense, having 
no political or religious bearing in any direct way. It aims to promote 
the emancipation and moral progress of the Jewish people in countries 
where they are still denied civil and religious liberty, and extends aid 
to those who suffer socially and politically by reason of their being 
Jews. As stated in its original address, the alliance is to defend the 
honor of Judaism whenever attacked, to encourage labor and useful 
trades and professions, to fight against ignorance and vice due to base- 
less prejudice, to promote by peaceful means the emancipation of 
brethren still oppressed by exceptional legislation, and to perfect gen- 
eral freedom by intellectual and moral regeneration. 
Its work for the past thirty-two years has been steadily in the line 
thus prefigured. It has avoided religious discussion and political 
interference. It has endeavored to raise the standing of oppressed 
Israel wherever located, by making them, in sympathy with the nations 
with whom they were dwelling, as patriotic as their neighbors, so that 
the mistakes of sectarianism could not be charged against the schools 
that the alliance was developing. In Turkey, the pupils are taught 
the language, history, and geography of Turkey; in Bulgaria and Rou- 
mania, the pupils are taught the history and geography of those coun- 
tries, and in Morocco the pupils of the schools at Tangiers, Tetuan, and. 
Fez rival the Moorish children in their eagerness to be informed about 
the history and development of this ancient domain. While insisting 
on the familiarity of its pupils with the history and genius of Judaism, it 
admonishes them unfailingly to be patriotic; to be French in France,

German in Germany, English in English colonies. Its aim is to level 
the barriers that separate the Jews from other peoples, to make Juda- 
ism a living creed, not a political division. 
Education is thus the sole work of the alliance—teaching the chil- 
dren of the poor and the ignorant in the language and traditions of the 
country of their birth, that they shall not be. strangers within their 
own land, and teaching tolerance to the representatives of authority in 
regions where benighted prejudice and restrictive laws still subject the 
Jews to harsh treatment and grievous wrong. 
As soon as the central committee learns of any act of oppression 
due to the revival of antiquated laws or the enactment of new legisla- 
tion opposed to the spirit of the age, its secretary appeals to the better 
sense of the government through the local press, and tries to reach the 
ears of the leaders of thought and action by timely presentation of 
liberal ideas and argument. The press has been its noblest champion. 
The alliance is recognized for its peaceful humanitarian mission in 
all liberal governments. 
The alliance schools are established along the Mediterranean, spread 
in Turkey and Bulgaria, are to be found in Asia, and are flourishing in 
Morocco. Instead of the narrow and ill-ventilated Talmud Torah, 
these schools are commodious, airy, and under modern methods, with 
teachers trained to give varied instruction. Everywhere the establish- 
ment of these schools has inspired in neighboring classes and sects 
respect for the Jews, and they are used as models for others to follow 
in reorganizing their systems of instruction. 
In addition to the general education of the children, they acquire 
practical knowledge in trades and agriculture; the girls are taught 
housework and needlework. Each school has a library of over 300 
volumes. Inthe Jerusalem school there are six workshops, for uphols- 
tery, tailoring, shoemaking, turning, etc. 
Inthe Jaffa Agricultural School, formed in 1870, the Porte leased 240 
hectares of fine land at a nominal rent, the lease to extend indefinitely, 
So much has this school grown, that a recent report gives a glowing 
description of the state of the buildings, the large products of the farms, 
and the prospects of the pupils. They raise oxen, sheep, horses, mules, 
pigeons, etc. The annual output of oranges is large. Among the 
the pupils are 20 gardeners, 10 winegrowers, and carpenters, tanners, 
and blacksmiths. There are 100 pupils in all, 50 being Russian exiles, 
the rest natives of Turkey and Roumania. 2 leaving the school 
graduates receive a subvention of nearly 1,000 franes. These graduates 
find ready work as directors of other schools and farms in the Hast and 
- in the Argentine. The expenses of the school for this year reach 
98,000 francs. The assured income will not reach 75,000 frances. 
There are reported enrolled in all the schools—boys, 8,888; girls, 
4,445,

SCHOOL SAVINGS BANKS. 
The rapidity with which extreme poverty swells up its victims is one 
of the startling facts in social science. The public school, acting upon 
every child, must be the great public agency for the arrest of this evil. 
If every child can be trained to save, as well as given the knowledge 
and habits which assure his earning, much will be done toward saving 
the very poor from the temptations and sufferings of poverty. School 
savings banks have already yielded excellent results in this direction, 
They have been most extensively adopted in Belgium and France. In 
Belgium,in 1889, there were reported 5,259 of these banks, with 212,037 
depositors, to whom were due $78,213.42. In France there were 
reported in 1887 23,371 savings banks, with 161,387 depositors, to whom 
were due $2,491,229.62. They were introduced into this country by 
J. H. Thiry, esq., when commissioner of the schools of Long Island 
City, N. Y. His efforts from that date have received the approval 
of the United States Bureau of Education and of many of the most 
eminent American educators. It appeared from the data furnished in 
the exhibition that they had been adopted in 78 different districts or 
cities, in which there were reported 33,810 depositors, who had deposited 
$345,643.52. Mr. Thiry acts on the principle that method is the arith- 
metic of success. Mr. A. E. Winship, editor of the Journal of Educa- 
tion, remarks: ‘‘ M. de Molance has been the greatest promoter of school 
savings banks in France. It is found advisable in the elementary 
schools there to have the deposit received at least twice a week, and 
even a daily opportunity is better.” 
It is now thought that the best time to receive deposits is for fifteen 
minutes before the afternoon session daily. In this way not much time 
is required, and some of the fifteen minutes can be used for other 
things. There should be regularity and promptness in the meeting of 
appointments for the receipt of funds. The school savings bank pre- 
vents waste of pennies, prevents the formation of habits of buying 
candies, gum, ete. The influence of the economy is seen in all things, 
even in the care of clothing and school property. There should be no 
emphasis placed upon large deposits; there should be no reports of the 
largest deposits. The aim is to have the principle emphasized. 
The school deposits should go to the regular savings bank at least 
once a week. If this is done on Friday the books will be ready for 
distribution to pupils on Monday. It is a valuable ‘business train- 
ing” for the teacher and is worth all it costs. In France the school 
savings is in every grade, from the lowest primary to the highest. 
The school savings bank tends to prevent pauperism, crime, sickness, 
prodigality, and various vices, and to make children thrifty, orderly, 
frugal, economical, discriminating in each use of money. It has its 
influence upon all phases of economy in time and virtue as well as 
money.

THE PROGRESS AND EXTENT OF TEMPERANCE EDUCATION.! 
During the twelve years prior to the World’s Columbian Exposition 
the school study of physiology and hygiene, with special reference to 
the nature and effects of alcoholic drinks and other narcotics, came into 
great prominence as a preventive measure for the vice of intemperance. 
By. State enactment, as indicated by the above map, it has been made 
a mandatory branch for all pupils in the public schools of 38 of the 44 
States of the United States, and by act of Congress, for all pupils in 
all schools under Federal control, including those in the Territories, 
national, military, and naval academies, and the Indian and colored 
schools. The distinctive feature common to all these laws is the 
emphasis, in connection with the study of physiology and hygiene, 
of the nature and effects of alcoholic drinks and narcotics upon the 
human system. 
The provincial parliaments of the Canadian provinces, either by act 
of parliament or by order of the provincial boards of education, have 
made the same study obligatory in the public schools of the Dominion 
of Canada. 
The Parliament of Sweden has also enacted laws which make scien- 
tific or phvsiological temperance a part of the public education of 
Sweden. 
A large, well graded, and authentic school literature, with methods 
of study founded on modern pedagogical ideas, has been produced, and 
was, with copies of the laws requiring this study, on exhibit at the 
Columbian Exposition. Throughout all Christendom there is a spirit 
of interested inquiry concerning this ‘Educational method for the pre- 
vention of intemperance.” Hence a report of the educational forces 
represented at the Exposition, forces which are destined to influence 
character and shape individual and national destiny, would be incom- 
plete should it omit the temperance educational movement. Therefore 
an examination was ordered of all the pupil work in physiology on 
exhibit, in order that, in so far as that would indicate, an idea might be 
gained of the real progress of the study in the schools of the States 
under this legislation. 
In estimating the following report of this examination it should be 
borne in mind that the States did not in every instance send to the 
Exposition samples of work in all branches pursued in their schools; 
and, as in only a few instances was there any special effort made to 
secure samples of school work in this branch, its absence does not nec- 
essarily imply neglect or indifference. In this report honorable mention 
is given only to papers that show not only a knowledge of structure 
and function, but also a knowledge of the consequences of the violation 
of hygienic law in the use of alcoholic drinks and narcotics. 
1¥or the following extract and careful survey of the progress and extent of temperance education 
as exhibited by Mrs. Mary H. Hunt, I am indebted to Mrs. Susan M, D. Fry, Ph. D., one of the most 
efficiont of the board of judges of department L.

  EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION, t15T 
The pupil work of each State was examined with reference to its 
compliance with the law of that State. As these laws differ in some 
particulars, a brief digest of the law applying is placed before each 
report. The reports of the pupil work in the different States are given 
in the order in which the laws requiring such work were enacted. 
VERMONT. 
The scientific temperance education law was enacted in 1882, with 
strengthening amendments in 1886, requiring physiological temper- 
ance to be taught orally to all pupils in the schools as thoroughly as 
other branches to pupils who are not able to read, with text-books in 
the hands of pupils who are able to read; text-books to give at least 
one-fourth of their space to temperance matter, and those for the high- 
est grade of graded schools at least 20 pages. Examination of teach- 
ers required upon the nature of alcoholic drinks and narcotics and 
their effects upon the human system. Penalty attached for nonen- 
forcement of the law. 
Pupil work.—Pupil work was exhibited from several towns, including 
Cabot and Newfane; this showed positive teachings against alcoholic 
drinks, especially the lighter liquors, and against tobacco. 
MICHIGAN. 
The law was enacted in 1883, with strengthening amendments added. 
in 1886. It requires that instruction shall be given in physiology and 
hygiene, with special reference to the nature of alcohol and narcotics 
and their effects upon the human system, as thoroughly as other 
branches, with text-books that meet the established standard (see fore- 
going map) in the hands of pupils able to read. Examination of 
teachers required; penalty for nonenforcement of law. 
Pupil work,——State normal school.—Physiology as required by law is 
taught in this State normal school and in the normal training schools. 
No student work from this institution on exhibit. 
Public schools.—The late superintendent of public instruction, Hon. 
F. S. Finch, in charge of the exhibit, reports the study universally 
taught as the law requires. Thirteen cities and villages sent pupil 
work. Those from the Quincy schools seemed to be most in harmony 
with the spirit and letter of the law. 
NEW HAMPSHIRE. 
The law was enacted in 1883, making this a mandatory study “in all 
mixed schools and in all graded schools above the primary grade.” 
Teachers receiving certificates must pass an examination on the sub- 
ject. 
Pupil work.—Normal school.—This study is pursued in the State nor- 
mal and training schools. The pupil work exhibited from the seventh 
and eighth grades of the normal training school was largely anatomical. 
 
-P-A-G-E-1168
  1158 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93, 
Public schools.—The public schools, including those of Nashua and 
Portsmouth, exhibited pupil work which was chiefly anatomical, with 
little or no hygiene or any adequate treatment of the nature and effects 
of alcoholic drinks and narcoties. 
NEW YORK. 
The law was enacted in 1884, requiring instruction on this subject to 
be given to all pupils in all schools under State control, and the exami- 
nation of teachers in the same. ‘ 
Pupil work.—Publie schools—The eilucational exhibit of this State 
reports physiological work from 146 cities, towns, and institutions. 
That examined showed descriptions of structural physiology, rather 
than a presentation of the more important subject of hygiene, includ- 
ing the nature and effects of alcoholic drinks and narcotics. 
The fact that there were no text-books ready for the use of pupils in 
all grades when the law in this State was enacted was a great hindrance 
to its prompt enforcement. That so many towns and cities sent in 
exhibits of pupil work is an evidence of an increasing sentiment in favor 
of the complete enforcement of the law in all schools as required. 
Physiology is one of the required studies for the academic credentials 
issued by the State of New York. Examinations for these credentials 
include questions on the effects of alcohol and tobacco. 
RHODE ISLAND. 
The law was enacted in 1884, requiring this study of all pupils in all 
schools. No penalty attached. 
No exhibit of physiology pupil work of any kind at the World’s 
Coluinbian Exposition. 
PENNSYLVANIA. 
The law was enacted in 1885, requiring this study of all pupils in all 
public schools and institutions to be taught as thoroughly as other 
branches. Examination of teachers required; penalty of forfeiture of 
public money for nonenforcement of law. 
Pupil work.—Normal schools.—Seven of the thirteen normal schools 
had exhibits to a limited extent. Only two had physiology exhibits, 
both on purely anetomical subjects. 
Public schools—There was a very general exhibit of pupil work on 
this subject from the public schools of the State. Among these was 
work from the schools of West Chester, Pittsburg, Bryn Mawr, and 
Philadelphia. That from the Newton girls’ combined school of Phila- 
delphia, for skill in anatomical drawings, full and clear description of 
structure and hygiene of the organs described, and for the clear descrip- 
tion of the physical, mental, and moral effects following the use of alco- 
holie drinks, deserves honorable mention. 
The exhibit of pupil work in the fourth grade of the Drexel School 
deserves special commendation for statement of facts concerning the

EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1159 
origin and nature of alcoholic drinks and their effects upon the organs 
described. The language of the papers is natural, showing them to be 
an expression of knowledge and logical understanding on the part of 
the pupils. 
MAINE, 
The temperance education law of Maine was enacted in 1885. It 
requires this study of all pupils in all schools supported by public money, 
with the examination of teachers. 
Pupil work.—Normal schools.—Physiology is taught in the three 
State normal schools. No exhibit of work from any except Farming- 
ton; that chiefly anatomical with a little hygiene, and less reference to 
the effects of alcohol and narcoties. 
State college at Orono is under this law, but had no exhibit. 
Public schools.—Fourteen towns and cities sent manuscript pupil 
work; five of these included the effects of alcohol and narcotics. 
MASSACHUSETTS. 
The law was enacted in 1885. It requires that this study be taught 
to all pupils in all schools, as thoroughly as other branches, and that 
teachers pass an examination on the subject before receiving certificates. 
Penalty attached for nonenforcement of the law. 
Pupil work.—Normal schools.—Five normal schools and the reform 
schools and defective class schools are all included under this law. No 
exhibit of physiology pupil work was made by them. 
Public schools.—Of the manuscript physiology work from this State, 
including the effects of alcoholic drinks and narcotics, the work of the 
sixth grade of the Boston schools, as well as that from the grammar 
grade of the Salem Bentley school, and from the West Boylston high 
school, deserves commendation. The work from the Hyde Park schools 
deserves honorable mention. The course and methods of study there 
adopted, as illustrated by the pupil work, deserve especial mention. 
The facts taught are presented in a manner suited to each grade, and 
the subject receives enlarged treatment from grade to grade. 
ALABAMA, 
The law was enacted in 1885, and was subsequently reinforced by 
strengthening amendments in1891. It requires this study of all pupils 
in all schools, taught as thoroughly as other branches, with text-books 
in the hands of pupils able to read, and examination of teachers. 
There was no exhibit of physiology pupil work. 
WISCONSIN. 
The law was enacted in 1885, requiring this study of all pupils in all 
schools; also the examination of teachers. 
Pupil work.—Normal schools—No pupil work on physiology on 
exhibit from either of the five normal schools.
-P-A-G-E-1170
1160 ' EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Publie schools.—A few anatomical charts were exhibited by some 
high schools. No exhibit of pupil work on hygiene or the effects of 
alcohol and narcotics. 
MISSOURI. 
In 1885 Missouri enacted a permissive temperance education law, but 
required the examination of teachers in physiological temperance. 
Pupil work.—Normal schools.—There was no physiology pupil work 
exhibited by any of the six State normal schools, except the St. 
Louis normal school; the papers from this showed commendable les- 
sons on the effects of alcoholic drinks. 
Public schools.—The physiology exhibit of the Kansas City Central 
high school deserves honorable mention for its intelligent discussion 
of the origin of alcohol through fermentation, and the physical effects 
“ of this beverage. That of the fourth grade of the Humboldt and Jef- 
ferson schools, Kansas City, deserves commendation. 
KANSAS. 
The law was enacted in 1885, requiring this study of all pupils in all 
schools, and also the examination of teachers. 
Pupil work—Normal schools.—The State University, the agricul- 
tural college, and the normal school are under this law, and physio- 
logical temperance is in their courses of study. The normal gives 
twenty weeks in the seventh year to this branch. 
Normal institutes are held in each county four weeks of each year. 
Two or three days are given to the topic of hygiene, including the con- 
sequences of violating hygienic law by the use of alcohol, tobacco, and 
other narcotics. 
Public schools.—Some manuscript pupil work in physiology was exhib- 
ited, all of which included the effects of alcohol and narcotics. 
The superintendent of the exhibit reported that the study is 
thoroughly taught in all the Kansas schools so far as known, and that 
the study is effecting all that could be desired in giving pupils an intel- 
ligent trend toward abstinence from alcoholic drinks and tobacco and 
in favor of obedience to all laws of health. 
NEBRASKA, 
The law was enacted in 1885, requiring this study of all pupils in all 
schools, and the examination of teachers. 
State University. Hygiene is taught in every course of study in this 
institution and is pursued from one to two and a half years. No pupil 
work in physiology exhibited. 
Normal school.—Physiology, including hygiene and the effects of 
alcohol and narcotics, is in the course of study. No exhibit of physiology 
student work.
-P-A-G-E-1171
EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1161 
Public schools.—The county school officials of 49 counties reported 
“ Physiological temperance regularly and systematically taught in the 
public schools.” Twenty counties reported this study taught incident- 
ally. Hight counties reported it not taught at all. Thirteen counties 
made no report. 
Eight towns and cities sent exhibits of pupil work in this branch. 
Two others exhibited pupil work in physiology which was purely ana- 
tomical, with no reference to alcoholic drinks, tobacco, and hygiene. 
The pupil work of the eighth grade in the Pawnee City public 
schools deserves honorable mention. 
OREGON. 
This law was enacted in 1885, requiring that this study be pursued 
by all pupils in all schools. 
Pupil work.—Normal schools.—The University of Oregon and two 
normal schools are under this law. Physiology and hygiene, including 
the effects of narcotics, are in their courses of study. No exhibit of 
student work in this branch was contributed. 
Public schools.—It was reported that this branch is universally 
taught, beginning with the third or fourth grade. <A limited exhibit 
of physiology pupil work showed some treatment of the effect of 
alcohol and narcotics. 
NEVADA. 
The law was enacted in 1885, making this a mandatory study in all 
public schools. 
Public schools.—-No exhibit in physiological temperance.   CONNECTICUT. 
The law was enacted in 1886, but with an amendment requiring this 
study to be taught from.a book prepared by a State board. Little 
or no pursuit of the subject in the schools followed. In 1893 the law 
was amended requiring this study of all pupils in all schools, and that 
it be taught as thoroughly as other branches, with text-books in the 
hands of the pupils. These text-books must devote at least one-fifth 
of their space to temperance teaching for the primary and intermedi- 
ate grades, and at least 20 pages for the highest grade of graded 
schools. Examination of teachers required, with penalty for non- 
enforcement of the law. 
As thislaw was not approved until May 26, 1893, there could be no 
exhibit of pupil work as a result of the amended law. 
Pupil work.—Normal schools.—There are three normal schools and 
one agricultural college that come under this law. No physiology 
student work exhibited by these schools. 
Public schools.—Good work in physiology, but including no reference 
to hygiene or to the effects of alcohol and tobacco upon the human sys-  
-P-A-G-E-1172
  1162 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
tem was exhibited by several schools. The Paweatuck high school 
sent commendable papers showing a good knowledge of the origin, 
nature, and effects of alcoholic drinks and narcotics. 
NATIONAL TEMPERANCE EDUCATION LAW. 
In 1886 the National Congress enacted a law applying to all the 
pupils in all the public schools of the Territories and of the District of 
Columbia, in the Military and Naval Academies, and in Indian and 
colored schools. This law requires that physiological temperance be 
studied by all pupils in schools, and that it be taught as thoroughly as 
other branches, with the use of text-books in the hands of the pupils. 
The examination of teachers for a certificate is required, and a penalty 
for nonenforcement of the law is attached. 
The lack of any extended pupil work following this law is not an 
indication of its nonenforcement in the field to which it applies. 
NEW MEXICO. 
The subject is taught to a limited extent, but evidently not from text- 
books up to the standard. 
UTAH, 
There was a limited exhibit of physiology pupil work from the public 
schools, but it included no adequate treatment of hygiene or the effects 
of alcohol and narcotics. 
INDIAN TERRITORY. 
No exhibit of physiology pupil work. 
ARIZONA. 
No exhibit of physiology pupil work. 
MARYLAND. 
The law was enacted in 1886, and requires that the study be pursued 
by all pupils in all schools with text-books in the hands of pupils able 
to read. Instruction must be as thorough as in other branches. 
Pupil work.—Public schools.—The pupil work exhibited by the Bal- 
timore city grammar schools showed very good instruction, especially 
in the seventh and eighth grades, and that of the seventh grade 
deserves honorable mention. The manuscript sent by the female gram- 
mar school, No. 7, was especially complete and satisfactory. Good work 
was also presented by the colored training school of Baltimore. 
IOWA. 
The law was enacted in 1886, requiring this study of all pupils in all 
schools, and that the subject be taught as thoroughly as other branches; 
also the examination of teachers. Penalty for nonenforcement attached 
to the law.

but they had no exhibit of pupil work in physiology. It was reported 
that temperance physiology is taught. 
Public schools Manuscript and chart work on scientific temperance 
was exhibited by 13 towns and cities. That from the Oscaloosa schools 
deserves commendation; and that from the fifth, sixth, seventh, and 
eighth grades of the West Des Moines schools deserves honorable

The law was enacted in 1887, requiring this study of all pupils in all 
schools, and also the examination of teachers. No physiology pupil 
work was exhibited. 
WEST VIRGINIA. 
The law, enacted in 1887, requires that this subject be taught all 
pupils in all schools as thoroughly as other branches. Examination 
of teachers required. Penalty for nonenforcement attached to the law. 
Pupil work.—Normal schools.—There are six normal schools, none of 
which exhibit any physiology pupil work. 
Public schools—The primary and grammar grades showed very good 
instruction in anatomy and hygiene; but the papers examined gaye 
little attention to the effects of aléohol and narcotics. 
The superintendent in charge of the exhibit reported that excellent 
work is done in the public schools throughout the State, but that the 
papers on exhibit were not gathered with reference _ scientifie temper- 
ance instruction.

The law, enacted in 1887, requires this study of all pupils in all 
schools to be taught as thoroughly as other branches, with text-books 
in the hands of pupils able to read; penalty for nonenforcement. 
Pupil work.—Normal school.—This institution has physiology in its 
course of study, but no pupil work except charts and anatomical draw- 
ings was exhibited. 
Public schools.—The State superintendent of public instruction, in 
charge of the exhibit, reported that the result of such faithful teach- 
ings of scientific temperance as he had observed was all that the most 
sanguine friends of the movement could desire in creating an intelli- 
gent aversion for alcoholic drinks and narcotics. 
MINNESOTA. 
The law was enacted in 1887, and requires this study of all pupils in 
all schools, also the examination of teachers; penalty attached for non- 
enforcement of the law.

Pupil work.—Normal schools.—Physiology is taught in the four normal 
schools, but they sent no exhibit of student work in this branch. 
Publie schools.—The pupil work exhibited by the high schools shows 
a good knowledge of anatomy, but seems to indicate that the text- 
books used are old ones, not yet brought up to date, for only the 
“habitual” and “excessive” use of alcohol is condemned.

prize essays on the subject of narcotics. There was no pupil work on 
this subject in the normal exhibits. 
Public schools—Of the pupil work in physiology exhibited by the 
schools of this State, that from the Lincoln school of Oakland showed 
the most practical comprehension of the subject from the standpoint of

of alcoholic drinks. 
LOUISIANA. 
The law was enacted in 1888, requiring the study of all pupils in all 
schools, with text-books in the hands of pupils able to read. These 
books must devote at least one-fourth of their space to temperance 
matter, and at least 20 pages for those used in the highest grade of 
graded schools. The subject must be taught as thoroughly as other 
branches; teachers examined; penalty for nonenforcement attached. 
No exhibit of pupil work in temperance physiology.

The law, enacted in 1888, requires that this study be pursued by all 
pupils in all schools, and that teachers be examined in it before receiy- 
ing certificates. Penalty attached for violation of the law. 
Pupil work.—There was no exhibit of pupil work, except that from 
the Cleveland high school, which was entirely lacking in any mention 
of the effects of alcohol and narcotics, and that from the Mount Sterling 
school, which was only fair. The papers presented moral rather than 
scientific reasons for total abstinence.

The law was enacted in 1889. It requires this study of all pupils in 
all schools. Examination of teachers is required. 
Pupil work.—Normal schools.—These schools presented no physiology 
student work. 
Public schools.—A number of schools sent pupil work which showed 
that the subject was taught, and that in the lower grades the instruc- 
tion was good.

ILLINOIS. 
The law was enacted in 1889, making this a mandatory study in pub- 
lic schools and requiring the examination of teachers. 
Pupil work.—Normal schools—The University of Illinois comes 
within the provisions of this law, and the exhibitors reported that 
physiology is extensively taught. 
The State Normal University gives physiology a place in its curricu- 
lum. The exhibit showed good anatomical work, but there was no 
treatment of hygiene or the effects of alcohol and narcotics. The 
Southern Illinois State University also showed in its exhibit little 
attention paid to hygiene and the nature and effects of alcohol and 
narcotics. 
Public schools.—There were exhibits of physiology pupil work from 
Chicago, Rock Island, Nashville, Springfield, La Salle, Kewanee, and 
trom Pulaski and Clark counties. All of them contained more or less 
reference to the nature and effects of alcohol and narcotics. In the 
Chicago schools there is no instruction in this branch below the eighth 
grade. 
MONTANA. 
Being a Territory in 1886, Montana came under the national temper- 
ance education law then enacted. The Pathfinder Physiologies were 
in 1889 adopted for six years, and are consequently now in use. 
Pupil work.—Public schools.—Many towns and cities sent manuscript 
work in temperance physiology. That from the third grade of the 
Helena schools showed excellent training. The papers sent by the 
fifth grade of the Marysville schools indicated that the subject of 
hygiene and the effects of narcotics had been faithfully studied, and 
the work deserves commendation, while that from the ninth grade of 
the same school should receive honorable mention.   
NORTH DAKOTA. 
The law, enacted in 1890, requires this study of all pupils in all schools, 
to be taught as thoroughly as other branches, with text-books in the 
hands of pupils able to read. These text-books must meet the required 
standard (see map); penalty attached for nonenforcement of the law. 
Examination of teachers is required. 
Pupil work.—There was an exhibit of high school pupil work in 
physiology, which, however, consisted chiefly of technical anatomy. 
SOUTH DAKOTA. 
The law was enacted in 1890, and requires the study of all pupils in 
all schools to be taught as thoroughly as other branches, with text- 
books in the hands of pupils able to read. These books must meet the 
established standard (see map), and teachers must pass an examina- 
tion on the subject. Penalty attached for violation of the law. 
 
-P-A-G-E-1176
1166 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Pupil work.—Normal schools.—It was reported that these schools 
have physiology in their course of study, and the pupil work exhibited 
by the Madison Normal School showed that the subjects of hygiene and 
narcotics received attention. 
Public schools.—The county superintendent, in charge of the exhibit, 
reported very satisfactory results arising from the thorough teaching 
given in this study throughout the State. There are, according to his 
report, 26,732 pupils pursuing the subject with text-books. The manu- 
script pupil work showed a thorough knowledge of the nature and 
effects of alcohol and narcotics; and the exhibit of pupil work, as a 
whole, deserves honorable mention. 
WASHINGTON. 
The law, enacted in 1890, makes physiological temperance a manda- 
tory study, and attaches a penalty for nonenforcement. 
Pupil work.—Normal schools.—There was no student work exhibited 
from either of the two recently established normal schools. 
Public schools.—There was a very commendable exhibit of anatom- 
ical drawings done in pencil, ink, and crayon, which gave especial prom- 
inence to the results of violating hygienic laws in tbe use of alcoholic 
drinks and tobacco. Those from the Pullman schools, showing the 
effects of alcohol and tobacco upon the pulse, and the effect of alcohol 
~ upon the brain, merit special commendation. The manuscript work in 
the sixth grade of the Olympia schools deserves honorable mention for 
its presentation of the effects of alcoholic drinks and narcotics. 
NORTH CAROLINA. 
The law was enacted in 1891, and requires that this study be taught all 
pupils in.all schools as thoroughly as other branches, with text-books in 
the hands of pupils who are able to read. These books must meet the 
established standard (see map). Examination of teachers is required 
and a penalty for nonenforcement of the law is attached. No exhibit 
of physiology pupil work. 
MISSISSIPPI. 
The law was enacted in 1892, making this a mandatory study, to be 
taught in the same manner and as thoroughly as other branches. Ex- 
amination of teachers required. No exhibit of physiology pupil work. 
KENTUCKY. 
The law was enacted in 1893, and requires this study of all pupils ia 
all schools, with instruction as thorough as that in other branches. 
As this law was not signed by the governor until after the Exposi- 
tion was opened, there could be no exhibit of physiology pupil work 
coming under this law. 
TEXAS, 
The law was enacted in 1893. It requires this study of all pupils in 
all schools, and aiso the examination of teachers. As this law was not
-P-A-G-E-1177

approved until after the opening of the Exposition, no work under the 
law could be presented. 
ARKANSAS. 
This State has no temperance education law. Some physiology work 
was on exhibition, but contained no reference to the power and effects 
of alcohol and narcotics. 
INDIANA. 
This State has no temperance education law. The course of study 
in the Indiana Institution for Deaf-Mutes contains physiology in the 
academic year. 
NEW JERSEY. 
  This State has no temperance education law. 
Pupil work.—Normal school.—lIt was reported that the Trenton nor- ' 
mal school has the subject of the “Effects of narcotics” taught by a 
specialist in the regular course. é 
Public schools.—The Jersey City high school exhibited superior ana- 
tomical work by the pupils. There were several very commendable 
charts illustrating the effect of alcohol upon the stomach and liver. 
In the Atlantic County schools, as shown by the pupil work, the sub- 
jects of hygiene and the effects of alcohol and narcotics are well taught 
in all grades. The primary grades showed especially good work. The 
effect of aleohol on the organs of the body was illustrated and described 
in superior pupil work from the Westwood school, and deserves hon- 
orable mention. 
CATHOLIC COLLEGES AND SCHOOLS OF THE UNITED STATES. 
Many colleges and many of the higher grade schools exhibited work 
in technical physiology, in which there was a comparatively small 
amount of hygiene, and in only a few instances was reference made to 
the effects of alcohol and narcotics. A very commendable outline of 
the various phases of the subject, under the head of “Alcoholic drinks 
and narcotics,” was exhibited in a paper by Thomas J. Murphy, of 
Manhattan College, New York City. Unfortunately this was not 
exemplified in the material exhibited. There seemed to be, in these 
schools, a need of more treatment of the nature of alcoholic drinks and 
of the power of a little alcohol to create an appetite.   SUMMARY. 
Three of the 38 States having temperance education laws made no 
educational exhibit whatever. Of the remaining 35 States, the laws of : 
Kentucky, Texas, and the amended law of Connecticut did not go into | 
effect until after the opening of the Exposition, hence they could make , 
no exhibit of work as a result of the law. Connecticut, however, fur- 
nished some commendable papers showing a good, comprehensive 
knowledge of the subject.
-P-A-G-E-1178
    1168 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Seven of the remaining 32 States did not include physiology and 
hygiene in their exhibit, viz: Rhode Island, Alabama, Nevada, Dela- 
ware, Louisiana, North Carolina, and Mississippi; and 2 of the 4 Ter- 
ritories, Arizona and Indian, made no exhibit of physiology pupil work. 
This, however, does not indicate that the subject is not taught, as 
schools made their own choice of what they would send. 
There were, then, 25 States under special temperance laws, not includ- 
ing Connecticut, that showed temperance physiology in their exhibits 
at the World’s Columbian Exposition. Of these, it appears from the 
foregoing report, more than one-third presented work of such excel- 
lence, showing an intelligent knowledge of physiology and hygiene, 
and of the effects of alcohol and narcotics upon the human system as 
to merit special commendation or honorable mention, viz: Pennsyl- 
vania, Massachusetts, Missouri, Nebraska, Maryland, Iowa, Montana, 
South Dakota, and Washington. 
Of the States not having a temperance education law, New Jersey 
showed such superior pupil work on the subject of hygiene and the 
effects of alcohol and narcotics as to merit honorable mention. 
A number of institutions and some States having no temperance 
physiology, or but little, on exhibition were reported by the superin- 
tendent of public instruction or other officials to have the study well 
taught and according to the conditions of the law—notably, Michigan, 
Kansas, Oregon, West Virginia, and Colorado. 
In view of the fact that the subject-matter to be taught in this branch 
was new not only to pupils, but to teachers, and that the school litera- 
ture had to be written and methods of study to be devised after the 
first laws were enacted, the entire exhibit of pupil work in temperance 
physiology at the World’s Columbian Exposition was most encouraging. 
The testimony of those in charge of exhibits from the various States 
who are in sympathy with this branch, and therefore have been watch- 
ing its progress in different vicinities, is that the study is not only 
making an impression upon the minds of the pupils in favor of total 
abstinence from alcoholic liquors and narcotics and in favor of hygienic 
living, but that it is strongly influencing the habits of the children 
and through them reaching the homes so widely that it is sure to 
shape the future of the nation. 
IL.— EXHIBITS FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 
ENGLAND, SCOTLAND, IRELAND, AND WALES. 
There was no adequate exhibition of public education under group 
149 from England, Scotland, Ireland, or Wales. This deficiency was 
in no small measure made up by a statement from J. G. Fitch, Her 
Majesty’s chief inspector of schools, and furnished to visitors at Chi- 
_cago. There could be no better authority. He said, England differs 
from most European countries and from America in having been very

late to accept on the part of the State any responsibility for providing 
the means of public education. It can not be said even yet to possess 
a coherent and symmetrical system, such; for example, as that which 
the forethought of Swiss and German statesmen, of John Knox in 
Scotland, or of the founders of the New England States created for 
maintaining a sufficient supply of schools. Its present educational 
position has been attained by slow degrees and by means of numerous 
experiments and compromises. Until the middle of the present cen- 
tury the only institutions which had existed for public education were 
endowed or foundation schools, and schools established voluntarily by 
societies or private benefactors. The earlier endowed schools date from 
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and a small number from the four- 
teenth century, and had for their main purposes the teaching of Latin 
and Greek—then the chief, if not the only, accessible instruments of 
intellectual culture—and the preparation, of scholars for the ancient 
universities. Another large group of endowed schools, dating chiefly 
from the beginning of the eighteenth century, had for their chief object 
the education of the poor in the elements of knowledge and in the 
“ principles of the Established Church.” Under the name of parochial, 
or charity schools, endowed foundations of this type continued until 
recent times to furnish gratuitous instruction of a humble kind, and 
often to provide clothing and apprenticeship. In the beginning of the 
present century Dr. Andrew Bell and Joseph Lancaster aroused by 
their personal efforts considerable enthusiasm on behalf of popular edu- 
cation, and became the founders of two great societies, the National 
Society for the Education of the Poor in connection with the Established 
Church, and the British and Foreign School Society, which was com- 
posed of persons of various Christian denominations, but which sought 
to make the school instruction scriptural but nonsectarian. Both soci- 
eties achieved large success in inducing local committees in all parts of 
the country to establish and maintain elementary schools. In 1839, 
when, at the instance of Lord Lansdowne, Lord Brougham, and Lord 
John Russell the first grants were made by Parliament in aid of public 
education, it was through the agency of these two societies that those 
grants were made. A committee of privy council was then formed to 
administer such funds as might from time to time be intrusted to it by 
Parliament, and in 1846 appeared the first minutes of council, framed 
largely by Sir James Shuttleworth, the secretary of the department. 
These minutes established a system of public inspection, provided for 
the training ana certification of teachers, and defined the conditions 
under which public aid should be dispensed to the schools. 
Until the year 1870, however, the State made no provision for the 
establishment of new schools, but simply confined its action to the 
administration of grants in aid of such schools as were founded or man- 
aged by the two societies and other voluntary or religious bodies. In _ 
that year the elementary education act recognized for the first time the 
ED 93——74

duty of the State to provide for all her children the means of instrue- 
tion. It proceeded on the assumption that the voluntary system existed, 
and ought to be maintained ‘and encouraged, but that it needed to be 
supplemented by other provisions wherever it proved to be deficient. 
It enacted, therefore, that in those places school boards should be elected 
by the ratepayers, and should be charged with the duty of erecting and 
maintaining such schools as were needed to make the supply of instrue- 
tion—computed as accommodation for 1 in 6 of the whole population— 
complete. The act of 1870 further enjoined that in all aided schools, 
denominational and undenominational alike, parents who objected to 
any form of religious teaching or worship might withdraw their chil- 
dren from such teaching without losing any of the other benefits of 
the school. It was also enacted that in all schools provided by local 
boards, and aided by rates, no catechism or religious formula distinet- 
ive of any particular denomination should be used. The education 
department was empowered to administer public aid impartially to all 
public day schools which fulfilled the required conditions as to the 
qualifications and number of the staff, the suitableness of the buildings, 
and the quality of the secular instruction, but was not charged with 
the minor duty of inquiving into or regulating the religious instruction, 
which was in all cases to be given in such part of the day as to leave 
for every meeting of the school two hours of unbroken secular teaching. 
Other provisions of the education act empowered school boards to frame 
local by-laws compelling the attendance of children at school, and sub- 
sequent acts have created school attendance committees to exercise 
this power wherever boards do not exist. There is now in every part 
of the country a local authority which, by means of its officers, enforces 
the attendance of children between the ages of 5 and 14, except those 
partially or wholly exempted for labor, by passing the standard exam- 
ination appropriate to their age. 
These measures have proved very effective for their purpose. In 
1870, the year of the passage of the education act, there were in 
England and Wales 9,563 voluntary schools receiving Government aid 
and inspection, with a total of 1,152,389 scholars, and 12,467 certified 
teachers. The Parliamentary grant amounted to £464,943, The report 
of the education department for the year 1891-92 shows that there are 
now 4,846,891 scholars on the registers, and 3,749,956 in average attend- 
ance in day schools and 51,974 in evening schools; the total number of 
certified teachers has risen to 47,823, that of assistants to 23,508, of 
pupil teachers to 28,131, and of students in training colleges to 3,310. 
Of the large additional school accommodation thus provided during 
the last twenty years, the school boards, in the exercise of their statu- 
tory powers, have furnished places for about 2,000,000 scholars, and the 
zeal of the friends of voluntary schools about 1,750,000. There is now 
ample accommodation in public elementary schools for 5,500,000 chil- 
dren, or for considerably more than one-sixth of the entire population. 
 
-P-A-G-E-1181
  
EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. aa: 
The funds by which these schools are maintained in efficiency were, 
until recently, derived from three sources: (1) The Parliamentary, 
grant, amounting to £3,434,759; (2) local contributions, either in the 
form of rates to board schools or subscriptions to voluntary schools, 
and (3) the fees paid by parents, amounting to about £2,000,000. But 
in 1891 the assisted education act transferred this last charge, or nearly 
the whole of it, from the parents to the imperial revenue, and gave to 
all children the right to gratuitous education. Itmay now be roughly 
estimated that of the total annual cost of elementary education in 
England and Wales (£7,813,706) nearly £5,500,000 will be paid out of 
the public funds by the central department, £1,500,000 by the local 
rates, and nearly £800,000, or about one-tenth of the whole, by volun- 
tary contributions. The figures for Scotland, which has a separate 
education department of its own, show similar general result. There 
are in the primary schools of that country 680,580 children, or more 
than 1 in 6 of the entire population, of whom an average of 540,028 
are in daily attendance. 
The administration of the English education department is intrusted 
mainly to the vice-president of the privy council. Of those who have 
‘held this office since its establishment in 1856 the most conspicuous 
and influential have been Mr. Robert Lowe, afterwards Lord Sherbrooke, 
who introduced the system of assessing the amount of the grant by 
the efficiency of the school as’ tested by examination; Mr. W. E. 
Forster, the author of the education act of 1870; Mr, A. J. Mundella, 
who in 1881 greatly improved the educational provisions of the code, 
and, in particular, did much to encourage the adoption of the methods 
of Froebel and Pestalozzi in the infant schools; and Sir Hart-Dyke, 
under whose administration was passed the assisted education act. 
It is also to the last mentioned of these statesmen that is to be 
credited an important new experiment in respect of the training of 
teachers. The Government has long assisted by large annual grants 
the normal colleges—44 in number—in which school masters and mis- 
tresses are trained for their special work. But these institutions do 
not supply the whole annual demand for trained teachers, and accord- 
ingly the universities of the United Kingdom and the numerous pro- 
vincial colleges of university rank, which have of late been founded in 
the principal towns, have been invited to cooperate with the depart- 
ment by attaching to them normal classes for the special professional 
training of such students as desire to become elementary teachers. In 
this way the supply of persons who have received a liberal education, 
and who have also been specially trained in the art of teaching, will be 
greatly increased. 
It will thus be seen that the whole of the provision for elementary 
education is now aided and controlled by the State. But hitherto no 
public aid or supervision has been extended in England to secondary 
education. The provision of secondary and intermediate schools con-

sists mainly (1) of endowed foundations, usually called grammar schools; 
(2) of proprietary schools established by societies, companies, or other 
local bodies, and (3) of private schools. Of these, the schools of the 
first class only can be regarded as in any sense within the purview of 
the Government; for the charity commission, which is a permanent 
department of the State, is intrusted with the power of framing schemes 
4 for the government of all endowed schools and of determining their 
| educational character. 
Many recent facts in our history, however, indicate that the sphere 
of public influence over secondary instruction is widening, and is 
likely to be further enlarged. In Wales an intermediate education 
act (1889) is already operating beneficially in coordinating the work of 
the secondary schools. In Scotland the influence of the education 
department has extended to institutions considerably above the rank 
of elementary schools. The local taxation act of 1890 for England — 
and Wales set free a large annual sum derived from liquor licenses 
and placed it at the disposal of county councils for the promotion of 
technical and secondary instruction. At present a large portion of 
this sum is being expended in encouraging such forms of science teach- 
ing and of handicraft as have a more direct bearing on the local indus- 
tries; but much of it will doubtless become available for other forms 
of advanced education. Treasury grants have recently been made to 
provincial colleges in the largest industrial centers. A select commit- 
tee of the House of Commons has recommended the enactment of a 
measure for the registration and better qualification of secondary teach- 
ers, and a bill empowering municipal bodies to establish, with the aid 
of local rates, secondary schools wherever they may be needed was 
framed and introduced into the late Parliament by Mr. Arthur Acland, 
the new vice-president of the council. 
Among the questions still under consideration, and on which Parlia- 
thent and the public will probably ere long express a decisive opinion, 
are: (1) The enlargement of the powers of the education department 
under a responsible minister of public instruction, so as to bring into 
harmony the various agencies for primary, secondary, and university 
instruction, at the same time leaving large scope for local effort and 
initiative, for varied types of schools, and for the liberty of teaching; 
(2) the provision of such links between all institutions for public 
instruction as may enable scholars of promise to proceed from the 
elementary to the secondary school and thence to the university; (3) 
better provision for the professional training of secondary teachers, 
analogous to that which has proved so valuable in the department of 
elementary instruction; (4) such publicity respecting the aims and 
successes of secondary and higher schools as may enable parents to 
know their condition and to choose what will suit them best; (5) the 
tight place of manual and industrial training and of practical and 
experimental science in the scheme of general education, and the rela-

tion in which such training ought to stand to the traditional discipline 
in languages and to intellectual culture generally; (6) the best means 
of enlisting the cooperation of local and academic bodies with the 
Government in the maintenance of a high ideal standard of education, 
and in it improvement from year to year. 
The science and art department, South Kensington, London, SW., 
exhibited examples of drawing, painting, modeling and design exe- 
cuted by art students in the National Art Schools, South Kensington, 
London, and in other schools of art in the United Kingdom, showing 
the principal stages of art instruction under the department of science’ 
and art. : 
D. J. Cunningham, M. D., Trinity College, University of Dublin, 
exhibited a selection from a series of models prepared with a view of 
showing the topographical relations of the brain in man and the apes; 
models of the cerebral hemispheres of an adult woman, a new born 
child, a chimpanzee, and an orang-outang, removed from the cranial 
cavity; models illustrative of the anatomy of the fully flexed elbow joint. 
The examination schools, Oxford, exhibited books, papers, photo- 
graphs, and drawings illustrative of the history and methods of the 
university extension system. 
The school board for London exhibited specimens of work done by 
pupils in the schools in writing, map drawing, designing in colors and 
in colored papers, modeling in ¢ardboard and in clay, woodwork, iron- 
work, brasswork, needlework, kindergarten hand work, laundry work; 
specimens of school materials and appliances, including books, pictures, 
diagrams, scientific and other apparatus, school museum; models, plans, 
and elevations (exhibited by T. J. Bailey, architect) of schools and class 
rooms; regulations, reports. 
There was perhaps enough in these exhibits to turn the thoughtful 
visitor to the examination of the results already attained by public 
education in England, and interest him in the history of the heroic 
struggle by which these results have been secured. 
WOMAN’S EDUCATION. . 
Woman’s education in these countries, especially her training in art 
and industry, was more fully brought out by the efforts of the lady 
managers. It was recalled that it was a picture by Lady Butler, 
painted when she was Miss Elizabeth Thompson, which led Mr. Ruskin 
to retract the dictum he had laid down, that no woman could ever com- 
pose and paint a picture. 
| Nor was it forgotten that we read in Boswell’s life of Johnson:   Johnson was in sach good spirits that everything seemed to please him as we 
drove along. Our conversation turned on a variety of subjects. He thought por- 
trait painting an improper employment for a woman: “ Public practice of any art,” 
he observed, ‘‘ and staring in men’s faces is very indelicate in a female.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-1184
  1174 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Tt was ‘desired, too, that visitors should “keep in mind that Sidney 
Smith, writing in 1810, remarked: 
That at that time, owing to the very low standard of education among women 
and the absence of any kind of encouragement to them to undertake intellectual 
exertion, there was hardly a single work, either of reason or imagination, written 
by a woman in English literature, and that scarcely one woman even had crept into 
the ranks of the minor poets. 
The object of the woman’s committee, as stated by Mrs. Fawcet, was 
to collect such a series of exhibits as would form within certain limits 
a fair representation of English women’s work in various fields of 
activity. The selection admitted no work in which men _ shared. 
Woman’s work was divided roughly into two heads: (1) Occupations 
that have been in the hands of women from time immemorial; (2) occu- 
pations in which women have taken an active part only within com- 
paratively modern times. 
The distinction is perhaps more apparent than real, because the same 
spirit that has caused women to enter upon new fields of activity has 
also caused them to do their old work with such a greatly increased 
knowledge and thoroughness as to invest it practically with new life. 
There is as great difference between the Mrs. Gamp of half a century 
ago and the trained nurse of to-day; between the governess of half a 
century ago—who taught all the arts and sciences as well as oe 
and the use of the globes—and the high scheol teacher of to day, a 
there is between Mrs, Squeers, with ler daily administration of in 
stone and treacle and the woman doctor of to-day. It is not merely 
that new employments have been introduced, but that the old have been 
made new by the new spirit breathed into them. The departments of 
womaw’s work were selected and assigned as follows: 
Lace.—Her Grace the Duchess of Abercorn. 
Embroidery and needlework,—Lady Henry Grovenor. 
Handicrafts.—Lady Roberts. 
Artistic designs in vestibule.—Mrs. Robert Austen. 
Scottish and Lrish domestic industries.—The Countess of Aberdeen. 
Welsh domestic industries.—The Lady Aberdare. 
Literature.—Mrs. Gordon, 
Nursing and hygiene—Mrs. Bedford Fenwick. 
Philanthropic work.—The Baroness Burdett-Coutts. 
Education, including medical.—Mrs. Fawcet. 
The subsection nursing is one in which English women take especial 
pride. They believe the work of their countrywomen in this depart- 
ment to be first in point of excellence, as it was, under the able guid- 
ance of Miss Florence Nightingale, first in point of time. <A very 
eomplete collection was provided in this subsection of every kind of 
appliance and-contrivance used in nursing. 
Mrs. Fawcet observes: 
The last quarter of a century has witnessed a complete change in the aims and 
methods of education for women and girls in the United Kingdom. University edu-
-P-A-G-E-1185

cation has been placed within the reach of women all over England, Scotland, and 
Ireland, and large numbers of women have availed themselves of it and have shown 
not only by their educational honors, but by their subsequent work in a great variety 
of directions, that the labor of cultivation has not been applied to an ungrateful soil. 
During the same period a corresponding change and improvement has taken place in 
the educational work done in girls’ schools. It is probably no exaggeration to say 
that there is not a girls’ school in the United Kingdom that has not benefited by it. 
The exhibits sent by the girls’ school company afford an illustration of the lines 
upon which the education of girls is now conducted. 
One part of the exhibit calls for special remark and explanation, The long row 
of beautiful children whose mothers have had a university education has the motto 
appended to it: ‘‘Non Anggli sed angeli.” This intended to reassure the timid and 
to remind them that for 1,300 years the beauty of English children has passed into a 
proverb; so far, it has not been injured by educating their mothers. Experience, as 
far as it has gone, justifies the belief that education is not one of the things that 
hari distinctive womanhood. 
From England there were exhibits from eight colleges, viz, Girton, 
Newnham, Cambridge; Somerville and Lady Margaret Halls, Oxford; 
Royal Holloway College, Surrey; University College, Nottingham; 
West Field College and Bedford College, London. Girton sent archi- 
tect’s drawing of the college buildings, students’ rooms, views of the 
college, and pottery found in the garden at Girton. Medical education 
was illustrated by representations from the new hospital for women; 
from the Royal Free Hospital, where women medical students receive 
clinical instruction; London School of Medicine for Women, and from 
Clapham Maternity Hospital. 
Among the schools especially represented were the North London 
Collegiate School for Girls, one of the earliest public schools in Eng- 
land for girls, and upon which high schools were in a degree modeled. 
From Ireland there were exhibited official representations of the edu- 
cational systems for both sexes. It is not generally known. that the 
system of public education dates back to 1834-35, when there was 
enrolled 1.8 per cent of the population, which in 1890 had increased to 
828,520, or 17.6 per cent of the population, when the expenditures 
reached $4,729,082, Thesystem is administered by a board of commis- 
sioners, in which there is no participation by local agencies, there being 
no local boards elected as in England or Scotland. The commis- 
sioners are appointed by the Lord Lieutenant for Ireland. The man- 
agers of the schools are generally clergymen. At the outset it was 
declared to be a system of education from which should be banished 
even the suspicion of proselytism, and which, admitting children of all 
religious persuasions, should not interfere with the peculiar tenets of 
any. Religious instruction was specially remitted to the clergy of the 
respective denominations. A system of model or graded schools has 
been introduced, of which there are 29, including 3 in Dublin. These 
schools now enroll about 10,000 pupils. Convent and monastery schools 
have an attendance of 65,548, There came into operation, under the 
poor law of 1840, workhouse schools, which are now attended by 9,434 
pupils; there ave also 52 evening schools, with an average attendance

of 1,747. Of the total of 11,119 classified teachers, 5,621 were women 
and 5,498 men. In the cities the schools of the Christian Brothers are 
numerous. Indeed, it was declared in Parliament in 1892 that the 
Christian Brothers had practically the education of the whole Irish 
city population in their hands, for their schools were situated in all the 
chief centers of population. Since 1878 limited Government aid has 
been bestowed upon secondary education; 244 schools are now said to 
share in this aid. Trinity College, University of Dublin, the earliest 
institution for superior instruction in Ireland, was chartered by Queen 
Elizabeth, and Roman Catholics were excluded until 1793, when they 
were permitted to take degrees and all tests were abolished except in 
the faculty of theology. The college of the Catholic University was 
founded in 1854. 
In 1849 the so-called Queen’s colleges were established in Cork, Bel- 
fast, and Galway. In 1879 the Royal University was created, whose 
examinations for degrees are open to all candidates, including women. 
According to the census in 1881, 25.2 per cent of the population were 
illiterate, which was reduced in 1891 to 18.4 per cent. During the same 
decade it may be noted that there was a decrease of 15.7 per cent in 
the number of children under 15 years of age. This decrease reaches 
19 per cent among children 1 to 5 years of age. A writer remarks 
that “this decrease is not due to immigration alone, but is the proof of 
a check in the normal increase of the population.” It should not be 
forgotten that the science and art department maintains in Dublin a 
very useful institution known as the Royal College of Science. Of the 
colleges founded by women for women participating in the exhibition, 
there were Alexandra College, Dublin, and Victoria College, Belfast. 
Of the schools founded and carried on by women. giving advanced edu- * 
cation there were 21 represented. 
Of special schools there was the Rechelle school, Cork, for daughters 
of army officers and professional men; there were also 7 schools belong- 
ing to the Society of Friends. 
From Scotland there were exhibits from the school board of Edin- 
burgh, including the Royal high school, founded early in the twelfth 
century, and several public schools. From the same city there was the 
School of Medicine for Women and the Scottish Association for the 
Medical Education of Women, and from the school board of Glasgow 
there was an exhibit of plans of schools, maps, reports, drawings, ete. 
There was also an exhibit from Queen Margaret Medical College. 
In fine arts Her Majesty the Queen sent six original sketches from 
nature, also a copy in water colors from an oil painting, life-size. 
Two pictures in oil by Her Royal Highness Princess Christian of 
Schleswig-Holstein were exhibited; also a study from nature in water 
colors by Her Royal Highness Princess Louise, Marchioness of Lorne; 
also a picture by Her Royal Highness Princess Beatrice, Princess 
Henry of Battenberg. Among the other pictures of interest was one

by Madame Bodichon, founder of Girton College. In handicrafts the 
Queen exhibited two napkins made from flax spun by herself, also a 
hat plaited by herself, given to her granddaughter Princess Victoria; 
- there was also a corner chair carved of oak and cut and embossed cow- 
hide by Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales; embroidery on . 
linen and knitted jersey by Her Royal Highness Princess Helena; a 
music stool of carved oak and cut and embossed cowhide by Her Royal 
Highness Princess Victoria of Wales; also one by Her Royal Highness 
Princess Maud of Wales. 
Illustrations of training in handiwork by women were numerous and 
instructive, especially for the students of manual training. 
Edueation in agriculture, forestry, and veterinary is carried on less 
in schools and more in practical association with farm work. Compared 
with other nations, progress in agriculture has been only slightly pro- 
moted by State aid, but has been mainly due to voluntary associations 
and to private individual exertions. In 1889 the board of agriculture 
was created, with a president directly responsible to Parliament. To 
this new department was intrusted the small Government grant in aid 
of technical agricultural instruction and experimental research, the 
collection of the agricultural statistics, the administration of acts 
relating to the contagious diseases of animals, and all matters con- 
* nected with land, such as commons, inclosures, copyholds, drainage, 
buildings, and the like, as well as the ordinance survey, education 
receiving a small share of its attention. 
The Royal Agricultural Society of England exercises many functions 
analogous to those which are in other countries performed by the State. 
It holds annual fairs in different districts taken in rotation; tests inven- 
tions and enterprises, and offers prizes for improved live stock and 
implements and products; indeed, the society’s operations embrace 
practically every department of rural economy. In Scotland a similar 
society was formed in 1884, and has kindred functions. In Ireland 
agriculture is fostered mainly by the agricultural department of the 
Irish land commission. A great impetus has been given to agricul- 
tural education since 1889 by imperial grants administered by the 
county councils. As results, lectures in various departments of rural 
economy, butter-making demonstrations, and other kinds of dairy 
instruction have been largely organized and are accomplishing a most 
useful work. All students of agriculture appreciated the great Roth- 
amsted exhibition. The world-renowned Rothamsted experiments, com- 
menced in 1843 by Mr. Lawes (now Sir John Lawes, Bart.), celebrated 
their jubilee in 1893, Dr. Gilbert joined Mr. Lawes as chemist and col- 
league at the beginning. Sir John Lawes has recently created a munici- 
pal trust of $500,000 for the perpetuation of his experiments, thus 
continuing them as a most important contribution to agriculture. It 
will be seen from the above that there was no adequate representation 
of the work done in connection with the South Kensington and through-

out England in technical and industrial education under the science 
and art department. We may be sure America would have given a 
most hearty welcome to a full historic and comparative exhibit from 
the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. 
INDUSTRY TEACHING IN DONEGAL, IRELAND. 
This exhibit was under the supervision of Mrs. Dr. Hart, London, 
England. The building in which the exhibition was installed, as you 
approached it, had the appearance of a castle. In the several rooms 
in the interior was exhibited the actual work of spinning, weaving, 
making lace, ete., as carried on under the supervision of Mrs. Hart in 
the congested districts of Donegal. Here one obtained an idea of the 
rude looms, wheels, etc., as they were found, and of the improved 
machines introduced by Mrs. Hart. 
The population of the congested districts is believed to number not 
Jess than 100,000 persons. To understand the facts in the case, one 
needs to turn aside from the good high roads and wander among the 
thatched cottages, built of rough, unhewed stone. Thickly scattered 
among the granite bowlders are, on the treeless black bogs of the 
unhospitable coast, the hardy, penurious, and industrious population. 
The recurrent famines induced Dr. and Mrs. Hart to examine the facts 
for themselves. Their conclusion was, that the remedy was not so 
much in legislation as in education. They believed that the training 
they had seen among the peasants in Bohemia and the Tyrol could be 
made effective here. She began by establishing small experimental 
knitting agencies, then undertook the improvement in the making of 
homespuns. Then Donegal articles were of short lengths, of undyed 
wool, badly spun and woven, and of very primitive make, and there 
was no demand for them in the market. She found wild the same 
plants that elsewhere with skillful treatment furnished the best of 
vegetable dyes. Her first step, therefore, was to train the weavers 
and spinners in simple technical arts, to teach them how to extract 
beautiful and permanent dyes from the wild plants of the bogs, to 
induce and train them to spin with care and accuracy to certain counts, 
to improve their looms, and to instruet the weavers how to draft and 
twill and to make patterns. In all this Mrs. Hart’s knowledge of chem- 
istry, obtained in connection with her pharmaceutical studies, was of 
special service to her, as well as her extensive observation and study in 
the elevation of peoples elsewhere by the improvement of their industry. 
She first trained a Mr. Tighe, and then started him out among the 
cottages on an itinerant system of technical teaching of the spinners 
and weavers in their own homes. The potato pot, set up in some shel- 
tered spot among the rocks, had been their dye vat, and the leeches, 
heather, and bracken of the bogs were their dyeing materials. Mrs. 
Hart devised the Kells “ embroideries,” and took specimens of the 
improved products to exhibitions and to the markets, and soon there

was ademand forthem. The attention of the Government was attracted 
to her well-directed efforts, and a small substancy was granted, and the 
work was extended to include the training of the peasants by itinerant 
teachers in carpentry and wood carving and housekeeping. As the 
work advanced and its results justified, a school was established, and 
progress greatly quickened. Merchants began to find profits in con- 
nection with the new industry. A mill was established, and now it is 
believed as a result of these labors not less than a hundred thousand 
dollars are now annually paid into the congested Donegal district for 
homespuns. In the school established boys and girls are practically 
trained in spinning and weaving, both by hand and by machinery, in 
the technic of cloth manufacture, in dyeing, drawing, wood carving, car- 
pentry, wheelwright’s work, sewing, lace making, embroidery, making 
cloths, and tailoring. This school, with its advantageous workshops, 
forms a model for practical industry schools for the agricultural dis- 
tricts of Ireland. But of more value perhaps than all else is the reviv- 
ing of hope, the awakened intelligence, and-the increased industry of 
the people. Much remains to be done. 
FRANCE. 
Those who had seen the exhibitions of education by France in Paris, 
or that in New Orleans under the supervision of Mr. Buisson, were dis- 
appointed in the French exhibition at Chicago. There were special 
exhibits of education from Paris in the French Building, but the docu- 
ments and the pupils’ work sent by the ministry were in the French 
section of the Liberal Arts Building and the illustrations in agricul- 
tural instruction in the Agricultural Building. In each portion of the 
exhibit the logic of the French mind and the excellence of principles 
and methods were well marked: The educational collections in the 
French Building were of more value to those interested in industrial 
and reformatory training. In the French section one was able to gain 
a knowledge of the school laws; the methods of administration under 
the ministry; the qualifications required of teachers; the functions of 
the several] bureaus; the gradation of instruction, from the infant 
school. to the university; the qualifications required of teachers; the 
‘place and methods of normal schools; the place and methods of exam- 
inations; indeed, there were opportunities to gain information upon 
almost any feature of education in the Republic in which the visitor 
might be interested. The studies in the subject of education could be 
greatly increased in value if the visitor examined, in connection with 
them, the economical and social statistics which were beautifully worked 
out in graphic form and presented to the eye in the same section. 
Studies equalling these in social economics have been rarely offered. 
The pupils’ work exhibited, we were assured, was not specially prepared 
for Chicago. The well kept notebooks of pupils were especially in- 
structive. Into these more permanent books the pupils at intervals 
     
-P-A-G-E-1190
  1180 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
transfer their temporary work, and when they are preserved from year 
to year they furnish the opportunity of marking the improvementof the 
pupil from term to term and year to year. The careful gradation of 
French manual training is especially noteworthy, and so is the use of 
illustrations in teaching natural history and science. 
The influence of the pedagogical museum can not be too highly com- 
mended. The libraries furnished for the reading of parents were well 
illustrated. The excellent quality of the drawing was universally com- 
mended, It will be remembered that the French commission were dis- 
satisfied with the methods of awards adopted by the managers of the 
Columbian Exposition. The educational, therefore, like other features 
of the French exhibit, was not offered for the examination of the board 
of judges. Moreover; these boards were deprived of the advantage 
that would have been gained from the cooperation of eminent French 
experts in the several departments. Fortunately, educators had the 
opportunity of meeting and conferring with the eminent French edu- 
cators present, especially in the See ae Congress of Education. 
In the elementary section Mr. Buisson, delegate from the ministry of 
public instruction, in discussing the question, What shall be the plan 
of work for a common public school? showed with what care the cur- 
riculum of public instruction is prepared. He called attention to the 
tendency of each one to overestimate the value of his specialty. One 
would make too much of arithmetic, another of geography, another of 
reading, another of handicraft. In-the reform of education in France 
he gave us to understand that the greatest possible effort had been 
made to give each subject its proper place and amount of attention. 
He said: 
After the important bills which do so-much honor to the republican government, 
and by which all necessary schoolhouses and training colleges, even of the higher 
order, were created, and education was made free, unsectarian, compulsory, after the 
example of America, our educators and school authorities had to face the theory 
problem of the curriculum. 
I must say that they took great pains over it, and here I think it is not out of 
place to describe shortly, to those who are less familiar with our modern French 
institution, a most important one in regard to educational matters. I mean our 
Conseil supérieur de l’instruction publique, a kind of semi-elective council of advisers 
of the minister of education, whose principal function is precisely to prepare or 
revise school programmes, school curricula of all grades. 
This assembly, which is unique, as far as I know, in the world, is most liberal and 
representative in its composition. It was created by a law (1880), and includes, 
besides 9 high functionaries of the educativn department appointed by the head of 
the State, 45 members elected by the universities, learned societies, and schools and 
colleges of all grades. The elementary teachers themselves elect 6 representatives 
in the council, which is really a parliament of education and perhaps the only one 
in Europe. 
Now, it is those gentlemen, presided over by the education minister, who sat 
together and slowly and carefully elaborated our curriculum, which is surely not 
perfect, but which was the object of much thinking and talking over. 
~ It embraces morals and civics, reading, language (with object lessons, of course), 
arithmetic, geometry, elements of natural science, elements of national history, geog-
-P-A-G-E-1191

raphy, writing, drawing, singing, and gymnastics, with the addition of manual work, 
graduated so as to continue what was already begun in kindergarten (cardboard 
sloyd in small schools, bench and metal work in large ones), and also elements of 
commercial tuition and elements of agriculture. 
The industrial and agricultural programme, which is entered upon even in the 
elementary schools, is of course much developed in the high school, which we call 
école primaire supérieur, and which is quite different from the classical high school, 
or lycée, which in France belongs to what we call secondary instruction. As a fact, 
this scheme exists in France, generalized by our centralization. 
As I said, the fault of this programme, it may be candidly admitted, is, perhaps, 
that it is too complete; there is ‘‘surabondance de richesse.” And of course it would 
be better to omit some branches than to flutter about everyone, butterfly like, for 
if we avoid the danger of narrowness we ought not to run in the opposite danger of 
overpressure and overloading. 
But, in my opinion, this danger may be ayoided if the teacher is well trained and 
keeps to the spirit, not to the letter, of the programme. There are very good pre- 
ambles explaining the curriculum in the same way as those which many of your 
city and State superintendents, if I remember rightly, place before the school regu- 
lations issued by the board. 
Here are, for instance, the instructions to the teachers about the mental or intel- 
Jectual part of the school curriculum, subdivided into the three studies—physical, 
intellectual, and moral. In conclusion, if the school programme is thus understood 
with its objectivesinstructive character, less bookish, less scholarly and formal than 
in former times, and worked in that spirit by the teacher, if the school time is not 
cut up into small sections, if reading is made the means by which a great portion of 
the supplementary subjects are introduced into the school routine, even an extensive 
curriculum may be carried out without confusion and overpressure. 
But, of course, the success depends a great deal on the teacher; all will be easy if 
he or she carefully prepares a lesson on chemistry, physiology, or botany, for instance, 
by diagrams, pictures, and specimens. For this purpose school museums are inval- 
uable and can scarcely be dispensed with. As to manual work, either cardboard 
work, or woodwork, or ironwork, or modeling with clay, or gardening for boys, and 
needlework, cooking, and ironing for girls; let those occupations be advocated as 
most necessary whenever the school authorities can afford to supply the teacher with 
the necessary implements, for even when this kind of occupation does not serve to 
turn the children’s tastes toward adopting industry and trade as their avocations, 
they have a most beneficial influence, first, as derivative from overpressure in mental 
work; secondly, from a social point of view in enforcing respect for the dignity of 
handicraft and manual labor; thirdly, on purely pedagogical grounds. But before 
the age of 10 or 12, if they are added to the school curriculum, means must be devised 
so as to bring them partly before or after the regularschool hours, or else the children’s 
time for the most necessary branches, those which bear the examination for the cer- 
«tificate of elementary studies in France, would be insufficient. When parents leave 
their children at school until they reach 14 years of age, manual work or scientific 
notions necessary to agriculture and gardening are most useful, for it is between 
12 and 14 that the children show a great fondness for those active occupations and 
are capable of making some real progress in them, and, besides, it is a critical age, 
a turning point in life, when they are likely to choose their avocation, and a well- 
ordained course in manual or agricultural work may have a very decisive influence 
over their destiny. 
THE GERMAN EMPIRE. 
The exhibits of the German Empire were numerous and most inter- 
esting. They were, on the whole, not excelled by those of any foreign 
country. It was specially appropriate that German education should
-P-A-G-E-1192
a a ee ee eT Te ee eee 
1182 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
have fair attention, and it was much to be regretted that the space 
assigned it was not all that could be desired. Germany, through its 
education, has taught the world. All other progressive nations have 
taken lessons of German schoolmasters. America has not been behind 
jn laying under contribution either their learning or their methods. 
- Different German-speaking States have sent their representative 
teachers abroad to every section of our land. But from no State have 
they come in larger numbers than from Prussia. Thither, too, many 
American educators have hastened for their own preparation in the 
management of schools. Prussian schools chiefly occupied the reports 
of Bache, Barnard, Mann, and Stowe, who did so much a generation 
ago to shape our educational ideas and activities. It is well known 
that Rev. Charles Brooks traveled up and down Massachusetts inform- 
ing, by his lectures, the people of the advantages of normal schools 
and urging their establishment before the first was opened at Lexing- 
ton under Father Pierce by the aid of Mr. Dwight’s $10,000. It is 
perhaps also well known that ‘Mr, Brooks gained his knowledge and 
inspiration from conversations with a German gentleman whom he met 
on board a vessel crossing the Atlantic. Not a department of our 
school work has failed to receive aid from what has been done in Ger- 
many. It was specially pleasing to Americans that a gentleman so 
eminent as Dr. Stephan Waetzoldt, a professor from the University of 
Berlin, should represent German education as the chief commissioner of 
his excellency the Prussian minister of education. It should be kept 
in mind that the German Empire, like our own National Government, 
is made up by the union of different States. As with us, so there, 
there is no national system of education. Each State directs its own 
school policy. American visitors would have enjoyed a representation 
from all the German States, but they recognized a fitness in the fact that 
this great German educational exhibit should be so largely from Prussia. 
Notwithstanding the space assigned to education was so limited that to 
give the material a reasonably fair display it was necessary to erect a 
second gallery above the main gallery where it was placed, its installa- 
tion made the most of the opportunity. Those were most fortunate 
who enjoyed the advantage of Dr. Waetzoldt’s explanations. What 
might seem to the casual observer as too mechanical in the way of sys-* 
tem, regulations, books, methods, and illustrations became only the 
material conditions, helpful to the spontaneous efforts of teacher and 
pupil. The theory of German education is indeed compulsory. The 
State fixes the conditions, and the parent must comply. The teacher 
must be qualified and do his work up to a high standard, according to 
regulations. The pupil must attend and conform in conduct and study 
to requirements. Both pupil and teacher must be workers. The spirit 
of military drill and precision is manifest. 
School reports are not published as frequently and as fully as they 
are in this country. The constitution of forty years or so ago contains
-P-A-G-E-1193
EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1183 
the fundamental principles of education upon which the system rests. 
But the special legislation expected to follow these educational provi- 
sions of the constitution has never been enacted, the orders or regula- 
tions of the ministry sufficing. The high order of education depends 
less upon the free choice of parents than upon the vigorous adiminis- 
tration of the ministry and the universal excellent qualifications of 
the teachers. The constitution makes education compulsory, provides 
the ways and means, allows none to teach but those whose qualifica- 
tions reach the required standard, and teachers and pupils and parents 
are required to discharge their respective parts.in the work of elemen- 
tary education.. The expenses of the schools are met by payments 
from the State treasury and from the local community, the State 
treasurer paying 18 per cent and the local communities paying 82 per 
‘cent. The amount paid by the State is derived mainly from taxation, 
but in part from the income of permanent school funds. Formerly 
tuition fees were required; but a recent tendency to make the schools 
free has manifested itself, and since 1888 tuition has been borne in part 
or in whole by the Government. Notwithstanding the compulsory 
character of the State school laws, there is great freedom of local 
action in certain particulars, and especially in cities. There is super- 
vision, but there is less expected of it than in certain American States. 
Indeed, as has been said, the superior qualifications of the teachers 
render it less necessary. The profession has the same rank as that of 
medicine or law or the ministry. Women are allowed to be teachers, 
but of the 75,000 teachers in the elementary schools only 10.6 per cent 
are women, and 89.4 per cent are men. 
There are 106 normal schools for men and 8 for women. Of these 114 
schools, 38 were Catholic, 72 Protestant, and 4 were mixed. The course 
of study extends over three or four years. - No foreign languages are 
taught. The common subjects of instruction are reviewed, and great 
emphasis is placed upon pedagogy. The teacher enters the profession 
for life. He is as much an officer of the State as is a military officer. 
After his active service ceases a pension is provided for him; and if 
he dies his widow and orphan children receive it. The compulsory 
school age is from 6 to 14. Schools continue during week days, but are 
closed the afternoons of Wednesday and Saturday, session generally 
continuing from 8 till 12 and 2 till 4, or 8 till 1 and 3 till 4. School- 
houses are not generally equal to those in America in elegance and 
convenience. Benches are generally long, with desks attached. Single 
desks are rare, but great improvements have recently been made in 
school architecture. The exhibition made manifest the great superi- 
ority of the German schools in apparatus, charts, maps, specimens of 
natural history, models, instruments, ete. These aids to education are 
not collected haphazard. They accord with the best pedagogical prin- 
ciples and are furnished by the school officers or selected by the teach- 
ers who know what is fit and appropriate. Great care is given to the 
   
-P-A-G-E-1194
  1184 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
conditions of health. The course of elementary studies corresponds 
very much with ours, perhaps placing more emphasis on drawing and 
natural or nature studies, which are receiving more attention in Amer- 
ican schools. Text-books are less used; instruction is more largely 
oral. The scientific method is manifest in the text-books and in the 
oral method, The thorough qualification of the teacher saves him from 
extravagances in the treatment of subjects and from the cultivation of 
the faculties of his pupils out of balance. The reasoning faculty is uot 
sacrificed to the memory. The teacher is always on the alert and gen- 
erally on his feet. Instruction in school hours is unsectarian. Relig- 
ious instruction is provided in other ways, according to personal choice, 
whether Protestant, Catholic, or Israelite. If the schools are of mixed 
faith, those of one belief retire while those of the other receive instruc- 
tion. Much less is made of examinations than in this country. Dis- 
cipline is strict. The docility of German children is often the subject 
of remark. While woman does not hold the position as teacher that 
she occupies in this country, many facts connected with the exhibition 
indicate the increase of opportunities for her instruction. The models 
of school baths was a subject of general surprise; yet it is true that 
the bathing pool connected with the gymnasium is found in America, 
However superior the scientific treatment of subjects in German text- 
books, they are far less attractive to the eye than American in paper, 
printing, and illustration. As might have been expected, the collec- 
tion of works on the history, theory, and practice of teaching was 
large. The exhibition made it clear that Germany knows how to honor 
those who do the people great service. The busts of her great educa- 
tors emphasize the personality of educational progress with excellent 
effect. 
WOMEN’S EDUCATIONAL UNION, BRESLAU, GERMANY. 
This interesting exhibition in the Women’s Building was presented. 
in five different parts. The first included plans, photographs, etc.; the 
second, industrial school work in embroidery, monograms, millinery, 
dressmaking, mending, darning, and patching; third, training school 
for nurses, including especially sewing with hand and machine on arti- 
_ cles for use in nursing babies and in dressmaking for children; fourth, 
specimens of work from the seminary for teachers of needlework, united 
with training for kindergarten teachers; fifth, school for photography, 
including views of the city and photographs of the pupils of the school 
for housekeeping, school for cooking, and kindergarten cu training 
school for nurses. 
AUSTRIA-HUNGARY. 
These countries, united under one chief ruler, are, however, separate 
governments in other respects—that is, each has its own legislature, 
executive department or administration, aud judiciary. Neither at 
Chicago answered the expectation of visitors either in the exhibition of 
 
-P-A-G-E-1195

articles illustrative of education or in the presentation of educational 
information. Yet there was much in the commercial and industrial. 
exhibit of the Empire to suggest to thoughtful minds the condition 
of instruction among the people. Both commerce and industry begin 
to respond to the increase of educational efforts in both countries. 
But the presence of rude methods and implements of industry among 
a considerable portion of the common people point to the greatness of 
the task which remains to be accomplished. In estimating the progress 
made it should be remembered that little had been attempted for the 
people generally before the revolution of 1848. From that period 
we find educational enactments and an educational ministry. In both 
countries religioug questions are a great source of embarrassment. 
In each country there is limited local participation with the ministry 
in the direction of school affairs. The constitution, which guarantees 
“all nationalities equal rights,” also affirms that ‘“‘each has the inalien- 
able right to secure and maintain its language.” This results in the 
multiplication of languages, often in small districts as well as large, 
and thus greatly hinders the progress of education. 
AUSTRIA. 
All statistics at hand are inadequate. Of the 24,000,000 set down in 
round numbers as the population of Austria, 3,200,000, or about 13.3 
per cent, are in the schools below the universities. Public regulations 
give early attention to child life, but they are not efficiently carried out. 
Definite provision is made for day nurseries for children of “working 
people for daily care and suitable occupation and to accustom them to 
cleanliness, orderliness, and good behavior, as well as to instill mto 
them a love of work.” Infants under 3 years of age are not received. 
Elaborate regulations also provide for kindergartens, attendance, meth- 
ods, aims, and qualifications of teachers. Vienna has led the way in 
educational progress. Some 546 kindergartens are reported. Of the 
elementary schools over 50 per cent are ungraded. Of these 17,276 pub- 
lic elementary schools, 19.4 per cent, are half-time or half-day schools. 
Pupuls are entitled to instruction without distinction of sex, and also 
without distinction of religious belief whether Protestant, Greek, Roman 
Catholic, or Jew. The language of instruction is German in 41 per cent 
of the public schools; Bohemian, in 25.5 per cent; Polish, in 9.6 per cent; 
Italian, in 4.9 per cent; Servian, in 1.8 per cent, ete. Of the 60,126 
teachers in the public elementary schools, 76 per cent were men and 24 
per cent women. Of the women, 6,930 taught only knitting, sewing, 
embroidery, or other handiwork to the girls twice a week, and of the 
men, 13,875 were teachers of religion, reducing the total to 39,321 who 
are engaged in teaching letters. Of every 100 persons in Austria 14.1 
are of school age—6 to 14—but only 11.9 per cent are enrolled in school. 
The execution of the compulsory education law was attended with 
nearly 200,000 sentences, either in imprisonments or fines; the resist-

ance is largely among the Slavic population. Physical training is 
taught in over 11,600 schools and industrial in over 10,000. Over 
13,000 schools have libraries and 428 districts have pedagogical libraries. 
In 1889, 55,846 students were enrolled in the schools of secondary 
instruction. : 
Austria has 8 universities, 6 polytechnic schools, 1 of agriculture, 3 of 
fine arts, 43 of theology, and 69 normal schools. During 1889 there 
were delivered 3,266 lectures in the universities; during the winter 
semester they were attended by 15,562 students; of these Vienna had 
6,371. 
The 6 polytechnic schools were attended during the winter by 1,724 
students, showing a considerable falling off since 1889, when the attend- 
ance was 2,026; the agricultural for the same term was attended by 246, 
which also shows a considerable falling off; the two mining schools en- 
rolled 97, and the schools of fine arts 433. Of the 43 theological schools 
39 were Catholic and 4 of other confessions. The 69 normal schools 
have an attendance of 9,415 students. forty-two of these schools were 
for men and 27 for women. In 39 German was the language of instruc 
tion,in 12 Bohemian,in 6 Polish,in 2 Italian,in 2 Servian,and in 8 sey- 
eral languages were employed. In commercial schools 10,000 students 
were enrolled. In 1889 there were reported 619 special industrial 
schools, with an attendance of 64,000 students. There were enrolled 
in music schools 13,979 students,.and in schools of forestry and agri- 
culture 2,618. 
HUNGARY. 
The interest in all which concerns Hungary, created in America by 
the visit of Kossuth, has by no means disappeared. A full exhibition 
of education and a fullrepresentation of its facts would have been most 
welcome at Chicago. The degree of self-government attained by Hun- 
gary in 1866 was followed in three years by special Hungarian direction 
of its own school affairs. By the census of 1880 the population was 
13,749,603, and the school population between the ages of 6 and 15 was 
2,468,624, and there were enrolled in elementary schools 2,015,612, or 
14.66 per cent of the children of school age. ‘The enforcement of com- 
pulsory attendance is in the hands of communal authorities. There 
was expended on schools 39 cents per capita of the total population. 
In 188% the State maintained 25 normal schools and the church 47, and 
the total attendance was 3,781 students, of whom 2,666 were young men 
and 2,118 young women. There were in attendance upon infant schools 
28,023 boys; girls, 21,043; total, 59,066. There is reported a need of 
5,000 additional schoolrooms to prevent overcrowding. Generally the 
rooms are furnished with blackboards, aids to teaching arithmetic, 
globes, wall maps, models for drawing, and other aids to instruction. 
There are 7,033 educational and juvenile libraries. Of every 1,000 
schools 538 have a school garden; 2,874 schools have halls for gymuas-
-P-A-G-E-1197
  
EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1187 
ties, and 7,855 have grounds for open-air gymnastics; 76 per cent of 
the elementary teachers have their residences connected with the school- 
houses. There were 43,670 students receiving secondary instruction; 
of these 45.7 spoke one language and 54.3 per cent spoke two or more. 
Hungary has 3 universities—in Klausenburg, Agram, and Budapest; 
1 polytechnic school, 11 law schools, and 53 schools of theology. The 
number of students in attendance on the universities was 4,098, on the 
polytechnic school 616, on the law schools 792, and on the schools of 
theology 1,855. According to the report of the same minister, Hun- 
gary had 278 courses for industrial training or instruction in trades, 
with 46,288 students; it also had 83 workshops for home industries 
with 5,466 apprentices; it had 75 elementary and 22 secondary com- 
mercial schools, the former having an attendance of 4,086 and the latter 
1,870. Students in schools for midwifery numbered 472. A normal 
school for teachers of drawing was attended by 90 students; a similar 
school for fine arts by 110 students; a school for music and drama by 
136, and the schools for defective classes had 3,210 pupils. The total 
annual appropriation for 1891-92 was reported to be $3,643,762. 
ITALY. 
Italy as a government did not exhibit its education at Chicago. 
Public attention is most attracted to what is said in current publica- 
tions (1) of the appropriations to education, which, however inadequate, 
have gone up from $9,000,000 in 1872 to $18,500,000 in 1890, and (2) 
to what is said of Italian illiteracy, which has gone down in a similar 
period from 78 per cent to 50 per cent. 
The high position of Italian art gives the world some notion of what 
is done for its cultivation, while the frequency with which workmen 
from Italy are found who have been trained in some trade school con- 
veys some idea of the dissemination of industrial education. The 
efforts of Cavour in behalf of the latter are well known. Indeed, that 
great statesman did not fail to comprehend the part that education 
must perform in the unification of Italy. He believed that the enlight- 
enment of the people would enable them to rise from the degradation 
to which they had sunk, and increased facilities for their instruction 
marked every step of progress. Schools established for the benefit of 
the soldiers have done a great work. Their enrollment in 1891 reached 
369,000, and the total enrollment of elementary schools 3,306,266. Sec- 
ondary instruction is imparted in nautical, commercial, agricultural, 
and other industrial and normal schools and in classical schools. The 
attendance on secondary instruction advanced from 43,798 in 1871 to 
85,600 in 1890 in classical and technical schools. There are 134 normal 
schools, of which 26 rank as inferior and 108 as superior; 36 are for men 
and 98 for women. Under the new régime the education of women has 
made great advance in Italy and her condition has correspondingly 
improved, but much remains to be done. The progress of the instruc- 
 
-P-A-G-E-1198
  1188 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
tion in agriculture has done much to restore barren lands to produc- 
tiveness and increase the fruits from the soil, and thus promote the 
comfort of the people. To the world outside of Italy its universities 
have long been the most conspicuous illustrations of its educational 
opportunities. There are 21 having the faculties of law and juris- 
prudence; 11 philosophy and literature; 20 medicine and surgery; 15 
mathematics and physics. As aids to university work there are 239 
laboratories and museums. Important reforms in administration and 
instruction have been for some time under consideration. Instruction 
in the fine arts and in music have long been highly regarded in Italy, 
In connection with education special attention is paid to antiquities, 
The unification of educational administration is well established. At 
its head is the minister of public instruction; he is assisted by a council 
composed of 22 members; associated with the ministry there is a royal 
commission of 5 members; cooperating with the ministry are 69 provin- 
cial councils. In the leading cities there are already 6 female inspec- 
tors; 6 special experts are charged with the care of antiquities, monu- 
ments, excavations, museums, and art galleries; 6 others license the 
exportation of antiquities and fine arts. Infant asylums in Italy have 
long contained large numbers of children to which a limited measure of 
instruction was imparted. Of late the methods of Frobcel have been 
introduced to great advantage. In 1889 there were 2,818 of these insti- 
tutions containing 268,954 children. It is hoped that ere long kinder- 
garten methods will prevail among them all. 
DENMARK. 
COMMON SCHOOLS. 
The present arrangement and administration of these schools is 
founded on two laws from 1814, which have, however, been altered by 
later decrees. One of the said laws regulates the common schools in 
towns, the other those in the country, but the fundamental principles 
are alike for both. 
Still, ic must be noted that in the course of some twenty or thirty 
years most of the greater towns have themselves reorganized their 
common schools, which nowadays give the pupils an amount of know]l- 
edge that greatly surpasses the standard fixed by the laws. All chil- 
dren at the age of 7 to 14 years must attend some school, unless their 
parents or tutors have them taught satisfactorily in some other manner. 
Sometimes children are permitted to leave school at the age of 13, pro- 
vided they have attained the knowledge and ability they have to 
acquire during their school time. Parents who neglect to send their 
children to school are fined. 
In the common schools are taught religion, writing, reading, arithme- 
tic, singing, gymnastics, history of Denmark, and geography. Besides, 
the teachers have to teach the children as much as possible of all that 
will counteract prejudices and develop their ability for work. The
-P-A-G-E-1199
    EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1189 
aim of the school is to make the children good Christians and citizens, 
and to give them such knowledge and powers as will serve this end. 
Every parish is to have a school, but several of them have more than 
one. This is necessary, partly because the law forbids any child to 
have a longer way to school than 1 English mile and partly because no 
single teacher must have a greater number of children than 100 in the 
country or 80 in the towns. 
In towns every school often has two teachers or more, but in the 
country it is common that one teacher has two schools, namely, a pri- 
mary school for children from 7 to 10 years and the usual common 
school. 
Every parish has to pay school expenses, but the Government gives 
yearly 400,000 kreutzer to the salaries of teachers and 365,000 to the 
school funds, out of which are paid pensions for teachers and contribu- 
tions to the salaries of assistant teachers. 
Every appointed teacher who has held a situation for ten years is 
entitled to a pension in case of his being unable to work any more. 
After ten years of service his pension will be half of his salary, and 
after twenty-nine years two-thirds of it. 
Teachers’ widows only receive one-eighth of the salary, but every 
teacher has to secure his wife some life insurance, and the Government 
takes care that he performs this duty. 
Every parish or town has its school board, which works under the 
_ superintendence of the Government. The supreme authority under 
which resort all the schools of the country is the ministry of church 
and schools. . 
STATISTICS. 
According to statements from reports of 1880 the number of schools 
in the country was: (1) Public common schools, 1,586, with 3,103 
teachers, of whom 400 had passed no examination; women teachers, 160, 
of whom 142 had passed no examination; pupils, 203,107. (2) Private 
common schools, 270, with 181 teachers, of whom 94 without any exam- 
ination; women teachers, 96, 94 without any examination. (3) Private 
primary schools, 168; teachers, 41; women teachers, 127; pupils, 2,355. 
The expenses of the parishes to common schools in the country were 
about 3,000,000 kroner. To private common schools was given about 
10,000 kroner, and to primary schools, 3,000 kroner, besides 8,000 kroner 
to sewing schools. 
In 1890 there were in towns (Copenhagen not included) 118 common 
schools, with 601 teachers; 463 women teachers, and 40,364 pupils. The 
school expenses in towns were in 1880 about 10,000 kroner; 1890, about 
12,000 kroner. 
THE HIGHER SCHOOLS. 
The Latin schools were formerly superintended by the board of the 
university, but since 1848 they have been laid under the ministry of 
church and schools. A bill of Parliament is necessary to change the 
material foundation of the higher schools.
-P-A-G-E-1200
a i a pes a a a 
1190 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
The schools are superintended by a board of 3 members selected for 
three years by the Government. They have special superintendence 
for gymnastics and singing. 
The number of public Latin schools is 12. Only one of them, that 
of Soré, is a boarding school. The number of pupils is, for the present, 
1,863. 
At every school is appointed a rector, several head masters, and 
assistants. The salary of the rector is 4,000 to 5,000 kroner, The 
teachers are all entitled to pension; their widows, too. 
The conditions on which a boy is admitted to a Latin school are that 
he must be 12 years of age and have a sufficient amount of knowledge. 
Most Latin schools have founded preparatory schools. The schools 
have 6 classes, each of one year. As arule the number of pupils in a 
class is not to surpass 25. The daily school time is not divided, accord- 
ing to a general wish of the parents. It is six hours a day—in summer 
from 8 to 2, and in winter from 9 to 3 o’clock, with ten minutes’ play 
every hour and twenty minutes for breakfast. Only at Soré is the school 
time divided. 
The aim of the Latin schools is chiefly a sound general culture, besides 
‘to prepare the pupils for the university, and finally to give them the 
scientific education which is also necessary in other positions. 
The instruction falls into two subdivisions—the linguistic-historical 
and the mathematic-scientific. 
The following disciplines are taught: Danish (including Old Icelandic 
and Swedish), German, French, English, Latin, Greek, religion, history, 
geography, arithmetic, science, drawing, writing, singing, and gymnas- 
tics. French is considered the most important of living tongues. Eng- 
lish is only taught as an experiment. In Latin 120 chapters of Cicero 
must be read, one book of Livius, one of Tacitus, two books of Virgil’s 
Aineid, the letters of Horace and two of his odes, besides as much cur- 
sory reading as will be equal to two books of Livius. In mathematics 
the pupils learn arithmetic and algebra, stereometry, plane geometry, 
analytic geometry, ete.; in science, chemical and mechanical physics, 
and astronomy. 
There are taught gymnastics, military drill, swimming, and sometimes 
dancing and sloyd. 
Except in the two highest classes the home work is not to exceed 
three hours a day. The pupils graduate publicly every year. 
Part of the pupils graduate from the fourth class, and then have the 
same, rights as those who have passed the so-called “Preliminwrex- 
amen,” which will be mentioned later on. 
From the sixth class the pupils graduate to the university. Those 
who belong to the linguistic-historical branch are examined in Latin, 
Greek, French exercise, and science; the mathematic-scientific, in math- 
ematics and science. Common for both are Danish, French, German, 
~ or English, and history.
-P-A-G-E-1201
  EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1191 
Those who have graduated in the mathematic-scientific branch have 
access to the polytechnical school, besides to the university. 
The payment for instruction at the public Latin schools varies from 
120 to 170 kroner yearly. It is not difficult for poor, diligent pupils 
to obtain stipends. Gratis instruction can be given to one-sixth of the 
pupils. Pupils who have been taught privately can obtain access to 
the university by passing an examination either at a public Latin school 
or at a private one which has the right of graduating pupils. 
A private Latin school can be founded with the permission of the 
King. The Government controls the examinations passed there. 
There are at present 22 private Latin schools, of which one is a 
school for girls, managed by a woman, as is also one of the boys’ 
schools. The number of pupils in these schools is 2,221. 
“Preliminerexamen” is an examination introduced in 1881 instead 
of different smaller and greater examinations. It can be passed at 
public and at private schools. The pupils graduate in Danish, English, 
German, or French; history, geography, mathematics, and science. 
Religion, writing, drawing, gymnastics and singing are generally taught. 
This examination gives access to the Veterinary and Agricultural Col- 
lege, the lower law school, the school for pharmacy, for dentists, for 
officers, to appointments in the post and telegraph service, etc. With 
several additions it will also give access to the university. 
Women are not admitted as pupils to the public Latin schools, but 
they are allowed to graduate there. From 1882 they have the right of 
passing the “Preliminerexamen” and many secondary schools take 
pupils of both sexes. “Praliminerexamen” gives to women the same 
aecess to schools and examinations as men have, but it gives them no 
right to public appointments. 
Women are admitted to the university on the same conditions as men. 
They may also pass all examinations at the university except that of 
theology; here there is a special examination arranged for them which 
does not give them any right of preaching. 
To the university belong a great many donations for the benefit of 
poor students, houses where they can live free, ete. 
There is a library, a botanical garden, a zoological and a mineralog- 
ical museum, an observatory, several laboratories, etc. 
The university is a State institution to which belong several funds, 
consisting partly of lands, partly of money. 
Denmark has only one university, founded 1478 by King Christian I. 
It is superintended by the ministry of church and schools. Before 
a professor is appointed the special faculty is consulted. If there are 
more solicitors a public competition will take place. The election is to 
be confirmed by the King. Everybody who has acquired the degree of a 
- doctor has the right of giving lectures at the faculty to which he belongs. 
All the professors form an association which assembles four times a 
- week or whenever the rector of the enter wants it. This associa- 
tion has to choose the rector.
-P-A-G-E-1202
    1192 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. - 
There are five faculties—the theological, the medical, the philosophi- 
_ cal, the mathematic-scientific, that of law and political economy. 
The number of students who in 1893 graduated to the university was 
400. The studentsmust have graduated from a Latin school; they have 
liberty to hear whatever lectures they choose. 
When the professor permits it, others, too, who do not prepare for any 
_ examination, may attend his lectures. 
All lectures and exercises, belonging to studies of examinations, are 
. gratis. The academic year is divided into two semesters of four 
months each. 
After the first year’s study, every student passes an examination of 
philosophical propedeutic. The students are examined now and then 
to try their diligence and progress. 
Every student must prove that he has followed a certain number of 
lectures before he is admitted to the final graduation. The students 
are examined by their own professors. Censors are appointed and 
paid by the Government. 
Besides the here-mentioned schools, Copenhagen has a very large and 
excellent State university for farmers, gardeners, and foresters, another 
for engineers (“ polytechnic” school), a manual training school (‘+ Tec- 
nic school”), and an academy for pharmacists. Only the first of these 
schools admits women (till now only one woman has graduated there). 
Four State normal schools for teachers (in the country) admit only 
men, while a number of private normal schools educate either female 
or male teachers. A special Danish kind of schools (adopted, though 
after Danish pattern, by Sweden and Norway) are the so-called high 
schools where in winter young men, in summer young women, some- 
times both sexes together (mostly of the serving classes), seek a relief 
from manual labor and a renewal of their school knowledge, while still 
the chief object of these schools is to give them a more ideal view of life 
than is generally found among hand laborers. In some of these schools 
the course is longer, and then farming or manual training may form 
part of the curriculum. Generally the chief part of the teaching is oral 
(lectures), no part of it is compulsory, and no examination ever takes 
place. These schools are from the beginning wholly due to this private 
initiative of the enthusiastic followers of the poet-pastor Grundtvig 
(1791-1877). For years they were considered dangerous, as fostering 
too much political independence. In later years they have been imi- 
tated by different more conservative factions. Now it is thought that 
they may counteract socialism in a happy way, and they accordingly 
are now supported by the Government. 
SWEDEN. 
Sweden exhibited especially instructive series of models illastrating 
Miss Hulda Lundin’s system of teaching girls sloyd or needlework in 
the public schools of Stockholm, where she is superintendent of this 
department of instruction. :
-P-A-G-E-1203
  
EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1193 
The models were made by pupils in the public schools (primary and 
grammar) of Stockholm (age 7 to 14 years). The models were ‘well 
executed and were so installed as to convey a clear idea of the systéni.. 
Miss Lundin says: 
The aim of the instruction of girls in sloyd is: (1) To exercise hand and eye; (2) 
to quicken the power of thought; (3) to strengthen love of order; (4) to develop 
independence; (5) to inspire respect for carefully and intelligently executed work; 
and at the same time (6) to prepare girls for the execution of their domestic duties. 
The instruction has two objects in view: (a) It shall be an educational medium; 
(0) it shall fit the girls for practical life. 
Experience has proved that the desired results can be best reached 
by (1) practical demonstration of the subject, (2) progressive order 
with regard to the exercises, and (3) class instruction. 
(1) Practical demonstration in sewing is accomplished by means of a 
sewing frame, and in knitting by means of large wooden needles and 
colored balls of yarn. At the same time, blackboard drawings are 
constantly being made. 
(2) The exercises are planned and carried out in the most strictly 
progressive order, so as to enable the pupils to execute well the work 
required of them. 
(3) The instruction in sloyd should, like that in other branches, be 
given to the whole class at the same time, otherwise the time which the 
. teacher could devote to each pupil separately would be insufficient to 
secure the desired results. | 
In order to illustrate the progress from the simple to the more com- 
plex in the teaching of sloyd (this term embraces all kinds of handi- 
work) we give the following class divisions of the subjects which arein 
use at the present time in the public schools of Stockholm:

      Miss Lundin ealls attention to the fact that the simple, logical, and 
progressive plan adopted in teaching other branches has been too much 
neglected in manual training. She says it is not sufficient to give out 
lessons to be committed to memory; they must also be thoroughly 
explained by the teacher; suitable mediums of instruction must be 
sought and class teaching maintained in order to secure thoroughness 
and inspire interest. As soon as any exercise is well learned, it should 
be applied to something useful either in the school or home. In this 
way the pupil’s interest is awakened and strengthened. The child will, 
in such eases, see the result of its work such as it can understand; 
moreover, the parents’ sympathy will be won. 
She holds that the teachers by appealing to the whole class at once 
ean secure the attention of the pupils and awaken lively interest. She 
can impress ideas of form, size, and the reason for doing this and not 
doing that, thus making the instruction both developing and educating. 
But class teaching should not be all. The teacher must not guide every 
step. It is only the new in each step that should be explained to the 
whole class. When the pupils have learned through explanation and 
illustration what they must do, they should work independently of each 
other, and the teacher should give attention to them separately, seeing 
that each performs correctly the required exercise. She should observe 
the positions of the body and the hand, also whether the pupils hold 
the work at a proper distance from their eyes, so that they may not 
gain skill at the expense of their eyesight. She repeats with emphasis 
that the teacher of manual work should not only instruct, but educate 
the pupils as well. Therefore the choosing of the teacher is not an 
insignificant matter. Besides manual dexterity, teachers should be 
possessed of pedagogical skill. Therefore for the training of teachers 
in manual training, either special normal schools should be established 
or, what is without doubt better, existing normal schools should place 
manual training in their curriculum on an equal footing with other 
branches of education. That is now done in Sweden.
-P-A-G-E-1205
EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1195 
She holds, too, that not only girls, but the younger boys should be 
instructed in girls’ sloyd. The boys should be taught this because it | 
introduces variety and interest, trains the hand and eye, and renders 4 
them able to meet many possible conditions of necessity. 7 
The Swedish or the “Ling” sy stem of gymnastics can be briefly 
characterized as follows: 
The movements in their nature and iets number are founded on the 
human organism’s natural need of exercise, and the possibility of its 
perfect development to health and capability of work. The gymnastics 
ean also preserve or secure a development already gained. 
The aim of these gymnastics is to obtain as perfect health as possible; 
that is, a harmony between the different organs and between their 
functions, Skillfulness has but a secondary place, but it is obvious 
that the human body will best receive the harmonious development for 
which it is fitted when the organism itself is used in its own perfection 
in relation to physiological laws. 
The numerous exercises which come into use in these gymnastics are 
divided into families, groups, or tables:arranged according to likeness 
in the effects produced upon the different organs. 
All the movements in one such group are arranged in relation to the 
degree of exertion they cause. It is also a necessity, in the application 
of the exercises, to. use the different movements of a group in the pro- 
gression thus obtained; that is, the easier movements must precede 
those that are more difficult in such a manner that a coming movement 
is well prepared and introduced by the more simple exercises in the 
same family. This method most easily promotes vigor and prevents 
straining. 
The exercises ought to be practiced daily, each lesson to be composed 
of a harmonious collection of movements chosen from the various . 
groups. This produces most completely a proportional development of 
all the organs. 
The Swedish system of gymnastics is, more than any other, founded 
upon anatomical and physiological laws. It uses no movement without 
a knowledge of its effect, and, having always an end for its proceed- 
ings, it has acquired the right to be called rational. 
It contains a great number of movements to be found in no other 
system, and these movements are adapted in the manner most suitable 
for the wants of the body.. The apparatus in use has been constructed 
in regard to this view, and is so arranged that it facilitates the move- 
ments. Briefly, the movements are adapted to the body, and the appa- 
ratus has received a form that suits the movements. 
The apparatus in a gymnasium is arranged with a view to free space 
and its own accessibility. In general, it can be said, the Swedish appa- 
ratus and its arrangement in the gymnasium facie its use by a | 
_ great number simultaneously. From 100 to 200 boys ean be seen taking 
gymnastics ¢ at the same time in a large Swedish gymnasium with but :

one master present. The greater the similarity in age and develop- 
ment that exists among the pupils, the greater the number that can 
receive simultaneous instruction in gymnastics. 
NORWAY. 
This exhibit contained copies of pattern drawing and sewing of 
boys’ clothing, also of women’s and children’s dressmaking, by Amalia 
- Johannesen. Miss Rosing exhibited dressmaking and needlework as 
a common school branch, including plans and drawing for exercises in 
eutting and economizing, published by contribution by the Norwegian 
Government. One publisher presented an extremely interesting col- 
lection of school material, showing how largely instruction in Norway 
is aided by illustrated pictures. To aid in teaching religion, there 
were portfolios of biblical pictures, from the Old Testament and the 
New; for use in connection with arithmetic, a portfolio of metric 
measures and weights; to aid in writing and drawing, similar illustra- 
tions. The illustration of history, geography, natural science, sewing, 
and dressmaking were specially effective. 
A watchmaker exhibited a text-book on the art of watchmaking in 
our times, with engravings and drawings. A teacher of deaf-mutes 
exhibited (1) drawings for instruction in handicraft, and (2) a school desk 
and bench for combined common school use and instruction in manual 
training. 
A systematic exhibit of instruction as given in the elementary and 
secondary schools and the university and professional and special 
schools was wanting. 
Nothing from Norway attracted more attention than the Viking, 
under Capt. Magnus Andersen, which left Bergen, Norway, April 30, 
and which successfully overcame all difficulties of an ocean passage 
and reached Chicago safely, to the great delight of all visitors. 
In 1889 a vessel was exhumed from Gog, a mound at Gogstad, near 
Sanefjord, in southern Norway, which is now preserved in the uni- 
versity in Christiania, and it is supposed dates from about the year 
900; in a sepulcher in the vessel were found human remains. The 
Viking was an exact facsimile of this old vessel, and her successful 
sail across the Atlantic has a most important bearing upon whether 
the Norsemen could have crossed the Northern Atlantic in the ninth, 
tenth, and eleventh centuries. 
RUSSIA, 
Anyone familiar with the fact that in the vast Empire of Russia 
those in attendance on schools below universities were 2.6-per cent, as 
against 22 per cent in Bavaria, 17 percent in France, and 21.3 per cent 
in the United States, was unprepared to expect an exhibit of education 
so instructive and interesting from Russia as was found at Chicago. 
Few, moreover, were able to comprehend the relation of the several

schools to the authority by which they were directed. Indeed, a com. 
paratively small share of the Russian educational exhibit, was cata- 
logued in Department L, liberal arts, group 149. It may be said that 
far from the total of the educational activities of the Empire are under 
the ministry of public instruction. Under the ministry of finances 
was exhibited the work of the trades schools, including (1) programmes 
of blacksmiths’ and locksmiths’ handiwork, samples of work, drawings 
and designs; (2) programmes of turners’ work, and samples; (3) pro- 
gramme of joiners’ work, and specimens, such as cupboard and tables; 
(4) drilling lathes; (5) force pumps; (6) cross-planing lathes; (7) gear- 
turning lathe. Under the ministry of communication are important 
schools. The pedagogical museum is under the ministry of war. 
Through the several ministers who communicate directly with the 
Czar, he conveys his imperial will to the vast Empire, embracing one- 
seventh of the surface of the globe. Under the ministers are a variety 
of subordinate grades of authority reaching every corner of the realm 
and every soulinit. There is (1) the Holy Synod, directing religious 
affairs; (2) the ruling Senate, with its nine subdivisions; (3) the coun- 
cil of state. Looking at administration we see a series of subdivisions, 
called governments and districts. Hach governor-general represents 
the authority of the Czar, both in regard to civil and military affairs. 
Here and there the deliberative element appears. The heads of families 
in a village community may asseiftble and deliberate and elect their own 
elder. These village communities may unite in a canton, and each 
canton has a chief officer elected by a cantonal assembly; but at every 
step the action of these subordinate grades of authority is limited by 
the will of the Ozar, which is supreme over-all. As a rule, class dis- 
tinctions are marked, and the diversity of population is great. 
In adaptation tothis complexity of governmental forms, the ministry 
of education organizes its system of schools, dividing the country into 
tweive circuits or divisions, with a chief for each, whom we might call 
curator, who has assistants or inspectors by which he reaches every 
school. Each public school is organized in accordance with the edict 
of 1874, which modified that of 1862. Schools may be orjginated by 
individual or private enterprise, but must conform to established regu- 
lations. The*types of schools are numerous, but the universities, gym- 
nasia, progymnasia, polytechnic, and real schools correspond in a 
measure to those of central Europe. The age of attendance varies 
greatly. No uniformity is observed in the provision of separate schools 
for boys and girls. There has been a gymnasium for girls since 1858, 
The higher education of young women has been looked upon with much 
favor, and especially their instruction in medicine. It has been stated, 
“the Russians have become so alive to the value of women physicians 
that the Imperial Government has granted $200,000 for a medical 
school for women, to be established at St. Petersburg, and that the site 
has been given by the city.” ‘The fact that only 20 in 100 of those who
-P-A-G-E-1208
1198 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
enter the army can read and write does not prepare one to expect the 
high order of scientific ideas found in many of the exhibits of educa- 
tional institutions, methods, and appliances. It would be difficult to 
name a government more vigilant in laying the progress of the world 
in science under contribution for the benefit of its administrative pur- 
poses. Everywhere in the Government may be found evidence of the 
presence of the most advanced scientific attainments; especially is this 
true of the army. As one meets these indications he is disposed to 
exclaim, If these scientific attainments could become universal among 
the people of all classes, what a multiplication of the power of the 
Empire would the world witness! The latest and fullest statement of 
the expenditures for education available are those for 1885, making 
under the minister of education $11,394,339, and under the Holy Synod 
and minister of war, navy, finance, of the state domain, of the interior,» 
of communication, of justice, of foreign affairs, and the director of the 
royal stud, $7,785,986, or a total of $19,180,325. 
Of this the universities received $1,621,760 and secondary schools 
$3,393,364, In the support of education the provinces and communes 
share; but how much they pay it is impossible to state. In the admin- 
istration the scientific and local element are seen to bear an interesting 
part. In the ministry there is a scientific council, which proposes 
courses of study and text-books, and provinces and communes bear a 
part both in expenses and the provision of plans. In the universities 
one supervising officer is appointed by the minister, but the programme 
of studies and the discipline are otherwise committed to the faculties. 
A gymnasium may have one council for general administration and 
another for pedagogical direction. The preparation of teachers has 
for a considerable period received increasing attention. Those grad- 
uating from normal schools, classes, or seminaries-are authorized to 
teach without further examination. Those seeking to teach who have 
not had the advantage of any of these pedagogical courses may be cer- 
tificated by the authorized commission on passing the examination 
required for the specified grade. 
Men and women are both employed as teachers. Often the women 
outnumber the men. Salaries in rural districts range from $277 down 
to $92 per annum in addition to lodging and garden; in city schools, 
from $482 to $386 with a house. In secondary schools and normal 
schools the teacher might receive $500, and the director or directress 
twice as much, with lodging. Teachers in rural districts are not always 
considered as holding such a relation to the Government as to entitle 
them to pensions, but those who are employed by the State receive 
a pension after twenty-five years of service. The subjects and methods 
of instruction in letters are much like those which prevail elsewhere, 
varying with the excellence of the teacher. The methods of Froebel 
are considerably favored in the infant or maternal schools. 
Religion is emphasized, especially that of the Greek Church, in the 
Government schools and in those under the Holy Synod. The exhibits

EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1199 
gave most ample evidence of the great extent to which industrial and 
technical instruction is favored in elementary, secondary, and special 
schools. The schools under the several ministers other than the minis- 
try of public instruction generally aim to train in the theory and prac- 
tice of the operations carried on under it. These practice schools are, 
therefore, very numerous, and their representation at the Fair consti- 
tuted a large share of the Russian educational exhibit. An eminent 
Russian educational writer says: 
From the earliest period our Government has endeavored to improve general edu- 
cation and spread it among the people, but middle and low grade technical and 
industrial education (not taking into consideration the practical technological insti- 
tute at St. Petersburg and the imperial technological school at Moscow, later 
merged into higher educational establishments) did not begin earlier than a quarter 
of a century ago. 
Americans will remember the impulse given to technical and indus- 
trial education among us by the Russian exhibit at Philadelphia in 
1876. President Runkle, of the Boston Polytechnic Institute, made 
special effort to call attention to its pedagogical excellence. In 1878 
the ministry of finance was charged with devising a plan for these 
schools. In 1881 many of them were transferred to the minister of 
education; and in 1888 a special division was organized in this ministry 
for the direction of technical and industrial schools, and the minister 
was required to create a temporary commission on which there should 
be a representation of each ministry under which these schools had 
previously been conducted. The action of the commission was approved 
in June, 1889. Thus it will be seen that the plan went forward under 
favorable auspices in a way to eliminate the earlier mistakes and adopt 
the best results at each step. These establishments for technical and 
industrial education were divided into five groups. To the first group 
belong three schools—the technical school at Moscow, the high grade 
artisan school at Lodzi, and the technical school at Irkutsk. To the 
second group belong the technical school at Cherepoveth, the artisan 
school at Timbirsk, and the Nicholas artisan school at St. Petersburg. 
Various railroad schools were also given the privilege of the third rank 
in military service, with the exception of the Nicholas artisan school 
at St. Petersburg, which enjoys high military privileges. The general 
instruction in these schools is much the same as in city schools, with 
* the addition of physics, mechanics, the technology of wood and metals, 
and bookkeeping. Drawing is specially emphasized. 
To the third group belong the artisan schools, instructing in subjects 
taught in elementary schools or village schools, of two classes. They 
aim at preparing master workmen in the various domestic industries 
of the village and in factories, such as cabinetmaking, blacksmith- 
ing, carpentry, carving, tailoring, shoemaking, bookbinding, and har- 
ness raaking. I 
To the fourth group belong schools for adults, such as the artisan 
school at Riga and those under the technical society of St. Petersburg. 
 
-P-A-G-E-1210
  1200 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Instruction is given evenings and Sundays, when workmen are not 
occupied. 
To the fifth group belong the general educational low-grade estab- 
lishments, including elementary, district, and city schools, with the 
extra artisan departments attached. To encourage local action the 
minister of education offers a subsidy where the local authority or 
individuals bear part of the expense. It is to be expected that there 
would be defects in the operations of so vast and varied a system. 
But this mere outline of it gives an idea of the vastness of its possible 
consequences. In 1890 a technical and professional congress was held 
to promote the efficiency of technical and industrial education. It is 
impossible to enumerate the exhibits which illustrate the progress of 
the adoption of these plans and have their place in these various 
groups. Of the 60 awards bestowed upon Russian educational exhibits 
9 were received by institutions each of which was named women’s col- 
lege, and 8 of which were known as girls’ institute. Outside of group 
149 there were many exhibits illustrative of museums and the work of 
societies for the promotion of improvement in home industries. The 
technical museum for peasants’ work at Moscow exhibited 22 articles; 
the children’s education bazaar of the same city, 10 articles, all illustrat- 
ing what is done in this home education in the making of those articles 
of common use. Foundling and orphan asylums exhibited many arti- 
cles illustrative of training of the children in these numerous child- 
saving institutions. The ministry of public instruction exhibited (1) 
its reports; (2) programmes and plans of teachings; (3) samples of 
schoolbooks and appliances used in middle and high schools; (4) writ- 
ings of professors of Russian universities; (5) work of pupils in dif- 
ferent subjects and grades of instruction; (6) natural history collections 
illustrative of different subjects taught; (7) photographs of schools; 
(8) publications of scientific societies, high schools, and pedagogical 
societies. : 
The pedagogical museum, under the ministry of war, was undoubtedly 
the center of attraction among the various Russian educational exhibits 
Those were especially fortunate who had the opportunity to examine 
this exhibition under the guidance of Prof. J. C. Heard, who had long 
had official connection with the museum, and held a rank in the Rus- 
sian military service corresponding to that of colonel in the American , 
Army. Many Americans will remember him as present at the Phila- 
delphia Exhibition. Scholarly, and of high character, devoted to the 
service of the Ozar, he was one of the most respected members of the 
board of judges in Department L. Among his duties at Chicago was 
that of purchasing those articles which he might find valuable in 
the way of promoting the improvement of educational methods, condi- 
tions, and appliances, therefore desirable in his museum, The date of 
the foundation of this museum has been given as 1863, but its for- 
mal opening is stated to have been the 9th of February, 1864. Its

first collections came mainly from Germany, England, France. and Italy. 
With it was connected a pedagogic library. Its first aim was the 
improvement of the methods and appliances of army schools, but it 
speedily influenced the manufacture of pedagogical aids in Russia, and 
its influence began to reach other schools. Indeed, when the museum 
originated, little school apparatus was made in Russia, and it took 
upon itself the manufacture of those articles which it exhibited. 
It 1871 the museum was removed to better quarters. From time to 
time it has been reorganized and special additions made. At present 
its director has the aid of two committees: (1) The household committee, 
which consists of all the officers of the museum, and specially concerns 
itself with its administration; (2) the school educational committee, 
who by their experience and pedagogical knowledge may be specially 
helpful in promoting the objects of the museum. It is now treated as 
asection of the Practical Science Museum of St. Petersburg. It seeks 
to attain its object by (@) permanent and temporary exhibitions; (b) 
explanations of the scientific and practical significance of its collec- 
tions; (c) scientific study in the museum, aided by its apparatus; (d) 
indication of means and methods for acquiring technical knowledge, 
publication of books, etc.; (€) communication with those needing its 
help. It has done much in organizing exhibitions at home and in shar- 
ing in exhibitions there and abroad, thus: (1) Acquainting schools with 
improvements; (2) bringing foreign apparatus to the attention of Rus- » 
sian manufacturers for their reproduction; (3) improving the quality 
and reducing the price of apparatus: 
At Paris, in the geographical exhibition in 1875, it stimulated the 
establishment of similar museums in other countries. Its share in the 
hygienic exhibition in Brussels in 1876 led to the establishment of the 
pedagogical museum in Belgium. The same year it shared in the exhi- 
ditions at London and Philadelphia. It exhibited in Paris in 1878, and 
was greatly honored. In 1871 readings and lectures were commenced, 
illustrated with its apparatus. These have been specially successful. 
One is before the writer on the subject of salt, printed in English, with 
illustrative pictures conveying a great amount of valuable information 
in a most attractive way. There are at present 28 technical railway 
schools in Russia, of which all but 3 belong to the Government, and 
the others are under its inspection. 
Russian subjects are admitted to these schools, but they are specially 
intended for the children, from 14 to 18, of those engaged in railway 
service. Their course of instruction embraces five years, three for 
study and two for practice on railways. During the three years of study 
in school there is taught: (w) Religion; (b) elementary mathematics, with 
the fundamental knowledge of bookkeeping and land surveying; (c) 
general knowledge of physics and practical knowledge of telegraphy; 
(d) a short course of general and applied mechanics (descriptive); (e) a 
short course in working wood and metal; (/) elementary knowledge of

architecture; (g) practice of railway business; (1) elementary and special 
drawing by hand and with the aid of instruments, as well as caligraphy, 
and (7) handicrafts, as locksmiths’, blacksmiths’, and joiners’ work. 
Besides this there are introduced into the school singing and gymnastics. 
Progress has been made in the education of the deaf and dumb. In 
sparsely settled regions ambulatory schools have been introduced with 
excellent results. 
JAPAN, 
Intelligent persons were prepared to expect an interesting and in- 
structive exhibit of education from Japan, especially those who were 
either familiar with its recent progress or acquainted with the wisdom 
of its Government in using education as the initiative and directing 
means in that progress, or who had been observant of the skill of its 
officers in employing exhibitions as opportunities for bringing the great 
improvements made in the Empire to the attention of the other peoples 
of the world, and they were not disappointed. 
Yet there was no special emphasis placed upon the educational 
exhibit by the Empire. The Japanese obtain important advantage 
from their care to use in speech, writing, and printing the language of 
the people with whom they do business. At Chicago, while using other 
modern languages, they were careful to usé English; this greatly aided 
American study of their exhibits. 
Unfortunately, the space assigned did not permit them to exhibit to 
the best advantage all the articles which they brought. 
Their exhibition of education was strongest in kindergarten, indus- 
trial and technical training, and grades of instruction below the uni- 
versity. 
The kindergarten exhibition was sufficiently complete to show that 
kindergarteners there strive to understand and practice the true prin- 
ciples of child culture. 
The interest in the earliest training of the child was so great that soon 
after its efficient introduction there were not enough trained conduct- 
ors to be found to answer the demand; consequently a private train- 
ing school was established in Tokyo, and classes were formed for train- 
ing conductors in the Tokyo Government normal school. It appears 
that there were, in 1890, 138 kindergartens, with 271 conductors, and 
4,185 boys and 3,301 girls, or a total of 7,486 in attendance; of these 
39 were founded by private beneficence and 99 by the Government. 
Their increase is encouraging. As in other lands, kindergartens are 
hardly known outside of the cities. In 1891 the attendance reached 
12,484, 
The specimens of child work exhibited were marked by the delicate 
construction characteristic of the people. The work presented from 
elementary schools was sufficient to illustrate in a good manner the 
methods adopted and progress attained. The character of the lan- 
 
-P-A-G-E-1213
  
EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1203 
guage taught does not admit of the rapid progress in its acqusition 
common in learning English, German, French, Italian, or Spanish. 
The introduction of modern text-books and methods, however, has 
reduced the time consumed, especially as compared with that occupied 
in China. 
Before the restoration of the Imperial Government the elementary 
schools were chiefly those established by feudal lords, and admitted for 
instruction the children of the upper military class, and sometimes the 
children of the lower military class. The length of the course extended 
over six or seven years and included reading of Chinese characters, 
writing, arithmetic, etc. A small fee was charged. 
After the restoration the new order of schools began in Kioto. The 
improvement was slight at first. The marked development began in 
1871, when six schools were brought under formal regulations. In 1872 
the education code established school districts and prescribed a course 
of study, The population of an elementary school district was esti- 
mated at 600. Ordinary elementary schools were divided into two 
grades, the upper and lower; the lower received children from 6 to 9 and 
the upper from 10 to 13 years of age—the whole course extending over 
eight years. The expense was borne by the district; tuition fees were 
charged. Butas the people were unprepared for so great an expense at 
onee—school buildings, books, apparatus, teachers’ salaries, ete.—the 
Government granted aid from the public treasury, which amounted to 
4,005,500 yen before the grant was discontinued in1881, In 1879 school 
districts were abolished and schools were to be maintained by town or 
village corporations and-managed by committees, and those trained in 
normal schools were to be employed as teachers; when this was inex- 
pedient, there was provision for ambulatory schools—tuition fees were 
to be charged or remitted according to local conditions; local taxes 
were supplemented by Government grants. Thus the progress of the 
schools has been marked by various changes. 
Schools in other countries have been much studied. Americans will 
remember the great interest taken in all that pertained to education by 
the Hon. Arinori Mori, that eminent and progressive statesman, the 
first Japanese minister resident at Washington. He spent much time 
in the Bureau of Education, sought the best educational experience in 
the country, published a book containing the opinions of eminent 
American educators, and drew in every possible way upon American 
experience for the benefit of his Government. Connected with the 
embassy extraordinary which visited Washington during his residence 
there were commissions of various kinds to study and report upon spe- 
cial departments of government, military, naval, financial, postal, edu- 
cational, etc. 
The chief of the commission in charge of educational inquiry was 
Hon. Fujimaro Tanaka, a scholarly and judicious statesman, and he 
had a number of associates and assistants, who for weeks commanded
-P-A-G-E-1214
  1204 ~ EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93, 
all the time that could be spared by the Commissioner of the United 
States Bureau of Education, and on his recommendation visited and 
studied important examples of education in the United States and con- 
sulted with our most eminent educators. Mr. Tanaka was senior vice- 
minister of education 1874 to 1878, and also 1878 and 1879. 
The interpreter for this commission was Joseph Hardy Nesima, in- 
whom Americans became so deeply interested. He came to Boston as 
a lad in one of the vessels owned by Mr. Alpheus Hardy, and at his 
expense was educated at Amherst and Andover, and returning to Japan 
founded a Christian university. 
The son of Mr. Hardy, a well-known author and the professor of 
mathematics in Dartmouth College, has written an exceedingly inter- 
esting and instructive life of Mr. Nesima, which is a valuable contribu- 
tion to the history of education among the Japanese. 
Mr. Tanaka has been in the foreign service of his country and has 
advanced from one position of honor to another, and is now one of the 
most trusted councilors of the Emperor. 
Mr. Mori for a time was thought at home to be too progressive, but 
was again called to positions of public trust, and was minister of state 
for education from December 22, 1885, to 1889, when he died by the 
hands of an assassin. When the embassy extraordinary was in this 
country, Hon. David Murry, LL. D., of Albany, was employed to go to 
Japan as the foreign councilor of the department of education, and ful- 
filled his engagement to the great satisfaction of the people of Japan. 
It is not surprising, therefore, that in this exhibit of education we find 
much to remind us of our own schools and methods, while the organi- 
zation and administration of the Japanese system of schools necessarily 
conforms to the imperial form of government, and therefore presents 
a complete contrast in this respect to forms of administering public 
instruction in America. 
As stated by an eminent Japanese authority: 
Notwithstanding the partial adverse influences exercised by the frequent changes 
effected in the educational laws, by faults in the manner of administration, and by 
the vicissitudes of political events, still it is an undeniable fact that during this 
short interval of twenty years education has, on the whole, been firmly established 
and steadily diffused from year to year. 
The statistics for the first period of six years reached the following 
numbers: Schools, 22,298; teachers, 47,433; pupils, 1,886,573; while for 
1891 they were, schools, 25,369; teachers, 69,586; pupils, 3,153,258» 
The imperial ordinance of 1890 classed the schools for apprentices and 
supplementary schools for technical instruction with elementary schools. 
The subjects of instruction authorized in ordinary elementary schools 
are morals, reading, composition, writing, arithmetic, and gymnastics. 
According to local conditions, gymnastics may be omitted and either 
Japanese history or Japanese geography, or drawing, sewing, or handi- 
work may be added; sewing, of course, for girls.
-P-A-G-E-1215
  EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1205 
It should be remembered that up to the time of the restoration of the 
Emperor to supreme power, female education in Japan was chiefly left 
to the home circle, and no provision was made for instruction of girls 
in public educational institutions. In 1872 the Tokyo female school was 
established; good progress was made, but the school was abolished and 
a special course was established for females in the Tokyo normal school. 
In 1882 a new higher school for females was organized in connection with 
the Tokyo normal school for females, and “a higher general course was 
taught with the view of educating refined and gentle women, the prin- 
ciples of morality being taken as the basis of instruction.” The sub- 
jects of study were morals, reading, composition, writing, arithmetic, 
geography, the history of Japan, natural history, physics, chemistry, 
drawing, sewing, etiquette, household management, music, and gym- 
nastics. The course of study extended over five years. 
In 1879 female schools were organized in five ken. In 1882 the schools 
were much improved by the regulations of the department of educa- 
tion. According to statistical investigations made at the end of 1890, 
the number of public higher female schools was 7, and that of private 
schools 21, while the number of pupils was about 3,000. “Although 
female education would seem to have made tolerable progress, it is 
exposed to the continual vicissitudes of the times, and is not as firmly 
established as that of the males. hus there is as yet no educational 
equality between the sexes.” : 
In a report given out since the Exhibition for the year 1892 there is 
stated to be in one grade of schools 987,391 female pupils to 2,298,311 
male pupils; 4,267 female teachers to 62,555 male teachers. The Empress 
specially promoted the advancement of woman’s education by becom- 
ing the patroness of the Female Normal School. 
Of the total population of 41,696,847, there are enumerated 7,356,262 
of school age, 6 to 14, of whom 55.14 per cent are attending school. 
The Japanese, early in the new order of things, recognized the train- 
ing of teachers as the fountain of all education, and established a 
normal school in Tokyo in 1872. Ever since the national Government 
has emphasized the importance of training teachers in principles and 
methods. In 1874 four others were added. Now normal schools are not 
only sustained by the national Government, but by local authority—by 
the fu and ken. Their graduates are authorized teachers, and persons 
not graduates must be examined before they can teach. Recently 
teachers’ institutes have been organized, and close inspection has been 
provided in order to insure good instruction and discipline in all schools. 
A marvelous work has been accomplished in twenty years. Much pains 
have been taken to introduce from other countries the recent pedagog- 
ical literature. 
It should be noted that the Tokyo Educational Museum is under the 
eare of the higher normal school. The Government, it will be remem- 
bered, early in its efforts for education, carefully collected from other

countries illustrations of school architecture, text-books, and appliances 
in order to hasten the acquaintance of teachers with the improvements 
sought to be made. Text-books were first published by the Govern- 
ment, and often distributed free to hasten their publication by private 
parties. These were frequently translations from approved text-books 
of other lands. The Japanese had the wisdom to lay the progress of 
all other nations under contribution for their own advancement. It 
will be remembered that Japanese young men were sent abroad to study 
in considerable numbers—in 1873 they numbered 373, of whom 250 
were sent at the expense of the Government—and that many foreign 
teachers were employed in their schools. 
In 1872 provision was made for schools above the elementary, known 
as middle schools, with a course extending over three years. This 
grade of instruction has continued through all vicissitudes. Regula- 
tions provide for the establishment and conduct of three schools in 
each fu and ken, and they have multiplied accordingly. In the course of 
study morals stand first, and then follow the subjects usual in such a 
grade, together with provision for instruction in special subjects, such as 
foreign languages, gymnastics, agriculture, ete. The first foreign lan- 
guage is usually English, the second German or French. At first these 
schools did not prepare for the university, but gradually the necessity 
of extending their course to meet that of the university has been recog- 
nized, and ere long it is anticipated that the step will be easy from the 
higher middle school to the university. 
The Imperial University is now firmly established on most modern 
scientific principles. It naturally crowns the educational work of the 
Empire. Aspiring students gather here from all its borders. As early 
as 1871 the Government ordered the various feudal lords to select young 
and intelligent pupils in number proportionate to the extent of their 
territories to be sent as students to the university. In 1873 courses in 
law, science, engineering, polytechnics, and mining were established. 
Law, science, and engineering were taught in English; polytechnics m 
French; mining in German. Preparatory courses were also provided. 
The university has kept up with the progress of the Empire, or rather 
has led it, adapting itself with great wisdom to the new conditions and 
demands. According to the imperial ordinance it has for its objects 
the teaching of such arts and sciences as are required for the purposes 
of the State and the prosecution of original investigation in such arts 
and sciences. It consists of the university hall, established for the pur- 
pose of original investigation, and the colleges for instruction, both 
theoretical and practical, viz, (1) the college of law; (2) of medicine; 
(3) of engineering; (4) of literature; (5) of science; (6) of agriculture, 
which has only recently been added. 
The history of the Imperial A gricultural College of Sapporo is exceed- 
ingly suggestive and illustrates the revolutionary progress of the Empire. 
The war of restoration over, the Government turned its attention to 
 
-P-A-G-E-1217

more peaceful pursuits. The northern islands of Japan, vaguely called 
Yezo,a sort of terra incognito, attracted special consideration. Known 
as the abode of a barbarian folk, called the Ainn, they were regarded 
as a dreary waste of snow and ice, unfit for the habitation of a race of 
higher culture. Soon it was found that the land was endowed with 
magnificent natural resources, a!most untouched by the human hand. 
The task of directing the Government’s efforts in this behalf was com- 
mitted to Gen. K. Kuroda, afterwards count and minister of communi- 
cation, At the end of two months he made a report dwelling upon 
education as a most potent factor in effecting the changes contemplated. 
Three months later he emphasized the same idea, and prevailed upon 
the Government to send abroad some young men to be prepared for the 
pioneer labors required. Where should they be sent but to America, 
where new lands were being brought under cultivation? His appre- 
ciation of education rose higher than ever. He visited America and 
studied for himself. He was especially struck with the part woman 
performed in promoting American progress, and in his reports to the 
Government showed that the pioneering must not be confined to the 
improvement of rivers or mountains, or even to the increase of popula- 
tion, but that it must take cognizance of the important labor of foster- 
ing human talents, of training youthful minds—that the first great aim 
must be the providing of men and women, properly equipped, to become 
the leaders of the new order of affairs. He closed by recommending 
the sending abroad of some young girls, and several were sent to Amer- 
ica. On his further suggestion a school was opened on the 21st of June 
in Tokyo, providing two courses, a general and special, to be taught 
by foreign specialists. Agriculture was to be included among the sub- 
jects of instruction. General Kuroda, when in America, with the 
authority given him, employed as the commissioner and adviser of the 
colonial office Gen. Horace Capron, then United States Commissioner 
of Agriculture. The result was that not only American plants, animals, 
and machines were introduced, but General Capron urged the educa- 
tion in agriculture, and especially the establishment of a college of 
agriculture. This was so in accord with General Kuroda’s plan that 
General Capron’s recommendation was adopted, and Col. William Smith 
Clark, then president of the college of agriculture at Amherst, Mass., 
was selected for the task. The result of the movement thus begun is 
seen in the agricultural industries in every part of the realm. The 
college at Sapporo has furnished trained men for the promotion of every 
public and private interest. 
It is of interest to note that in 1891 there were in the university hall 
43, and a grand total in all departments of 1,304 students. In the ecol- 
lege of agriculture there were 228, There are two hospitals connected 
with the college of medicine. In astronomy a certain advantage is 
seeured by tracing back operations connected with astronomical obser- 
vations in the most ancient times. In 1888 a seismological observatory

was founded for the study of earthquake phenomena, Results of its 
work, of extreme interest, beautifully set forth, were exhibited at Chi- 
cago. Its several laboratories and opportunities for experimentation 
with plants and animals are extensive. The university library cofitains 
180,000 volumes, exclusive of 13,963 volumes belonging to the college 
of agriculture. It may be remarked here that in former times public 
libraries were most rare; the Government had certain large collections 
for the benefit of scholars, and feudal lords had libraries of their own. 
Under the new order Tokyo has led the way in the establishment of a 
public library, which in 1891 reported on its shelves 294,344 volumes, 
and during the year visitors to the number of 60,000, who used daily on 
an average over 1,000 volumes. Some nineteen other libraries, public 
and private, have sprung up in other parts of the Empire. The Impe- 
rial Museum has large collections, especially in natural history, and 
carries on a system of exchanges with other countries that has been 
especially helpful to progress in many directions. 
The Japanese early apprehended the relation of education to indus- 
try. The Tokyo technical school was established by the department 
‘of education in 1881 and designed to prepare persons as instructors in 
industrial schools and foremen or directors of manufactories. In 1890 
its courses were enlarged; an electrical section was added, and weaving 
was introduced into the section of dyeing, and special training was 
provided for those intending to be teachers of manual training in 
normal schools. The school is manned by an able corps.of well-trained 
teachers and is having great influence in promoting correct ideas in 
manual training in subordinate schools. The Tokyo music school was 
established in 1879, and Lowell Mason, of Boston, selected as instructor, 
and Japanese music was completely revolutionized, preserving what 
there was of special value in the old and introducing the best from 
other nations of the world. The unique art of Japan had reached a 
very high degree of excellence before the restoration, but began to lose 
its superiority under the influence of military commotions and of the 
high prices that inferior specimens commanded among foreign nations. 
Thoughtful minds apprehending the disadvantage of losing this supe- 
riority in art began in 1879 to organize instruction in painting and 
sculpture. This effort resulted in 1887 in the establishment of the 
Tokyo Fine Art School, with a general course of two years and a special 
course of three years, comprising painting, sculpture, architecture, and 
design. Its last report showed an attendance of 189. It is expected 
to do much in preparing teachers of drawing and of art. The speci- 
mens of work by its pupils exhibited at Chicago showed most encour- 
aging results and were greatly commended by the best judges. On the 
22d of May, 1875, five gentlemen, viz, Messrs. M. Furukawa, 8. Tsuda, 
M. Nakamura, G. Kisheda, and Dr. Burchardt, missionary of the Ger- 
man and American Lutheran Church, held a consultation at Dr. Henry 
Fauld’s house, Tokyo, on the subject of education for the blind, and
-P-A-G-E-1219
  
  EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1209 
organized a philanthropic society, which led to the foundation of a 
school for the blind and the dumb. The next year Mr. Y. Yamao, the 
senior vice-minister of public works, joined the society and objected to 
its dependence upon a foreign church for its support, and in accord- 
ance with his urgency those interested, whether native or foreign, 
regardless of religious differences, joined in the effort. The Emperor 
contributed 3,000 yen. The difficulties of overcoming the prejudices 
against educating these unfortunates were very great. At last two 
blind children and one dumb pupil were secured. An alphabet for the 
blind was devised, based on Braille’s system. In 1888 his excellency 
Arinori Mora, minister of state for education, visited the institution 
and gave it most emphatic public approval. The minister conferred 
the certificates, and in his remarks called to mind the neglect of the 
blind and the dumb in the past, and said to them: 
You must not be content with your present condition, but endeavor to advance 
your knowledge and skill with a view to the increase of your happiness; your pros- 
perity will not concern yourselves alone, but will not a little incite even those whose 
senses are complete to study and work. Thus your endeavors will be productive of 
good results in the education of the whole community. 
In 1892 there was an attendance of 92. 
The total expenditure for education for the year 1890, under the 
department of education, reached the sum of 1,284,960,471 yen. In 
all courses of instruction special emphasis is placed upon moral train- 
ing. The regulations for elementary education significantly declare 
that “the culture of the moral sensibilities should be chiefly attended 
to in the education of children.” It is added, “Hence in teaching any 
subject of study special attention should be paid to those topics that 
are connected with moral education and with education especially 
adapted to make of the children good members of the community.” 
The board of judges conferred upon the Japanese exhibit of education 
some thirty awards. 
There is in Japan an organization of learned men for the advance- 
ment of their national civilization known as the “Academy.” It was 
organized in 1879 and allowed to have 40 members. Now 15 are nomi- 
nated by the Emperor and 25 by the members, subject to the approval 
of the minister of education. ? 
There is also an educational society, dating back to 1870, with mem- 
bers numbering over 2,000, scattered over the Empire, ready to promote 
the progress of education. 
In addition to schools and educational activities under the direction 
of the department of education there are also important schools ‘for 
instruction under other departments. Under the imperial household 
department there is the school for the sons of nobles, on which there is 
an attendance of 660 pupils. There is also under the same department 
a school for the girls of the nobility, with an attendance of 364. Under 
the war department there are five schools for the instruction of officers 
 
-P-A-G-E-1220
  1210 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
and soldiers. In the naval department there are five schools also for 
the benefit of those in the naval service. The department of communi- 
cations has a nautical school and a school for instruction in telegraphy 
aud postal service. 
The Japanese woman’s commission, under the patronage of the 
Empress, with Princess Mori as chairman, were active in promoting a 
knowledge of the education of women: (1) Woman’s position in society; 
(2) in administration; (3) in literature; (4) in religion; (5) in the home, 
(a) child, (b) wife, (c) mother; (6) in industrial occupations, (a) agri- 
culture and sericulture, (>) handicrafts, (c) mercantile business; (7) in 
refined accomplishments, fine arts, music, painting, floral arrangements, 
incense and tea ceremonies; (8) woman’s work in the present period, 
or since 1868, charitable and female philanthropic work, ete. 
The university founded by Joseph Neesima has in connection with 
it a very prosperous school for nurses. 
TURKEY. 
Text-books from Turkey were brought to the attention of the board 
of judges of the liberal arts and were awarded recognition. They 
showed an attempt to adopt modern principles of education and modern 
methods of teaching. Turkey has a minister of public instruction. In 
1869 a school law was decreed containing the following provisions: (1) 
Each ward or village must have at least one primary school; in towns 
containing more than 500 houses, primary schools of a higher grade 
shall be established; (2) each town containing more than 1,000 houses 
must have a preparatory school or college, and the capital of each 
province must have a lyceum; (3) at Constantinople there shall be an 
imperial university and great council of education. ‘“ But these excel- 
lent legal provisions,” says an eminent authority, “have never been 
carried out, and neither new primary schools nor colleges nor lyceums 
haye been established.” There was both a lack of funds and compe- 
tent teachers. The difficulties in the way of educational progress are 
great; (1) the difference of race, (2) of creed, (3) of language, (4) the 
condition of woman, (5) the unnamed tradition which obstructs progress. 
The people are faced backward. The schools that exist to a certain 
extent are known as ward or district schools, where the teacher 
instructs in the Turkish alphabet and reads-the Koran in Arabic with 
his pupils, wko are supposed to remain with him five or six years and 
pay asmall fee. When pupils advance beyond this instruction they 
enter a higher grade, where they still pursue Turkish and take up the 
rudiments of arithmetic and the history of their country. This course 
lasts five or six years. Of a higher grade are the mosque schools, in 
which Turkish is continued, and Arabic, philosophy, theology, and his- 
tory are studied. Little or no attention is given to the natural sciences. 
The character of scientific information, when imparted at all, may be 
judged by the report of an eminent American, that ‘in connection
-P-A-G-E-1221
  EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1211 
with the application of electricity to telegraphy nothing was known of 
either Franklin or Morse.” It will be remembered that the Koran is 
the source both of civil and religious laws. The Koran, therefore, and 
its commentaries are the chief subjects of study, and much time is 
devoted to committing them to memory. 
There are certain special schools under the direction of the Govern- 
ment, such as the military academy, the naval academy, the artillery 
school, and the school of medicine. The Turkish language is so desti- 
tute of scientific terms that the French language is largely used in 
these schools. Latin scientific terms are also much employed. The 
Catholics established schools in Constantinople three centuries ago and 
they now maintain schools in many parts of the Empire. The Protest- 
ants have more recently established schools of great efficiency for both 
sexes. 
EGYPT. 
The schools of Egypt were represented by a single exhibitor, James 
Blackmore, of Cairo, The exhibit attracted marked interest. The 
material consisted mainly of text-books, the manuscript work of pupils 
in their native language, and in arithmetic and geography, together with 
specimens of manual training. Of course, with Mohammedans, the 
Koran takes the place of the Bible. Education encounters unnumbered 
obstacles. Egypt has in Cairo a university as old as the city. In 1302 
the building was greatly injured by an earthquake, but within the 
next two centuries was restored and enlarged. To describe its size it 
has been said that “on the 21st of October, 1798, when an insurrection 
broke out against the French, 15,000 insurgents took refuge within its 
walls and did not surrender until Napoleon brought artillery to bear 
upon them.” The object of the instruction is to make lawyers and 
theologians. There are four divisions or grades of study, the first 
two comprising grammar and syntax; the third, the doctrine of God 
and His attributes; the fourth, law, and consists in committing to 
memory commentaries of the Koran and the principles of jurisprudence. 
Besides these four essential studies there may be pursued rhetorié, 
prosody, logic, arithmetic, and mathematics. Recent Khedives have 
sought to establish effective systems of public instruction, seeking 
to introduce something from European and American improvements. 
A school of medicine, dating from 1827, which has had at times among 
its professors eminent European physicians, has done excellent service. 
There is connected with it a large hospital, a botanic garden, a library 
and a museum of anatomy and natural history, a school of pharmacy, 
and a chemical laboratory, in which medicines are prepared for the 
provinces. It has also a school for nurses, which gives to its students 
not only the special instruction required, but a more general education 
than is usually found among women of the East.
-P-A-G-E-1222
  1212 EDUCATION, REPORT, 1892-93. 
In 1868 the school law was thoroughly revised. Since then at differ- 
ent times education has received more efficient attention, and the Gov- 
ernment with reasonable exertion could have made a much more 
extensive and instructive exhibition at Chicago of public education. 
Rey. Horace Eaton, D. D., writing of his visit to Egypt, states that— 
The minister of education of Egypt seems to be sparing no pains to improve and 
extend education among the people. The higher departments in Cairo are directly 
under his inspection. His excellency, in person, favored the consul and myself with 
a visit to five departments. While they all study Arabic, mathematics, and philoso- 
phy, one class was reciting in German, another in French, and another in English. 
The sentences presented to us by the students in English were accurate and well 
written. Another class of young men was studying the laws of the country. The 
building used was convenient and inviting, surrounded with fountains and gardens. 
The departments visited were supported by the Khedive with the purpose of fitting 
students of the greatest promise to serve as engineers. 
The Copts maintain schools of their own, of different grades, in which 
the Bible is used instead of the Koran. They have schools for girls as 
well as for boys. The Jews also maintain a number of schools of their 
own. Efficient schools have been established by different churches, 
including the Greek, Roman Catholic, and Protestant. The Americans 
have schools at Cairo, Alexandria, Kous, and Mansurah, and two other 
points in the country. ‘ 
LIBERIA. 
The exhibition of education from this State was more significant in 
its absence than the collection it presented. In the main, the collections 
from the country either illustrated the conditions and characteristics 
of the natives or the industries and commerce of the negroes who had 
emigrated from America and the government they had established. 
There was much that was instructive in regard to the possibilities of 
the country, the richness of the soil, and the variety of tropical plants 
useful to man. Everything points to the néeds and character for 
development. Education should be the first consideration of every 
interest. 
Liberia, it will be remembered, is the only Christian negro State in 
Africa, and is situated on the grain and ivory coasts of Upper Guinea, 
between the parallels of 4° and 7° north latitude, extending along the 
Atlantic coast some 500 miles. The chief directory agency has been the 
American Colonization Society, with headquarters in Washington, 
D. C., which sought to provide for the negro a home, in a country where 
he could enjoy the privilege of full citizenship. The movement com- 
menced in 1822. In 1847 the national independence of its people, as a 
sovereign State, was acknowledged by leading nations. The Govern- 
ment is modeled after that of the United States. It provides for a 
system of public schools, crowned with a college or university. But 
education, unfortunately, has languished, as have some other elemen- 
tary interests in the foundation of a stable, prosperous, and free gov-
-P-A-G-E-1223

ernment. Good roads have not been provided. The means of adapta- 
tion to the climate and other conditions of the country have not been 
sufficiently studied to assure comfort, health, prosperous industry, and 
the development of higher personal, social, and civil life. Many who 
have come to the country were not able or sufficiently intelligent to 
maintain a higher order of life from the homes from which they came, 
surrounded by the conditions of civilization. 
In spite of these adverse facts, not a few have come to the front as 
worthy leaders, and what has been accomplished in it has much of 
promise. The American Colonization Society in its activities, under 
its secretary, Hon. J. Ormond Wilson, who became widely known as 
the wise and successful upbuilder and superintendent of the system of 
free schools in the District of Columbia, has changed its policy. It 
now seeks to aid Liberia in cooperating along lines having in them the 
greatest possibility of improvement. It sends out few emigrants, and 
only those prepared to be good citizens and contribute to the highest 
welfare of their adopted country, persons of intelligence and means, 
skillful in the common industries, or physicians and teachers. The 
society is seeking especially to cooperate with the Government in revis- 
ing the school system, in securing appropriate sites and houses, good 
and uniform text-books at reasonable rates, and efficient and faithful 
teachers. The bulletin published by the society is full of valuable 
information, both for Liberia and the formation of correct opinions by 
its friends. 
THE DOMINION OF CANADA. 
The colonies in forming the Dominion of Canada retained their own 
educational autonomy. The Dominion Government attempts no author- 
ity over them in matters of education. A single fact is the source of 
great embarrassment in the Province of Quebec. The scheme of edu- 
cation, instead of being managed by civil administration irrespective of 
denominational creeds, is divided between Roman Catholics and Prot- 
estants. Each has, for instance, a separate public-school system of its 
own The school tax levied on the property of Catholics is expended in 
the support of schools managed by a Catholic board of education, taught 
by Catholic teachers, and attended by Catholic pupils. The same is 
true of Protestants. Another embarrassment arises from the-use of 
two languages, French and English. 
The education of Ontario has attracted more attention than that of 
any other Province. The conspicuous figure and hero of its early strug- 
gles, as well as of its later triumphs, was Rev. Edgerton Ryerson, 
LL. D., so long the chief educational officer of the Province. Elemen- 
tary schools were put on a comprehensive basis in 1844, The chief 
educational officer has been known as winister of education since 1876. 
The present minister is Hon. George W. Ross, LL. D. Dr. Ryerson’s 
deputy and life-long friend and coadjutor was Hon. John George Hod-

gins, M. A., LL. D., barrister at law, greatly honored in Canada and the 
United States, who still survives and oceupies in the department the 
post of librarian and historiographer. Dr. Ryerson acted on the theory 
that nothing was too good for Ontario schools; that they deserved the 
best to be found anywhere. Asa result, it may be said, in the language 
of the deputy minister, that— 
From the State of New York Ontario borrowed the machinery of their schools; 
from Massachusetts the system of local taxation; from Ireland their first series of 
text-books; from Scotland the cooperation of the parents with the teacher, in uphold- 
ing his authority; from Germany the system of normal schools and the kindergarten; 
and from the United States generally the undenominational character of elementary, 
secondary, and university education. 
General and local authority work-in harmony; the several grades are clearly 
defined, especially the relations of the high schools to the university; teachers are 
professionally trained; no person can be an inspector or superintendent who has not 
had experience as a teacher, and does not hold a high-grade certificate; inspectors 
removable if inefficient, but subject to removal by popular vote; the examinations 
of teachers under provincial instead of local control; the acceptance of a common 
matriculation examination for admittance to the universities and to the learned pro- 
fessions; a uniform series of text-books for the whole Province. 
The kindergarten is now a part of the public system, There is no 
established church in Ontario or connection between church and state. 
No religious body has any voice in the management of the high and 
publie schools or the university. These institutions are far from being 
Godless or irreligious. Though not denominational, they are institu- 
tions of a Christian people. The doctrines of no church are taught, but 
the principles of Christianity form an essential feature of the daily 
exercises. The teachers are, with very rare exceptions, men and women 
of high moral character. Regulations of the education department 
provide that— 
(1) Every school should be opened with the Lord’s Prayer and closed with the 
reading of the Scriptures and the Lord’s Prayer or the prayer authorized by the 
department; (2) the Scriptures shall be read daily and systematically and without 
comment; (3) trustees may order the reading of the Bible or the authorized selec- 
tions by both teachers and pupils at the opening and the closing of the school, and 
the repeating of the Ten Commandments at least once a week; (4) no pupil shall 
be required to take part in any religious exercise objected to by his parents or 
guardian; (5) absence during the religious exercises is not treated as an offense, 
It is assumed that the parent as well as the State has duties to per- 
form regarding education. It is held to be the duty of the State to 
provide free elementary schools, and that eompulsory education is a 
necessary corollary of free education. If the State gives the boon of 
free education to all it has a right to see that the expected advantages 
are realized. Attendance is enforced between the ages of 8.and 14; 
the rights of conscience are guarded. Penalties are not inflicted if the 
child is under efficient private instruction or unable to attend through 
sickness or other unavoidable cause. A penalty of $20 is imposed 
upon any person employing a child under 14 years of age during scheol 
hours: but if the services of a child are urgent he may be excused six

weeks of aterm. Vicious or immoral children are sent to an indus- 
trial school. Truant officers must be appointed in every city and 
village and may be for every school section. Truant officers must 
report annually to the department of education. The friends of the 
public schools endeavor to preserve them free from partisan influences. 
Already 66 kindergartens, with an attendance of 6,375 pupils, are 
reported. The population of Ontario is reported as 2,114,321, and the 
school population as 615,781, and the pupils enrolled 491,741. Certain 
educational privileges were guaranteed Roman Catholics by the act of 
confederation, and they may establish what are known as separate 
schools. This may be done also by the Protestants and for colored per- 
sons. Two hundred and eighty-nine separate schools are reported in 
the Province. Two public normal schools are maintained, one in 
Toronto and the other in Ottawa, each having a model or practice 
school associated with it. There is also a so-called school of pedagogy 
in Toronto. For thirty years the teachers’ institutes have been noted 
for their efficiency. Thorough school inspection is an important factor 
in educational progress. The education department, in addition to the 
general care of education, is authorized to manage and inspect me- 
chanics’ institutes, libraries, reading reoms, evening classes, and art 
schools. There are reported to be in these libraries 426,966 volumes. 
MEXICO. 
Our opinions of Mexico, our near neighbor, suffer from inadequate or 
inaccurate information. The Mexican exhibit at Chicago furnished a 
rare opportunity for obtaining full and accurate data upon the most 
important topics concerning that very interesting country. <A large 
amount of literature was distributed, private and official. The fact 
that most of it was in the Spanish language was a bar to its use to 
those who knew only English. Many of the books were gotten up, 
printed, illustrated, and bound in the highest style of the printer’s art. 
There were treatises embodying the most thorough scientific investiga- 
tions into the geography, geology, mineralogy, and other features of 
the natural history of the country. There were many evidences that 
the General Government and that of some of the States are laying 
under contribution the most advanced scientific research and experi- 
ments to promote the advancement of the interests of the people. The 
ancient history of the country has long been the subject of speculation. 
It is authoritatively stated that it had at the time of the conquest over 
30,000,000 of people and that within a period of thirty-six years from 
that date 3,500,000 of the native inhabitants died, and that this 
depopulation went on at such a rate that by the year 1793 the popula- 
tion of New Spain, so called, “scarcely amounted to 3,865,499.” The 
total population by the last census is given as 11,834,822, The censuses 
are believed not to be free from imperfections. From official data it 
appears that from the years 1852 to 1862 the population increased at — 
 
-P-A-G-E-1226
1216 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  the rate of 9.58 per cent; from 1862 to 1872, 8.34 per cent; from 1872 
to 1882, 9.94 per cent; from 1882 to 1892, 18.29 per cent. The Federal 
District, or capital, has 329,535 inhabitants. A geographical subdi- 
vision of population is made as follows: The Pacific States, 4,023,376; 
the Gulf States, 1,322,649; the Middle States, including the Federal 
District, 5,564,845; the States of the North, 923,952. Under the head 
of “races” an official authority remarks: 
‘The present predominating race in Mexico is not the Indian, as in the times pre- 
vious to the conquest, nor the Spanish race, as in the time of government by viceroys, 
nor even the creole, as in the first years of independence, but a people springing 
from the commingling of the blood of the Spanish and American. The European 
and Indian have amalgamated to such an extent that comparatively few of the dis- 
tinct races excel in Mexico. Very few Europeans become naturalized citizens of the 
country, and as for the Indians, they live in nearly absolute independence, as is the 
case with those who inhabit the mountains of Chiapas and Oaxaca; the one in a semi- 
barbaric, the other in a secluded manner, either in a lamentable and fallen state, as 
in the central table-lands, or next to the barbaric, as in Sonora and Chihuahua. The 
Indians, by virtue of their endowments received, are preeminent in aptitude for any 
kind of accomplishment, and will not separate themselves from their tribal customs 
to join in the general movement of progress and civilization and the uniting of their 
race with the moreintelligent one. The Spanish-American, which forms an energetic 
race, improved by amalgamation, has preserved much of the Indian tenacity, endur- 
ance in adversity, and their war spirit and inclination to strife; while from the 
Spaniards he has derived his mental qualifications, and a restless, chivalrous spirit, 
with not a little of his lack of practical commonsense. The mixed race are the man- 
agers of the industries, directors of the finances, and form the chief portion of the tax 
paying class of Mexico. The Indian, stupefied and discouraged by the oppression of 
the Spaniard, and degenerated by superstition, still finds himself unable to shake off 
the inertia, which has had its consuming effect, not for the want of intellectual 
capacities, but because the race is weighted down with two great elements of degener- 
ation, viz, oppression and fanaticism, which prevent it from rising above its degraded 
condition. 
The horde of semibarbarians of Yucatan are obedient to only two motives—hate 
and detestation for the white race and love of the priests. Notwithstanding this, it 
would be ridiculous at the present day to enter into a discussion as to the capacity 
of the Indians to ‘‘ conceive abstract ideas,” as in the time of Robertson, or to dis- 
cuss their ‘‘strength and resistance,” as in that of Dr. Benito Maria Moxo, which 
were hardly conceded. But such subjects are not worthy to occupy too much atten- 
tion from intelligent persons. There is scarcely in existence one solitary individual 
possessor of rudimentary ethnical knowledge who would dare to doubt the moral 
gifts of the Indian or his physical resistance The Indian, as a soldier, is sufficiently 
known to European nations, and in order to form an idea of his moral gifts it is suf- 
ficient to read the story of Juarez, Ramirez, Altamirano, and many others whose 
names have been, and will continue to be, handed down on the brightest page of 
history. 
Until now we have considered the Indian by comparison in the light of two 
extremes, from the highest grade of intelligence to that of the barbaric; we have 
also spoken of the degenerate Indian; and we will now consider him as one joined 
to civilization, that is to say, regenerated or become amalgamated with the pre- 
dominant race. The Indian, in order to attain the civilization of his more fortunate 
neighbor, has two roads before him—the army and the workshop. The army is a 
school and ladder for the Indian; the school where he can obtain arudimentary edu- 
cation to place him on the road to securing higher positions among the Spanish-

American element; therefore incidentally it may be stated that so long as there 
exists so large a number of Indians in Mexico the reduction of the army, of which 
so much has been said, would be a censurable measure. 
Besides the army the Indian has another road to civilization—industry. In the 
factories and workshops he is placed in contact with the active and intelligent ele- 
ments, and will ere long receive the benefits of the stimulus; he commences in his 
new position by abandoning his dress, which is only so in name, and adopting thas. 
of the Spanish-American, finally acquiring intelligence and development of his. 
moral faculties. 
The Spanish-American, to which race belongs the greater portion of the public 
functionaries and literary men of Mexico, has succeeded, after the most energetic 
efforts and with the material aid of the native Indian element, in reconstructing 
the national character, binding together all its parts, fusing its dissolvent elements — 
in a common mass, and inspiring in all classes, with the love of country, the spirit. 
of true progress. 
Of the 11,395,712 inhabitants an official authority designates 2,165,- 
185, or 19 per cent, as European and Spanish-American; 4,330,371, or 38 
per cent, as Indian; and 4,900,156, or 43 per cent, as “mixed.” Thelaws. 
are favorable to immigration, but the frequently disturbed condition of 
the country has not attracted foreigners. Foreign capital, however, 
has made large investments in mines, railroads, and other internal 
improvements, greatly to the advantage of the country. 
In 1874 complete separation of church and state was declared. The 
ministers of any religion do not by reason of their character or profes- 
sion enjoy any privilege that would distinguish them from any other 
citizens, nor are they subject to greater prohibitions than those designed 
in the constitution. Morality is taught in national establishments 
without alluding to any special religion. No religious ceremony is 
permitted to be performed in public, but only in the interior of the 
churches, and these must be public. Members of any religious denomi- 
nation are forbidden to wear any dress to distinguish them from other 
citizens, Asa result of the bloody conflicts through which the country 
has come, the Government seized the property of monastic orders and 
will not now allow their establishment, whatever may be their purpose. 
It has been declared that the most obstinate resistance to the necessary 
enlightenment of the people arises from superstitious beliefs which they 
have accepted as religious. In the main, the officers of the Government. 
are adherents to the Roman Catholic Church. The first so-called Prot- 
estant church dates its organization back to 1869. These churches are 
now reported to have 16,250 communicants and probably 49,512 adher- 
ents. They report 7 theological schools, with 88 students; 23 boarding 
schools and orphanages, with 715 pupils; 164 common schools, with 
6,533 pupils. Sunday schools are said to have an attendance of over 
10,000, There are 5 publishing houses, from which are issued 11 papers. 
All these efforts are in hearty sympathy with the efforts of the Gen- 
eral Government and of the several States to establish efficient systems. 
of public instruction.

  1218 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
The first law in regard to public education appeared the 30th of 
October, 1833; further action was taken in 1834, 1843, 1846, 1854, and. 
1855. In 1861 a law was passed upon public instruction under the 
department of justice. On the reestablishment in 1869 in the city of 
Mexico of the constitutional Government, education, which had reached. 
a most deplorable condition, began to receive new and more vigorous 
attention. New opportunities were opened for women, and primary 
instruction was made obligatory in the Federal District and territories. 
Still more definite and effective legislation was had in 1888, In the 
following year the minister of justice organized a congress of educa- 
tion, to be composed of eminent educators, including representatives 
from the different States appointed by their respective governors. 
This congress was found so effective in harmonizing views, adminis- 
tration, and legislation, and in awakening interest in the public mind 
in the establishment of schools and the instruction of youth, that other 
congresses have followed, each doing, if possible, more effective work 
than its predecessor. It is impossible to deseribe the difficulties 
encountered. The most rudimentary steps were necessary. In gen- 
eral it was agreed that every means should be adopted to establish 
schools and improve instruction, alike for girls and boys. The scholas- 
tic year was. to consist of ten months, beginning on the 7th of January; 
the scholastic week of five days beginning Monday and closing Friday. 
The instruction was to include the practical duties of the man, the 
woman, and the citizen; reading and writing the national language; 
arithmetic; the rudiments of the natural seiences, of geography, and 
of national history; practical notions of geometry; drawing; sketching 
of common and simple objects; singing; gymnastics and military exer- 
cises; manual training adapted to boys and to girls. Local commit- 
tees are organized in different sections tosee that the law is carried out 
by parents, teachers, and children. To stimulate teachers prizes are 
offered for specially meritorious efforts. Meantime the General Gov- 
ernment, in meeting the great demands upon scientific knowledge in the 
discharge of its duties to the people in the military, naval, and civil 
service, has organized schools of medicine; of engineering in all its 
departments; of agriculture and veterinary surgery; of commerce and 
administration; of arts and trades for men and for women; of fine arts, 
ineluding painting, sculpture, and engraving, and a conservatory of 
musie, A school for deaf-mutes was established in the City of Mexico 
in 1866 and one for the blind in 1870. A school of jurisprudence or 
law was opened in 1868, with a six years’ course. In 1885 a normal 
school for the training of teachers for the elementary schools was estab- 
lished under the immediate charge of the department of justice and 
public instruction. A four years’ course was provided and experience 
in practice schools was required. Here a knowledge of kindergarten 
principles and methods may be obtained. The model school for pre- 
ceptors, established in 1887, receives from the Government an annual

allowance of over $60,000, and has already become well known for its 
efficiency; prizes are offered to stimulate the preparation for teaching. 
In the libraries at the capital, which are supported by the Federal Goy- 
ernment, there are eported 220,538 volumes, of which 159,000 are in the 
national library. Twenty literary and scientific societies are reported 
in the Federal District. Attention was given to the establishment of 
museums as early as 1786, but interest so languished thatlittle remains 
of them. The national museum, however, has been reorganized on an 
efficient basis, and now receives $12,000 annually for its support. In 
archeology Mexico has done much to attract the admiration of 
scholars in all countries. There are reported 390 periodic publications 
in the entire Republic. For 1892, $206,000 were expended for public 
instruction in the City of Mexico and 21,159 pupils were enrolled. 
Statistics of public instruction are lacking from four of the States, but 
in those reporting there were in 1890 enrolled 221,952 males and 104,945 
females, or a total of 326,897. 
Some twenty awards were bestowed on group 149, A considerable 
number were given to schools that exhibited photographs of their build- 
ings, grounds, and appliances, and the work of their pupils, and were 
distributed among different States, as well as in the Federal District. 
Some were given on reports and statistics; others on school furniture; 
most were bestowed for the excellence of school work. Specimens of 
drawing in crayon and with pencil and specimens of penmanship 
attracted especial attention. 
BRAZIL. 
Brazil erected an imposing representative building, and oceupied in 
different departments important space with industrial and commercial 
exhibits, but the representation of education was inadequate both in 
educational, literary, and illustrative articles. Indeed, comparatively 
few visitors were able, from information obtainable on the grounds, to 
form any definite idea of what is accomplished in that country for the 
advancement of the intelligence of its people. A national museum of 
natural history was established in Rio as early as 1817. Others of like 
character are found in Paré, Ceara, Ouropreto. The national library 
in Rio numbers over 100,000 volumes. The college at Rio numbers 22 
professors. Considerable attention is paid to military education. The 
Central College has 11 professors, devoted to higher branches of mili- 
tary science and engineering. There is also an astronomical observa-_ 
tory associated with it. There are two faculties of medicine, one at Rio 
and another at Bahia. There are faculties of law at Sao, Paulo, and 
Recife. There is a commercial institute at Rio. There is also an insti- 
tution for the blind and deaf and dumb. Rio has also an academy of 
fine arts and a conservatory of music. Each of the several States car- 
ries on a system of public education, including elementary and second- 
ary schools. There are many private schools, especially small ones,

of great merit. The Province or State of Ceara, where the inhabitants 
in 1890 numbered 757,662, numbered according to the latest reports in 
its schools for primary and secondary instruction 4,443 boys and 4,546 
girls. Ceara maintains a normal school. 
URUGUAY. 
* The Republic of Uruguay made an exhibit of education in the agri- 
cultural building. There were collected text-books used in different 
grades of instruction, specimens of school furniture, seats and desks, 
and illustrations of the apparatus used, and the pupils’ work. The 
exhibition was not large, but showed with what intelligence and zeal 
the people are striving to meet the difficulties in the way of universal 
education. Among the important agencies employed for the dissemina- 
tion of correct ideas is a pedagogical museum. In this an effort is 
made to show the importance in appliances used in other countries. 
Already education has been declared free and attendance compulsory. 
The children of school age are reported as 5.4 per cent of the total pop- 
ulation, or about 30,000. Public schools are by law unsectarian. The 
best methods of organization and instruction are slowly making their 
way among the people. Advanced education is very limited. A uni- 
versity was founded at Montevideo in 1838, Much good has been 
accomplished by it, but the instruction has not reached the high grade 
found in the universities of Europe or in the United States. As high 
“a number as 1,300 students have been reported in attendance. There 
is also a well-known school of arts and trades. 
ARGENTINE REPUBLIC. 
The visit to this country of Sarmiento, the enlightened and aistin- 
guished Argentine statesman, created an interest in the education of 
his country which has by no means disappeared from the American 
mind. He apprehended the importance of the careful training of the 
oung to the establishment and perpetuity of free institutions. No. 
South American statesman ever did more for the training of the youth 
of his country. There was not a little disappointment that the present 
condition of Argentine education was not fully represented at Chicago. 
The period of the Government neglect of public education in that coun- 
try is astriking illustration of the opportunity furnished by the igno- 
rance of the people for the reign of tyranny and terror. Whatever 
stability and prosperity have come to that country may be traced to the 
efforts to train children in virtue, intelligence, and industry. The most 
satisfactory information obtainable at Chicago in regard to Argentine 
education was that furnished in reference to secondary instruction in 
national colleges and normal schools. The course in the national col- 
leges embraces five years. For the first year Spanish, practical arith- 
metic, geography, history, French. The second year Spanish, arithme. 
tic, Latin, history (ancient), geography, French. Third year Spanish,
-P-A-G-E-1231
  EDUCATION AT THE COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION. 1221 
- Latin, history (Europe, middle ages), geography (Europe, physical and 
political), algebra, fundamental rules, plane geometry (first six books 
of Euclid), French (reviewing of grammar and reading), English (gram- 
mar and composition). Fourth year Spanish, elements of rhetoric and 
forms of literary productions, notions of etymology (formation of the 
Neo-Latin languages), Latin (Livy, Sallust, and Cicero), history (America 
at the time of discovery and the wars of independence), solid geometry, 
physies, mechanical forces, natural history (zoology), philosophy (psy- 
chology), English, reading and composition. Fifth year, Spanish (his- 
torical view of the language, literary movement in Spanish-American 
countries), Latin (Cicero and Horace), civil government (Argentine 
constitution compared with that of the United States), physics (light, 
electricity, acoustics), cosmography (historic), history (French revolu- 
tion, Germany, unification of Italy, intellectual movement), Argentine 
history (colonial), viceroyalty, the Republic, era of anarchy, tyranny 
of Rosas, organization of the Republic, chemistry (inorganic and 
organic), natural history (vegetable anatomy and physiology), geology 
(constitution of our globe), mineralogy, grouping of mineral substances, 
philosophy (logic), ethics (duties and rights), English (study of special 
authors). It is complained that since 1863 the plan of study has suf- 
fered eight modifications, and that now Latin is compulsory from the 
second to the fifth year. As in other national establishments of edu- 
cation, no system of religion is taught, butan important place is assigned 
to instruction in morality. Candidates for admission must have com- 
pleted their twelfth year. Sixteen national colleges are reported with 
2,604 pupils in attendance, costing annually $685,980. In addition to 
the national colleges, private colleges may be incorporated by com- . 
plying with certain specified conditions. There are 17 of these col- 
leges reported with an attendance varying from 28 to 500. The plan 
of a national college includes a library. The number of volumes in 
these libraries has reached 36,788. Much pains is taken to furnish the 
colleges with maps and charts, laboratories, and museums. They are 
all under the supervision of the inspector-general, who has two assist- 
ants, and reports to the minister of public instruction. Great interest 
is manifested in the introduction of manual training into the course of 
instruction of these institutions. 
NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
Sarmiento in 1868, when he returned from North America to oceupy 
the Presidency of the Republic, established the normal school at 
Parama. Mr, George Stearns, a New England teacher, became its 
principal. There are now 13 normal schools for males with an attend- 
ance of 3,130, and 14 normal schools for females with an attendance of 
3,837, and there are 7 mixed normal schools with an attendance of 250 
in the normal courses. Normal schools are of two classes, those of the 
lower grade with a three years’ course, and those of the higher with a
-P-A-G-E-1232
1222 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
five years’ course. In the male normal schools there is military drill; in 
the girls’ normal school there are courses in sewing and domestic 
economy. There were in 1892 6 kindergartens attached to as many 
normal schools. The first was opened at Parama in 1883, under Mrs. 
Eccleston, from the United States. In 1890 a national school of com- 
merce was established, whose graduates are given preference in the 
public service. . : 2 
. HAITI. 
There was peculiar interest attached to the presence of Haiti in the 
World’s Columbian Exposition at the four hundredth anniversary of 
the discovery of the American continent by Columbus. The Govern- 
ment erected on the grounds a pavilion of merit as a general ren- 
dezvous for its visiting citizens, and occupied space with interesting 
exhibits in the departments of agriculture, mines and mining, forestry, 
and others. : 
Inquiries for education were only answered by a very brief and 
inadequate statement, made by the secretary of state, for public instruc- 
tion, which contained a general description of the condition of affairs 
in the Republic of Haiti in the year 1892. The data contained in this 
report showed a condition of things far from encouraging to the friends 
of education. Educational expenditures were inadequate, schools were 
not sufficient in number, teachers were not well qualified, attendance 
was limited and irregular. 
Those among the leaders of the people who are seeking to promote 
the best things in education are at great disadvantage. The people 
generally must become more deeply interested in intelligence and 
virtue before their Republic can expect that prevalence of law, order, 
and prosperity which gives stability to government. 
It was a fact of great promise that the Hon. Frederick Douglass, late 
United States minister to Haiti, was selected by that Government as 
its representative to the exposition, He was the most conspicuous 
representative of what the colored man may attain. When he spoke, 
he voiced not only the possibilities of Haiti, but of the colored race. 
NEW SOUTH WALES. 
The educational exhibit of New South Wales deserves special atten- 
tion. The literature was abundant. One could learn all about that 
distant country, its geology, mineralogy, geography, and meteorology; 
all about its government, its people, and their pursuits, and the provi- 
sion for culture during school period and afterwards. Nothing appeared 
to be overlooked or left out. Here were school laws, school reports, 
general and special, such as that on technical education, and that on 
lighting, heating, and ventilating of school buildings. The last was 
made to the legislative assembly, and contained a survey of these sub- 
jects in Great Britain, on the Continent of Europe, and in America,

thus making clear that the educational experience of the world is laid 
under contribution for the benefit of education in the colony. The 
public system of instruction is administered under a central office, 
which was set forth in detail. The colony is appropriately subdivided, 
and the schools aré carefully graded from the university downward to 
the kindergarten. These grades were carefully set forth by systems of 
classification, views of grounds, buildings, and the specimens it has, 
and appliances connected with each grade, and the school work of the 
same, both from country and city, all carefully catalogued. There 
were 4 views of the technical college and 12 of common public school 
buildings and specimens of pupils’ work from 574 public schools. 
The first class for technical education in the colony was held at the 
Sydney Mechanics’ School of Arts, 1865. There is now a technical 
college, located at-Oltimo, with a large number of branch schools in 
other considerable centers of population, and the whole is under the 
ministry, supervised by a superintendent of technical education, and 
the number of individual students enrolled in 1892 was 8,329, 
Specimens of their work were exhibited in architecture, carpentry, 
eabinetmaking, sanitary plumbing, masonry, stone and marble cary- 
ing, in masonry drawing, mechanical drawing, pattern making, iron 
founding, boiler making, fitting’ and turning, and coach building, in 
modeling, photolithography, industrial art, caligraphy, and phonog- 
raphy. The Technological Museum contains 9,000 specimens, and a 
large number of these were on exhibition, carefully catalogued, with 
illustrations of economical application, including foods, medicines, and 
specifying resins, gums, barks, fibers, and galls. There were great 
numbers of specimens of wool, both for educational and commercial 
purposes. The work done for the deaf and blind was illustrated by 
photographs of the blind, by statistical reports, and specimens of the 
work done by the pupils. There were 7 photographs of the Uni- 
versity of Sydney, which received the royal assent the 1st of Octo- 
ber, and declares its object to be the advancement of religion and 
morality and the promotion of useful knowledge. It has buildings on 
a site allotted by the government which cost $1,000,000, and includes 
scientific laboratories and museums equipped with all modern appli- 
ances. In 1892 it had 14 professors and 40 lecturers and demonstra- 
tors and 598 students in attendance, including 99 women. There are 
4 affiliated colleges. There was a large number of specimens exhib- 
ited from the collections in the museum of the university. The free 
public library contained 97,349 volumes, and its visitors are carefully 
reported, as are those to the museum and the national gallery of art. 
The total enrollment of pupils in 1892 was 210,641. 
Kindergarten‘is now taught in all the training classes. Cookery and 
needle instruction for girls and manual training for boys are increas- 
ingly demanded. ‘The legal school age is 4 to 14, An arbor day is 
extensively observed,

A considerable number of eyening schools are maintained. There. 
are reported so-called house-to-house schools. These are composed of 
the children of famihes residing in localities several miles apart. Each 
locality forms a teaching station or house-to-house school, and the. 
teacher journeys from station to station and collects.as many children 
as possible at a central point. The instruction is confined to reading, 
writing, and arithmetic.. Every teacher is required to supplement his 
oral instruction by a system of instruction of home lessons. Unless 
this portion of his duties were faithfully attended to much of his time 
and teaching would be wasted. . mS ev: @

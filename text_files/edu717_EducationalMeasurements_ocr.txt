EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENTS 
CHAPTER I 
INTRODUCTION 
Ir is undoubtedly premature to write a book on educational 
measurements, because most of the measurements are in the experi- 
mental stage. There are, however, several reasons which more than 
offset this situation. In the first place, the need of definite, objec- 
tive measures of educational products is so great and the usefulness 
of the present available standard tests has been so generally demon- 
strated that a means of making the tests and scales more widely 
accessible is entirely justifiable. Second, the very fact that many 
of the tests are in the experimental stage is a reason for making them 
more generally available, so that they may be rectified, improved 
and extended through broader codperation of educators over the 
entire country. Third, it is hoped that more general application 
of educational measurements will create a deeper scientific interest 
in educational matters. 
The current movement for measuring school products is one of 
the three or four most important fields of investigation in the scien- 
tific study of educational problems. Very material progress has 
been made during the last half a dozen years in the endeavor to 
devise accurate methods for measuring the actual achievements of 
pupils in school studies, so that we now have fairly accurate tests 
and scales for measuring attainment in most of the elementary schools 
studies and in several high school subjects. 
It is unnecessary to point out the scientific and practical value of 
such investigations for all who are connected with the schools — 
administrators, supervisors, teachers, pupils and students of edu- 
cational problems. These tests will furnish tools for evaluating 
quantitatively the results of methods and factors in teaching and 
B I

learning, and for examining various aspects of efficiency of instruc- 
tion and administration of school systems. 
It is unnecessary to make a defense of aubucetapeal measurements 
in the presence of intelligent persons who have a genuine scientific 
interest in the education of mankind. There are those who say 
that the real results of education are too subtle and too evasive to be 
measurable by any sort of quantitative tests. The only reply to 
offer is that we are making such measurements all the time by the 
millions of school marks assigned every year and by all the com- 
parative judgments of human qualities as better or worse, as greater 
or less, as more useful or less useful, which we are so free to make 
not only in educational affairs but in all phases of human activity. 
The sole purpose of standardized measurements is to refine these 
judgments, to make them more accurate and objective, ‘to express 
them in terms of known units of a definable character, so that we 
may be able to say, for example, that a pupil can read three words 
per second of a certain passage and to report so and so much of it, 
that he knows the English meaning of 2000 Latin words and can 
translate without error sentences of specified difficulty. 
If there are any products or by-products of education which are 
too subtle to be distinguished or judged as existing in greater or less 
amounts, or as having higher or lower quality, we may be suspicious 
of their actual existence. Any quality or ability of human nature 
that is detectable is also measurable. It remains only to discover 
more and more accurate means of measurement. 
What we need more than anything else in teaching and in the 
administration of public schools is scientific method and caution 
in handling the problems confronted. Educators must instill into 
themselves the scientific point of view in looking at their problems. 
The old-time pedagogy is passing away ; quantitative studies, objec- 
tive measurements, and carefully observed facts are taking its place. 
The next great forward step in education will come when competent 
educators will use the schools as laboratories for legitimate experi- 
mentation conducted according to scientific procedure.

  CHAPTER II 
MARKS AS MEASURES OF SCHOOL WORK 
Marks are the universal measures of school work. Numerous 
and momentous problems in the operation of a school depend upon 
them, such as promotion, retardation, elimination, honors, eligibility 
for contests and societies, graduation, admission to higher institu- 
tions, recommendations for future positions and the like. Until a 
decade ago, no one questioned either the validity or the fairness of 
these measurements. It was tacitly assumed that marks were al- 
most absolutely correct, or very nearly so, a fact attested by the 
surprisingly common practice of marking to the fractional part of 
a point even on a 100 percentage basis. 
If we consider marks from a scientific viewpoint as a measur- 
ing scale, three fundamental questions arise: (1) How fine a scale 
of units.may be used satisfactorily? (2) How reliable are the 
ratings made on the particular scale adopted? (3) How shall the 
marks be distributed? That is, How frequently m.the long run 
shall each unit on the scale be assigned? The second problem 
will be taken up first. In order to show precisely the accuracy, 
or rather the inaccuracy, of marks, the following investigation will 
be cited. fT 
: The Reliability of Marks 
The Reliability of Marks in the Case of English. The recent 
studies of grades have emphatically directed our attention to the 
wide variation and the utter absence of standards in the assign- 
ment of values. Dearborn pointed out in his investigation the 
large inequalities in the standards of grading employed by different 
teachers. Of two instructors in the same department one gave to 
43 per cent of his students the grade of “excellent ’ and to none 
the grade of “ failure,” whereas the other gave to none of his stu- 
dents the grade of ‘excellent ’’ and to 14 per cent the grade of 
“ failure.”
-P-A-G-E-12
4 EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENTS 
Finkelstein made a comparison of the marks assigned to the 
students in a course which was in charge of one instructor during 
the first semester and in charge of another instructor during the 
second semester, the students remaining the same throughout the 
year. The distribution of the marks was as follows: Exempt 
from ex- amina- 
0-59 60-69 70-79 80-89 90-160 tion 
1st instructor 9.5 25.5 3233) 26.6 6.1 12.5 
2d instructor 35 24.9 34.1 43-7 3.8 37-7 
Such wide differences are no doubt due in part to a difference in 
the students and in the nature of the work, but largely to a differ- 
ence in the standards of marking. 
In order to determine precisely the personal equation in evalu- 
ating the work of pupils, it is necessary to eliminate all variable 
elements, such as difference in amount and kind of work covered 
by the class, emphasis upon different topics, differences in teaching 
ability and differences in the pupils themselves. 
An investigation was made to determine the range of variation 
and the reliability of the marks assigned by different teachers to 
the same papers. Two examination-answer papers, written by two 
pupils at the end of the first year’s work in English, in high school, 
were reprinted by plates, so that the handwriting, the errors and 
changes made by the pupils, the neatness, etc., were reproduced 
exactly as in the original papers. These two papers were marked 
carefully by one hundred and forty-two teachers of first-year 
English according to the practices and standards of their respective 
schools. ‘ 
The grades assigned by the one hundred and forty-two teachers 
are represented by accompanying distribution charts. The range 
of marks is indicated along the base line of each chart and the num- 
ber of times each grade was given is indicated by the number of 
dots above that grade. Thus in Fig. 1 grade 80 was given by five 
teachers and grade 81 by eight teachers. The marks for one paper, 
paper A, are given in Fig. 1 and those for the other paper, paper B, 
are given in Fig. 2. 
The first and most startling fact brought out by this investiga- 
tion is the tremendously wide range of variation. It is almost
-P-A-G-E-13
MARKS AS MEASURES OF SCHOOL WORK 5 
shocking to a mind of no more than ordinary exactness to find that 
the range of marks given by different teachers to the same paper 
may be as large as 35 or 4o points. 
Nineteen teachers marked paper A 80 or lower and fourteen

Fic. 1.— Paper A. Passing grade 75. Median 88.2. Probable error 4.0. Marks assigned

teachers in schools whose passing grade was 70 were on the average one point lower. 
marked it 95 or higher. Eighteen teachers marked paper B 70 or 
lower and fourteen marked it 90 or higher. 
The two papers, A and B, were marked 80 and 75 respectively 
by the teacher under whom the pupils had taken the course. The 
passing grade in this school was 70. 
  50 60. 65 70 #75 80 95 
Fic. 2.— Paper B. Passing grade 75. Median 80.2. Probableerror 4.8. Marks assigned 
by schools whose passing grade was 70 were weighted by two points since the marks assigned by 
teachers in schools whose passing grade was 70 were on the average two points lower.           
These data have an interesting bearing upon the question of 
promotion and retardation. The pupil who wrote paper B, the 
poorer of the two, received from his teacher a mark 5 points above 
the passing grade, whereas twenty-two out of the one hundred and 
forty-two teachers did not give a passing grade to this pupil. The
-P-A-G-E-14
6 EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENTS 
promotion or retardation of a pupil depends to a considerable extent 
upon the subjective estimate of his teacher. : 
The probable error of the grades is approximately 4.5. This 
means that the individual marks deviate on the average 4.5 points 
from the median or average of the entire group of marks. The fact 
of such a large probable error shows the absurdity of marking to the 
fractional part of one point, as was done in quite a number of papers. 
One paper was even graded as fine as 79.9. The probability is that 
at best any one teacher’s mark is 5 points from the true mark, if 
the average mark given by a large number of teachers may be re- 
garded as a true mark. A truer way of indicating the mark of a 
paper would be 80 plus or minus 5, to show that the chances are 
even that the mark is within 5 points of being correct.

Fic. 3. — Passing grade 75. Marks assigned by schools whose passing grade was 70 were 
weighted by 3 points. Median 70. Probable error 7.5. 
The Reliability of Marks in the Case of Mathematics. It has 
been urged that marks in language work must necessarily vary con- 
siderably because of the personal and subjective factors involved, 
and that the situation is very different in an exact science such as 
mathematics.. An investigation, similar to the one with the English 
paper, was made with a geometry paper which had been written as 
a final examination by a pupil in a high school. 
This paper was graded by 118 teachers of mathematics yielding a 
distribution of marks as exhibited in Fig. 3. There is a current 
assumption that a mathematical paper can be graded with mathe- 
matical precision. This investigation shows that the marks of this 
particular geometry paper varied even more widely than the, marks 
of the English papers. The probable error of the geometry marks
-P-A-G-E-15
MARKS AS MEASURES OF SCHOOL WORK 7 
was 7.5, whereas the probable error of the English marks was 4.0 and 
4.8 respectively. 
A little analysis, however, will show the absurdity of assuming 
greater precision in evaluating a mathematical paper than in evaluat- 
ing a language or any other kind of paper. While it is true that 
there can be no difference of opinion as to the correctness of a dem- 
onstration or of the solution of a problem, yet there are various ways 
in which a demonstration may be worked out, involving the succes- 
sion of the steps, the use of theorems and definitions, the neatness of 
the drawings and, most of all, the relative value of each particular 
demonstration, definition, step or error in the evaluation of the 
paper asa whole. Obviously the complication of factors is as intri- 
cate in one sort of paper as in another. 
It is therefore evident that there is no inherent reason why a 
mathematical paper should be capable of more precise evaluation 
than any other kind of paper. In fact, the greater certainty of 
correctness or incorrectness of a mathematical demonstration or 
definition may even contribute slightly to the wider variability of 
the marks, because the strict marker would have less occasion to 
give the pupil the benefit of the doubt. 
Further tabulation of the results also demonstrated that the 
marks given to the answer for a single question of the paper varied 
as widely as those given to the paper as a whole. 
  Fic. 4. — Marks assigned to a history paper by seventy teachers. 
Reliability of Marks in the Case of History. An investigation 
conducted in exactly the same manner as the two preceding ones 
was made with a final examination paper in United States History. 
The marks assigned by seventy teachers of history are shown in 
Fig. 4. The distribution of these marks is very similar to that 
found for the English and mathematics papers. The extreme range 
extends from 43 to 92, with a probable error of 7.7. 
The chief results of these investigations are that the marks as-
-P-A-G-E-16
8 EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENTS 
signed to the same paper by different teachers vary enormously and 
that the variability or unreliability of marks is as great in one sub- 
ject as in another. Contrary to current belief, grades in mathe- 
atics are as unre i i age his 
The immense variability of marks tends obviously to cast consid- 
erable discredit upon the fairness and accuracy of our present 
methods of evaluating the quality of work in school. No matter 
how much any one may wish to minimize the utility of marks, they 
have, nevertheless, an indispensable administrative value from the 
standpoint of the school, and a real personal value from the stand- 
| point of the pupil. 
i Factors Producing the Variability of Marks. How are such wide 
ranges of differences to be explained? Four major factors enter 
into the situation: (1) Differences among the standards of different 
schools, (2) Differences among the standards of different teachers, 
(3) Differences in the relative values placed by different teachers               
     
     
      upon various elements in a paper, and (4) Differences due to the 
inability to distinguish between closely allied degrees of merit. 
How much of the variation is due to each factor? To determine 
the strength of the first factor a further study was made in which 
ten papers written in the final examination in freshman English at 
the University of Wisconsin were graded independently by ten in- 
structors of the various sections of freshman English. An effort is 
made by codperation among the instructors concerned to have as 
much uniformity as possible in the conduct of these sections. The 
same final examination is given to all. The grades thus assigned 
varied just as widely as those assigned by teachers in different in- 
stitutions. 
Another point of interest is the fact that the teachers under whom 
the students took the course did not succeed in grading the papers 
any more accurately than the other instructors who did not know 
the students. The mean variation of their grades was as large as 
that of the marks assigned by the other teachers. 
There was also a very noticeable difference in the standard of 
grading. One instructor graded the papers on the whole thirteen 
points lower than the average and another instructor graded them 
seven points higher than the average. 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
  MARKS AS MEASURES OF SCHOOL WORK 9 
After eliminating the variation in the marks due to this difference 
in standards among the instructors, by raising or lowering each one’s 
marks according to the amount that each instructor’s average differed 
from the general average, it was found that the variability was 
smaller, though not as much smaller as one might anticipate. The 
mean variation was reduced only 1 point, from 5.3 to 4.3. 
The next step was to separate the third and fourth factors. That 
is, how much of the variation is due to the inability to distinguish 
between closely allied degrees of merit and how much is due to 
differences in relative values placed by different instructors upon 
various aspects of a given paper, such as form, neatness, clearness, 
etc. 
The accuracy of distinctions between various shades of merit was 
ascertained by having the same persons give two evaluations to the 
same papers separated by sufficiently long intervals of time so that 
the details and identity of the papers had been forgotten. 
By having seven instructors regrade each a set of his own papers, 
it was found that the mean variation was reduced to 2.2 points. In 
several instances the second mark differed as much as ten or fifteen 
points from the first mark. 
The mathematics instructors did not agree any more closely with 
their own marks than the language or science instructors. We may 
eliminate one further factor, namely, the difference due to a change 
in an instructor’s standard after an interval of time. This was 
done by weighting the second set of marks by the difference between 
the averages of the two markings. This reduced the mean variation 
to 1.75 points. 
—UF the four factors stated at the outset, each contributes the tot-—— 
lowing amount to the total variation: The general mean variation or 
probable error of grades assigned by teachers in different schools was 
5.4 points. The mean variation of grades assigned by teachers in the 
same department and institution was 5.3. The mean variation of 
the latter, after eliminating the effect of high or low personal stand- 
ards was 4.3. The mean variation of grades assigned at different 
times by the same teachers to their own papers was 2.2. Hence the 
largest factors were the second, third and fourth. The fourth con- 
tributed 2.2 points, the third 2.1 points, the second 1.0 point and the 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
    Io EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENTS 
first practically nothing toward the total of 5.4 points of mean 
variation. 
The Fineness of the Marking Scale 
How small divisons on a marking scale are practically usable? 
As a matter of psychological methodology, the units of any scale of 
measurements, if a single measurement with the scale is to have 
objective validity, should be of such a size that three fourths of all 
the measurements of the same quantity shall fall within the limits 
of one division of the scale. For example, if the marks assigned by 
75 out of 100 teachers to a given paper lie between 80 and go, then 
the unit of our scale should be ten points. Any smaller division 
would have little or no objective significance. Of course, almost 
indefinitely small differences in merit can be measured if an indefinite 
number of independent estimates is made. fe 
Now what are the actual facts with regard to the size of distin- 
guishable steps in the marking scale? We have seen above that the 
mean variation of the estimates of a teacher in matching his own 
marks, after eliminating his own change in standard, is 1.75 points. 
According to the principle that if a unit is to be large enough in 
range to include three fourths of all his estimates of the same quan- 
tity, then the smallest distinguishable step that can be used with 
reasonable validity is 23 times the mean variation (1.75) or probable 
error, which would be 4.8, or roughly 5 points.! ‘ : 
Hence our marking scale, instead of being 100, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 
etc., should be 100, 95, 90, 85, 80, etc. These are the smallest divi- 
sions that can be used with reasonable confidence by a teacher in 
grading his own pupils. This means that on a scale of passing 
grades of 70 to 100 only seven division points are distinguishable. 
This substantially confirms the scheme followed in many institu- 
tions that the marking scale should be A+,A —-,B+,B-—,C+, 
C-—,D+,D — and failure. Letters or symbols are perhaps pref- 
erable to such designations as Excellent, Good, Fair and Poor be- 
cause of the moral implication in the latter. 
1To those who may be interested in the basis of this computation I may say that a range 
twice the size of the probable error includes one half of the series of estimates, and a range 2.8 
times the mean variation or 3.4 times the probable error includes approximately three fourths 
of the series of estimates. In practice the mean variation and the probable error are used inter- 
changeably, but the former is usually a trifle larger than the latter.
-P-A-G-E-19
  MARKS AS MEASURES OF SCHOOL WORK II 
Even as fine a scale as this might perhaps better be replaced by a 
coarser one computed on the mean variation of 4.3 points, which is 
the mean variation of different teachers in the same department and 
institution after the effect of the personal standard has been elimi- 
nated. On this basis the range of a division on the scale should be 
4.3 times 2}, or approximately 12 points. The reason for this larger 
step would be that this is as closely as 75 out of 100 competent 
teachers agree on the evaluation of the same papers. One teacher 
may be as much in the right for grading a paper 80 as another for 
grading it 90. The only ultimate criterion is the consensus or aver- 
age of estimates. This coarser scale would allow for only three divi- 
sions of passing grades, A, B and C. But the finer scale proposed 
above can be used with reasonable accuracy by a teacher in grading 
his own pupils in the light of his own viewpoint. 
Of course, any one may use as fine a scale as one pleases provided 
one recognizes the range of the probable error of the scale used. 
The fine scale, if conscientiously used, probably tends to stimulate 
the making of finer distinctions than a coarse scale does. However, 
the chief objections to a very fine scale are: (1) An illusion of accu- 
racy, (2) injustice to the student of supposed differences where no 
differences actually exist or where the relative merit may be just 
reversed, (3) embarrassment to the teacher due to this injustice. 
If we admit the soundness of our reasoning, it may seem to many 
teachers that a scale of five steps is rather crude and that the evalua- 
tion of a pupil’s attainment is very coarse. As a matter of fact, the 
steps of the proposed scale are reasonably fine. 
Apropos of this point a comparison was made with measurements 
of a similar type in an entirely different field by having a group of 
carpenters estimate by visual impression the lengths of rods. A 
mechanic through constant use has acquired a fairly definite mental 
image of an inch or a foot. Yet a mechanic’s estimate of the length 
of a rod is not an iota more accurate than a teacher’s estimate of an 
examination paper. 
If we are attempting to evaluate a paper by a scale of 100, 99, 98, 
97, 96, 95, etc., we are attempting to make finer distinctions than 
we are capable of. The mind does not discriminate with any degree 
of certainty by a single judgment between a paper of grade 85 and
-P-A-G-E-20
  12 EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENTS 
another one of grade 86. If the second is appreciably better it 
more likely ought to have a grade of 90. Such small distinctions 
would have validity only if a set of papers were graded by ten teachers 
or by the same teacher ten times. , The situation is analogous to 
estimating the width of a room in inches when it should be estimated 
in feet. Estimates in terms of large units, of course, do not have 
greater absolute accuracy, but they will have greater uniformity. 
The Distribution of Marks 
The viewpoint which will be maintained here is that marks on the 
whole and for large groups of pupils of usual ability should be dis- 
tributed with a reasonably close conformity to the normal, bell- 
shaped, probability curve. The chief reasons for this principle are 
that physical traits, such as height, length of arms, girth of head, 
are distributed in accordance with the probability curve; that mental 
functions of which accurate measurements have been made are also 
distributed in this fashion; and that marks assigned by many 
teachers to the same pupils approximate closely to this distribution. 
There are, however, three factors which tend to disturb this distri- 
bution of ability: elimination of the poorer pupils as they pass from 
grade to grade, the raising of the performance of pupils by good 
teaching and the lowering of their performance because of a lack of 
maximum effort. The third factor counteracts the first and the 
second. Lack of maximum effort tends to push the marks down. 
Elimination of the poorer pupils tends to push them up. The most 
important factor is elimination. But so far as we have any definite 
facts about this matter, the effect of elimination in disturbing con- 
formity to the curve is much less than is commonly supposed. The 
effect of elimination is not so much a disturbance of the shape of the 
curve as a contraction of the range of the distribution. The elimi- 
nation of pupils is not a cutting off at a definite point of the curve, 
but rather a smooth shaving off along the entire range. It is cer- 
tain that, on the whole, marks will be assigned much more justly if 
they are assigned with reasonably close conformity to the probability 
distribution, than if no heed is given to it and every teacher allowed 
to follow his own inclination. Large deviations should occur only 
when genuine reasons exist.
-P-A-G-E-21
  MARKS AS MEASURES OF SCHOOL WORK 13 
The form of the probability curve is indicated in Fig. 5 which 
also shows the distribution of approximately 5000 grades assigned 
to freshmen in the University of Wisconsin. The conformity of these 
grades to the normal curve is very close. 
The adoption of a uniform scale of grades as well as a uniform 
standard in the frequency with which the different grades should be 
assigned, is a pressing need. These ends could be attained by adopt- 
ing a scale of five steps, with finer subgradations, if desired, and by 
having each teacher and each institution compare the frequency of 
the various grades assigned with the theoretical frequency. Then 
an A+ or a B— would have more nearly the same significance 
under different teachers and in different institutions than they have 
at the present time. 
The practical situation 
which needs to be at- 
tacked is the possibility 
of bringing about greater 
uniformity both among 
schools and among teach- 
ers within the same 
school. Several Z things 65 63 69-72 78-76 77-80 81-84 85-88 89-92 98-96 97-100

a study of the marks as actually assigned by the different teachers ina 
school, to tabulate them and to discuss them in a meeting of the teach- - 
ing staff. This, in itself, isa wholesome thing to do. It will correct 
many of the gross differences without special advice or request. 
Second, in departments composed of several teachers, it would be 
well to determine by consensus of opinion upon some common plan 
of marking certain types of work and certain types of errors. Third, 
the marks could be distributed, with certain allowances for personal 
judgment and common-sense variation, either according to the 
normal probability distribution or according to some distribution 
agreed upon by the teaching staff of the school. 
A recent experiment shows that this third suggestion will actually 
be efficacious in producing greater agreement in the marks given to

the same pieces of work by different judges. A set of twenty-four 
compositions on the subject of “Roads,” written by sixth-and seventh- 
grade pupils, was marked by twenty-three teachers according to the 
usual percentage scale with 70 as the passing mark. Each teacher 
was then instructed to shift or change his marks into terms of a five- 
step scale, Poor, Inferior, Medium, Superior and Excellent, so that 
two out of the twenty-four papers would be marked Poor, four to 
six Inferior, eight to ten Medium, four to six Superior and two Excel- 
lent. They were asked to force their marks to conform to this dis- 
tribution so that even if they felt, for example, that no paper was 
good enough to be rated Excellent they should pick out the most 
likely candidates. 
The variability of the second set of marks, distributed by compul- 
sion according to the probability distribution, was greatly reduced. 
The mean variation of the original marks was 4.2 and that of the 
adjusted marks, reduced to numerical terms, was 2.8. The vari- 
ability of the original marks was unusually low, possibly because 
this experiment was carried out after an extensive discussion of the 
conditions of variability and of the theoretical distribution of marks. 
The readjustment of the marks has therefore reduced the vari- 
ability to nearly one half as compared with a mean variation of 5.3 
and to about two thirds as compared with the mean variation of 4.2. 
It might be questioned whether it was justifiable to force a re- 
arrangement of the marks according to the suggested distribution. 
Several teachers protested against grading any paper in this group 
as excellent because they did not consider any one to be of sufficient 
merit. This, however, is an indication of the lack of a standard. 
One teacher marked one of the papers 85 and objected to giving it a 
grade of excellent, but he was obliged to do so, as this was in his 
judgment the best paper. The average grade of this paper was 92.9, 
showing that the mark of this teacher was low on account of a lack 
of common standard. The proposed distribution suggested to the 
teachers, which was followed in the readjustment of the marks, was 
entirely justifiable. This fact is shown by the averages of the original 
marks. These averages yield a normal distribution: Thus there 
were two papers out of the twenty-four whose average grades were 
below 72, six whose average grades were between 73 and 77, ten
-P-A-G-E-23
MARKS AS MEASURES OF SCHOOL WORK I5 
between 78 and 83, four between 84 and 89 and two above go. 
Even as small a class as twenty-four pupils, unless specially selected, 
will conform to the probability distribution to a remarkable extent. 
Certain deviations from a strict conformity should, of course, be 
permissible where there is a genuine reason for it. 
On the basis of all these experimental results it would seem that 
the most satisfactory marking system would be a scale of five steps: 
A or Excellent, which should be assigned to approximately 7% of the pupils. 
B or Superior, which should be assigned to approximately 24% of the pupils. 
C or Average, which should be assigned to approximately 38% of the pupils. 
D or Inferior, which should be assigned to approximately 24% of the pupils. 
E or Unsatisfactory, which should be assigned to approximately 7% of the pupils. 
If finer distinctions are desired, the plus or minus signs may be 
added.

CHAPTER III 
A SAMPLE SURVEY OF THE MARKING SYSTEM IN A HIGH 
SCHOOL 
In order that the principles and findings discussed in the preced- 
ing chapter may actually become operative in the assignment of 
grades, a sample survey will be presented here as an illustration of 
how the marking system employed in a given school may be ex- 
amined. The concrete situation is this: Here is a particular marking 
system in a school. Do the teachers apply it uniformly and fairly, 
and is the system as a whole justifiable? 
In order to make a thorough examination of a marking system it 
is necessary to consider the three fundamental problems raised in 
the preceding chapter with reference to the system to be studied. 
1. What is the nature of the scale employed? 
2. How accurately are the marks assigned ? 
3. How are the marks, as assigned by each teacher, distributed ? 
The marking system to be examined is that of a high school of 
medium size. The first and second problems as to the nature and 
accuracy of the scale will be considered together. In this school the 
usual percentile system is used. The passing grade is 60 and a 
grade of 90 or above grants exemption from examinations. Accord- 
ing to the findings of the preceding chapter, the scale is too finely 
graded. <A coarser scale would be better, although this matter is 
not serious so long as the variability of the marks in terms of this 
scale is recognized. 
The third point as to the distribution of the marks should answer 
such questions as these: How uniformly do the teachers assign the 
marks? How much difference is there in the standards of liberality 
or severity of marking among the teachers of the school? Does the 
rule of exemption from examinations affect the fairness of marking? 
These questions can best be answered by preparing a distribution

curve of the marks of each teacher and of the school as a whole as 
shown in Figs. 6 and 7. ‘ 
The chief points of criticism are: 
(1) The marks for the school as a whole are too high. The teachers 
are too liberal. In the distribution curve for the entire school, 
Fig. 7, 49% of the pupils received 90 or above. This curve has 
no resemblance or approach to the normal distribution curve dis- 
cussed in the preceding chapter. On the basis of a five-step scale, 
A in this school would be equal to 90-99, B 80-89, C 70-79, D 60-69

and E 59 or lower. According to the normal distribution, approx- 
imately 7% of the pupils should receive A. In this school, 49% 
received 90-99. Approximately 24% should receive B. In this 
school, 30% received 80-89. Approximately 38% should receive C. 
In this school, 12% received 70-79. Approximately 24% should 
receive D. In this school, 2% received 60-69. Approximately 7% 
should receive E. In this school, 7% received 59 or lower. 
Whatever any one may hold as to the principle of distributing marks 
in conformity to the probability curve, it is very certain that all possible 
factors, which tend to destroy absolute conformity, disturb this con-

formity only to a small extent when compared with the utter absence 
of conformity in the marks as assigned by many teachers. It is 
only a reasonably close conformity with permissible deviations for 
genuine reasons, that is here argued for. There is no justification 
for the marks of the English teacher or the German teacher as con- 
trasted with those of the mathematics teacher or even the history 
teacher. 
(2) The rule of exempting pupils from examinations who receive 
a grade of 90 or above has had a pernicious effect upon nearly all 
teachers in raising the grades of many pupils to 90 who should not 
have had as high a grade. This is obviously shown by the fact that 
nearly every curve has a sudden rise at go. 
(3) The worst offenders in grading too liberally are the teacher in 
manual training, in domestic science and in English, none of whom 
failed any pupils or gave a grade lower than 78, although the passable 
grades extend down to 60. 
(4) The worst offenders in giving too many grades of 90 or above 
are the teacher in English, the teacher in German and the teacher 
in commercial subjects. The English teacher gave to 80% of the 
pupils 90 or above, the German teacher gave to 70% of the pupils 
go or above and the commercial teacher gave to 63% of the pupils 
go or above. 
(5) The mathematics teacher marked too severely as indicated by 
the many failures and by the numerous marks between 75 and 80. 
(6) The passing grade of 60 is too low, not for any intrinsic reason, 
but because it makes the range of passable marks too wide. Only 
three teachers used the grades between 60 and 70. 
Recommendations for the improvement of the marking system in 
this high school : 
(1) The substitution of a five-step scale for the present numerical 
scale, or if the numerical scale is retained, the placing of the passing 
mark at 70 instead of 60. 
(2) The abolition of the rule of exemption from examinations at 
go or above. : 
(3) Closer conformity in the distribution of the marks to the normal 
distribution.

CHAPTER IV 
THE MEASUREMENT OF ABILITY IN READING 
Essential Elements in Reading. Adequate measurements of any 
complex mental functions, such as those involved in school studies, 
require, first of all, an analysis of the functions into their essential 
constituents, and, second, the preparation of accurate tests for each 
of these elements. From the practical point of view, we learn to 
read in order to obtain information. Obviously, then, the chief 
elements in reading are (1) the comprehension of the material read, 
(2) the speed of reading, and (3) the correctness of the pronuncia- 
tion, or élocution. The first two are the most important so far as 
reading strictly is concerned, since we learn to read for our own 
individual uses. For this reason, such factors as intonation, expres- 
sion, pauses and the like are relatively insignificant. We use silent 
rather than oral reading in practical life. 
Methods of Testing. The speed of reading may be measured by 
determining the amount of a certain kind of text that can be read 
in a given period of time, for example, the number of words read per 
second. Comprehension perhaps cannot be determined quite so 
easily. In the tests to be described presently the method adopted 
consists in reproducing the thought in writing immediately after 
the reading. The validity of measuring comprehension in this 
manner will be discussed later. 
The test material for measuring ability in reading is composed 
of nine passages. See the following pages.! These passages were 
so selected that the increases in difficulty from one sample to the 
next represent fairly uniform steps. 
Instructions for Administering the Tests. Explain to the pupils 
that they are to read silently as rapidly as they can and at the same 
1 These test blanks are printed on separate sheets and may be obtained in desired 
quantities from the author.

  THE MEASUREMENT OF ABILITY IN READING 2r 
time to grasp as much as they can, and that they will be asked to 
write down, not necessarily in the same words, as much as they will 
remember of what they read. 
They should also be told not to read anything over again, but to 
read on continuously as rapidly as is consistent with grasping what 
they read. 
Use for a given grade the test blank that bears the same number 
as your grade. For example, use number 4 with the fourth grade, 
number 5 with the fifth grade, etc. On the next day repeat the test 
in the same manner, but use the blank of the next grade below yours, 
that is, in the fourth grade use number 3, in the fifth grade use num- 
ber 4, etc: (For high school and college students, blanks number 8 
and 9, or 7 and 9, may be used.) 
The blanks for the test should be distributed to the pupils with 
the backs of the blanks up, so that no one will be able to read any 
of the material until all are ready. Then give the signal “ turn” 
and “start.” Allow them to read exactly thirty seconds. Then 
have the pupils make a mark with a pencil after the last word read 
to indicate how far they have read. : 
Then have them turn the blanks over immediately and write on 
the back all that they remember having read. Allow as much time 
as they need, but make sure that they do not copy from each other, 
or turn the blank over to see the text. Finally have them fill out the 
spaces at the bottom of the blank. 
N.B. Make sure of allowing exactly 30 seconds for reading. See 
that they all start and stop at the same time. 
It is recommended that the vocabulary test on page 37 be given in 
conjunction with the test for speed and comprehension. These three 
tests together will serve as a very adequate measure of a pupil’s read- 
ing ability.

Little Abe hurried home as fast as his feet could carry 
him. Perhaps if he had worn stockings and shoes like 
yours, he could have run faster. But, instead, he wore 
deerskin leggings and clumsy moccasins of bearskin that 
his mother had made for him. 
Such a funny little figure as he was, hurrying along 
across the rough fields! His suit was made of war home- 
spun cloth. His cap was made of coonskin, and the tail 
of the coon hung behind him, like a furry tassel. 
But if you could have looked into the honest, twinkling

liked him at once. 
In one hand little Abe held something very precious. 
It was only a book, but little Abe thought more of that 
book than he would have thought of gold or precious

You cannot know just what that book meant to little

The red squirrel usually waked me in the dawn, run-

house, as if sent out of the woods for this very purpose. 
In the course of the winter I threw out half a bushel 
of ears of sweet corn onto the snow crust by my door, 
and was amused by watching the motions of the various 
animals which were baited by it. All day long the 
red squirrels came and went, and afforded me much 
entertainment by their maneuvers. 
One would approach, at first, warily through the 
shrub oaks, running over the snow crust by fits and

go a few paces this way, with wonderful speed, making 
haste with his “trotters” as if it were for a wager; and 
now as many paces that way, but never getting on 
more than half a rod at a time. 
Then suddenly he would pause with a ludicrous ex-

Once upon a time, there lived a very rich man, and a king besides, 
whose name was Midas; and he had a little daughter, whom nobody 
but myself ever heard of, and whose name I either never knew, or - 
have entirely forgotten. So, because I love odd names for little 
girls, I choose to call her Marygold. 
This King Midas was fonder of gold than anything else in the 
world. He valued his royal crown chiefly because it was composed 
of that precious metal. If he loved anything better, or half so well, 
it was the one little maiden who played so merrily around her father’s 
footstool. But the more Midas loved his daughter, the more did he 
desire and seek for wealth. He thought, foolish man! that the best 
thing he could possibly do for his dear child would be to give her the 
immensest pile of yellow, glistening coin, that had ever been heaped 
together since the world was made. Thus, he gave all his thoughts 
and all his time to this one purpose. If ever he happened to gaze 
for an instant at the gold-tinted clouds of sunset, he wished that they 
were real gold, and that they could be squeezed safely into his strong 
box. When little Marygold ran to meet him, with a bunch of but- 
tercups and dandelions, he used to say, “Poh, poh, child! If these 
flowers were as golden as they look, they would be worth the 
plucking !”’ 
And yet, in his earlier days, before he was so entirely possessed of 
this insane desire for riches, King Midas had shown a great taste 
for flowers.

In a secluded and mountainous part of Stiria there was in old 
time a valley of the most surprising and luxuriant fertility. It 
was surrounded on all sides by steep and rocky mountains, ris- 
ing into peaks, which were always covered with snow, and from 
which a number of torrents descended in constant cataracts. One 
of these fell westward over the face of a crag so high that, when 
the sun had set to everything else, and all below was darkness, 
his beams still shone full upon this waterfall, so that it looked like 
a shower of gold. It was, therefore, called by the people of the 
neighborhood, the Golden River. It was strange that none of these 
streams fell into the valley itself. They all descended on the other 
side of the mountains, and wound away through broad plains and 
past populous cities. But the clouds were drawn so constantly 
to the snowy hills, and rested so softly in the circular hollow, that 
in time of drought and heat, when all the country round was burnt 
up, there was still rain in the little valley; and its crops were so 
heavy and its hay so high, and its apples so red, and its grapes so 
blue, and its wine so rich, and its honey so sweet, that it was a mar- 
vel to every one who beheld it, and was commonly called the Treas- 
ure Valley. 
The whole of this little valley belonged to three brothers called 
Schwartz, Hans and Gluck. Schwartz and Hans, the two elder 
brothers, were very ugly men, with overhanging eyebrows and small 
dull eyes.

Captain John Hull was the mint-master of Massachusetts, and 
coined all the money that was made there. This was a new line 
of business, for in the earlier days of the colony the current coinage 
consisted of gold and silver money of England, Portugal, and Spain. 
These coins being scarce, the people were often forced to barter 
their commodities instead of selling them. 
For instance, if a man wanted to buy a coat, he perhaps exchanged 
a bearskin for it. If he wished for a barrel of molasses, he might 
purchase it with a pile of pine boards. Musket-bullets were used 
instead of farthings. The Indians had a sort of money called 
wampum, which was made of clam-shells, and this strange sort 
of specie was likewise taken in payment of debts by the English 
settlers. Bank-bills had never been heard of. There was not 
money enough of any kind, in many parts of the country, to pay 
the salaries of the ministers, so that they sometimes had to take 
quintals of fish, bushels of corn, or cords of wood instead of silver 
and gold. 
As the people grew more numerous and their trade one with 
another increased, the want of current money was still more sen- 
sibly felt. To supply the demand the general court passed a law 
for establishing a coinage of shillings, sixpences, and threepences. 
Captain John Hull was appointed to manufacture this money, and 
was to have about one shilling out of every twenty to pay him for 
the trouble of making them.

The years went on, and Ernest ceased to be a boy. He had 
grown to be a young man now. He attracted little notice from 
the other inhabitants of the valley; for they saw nothing remark- 
able in his way of life, save that, when the labor of the day was 
over he still loved to go apart and gaze and meditate upon the 
Great Stone Face. According to their idea of the matter, it was 
a folly, indeed, but pardonable, inasmuch as Ernest was indus- 
trious, kind, and neighborly, and neglected no duty for the sake of 
indulging this idle habit. They knew not that the Great Stone 
Face had become a teacher to him, and that the sentiment which 
was expressed in it would enlarge the young man’s heart, and fill 
it with wider and deeper sympathies than other hearts. They knew 
not that thence would come a better wisdom than could be learned 
from books, and a better life than could be molded on the defaced 
example of other human lives. Neither did Ernest know that the 
thoughts and affections which came to him so naturally, in the 
fields and at the fireside, and wherever he communed with himself, 
were of a higher tone than those which all men shared with him. 
By this time poor Mr. Gathergold was dead and buried; and 
the oddest part of the matter was, that his wealth, which was the 
body and spirit of his existence, had disappeared before his death, 
leaving nothing of him but a living skeleton, covered over with a 
wrinkled, yellow skin. Since the melting away of his gold, it had 
been very generally conceded that there was no such striking resem- 
blance, after all, betwixt the ignoble features of the ruined merchant 
and that majestic face upon the mountainside.

To an American visiting Europe, the long voyage he has to make 
is an excellent preparative. The temporary absence of worldly 
scenes and employments produces a state of mind peculiarly fitted 
to receive new and vivid impressions. The vast space of waters 
that separates the hemispheres is like a blank page in existence. 
There is no gradual transition, by which, as in Europe, the features 
and population of one country blend almost imperceptibly with 
those of another. From the moment you lose sight of the land 
you have left, all is vacancy until you step on the opposite shore, 
and are launched at once into the bustle and novelties of another 
world. 
In traveling by land there is a continuity of scene and a con- 
nected succession of persons and incidents, that carry on the story 
of life, and lessen the effect of absence and separation. We drag, 
it is true, ‘“‘a lengthening chain,” at each remove of our pilgrimage ; 
but the chain is unbroken: we can trace it back link by link; and 
we feel that the last still grapples us to home. But a wide sea voy- 
age severs us at once. It makes us conscious of being cast loose 
from the secure anchorage of settled life, and sent adrift upon a 
doubtful world. It interposes a gulf, not merely imaginary, but 
real, between us and our homes —a gulf subject to tempest, and 
fear, and uncertainty, rendering distance palpable, and return 
precarious. : 
Such, at least, was the case with myself. As I saw the last blue 
line of my native land fade away like a cloud in the horizon, it seemed 
as if I had closed one volume of the world and its concerns, and 
had time for meditation, before I opened another.

Instructions for Scoring the Tests. The speed of reading is 
determined by ascertaining the number of words read per second. 
This can be done very rapidly by having a blank on which is indi- 
cated the: number of each word. By this blank the total number 
of words read can be determined instantaneously. Dividing by 
thirty will give the speed of reading per second.” The average num- 
ber of words read per second for the two passages is taken as the score 
for speed. 
Comprehension is determined by counting the number of words 
written which correctly reproduce the thought. The written account 
is carefully read, and all words which either reproduce the ideas of 
the test passage or repeat ideas previously recorded are crossed 
out. The remaining words are counted and used as the index of 
comprehension. The average of the two tests is taken as the final 
score. On an average about 7 per cent of the words written need 
to be disCarded. In many papers nothing needs to be discarded. 
Various objeCtions may be urged against this method of scoring, but 
these are believed not to be serious. They will be considered later. 
A sample test follows to illustrate the method of scoring. It is 
the record of an eighth-grade girl with test No. 8. This pupil had 
read 142 words, or 3.7 words per second. She wrote 77 words, five 
of which ‘were discarded. These are inclosed in parenthesis in the 
following: } i 
The years went on and. Ernest grew to be a man. He was not so very well 
known in the valley as he was quite (with, know, habits, besides, always) at night 
when his work was done, he went aside and watched the great stone face. As 
he was industrious and kind and only indulged in this idle amusement the neigh- 
bors thought it all right. They did not know that the great Stone Face became 
a teacher to him. 
A considerable amount of time in scoring comprehension may be 
saved in cases where only the average for a class is desired by simply 
counting the number of words written by each pupil without discard- 
ing anything, by obtaining next the average of these scores, and by 
reducing then this average by 7%. This plan will give just as reliable 
an average as the longer method of scoring. When, however, the score 
for individual pupils is desired, the longer method must be followed. 
Standards of Attainment in Reading. In every branch of in- 
struction in the public schools we need a definite standard of attain-

ment to be reached at the end of each grade. If we had such stand- 
ards and if we had adequate means of precisely measuring ability, it 
would be possible for a qualified person to go into a schoolroom and 
measure the attainment in any or all subjects and determine on the 
basis of these measurements whether the pupils are up to the stand- 
ard, whether they are deficient, how much, and in what specific 
respects. 
The following are standard scores of attainment for the ends of 
the respective years, based on over 6000 pupils in 27 schools. These 
scores are represented in the graphs in Fig. 8. The tests have been 
made, however, with approximately 75,000 pupils. s

THE MEASUREMENT OF ABILITY IN READING 
In many instances 
it is desirable to ex- 
press a pupil’s read- 
ing ability by one 
score which shall 
. combine both speed 
and comprehension. 
For example, one 
pupil has a score of 
3.0 words per sec- 
ond for speed and 25 
for comprehension. 
Another pupil has a 
score of 3.0 for speed 
and 44 for compre- 
hension. It is desir- 
able to express each 
pupil’s ability by a 
single figure which 
may be compared 
directly with a sin- 
gle figure of any 
other pupil. 
If we may as- 
sume, as we shall do 
here, that a growth 
in speed from the 
first grade to the 
eighth is equal to 
the parallel growth 
in comprehension 
from the first to the 
eighth, then the 
growth in speed of 
2.5, from 1.5 in the 
first grade to 4.0 in 
the eighth, is equal

to a growth in comprehension of 35, from rs in the first grade to 50 
in the eighth grade. Hence a growth of .1 of a word in speed is 
equal to a growth of 1.4 words in comprehension. On this basis we 
may equate the score for speed and comprehension simply and 
quickly according to the principle of a slide rule as represented in 
Fig. 9. The scale for speed is given on the left side and the corre- . 
sponding units of the scale for comprehension on the right side. The 
single score combining speed and comprehension for a given pupil 
can be read off instantaneously and may be expressed in terms 
either of speed or of comprehension. For example, the first pupil 
mentioned in the preceding paragraph, with a score of 3.0 for speed 
and 25 for comprehension, would have a single score of 2.6 in terms 
of speed or 31 in terms of comprehension. ‘This is done by finding 3.0 
on the scale for speed and 25 on the scale for comprehension. The

equivalent value for 25 in terms of speed is 2.2, the number opposite 
25 on the speed scale. The average of 3.0 and 2.2 is 2.6. Or, if it is 
desirable to express this single score in terms of comprehension, then 
the score is 31, which is the value opposite 2.6. The single score of 
the second pupil with a score of 3.0 in speed and 44 in comprehension 
would be 3.3 in terms of speed, or 42 in terms of comprehension. In 
order to have uniformity it will be desirable to express this single score 
in terms of speed rather than in terms of comprehension. The second 
pupil would be better than the first by .7; that is, he would be as much 
better than the first as a difference in speed of reading .7 of a word 
more per second would indicate, comprehension being the same in both. 
By means of the standard curves it is possible to compare accu-

entire grade, of an entire school or of a whole school system. Figure 
1o shows the comparison with the standards of an elementary school 
of 401 pupils in a city of 40,000 population. Figure 11 gives the 
results of a test in a small city of about 2000 population. There is 
considerable deficiency in nearly all grades in the latter city, which 
is probably due to the large foreign element. This is indicated by 
the fact that some of the pupils wrote their tests in a foreign language. 
Critical Points concerning the Reliability of the Tests. First, 
the time limit. Does reading for thirty seconds adequately test 
a person’s reading capacity? The time limit of thirty seconds was 
chosen, first, because the necessary material for this interval could 
all be printed on a sheet of paper about the size of an ordinary page 
in a reader, and, second, because a longer interval of time would 
increase very materially the labor of scoring the results. But irre- 
spective of length of text or labor of scoring, the chief. point is the 
reliability of the tests. 
In order to determine whether thirty seconds is an adequate length 
of time, a test was made on a group of persons with two longer pas- 
sages, one requiting approximately two and one half minutes to read 
and the other approximately five minutes. Speed and comprehension 
-were determined in the same manner as in the regular tests. 
These results showed that a person’s performance in one passage 
is practically the same as in any other and that the interval of thirty 
seconds is sufficiently long to give a very adequate test of a person’s 
reading capacity both in regard to speed and comprehension. 
A second critical point is the increasing difficulty of the test pas- 
sages. These nine selections were chosen.after some experimenta- 
tion so that the successive passage would increase in difficulty by 
approximately uniform steps. Perfect uniformity in the steps is 
not absolutely necessary, since the growth in reading capacity from 
grade to grade can be measured by the method described; namely, 
of testing each grade with its own sample and also with the sample 
of the grade just below it, and if desired, also with the sample of the 
grade just above it. 
Objection to some of the passages might be taken on the ground 
that they are more or less familiar fables or pieces of literature. But 
a comparison of the results with the different passages gave no indi-
-P-A-G-E-45
THE MEASUREMENT OF ABILITY IN READING 37 
cation that selection No. 5 about King Midas was read more rapidly 
or retained more fully than its position demanded. There is every 
indication on the basis of the tests made thus far that the familiarity 
gained in the ordinary reading in school with any passage will not 
appreciably affect the tests unless the reading has been done very 
recently, say, within a month preceding the test. This point can 
always be checked up by the fact that the tests on the same pupils 
are made with two different passages. 
A third point which must be considered is the written reproduc- 
tion of the thought as an index of comprehension. Some pupils 
may be able to express themselves more readily in writing and others 
more readily in speaking. Ideally, the comprehension should per- 
haps be tested by having each pupil state orally in his own words 
what he had read and by having a stenographic report of his state- 
ments. This method would entail much difficulty and require an 
enormous amount of time, as each child would have to be tested 
individually with the aid of a stenographer, and in the end it would 
probably be no better as an index of comprehension. The method 
of determining comprehension employed in our measurements of 
reading has been tested in various ways and found to be accurate 
as well as convenient. 
In order to determine the validity of these reading tests from a 
different angle, a comparison was made between the efficiency in 
reading as shown by the tests and the efficiency as indicated by the 
marks in reading assigned by the teachers. This comparison, 
made in a school of 256 pupils, showed a close agreement between 
the tests and the reading as estimated by the teachers. There is 
every reason for believing that the real reading capacity of a child 
is measured accurately by means of these tests, and far more accu- 
rately than by the most conscientious marking. 
A fourth point regarding the validity of the tests relates to the 
method of scoring comprehension ; namely, of counting the number of 
written words which correctly express the thought of the test passage. 
This method was adopted because it is simple, rapid and objective. 
Several other methods of scoring were tried out, but it was found that 
the method here used is accurate and reliable. In fact, it is fully as 
accurate as the combined judgment of ten competent teachers.

English Vocabulary Test.1_ A useful and important supplementary 
measurement of reading ability is a test for determining the com- 
prehension of individual words and the range of a person’s reading 
vocabulary. For this purpose the following test has been designed. 
It measures the percentage of words of the entire English vocab- 
ulary as well as the absolute number of words that a person under- 
stands. The test consists of several sets of 100 words each which 
were selected at uniform intervals from the entire English vocab- 
ulary. Each list of 100 was selected by taking the first word on 
every 23d page of Webster’s New International Dictionary (1910). 
List I contains the words from pages 23, 46, 69, etc., and list II 
from pages 24, 47, 70, etc. This method of selection yields a fair 
and representative sampling of the entire English vocabulary.

The test is given according to the specifications at the head of 
the sheet. A pupil’s score is the average number of words desig- 
nated correctly in the two lists. This score will be the percentage 
of words that he understands in the two lists as well as the percentage 
of words of the entite English vocabulary that he understands. 
An average of two lists will give an accurate measure of the size of 
a person’s reading vocabulary. The mean variation of the scores 
obtained from the two lists is approximately 2.5, indicating a rather 
high degree of accuracy. Greater accuracy can be obtained by 
testing with more than two sets, but that will rarely be needed. 
Additional test lists can be prepared by following the principle of 
selection employed in lists I and II.

as determined from tests made in four schools:

Individual Differences and the Overlapping of Grades. One of 
the most important, if not the most important, discovery of the recent 
measurements of efficiency in school studies, is the enormous range 
of differences in capacity shown by the pupils in the same class or 
grade. There is a tacit feeling that when a pupil is promoted to 
the next higher grade his capacity is distinctly superior to the aver- 
age ability of the pupils left behind, and that the pupils of any 
given grade, while not alike, are individually and collectively superior 
to the average or even to the better ones of the next lower grade. 
It is, therefore, most surprising to find that the abilities shown 
by the pupils of any grade, with the possible exception of the first 
and second, are distributed over the entire scale. For example, 
there are pupils in the fourth grade whose attainment in reading 
is higher than that of the average eighth-grade pupil. Likewise,
-P-A-G-E-49
  
THE MEASUREMENT OF ABILITY IN READING 41 
there are pupils in the fourth grade whose attainment in reading 
is inferior to that of the average first-grade pupil. 
To show these facts concretely, the distributions of the reading 
abilities of the pupils in each grade in a certain school are shown 
in the graphs of Fig. 12. These distribution curves are based on

Frc. 12.— The numbers along the base line represent scores for speed and comprehen- 
sion combined as expressed in terms of speed. The lowest curve represents the distribution 
of the pupils in the second grade, the next one for the third grade, etc. 
ing to the slide rule scale. It will be seen at a glance that the ranges 
of difference are astoundingly wide. The five best pupils in the 
second grade read as well as the seven poorest in the eighth grade. 
A study similar to that shown in Fig. 12 was made of all the 
grades in three schools, each in a different city. The results were 
identical in every respect with those shown in Fig. 12. The range of 
differences and the overlapping were just as large. Furthermore,
-P-A-G-E-50
fe, 
42 EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENTS 
it was found that, in speed and comprehension combined, 31.8 per 
cent of the pupils of any grade reached or exceeded the median of 
the next grade above, 20.1 per cent reached or exceeded the median 
of the second grade above, 13.2 per cent reached or exceeded the 
median of the third grade above, and 3.3 per cent reached or exceeded 
the median of the fourth grade above. In other words, one third 
of the pupils of any given grade could do the reading work of the 
next grade above as well as the average of that grade, one fifth could 
do the work of the second above it as well as the average of that 
grade, and one eighth could do the work of the third grade above 
it as well as the average of that grade. Likewise, corresponding 
percentages of pupils in any given grade are no more efficient in 
reading than the pupils one, two, or three grades below it. 
Should these differences be taken into account in our schools? 
Should the pupils be reclassified into higher or lower classes accord- 
ing to their capacities? The facts presented here reveal the situa- 
tion as it actually exists at the present time. 
Thorndike’s Reading Tests. Thorndike has prepared two read- 
ing tests, one for measuring ability in reading words and the other 
for reading sentences. The vocabulary test consists of a series of 
steps graded in uniformly increasing amounts of difficulty. Each 
step has five words of equal difficulty. These words were selected 
from a much larger list whose difficulty was determined experi- 
mentally by tests on a large number of children. A pupil’s score 
in the test is the number of the highest step passed, and a step is 
passed if not more than one of the five words is missed. 
The test is convenient, definite and easily scored. Its chief limi- 
tations are that it has a predominance of names of flowers and ani- 
mals, which would give undue advantage to some pupils; and that it 
has only five words in each step, which would be an advantage to 
some pupils and a disadvantage to others. Both of these defects 
may be remedied by modifications and additions of words. Scale 
A and scale Alpha measure comprehension primarily. They do not 
measure the other important element of reading, namely speed. 
The test for measuring the understanding of sentences is scored 
by determining how the questions are answered. A detailed system 
of scoring is outlined in the original monograph.

the teacher wishes done. But sometimes other duties 
prevent even the best boy or girl from doing so. If

such might be the case. A good girl might let her

It may seem at first thought that every boy and 
girl who goes to school ought to do all the work that 
the teacher wishes done. But sometimes other duties 
prevent even the best boy or girl from doing so. Ifa 
boy’s or girl’s father died and he had to work after- 
noons and evenings to earn money to help his mother, 
such might be the case. A good girl might let her 
lessons go undone in order to help her mother by tak-

Kansas Silent Reading Test.2, This test was devised by Professor 
F. J. Kelly for the purpose of measuring primarily comprehension 
of reading on the principle of simple responses to short paragraphs 
to indicate the correct or incorrect understanding of the passage. 
The chief advantage of the test is the simplicity of scoring the results. 
The chief disadvantages are that the test does not measure directly 
the speed of reading and that many of the passages tend to be chiefly 
exercises in reasoning or in solving puzzles. Nevertheless they will 
furnish undoubtedly important indices of ability in reading. 
Directions for Giving the Tests 
After telling the children not to open the papers, ask the 
children on the front seats to distribute the papers, placing one 
upon the desk of each pupil in the class. Have each child fill in 
the blank space at the top of this page. Then make clear the 
following :

This exercise tells us to draw a line around the word cow. No 
other answer is right. Even if a line is drawn under the word 
cow, the exercise is wrong, and counts nothing. The game con- 
sists of a lot of just such exercises, so it is wise to study each ex- 
ercise carefully enough to be sure that you know exactly what 
you are asked to do. The number of exercises which you can 
finish thus in five minutes will make your score, so do them as 
fast as you can, being sure to do them right. Stop at once when 
time is called. Do not open the papers until told, so that all may 
begin at the same time. 
The teacher should then be sure that each pupil has a good 
pencil or pen. Note the minute and second by the watch, and 
say, BEGIN. 
ALLOW EXACTLY FIVE MINUTES. 
Answer no questions of the pupils which arise from not under- 
standing what to do with any given exercise.

  CHAPTER V 
THE MEASUREMENT OF ABILITY IN WRITING 
Essential Elements in Writing. In measuring the efficiency of 
writing it is necessary to ascertain the essential constituents in the 
process. The two prime elements of handwriting which need to be 
measured in order to determine a person’s writing capacity are 
speed and quality, including under the latter legibility and form 
or general esthetic appearance. Other characteristics, such as 
individuality, size, style, slant, etc., are of little or no importance 
from the practical point of view of writing as a means of communica- 
tion, except in so far as they are factors in speed, quality or legibility. 
Methods of Measuring. The speed of writing may be measured 
rather easily by ascertaining the amount that can be written in a 
given period of time, let us say, the number of letters per minute. 
The quality of writing can be measured by either the Thorndike 
or the Ayres scale. The nature and derivation of these scales is 
described in the original sources. The Thorndike scale was con- 
structed from 1000 samples of writing, furnished by pupils in school. 
These samples were arranged in the order of merit by forty or more 
competent judges. This resulted in a scale of graded specimens 
ranging in quality from o to 18, the former being absolutely illegible 
writing, but recognizable as an attempt to write, and the latter 
being a perfect copybook model. A given specimen of writing is 
measured by putting it alongside the scale and determining to what 
quality it is nearest. 
The Ayres scale was constructed by measuring the speed of read- 
ing 1578 samples of children’s writing. The words in these samples 
were thrown out of their natural context. These specimens were 
then read by ten different persons, and an average reading time was 
computed for each sample. Typical specimens were selected from 
the entire group so as to represent eight degrees of legibility. The 
scale in its final form consists of three samples, slant, medium and 
60
-P-A-G-E-69
THE MEASUREMENT OF ABILITY IN WRITING 61 
vertical, for each of the eight degrees of legibility. The steps are 
designated as 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90. Measurements are 
made in the same manner as with the Thorndike scale. 
The convenience and accuracy of making measurements with these 
two scales are practically the same. To test their relative useful- 
ness as compared with the ordinary estimates of writing made on 
the percentage basis, fifteen samples of children’s writing were 
measured by twenty competent persons in three ways: (1) by the 
Thorndike scale, (2) by the Ayres scale and (3) by the ordinary 
percentile method. The results showed that the measurements 
made by either scale were of almost identical accuracy, and that 
both were much more accurate than the estimates made by the usual 
percentile plan. 
By using both scales for rating the same samples of writing the 
following equivalent values for the two scales have been determined. 
THORNDIKE AYRES 
ScaLe ScaLE 
Quality 7 isequalto 22 
Quality 8 isequalto 31 
Quality 9 isequalto 40 
Quality 10 is equal to 49 
Quality 11 isequalto 58 
Quality 12 isequalto 67 
Quality 13 isequalto 76 
Quality 14 is equalto 85 
The Ayres scale does not extend as far at the lower and upper 
limits as the Thorndike scale. The limits of the Ayres scale lie 
within qualities 7 and 14 on the Thorndike scale. Quite a number 
of pupils in the upper grades write better than quality 14 and about 
half of the pupils in the first and second grades write worse than 
quality 7. In this regard the Thorndike scale is preferable to the 
Ayres scale. 
Instructions for Administering the Tests. Explain to the pupils 
that they are to write repeatedly the line ‘‘ Mary had.a little lamb ” 
as well as they can and as rapidly as they can during the two minutes 
that will be allowed for the writing. 
Explain also that they are to write continuously without interrup- 
tion and to make no erasures or corrections. 
The pupils are to write with pen and ink on ruled paper. Before

making the test, have the pupils write at the top of the sheet the 
name, grade, school, city and the date. 
When all are ready, have them hold their pens up in the air and 
then give the signal “start.” Allow them exactly two minutes to 
write over as many times as they can ‘‘ Mary had a little lamb.” 
Both speed and quality of writing count in this test. 
If desired, a different sentence may be used instead of “ Mary 
had a little lamb.” The sentence must not contain more than five 
to seven words, which must all be familiar to the children. The 
pupils, however, must not have received previous drill upon it. 
The sentence “‘ Art is long and time is fleeting,” or any short sentence 
may be used. 
N.B.— Make use of allowing exactly two minutes. See that 
all start and stop at the same time. 
The time limit of two minutes is chosen because it is long enough 
to yield an adequate sample of writing and not too long to produce 
fatigue. In order to have an adequate test of speed it is necessary 
to use something that can be written from memory. Either copying 
or dictating would interfere with the natural speed of writing. 
Instructions for Scoring the Tests. The samples of writing are 
scored for speed and quality. The speed of writing is determined 
‘by ascertaining the number of letters written per minute. The 
quality is measured either with the Thorndike scale or with the 
Ayres by what is called the ascending-descending procedure. That 
is, a group of thirty or forty samples is taken and each one is graded 
by beginning at the lower end of the scale and ascending until the 
quality is reached to which the sample is judged equal. After the 
entire group has been rated in this manner, each sample is judged 
again by beginning at the upper end of the scale and descending until 
equivalence is reached. The examiner should, of course, not know 
or see what the first measurement was. The average of these two 
determinations is taken as the final measurement. It is believed 
that this method yields considerably more accurate measurements 
than a single rating does. 
The following are the standard scores, based on over 6000 pupils 
in 28 schools, for the ends of the respective years. The graphs in 
Fig. 13 represent the standard scores.

It is desirable to express a pupil’s writing ability in a single score 
which combines speed and quality. On the principle set forth in the 
preceding chapter whereby speed of reading and comprehension 
 
-P-A-G-E-92

were made mutually convertible, speed and quality of writing may 
be expressed in terms. of each other. We shall assume for this 
purpose that the growth in speed of writing from the first grade to 
the eighth is equal in value to the parallel growth in quality during 
the same time. The gain in speed of 63 letters per minute, from 20 
in the first grade to 83 in the eighth grade, will be regarded cv to 
the gain of 4.4 steps (Thorndike scale), from 6.5 in the first grade to 
10.9 in the eighth grade. On this basis, the slide-rule scale in Fig. 
14 has been prepared. A pupil whose speed of writing is 41 letters 
per minute and whose quality of writing is 10 (Thorndike scale) 
would have a single score of 56 in terms of speed or 9 in terms of 
quality. This is obtained by finding 41 on the scale for speed and 
  io on the scale for quality. The number on the speed scale opposite 
tois 70. The average of 70 and 41 is 56. In the same manner the 
ratings by the Ayres scale may be converted into equivalent units 
on the Thorndike scale, and vice versa. 
The efficiency of a given pupil, grade or school can be represented 
most simply by a graph as shown in Fig. 15. 
Individual Differences and the Overlapping of Grades. In con- 
nection with the reading test in the preceding chapter, we saw the ex- 
tremely wide ranges of reading abilities in the various grades and the 
large amount of overlapping of the abilities of the pupils in one 
grade over the abilities of the pupils in adjacent grades. Exactly 
the same situation obtains in writing. 
The wide range in each grade and the amount of overlapping of 
successive grades in quality of writing are shown in Fig. 16 for the 
pupils of three schools in city A. The curves in this figure repre- 
sent the distribution of the pupils in each grade. They are all 
drawn on the same base line, so that a direct comparison can be 
made. The numbers along the base line are qualities of the 
Thorndike scale. 
The pupils in the first grade range all the way from quality 4 to 
quality 11.5. The pupils in the eighth grade range from quality 7 
to quality 15. There are five pupils in the first grade who write as 
well as the average in the eighth grade. 
The most realistic impression of the enormous amount of over- 
lapping can be gotten from an inspection of the curves themselves.

Freeman’s Writing Scales.1_ Freeman has prepared a series of five 
short scales each for rating one of five characteristics of writing, uni- 
formity of slant, uniformity of alignment, quality of line, letter forma- 
tion, and spacing. Each scale is composed of three sets of samples 
representing three steps of merit in its particular element of writing. 
These scales will be found useful when ratings of detailed character- 
istics are desired. They ought to be extended by additional steps of 
higher and lower merit.

Instructions for Administering the Tests. The test words for 
spelling are composed of six lists of one hundred words each. 
First have the pupils write the name, grade, school, city, and 
date at the top of the sheet. 
Pronounce the words clearly, but do not sound them phonetically, 
or inflect them so as to aid the pupils. Give the meaning of words 
that sound like words with a different meaning and spelling. The 
pupils are to write the words and to number them in the order in 
which they are given. Allow sufficient time for the writing. 
Each grade is to be tested twice, on two successive days. Use any 
one of the six lists given below on the first day and a different list on 
the second. In the first grade use the first 40 words of the list, in 
the second grade use the first 65 words, in the third grade use the 
first 80 words, in the fourth grade use the first 90 words, and in 
grades five to eight use the entire list. (When an entire school is 
being tested it may be desirable, though not necessary, to use on the 
first day the same list, say list 1, in all grades and any other list on 
the second day.) 
Instructions for Scoring the Tests. The tests are scored by check- 
ing off all words spelled incorrectly and then counting the number 
of words spelled correctly. This number is the score and also the 
percentage of words correct, since the lists contain 100 words each. 
An average is taken of the scores made in the two tests, which is the 
final score for each pupil. Omitted words are counted as incorrect. 
Words that may be spelled in different ways are counted correct if 
they are spelled according to any of the permissible ways. In the 
lower grades the pupils are unable to spell the omitted parts of the 
lists. They are therefore counted as incorrect.

total of 1186 words. From these all technical, scientific and obsolete 
words were discarded, which left 612 words. Finally, 12 other 
words which approached most closely to being technical or obsolete 
were discarded, so as to leave 600 words. These were then arranged 
alphabetically in the order of size, beginning with 3-letter words, 
4-letter words, etc., down to the longest words. This list was then 
divided into six lists of 100 words each by choosing for the first list, 
the 1st, 7th, 13th, etc.; for the second list, the 2d, 8th, r4th, etc.; 
for the third list, the 3d, 9th, 15th, etc.; for the fourth list, the 4th, 
oth, 16th, etc.; for the fifth list, the 5th, 11th, 17th, etc.; and for 
the sixth list, the 6th, 12th, 18th, etc. 
The reasons for selecting the words on this particular basis were: 
(1) It would give a random sampling of the entire non-technical 
English vocabulary. Familiar or unfamiliar words, large or small 
words, hard or difficult words, would all be included in the test lists 
in the same proportions in which they occur in the entire vocabulary. 
(2) This selection would give a list including a fair sampling of very 
easy and very difficult words, so that it could be used for testing 
the spelling capacity of the beginner as well as that of the expert 
speller. (3) It would yield a list sufficiently large for testing ade- 
quately any child’s spelling ability. (4) It would give a list that 
could be duplicated in the same manner by any one else, if, for some 
reason, it should be desired to have a different but comparable list. 
Similar lists of 100 words each could be constructed, for example, 
by selecting the 2d, 3d or any other word on the even- or odd-numbered 
pages of Webster’s New International Dictionary and then discard- 
ing words in the manner described above so as to leave 600 words. 
(5) The particular score that a pupil makes in the test has a definite 
meaning in that it indicates the percentage of words of the entire 
non-technical English vocabulary that he is able to spell. If a 
pupil can spell 50 words out of any list, he can spell 50 per cent of 
the non-technical vocabulary or approximately 26,000 words. 
The validity of this method of measuring spelling ability has been 
examined from various angles. Experimentation has shown that
-P-A-G-E-105
THE MEASUREMENT OF ABILITY IN SPELLING 97 
the spelling ability of any individual pupil can be ascertained accu- 
rately by the use of any two lists, preferably at two different times. 
If a pupil is tested with one list at one time and soon afterwards with 
a second list, the two scores will differ from each other by a mean 
variation of only 2.2 points. 
To ascertain in another way the reliability of the tests, a compari- 
son was made between the ability in spelling as measured for each 
pupil by two lists and the marks assigned by the teachers to the pupils

for the year’s work in spelling. Coefficients of correlation were com- 
puted between the teachers’ marks and the test scores. These were 
found to be high and indicated a close agreement between the scores 
in the tests and the teachers’ estimates of the pupils’ achievement in 
spelling, even at the end of a whole year of instruction and observation. 
Further experiments were made to determine the relative diffi- 
culty of the six lists. For practical purposes the differences among 
the six lists are negligible.

The overlapping among the various grades is enormous. There

in the eighth grade. Other comparisons of a similar kind can be 
made. On the average 20.8 per cent of the pupils in any grade reach 
or exceed the median of the next grade above it, and 6.2 per cent 
reach or exceed the median of the second grade above it.

  THE MEASUREMENT OF ABILITY IN SPELLING 99 
pared after much experimentation as a spelling test, is composed of 
the rooo most common words. The nature and use of the lists are 
stated by Ayres as follows: 
All the words in each column are of approximately equal spelling difficulty. 
The steps in spelling difficulty from each column to the next are approximately 
equal steps. The numbers at the top indicate about what per cent of correct 
spellings may be expected among the children of the different grades. For 
example, if 20 words from column H are given as a spelling test it may be ex- 
pected that the average score for an entire second grade spelling them will be 
about 79 per cent. For a third grade it should be about 92 per cent, for a fourth 
grade about 98 per cent, and for a fifth grade about 100 per cent. 
The limits of the groups are as follows: 50 means from 46 through 54 per 
cent; 58 means from 55 through 62 per cent; 66 means from 63 through 69 per 
cent; 73 means from 70 through 76 per cent; 79 means from 77 through 81 
per cent; 84 means from 82 through 86 per cent; 88 means from 87 through 90 
per cent; 92 means from 91 through 93 per cent; 94 means 94 and 95 per cent; 
96 means 96 and 97 per cent; while 98, 99 and 100 per cent are separate groups. 
By means of these groupings a child’s spelling ability may be located in terms 
of grades. Thus if a child were given a 20 word spelling test from the words of 
column O and spelled 15 words, or 75 per cent of them, correctly it would be 
proper to say that he showed fourth grade spelling ability. If he spelled cor- 
rectly 17 words, or 85 per cent, he would show fifth grade ability, and so on. 
Ayres’ Short List. This list is composed of a set of ten words for 
each grade from the second, to the eighth. Each set of ten was so 
selected, on the basis of previous tests, that seven out of ten children 
of a grade on an average can spell correctly all the words designed for 
that grade. The lists are as follows: 
2D 3D 4TH STH 6TH 7TH 818 
GRADE GRADE GRADE GRADE GRADE GRADE GRADE 
foot fill forty several decide district petrified 
get . point rate leaving general consideration tariff 
for state children publish manner athletic emergency 
horse ready prison o'clock too distinguish corporation 
cut. almost title running automobile evidence convenience 
well high getting known victim conference receipt 
name event need. secure hospital amendment cordially 
room, done throw wait neither liquor discussion 
left pass feel manner toward experience appreciate 
with Tuesday speak flight business receive decision 
There are, however, three points that should be considered. (1) 
The lists are so small that the chance of familiarity or unfamiliarity 
on the part of individual pupils with these particular words is rather 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  100 EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENTS 
large. The result is that, while the words no doubt have validity 
for testing a grade or class as a whole, they are apt to be quite unre- 
liable as a test of individual pupils. (2) Asa result of the manner 
in which the words were selected, they are sure to be too easy for 
the better pupils of each grade, and hence they would not test the 
spelling ability of such pupils. By definition, seven out of ten pupils 
can spell correctly all the words assigned to their grade. 
Buckingham’s List. Buckingham selected, on the basis of a 
series of tests, two lists of twenty-five words each of known difficulty. 
These are arranged on a scale of increasing value as follows: 
  1st List 2p List 
only freeze chicken against 
even _ forty butcher circus 
smoke wear Tuesday guess 
front | minute answer telephone 
another _ pear taise choose 
lesson button beautiful telegram 
bought _ janitor instead saucy 
pretty sword tailor already 
nails whistle tying pigeons 
sure stopping towel beginning 
nor | carriage tobacco grease 
cousin saucer whole too 
touch quarrel 
The relative values of these words have been determined quite accu- 
rately. Achild’s spelling capacity would be measured by determining 
the number of words he can spell correctly and then assigning to 
him a score on the basis of the values of the words spelled. Criti- 
cisms (1) and (2) made in connection with the Ayres short list apply 
here also. The words are too easy for the better pupils even as far 
down as the fourth grade. In the upper grades more and more of 
the pupils can spell correctly all the words in the list until in the eighth 
grade more than half of the pupils can spell all of the words correctly. 
The list should be extended by selecting words of greater difficulty.

CHAPTER VII 
THE MEASUREMENT OF ABILITY IN ENGLISH GRAMMAR 
THE measurement of achievement in English grammar may be 
attacked from two angles. We may proceed to measure knowledge 
of formal grammar on the one hand, or ability to use the English 
language correctly on the other. Measurements for both phases 
have been prepared. The scales for measuring usage will be de- 
scribed first and the tests for knowledge of technical grammar after- 
wards. 
Scales for Measuring Usage 
The two chief elements of usage, aside from composition, are 
undoubtedly grammatical correctness and punctuation. Accordingly, 
a scale has been prepared for measuring grammatical correctness 
and one for measuring ability in punctuation. 
GRAMMATICAL SCALE A? 
(Prepared by D. Starch) 
Each of the following sentences gives in parenthesis two ways 
in which it may be stated. Cross out the one that you think is 
incorrect or bad. If you think both are incorrect cross both out. 
If you think both are correct underline both.

Scoring the Test. The scale is composed of a series of increasing 
steps of equal differences of difficulty. A pupil’s rating on the 
scale is the highest step passed and a step is passed if not more than 
one of the four sentences is missed. In case a pupil passes all the 
steps up to a certain point and then fails on one but passes additional 
steps beyond that point, he is credited with all the additional steps 
passed. For example, if a pupil passes all steps up to and includ- 
ing the 8th and fails on all beyond the 8th, his score will be 8. But 
if he fails on the gth, passes the roth, and then fails on the rest, his 
score willbe 9. He is credited with all additional steps passed. This 
sort of a record occurs about once in five and is due to the fact that 
there are only four sentences in each step. If there were ten or twelve 
sentences in each step such a record would rarely if ever occur. The 
reasons for regarding a step passed if 3 of the 4 sentences are marked 
correctly, that is, 75 per cent of them, will be obvious to all who are
-P-A-G-E-114
104 EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENTS | 
familiar with the principles underlying the psychological methods 
of measuring thresholds. | 
Derivation of the Scale. Grammatical scale A was derived ex- 
perimentally by preparing a test sheet containing 100 sentences of 
a similar nature as those in the scale. A test was then conducted 
with over 1000 pupils in six schools in various parts of the country 
distributed about evenly through the upper four grades the four 
years of the high school and the university. These tests were scored 
and tabulated to show the percentage of times each sentence was 
marked correctly. 
On the basis of these percentages of correctness, the sentences for 
scale A were selected as described elsewhere. Four sentences which 
conformed to the required percentages of correctness for each step, 
were selected and arranged in the form of scale A. The sentences, 
of course, do not have absolutely these values, but they were selected 
to conform as closely as possible. In no case, however, does a sen- 
tence deviate more than .2 of a step from its required value. The 
scale runs down only as far as step 5 because there were no sentences 
in the original test blank sufficiently easy to fit the required percent- 
ages of correctness for lower steps. Some of the upper steps have 
fewer than four sentences because there were not enough sentences 
of the proper degree of difficulty to fit into these higher steps.. The 
scale, however, as it stands is sufficiently easy at the lower end to 
measure adequately the ability of pupils in the lower grades and 
sufficiently difficult at the upper end to measure adequately the ability 
of university seniors. 
Advantages, Limitations and Improvements of the Scale. The 
limitations of the scale are the incompleteness of the steps at the 
upper and lower ends and the fact of having only four sentences for 
each step. The former limitation is of minor importance since the 
scale in its present form is sufficiently extensive to measure a very 
wide range of ability. The scale will be extended at both ends by 
further experimentation so as to add sentences of the required degrees 
of difficulty. 
The second limitation can be overcome experimentally by finding 
additional sentences for each step. This has been done by prepar- 
ing scales B and C with corresponding steps of identical degrees  
-P-A-G-E-115
    
    
   
         THE MEASUREMENT OF ABILITY IN ENGLISH GRAMMAR 105 
of difficulty. Scales B and C were constructed by the same process 
as scale A. The sentences in scales B and C, however, ‘do not fit 
into their respective steps as accurately as those in scale A. While 
each group of 4 sentences as a whole is very nearly identical in diffi- 
culty with the corresponding steps in scale A, some individual sen- 
tences deviate .3 of a step from the specified values.

The advantage in the three scales is that whenever a more accu- 
rate measurement is desired than that afforded bya single test, more 
than one scale may be used and an average of the scores taken. 
Another advantage in having several commensurate scales is the 
measurement of progress of the same class of pupils from time to 
time by using a different scale each time. As a matter of fact, 
. 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
  108 EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENTS } 
progress may be measured very accurately by using the same scale 
at different times, providing that no drilling or coaching on the scale 
is done. Without specific instruction on the material of the scales, 
they may be used repeatedly with the same class without appre- 
ciable error. The following situation ‘illustrates how little effect 
even definite knowledge of the correctness of the various sentences 
has upon the results of repeated tests. A class of 65 university jun- 
iors and seniors went through the test and scored according to a key 
their own papers and from 6 to 10 other papers each. Three weeks 
later the test was repeated, with the result that the average score of 
the class was only half a step higher than in the first test. When 
specific knowledge about the material of the scale produces so little 
difference after only three weeks, it seems very improbable that the 
performance of the test without further reference to it will have any 
appreciable effect whatever upon a repetition of the test after an 
interval of several weeks or months. 
Standards of Attainment. On the basis of tests made in four 
schools, the following tentative standards of attainment for the ends 
of the respective years have been obtained.

The scale for punctuation was derived by a process of experimen- 
tation and computation entirely identical with that by which the 
grammatical scales were derived. The original test with a larger 
set of sentences was made with the same groups of pupils as the 
grammatical tests, over 1000 in all. The number and percentage 
of times each sentence was punctuated correctly was then computed, 
and the selection of sentences for the scale was made on the same 
principles as for the grammatical scales. 
The scoring is done in the same manner as with the grammatical 
scales. A step is passed if at least three of the four sentences are 
punctuated correctly. If any mark is inserted incorrectly or is 
missing, the entire sentence is considered a failure. | 
With regard to use, advantages, limitations and improvements 
of the punctuation scale, the statements made in connection with 
the grammatical scales apply here equally well, and hence need not 
be repeated. 
The following are tentative standard scores of attainment for the 
ends of the respective school years : |

Tests for Measuring Grammatical Knowledge 
The technical knowledge of grammar is perhaps more difficult 
to measure than usage on account of its complexity. Adequate 
tests should cover the chief parts of the field. Three types of tests 
will be described. They do not cover all phases of grammar, but 
they measure several important divisions. 
GRAMMAR TEST 1. PARTS OF SPEECH. SCORE------ 
Indicate the parts of speech in the following text by placing above each word 
the abbreviation for its part of speech. Work as rapidly as possible. Do not

Maggie’s eyes had begun to sparkle and her cheeks to flush — she was 
really beginning to instruct the gypsies and gaining great influence over them. 
The gypsies themselves were not without amazement at this talk, though 
their attention was divided by the contents of Maggie’s pocket, which the 
friend at her right hand by this time emptied without attracting her notice. 
“Is that where you live, my little lady?” said the old woman at the mention 
of Columbus. 
“Oh, no!” said Maggie, with some pity; ‘‘Columbus was a very wonder- 
ful man who found out half the world, and they put chains on him and treated 
him very badly, you know —it’s in my catechism of geography but perhaps 
it’s rather too long to tell before tea.” 
“Yes, my home is pretty, and I’m very fond of the river where we go fish- 
ing; but I’m often very unhappy. I should have liked to bring my books 
with me, but I came away in a hurry, you know. But I can tell you almost 
everything there is in my books, I’ve read them so many times, and that will 
amuse you. And I can tell you something about geography, too — that’s 
about the world we live in — very useful and interesting.” 
This test is scored by determining the number of words designated 
correctly. If a word may be designated in different ways, it is 
counted correct if it is permissible according to good authority. For 
example, Maggie’s is considered correct if it is marked as either noun 
or adjective. 
The following are provisional standard scores of achievement 
for the ends of the various school years.

After crossing the gully and walking on through the woods for what they 
thought a safe distance, they turned into the path. They were talking very 
merrily about the General and Hugh and their friend Mills, and were discuss- 
ing some romantic plan for the recapture of their horses from the enemy 
when they came out of the path into the road, and found themselves within 
twenty yards of a group of Federal soldiers, quietly sitting on their horses, 
evidently guarding the road. 
“Where are you boys going?” he asked, as he came up to them. 
“Going home.” : 
“Where do you belong?”’ 
“Over there — at Oakland,” pointing in the direction of their home, which 
seemed suddenly to have moved a thousand miles away. 
“Where have you been?”’ The other soldiers had come up now. 
“Been down this way.’’ The boys’ voices were never so meek before. 
Each reply was like an apology. 
“Been to see your brother?” asked one who had not spoken before — a 
pleasant-looking fellow. The boys looked at him. They were paralyzed by 
dread of the approaching question. 
“Now, boys, we know where you have been,”’ said a small fellow, who wore 
a yellow chevron on his arm. He had a thin mustache and a sharp nose, and 
rode a wiry, dull, sorrel horse. ‘You may just as well tell us all about it. 
We know you have seen them, and we are going to make you carry us where 
they are.” 
This test is scored by determining the total number of nouns and 
pronouns designated correctly. The following are provisional stand- 
ard scores.

breviations.

A tense or a mode given correctly counts as one point. Every 
verb form for which both are given correctly counts as two points. 
The total number designated correctly constitutes the score. The

Limitations and Improvements of the Tests. The two chief limi- 
tations of these tests are, first, the failure to cover all phases of 
grammatical knowledge and, second, the counting of any designa- 
tion of a part of speech, case, tense or mode as equal to any other. 
The former shortcoming may be overcome by adding other tests 
of a similar nature to cover the remaining aspects of grammatical 
knowledge. A test on sentence analysis or diagramming ought 
very likely to be added. The second limitation may be remedied by 
scaling the values of the various designations. In spite of these 
limitations, which fundamentally are not of a serious character, 
these tests provide quite accurate measures of grammatical knowledge 
and are far more accurate than ordinary methods of testing and mark- 
ing. These limitations are pointed out here because it is important 
to recognize in a fair way what the defects of any scale or test are, 
since the ultimate usefulness of any measuring instrument depends 
upon its degree of accuracy.

  CHAPTER VIII 
THE MEASUREMENT OF ABILITY IN ARITHMETIC 
Arithmetical Scale. Arithmetical ability consists essentially of 
the capacity to analyze a concrete problem and to carry out correctly 
the required operations. Hence any complete measurement of 
ability in arithmetic ought to measure capacity for reasoning and 
facility in at least the four fundamental operations. | 
A scale for measuring arithmetical ability has been prepared on 
the same principles as the grammatical scales. The arithmetical 
scale is composed of a series of steps of regularly increasing difficulty. 
The problems for these steps were determined experimentally and 
located according to their percentages of correctness. A pupil’s score 
is the highest step done correctly. If a pupil passes all steps up to 
and including the eighth, and fails on all beyond that, his score is 
eight. If he fails on nine and does ten and fails on the rest his score 
is nine. That is, he is credited with each additional step passed 
beyond where he first failed.

The chief criticism to be brought against this set of tests ae (2) 
The fact that only single number combinations are used in testing 
the fundamental operations, which does not take into account the 
process of carrying and of adding longer columns. This may be an 
advantage for testing the lower grades. (2) The reasoning tests lay

of speed in reading and grasping the problems. (3) The use of the 
same test material for all grades will not measure adequately the 
ability of the lower and upper grades. It is very likely too difficult 
for the younger pupils and too easy for the older pupils. The tests,

  CHAPTER IX 
THE MEASUREMENT OF ABILITY IN ENGLISH COMPOSITION 
Two scales have been prepared for the measurement of merit. 
or quality of English compositions: the Hillegas-Thorndike scale 
and the Harvard-Newton scale. The Hillegas-Thorndike scale 
was prepared on the same general principles as the Thorndike hand- 
writing scale. A large number of compositions by young people 
were rated in the order of merit as estimated by competent persons. 
The scale as it stands is composed of a series of steps ranging in quality 
from o to 95 with one or more samples for each quality. A composi- 
tion is rated according to the scale by determining to what step on 
the scale it is most nearly equal. 
Directions for Administering and Scoring the Test. The pupils 
are to write with pen and ink on regular, ruled paper. They should 
put at the top of the sheet the name, grade, school, city and date. 
Subject for composition: “The Season of the Year that I like Best 
and Why.” (Some other suitable subject may be used if it seems 
desirable.) 
Time: Allow a minute or two for questions and for writing the 
name, etc., at the top of the page. 
Then allow the pupils fifteen minutes to write the composition. No 
suggestions or help should be given. 
The compositions are then scored by the Hillegas-Thorndike scale 
or, if preferred, by the Harvard-Newton scale. 
The results of a class should be tabulated to show the name of each 
pupil together with his score, and the average score for the entire 
class.

How tobacco is that it is to expensive to ship the tobacco over 
to the northern states and by frieght it is cheaper because they 
do not have to cross the water and they do not send it so quick. 
The men that send the bales of tobacco get more than all of the 
tobacco is worth. And because they charge to dear is they take 
to much pains with it and sell it dear. And some times the noursis- 
ment gets to dry that they buy more of the land for the tobacco and 
that they can raise more of it. The people have tobacco fields are 
very glad to have railways cut through thier fields because they do 
not have to go far to them. Because this change has been made is 
just what I have been telling you and that is why bettween the

De Quincy. 
First: De Quincys mother was a beautiful women and through 
her De Quincy inhereted much of his genius. 
His running away from school enfluenced him much as he roamed 
through the woods, valleys and his mind became very meditative. 
The greatest enfluence of De Quincy’s life was the opium habit. 
If it was not for this habit it is doubtful whether we would now be 
reading his writings. 
His companions during his college course and even before that 
time were great enfluences. The surroundings of De Quincy were 
enfluences. Not only De Quincy’s habit of opium but other habits 
which were peculiar to his life.

At the time of a Revolution and general tumult the people needed 
something to turn their attentions and Paine’s arrival seemed to 
be the very help for it. In England he had been known to express 
his opinions openly and now in America he did the same thing. He 
made a success of his magazine ‘‘ Common Sense from the very out- 
start for it was inside exactly what the name implied. He raised 
good sane arguments that others before him had only felt but dared 
not to write of them. It was soon the most popular thing read, not 
only here but also abroad in many of the colonies. The authorship 
for a time was thought to be Samuel or John Adams or Dr. Franklin, 
but it soon became known that Paine was the author. This created 
violent hate amongst the Tories and they were always writing against 
different articles that appeared in the ‘‘Common Sense. Never- 
theless the reputation of the magazine was rather increased than 
lessened by these protestations of the Tories Paine died a penniless 
patriot although he had gained a great name for himself. 
A University out west, I cannot, remember the name, is noted 
for its hazing, and this is what the story is about. It is the hazing 
of a freshman. There was a freshman there who had been acting 
as if he didn’t respect his upper class men so they decided to teach 
him a lesson. The student brought before the Black Avenger’s 
which is a society in all college to keep the freshman under there 
tules so they desided to take him to the rail-rode track and tie him 
to the rails about two hours before a train was suspected and leave 
him there for about an hour, which was a hour before the 9.20 train 
was expected. The date came that they planned this hazing for 
so the captured the fellow blindfolded him and lead him to the rail 
rode tracks, where they tied him. :

Common Sense. 
A pamphlet written by Payne shortly after the Pennsylvania 
Rebeliion. Dr. Franklin introduced the author as a young man 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
  136 EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENTS 
when he came to Philadelphia but he had left behind him in Eng- 
land a ruined career. This may be due to the times in which he 
lived. There was no demand for the ideas of a humble man and 
had he tried to create a demand it is likely he would have heard a 
good deal from the kings officers. 
Although Franklin asked that he be put in the way of obtaining 
a clerkship, he turned his attention to literature, and his articles 
were the making of a magazine just started in Philadelphia. He 
had the courage of his convictions. The pamphlet dealth with the 
conditions of the times. The absurdity of being dependent on a 
country sofar away. There was a time when it was right and proper. 
That time was now past. The book made a great impression on 
the Colonists and also on the people abroad. Payne realized that 
if men were to fight they must understand the reason. 
The authorship was questioned several prominent names being 
associated with its authorship 
Payne received no compensation except celebrity. 
Deephagen. 
Deephagen, one of the small New England towns was situated 
on the coast. The town was barren and the wind swept over the 
place all winter long. Scarcely a person could be seen anywhere’s 
around out of doors. The leaves had fallen all over the place and 
the town gave us a picture of an old, desolate, forlorn place. The 
homes of the people were scattered here and there and one could tell 
that the occupation of the people were either farmers or fishermen 
by the looks of the old, shut-up houses. 
In summer, the town although not American was more full of

there was also a hustle and bustle of fishermen around the town. 
The houses were open and the trees all around the place were in full

lonesome.

Next I would donate a part of this sum to the charity organization, 
and I should then have a large enough amount left to make a visit 
during the holidays. The visit which I would like to take would 
be down through the southern part of Indiana, then out to the large 
farm house of my aunts, where I would eat of a large turkey and all 
the other good things that go with it. 
I would make use of my money in this way so that I myself would 
be pleased and at the same time I would be pleasing my friend. 
And with the amount which I gave to the charity organization would 
please some who had no friends and others who could not afford 
to buy any thing to make them happy.

“Common Sense.” 
Thomas Paine came to America in 1774, at the close of the Pennsyl- 
vania Revolution. He had been ejected from his position in England 
because he gave his political opinions too positively there. He 
came to America with a letter from Dr. Franklin, asking his friends 
to find the young man a position as clerk, teacher, or something of 
that kind. But Paine decided to turn his attention to literature. 
His articles were the making of the Pennsylvania Magazine, and he

soon became editor of it. He conducted the magazine very stuccess- 
fully, writing articles on many subjects, especially those of novel 
and often unpopular principles. He wrote on matters of church, 
divorce, duelling, the ill-treatment of animals, international arbi- 
tration and many other subjects. 
In January, 1776, a pamphlet appeared which occasioned a great 
stir. It was called “Common Sense ” and contained all the merits

Deephaven. 
Deephaven was not a thriving overcrowded town possessed with 
the American spirit. It did not have “hurry” or the dollar bill 
sign as its watch-word, as does New York City. On the contrary 
it. was a lonely receeding unprogressive town in New England. Its 
men were not ambitious men of the Napoleonic type nor were they 
Miltons nor Cromwells. Most of the male population claimed the 
occupation of fishing, as a means of livelihood. The town was situ- 
ated on the coast. At great intervals a schooner might dock at 
Deephaven to load with hay or fire wood. 
In the winter time dreary Deephaven was the dreariest of dreary, 
dismal towns. The leafless trees sighed and maoned as the wind 
whistled past them. The deserted warves did not present a cheer- 
ful appearance for all was still as death. Rheumatism claimed 
many victims. Once cheery sea-captains now were “blue and 
gloomy.” 
Criticism. 
“The Thing that Couldn’t ” by Margaret Cameron, in the De- 
cember Harpers is a clever little love story telling how a letter was 
sent, by mistake, to a man who it was absolutely necessary should 
not see it and regained by a trick. The story is exciting and holds 
the readers interest from the beginning because of the clear. witty 
way in which it is told. The narrative is never so long that interest 
flags, nor so brief that important points are omitted and in this 
way unity is retained. Conversation is mingled with the narra- 
tion in a way that serves to make the story more interesting and 
only in one or two places where definite details are needed is any 
description used.

Fourteenth Century Costumes. 
The costumes of the fourteenth century were very pecular. Rich 
men and high officials were clothed in the most expensive silks and 
satins, often wearing wide trousers, which were composed of vari- 
ous colors. A bright colored cloke, often of the same material as 
the trousers, was thrown over the sholders. The women of this 
class dressed as extravigantly as the men. Dresses of bright colors, 
with long sweaping trains, were the custom. The headdress of this 
time was very peculiar, in that it was very high. Sometimes reach- 
ing the high of two feet. 
The dress of the middle class was very much modified, although 
the colors were bright still the material was not as expensive. The 
men wore uniforms, signifying to which gild they belonged or what 
was their trade. 
Cheep, course, cloth was used for clothing by the lower class. 
They were dressed as simply as possible because they could not 
afford better clothes. 
The dress of the church men differed according to the station of 
the man. The richer churchmen wore more expensive clothing even 
than the nobles, while the condition of the lower clergy would not 
allow expensive clothes. 
I am going to Princeton partly because it was my father’s college. 
I also prefer to go to a college away from home. You get the college 
life much more that way. My main reason is on account of the 
great advantages held forth in the preceptorial system. The pre- 
ceptorial system is organized as follows. Imagine a class, junior 
for example of perhaps three hundred; divided into sections of twenty 
five each. For each of these sections there are six preceptors, men 
engaged to head groups of four or five to talk over their work with 
them and give them points and-suggestions about it. The advantage 
of this is that the man gets a great deal more individual attention in 
this manner than he otherwise would. Princeton has high standards 
of intellectuality as well as athletics.

Going Down with Victory. 
As we road down Lombard Street, we saw flags waving from 
nearly every window. I surely felt proud that day to be the driver 
of the gaily decorated coach. Again and again we were cheered as 
we drove slowly to the postmasters, to await the coming of his maj- 
estie’s mail. There wasn’t one of the gaily bedecked coaches that 
could have compared with ours, in my estimation. So with waving 
flags and fluttering hearts we waited for the coming of the mail and 
the expected tidings of victory. 
When at last it did arrive the postmaster began to quickly sort 
the bundles, we waited anxiously. Immediately upon receiving 
our bundles, I lashed the horses and they responded with a jump. 
Out into the country we drove at reckless speed — everywhere spread- 
ing like wildfire the news, “‘ Victory!’’ The exileration that we all 
felt was shared with the horses. Up and down grade and over 
bridges, we drove at breakneck speed and spreading the news at every 
hamlet with that one cry “ Victory!” When at last we were back 
home again, it was with the hope that we should have another ride 
some day with ‘“ Victory.”

“ Common Sense.” 
This pamphlet was a pointed argument against absolute mon- 
archy and tyrannical government. It was an enthusiastic and 
thetorical expression of the thoughts, emotions, and ideas of the 
majority of the American people. Its very nature appealed to 
them and a copy of it could be found in almost every American 
home. So very popular did it become that even the people of 
Europe became interested in it and caused it to be translated into 
many European languages. This is more remarkable when we 
consider that European interest in American affairs was a thing 
which seldom occurred during colonial times. Paine like many 
other famous men received no material reward, but his memory 
is held dear in the hearts of present-day American citizens.

Deephaven. 
Deephaven was a little town on the coast of New England, but 
one would hardly believe it was American. It seemed more like 
a little old. English village, quiet, dull, and sleepy. There were 
no manufacturies, so the few inhabitants spent their time on their 
little fishing sloops. The houses were old weather-beaten cottages ; 
no one knew when the last one had been built. Once or twice a 
year a boat came to load lumber there; but Deephaven had once 
been a prosperous town, as the deserted warehouses on the wharves 
showed. 
In winter Deephaven was even more desolate than in summer. 
The ground was bare and rocky, the trees leafless, except for the 
oaks which are the most mournful growing things when their dry 
leaves rustle and whisper in the wind. The houses were all closed 
as tightly as possible and there were few people who dared venture 
outside their doors. Once in a while one would see some old sea 
captain, who was braver than the others, roll along the street, brac- 
ing himself against the powerful wind. You could always tell him 
by his big reefer with the enormous bone buttons and big flaps over 
the pockets. 
All the flowers in the gardens were black with frost except the 
few pansies which were sometimes found under the sheltered china- 
astor stalks 
Choosing a College. 
Of the many points which should be taken into consideration 
in choosing a college, one of the most important is that of the size 
of the institution. I am of the opinion that it should be rather 
small; that is, with an undergraduate body of about two hundred 
and fifty students. There are a number of reasons for this. In 
the first place, in a small college like this, a student who has excep- 
tional powers in any branch of interests has more opportunity 
to come to the fore, and make the most of himself. For example, 
if a man is an unusually good runner, although he does not know 
it, and has not been well-developed, if he is in a small college, he is 
more likely to go out for track and find out what he can do, than if 
he is in a large university, discouraged by the great number of
-P-A-G-E-152
    
142 EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENTS 
| 
athletes around him who are, as this student thinks, so much better 
than he. Thus he does not try himself out, and some excellent ma- 
terial is wasted. If he had been in a smaller college, he would have 
tried himself out, and would have developed into a runner worth 
while, and would have done both himself and his Alma Mater good. 
On the other hand, if a man is exceptionally bright, and good at his 
studies, if he is in a smaller college, he will have more opportunity 
for the individual attention of the instructors, than if he were in a 
large university, where, besides being distracted from his work by the 
multifarious interests of a large institution he is prevented from close 
contact with the professors who have to teach large classes and are 
hindered from much outside help of the students by the excessive 
burdens of administrative work. 
Before the Renaissance, artists and sculptors made their statues 
and pictures thin, and weak looking figures. They saw absolutely 
no beauty in the human body. At the time of the Renaissance, 
artists began to see beauty in muscular and strong bodies, and 
consequently many took warriors as subjects for their statues. 
Two of the statues that Michel Angelo, the great sculptor and artist, 
made, Perseus with the head of Medusa, and David with Goliath’s 
head, are very similar. They show minutely and with wonderful 
exactness every muscle of the body. Michel Angelo was a great 
student of the body, especially when it was in a strained position. 
The position of the figures on the tomb of Lorenzo the Great is so 
wonderful that one can almost see the tension of the muscles. 
When I awoke, all was dark except for a round, queer looking 
thing, directly above my head. It resembled a pale blue moon, 
far away in the hazy distance. At other times it looked like a 
shining silver dollar, right over my nose. I lay, musing on this 
thing, for a while, when, suddenly, like a clap of thunder, I real- 
ized that I was engulfed in snow, and the “round, queer looking 
thing ” was a little hole in the top of my small abode, through which 
my breath passed. I shot my fist upward, and after several blows 
in different parts of my roof, I succeeded in extricating myself. 
Bursting as I did from almost complete darkness into an atmos- 
phere of dazzling whiteness and light, blinded me. But I had no

it was freezingly cold, and I popped quickly back to my warm

A summer session should not be instituted in the High Schools 
of New York City because it would be physically and mentally 
detrimental to the pupil. It is self-evident that all human beings 
as well as animals require, if they would keep in health, a rest from 
the monotonous toil of the day. This is especially needed when 
the weather is so warm that one feels that he is carrying a burden 
by merely existing. To add to the burden of a mere existence, the 
tiresome labor in a poorly ventilated school-room in the close city, 
would certainly culminate in a nervous breakdown. Ten months 
of mental labor is as much a strain as any healthy person can with- 
stand. To do the school work properly, one also has to be in good 
physical condition, for as some one has said ‘“‘ a healthy mind rests 
within a healthy body.” The country air and freedom for at least 
two months is the best and only way to effect a healthy constitution.

Venus of Melos. 
In looking at this statue we think, not of wisdom, or power, or 
force, but just of beauty. She stands resting the weight of her 
body on one foot, and advancing the other (left) with knee bent. 
The posture causes the figure to sway slightly to one side, describ- 
ing a fine curved line. The lower limbs are draped but the upper 
part of the body is uncovered. (The unfortunate loss of the statue’s 
arms prevents a positive knowledge of its original attitude.) The 
eyes are partly closed, having something of a dreamy langour. The 
nose is perfectly cut, the mouth and chin are moulded in adorable 
curves. Yet to say that every feature is of faultless perfection is 
but cold praise. No analysis can convey the sense of her peerless 
beauty.

had just been going told on her. Her legs trembled, and her heart 
beat like a trip-hammer. She slowed her speed perforce, but still 
fled industriously up the right bank of the stream. When she had 
gone a couple of miles and the dogs were evidently gaining again, 
she crossed. the broad, deep brook, climbed the steep left bank, and 
fled on in the direction of the Mt. Marcy trail. The fording of the 
river threw the hounds off for a time; she knew by their uncertain 
yelping, up and down the opposite bank, that she had a little respite ; 
she used it, however, to push on until the baying was faint in her ears, 
and then she dropped exhausted upon the ground. 
I suppose none of us recognize the great part that is played in 
life by eating and drinking. The appetite is so imperious, that 
we can stomach the least interesting viands, and pass off a dinner 
hour thankfully enough on bread and water; just as there are men 
who must read something, if it were only Bradshaw’s Guide. But 
there is a romance about the matter after all. Probably the table 
has more devotees than love; and I am sure that food is much more 
generally entertaining than scenery. Do you give in, as Walt Whit- 
man would say, that you are any less immortal for that? The true 
materialism is to be ashamed of what we are. To detect the flavor 
of an olive is no less a piece of human perfection than to find beauty 
in the colours of the sunset.

A Foreigner’s Tribute to Joan of Arc. 
Joan of Arc, worn out by the suffering that was thrust upon her, 
nevertheless appeared with a brave mien before the Bishop of Beau- 
vais. She knew, had always known that she must die when her 
mission was fulfilled and death held no terrors for her. To all 
the bishop’s questions she answered firmly and without hesitation. 
The bishop failed to confuse her and at last condemned her to death 
for heresy, bidding her recant if she would live. She refused and was 
led to prison, from there to death. 
While the flames were writhing around her she bade the old bishop 
who stood by her to move away or he would be injured. Her last 
thought was of others and De Quincy says, that recant was no more

in her mind than on her lips. She died as she lived, with a prayer on 
her lips and listening to the voices that had whispered to her so often. 
The heroism of Joan of Arc was wonderful. We do not know what 
form her great patriotism took or how far it really led her. She 
spoke of hearing voices and of seeing visions. We only know that 
she resolved to save her country, knowing though she did so, it would 
cost her her life. Yet she never hesitated. She was uneducated 
save for the lessons taught her by nature. Yet she led armies and 
crowned the dauphin, king of France. She was only a girl, yet she 
could silence a great bishop by words that came from her heart and 
from her faith. She was only a woman, yet she could die as bravely 
as any martyr who had gone before.

If finally we ask what are the limitations of Aristotle, we find 
none save the limitations of the age and city in which he lived. 
He lived in a city-state where thirty thousand full male citizens, 
with some seventy thousand women and children dependent upon 
them, were supported by the labour of some hundred thousand 
slaves. The rights of man as such, whether native or alien, male 
or female, free or slave, had not yet been affirmed. That crown- 
ing proclamation of universal emancipation was reserved for Chris- 
tianity three centuries and a half later. Without this Christian 
element no principle of personality is complete. Not until the 
city-state of Plato and Aristotle is widened to include the humblest 
man, the lowliest woman, the most defenceless little child, does 
their doctrine become final and universal. Yet with this single 
limitation of its range, the form of Aristotle’s teaching is complete 
and ultimate. Deeper, saner, stronger, wiser statement of the 
principles of personality the world has never heard.

HARVARD-NEWTON SCALES 
The Harvard-Newton scales are composed of four scales, one for 
each of the four types of composition: narration, description, argu- 
mentation, and exposition. Each scale is composed of six steps 
with one sample for each step. These scales were. derived by ob- 
taining a large number of compositions written by pupils in the 
eighth grade. These compositions were marked by the percentile 
method by twenty-four teachers. The value assigned to each sam- 
ple is the consensus of the marks thus obtained which range in value 
from approximately 45% to 95%. In rating compositions, these 
scales are used in the same manner as the Hillegas-Thorndike scale. 
The chief advantage of the Hillegas-Thorndike scale is that the 
samples are scaled more accurately and more scientifically than those 
of the Harvard-Newton scales. The advantage of the latter is the 
fact of having a separate series of samples for each type of composition. 
Neither of the scales has been used on a sufficiently extensive basis 
to demonstrate their value, but the probability is that, with prac- 
tice in using them, the evaluation of composition work can be made 
more accurately and more objectively. A test made with twenty- 
four compositions written by sixth and seventh grade pupils on the 
subject ‘“ Roads” showed that the mean variation of the ratings 
made by twenty-four teachers by the ordinary percentile method was 
7.8 and the mean variation of the ratings made by the Harvard-New- 
ton scales was 6.6. Both mean variations are expressed in terms of 
units of the Harvard-Newton scales. The difference is small, but it 
is in favor of greater uniformity of evaluation by the scale. The 
advantage would probably increase with the use of the scale. None 
of the teachers had ever used the scales before.

A STORM IN A FISHING VILLAGE 
It was a cold damp day in November. The sky was a heavy leaden color. 
In the east a black line stretched across it foretelling the coming of a storm. 
The houses across the way were dismal shadows — flat, cold, heartless. A pierc- 
ing chill penetrated to the bone. The rattle of a grocer’s cart or the clatter of a 
horse’s hoofs, seemed cold. The pedestrians were all clothed in black, or else
-P-A-G-E-157
  
THE MEASUREMENT OF ABILITY IN ENGLISH COMPOSITION 147 
the feeble light made them seem so, and they were cold — everything was cold, 
cold, cold. An awful lonliness pervaded all. 
The black line in the east had grown into a cloud and was coming nearer, 
nearer, over the sea. Suddenly a gust of wind shook the very foundations of 
the houses, — another, and then a continuous blowing. The howling was hor- 
tible. Great sheets of foam were blown into the streets, — here and there a 
piece of wreckage hurled itself against a cottage. Fishermen’s wives hurried 
down the narrow streets to the shore, straining their eyes for any sign of a wreck. 
Old seamen looked at the roaring sea and shook their heads. 
By this time the black cloud engulfed the sky. The day was like night, 
although it was not yet noon. Boys ran about with torches which were imme- 
diately extinguished, and the roaring called to mind the last day of Pompeii. 
Rain had begun to descend. At first only drops fell on the hardened faces 
of old mariners, and on the pale countenances of wives, mingling with the drops 
already there. But soon great sheets fell, forcing the people indoors, to the poor 
shelter afforded by the groaning houses. 
For about an hour the storm continued thus, then by degrees the wind les- 
sened, though the rain still fell, and the ocean thundered. But soon the rain 
also slowly stopped and the roaring ceased. The black cloud rolled slowly away, 
leaving the tardy sun to shine on the drenched town and the great piles of wreck- 
age on the shore. 
MERITS: This theme ranks high because the writer has a clear picture of 
the scene and has used words and phrases that bring the details of this picture 
clearly before the reader: There are good color images in such expressions as 
“leaden,” ‘‘a black line,” “great sheets of foam,’’ ‘‘the day was like night,”’ and 
“the sun shining on the drenched town.” Sound effects are strikingly brought 
out by such phrases as “‘the rattle of a grocer’s cart,”’ ‘‘the howling,” “the wreck- 
age hurled against the cottage,” “the roaring sea,’ and ‘‘the thundering ocean.” 
The sensation of dreariness and chill is conveyed by the repetition of the word 
cold. The confusion caused by the storm is reflected in the anxious look of the 
wives of the fishermen. A further human touch is added in the mention of such 
details as ‘“‘the extinguished torches carried by the boys” and ‘‘the drops of rain 
falling upon the hardened faces of the old mariners.’ All these enumerations 
fittingly combine to produce a tone of coldness, desolation, and anxiety. The 
details are told in their natural sequences. This chronological arrangement 
has helped the writer to keep safely to his main point and effectively connect 
the details with each other. 
DEFECTS: the repetition of the word ‘‘cold,” while effective in bringing 
out the sensation, is somewhat artificial. ‘‘Loneliness”’ is misspelled; a semi- 
colon should supplant the first comma in line 6. Omit the comma in line 5. 
COMPARISON: The theme is superior to No. 2 in its richness of imagery, 
its wealth of details, its depth of feeling, its maturity of style (seen in the sen- 
tence-structure and the vocabulary), and its mastery of mechanical forms.

GRANDMOTHER 
In the front of the open fireplace in a large armchair there sits our old Granny. 
She is old and feeble. Her hair is snow-white and over her head a little white 
cap is carefully tied. Her face is full of wrinkles and her keen blue eyes sparkle 
through a pair of glasses which she has on her nose. 
She has a shawl thrown over her shoulders and she also wears a thick black 
skirt. On her feet can be seen a pair of soft slippers which she prizes very much 
because they were given her for a Christmas present. 
As you know Grannies always like to be busy, our Granny is busy knitting

is done. Now that it is done she carefully folds her work and packs it into her 
work-basket. Then she trots upstairs to bed, and oh, how lonesome it is when our 
dear Granny is gone from the room. 
MERITS: The merits of this composition are: (1) the clear and pleasing 
impression obtained; (2) the happy choice of details and the logical sequence 
of their arrangement; (3) the sympathetic treatment of the subject — for 
example, bits of sentiment seen in the grandmother’s attachment to the slippers, 
and the loneliness felt when she goes to her room; (4) the interesting introductory 
sentence; and (5) the mechanical accuracy. 
DEFECTS: The defects are: (1) the rather monotonous sentence structure, 
and (2) the childish vocabulary. 
COMPARISON: To justify its place in the scale note: (1) that in No. 1 
there is successfully treated a much more difficult subject; (2) there is a greater 
power of imagination; and (3) there is a greater variety of sentence structure and 
a richer vocabulary.

A MANSION 
As you look across the road you will first see a long private avenue or walk. 
It is in the summer, and on each side of this long walk are some beautiful, 
stately elms. They are hundreds of years old and they have done their duty for 
as many years, shading the walk from the noon sun. 
Cross the road and you will see if you look up the avenue, a beautiful mansion. 
It is a colonial house and four large pillars are upholding the roof. A piazza 
runs along three sides of the house. 
Near the house is a tennis court where for years the occupants of the mansion 
have passed many an hour. 
Let us enter the mansion. It is a beautiful cool place, although dark. As 
we enter we see large psalms on each side of the entrance. On the floors are old 
oriental rugs which have been handed down for generations. In the parlor is 
a harp, and on the walls are the portraits of the ancestors. In all, it is a beauti- 
ful place. 
MERITS: The writer of this theme has presented a clear though conven- 
tional picture. Although he changes his point of view several times, he has 
attempted to put his readers into the best positions to see the mansion, The 
choice of words is fair. Such details as the stately elms, the oriental rugs, the 
Per, and the portraits are well selected. Only one mistake in spelling occurs

DEFECTS: There are, however, too many paragraphs for such a short 
theme. Constant repetition of the pronoun ‘‘you’’ and of the words ‘“‘beautiful”’ 
and “mansion” give an impression of monotony and of limited vocabulary. 
The pupil has evidently a definite place in mind, but has not suggested the spirit 
of the scene, as has the writer of No. 2. 
COMPARISON: The composition deserves its place in the scale above No. 
4 because of better sentence structure and more orderly arrangement. It is 
inferior to No. 2 on account of its somewhat prosaic tone and its constantly chang- 
ing point of view.

and see the sun peering up over the top of the mountains and shinning on the 
water. Then a King Fisher flies down the lake making his cheerful noise, in- 
stantly, all the other birds begin to chirp as if their life depended on it. 
Looking across the lake one would see numerous wells and coves backed up by 
woods from which comes the chirp of the birds. Hearing the explosions of cylin- 
ders we look to see where in comes from and find a pumphouse that keeps the 
lake supplied with water. 
Looking down the lake over the dam to the ice house with the roof sparkling 
with. On the roof of the house a hawk is sitting adding his clear whistle to noise 
of other birds. 
Looking around to the woods, at our back, with an old oil well in front of them. 
The birds flying from the woods in flocks, and far away from the hills comes the 
sound of the of Italians singing. 
MERITS: The writer has seen and heard concrete details and has recreated 
his images clearly. He has tried, too, to make his point of view obvious to the 
reader. His vocabulary is adequate. 
DEFECTS: As a description the composition fails because there is no unified 
picture of the lake. The selected details, clear in themselves, tend to distract 
rather than center the interest. There are numerous mechanical errors: there 
should be no commas after ‘‘lake” or ‘‘sunrise” (line 3); “‘shining” (line 4) is 
misspelled; there should be a period after ‘“‘noise” (line 5) and no comma after 
“instantly” (line 6), which should commence with a capital; in (line 9) “in” 
is not correct; the groups of words in (lines 11, 12) and (lines 14, 15) do not make 
sentences; the word “‘the”’ is omitted before noise (line 12) and the word “are” 
before “flying” (line 15). 
COMPARISON: The theme merits its rank in the scale by superiority in 
spelling, paragraphing, and maturity of thought. It does not, on the other hand, 
show equal mastery in the fine details, the discriminating vocabulary, and in 
the ability to stick to the point. The sentence-sense is faulty.

A LIGHT HOUSE 
A description of a light house is quite interesting. 
First a light house is generally situated on a mass of rocks in the ocean or on 
some great lake. And then to get into a light house is a question. Some times 
you have to climb to the top on a steal ladder, and again you only have to go half 
way up and you find sort of a steal porch which is very strong with a door in the 
side of the light house. On the very top of the light there is generally two or 
three life boats in case of accidents. In side there is an enormous light which 
flashes every two minutes and sometimes more often it depends holy on the 
weather. The man himself has very favorable sleeping quarter and food it is a 
very lonely life except when you have a man with you. Sometimes they play 
cards all day long until it is time to fix the lights and then they are very busy. 
MERITS: The merits of this theme are: (1) the evident spirit of faithful 
accuracy; and (2) a successful use of certain simple words, — such as “mass of 
rocks,” ‘enormous light” and ‘‘lonely life.” 
DEFECTS: Many obvious defects warrant its low position in the scale. 
The pupil was asked to write a description. After announcing his purpose to 
do this, he writes an exposition, or explanation of light houses in general. The 
first sentence of the theme is worthless, contributing nothing toward the devel- 
opment of the subject. It should be omitted. The paragraph is full of mis- 
spelled words and grammatical slips: ‘‘steel,”’ “inside,” “wholly,” “‘sometimes,”’ 
“sleeping quarter.”” The most striking weakness of the words is the loose and 
rambling form of the sentences, indicating indefinite thought. ‘‘Run-on” sen-

tences are found in lines 8-11. No attempt has been made to establish a point 
of view. On this account, and because of a lack of vivid words, the passage is 
dead and colorless. 
COMPARISON: The composition is placed above No. 6 because it contains 
fewer mechanical errors.

A SCENE ON THE PRAIRIES 
Along a large plain in the west with mountains on all sides. The sun was just 
sinking behind the mountains. Some trappers were on the plain just about to 
get their supper. They had one tend because there was just three of them. Be- 
side their tent tripled a little spring. After the three trappers had eating their 
supper they sat down by the fire because it had growing dark. Allof asuddena 
bunch of Indian’s came riding up. When they came near they fired off their 
guns and disappeared in the darkness and the trappers turned into camp leaving 
one of the trappers on guard. 
MERITS: The commendable features of this composition are directness, 
simplicity, and a logical arrangement of details. The writer passes from the 
general to the specific in a natural manner. In spite of a change in the point of 
view in the last two sentences, the paragraph, as a whole, makes a clear picture. 
DEFECTS: Blunders in grammar and in spelling, lack of sentence-sense, 
and short, childish sentences make the rating of the composition necessarily 
very low. Such errors as ‘‘tend”’ for ‘‘tent,” “tripled” for ‘‘trickled,” ‘‘eating”’ 
for ‘‘eaten,” ‘“‘growing”’ for ‘‘grown,” and the misspelling of ‘‘Indians” indicate 
either hasty, careless work, or slovenly habits of enunciation. 
COMPARISON: Compared with the descriptions of the storm and of grand- 
mother, the short sentences here show immaturity and weakness rather than 
skill or force. With a large amount of correcting of mechanical details, but 
with very little revising as a whole, this paragraph would be superior to No. 5.

EXPLANATION OF STANDARD TIME 
Standard Time is used in the United States to avoid great differences in time 
between cities. In travelling from our eastern to our western coast one would 
find on arriving that his watch was three hours too fast. The cause for this is 
that the sun’s rays strike the Atlantic coast three hours sooner than they do the 
Pacific coast. 
Formerly each city had its own sun time or Local Time, which was a great 
inconvenience to travellers and more so when railroads were established. 
This trouble has been wholly avoided by dividing our country into time 
belts. There are five consecutive belts which bear names that refer to the land 
which they cover. 
The belt which is farthest east is called the Colonial Time belt. The belt 
which includes New England and New York is named the Eastern Time belt 
while the belt that passes through the midst of our country is named the Central 
Time belt. The remaining two are the Mountain and Pacific Time belts; the 
Mountain Time belt is centered around the Rocky Mountains while the Pacific 
Time belt includes our western coast. 
There are three hundred and sixty degrees which the sun has to cover in one

day or twenty-four hours, therefore the sun overspreads fifteen degrees in one 
hour; for that reason the distance between each belt is fifteen degrees. 
The Eastern Time belt starts on the 15th meridian, the Central on the goth 
meridian, the Mountain Time belt commences on the 1o5th meridian while the 
Pacific Time belt begins on the 120th meridian. Now when one goes from our 
eastern to our western coast he has to set his watch back one hour at every fif- 
teenth meridian. 
MERITS: The merits of this theme are: (1) an orderly and well-arranged 
presentation of facts; (2) a mature use of connective words and easy transitions 
between paragraphs; (3) a marked variety of sentence structure; (4) a careful 
choice of words to avoid repetition; (5) an almost complete absence of serious 
mechanical errors. 
DEFECTS: There should be two or three paragraphs instead of six. There 
are one or two obvious misstatements of facts. In the last paragraph a semi- 
colon should stand after twenty-four hours. 
COMPARISON: This composition is superior to No. 2 in its greater maturity 
and variety of expression, and in its efficient handling of a more difficult subject.

HOW TO MAKE FUDGE 
A very common and well liked home made candy is Fudge. It is very easily 
and quickly made. 
To make it, put two cup-fulls of sugar, four teaspoonfuls of cocoa, a piece of 
butter about the size of a walnut, and three-fourths of a cup of milk into a small 
kettle. 
Place this on the stove to boil until, when a small amount of it is dropped in 
a glass of cold water it will form a ball. Stir it while boiling. 
As soon as it will form a ball in water take it from the stove and add two tea- 
spoonfulls of vanilla. A cupful of ground English walnuts or cocoanut may be 
added, also, if desired. 
Then pour it into well buttered tins and let cool before cutting it into pieces. 
Cut the pieces about an inch square. 
If these rules are followed accurately the candy will harden and be very good. 
MERITS: “The writer of this theme evidently knows how to make fudge 
and has stated the method simply and clearly. The words are well chosen and 
the sentence structure good. Evidence of a plan is shown in the introduction 
and conclusion, as also in the logical arrangement of details.” 
DEFECTS: The words cupfuls and teaspoonfuls are misspelled; there is a 
shifting of mood from indicative to imperative; the theme should be in one 
paragraph. 
COMPARISON: This theme is not so good as No. 1 because of its poor 
sentence structure and lack of excellence of style. It is better than No. 3, be- 
cause it is a clearer exposition.

of which you use them the first one being nearest the plate. The forks are at 
the left of the plate in the same order as the spoons. The glasses are at the right 
above the knife. The napkins are at the left beside the forks. The maid serves 
the person left of the hostess first. 
When the dinner is ready the guests assemble, but before entering the dining- 
room the men draw from a box or hat, which contains the names of the ladies 
present, one of the names, the one he draws he escorts into dinner he seats her 
first then sits at her left. 
MERITS: This theme, with the exception of one or two sentences, is ar- 
ranged in an orderly fashion, and leaves a clear impression on the reader’s mind. 
There is a fair knowledge of paragraph structure. The spelling is accurate. 
DEFECTS: There are, however, numerous faults. Only the third para- 
graph pertains to the title of the composition: the first and second tell how to 
prepare for a dinner party. There is room for improvement in paragraph struc- 
ture: paragraphs one and two should be combined. The use of short sentences 
is monotonous. There are two ‘‘run-on”’ sentences in the last paragraph. The 
repetition of the words decide upon is unpleasant. The use of pronouns is lax: 
you is used for one in lines 1 and 8; and one is used ambiguously in line 16. 
COMPARISON: The theme is ranked higher than No. 4 because it is more 
coherent and the sentence structure is better. Because the sentence structure 
is more monotonous, and because it is not so well punctuated, the theme is placed 
lower than No. 2.

HOW TO BUILD A FIRE 
To build a furnace fire you must as the following instructs. First, you must 
rake down and take out all the cinders, clinkers and ashes, sift them, so as to do 
away with clinkers and ashes and use cinders for some other purpose. 
The next step, is to get your material ready to work with. First you put 
some paper in the furnace, on that some wood, wait until the wood is blazing, 
then take three good-sized shovels full of small coal and put it on that. Take 
the same amount of big coal repeating the same process. A fire like this is sup- 
posed to last eight hours. The next thing to do is to open all your drafts to let 
the air in and all the gas and smoke out so as the fire will progress quicker. Last 
of all investigate your work to see if it is allright. Your task is done. 
MERITS: This theme shows clear thinking and a mastery of the details that 
make the whole convincing. The writer has evidently built furnace fires and 
relives the process as he writes. His vocabulary is thoroughly suited to his theme. 
DEFECTS: The writer has shown no care in revising his theme. There 
is an obvious omission in the first line, careless sentence structure in the second 
paragraph, and a misspelling of all right in the last line. The sentence com- 
mencing “A fire like this” is an intrusion — an offense against coherence. The 
last sentence may be omitted. 
COMPARISON: This theme is thinner in subject-matter than No. 3 and is 
more obviously lacking in a sense of style and form. A firm grasp of the ele- 
mentary principles of composition secures its place above No. 5.

that goes around his neck and then take hold of the bit in the other hand. 
You then take hold of the lower part of his mouth and pull it down and then slip the bit in his mouth. The bit is the iron piece on the bridal. When you get the 
bit in his mouth you tie the strap around his neck. Then take the collar and put 
it over his head on to his neck. The last thing to do is to put the saddle on, 
throw the saddle over back and buckle the inside strap on the to the other side, of the saddle, you put it under his stomack to buckle it and you have to have it good and tight. 
MERITS: The merits are three in number: (1) the writer knew how to har- 
ness a horse; (2) he has given his directions in an orderly manner; (3) he has kept 
to his subject — has omitted all unnecessary details. 
DEFECTS: The defects are as follows: (1) the ideas are crudely and awk- 
wardly expressed; (2) the vocabulary is meager, as shown for example, by the 
frequent repetition of bridle and saddle; (3) bridle and stomach are misspelled; 
and (4) the last sentence is ungrammatical' and crude — it should be recast. 
COMPARISON: This theme precedes No. 6 in the scale, because it is supe- 
rior in sentence structure, spelling, and clearness. It is inferior to No. 4 in vocab-

up put them into the socets on the saddle them tient up the shaft strap then fix 
the traces to the whippel tree the the bretchen then the chect rains the run the 
tains throught the holds in the saddle back to the team. 
MERITS: Only two things can be said in commendation of this theme: 
the first sentence is free from mechanical errors, and the directions for harness- 
ing a horse are given in logical order. 
DEFECTS: The theme has many faults. The meagerness of the writer's 
vocabulary, made conspicuous by the childish repetition of then and put; his 
utter lack of sentence sense; his inexcusable errors in spelling, such as “led” for 
“lead,” the for then, left for lift, tient for tighten — all these illiteracies make 
the theme rank low. 
COMPARISON: This theme is inferior to No. 5 in spelling, punctuation, 
and sentence structure. With its bare enumeration of the steps in the process 
of harnessing a horse, it completely lacks the slight elements of grace which de- 
pendent clauses and fuller explanations contribute to No. 5.

IS A YEAR OF TRAVEL MORE ADVANTAGEOUS THAN A YEAR OF 
STUDY 
Yes. In nearly all lines of study, travel is an important aid. 
Geography for instance. Places dryly discussed in class and soon forgotten 
become actual. Races that made no impression in print are fastened in the mind 
by a hundred vivid pictures. Products that seemed so useless and annoying to 
learn are full of importance and interest when seen being loaded on ships or mules. 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
  154 EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENTS 
Queer oriental customs, laughed at when studied become natural, comprehended 
facts. Statistics are seldom learned while travelling, but when they are, they 
are remembered because the bare, dry fact is connected with an actual thing 
— not merely figures, groaned over because they were difficult to learn. 
History also. Some spot where General A’s army manceuvered in this direc- 
tion, and Colonel B’s in that, becomes real ground, to be reverenced and remem- 
bered. The hills that would get on the wrong side of the diagram are here in their 
true position, and that granite monument marks the spot where the brave com- 
manders died. 
Languages, too. An impossible French name slides off glibly when often heard. 
Some word is gained with very little effort, another, and the door to the whole 
language is thrown wide. The same is true of Italian, and the best part of it is 
that the pronunciation is correct. 
Mathematics could not be so easily acquired, it is true, as in the schoolroom. 
But when the mind has been broadened by the year of travel, the student would | 
more easily learn this branch. 
As for English, a year like this would be the greatest advantage possible. The 
landscapes of Switzerland or Italy, the odd manners of the Orientals, the thousand 
types of humanity — everything lends its aid. 
On the whole, travel is a thousand times an improvement over the school, 
because it creates interest, stimulates thought, and broadens the traveller as 
nothing else can. 
MERITS: This theme is excellent because the writer has his argument clearly 
in mind, follows a carefully planned outline, and expresses himself convincingly. 
The question is stated clearly, and the conclusion leaves a definite impression on 
the reader's mind. The illustrations used are well chosen and vivid, especially 
the ones about foreign customs and historical scenes. Vocabulary and sentence 
form are good. 
DEFECTS: A different arrangement of arguments in the order of climax 
would add strength to the theme. The beginning of each paragraph is awkward 
because of the use of detached phrases and words: i. e., yes; geography for in- 
stance, languages too. Either these phrases should be deliberately isolated as 
headings, and the whole paper thrown into outline form, or else they should be 
expanded into complete statements. There is some weakness in punctuation, 
as for example, a semicolon should be substituted for the comma after effort in 
line 22.

definite plan; its arguments are more clearly stated, and its vocabulary is more 
varied.

WHY COUNTRY LIFE IS BETTER THAN CITY LIFE 
Country life is the best kind of life there is to be lived. 
The country is good for children and grown up people alike. The children 
have plenty of fresh air and room to run about in. To be sure they do not have 
the large schools of the city; but they have the great school of Nature and that 
is greater than any learning they could get in city schools. The parents are not 
afraid to let them run about because there are no automobiles, electric cars, etc., 
to run over them. There is safety in the country. 
The country is the best place sick people could go. The air is pure and brac- 
ing and there is water cool and fresh from the spring or well. For the tired man 
working in a busy city office a rest in the country is the best thing for him and the 
sooner he gets it the better it is for him. 
The country people have good times even if they don’t go to fancy balls, 
theatres, etc., and stay up until one or two o’clock in the morning. They havea 
good healthy time and are home and in bed by nine or half-past.
-P-A-G-E-165
THE MEASUREMENT OF ABILITY IN ENGLISH COMPOSITION I55 
For these reasons, and many others, the country is the best place for children 
or adults, sick or well. 
MERITS: The writer has a sense of arrangement, shown (1) by his intro- 
duction; (2) by his paragraphs that develop successively the advantages of 
country life; and (3) by his conclusion. The composition is also correct in its 
elementary mechanics — spelling, punctuation, grammar, and paragraph and 
sentence structure. The vocabulary, while not distinctive, is adequate. 
DEFECTS: The arguments are not wholly convincing. For example, the 
great school of Nature is, for most children, not a satisfactory substitute for a 
city school. Then, to say without qualification, that the country is the best place 
for sick people to. go, is misleading. The repeated use of etc., is ineffective. 
The summary should not contain the phrase ‘‘and many others.” 
COMPARISON: This composition lacks the virility of thought and diction 
that marks No. 1. It is, however, superior to No. 3 in arrangement, in sentence 
structure, and in its firmness of mental grasp.

THE GOOD OF A LANTERN IN GEOGRAPHY 
A lantern is a good thing in a school as it shows the different cities, countries, 
and also the ways of the people. This gets the children acquainted with foreign 
places. Also the reciting about the pictures gives them an interest which would 
not be so great as if they were in the schoolroom. 
It is a good thing for the children to get up before the class and recite, that 
gives them self-confidence and also prepares them more for high school. In 
having the lantern it interests the childten so they look for pictures to use, and 
they find and read many interesting things. 
When the pictures are passed out they look up many things at home and find 
out new things and so as other children find things out they help the class. 
MERITS: The merits of this composition are three: (1) the form is purely 
argumentative throughout; (2) the pupil had a few distinct advantages of the 
use of a lantern in mind; and (3) troublesome words like acquaintance and for- 
eign are correctly spelled. 
DEFECTS: The defects are as follows: (1) poor arrangement of facts makes 
this theme ineffective; (2) the sentences are awkward — for example the third 
and fifth; (3) the fourth sentence illustrates the ‘‘run-on”’ sentence or “‘comma 
error”; (4) there is lack of clearness in the antecedents of pronouns — ‘‘ they” in 
lines 4, 9, and 10; (5) there is a poverty of vocabulary — the word “thing” or 
“‘things”’ occurs six times, and “‘ children” occurs in almost every sentence. 
COMPARISON: This theme follows No. 2 in the scale because it has less 
mature thought, inferior sentence structure, and a more limited and childish 
vocabulary. It precedes No. 4 because, although not so effectively written, it 
adheres more closely to the form of writing required — argumentation.

FOOTBALL IS A BETTER GAME THAN BASEBALL 
Football is.a better game than baseball. It’s not only (only) muscle and 
strength that makes a football player. He must have the power to think quick. 
When the team is a short distance from the goal and scores, somebody’s quick 
thinking has done it. 
Baseball is an exciting game in parts. But football is exciting from the (the) 
time the ball is kicked till the referee blows his whistle. Football shows when a 
man or boy has grit. I once attended a game. The score was tie and the op-

posing team were only a few yards from the goal and three minutes to play. The 
quarterback gave his signal and they struck the line. The struggling mass moved 
a few feet and stopped with a jump. .Out of the massa man jumped. His face 
was all battered, but he struggled on till he had got the ball over the line. Some 
people call it brutal. Some cases it is and some it is not. I would rather strike 
the line in football clothes for a few yards gain, than stand up at a plate anda 
man hurl baseballs at me. Which would you rather do? 
MERITS: The writer of this theme evidently has a plan of procedure in 
mind. After clearly stating his proposition in the first sentence, he seeks to es- 
tablish three good points of superiority for the game of football. Though unable 
to prove these points, he has succeeded in leaving with the reader a firm convic- 
tion of his belief that football is a good sport. Lines 7-13 give effectively the 
writer’s impressions of a critical moment in a game. 
DEFECTS: The author fails to prove his proposition, because he mistakes 
for arguments a few loosely stated facts and preferences. His plan of reasoning, 
though suggested, is entirely undeveloped. Mechanical errors are numerous: 
(1) two mistakes in the use of parentheses (lines 1 and 5); (2) plural verb with 
singular subject (line 8); (3) adjective modifies a verb (line 2); and the pro- 
noun “‘it”’ is used vaguely in line 12. The paragraphs are without system, and 
the sentences in general are short and disconnected.

WHY EVERY GIRL SHOULD LEARN TO COOK 
Every girl should learn to cook. If she was out of imploiment it would be 
very useful. . 
Later on, if she should keep house she would want to be able to cook. If she 
didn’t know how, the lady would have to hire a cook. Sometime, perhaps, she 
could not pay to keep a cook. Then she would say, ‘‘Oh, how I wished I learned. 
to cook when I was younger, instead of buying bakers things.” 
If this womans children wanted to learn to cook who would they ask to learn 
them. Their mother couldn’t, because she didn’t know how her self. So you 
may see for yourself it is very important that every girl should learn to cook. 
MERITS: This theme shows that the author had a plan; for it gives several 
sound reasons why every girl should learn to cook — reasons arranged in a fairly 
logical order. The punctuation of certain sentences is unexpectedly good. 
DEFECTS: The theme is, however, faulty in unity and coherence. There 
is a shifting of tense, a lack of definite antecedents for such words as “‘it”’ (line 1), 
and “lady” (line 4). The arguments are not sufficiently expanded to make them 
clear. The theme is further marred by such mechanical errors as: misspelling 
of employment (line 1); a complete absence of the apostrophe and interrogation 
point; the incorrect use of “‘who”’ (line 7), and “learn”’ (line 7).

less force as an argument, and has more mechanical errors.

celery, digging potatoes, pulling turnips, picking apples, pears, cutting onions 
and every thing else. So the winter is the only time you can have fun when they 
are nothing to do. 
MERITS: There is little to defend in this theme. Only one line of argument, 
is attempted; that one, however, is arranged logically according to the order of 
the four seasons. The use of specific words is good, and the large number of il- 
hema ope drawn from the pupil’s own experience arouses sympathy in the 
reader. 
DEFECTS: Although the range of arguments is limited, and those argu- 
ments consist mainly of the enumeration of the woes that beset a boy in the 
other seasons rather than in the joys of winter, it is from the mechanical stand- 
point that this theme is a failure. There is manifested an entire lack of sen- 
tence-sense since examples of both “‘run-on”’ sentences and unfinished clauses 
occur frequently. Errors in spelling, punctuation, and grammar are found in 
every line. The whole composition is the expression of a backward, limited mind. 
COMPARISON: The theme deserves a lower place in the scale than No. 5 
because of the greater frequency of mechanical errors. In weight of subject 
matter, however, it is superior.

MY FIRST RIDING LESSON1 
I gazed down into the riding ring from the balcony where I was sitting. The 
riding master was cantering around the ring with a young girl who seemed to 
be an experienced rider. Riding looked easy. 
After another round he rode up to the doors which a man outside flung open, 
and rode out. A few minutes later he called up the stairs, ‘‘I am ready for you, 
Miss Speare,” and taking my crop I rushed eagerly down the stairs, for this was 
my first riding lesson. a 
I scrambled on to the back of a small horse that stood patiently quiet, waiting. 
“Are your stirrups all right ?” the riding master asked, when I was on. 
“Yes,”’ I replied. ‘‘ They are just the right length.” 
“Thats good,’’ and he leaped into the saddle and we rode irto the ring. 
“You have not ridden before, have you?" he asked as we walked slowly around 
the ring. 
“No,” I replied, ‘‘I haven’t.” ‘But I was thinking to myself how easy riding 
is! 
“We will trot now,” he said, after a little and the horses began to trot slowly. 
Then I discovered my mistake. Riding is not especially easy for beginers. 
And trotting is not as easy as walking. 
“Rise with the horse,” he commanded. ‘‘Cling on with your knees and rise 
in your stirrups.” 
Easier said then done. I bounced up and down until I thought I should fall 
off. It looked so easy when other people trotted! He seemed to do it so easily, 
why couldn’t 1? Yet I couldn’t and that was plain.

I staggered up the stairs, for I was very wobbly, seized my crop and hurried 
down. If riding was like this all the time! He was talking to mother. 
“All right,” I heard him say, ‘‘A week from to-day; same time. She did 
pretty well for the first time. Too bad she is so stiff.’” 
I didn’t feel like another lesson at any time but I didn’t say so and with mother 
I left the riding school and my first riding lesson was at an end. 
MERITS: The situation is vividly portrayed, with plenty of conversation. 
From the lively introduction to the direct conclusion, the interest is kept up by 
well-selected details. The paragraphing is good, and the mastery of quotation 
marks is evident. Good choice of words is shown in such natural phrasing as 
“rushed,” ‘“‘gazed,’”’ “flung,” “scramble,” “bounced,” “staggered.” The con- 
nection between the paragraphs is unusually good. 
DEFECTS: The defects are in matters of form. There is unnecessary 
repetition of the word ride. Punctuation is omitted in several places. There 
are mistakes in spelling (lines 8, 17, 21). In that’s good, the apostrophe is 
omitted. The concluding sentence is loosely constructed. 
COMPARISON: This theme holds a higher place than No. 2 because of its 
excellent choice of details and its vivid expression. It is a more ambitious piece 
of work, and the interest is more surely sustained.

MY TRIP TO FAIRYLAND 
It was about four o’clock in the afternoon, and as I was very tired I sat down 
by the fire to rest. Suddenly I heard a small voice calling me by name. I imme- 
diately looked up and beside me I saw what I thought was a fairy. I was very 
much excited as I had never seen a fairy but had only read of them. 
“Would you like to come with me to Fairyland and rid yourself of your cares 
for a while?” she questioned. 
“T would love to,’”’ I answered. 
“Then only follow me,” she said. 
So out of the room we went and down the cellar stairs. 
“Where are you leading me?”’ I asked. 
“You shall soon find out,” she answered. 
We went into the darkest corner of the cellar. She showed me a small trap 
door which she went though, leaving me alone. 
“But how am I to get through?” I asked. 
Without a reply she touched me with her small wand, and before I had a 
chance to say a word I found myself through the door and in a beautiful garden 
which was filled with fragrant flowers of many kinds. She led me through it, 
and at one end of it I saw a white marble palace. 
“This is my home,” she said. Do you care to enter?” 
“That would be delightful,”’ I said. 
Up the stairs we went and down a long hall. Finally we came upon a large 
and beautiful room. It was filled with dancing fairies who were having a gay 
time. My fairy introduced me to some of the fairies, and then joined in the merry 
making. I stood and looked at the splendor of it all, when suddenly I heard a 
voice calling me, and I looked up. 
It was my mother who said, ‘I have called fou three times. You must have 
been asleep.”

MERITS: The spelling, punctuation, sentence structure, and especially 
the paragraphing of this composition, are accurate. The story, as a whole, 
has action; the conversation is well handled; there is a studious effort to avoid 
repetitions, as questioned, asked, answered, said (lines 6-8). 
DEFECTS: The chief defect is a childish use of tiresome short sentences. 
The verb forms do not produce action enough. In line 19 quotations marks are 
omitted before Do, and there should be a hyphen in merry-making (line 23). 
COMPARISON: The superior paragraph structure of this theme is sufficient 
to place it above No. 3. It lacks the merit seen in the easy and spirited conver- 
sation of No. 1.

LOST IN THE WOODS OF CONNECTICUT 
“Who's going blackberrying to-day?’’ cried my cousin Margaret waving her 
ail. 
iH “Tam,” I said coming out of the house a pail in one hand and a wide brimmed 
hat in the other. 
“ Allright,” answered Margaret, ‘‘but where’s Julia?’’ 
“Must be in the house,”’ I replied. 
We soon found her diligently reading a book and after some urging she decided 
to go. 
It was about eight o’clock when we started for if we waited till later on in the 
day it would be to hot. 
We walked a long ways to the other end of the farm after climbing stonewall 
and having several encounters with snakes. 
“How much farther do we have to go?’ I cried growing impatient. 
“The other side of this fiéld,”” Margaret called back. 
After climbing the stonewall we came in sight of big stretches of blackberries. 
We fell to work right away and picked very fast. 
In a little while we stopped and found we had worked a good ways. As we 
went on the berries seemed to grow bigger and sweeter. 
After filling my pail I found Margaret was through long before me and was 
sitting in their midst eating. We waited till Julia was through and then started 
for home. We were so busy talking Margaret didn’t notice which path we took 
and after walking a longs ways she discovered our mistake. I wanted to turn 
back and go the way we came but she said it would take to long so we struck out 
into the woods. The farther we went the more perplexed wé were till finally 
Margaret sat down under a tree in despair. 
This would never do so I decided to climb a nearby tree to see if we could see 
any signs of a house. 
‘With much pulling and tugging I got up the tree and saw a house to the right. 
We reached the house tired and hungry. 
We were lucky to come to come to such a place for the mistress proved to be 
very good. After resting one of the hired men drove us home just in time to see 
a searching party going out to look for us as it was now late in the afternoon. 
MERITS:. The most commendable feature of this narrative is the manage- 
ment of the conversation. This is accurately punctuated and contains a variety 
in the verbs of saying. Placed at the beginning, it gives an element of spontaneity 
and arouses the immediate interest of the reader. There are several well-chosen. 
expressions — such as ‘several encounters with snakes,” “pulling and tugging,” 
and “in despair.” The arrangement of ideas is logical. 
DEFECTS: Except for the incompatibility between the content and the 
title, the defects are mechanical: (1) poor paragraphing except in the conver- 
sation; (2) the unskillful use of the compound sentence in the sentences begin-  
-P-A-G-E-170
160 EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENTS 
ning on lines 7, 9, 21; (3) the unemphatic position of the participial phrase in 
lines 12 and 13, and of the dependent clause in the last sentence; (4) the absence 
of commas after introductory clauses and phrases, in some instances causing an 
ambiguity of meaning as in sentences commencing in lines 17 and 31; (5) the 
grammatical error in the incoherent reference of the pronoun their in line 20; 
(6) the evident carelessness in the spelling of ‘‘the,” “‘all right” and “too” and in 
the repetition of “to come” in line 30; and (7) the poor choice of words in the 
colloquial “nearby”’ and in the repeated use of “long ways.” 
COMPARISON: This theme is superior to No. 4 in its maturity of thought 
and phrasing; it is inferior to No. 2 in mechanical form.

A HAPPY BUT EXCITING AFTERNOON 
Allen had just gotten a new motor-boat for his birthday and wanted to try 
it out as it was Saturday. ‘Well,’ he said, “will you come with me Emily. 
“You can bring Edna if you wish.” 
“All right” said Emily, and off she went to get Edna, her cousin. 
They started out at Marblehead and was going to go as far out in the harbor 
as they could. 
All went well for about one hour, then it was getting rough. 
The girls got frightened, but, they had more to be frightened about later, the 
propellor broke off. All there was to do was to go where ever the waves would 
take them. 
They were heading for open sea. ‘‘Oh,”’ said Edna, ‘“‘how perfectly horrible.” 
“T’m not coming out in this motor-boat again,’’ said Emily. 
“T guess you won’t, Emily, but look, here comes a ferryboat.”” 
So it was, ‘‘now for the fun,” said Allen, who was not the least bit excited, 
“T’m going to call their attention.” 
The ship came nearer and nearer to them. Soon it was within reach and 
Allen made a grab for it. He got hold of the side and helped the girls in. Then 
he got a rope and tide it to the motor-boat. 
“Well,” said the girls to-gether, ‘‘we will never go in a motor-boat with you 
again. 
MERITS: The merits are two: (1) the child had a fairly well-planned story 
in mind; (2) he has an accurate knowledge of the use of quotation marks. 
DEFECTS: The defects are as follows: (1) the paragraphing is poor; (2) 
there are several examples of the ‘‘run-on”’ sentence (lines 7, 9, and 15); (3) the 
words “propeller,” ‘‘wherever,” “together,” and “tied” are misspelled; (4) 
“can”’ is used in line 3 instead of “may’’; (5) in line 5 there is a singular verb 
used with a plural subject; (6) there are errors in punctuation (lines 2, 9, 11, 
and 14); (7) the vocabulary is childish. 
COMPARISON: This theme follows No. 3 in the scale because of the inferior 
development of its plot and the greater immaturity of its expression.

“Come Joe, run faster we must get Harry to come with us and we have but

up with him so they could go in together.

They reached the house all out of breath. 
“Hullo boys! where are you going, can I beone company?” were the series 
of questions poured forth to John and Joe as they entered the house. 
John and Joe told them where they were going, and Harry readly consented 
to go. 
They reached the house and ate their supper and went to bed. 
They were not asleep long when Joe woke up and hollered for John and Harry 
to come to him because he saw a ghost. 
Harry jumped up and entered the room in which Joe was sleeping. 
“Where is the ghost,” he asked, “‘I don’t see any.” 
He is gone now, said Joe. In the morning they thought they would investi- 
ate. 
® The found it was only a white post and a white sheet behind it. They then 
started home and told their parents about their adventures. 
MERITS: The writer has a strong and dramatic opening, and throughout 
the theme handles his dialogue well. His sense of order is good and his vocabu- 
lary adequate. Such expressions as “the series of questions’ “poured forth” 
and “readily consented” are good. 
DEFECTS: The good promise of the beginning is not fulfilled; the climax is 
not worked up successfully and the whole trails off into a pointless incident. 
The mechanical errors are numerous; almost every sentence is made a separate 
paragraph; there are two examples of the ‘‘run-on’’ sentence (lines 1 and 15); 
there are several comma omissions and one use of a comma where there should 
be a question mark (line 15); there is an error in tense sequence (line 12); the 
words ‘‘of the” are omitted in line 7; “readily” is misspelled (line 10). 
COMPARISON: While more dramatic than No. 4, the theme is properly 
placed lower on account of the large number of mechanical errors and the drooping 
narrative interest.

LIFE IN A CABIN 
In a woods our cabin is which is made of logs. In side are two rooms furnished 
with rough hand made furniture. On the wall of the den hung skins and many 
pictures. 
We had to have something to eat so we had to find a river where we could 
fish. We got enough fish and soon they were over the fire frying. ' 
Next day an Indian came with some meat. We gave him a few coppers ha 
he was real pleased. . 
“Jingle, jingle,” was the noise out side as the horse galloped. It was cousen 
Joe. 
“Hurrah! now for some fun,” I cried. ‘‘Come tobogganing? See that hill 
over there well its great tobogganing.”’ 
“Come in,” said Joe, ‘till I get my moccasins?” 
What fun we had many tumbles we got. Just as we were going home we saw 
a deer laying in the snow. We crept up to him but he did not move. Than 
we put him on the toboggan and took him home. He was cold but we gave him 
some warm milk and he tryed to get up. But he could not. 
“Poor thing he must be hurt,” said Joe. ‘“‘His leg is broke don’t you see.”’ 
Then we bathed his leg and bound it. Soon he was able to stand on his legs 
and became a house pet. 
ss “Oh, dear its snowing,” said Joe, ‘‘Lets not go out as my snoweshoes are not 
ere. 
MERITS: The merits of this theme are: (1) an attempt to make an intro- 
ductory paragraph; (2) the introduction of conversation; (3) the use of inter- 
M

rogative and exclamatory sentences; (4) the simple and natural language; 
(5) the orderly sequence of points in the story. 
DEFECTS: Though well begun, after the first paragraph this theme is 
simply a series of disconnected events and apparently unrelated statements. 
(1) Punctuation is faulty; (2) sentences are badly constructed; (3) the meaning 
in several places is not clear; (4) there are many mechanical errors, such as 
“than” for “then’’; “broke” for “broken”; “laying” for “lying” ; “had” for 
“and”; (5) the apostrophe i is omitted in contractions; and (6) the tense changes 
abruptly i in the opening paragraph. 
COMPARISON: This theme is inferior to No. 5 in sentence structure, in 
connected arrangement of material, and in mechanical accuracy.

CHAPTER X 
THE MEASUREMENT OF ABILITY IN DRAWING 
The Thorndike Drawing Scale. A scale for measuring ability 
in drawing has been prepared by Thorndike on the same general 
principles as his scale for handwriting. It is composed of a series 
of fourteen drawings ranging in merit from zero to 17. The succes- 
sive steps of increase in merit are irregular, but the value of each draw- 
ing is accurately determined from the judgment of about 400 artists, 
teachers of drawing, and experts in education. 
The scale is used for rating the merit of a child’s drawing in the 
same manner as the handwriting scale is used for measuring samples 
of writing. The value of a drawing is indicated in terms of the step 
on the scale to which it is most like in quality. 
The chief difficulty in using the scale is the fact that it does not 
contain specimens of the various types of drawings made in school. 
The scale ought to be extended by adding samples of the proper 
degrees of merit for each of the most common classes of objects drawn 
in school, as, for example, animals, human beings, leaves, landscapes, 
etc. But in spite of this shortcoming, the scale is useful, and the 
ratings of drawings can be made more accurately with the scale 
than without the scale. 
Directions for Administering and Scoring the Test. Materials: 
White drawing paper, 6 X 9, black drawing pencil or crayon. 
General data: Have the pupils write on the back of the sheet the 
name, grade, school, city, and date. 
Subject: A picture or scene to illustrate the following stanza: 
Under a spreading chestnut tree 
The village smithy stands ; 
The smith, a mighty man is he, 
With large and sinewy hands; 
And the muscles of his brawny arms 
Are strong as iron bands. 
(Some other subject of comparable character may be used if it 
seems desirable.)

Time: Ten minutes, exclusive of all directions, preliminary ques- 
tions, and the recording of general data. No suggestions or help 
should be given. 
The drawings are then scored by the Thorndike scale. The results 
of a class should be tabulated to show the name of each pupil together 
with his score, and the average score for the entire class. 
General standards of attainment for the various years have not 
been obtained as yet. Childs! employed the scale for measuring 
drawings of 2177 pupils in two school systems in Indiana and found 
the following median scores, in which the results for A and B sections 
of each grade are combined :

The Rugg Lettering Scale. A scale for measuring free-hand let- 
tering has been constructed by H. O. Rugg. It consists of graded 
specimens of lettering ranging in value from 30 per cent to roo per 
cent. The specimens in the scale were selected from a large number 
of letterings made by a class in drawing in the college of engineer- 
ing in the University of Illinois. The value of the various samples 
was determined primarily on the basis of the uniformity of the letters 
in respect to heights of letters, spaces between the letters and be- 
tween the words, stems and ovals. The percentage of value assigned 
to a sample was determined by the number of defects in these four 
elements in the specimen. The exact method is described in detail 
by Mr. Rugg in the Journal of Educational Psychology, V1, 1915, 
25-42.

These words were selected by the same method as the words

page of Harper’s Latin Dictionary was chosen. The first word on every 20th 
very 20th page was 
selected because that gave 100 words scattered at uniform intervals 
throughout the entire vocabulary. List I was made up by taking 
the first word from pages 20, 40, 60, etc. 
taking the first word from pages 21, 41, 61, etc. 
This method of selection has three distinct advantages. List II was made up by 
First,
-P-A-G-E-185
THE MEASUREMENT OF ABILITY IN LATIN 175 
it- gives a representative and uniform sampling of the entire Latin 
vocabulary. Second, the score obtained has a definite significance 
in the sense that it indicates the percentage of words of the entire 
Latin vocabulary that a person knows. If a pupil knows 25 words 
of each list, it means that he knows 25 per cent of the entire vocabu- 
lary. Third, any number of additional lists that may be desired can 
be made up by following the same plan of selection. It has been found 
in connection with the English vocabulary test and the spelling test 
that this method of selection yields lists which do not differ from each 
other in difficulty on the average by more than 2.5 per cent, and that 
an average obtained from two lists gives a very reliable score. 
The method of matching the English equivalents with the Latin 
words is used in this test in preference to having the words defined 
or having them used in sentences because it makes the scoring abso- 
lutely objective. By means of a key, any one who may not know a 
word of Latin can score the results. All he needs to know is the 
correct number for each Latin word. Each word is designated either 
correctly or incorrectly. 
Latin Reading Test. This test is composed of a series of sentences 
arranged approximately in the order of difficulty. These sentences 
were selected from the readings usually covered in high schools, 
namely, first year Latin books, Cesar, Cicero and Virgil. The 
test is now being standardized and will, in its final form, have the 
sentences arranged in uniform steps of known difficulty. A pupil’s 
score will then be the most difficult step or set of sentences passed. 
In the meantime the test will be useful as it stands and may be scored 
simply by the number of sentences translated correctly.

CHAPTER XII 
THE MEASUREMENT OF ABILITY IN GERMAN 
Tue tests for measuring ability in German have been prepared 
on the same general principles as those for Latin. One test measures 
the size of a pupil’s vocabulary, and the other measures a pupil’s 
ability to read German.! 
German Vocabulary Test. The test is composed of two sets of 
1oo words each. The results are scored by ascertaining the number 
of words numbered correctly in each list. The average of the two 
lists is the score. 
These words were selected by taking the first word on every 23d 
page of the large Muret-Sanders German-English dictionary. Every 
23d page was chosen because that gave 100 words scattered at uni- 
form distances through the entire vocabulary. List I was obtained 
by taking the first word on pages 23, 46, 69, etc. List II was obtained 
by taking the first word on pages 24, 47, 70, etc. 
The critical points concerning the validity, reliability, advantages 
and limitations of the test are the same as those discussed in con- 
nection with the Latin test and need not be repeated here. 
GERMAN VOCABULARY TEST I 
After each German word that you know, write the number of its 
English equivalent.

German Reading Test. This test, like the Latin test, is composed 
of a series of sentences arranged roughly in the order of increasing 
difficulty. The sentences were selected from the first year texts 
and from the authors usually covered in four years of German. This 
test will be standardized by ascertaining the precise value of each 
sentence. The sentences will then be arranged in the order of 
definite steps. For the present the test will be useful as it stands 
and may be scored simply by the number of sentences translated 
correctly.

CHAPTER XIII 
THE MEASUREMENT OF ABILITY IN FRENCH 
Tue tests for measuring ability in French! are entirely similar in 
principle to the tests in Latin and German. 
French Vocabulary Test. The test is composed of two sets of 
too words each. The results are scored by ascertaining the number 
of words designated correctly in each list. The average of the two 
lists is the score. 
These words were selected by taking the first word on every sixth 
or seventh page alternately in Spiers and Surenne’s large French- 
English dictionary. This gave 100 words scattered at regular inter- 
vals through the entire vocabulary. List I was obtained by taking 
the first word on pages 6, 13, 19, 26, etc. List II was obtained by 
taking the first word on pages 7, 14, 20, 27, etc. 
FRENCH VOCABULARY TEST I 
After each French word that you know, write the number of its 
English equivalent.

French Reading Test. This test, like the Latin and German 
reading tests, is composed of a series of thirty sentences arranged. 
roughly in the order of increasing difficulty. The sentences were 
selected from first-year texts and from the readings usually covered 
in schools. The test will be standardized by further experimenta- 
tion and will be arranged in the form of a scale of steps of known 
value. For the present the test will be useful as it stands and 
can be scored by ascertaining the number of sentences translated 
correctly.

  CHAPTER XIV 
THE MEASUREMENT OF ABILITY IN PHYSICS 
Tue test for measuring knowledge of physics was prepared on two 
general principles. In the first place, a study of textbooks was made 
to ascertain the common elements in them, and in the second place, 
the facts for the test were arranged in the form of mutilated text. 
The ‘principle of the mutilated text seems to be sound and has been 
found useful in various types of psychological test work. 
A careful comparison was made of five textbooks widely used in 
high schools for the purpose of ascertaining the facts, principles, 
and laws that are treated in several or all of the books.! It was 
found that 170 principles, facts or topics were treated in four of the 
five texts, and 1o2 of the 170 were treated in all five books. These 
ro2 items are incorporated in the following seventy-five statements 
of the mutilated text. The test will be standardized by ascer- 
taining the relative value of the various statements by determining 
their difficulty. For the present, however, the test will be useful 
as it stands and may be scored by determining the number of state- 
ments that a pupil completes correctly. 
The test may be given in sections after each particular topic has 
been completed, or it may be given as a whole at the end of the 
course. ,

established scores. The following scoies were made by a class in a 
good high school which had spent fourteen weeks on mechanics. It 
will be noticed that the scores and the teacher’s marks agree very 
closely. The half scores are due to the fact that certain of the state-

  CHAPTER XV 
THE USE OF STANDARD TESTS IN SCHOOL EXPERIMENTS 
A creat deal of experimental work has been done in the psychol- 
ogy of individual differences and in the psychology of learning in 
general. But practically nothing has been done in the psychology 
of the learning of school subjects under school conditions. We 
have a very considerable body of facts about the learning of more or 
less artificial material such as syllables, words, poetry, prose and 
symbols of various sorts. We know something about the effect upon 
the rate of learning of such factors as the length and distribution 
of different periods of work, the length of the amount of material 
to be learned, logical versus rote learning, the effect of attention and 
effort, the occurrence of plateaus and the like. But there is not a 
single school subject regarding which we have anything more than 
a fragmentary psychology of the factors and conditions that affect 
the progress of learning that particular subject. Let us take as an 
illustration the subject of writing. We know, for example, little or 
nothing about the actual effect of the many complex factors that 
enter into the process of learning to write. We do not know whether 
pupils will make greater progress by emphasizing quality of writing, 
or speed of writing, or quality and speed simultaneously, or quality 
and speed alternately each for a given number of days or weeks. 
We do not know definitely what the optimum length of the writing 
period is, or what it ought to be for different ages in order to make 
possible the most rapid progress in relation to the time expended. 
We do not know whether formal drill in different types of movements 
such as ovals, vertical and slant lines, or whether practice instead 
with letters and words is productive of greater progress. We do 
not definitely know the actual effects of many other factors that 
might be enumerated, such as arm movements in the air, tracing of 
letters, visualization of the forms of letters, and so on. To be sure 
there are beginnings in these directions, but there is hardly a single 
194
-P-A-G-E-205
THE USE OF STANDARD TESTS IN SCHOOL EXPERIMENTS 195 
problem to which we can give a precise answer with scientific final- 
ity. A similar enumeration of the factors and problems in even 
greater complexity could be made in any other branch of instruc- 
tion. 
The point, therefore, that is to be emphasized in this connection 
is the necessity of enlisting the codperation of scientifically spirited 
educators to take up these problems for solution under school con- 
ditions, but controlled according to definite, rigorous procedure. 
Accordingly, an experimental procedure will be outlined which 
can be followed in the solution of a great many problems without 
interfering seriously with the normal operations of a school. We 
may designate this plan as the equal squad method. . This method 
has been used in a limited way in various types of investigations, 
not so much with human beings as with animals and plants in agri- 
cultural experiment stations. But it has promise of equally wide 
and fruitful application in experimental education as well. The 
general procedure of the equal squad method may be outlined as 
follows: Suppose we wish to determine whether pupils will make 
more rapid progress in learning to write when they strive for quality 
primarily, or for speed primarily, or for quality and speed simul- 
taneously. A grade of thirty pupils could be divided into three 
squads of ten each. These squads should be made up so as to have 
approximately equal initial ability. This could be done by making 
an initial test of their writing ability both as to speed and quality 
as measured by the number of letters written per minute and as 
tated by the Thorndike or the Ayres scale. The entire class of 
thirty pupils could be kept together, receive their instruction at the 
same time, for the same length of period, and from the same teacher, 
but each squad would be working for its own particular aim. At 
regular intervals the progress of the squads should be measured, tabu- 
lated and compared. Such an experiment would not interfere with 
the normal operation of the school or without entailing a great deal 
of extra work. All that would be required would be a teacher who 
would appreciate the conditions of a rigorously controlled experiment. 
There are scores of problems not only in writing but in all school 
subjects which could be attacked in precisely the same manner. 
Further illustrations follow :
-P-A-G-E-206
196 EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENTS 
In writing: (a) The length of the writing period; whether a 10, 
15 or 20 minute period would be the most profitable for the time 
spent. (b) Formal movement drill versus no such drill. 
In reading: (a) Silent versus oral reading. (b) Emphasis on 
speed, or on comprehension, or on both together. 
In spelling: (a) The learning of homonyms together or apart. 
(b) Column versus contextual spelling. (c) The learning of rules 
versus omission of rules. (d) The use of misspelling in all written 
work as a part of the spelling work. 
Would it not be wise for every school system, particularly the 
larger city school systems, to set aside one school or a part of one 
school as an experiment station for the investigation of the problems 
of education? I would suggest one school or even a part of one 
school rather than a wholesale experimentation in several schools 
or in the entire system, because the wholesale experiment is apt to 
go beyond the limits of a thoroughly controlled experiment and 
because the average teacher and the average principal do not appre- 
ciate the importance of observing strict scientific conditions. The 
particular school set aside could be equipped with properly qualified 
teachers who could be enlisted in experimental work. Such a plan 
would entail little or no extra cost and ought to be productive of 
inestimable good. Experiment stations in agriculture have made 
the science of agriculture and have yielded results of enormous 
value. 
Why has so little been done in the scientific study of educational 
problems? Chiefly for two reasons. First, we have not had the tools 
with which to make such experiments possible, and second, educators 
have lacked initiative and scientific temper to inaugurate and prose- 
cute educational experiments. 
Tools in the form of scales and tests are now at hand or are being 
developed. The scales and tests for measuring educational products 
will do for education, it is hoped, what the galvanometer has done 
for electricity, or what the thermometer has done for temperature, 
or what the balance and the footrule have done for mechanics. The 
science of dairying was practically impossible until the milk tester 
was invented. 
The chief use of educational measuring devices has consisted thus
-P-A-G-E-207
  THE USE OF STANDARD TESTS IN SCHOOL EXPERIMENTS 1097 
far in comparing class with class, school with school, or city with 
city. The next great problem before us is the task of measuring 
the effects of the numerous factors and conditions that alter the 
progress of learning. These details are set down here in the hope 
that scientifically minded educators may be stimulated in the en- 
deavor to solve these problems.

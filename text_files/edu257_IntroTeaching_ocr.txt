PREFACE 
An Introduction to Teaching may serve at least three 
functions. The first is that of guidance. Thousands of 
students enter the professional schools for the preparation 
of teachers without a clearly defined notion of the range of 
choice offered by the educational systems of the country. 
In most instances they have not made a careful analysis of 
their own fitness to teach, nor have they searchingly exam- 
ined the different kinds of work and attendant requirements 
with a view to selecting the teaching position for which they 
are best qualified. Such a process of study may be termed 
intra-professional guidance. It is also quite possible in an 
introductory course to study other occupations in order that 
the function of guidance may be extended. Misfits are to 
be deplored in any service, but nowhere can greater harm 
be rendered by the ill-adapted than in the teaching service. 
The guidance function of such a course as this, then, not 
only discharges an obligation to the profession of teaching, 
but performs a real service for the individual teacher by 
assisting in the solution of the problems of professional 
placement. 
The second is a survey function. Obviously, it is not 
unrelated to that of guidance. In fact, it parallels the first 
with the addition that it provides a preview of the field of 
professional education. The beginning teacher should enter 
the service fully realizing the duties it imposes and the 
standards it exacts. Among these duties and ideals is the 
technical preparation necessary. No one should undertake 
teaching who is unwilling to assume the responsibility of 
gees  
-P-A-G-E-6

securing the best possible preparation. Intelligent volition 
in this respect depends upon a knowledge of what lies ahead. 
The third function is basic to success in any occupation. 
Reference is made in this connection to a fundamental pro- 
fessional attitude. Other courses, readings, discussions, and 
observations will contribute to the development of this essen- 
tial qualification, but an introductory course as is suggested 
in these pages has an unusual opportunity to lay the founda- 
tion for professional pride so necessary to true success. 
It becomes quite clear that there are at least three distinct 
groups of beginning teachers who would gain by such a study 
as is here proposed. There is the group of young people, 
largely high-school graduates, whose members are just enter- 
ing upon their professional preparation in state teachers’ 
colleges, state normal schools, county normal schools, and 
city training schools. There is a second group, not unlike 
the first, which has taken advantage of the local high-school 
training class for teachers. The third is composed of the 
thousands who enter the teaching service without any pro- 
fessional preparation. For these three groups these pages are 
written in order to give the assistance indicated by the func- 
tions above stated. 
The course was not originally intended for advanced stu- 
dents of education, and the critic is respectfully urged to 
bear in mind that the treatment of subjects in this book is 
entirely from the viewpoint of beginning teachers and of 
beginning students of education. 
The content included was selected as the result of experi- 
mentation with various kinds of materials, chiefly drawn 
from the field of education over a period of two years with 
first semester normal-school students. During that time the 
needs and abilities of four entering classes (six sections) were 
studied in relation to this problem. 
Several considerations are important in preparing such a 
course. Among these are: (a) the variety of reasons for
-P-A-G-E-7
  
PREFACE ix 
entrance to professional schools for teachers; (b) the many 
adjustments necessary which are due to a relatively new 
environment; and (c) the tendency that prevails among 
instructors to assume greater capacities or more highly 
developed abilities on the part of students than is justifiable. 
Hence, abstract discussion should be gradually approached in 
order that the student may not become discouraged, and 
materials should be prepared and presented in simple 
language. 
The questions and problems at the end of each chapter are 
intended to stimulate further study. The bibliographies are 
relatively short but were chosen and annotated, keeping in 
mind the same needs of the student which throughout have 
guided the organization and presentation of the various 
materials. 
The author wishes to express his personal appreciation to 
the instructional staff and to his students of the Oswego 
State Normal and Training School for their helpful codpera- 
tion in the selection and organization of the content of this 
proposed course. He is also indebted to the several pub- 
lishers who have freely granted permission to quote from 
their copyrighted materials, individual acknowledgment be- 
ing made as the quotations appear. 
To Neil D. Mathews, Principal of the West Commerce 
High School of Cleveland, Ohio, the author wishes to express 
his deep gratitude for the time, effort, and ability so gener- 
ously contributed throughout the study of the problem.

AN INTRODUCTION TO 
TEACHING 
CHAPTER I 
THE PROFESSION OF TEACHING 
Teaching challenges our best effort. Our dreams, our 
hopes, our aspirations—in short, our altruistic natures 
seek opportunities for service. Teaching provides those 
opportunities and offers such a variety of ways of ex- 
pressing our ideals that our talents need not suffer a 
lack of full development. Vague desire to serve the 
cause of humanity should be specifically connected with 
definite objectives. In an introductory study of the pro- 
fession of teaching many elements must emerge to clarify 
our thinking. When the various factors become a con- 
scious part of our considerations of the problem, our 
dreams become potential realities, our hopes are identi- 
fied with possibilities, and our aspirations take the form 
of concrete ends toward which our energy and ability 
may be effectively directed. 
The Importance of Teaching 
“Utopia has no parliament, no politics, no private 
wealth, no business competition, no police nor prisoners, 
no lunatics, no defectives nor cripples, and it has none of 
these things because it has schools and teachers who are 
3 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
  4 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
all that schools and teachers can be.” + H. G. Wells, in 
this sentence quoted from Men Like Gods, issues to 
teachers everywhere the greatest challenge of modern 
times. Many a writer condemns the weaknesses of present 
teaching but fails to suggest so clearly the possible results 
of good teaching. This writer, a believer in progress 
through the right kind of education, would not discount 
the teaching of the past and present which actually con- 
tributes to progress, but in all probability he would charge 
teachers of the past with much of the responsibility for 
the failure of society to advance more rapidly. In his 
statement may be read not discouragement, only disap- 
pointment, not condemnation nor eulogism, neither taunt 
nor flattery, not despair, but_hope. Is it prophetic? To 
a certain extent it may be, but there appears in these 
words something more potent than prophecy, praise, or 
blame. To repeat, we are interested in the quotation 
because of its tremendous challenge. 
What is there more forceful in producing fruitful ac- 
tion than a sharp challenge? We are told by thoughtful 
students of human nature that the usual first reaction to 
a challenge is one of anger or resentment, and then that 
we cast about for means of justification of that which has 
been questioned. After the first mental flurry has passed, 
we who are more amenable to reason are then willing to 
weigh the evidence produced. Such a procedure involves 
judgment and subsequent conclusions which should lead 
te well directed and effective activity. In this case we 
may not bexéady to accept as desirable the conditions of 
Utopia depicted by Wells. But we can scarcely deny the

sion of the Macmillan Co., publishers.
-P-A-G-E-19
  
THE PROFESSION OF TEACHING 5 
inference that there is room for improvement in all phases 
of life and, what is of vital importance, our individual 
responsibility as members of the teaching profession. If 
the acceptance of this challenge means action, then let us 
prepare for the struggle. We may be shocked by the 
audacity of the criticism; it may drag us from our com- 
fortable resting places; it may make us furious, but it 
should result in a reconsideration of conditions, a reor- 
ganization of forces, and a firm resolution to make the 
best use of the opportunities presented. 
Early in the field of professional activity deliberation 
upon conditions related to teaching will be of prime im- 
portance. What isa profession? Is teaching a profession ? 
There are some who will at present answer the last question 
negatively, others will stoutly uphold the affirmative view. 
None deny its potentiality as a profession. _ 
How Modern Teaching Developed.—The eoneeption of 
modern teaching considered in its professional setting pre- 
sents quite a contrast to teaching as it is pictured by the 
history of education. It is commonly thought that Plato 
and Aristotle were great teachers, and so they were, but the 
professional aspects were not in evidence. People went to 
them for advice because their fame had spread afar. Stu- 
dents of a philosophic turn discoursed with them, but they 
were not thought of at that time as teachers. It was quite 
natural that, as knowledge increased, some form of record- 
ing and transmitting it would be created, and as group 
cultures and tribal lines increased in importance, the 
problem of formal instruction received more and more 
attention. As the church crystallized into being and its 
doctrines gained importance in the lives of men, teaching 
became a necessity. At first the monks studied with little

assistance, but soon it was found expedient to provide some 
direction, and in the end regular classes were formed for 
purposes of instruction. All this had only the remotest 
bearing upon the general mass of humanity. The instruc- 
tion was intended only for those who were to assume 
ecclesiastical authority. 
Teaching remained in varying and uncertain forms until 
the sixteenth century when the Jesuits felt the necessity 
of better preparation for the work of the members of their 
order and formed training schools where students were 
taught how to teach in a way which might be more effec- 
tive. The problem was not primarily one of content but 
| one of emphasis upon methods of instruction. It meant a 
’ way of perpetuating the doctrines of their particular reli- 
gious order. The Reformation can be credited with this 
and other similar tendencies as giving an added impetus 
to education, and from that time progress in the develop- 
ment of teaching, from the standpoint both of theory and 
organization, was much more rapid. Normal schools were 
formed in Germany and in France, and, as we know, the 
movement spread throughout the civilized world. Ger- 
many, frightened by the might of Napoleon, sought some 
means of making her national safety secure and concluded 
that a strong system of education would serve her purposes. 
She at once developed a powerful centralized system of edu- 
cation with results which are well known. France at the 
present time has a highly centralized system. England 
developed her educational organization through the estab- 
lishment of higher standards for teachers, and the local 
units of administration were permitted to meet the situ- 
ation according to their own conditions. The United 
States became conscious of the need of professionally
-P-A-G-E-21
  THE PROFESSION OF TEACHING 7 
educated teachers late in the eighteenth century, and from 
the middle of the nineteenth century the development, 
though diverse, has been certain. Private academies in 
the East in time gave way to state control. In the West 
the states from the start assumed the initiative. At present 
there are about 346 public training centers for teachers, 
172 of which are state normal schools and state teachers 
colleges, the rest being city training schools and county 
normal schools. There still exist nearly fifty private insti- 
tutions for the professional education of teachers. 
The Nature of Professional Life 
When a nation recognizes public education of its teach- 
ing body, teaching may then be said to don its professional 
robes. But Anton Lang, as much as he resembles the 
Christ in dress and action, would scarcely presume to take 
the part of the greatest character in the history of man- 
kind if he were to rely upon external appearances alone. 
Anton Lang since childhood, we are told, has tried to 
adjust himself to approach the beautiful self of the Christ 
to as high a degree as is humanly possible. Indeed, the 
people of Oberammergau in selecting one of their number 
for this all-important part in the famous Passion Play 
would not consider for a moment one who had done less 
to merit the assignment. 
So, in the development of teaching as a profession, it 
follows that mere recognition of the importance of teaching 
does not justify the use of the term profession. An exami- 
nation of some aspects of the problem, even though cur- 
sory, will serve to reveal positive reasons for the designa- 
tion suggested. W. E. Wickenden, director of the Board 
of Investigation and Coérdination of the Society for the
-P-A-G-E-22
  8 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
Promotion of Engineering Education has formulated ten- 
tatively the aspects of individual and group professional 
life as follows: 
I. Arrriputes or Inprvinvat Proressionau Lire 
1. A motive of service which is exalted above con- 
siderations of personal gain—in the strict sense 
there are no profits in professional life. 
2. A motive of self-expression which implies a joy in 
one’s work and a single standard of workmanship 
—one’s best. 
83. A conscious recognition of social duty to be accom- 
plished, among other means, by 
(a) Sharing advances in professional knowledge. 
(b) Guarding the standards and ideals of one’s 
profession and advancing it in public un- 
derstanding and esteem. 
(c) Rendering gratuitous public service, in ad- 
dition to direct professional services, as a 
return for special advantages of education 
and status. 
II. Arrrwures or Group Proressionat Lire 
1. A body of knowledge (science) and skill (art) of 
such extent and character that it cannot be readily 
picked up by a versatile amateur or laboriously 
acquired by an apprentice. 
2. An educational process of professional aims, which 
implies the existence of professional schools or 
their equivalent. 
83. A standard of qualifications for admission to the 
professional group, based on character, education 
and competency. 
4. A standard of conduct in relations to colleagues, 
clients and the public, based on honor, courtesy 
and ethics. 
A recognition of status by colleagues or by organized 
society, as a basis of good standing. 
6. Organization of the professional group, based on com- 
mon interest and social duty. (Not universal in Ra
-P-A-G-E-23
  THE PROFESSION OF TEACHING 2° 
the artistic professions.) While professional or- 
ganizations restrict their membership by standards 
of qualification, they may not properly maintain 
the economic exclusiveness of guilds or trade 
unions. 
It is significant that the motive of service is given first 
rank in this classification. In connection with service 
self-expression is found, but both lose their greatest value 
unless jointly considered with “a conscious recognition 
of social duty.” 
We as teachers find ourselves in full accord with this 
analysis of our individual ambitions. Does teaching find 
itself in harmony with the classification of factors of 
group professional activity? Later, education, in the 
sense in which teachers consider it, will be discussed as 
a science. And, teaching is undoubtedly the finest of the 
fine arts, dealing as it does with the most precious of raw 
materials, demanding as it does the highest type of inter- 
pretation, and requiring as it does the most highly de 
veloped skill for creative purposes. We believe that the 
most careful preparation is none too well made to meet 
the exacting demands upon a successful teacher, and, as 
prerequisites, character, education, and competency are 
indispensable. We believe in ethical standards in the 
abstract at least, and it seems reasonable to suppose that the 
most successful teachers are as meticulous in their observ- 
ance of ethical procedure as are members of other accredi- 
ted professions. And so on the parallel may be continued. 
To accept these attributes of professional activity, or 
similar ones, is to acknowledge that unremitting atten- 
tion must be given to the various elements. To urge 
teaching as a profession is to pledge one’s best to main- 
tain the high standards set forth. That requires the most
-P-A-G-E-24
10 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
careful preparation possible. The time has come in the 
development of teaching as a profession when we as 
members have a right to demand the best from those who 
aspire to the obligations of the high office of teaching. 
The Advantages of Teaching 
To clarify the problem of stating what teaching means 
as a profession a quotation is here made from the Journal 
of the National Education Association.? The advantages 
of our profession are admirably set forth: 
4. 
7 Teaching pays. Besides ever-increasing financial compen- 
sation, the teaching profession offers the highest social 
sanctions and rewards. 
Teaching is a growing profession. The nation now re- 
quires the services of 700,000 teachers. There is a strong 
demand that teachers be better trained. As training 
increases, the financial and social rewards likewise in- 
crease. 
Teaching offers a growing career. The well-trained teacher 
_need have no fear of unemployment, but may look’ for- 
ward to increasing opportunities commensurate with 
added training and growth in personal fitness. 
Teaching offers mental and moral growth. The soundest 
mental and moral processes are involved in the making 
of good citizens. 
Teaching is building. The teacher shapes the unfolding 
life of childhood and radiates ideals and purposes that in 
the citizenship of to-morrow will become the fabric of 
an improved social structure. 
Teaching inspires high ideals. There is nothing nobler 
or more practical than to shape and to guide the ideals 
and practices of the young citizens who are soon to be the 
nation’s responsible leaders. 
Teaching is service. Those who enter this high calling en- 
- joy the- spiritual development and true happiness that 
come from rendering real service to the republic.

8. Teaching insures big opportunities. With growth and 
inspiration come multiplied opportunities for self-im- 
provement, for rearing the family in a wholesome atmos- 
phere, and for living and building on life’s best side. 
9. Teaching is practical patriotism. Inspiring young citizens 
and directing problems of citizenship practice is a minis- 
try essential to a democracy. 
10. Teaching zs the profession of professions. Measured by 
the standards that make life genuinely rich and happy, 
teaching offers opportunities beyond those of other pro- 
fessions. Teaching is the clearing-house of the past, the 
guide of the present, and the prophet of the future. It 
is therefore necessary that the nation’s finest talents 
should be consecrated to public education upon which 
the perpetuity of American ideals and the salvation of 
the Republic depend. 
If the beginning teacher is confronted by the question, 
“Why should I teach?’ the foregoing may serve to sat- 
isfy the interrogator. The most insistent and persistent 
questioner is one’s self. If your hopes are not stimulated 
by the above analysis, or should you feel that there is 
something wanting in this exposition of teaching as a 
profession, it is quite likely that you are better fitted for 
other duties in life. There is need for all types of abili- 
ties, but no misplacement of talent could possibly do more 
harm than in the profession of teaching. The materials 
with which a teacher labors are too precious to risk uncer- 
tain attitudes and uncertain abilities possessed by those 
who lack in any degree the fundamental elements of suc- 
cess—consecration to the work at hand and adequate 
personal equipment to reach the ends sought. 
The Present Status of Teaching 
With the tremendous growth of the country the prob- 
lems of public education in the United States have devel- 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
    12 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
oped to enormous proportions. There are at present about 
21,000,000 children enrolled in the public schools, taught 
by nearly 700,000 teachers. Judged by the training and 
experience of teachers the situation is not encouraging. 
More than two million children are taught by teachers 
having less preparation than that afforded by the elemen- 
tary school. They are not only poorly trained, but they 
are young and inexperienced. We have adopted for the 
present a standard preparation of two years beyond an 
accredited four-year high-school course. Only 20 per cent 
of our huge teaching force have met or surpassed the 
standard. The state normal schools graduate annually 
approximately 21,000 teachers, and 90,000 are needed for 
the rural schools alone. Certainly no profession offers 
more room for exceptional ability than the profession of 
teaching. To say that it presents unlimited opportunities 
for service is trite. 
What the future of teaching may be is difficult to fore- 
cast. It presents a possible career of many attractions, 
but it is not a career for the seeker of wealth as measured 
by worldly riches. It affords an opportunity to exercise 
great power, although probably unrecognized. With this 
power one must consider its possible use. There are grave 
dangers to be avoided. Fame in the profession has been 
restricted to a few who have held positions of prominence. 
The classroom teacher has been virtually excluded from the 
halls of fame. At present the emphasis shows an inclina- 
tion to shift, not from the great thigkers, authors, lec- 
turers, and administrators, but toward the classroom 
teacher as an added factor of importance. Truly the 
classroom teacher deserves recognition, and great skill 
should not pass unrewarded by public acclamation. Upon  
-P-A-G-E-27

this point lies a great hope for a greater professional 
consciousness. 
Complexity of Teaching Problems 
It is quite obvious that as society became more complex 
by reason of increased numbers, closer communication, 
facilitated transportation, national consciousness, indus- 
trial development, etc., that the quality of the individval 
became an increasingly important problem. A matter of 
such vital significance could not be left to chance, and, as 
indicated before, the development of systems of education 
grew apace. Only as the individual grows properly can 
society hope to progress. Man has learned that organiza- 
tion facilitates the transmission of knowledge, the develop- 
ment of skills, and the creation of ideals. Systems of 
education were inevitable. Teachers became a necessity, 
and the quality of teaching took its place as one of society’s 
most acute problems. 
The young child must grow physically and mentally. 
The direction of his mental development needs to be safe- 
guarded as does his physical growth. It would be absurd 
to rely upon natural impulses to develop without some 
direction at opportune times. Hence, wise leadership is 
- imperative. The danger lies in interpreting direction as 
arbitrary control. The problem of heredity and environ- 
ment must not be left to accident. 
Questions AND ProBLemMs 
1. Recall a personal experience in which your attitude or 
what you had already done was severely criticized. Describe 
your feelings at the time. What did you do? Would you act 
differently now under similar circumstances? Why? Would 
another person be likely to respond as you did? What is the
-P-A-G-E-28
  
14 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
analogy between your experience and the sharp criticism of 
H. G. Wells about “schools and teachers”? What should be done 
about such a criticism? Who can best do it? How should it 
be undertaken? How long must the effort continue? What 
may be the results? 
2. What is language? How important has language been 
in the course of civilization? What other devices have con- 
tributed to means of communication? Are these various devices 
used in schools? To what extent would teaching be curtailed 
by the absence of a spoken language? 
8. You have read in this chapter a characterization of pro- 
fessional life. You have indicated your interest in teaching. 
Check your ideas of teaching which seem to you to prevail 
against each item in Wickenden’s classification of the attributes 
of professional life. Does the result challenge you or render 
you complacent? Why? 
4, Illustrate each point in the classification of attributes of 
professional life, drawing from school life either as a student 
or as a teacher. The illustration, if well taken, should reveal 
two things: (a) the value of doing one’s best; and (b) the need 
of doing some things better. What has been done can probably 
be done again and may be improved. 
5. Prepare both sides of the following debate: Resolved, 
that teaching offers greater attractions than any other occupa- 
tion. 
6. Suppose that during a casual conversation with a neigh- 
bor you find that he believes that teachers do not need special 
training. He taught school with no training beyond high 
school, and was considered a successful teacher. Taxes are high, 
and he sees you in a state teachers college or normal school, 
or in a municipal institution of like character which he is in 
part supporting. His children have had one of these “expen- 
sive” graduates, and, as he sees it, know far less than he did 
at their ages, and his teacher never even attended high school. 
Will you meekly agree that he is right, or will you avoid the 
issue entirely? There is still another alternative. You can 
present facts which will convince any reasonably intelligent 
taxpayer that money invested in teacher preparation should 
bring high returns. Are you ready to present such an argu- 
ment? If not, now is the time to prepare for just such a 
challenge. You owe it to yourself and to the profession to be 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
  
THE PROFESSION OF TEACHING 15 
ready at all times to defend yourself and the high calling of a 
teacher against unwarranted and unjustifiable attacks. 
7. Classify types of positions in the school world. Are any 
more important than that of a teacher? Justify your answer. 
8. To what extent is your interest in teaching or your attend- 
ance at a school which prepares teachers in a professional way 
dependent upon circumstances and accident? Assuming that 
your presence in this course, or your reading of such type book 
as this is, is not wholly the result of cold reasoning, what are 
your obligations from now on toward teaching? How do you 
propose to discharge those obligations?

CHAPTER II 
SPECIAL PROBLEMS OF TEACHING 
It has been found advisable at the beginning of an intro- 
ductory course for teachers to point out the professional 
aspects of teaching with emphasis upon the advantages of 
this attractive occupation. That has been followed by a 
general treatment of the meaning of teaching, together 
with qualifications and requirements which apply in the 
main to all teachers. An attempt is then made to furnish 
the novitiate with a balanced perspective of school educa- 
tion through a discussion of formal and informal agencies, 
stressing in that connection the variety and general char- 
acter of typical public-school agencies which exist in more 
or less modified form throughout the United States. At- 
tention is then directed to the importance of a careful con- 
sideration of teaching as compared to other well known 
professional and business occupations. To assist the stu- 
dent in reaching a decision or in confirming beliefs this 
chapter suggests additional problems of teaching. After 
due deliberation over this section of the study, made pos- 
sible through readings, observations, and discussions, the 
beginner, it is hoped, will feel better equipped to decide 
whether or not he should remain in the profession or seek 
what appears to him to be a more acceptable line of work. 
Regardless of the outcome of this careful deliberation, the 
purpose will have been fulfilled. Further study should .

enable him, if he concludes to teach, to select more wisely 
his special field of interest within the profession. It is 
not intended that the decision shall of necessity be reached 
at this point in the course. The thoughts resulting from 
study should be given time to mature. Part II gives a 
survey of the field of professional study. This should 
serve to make the concrete problems more readily under- 
stood in the language of educational theory. Constant 
alertness for teaching problems in the observation periods 
will form an important part in making the subsequent 
class discussions more vital. 
Teaching as a Temporary Occupation 
Many young people have entirely worthy ambitions to 
secure attractive positions in the business world or to seek 
a recognized status as a specialist in one of the more stand- 
ardized professional fields. In realizing their ambitions 
financial problems perhaps loom large on their horizon. 
To solve this difficulty, they mentally cast about for em- 
ployment. If their elementary and secondary education 
has been given due time and attention, teaching makes an 
appeal to them as a convenient means of attaining their 
desired ends. Unconsciously this group acts on the theory 
that the end justifies the means. From the standpoint of 
the aspirant for ultimate success in other fields, the means 
(teaching, in this case) present many advantages. They 
may live where teacher-certification either blindly or neces- 
sarily has become a slight obstacle for the candidate. 
Teachers may be scarce, standards may be low, appoint- 
ment may easily be secured, working conditions may 
appear to be more favorable than in other possible forms 
of activity, and the financial reward certain, if not munifi-

cent. And so the young man or the young woman under- 
takes teaching, all the while promising himself or herself 
that it is to be a temporary occupation. Many times they 
find it easier to remain in school work; some are actually 
converted to the profession through this enforced intimate 
contact with the exceptional opportunities which teaching 
affords; but the risk is too great to warrant the toleration 
of such chance factors. Do we mean that the risk is 
unfair to the teacher under such conditions? Quite the 
contrary. The teacher is bound to profit personally by the 
valuable experiences made possible in any teaching situa- 
tion. The necessity of meeting and solving problems, the 
expanded outlook upon life through personal contacts with 
children, parents, and other members of a community, all 
. such factors are bound to react favorably even upon the 
transient teacher. How, then, can serious objection: be 
sustained? The answer to that question lies in the disas- 
trous effects attendant upon any situation in which perfect 4 
creative art is subjected to the bungling efforts of the / fe 
incompetent. Teaching is a creative art. Perfection in” 
teaching is the result of personal fitness, adequate prepara- 
tion, and natural ability, and not a by-product of chance 
or accident. ‘The outcomes of good teaching are character, 
ability to adjust one’s individuality to the end that social 
problems may be more adequately met, a broader outlook 
upon life, the development of vocational abilities, a more 
highly crystallized appreciative sense, and the like,—in 
short, the most invaluable of all human values. Shall 
these outcomes be entrusted to the flitting dilettante or to 
the true artist? There can be but one reply. The question 
implies the answer that will be made by every conscien- 
tious parent in the land.

  20 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
Magnitude of the Service 
In its strict sense teaching is universal. That is to say, 
every one is a teacher in some degree and of some kind. 
School teaching then becomes only a part, but an organized 
part, of the vast amount of teaching. Such a conception 
should not result in the inference that school teaching 
should be minimized. It is convenient and proper to use 
the term teacher in the professional sense. Even from 
this point of view teaching offers a tremendous sweep of 
influence. There are the children of pre-school, legal- 
school, and post-school age, and the vast number of adults 
who make use of school facilities, the exceptionally 
bright child, the mentally deficient, or in other terms the 
super-normal and the sub-normal, which assumes a stand- 
ard of normality somewhere between the two extremes. 
There are the physical defectives,—deaf, blind, mute, 
crippled, diseased. In this country there is the special 
problem, in multiple form, of the foreign-born and of the 
first generation descendants of the foreign-born. There is 
the problem of urban education and one of rural education 
none the less acute. Conditions point to the urgent need 
of education which will meet political issues, religious 
prejudices, the problem of social adjustment, industrial 
unrest and economic differences, racial distinctions, and 
international relations. The field of the teacher is un- 
limited. The big question is to select that portion of the 
service for which one’s aptitudes, inclinations, and experi- 
ences best fit him. It is not then a problem of realizing 
what needs to be done, but of determining where one can 
function best. Truly, no profession offers greater oppor- 
tunities, and certainly none presents a wider field for con- 
structive work. The scope of teaching appeals to the imag-
-P-A-G-E-35
  
SPECIAL PROBLEMS OF TEACHING 21 
ination, and, in an unprecedented fashion, presents the 
challenge of challenges. 
Length of Service 
We have protested against temporary service. That, of 
course, needs to be qualified by defining temporary service 
as uninspired, undevoted, unconsecrated, and unintelligent 
time-serving. We do not contend that there can be no 
turning away to other fields, nor that, in the case of 
women, matrimony should be foresworn. The main point 
in the argument against temporary service is in condemn- 
ing mere time-serving and pay-day roll calls. If temporary 
service carries with it the earnestness of purpose coupled 
with careful and extensive preparation, there can be no 
serious objection. “Under such conditions the child suffers 
little if at all. In fact, many hold that the enthusiasm of 
youth should be well mixed with the deliberate activity of 
maturity. There is a danger in long service quite as real 
as that in temporary service. If the teacher suffers mental 
stagnation, the effect upon the deyelopment of the children 
of the school is positively harmful. A successful teacher 
will be a perpetual student, professionally alert and men- 
tally receptive. A growing teacher insures successful ~ 
teaching. Opportunities for professional development are 
offered through reading courses, extension courses, corre- 
spondence courses, summer session study, travel, experi- 
mental or laboratory work, and individual reading. Bagley 
characterizes these various forms as “in-service” educa- 
tion. It makes useful long service possible. Preparation 
undertaken before experience has had a remarkable growth 
in this country. We are on the verge of a “boom” in “pre- 
service” education. It is claimed and verified by facts
-P-A-G-E-36
  22 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
that length of service increases with length of preparation. 
That is significant at a time when normal schools and 
teachers colleges are gradually extending the length of 
“pre-service” education. 
Teaching offers relatively permanent tenure. The suc- 
cessful teacher need not lack for employment. The trend 
in policy is not in the direction of definite or permanent 
tenure but toward indefinite tenure. Indefinite tenure is 
fair to the teacher and to the children of the community. 
-It means that as long as acceptable service is rendered that 
tenure is assured. Strain from worry over uncertainty in 
reappointment is eliminated. Many students of the prob- 
lem urge a probationary period, of one or two years for 
the beginning teacher, and then, if work is satisfactory, 
appointment for an indefinite period. Unprofessional 
conduct in private life or incompetency are then the fac- 
tors terminating the relationship between the teacher and 
the agency responsible to the people for good schools. 
Such conditions of employment present a relatively favor- 
able comparison to many other occupations in which tenure 
is uncertain due to possible arbitrary dismissal or changing 
factors in the economic status of the employing agency. 
Financial Remuneration 
There are several well-known popular magazines which 
undertake to stimulate ambition and hard work by pre- 
senting to their readers a biographical sketch of the excep- © 
tionally successful business or professional man or woman. 
Very frequently in reading these articles, we are impressed 
that they have attained unusual financial success as well 
as prominence and recognition. The “high-powered” 
business executive of Corporation X is paid. an annual 
yi 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
  
ae 
SPECIAL PROBLEMS OF TEACHING 23 
salary of $100,000. Besides that, he holds an enviable 
proportion of the company’s stock, has an attractive title, 
is a member of the board of directors of his own company, 
- and perhaps of several others. Some outstanding attorney- 
at-law or a famous surgeon or a member of a firm of con- 
sulting engineers has a yearly income of thousands of dol- 
lars. Usually this successful individual has a country 
home in the mountains or by the ocean, a city residence, 
he has traveled widely, drives costly automobiles, has 
servants, has expensive hobbies. It is quite true that the 
teacher who dreams of such conditions for himself is bound 
to be greatly disappointed. The mistake is made, of 
course, in comparing the average salaries of teachers (less 
than $1,500 per year) to these upper levels of income 
among only a very few exceptionally successful people. 
The comparison is obviously unjust. The average is not 
“played up” in newspapers and magazines, and so teachers 
do not weigh averages against averages. If they did, the 
resulting contrasts would be far more favorable to teach- 
ing. No defense is made for present salary schedule for 
teachers, but the truth is not clearly revealed to the casual 
reader when an average is the item mentioned. In teach- 
ing the average is obtained by considering the whole range 
of salaries, from the poorest salaries paid in the economi- 
cally poorest country districts to the most opulent urban 
communities. The general trend has been to increase 
teachers’ salaries and there has been no serious retardation 
.of this trend since the World War, which time marked a 
period of pecuniary inflation throughout the country. But 
the fact remains that the teacher who is actuated by 
motives of great financial gain alone is misplaced. 
Another factor which is in favor of teaching is the move-  
-P-A-G-E-38
  24 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
ment in many states to provide liberal pension and retire- 
ment systems. The beginning teacher finds it difficult to 
visualize himself at the retirement age. The pension and 
retirement provisions made by legal enactment are in many 
cases a distinct advantage to the individual teacher, and 
constitute an important consideration from the financial 
standpoint. 
Fortunately most successful teachers have more worthy 
motives than mere financial remuneration, as important in 
our economic system as that is at present. The teacher in 
yall probability for some time to come must be relatively 
“ satisfied by a monetary return which provides for himself 
and his dependents comfortable living conditions, means 
for a moderate amount of travel, a few luxuries, and a 
surplus to insure proper care of himself or his dependents 
in case of illness and to provide for the necessities of life 
after the age of retirement. That is much more than thou- 
sands upon thousands of people enjoy. 
It seems an untenable theory that increase in salary 
alone will result in more competent teachers, but it seems 
to be a safe assumption that successful teaching will 
eventually result in salary increases. 
Social Conditions 
Most people who identify themselves with a community 
new to them are forced to earn whatever eminence they 
attain in the established social life. Teachers on the con- 
trary are introduced by reason of their position before they 
“ yeach the community. This is particularly true in the 
smaller villages, towns, and cities, and is sufficiently true 
of the larger cities to be a very real factor. To be known 
as a teacher means that the desirable element of any com-
-P-A-G-E-39
RAR oe Se ee Re ee EE RT ON COR RA SO Se ee een ee 
SPECIAL PROBLEMS OF TEACHING 25 
munity accepts one on equal social terms. One is then per- 
mitted to share in the social and civic functions and con- 
tinues to do so until he disqualifies himself. This is a real 
advantage because of the increased opportunities thus 
offered for extensive community service. This ready ac 
ceptance does not mean that one is retained as socially 
desirable just on the grounds that he is a teacher. He 
must merit retention. If there are any social undesirables 
in a community, to be given an opportunity to exert one’s 
personal influence in eliminating such a condition is a 
real privilege. And to be worthy of leadership of such a 
character one must appreciate social problems as well as 
be able to solve them. The teacher’s opportunity for both 
is unexcelled. 
Other Rewards of Teaching 
Unworthy sentimentality in teaching is to be deplored. 
Worthy sentiment is to be encouraged. A sincere and 
capable teacher develops a sentiment among pupils which 
is reflected all through later life. What greater reward can 
come to one than the testimony of those for whom one has 
labored. A successful physician once told of the remark- 
able influence of one of his teachers. He stated that 
largely through the influence of that teacher he and 
many of his schoolmates were saved from a relatively color- 
less life in an isolated community. This group of boys 
had been fired by the vision and enthusiasm of their 
teacher. Their sphere of usefulness had been increased 
thereby. Some had studied law, some medicine, others 
became teachers, clergymen, engineers, scientists, and so 
on. That teacher has been told many times that her work 
in that relatively obscure school had been a powerful factor  
-P-A-G-E-40
  26 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHiNG 
in creating for these men a new vision—a new world. No 
eater reward can come than the knowledge of work well | 
/ Qone, of service well rendered, of boys and girls encour- 
aged and directed to better and more useful lives. One 
remembers James Whitcomb Riley’s “Tod,” the boy who 
ran away to join a circus and how, when the news came of 
the death of his former teacher, he hurried back home, and 
was found weeping on the new grave of his old and trusted 
friend. That to-morrow may be better than to-day is the 
~end of education. The teacher who contributes to that 
desired transformation is of the chosen few. The reward 
is likely to be commensurate with the achievement. 
Professional Ethics 
One of the elements which tends to develop in the legal, 
medical, and engineering professions a strong professional 
consciousness is the written or unwritten code of ethics 
which prevails. There have been many serious and worthy 
attempts to formulate such a code for teachers, but much 
remains to be done. Many times loyalty is mentioned as 
an ethical factor. What is meant by loyalty? Is it a rela- 
tionship to our chosen occupation as expressed by word 
and deed? Is it relationships among individual members 
of the group? If so, what are the limitations? Does it 
mean we cannot criticize a colleague? If not, when may 
we so criticize him, and how shall it best be done? What 
principles should govern contractual relationships? What 
factors need to be considered in applying for a position ? 
In leaving one? Is the careful observance of professional 
qualifications of new entrants important? Is it ethical to 
remain in the profession in the face of recognized unfit- 
ness? Ethical values affect all relationships. The prob-
-P-A-G-E-41
: SPECIAL PROBLEMS OF TEACHING 27 
lems are merely introduced at this point so that there may 
be no excuse later for a lack of recognition of the existence 
of the problem. Each teacher needs to formulate or accept 
a creditable code of professional ethics. 
The Teacher and the Parent L- 
How & the teacher best help the parent and how can 
the parent best help the teacher in their common problems ? 
Obviously, not by remaining mutually aloof. On the other 
hand there are dangers to be avoided in attempting co- 
operation. In teaching reading a skillful instructor will 
develop certain ‘responses, reading skills. The parents can 
neutralize all this classroom product by teaching another 
set of reading habits at home, or they can supplement the 
work of the teacher. That assumes, of course, a familiar 
knowledge of what the teacher is doing. The parents easily 
misjudge the teacher’s actions, and it is equally easy for 
the teacher to misunderstand the parents. 
An illustration will serve to clarify the statement of the 
problem. A mother had two children, a boy and a girl, 
in a certain school. The teacher wisely made an effort 
to win the friendship of this mother as she did in all 
other cases. That friendship, when founded upon com- 
plete confidence in professional ability as well as personal 
approval, later proved to be a fortress of strength. The 
girl did very satisfactory school work; the boy did very 
unsatisfactory school work; the girl had a delightful dis- 
position ; the boy was rude and unbridled. The sister was 
popular among the schoolmates; her brother was always 
in trouble with them. Finally a crisis seemed imminent. 
The boy had flagrantly overstepped the bounds of endur- 
ance. The teacher was fully aware of the child’s limita- 
 
-P-A-G-E-42

28 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
tions, resulting from too much leniency at home. The 
father was a man of creditable intellectual attainments, 
but possessed an ingrained coarseness of manner. He 
lacked the fine sensibilities of a gentleman. The mother 
possessed both refinement and education, but was unable 
in influencing her son to offset the uncouth habits Jearned 
from the father. These habits had taken no form worse 
than “bad manners.” The teacher and the mother, both 
sensing the difficulty, were together able to adjust the boy 
to the nicer problems of group association. Probably 
neither would or could have accomplished the task single- 
handed. The situation represents the possibilities of un- 
derstanding and sympathetic codperation of parents and 
teachers in solving the myriad problems of developing 
childhood.

The Teacher and the Community 
The importance of the various informal agencies created © 
by community enterprise has been discussed under another 
caption. At this point the question to be considered is 
the extent to which a teacher should actively participate 
in community undertakings. Obviously, community work 
offers a splendid opportunity to help meet local needs, 
and it is altogether likely that the teacher should show a 
~real interest in community affairs. The people of any 
locality should never be given cause for thinking that . 
school taxes were in part being paid to teachers whose 
civic interests were largely elsewhere. The teacher un- 
doubtedly should be a whole-hearted local citizen. On the- 
other hand, there is danger of community enterprise re- 
quiring time and energy of the teacher to the detriment 
of the primary purpose for which he is appointed. There 
 
-P-A-G-E-43
  SPECIAL PROBLEMS OF TEACHING 29 
probably is some point beyond which the teacher should 
not pass in attempting too much “outside” or community 
work. To recognize that point and to decline to pass 
beyond it is not shirking civic responsibility, but display- 
ing professional wisdom. No general statement can cover 
the location of that point. That is a problem for each 
individual teacher. 
Since teachers’ problems are innumerable, we shall not 
attempt to indicate more in this chapter. Professional 
problems will constantly take form and appear in recur- 
ring order. The beginning teacher should not enter the 
work blind to some of the major issues, and should con- 
tinue in the teaching profession alert for new problems 
and old problems, with a willingness to attempt their solu- 
tion unflinchingly. Life is a continuous struggle. Teach-—— 
ing is the greatest of life’s opportunities. Therefore we 
should welcome struggle—that struggle which aids social 
progress—and meet the bafiling situations of teaching as 
well prepared as the best professional equipment can 
insure.

CHAPTER III 
OTHER OCCUPATIONS 
One of the most common sources of misunderstanding 
is our frequent inability to see another’s point of view. 
Sometimes we are unwilling to consider any other besides 
our own view of a question, but more often it is our ina- 
bility which forms the preventive cause. In this manner 
it happens that to the average layman the task of a teacher 
is something akin to the activities in which he indulges on 
a holiday trip. Teaching is characterized as work of a 
non-strenuous type, having short working hours, little 
needed preparation, and the like. 
To the teacher other occupations may appear to have 
many advantages. If those advantages outweigh the ad- 
vantages of teaching for an individual, then by all means 
that individual should not undertake to become a teacher. 
Coincident to seeing the advantages of other professions 
and occupations, it seems that we tend to magnify the dis- 
advantages of our own work. That is manifestly unfair 
to ourselves, to our work, and to the activities: of others. 
Obviously what we should do is to compare advantage 
with advantage and disadvantage with disadvantage. If 
that procedure is carefully followed, we are much more 
likely to be satisfied with our own occupation. Satisfac- 
tion in our chosen work should in no way imply content- 
ment in what we are accomplishing nor in the way-station 
33
-P-A-G-E-48
34 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
we are at that moment occupying. The newly appointed 
manager of a large commercial company, in addressing the 
heads of departments, notified them that he wanted at once 
the resignation of any one who was completely satisfied 
with his present position, and the present accomplishments 
of his department. Doubtless everyone, regardless of his 
particular work, at one time or another, wishes he had 
selected some other life work. The real danger lies in the 
possibility of one’s thinking that so often and over so long 
a period that he does become hopelessly dissatisfied under 
the existing conditions. In such an event his efficiency, 
possible or real, is bound to be greatly impaired. We need 
to select our vocation with great care, but once having 
committed ourselves, our entire energies should be directed 
toward maximum accomplishment. 
While a course such as this has guidance elements, that 
function is largely limited to intra-professional activities. 
That is, as a result of study, observation, and discussion, 
each student should be better enabled to make a selection 
among the various courses offered by teacher training 
schools. But with reference to the question of whether 
one should teach school, become some type of a legal attor- 
ney, do hair-dressing, or mix sodas is a problem of guid- 
ance which in the main should be settled for each indi- 
vidual before he enters upon a period of specific prepa- 
ration. 
We know that the law of chance operates in the choice 
of a vocation, and chance coupled with what we term force 
of circumstances often guides prospective teachers. After 
the student reaches the teachers college or normal school, 
we say the chances are even that he will do acceptable work 
and so most of the new entrants remain. The institution
-P-A-G-E-49
  OTHER OCCUPATIONS 35 
which prepares teachers as other agencies of education 
ought not to be willing to permit defects to remain uncor- 
rected, and therefore in such a course as this it seems 
justifiable to raise for those who need them some questions 
concerning other professions. Conditions vary somewhat 
as regional differences develop so that no attempt will be 
made in this chapter to present facts regarding various 
occupations. Indeed, only a few of those occupations more 
professional in character which attract large numbers of 
people into their ranks will be mentioned. The purpose 
is to state questions so that the student may more easily 
understand the methods of finding facts and to assist in 
the determination of the facts most helpful as elements of 
guidance in selecting a vocation.

How may the different phases of legal services be classi- 
fied? Which classification, say criminal, corporation law, 
land litigation, etc., is most attractive to you? Why? 
What are the present requirements for entrance into the 
profession of law? Besides a state bar examination, what

various types of lawyers? How many are entirely satisfied 
as a result of their clientéle? What are some of the out- 
standing disadvantages? Do lawyers in general benefit 
by a retirement system with pension attached? What can 
be said in favor of the profession of law in summing up 
the case?

preparation? Length of preparation? Cost of prepara- 
tion? What are the entrance requirements to our most 
highly respected medical schools? Does the beginning 
practitioner need equipment for his office, that is, drugs, 
instruments, etc.? How expensive is such equipment? 
What are the working hours of a physician? What is his 
average income? Contrast it with that of the most suc- 
cessful school teacher of your acquaintance. Does the 
physician or surgeon risk anything? What are some of 
the unpleasant features of medical practice? Has the 
physician the problem of bill collection? Is transporta- 
tion a problem? Is there a well developed code of ethics 
in the medical fraternity? Summarize the advantages and 
the disadvantages.

Nursing 
The questions applied to the medical profession apply 
almost equally well in considering the work of nursing. 
In addition, a few other questions might be asked. What 
are the duties of a registered nurse in hospital service? 
When employed in a private home may those duties be 
varied or multiplied? Is there a strict definition of fune- 
tions, generally known among either nurses or laymen? 
Are nurses sure of steady employment? What hazards 
and unpleasantness must they sometimes encounter? 
What special qualifications are required by the various 
aspects of nursing as a profession? Do you possess all 
the qualifications? 
Business 
What proportion of people engaged in various forms 
of business activities are owners? managers? salesmen ? 
office force? How many business failures are listed in 
a year? How many successes, so-called? Do business men 
deal with people or inanimate materials chiefly? How 
much routine work is there in the business occupation you 
favor most? In case there is little routine connected with 
the particular position you have in mind, is it possible to 
obtain such a position without a long period of preparation 
or experience, or both? What constitutes a business suc- 
cess to the ordinary man on the street? What is success 
in teaching? Are there well established principles of 
business ethics? In what respects should a successful man- 
ager differ from a bookkeeper, stenographer, typist, ac- 
countant, or auditor? If you were to enter business, what 
would you undertake? Where? Have you sufiicient credit 
or capital? Compare advantages and disadvantages.

selection of a military or naval career? What degree of 
distinction accompanies a soldier or sailor ? An army officer 
or naval officer? What are the relative opportunities for 
promotion? What individual freedom is possible? What 
are the various ranks of both army and navy, and what 
financial remuneration is attached thereto? What is the 
length of service (term of enlistment)? What are the 
mental qualifications and physical requirements for enlist- 
ment? What opportunities are afforded by the army or 
navy for travel? Are there no limitations to such an 
advantage? Has military prestige lessened during the 
last century ? Compare domestic life of the regular-service 
enlisted man or officer with that of a lawyer, physician, or 
teacher. Study the programs of scholastic and profes- 
sional activities as conducted at the United States Mili- 
tary Academy at West Point and at the United States 
Naval Academy at Annapolis. State the case for and 
against the army and the navy as means of furnishing a 
career. 
Engineering 
The word engineering in its professional sense has a 
variety of meanings. There are civil, mechanical, elec- 
trical, chemical, metallurgical, and mining engineers, with 
variations in addition. Each one merits special investiga- 
tion to the individual who aspires to “engineering” before 
a choice is made. The several engineering societies will 
gladly furnish information desired concerning their re- 
spective fields, and catalogs of the best schools of engineer- 
ing will supply some data from which a general opinion
-P-A-G-E-53
  OTHER OCCUPATIONS 39 
may be formed. Fiction is full of romantic tales of the 
erection of great bridges, the construction of mammoth 
dams, the tunneling projects through mountains and under 
rivers, the erection of the modern skyscraper, the achieve- 
ments in electrical and mechanical science, the creation of 
powerful explosives, and so on, all of which is in greater 
or less degree founded upon facts. The sum total presents 
a tremendously attractive picture, and rightly so. But for 
him who is faced with the task of selecting a vocation, 
is it not much more fair to appreciate in some measure the 
struggle, the disappointments, and the discouragements 
which accompany great achievement ? 
Art 
The four great divisions of art are music, painting, 
sculpture, and literature. There are many other worthy 
of the name, but these four with their multifarious rami- 
fications attract the largest number of professional work- 
ers. There is a mistaken notion, quite common, that an 
artist enjoys some God-given talent and that this never- 
failing gift supplies all that is necessary. It may be 
quite true that unusual native ability is essential, but the 
true artist must work unceasingly to perfect his particular 
technique. Until that is accomplished, and until he shows 
complete mastery in his special field, the world does not 
recognize him as an artist. And until that recognition 
comes, if the artist is dependent upon his art for the 
economic necessities of life, he suffers. In fact, there are 
many philanthropic organizations and individuals who help 
support the struggling artist if they discover him and if 
his pride will permit him to accept material assistance. 
The way of the successful artist is not easy. Real suc- 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  40 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
cess never just happens. But the rewards of true success, 
in teaching as in any other occupation, are worth striving 
for with all the ability one possesses. 
In thinking of other possible life activities the place 
of the tradesman, the craftsman, and the laborer should 
not be belittled. Many of us in professional life might 
find our proper niche in one of these fields, and the selec- 
tion when wisely made would bring credit to the chooser. 
All honorable occupations are important and those filling 
the various positions in life should be duly honored and 
rewarded. No lesson needs to be impressed more force- 
fully upon the boys and girls of modern times than that of 
the “dignity of labor,” regardless of its position on the 
scale of recognized valuable social service.

  CHAPTER IV 
QUALIFICATIONS OF A TEACHER 
The familiar quotations, “Know thyself” and “To thine 
own self be true,” never had greater force than when ap- 
plied to one contemplating entrance into a vocation. We 
are too well aware of the misfits in business, professional, 
and social life to deny the importance of a keen realization 
of the requirements and the desirable attributes in any 
vocation which, if possessed, indicate probable success, and, 
if lacking, spell disappointment, discouragement, failure, 
and unhappiness. Nowhere is this more true than in the 
profession of teaching because of the tremendous responsi- 
bilities assumed in directing the activities and influencing 
the thoughts of the children who in time will direct and 
influence others who in turn will direct and influence 
others, and so on ad infinitum. 
A farmer has a sick horse. Whom does he employ to 
help him save the horse, which may be a valuable asset 
to him in wresting from the land he tills the necessary 
sustenance for his family and himself? Does he send 
for the blacksmith, the harness-maker, the jobber in farm 
machinery, the pastor, the Latin‘ teacher, the postmaster ? 
The answer is obvious. He sends for the veterinarian or 
for some one who has the particular skill necessary to do, 
and to do well, the things that will save the horse. The 
farmer follows the same prprinle if any of his livestock 
2. aN iY

need attention, if his farm machinery needs repairing, 
if any members of his family need medical care—someone 
is called who has a thorough knowledge, a highly developed 
skill, and the ability to produce desired results. And so 
our whole social fabric is made possible by the activities 
of plumbers, bricklayers, carpenters, masons, plasterers, 
contractors, designers, milliners, dressmakers, electricians, 
engineers, lawyers, physicians, philosophers, and so on 
through the list, each with a specialized skill, an ability 
to do a certain part of the world’s work. The question 
then is submitted: “Has society any right to require of 
those who aspire to teach, as a professional activity, an 
understanding of education, its purposes, and in the light 
of this understanding to measure conscientiously their own 
known qualities, their inclinations, and their potential 
abilities# If the children in society count for as much as 
horses, cattle, hogs, sheep, poultry, houses, streets, clothes, 
line-fences, pyorrhea, or sore-throat, there is only one 
answer. But if we count these children as our most price- 
less possession—and no one can or will dispute it—then 
the answer is multifold in its emphasis. 
If there is to be a process of selection of teachers, it 
should begin before the children of the schools suffer the 
results of non-selection. It is not the -purpose of this 
study to frighten the student into some other field of 
activity. Rather it is to be desired that a critical attitude 
at this time be developed in the clear light of understand- 
ing of the responsibilities involved in the teaching pro- 
fqssion. A general analysis is hereby attempted as ‘merely 
siggestive of a more adequate discussion of teachers’ 
alifications. 
It must be remembered that there are various fields of 
\ 
Sy 
   
-P-A-G-E-58
  44 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
teaching, such as kindergarten, primary, intermediate, and 
upper elementary grades, the departmental teaching of the 
junior and senior high schools, vocational classes, schools 
for exceptional children, fine-arts teachers, etc. There 
seems to be no generally accepted standards yet expressed 
in the individual fields which sharply distinguish one from 
the other. There is, however, a general belief that there 
are differences. For example, it is thought that a kinder- 
garten teacher may possess qualities not necessary or even 
desirable in a teacher of printing, let us say, in a technical 
high school for boys. That there are such differences is 
admissible. But it can be maintained that all teachers 
should possess certain general characteristics. In view of 
a general analysis, then, the student may, together with 
his knowledge of actual conditions in the several fields, 
locate himself in one of the many important positions in 
the profession, or, conceivably, he may decide to find some 
other occupation. Countless numbers of worthwhile voca- 
tions await the candidates. Multitudes of excellent people 
have never considered teaching as a profession. So to him 
who decides to leave the profession because of a firm con- 
viction that he is better fitted to do something else better— 
all honor to his judgment. Because, as previously indi- 
cated, no misfit can do quite so much damage as a misfit 
in the teaching profession. 
For the purpose of convenience the following general 
classification has been composed of elements which may 
be considered as essential for the most part in teachérs’ 
qualifications:, (4) personal equipment, (2) technique, 
(8) ability as measured by pupil achievement. The fist 
is divided into six subheads as follows: (a) physical 
pearance, (b) mental outlook, (c) social attitude, 
Ai 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
  QUALIFICATIONS OF A TEACHER 45 
leadership, (¢) scholarship, (f) professional attitude. 
These may be considered as basic—as the foundation upon 
which all successful activities are dependent. The second, 
technique, is divided into four parts: (a) preparation, (b) 
instructional skill, (c) class management, (d) classroom 
administration. The abilities necessary for the practical 
measurement of the technique acquired may be considered 
as an essential part of a teacher’s qualifications. So the 
third, or ability as measured by pupil achievement, is 
added and considered under two subheads: (a) knowledge 
and skills, (b) ideals and attitudes. These really consti- 
tute the ultimate test of teaching ability. It seems wise to 
emphasize the power to bring about desirable pupil 
achievement as an extremely important part in our pro- 
fessional equipment. 
For purposes 6f clarification of this classification we 
may transfer our thoughts to a possible situation. A super- 
visory officer in the conscientious discharge of his profes- 
sional duties visits the various classrooms. To make the 
picture stand out more sharply we may assume that it is 
his first “official” call and that it is his main purpose to 
obtain a general view of his educational problems. He 
enters Room 211. His office records tell him that it con- 
tains an eighth grade. There are about thirty boys and 
girls here. The teacher has had a good academic and pro- 
fessional education and her experience places her beyond 
the category of “novice.’ Our supervisor has just left 
Room 210 in which there is another section of the eighth 
grade. There are found pupils of the same age as those 
in Room 211, and as many in number. The teacher’s 
training and experience, quantitatively at any rate, are 
comparable to that of the teacher in Room 211. The same

course of study and the same textbooks and works of refer- 
ence are in both rooms. In short, there seems to be, ac- 
cording to his office records, about the same general prob- 
lems with about the same type of equipment for their 
solution. But there is really little similarity to be found 
as he views the actual conditions. He is astounded by 
the differences of the two classes as he first enters Room 
211. Here he finds industry, a refining influence, and 
general happiness unlike anything he has yet discovered 
in this school. In fact, he is unable to recall any situation 
where the general atmosphere of the classroom quite equals 
this. But the contrast is most striking when he compares 
conditions here with those in Room 210. “Why is it?” 
he asks himself. There are certain outstanding elements 
such as light and ventilation which are immediately appar- 
ent. But certainly these criteria are too inadequate to 
explain the situation. He becomes so absorbed in the work 
of the group that he forgets an appointment previously 
made and only comes to a realization of other duties when 
the class leaves for home at the close of the school day, an 
hour and a half later. His professional interest is thor- 
oughly aroused and he visits those two rooms many times 
during the next six weeks to insure a safe diagnosis. In 
analyzing the situation his conclusions are formed by the 
following observations :   Personal Equipment 
Physical Appearance (Address).—Whenever he enters 
Room 211 Miss A. recognizes his presence by a friendly 
but inconspicuous greeting. It is inconspicuous in that 
it does not detract from the work at hand, yet which says 
to the pupils more plainly than words: “Here is another

    worker in our field who has come to help us.” He observes 
that she stands erectly, is physically well poised, is vigor- 
ous and enthusiastic, and that the pupils reflect these char- 
acteristics in their attack upon the problems before them. 
He remembers, now, their first meeting. He recalls the 
firm handshake, the clear steady gaze, the controlled musi- 
cal voice, and her general air of refinement. He recalls, 
too, that she was not conspicuous because of her attire. 
She is fashionably dressed, yet modestly so. The style of 
clothes worn is in keeping with existing modes but is not 
extreme. She is very neat—her hair is “arranged” taste- 
fully, her hands are well manicured, and she is not dis- 
guised by an over-application of cosmetics. In other words, 
this teacher displays evidence of culture and refinement in 
dress, in voice, and in manner. She possesses that in- 
valuable quality of good address to which all, young and 
old, so readily respond. 
Then he thinks of Miss X. in Room 210. Her hand- 
shake was cold and lifeless. Her greeting was indifferent, 
to say the least. Her finger nails were in “deep mourn- 
ing,” her hair worn in an extreme fashion. He remembers 
that once he had seen her slovenly dressed, at another time 
she appeared on the street in a costume that, regardless of 
the wearer, would provoke undesirable comment’as soon as 
she came into view. She was stooped and shifty in manner. 
Her voice was shrill and irritating. She seemed over- 
“anxious for closing time and decidedly exasperated by the 
presence of her professional visitor. “Just the type,” he 
concludes, “to arouse antagonism wherever she appears.” 
Leadership.—Miss A. is forceful without being domi- 
neering, self-reliant without being unpleasantly indepen- 
dent. stimulating. but not arousing disorganized enthu- ‘ 
A :
-P-A-G-E-62
48 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
siasm, resourceful but discriminating in choice of solutions 
to social problems, and lastly, just—mixing gentleness and 
firmness to a degree unconsciously commanding the affec- 
tion and respect of all. In short, she is a true leader in 
the sense that people like to work with her—not the type 
of leadership which says, “Follow me,” but rather that 
which seems to imply, “Come, let us work together,” to- 
ward a given end. 
Miss X., he reflects, is quite different. There is no 
foree of action or character in evidence. She depends 
upon the materials at hand to meet all exigencies and im- 
presses him as having surrendered completely to a world 
full of baffling, annoying, and useless problems. She dis- 
courages initiative by her every action and is continually 
at a loss to locate that which will contribute to a well- 
connected chain of ideas. The children feel that she is 
partial and that the less said about a difficulty the better, 
as explanations seem only to add to the misunderstanding. 
Scholarship —It has been said that in training and 
experience the two teachers seem to be nearly equal. Miss 
A. seems to be in complete mastery of her subject-matter; 
Miss X. is apparently ill at ease whenever any factual 
question is raised. Miss A. practices generally accepted 
educational theory; Miss X. seems to have been exposed 
to a variety of methods but inoculated by none. Miss A. 
has a generous fund of general information upon which 
she draws to a great advantage in class work and in-social 
circles ; Miss X. seems to have missed the important phases 
of life and is not at ease in the presence of, tefined intel- 
lectual people. Miss A. uses charming English, not stilted 
nor extravagant but expressive and pleasing; Miss X. 
makes inexcusable blunders in language.” Miss A, has 4 
iN  
-P-A-G-E-63
  QUALIFICATIONS OF A TEACHER 49 
every appearance of being thorough in her study and in- 
telligent in all efforts; Miss X. has apparently been chiefly 
concerned in “getting by,” which is a small fraction of a 
degree above complete failure. The contrast between the 
two from an intellectual standpoint is appalling. 
Mental Outlook.—These three attributes, physical ap- 
pearance, power of leadership, and scholarship may be ex- 
plained in part by their respective outlooks upon life in 
general. Miss A. is cheerful, sensibly optimistic, and has 
a sense_of humor-which-marks her as a real human-being 
and_a_veritable lady.) She seems to have mental poise 
Which is expressed in a dignity of bearing which never 
‘arouses criticism but always inspires respect. The most 
vulgar recognize in her a true womanliness which compels 
their admiration, wonder, and reverence. She adapts her- 
self to new situations with great facility and is very sus- 
ceptible to instruction designed to be helpful. Her actions 
reflect her high ideals and general mental activity. And 
her unquestioned sincerity, so unconsciously displayed, 
marks her as one always to be entrusted with grave re- 
sponsibilities. Her mental attitude seems to have deter- 
mined entirely her daily activities connected with all 
phases of her life. 
What was said in the last statement concerning Miss A. 
may be said with equal force when applied to Miss X. 
But with what different results! She seems distrustful of 
humanity as a whole and as individuals. She regards 
every one as an enemy until proof to the contrary is pro- 
duced and then she is inclined to reject the proof. Her 
sense of humor seems to be almost depraved. She laughs 
loudly and long at silly or vulgar jokes and misses the 
point entirely in an expression of true wit. To her the
-P-A-G-E-64
  50 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
term dignity is anathema. She fails repeatedly to see 
another’s point of view if it differs from her own and 
learns only when the force of circumstances compels. One 
fails to detect in her speech and action any outstanding 
worthy ideals and to all appearances she is superficial in 
the sense that the term is opposed to sincerity. What 
wonder that the room is in a high state of disorder! 
Social Attitude.—Inevitably there is further diversity 
in these two people by reason of their widely differing men- 
tal attitudes. The one is always friendly, courteous, and 
tactful ; the other, indifferent and many times disagreeable. 
One is pleasantly and effectively aggressive with pupils, 
colleagues, and social associates; the other, passive if not 
negative in all her human relationships. The one conforms 
to the most acceptable social standards; the other fre- 
quently disregards the opinions of the community. One 
has consecrated her life to the service of humanity; the 
other is selfishly individualistic. Briefly, one is a highly 
cultured, socialized force for refinement in its best sense, 
and the other a neutralized potentiality, creating discon- 
tent instead of increasing genuine happiness. 
Professional Attitude—We may profitably inquire 
about the effect of such dissimilar mental perspectives 
upon professional attitudes. It is not difficult to visualize 
Miss A. in her professional relationships as conscientious, 
willing, reliable, accurate, and punctual. She codperates 
with her colleagues to the fullest extent in the promulga- 
tion of the common purposes. She is eager to grow pro- 
fessionally and thereby contributes materially to the real- 
ization of a higher professional standard and to the creation 
of increasingly higher professional ideals. This attitude 
is clearly reflected in her persistent interest in the physical,  
-P-A-G-E-65
  QUALIFICATIONS OF A TEACHER 51 
moral, and intellectual welfare of her pupils. Miss X. is 
disinterested in all of these aspects of professional activity. 
Technique 
Preparation.—Our supervisor next carefully scrutinizes 
the technique of these sharply contrasting teachers. Miss 
A. displays an astute understanding of objectives. Her 
work not only reflects intelligent planning for long periods 
of future activity but reveals a discriminatory selection 
of materials to be used and an excellent organization of 
such material chosen. Her plans unfold carefully con- 
sidered assignments. Her preparation is a product of a 
high type of intelligence. Miss X. permits each day to be 
“sufficient unto itself.” If any one doubts the value of 
intelligent preparation, the chapter dealing with the pur- 
poses of education should be clarifying. 
Instructional Skill—Under this phase of technique 
Miss A. displays a thorough knowledge of the individual 
differences of children. Miss X., if she gives the matter 
any attention at all, acts upon the old conception of im- 
partiality and treats the pupils all alike. Miss A. is so 
specific in her problem solving that the supervisor can 
grasp, without a detailed lesson plan before him, the 
central thought toward which the class is being directed. 
Miss X. merely allows the class period to be filled by any 
rambling discussions about the school subject scheduled 
for that hour and accomplishes practically nothing helpful. 
Miss A.,.by reason of her knowledge of the subject and her 
well-formulated plan of attack, is able to stimulate thought- 
ful responses. The pupils have a problem to solve which 
does not permit guessing but requires them to reflect be- 
fore offering a solution or contributing to the discussion.  
-P-A-G-E-66
  52 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
Her questioning is skillfully done. When drill is required 
she questions in accordance with the existing need; when 
she wishes to test their grasp of facts or to direct reflection 
the question is the instrument with which she intelligently 
operates. She thoroughly understands the values of purely 
drill work and appreciation lessons, of developmental study 
and reviews, of inductive and deductive methods, of 
projects, problems, cases, ete., and her whole program of 
procedure reveals a proper balance of the values of various 
types of methods to be employed. 
Class Management.—What is the result of this highly 
developed technique? As was so clearly discernible to 
the supervisor upon his first visit to Miss A.’s classroom 
there is a marvelously developed spirit of orderliness. The 
pupils are happy in their work because they are interested 
in the problems to be solved and in codperating whole- 
heartedly in all activity. They esteem Miss A. for what 
she is and respect hér for what she can do. She is alive 
to their joys and disappointments, is always willing to 
help them after they have done their part to help them- 
selves, is businesslike in her relation with them in all 
routine procedure, but is, after all, the “Big Sister” with 
whom they delight to work and play and for whom they 
would fight loyally. These qualities in the teacher make 
for that which we often call discipline but which in this 
classification is termed class management. 
What does he find in Room 210? By this time we 
prefer to study Miss A. as a type. Miss X. has long 
since lost our active interest. But she still exists, and the 
children are very much alive. Our supervisor discovers 
here the precise antithesis of orderliness. The pupils are 
frequently discourteous, are interested in what happened
-P-A-G-E-67

QUALIFICATIONS OF A TEACHER 53 
on the way to school, at intermission, or in what may 
transpire that evening. They whisper or talk in under- 
tones about whatever occupies their attention. They crowd 
each other out of seats, place bent pins to the discomfort 
of some unfortunate pupil, to their high glee and to the 
despair of the teacher. In fact, anything “goes” but con- 
centration and keen interest in the school work. They 
have no respect nor esteem for Miss X. They are learn- 
ing as surely as any one ever learned anything to “get by” 
with as little effort as possible, and a type of citizenry 
is thus being formed that will stand as an almost insuper- | 
able obstacle to all progress, industrial, political, religious, 
and social. 
Classroom Administration.—The supervisor sees at the 
beginning the more obvious classroom conditions. In one 
room heating, lighting, and ventilation are conducive to 
the health of all and the best work. In the other is 
found a close, stuffy atmosphere and no adjustment of 
shades to meet the changing conditions of weather or 
natural changes of light. In the one, the working tools 
of the schoolroom, such as textbooks, works of reference, 
supplies, etc., are in orderly avrangement and are well 
preserved. In the other, no regard for property values is 
cultivated or apparent. Miss A. has the pupils seated 
according to their individual physiological needs. Miss X. 
allows them to keep the desks they selected at the opening 
of the session when a general rush was staged early in 
the morning for the “choice locations.” Miss 11. keeps 
her records complete and adequate and the necessary writ- 
ten reports are done neatly and promptly. Mids X. con- 
siders records and reports a drudgery and only attends as 
little as possible to each, and then only when actually

54 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
forced to meet the requirements. In the one room the 
routine essential to group activity transpires with a mini- 
mum of confusion and an optimum of success. In the 
other, such matters operate contrariwise—a maximum of 
confusion and a minimum of efficiency. This is being 
consistent. 
Ability as Measured by Pupil Achievement 
Knowledge and Skills —As a final test in school tech- 
nique our supervisor attempts to measure results. He 
applies in codperation with the teacher various achieve- 
ment tests, both standardized and otherwise. In the one 
case the records of the pupils cause a sense of pride in 
worthy accomplishment to prevail, the happy effect of 
which is largely nullified when the results are compared 
to those of the other group. Their language expresses 
the refining influence of education, while the coarse ver- 
nacular of the streets still prevails in Room 210. They 
are not only more able to think reflectively but, as a com- 
panion. trait, they amaze him in their power of oral and 
written expression. They have habituated themselves in 
more effective methods of study. To summarize, their 
knowledge has appreciably increased and their skills have 
been multiplied both in number and quality. 
ideals and Attitudes—They (the pupils in Room 211) 
exhibit the invaluable asset of self-control. They recog- 
nize the rights of others. They respect law and order as 
fundampntal in group activity. The baser self is re- 
strained and in its place towers that broader and better 
self whic takes into account the extent of relationships 
/with.other human beings. He inquires about their activi- 
ties outside of school hours and finds them actively inter- 
. \

ested in Boy Scout, Girl Scout, or Camp Fire Girl 
organizations, with worthwhile cinemas, musicals, literary 
clubs, athletic clubs, ete., and, much to his delight, not 
for their own selfish ends primarily, but for what they 
may be enabled thereby to contribute to the general prog- 
ress of community, state, and national life. He finds a 
fundamental respect for the right, a well-deyeloped power 
of discrimination between the valuable in life and the 
useless, and, better still, the determination to live day by 
day these ideals which are now their own. As they go 
here and there, discussion more and more centers about 
the beautiful in life. What an addition to the city are 
its well-preserved trees and public parks! How Rach- 
maninofi’s “Prelude” stirs their spiritual self and how con- 
trasting is the effect of modern “jazz!” They appreciate 
art in its various forms—paintings, literature, architec- 
ture—not as abstractions but applied to actual contacts in 
life as it really is to them day by day. And then, as it 
were, a climax in the story, he sees in them a desire, an 
effort to understand others and their problems and to help 
others. The park policeman no longer finds it necessary to 
enforce the restrictions upon them because, in their appre- 
ciation of the park problems, they consciously codperate 
with the park commission. Apple cores, banana peels, 
waste paper, etc., are put in the receptacles placed by the 
health authorities for the convenience and protection of all. 
They are glad to codperate because it is now to them an act 
of reciprocity. The street cleaner does not suffer the in- 
dignity of taunts, stones, and snowballs. Quite to the 
contrary, they recognize his contribution to existing so- 
ciety. This is a new world, thinks our supervisor, and 
in the rejoicing, teaching becomes the profession of pro-

fessions. It is contributing to a new citizenry, a different | 
order of affairs, improved relationships, a better world 
in which to live and serve. And as he thinks of this 
new world, he does not forget the power of the teacher 
in Room 211 and her kind. | 
The writer wishes to state that Miss A. is to him a real 
character. He could take the reader to that teacher and 
her wonderful work. To such heights all teachers should 
aspire. He has seen many more who approximate her 
ability but none who quite equalled her tremendous in- 
fluence. Miss X., fortunately, he has never met. Suchi 
lack of strength probably exists, but scarcely in a single 
individual. The contrast is sufficiently pronounced to 
magnify and deservedly glorify the possible heights to 
which all members of the profession should strive to reach, 
and, it is hoped, sufficiently emphatic to point out the 
dangers to be avoided in our earnest pursuit of a common 
end—the enrichment and vitalization of the social heritage. 
The form of a student-teacher rating card reproduced. 
on pages 56 and 57 has been found useful for both student- 
teachers and supervisors. As used here it may serve as a 
summary of the discussion of the qualifications of teachers.

CHAPTER V 
A GENERAL ANALYSIS OF TEACHING 
The lives of human beings as depicted in fiction, in 
drama, and in biography become more appealing in pro- 
portion to the frequency and intensity of crises. The 
more dramatic the situation the greater is the interest. 
A youth, through discouragement, perplexity, and danger, 
stands alone, far from sympathy or help and faces the 
fork of the road. One way leads to fame, fortune, or 
personal satisfaction in humble achievement and honest 
endeavor; the other, to destruction, disaster, or a multi- 
-plicity of disappointments. He is unable to read the sign- 
boards; time presses; he cannot retrace his course; a 
choice must be made. But how, and what will be the 
outcome? It is at such a point in the story that our in- 
terest is highest. We subscribe to story magazines, buy 
books, attend the theater; in short, spend our time, money, 
and energy in order to find such life situations. Little 
do we realize that often near at hand can be found the 
material for the most intriguing plot. 
It is conceivable that, at the end of that period of 
scholastic training commonly known as secondary educa- 
tion, such a critical decision must be made. The dramatic 
force may be lost but the importance of the choice is not 
diminished. Assuming that, for those who contemplate 
membership in the great profession of teaching, convic- 
61
-P-A-G-E-76

62 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
tions are lacking or that reinforcement of opinion is neces- 
sary, it may be desirable early in a survey and guidance 
course to consider carefully some aspects of teaching. No 
greater tragedy is imaginable than the wrong selection 
of a vocation. Not only is the life of the individual af- 
fected, but by almost unescapable inefficiency the ultimate 
welfare of many others is often involved. If teaching is 
to become a profession in its truest sense, those who enlist 
in its ranks must appreciate its many problems and liter- 
ally consecrate their lives to the realization of its high 
purposes and the perpetuation of its fundamental prin- 
ciples.   
Teaching as an Art 
“Education is a science but teaching is an art.” Quot- 
ing Bagley, “we may say that teaching is, indeed, a fine 
art.” One of the first principles to be learned is the im- 
portance of the definition of terminology. For purposes 
of contrast science may be considered as classified knowl- 
edge, a resultant of controlled, systematic, and carefully 
tested experimentation. Art is the application of this 
body of knowledge in effecting a desired end. A fine art 
may be conceived, additionally, as “the application of 
skill and. taste to production according to esthetic prin- 
ciples.” 
Education as a science will be discussed in some detail 
in a subsequent chapter. Teaching as an art challenges 
the finest in human character. The creations of the 
painter, the sculptor, the musician, the literary genius 
have long claimed our attention and commanded our ad- 
miration and reverence. To what are our acknowledg- 
ments attributable? Undoubtedly the skill of the artist

is a factor.. This, however, must have its roots in a sub- 
stantial groundwork of knowledge. Then the imagination 
must project the fabrication of elemental units into a 
world of creation. And finally recognition of art must 
rest upon the power of interpretation. 
In all this the artist must be lost in his art. Once a 
reader was interpreting the closing scenes of a great drama. 
As the power of the message swayed that vast audience a 
breathless hush prevailed. When the reader had finished 
not a stir was perceptible. He left the platform without 
the vociferous applause usually accorded popular publie 
entertainers. Yet no greater acclamation was possible. 
He was an artist. He, the individual, was completely lost 
in his subject. 
So it should be with one who aspires to guide youth. A 
fundamental knowledge of content based upon a clear 
recognition of purposes, an acquired skill in handling ma- 
terials, anticipation of the child’s future needs and prob- 
lems, and the ability to interpret life—these mark the 
possibilities of teaching as a fine art. To omit the last 
of these criteria is to classify the teacher as a craftsman, 
worthy without doubt, but incapable of new creation. No 
clearer conception of objectives, no greater need for ele- 
mental facts and principles, no finer technique, no keener 
vision, no more insistent demand for interpretation is re- 
quired than from one who works with childhood, the most 
precious of all invaluable material. 
While our respect remains for the craftsman, and while 
we must recognize the significance of his contribution to 
society, the ideal of art as a fundamental conception of 
teaching may well provide the stimulus for a more rapid 
development of a truly great professional consciousness.

64 | AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
Teaching as Directing Growth 
Recognizing the significance of the teacher as an artist — 
is not without its attendant dangers. It must not be for- 
gotten that the child as a fundamental factor in society 
must receive due emphasis in the teaching process. A 
plant, as it is nurtured, is exposed to proper climatic con- 
ditions, is pruned, is supplied with water and sunshine— 
in fact, is given the most careful attention. The result is a 
thing-of beauty, not infrequently a work of art with Na- 
ture, aided by man’s genius, as the artist. A child is 
born needing even greater care because he is physically 
more complex and therefore subject to more diversified 
attacks than the plant while in his helplessness he is unable 
in many cases to withstand them alone. Nevertheless, his 
being develops rapidly and, unlike the plant, he learns to 
do certain things and to refrain from doing other things 
resulting, or tending to result, in a feeling of satisfying- 
ness. In due course of time, again unlike the plant, the 
child begins to recognize certain elements in his environ- 
ment, particularly other human beings, and begins to dis- 
play an ability to discriminate. The interesting and amaz- 
ing feature (from the standpoint of comparison with plant 
life and with animal life lower in the scale than humans) 
is the parallel development of his physical being and his 
power of intellectual growth. There comes a time, in his 
post-adolescent period of life, when physical and anatomi- 
cal growth (not change) ceases and psychological experi- 
mentation leads us to believe that intellectual capacity 
reaches its maximum about the same time. It is not to 
be inferred that the individual cannot learn beyond this 
point in his growth but only that his mental capacity 
probably does not change materially after that time.
-P-A-G-E-79
  A GENERAL ANALYSIS OF TEACHING 65 
It is fairly clear from the physiological standpoint that 
the child’s growth is uneven, that is to say, for example, 
that physical and anatomical development is rapid from 
birth to the age of seven or eight, and that for three or 
four years following growth is less rapid. This period 
is followed by one of greater acceleration, in turn followed 
by one of slower development. This continues in varying 
degree until physical and anatomical maturity is reached. 
The same opinion has been held concerning mental growth, 
but recent investigations tend to confirm the belief that, 
in general, this side of a child’s development is more uni- 
form. This theory has a direct bearing upon the problems 
of education with respect to subject-matter and approach 
to method. 
To see a stately oak grow from a tiny acorn excites our 
wonder. Even greater in its effect upon us must be the 
study of the development of a child from the fertilization 
of the ovum to the fully developed adult. The primary 
consideration in education is the child’s intellectual, social, 
moral, and spiritual growth about which much remains to 
be learned. However, many mental traits are observable 
which distinguish man from other animals. We do know 
that man is highly social, that he helps formulate moral 
codes, and that he constructs for himself and for others 
an intangible something which for lack of better terms 
may be called a spiritual self. These qualities indicate 
his superiority in this world of plant and animal life and 
merit the careful study of all who engage primarily in 
educational activities. 
Man, as a species, is strangely dependent. Plant life, 
and nearly all forms of animal life, flourish abundantly 
without the advantages and careful nurture accorded
-P-A-G-E-80
  66 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
human beings. This very dependency, so pronounced in 
infancy, has led the child gradually but certainly to con- 
sider others and to suffer if, reciprocally, he is not con- 
sidered by his kind. Hence, institutions such as the 
tribe, the family, the home, the community, etc., have 
developed. And as discovery and invention made changes, 
so has society as a whole grown to its present proportions. 
In another chapter the nature of society will be treated 
more fully. The point of emphasis here is that we must 
concern ourselves as teachers with growth as processes of 
development for both society as a whole and for the indi- 
vidual. Which of the two we shall consider as of primary 
importance will to an appreciable degree affect our policies 
of education. 
Teaching as Related to the Past 
There are those who assert their interest in the present 
and future, who stoutly maintain that they do not live in 
the past. At the other extreme are those who place so 
much emphasis upon what has happened that it appears 
that to them the present and future are inconsequential. 
What can the past contribute to the present and future? 
The study of human progress creates in the student a 
time sense and a consciousness of spatial relationships. To 
realize proper proportions of time and space is to provide 
a broader point of view in dealing with present enterprises 
which may reach far into the future and touch far distant 
points. An adequate sense of proportion tends to lead to a 
balance of thought which should result in saner methods of 
attack upon all problems. As an illustration consider the 
social problem. Without reference to the past we may 
easily become embittered and cynical because social re- 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
  A GENERAL ANALYSIS OF TEACHING 67 
form does not progress as rapidly nor spread as far as 
we, its enthusiastic proponents, may desire. But if we 
consult history it appears that social evolution for ages 
was practically dormant. Then came the invention of 
writing and, later, printing. At once distances were dimin- 
ished; advancement, socially, became more rapid. Then 
the introduction of steam and electricity in a utilitarian 
way brought people still closer together. Transportation 
and communication were greatly facilitated. Radio bids 
fair to enhance our social solidarity. But humanity as a 
whole moves slowly, especially along social lines. The 
results of this perspective of the past are greater patience 
and keener insight into the possibilities of the present and 
future. 
Then, too, an understanding of the causes and results 
of great movements broadens the foundations upon which 
judgments must be formed. Our appreciation of religion 
and politics, for example, would be seriously impaired 
were it not for an exact knowledge of the various evolu- 
tionary and revolutionary periods in their respective fields. 
Our American principle of complete separation of church 
and state is but a bit of dogma without the facts concern- 
ing past religious and political relationships. Upon de- 
liberation in the light of such knowledge growing out of 
the past we are unable to reach unbiased convictions. 
If we contemplate a child separated at birth from all 
human association and even simple forms of civilization 
and assume that he would survive physically, what would 
we imagine concerning his future? In general, animals 
act in new situations instinctively. In only a few cases 
have data been secured which indicate that animals teach 
each other. This child, then, could not rely upon instruc-   
-P-A-G-E-82
  68 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
tion from animals. Indeed, he would become, for all 
practical considerations, a primitive being, and if he and 
his progeny were to be so isolated continuously the picture 
reveals a group of primitive human beings struggling 
through the ages toward the point now realized and en- 
joyed by modern civilized peoples. Such a dismal result 
is impossible, (1) because humanity can teach its kind 
and other kinds to a limited extent, and (2) because the 
rich experiences of the past in this process of teaching 
become real and function in the daily activities of all. 
Thus as experience accumulates and improvement is real- 
ized, each succeeding generation, theoretically and prac- 
tically, begins farther along the line of progress than did 
its immediate forebears. This is the hope of education, 
and it is because of this transmission of vicarious experi- 
ence that teaching is defied to disregard the past. 
The Present and the Teaching Problem 
Present situations as a point of departure are held by 
many to overshadow the past in importance. It is not 
the purpose of this course to attempt to settle the con- 
troversy but rather to indicate the motivating, vitalizing 
force of the present in teaching. The child hears the terms 
community, state, and nation and because of their present 
existence and by reason of his natural tendencies inquiries 
are forthcoming concerning the nature of these institu- 
tions. It is at such a point that the teacher can by skillful 
manipulation of materials and facts as outgrowths of the 
past direct the comprehensive appreciation of such forms 
of the social heritage. Unquestionably by reason of this 
developed attitude the child will be a more valuable unit 
in his community, state, and nation.
-P-A-G-E-83
  
A GENERAL ANALYSIS OF TEACHING 69 
When less abstract problems arise such as taxation, 
transportation, communication, invention, immigration, 
gubernatorial and presidential elections, tariff, industrial 
disputes, religious bigotry or fanaticism, public education, 
ete., the appreciations of existing institutions and organiza- 
tions designed to help solve such problems coupled with a 
sympathetic understanding of all sides of the various 
problems predicate intelligent participation in the solu- 
tion of such questions. 
It is clearly in this connection that the past and present 
are found to be inseparable. And the crying need of the 
day is for judgments formed upon liberality and fairness 
to the complete exclusion of prejudice, undesirable tradi- 
tion, and ignorance. Upon whom does this responsibility 
rest more clearly or happily than upon the teacher? 
The Future and Education 
The past, with its thrilling tales of adventure, its com- 
manding historical characters, its astounding development, 
its marvelous achievements, and its significant contribu- 
tions to the present dares not command our entire attention 
as teachers and learners. The present, as engrossing and 
attractive as it is, must also permit other considerations 
in the educative process—a discriminating and prophetic 
view, based upon facts and principles, of the future trend 
of events. For instance, the history of the human race 
produces evidence which justifies us, almost without ex- 
ception, to predict a chaotic and frantic world if religious 
influence were to become neutralized. Religion has been 
a fundamental factor in human history throughout the cen- 
turies. So teachers aid in the perpetuation of great re- 
ligious principles for the sake of future generations. 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
  70 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
Social, political, and economic conditions can be predicted 
in varying degree with equal certainty. It has been those 
with knowledge of the past, understanding of the present, 
and insight into the future who have been known as the 
wise men, the truly great men of history. 
Teaching, in addition to encouraging such an attitude 
toward the future, cannot avoid still another obligation. 
To a certain extent conditions can be controlled so that 
future realization of purposes becomes not only possible 
but probable. In education an outstanding example of 
the power of teaching is found in an examination of the 
Prussian schools before the World War. Instruction was 
so controlled in 1914 when the call to arms came that the 
whole Empire responded for “God and Fatherland.” 
There was unanimity of purpose, and everything was 
staked upon the outcome of the conflict about to ensue. 
This illustrates the dangers to be avoided in the exercise 
of such power. It is conceivable, however, that, by a 
united effort of the 700,000 public school teachers of our 
country, in a generation great inroads could be made upon 
prejudice, racial hatreds, religious bigotry, social inequali- 
ties, disregard for facts, contempt for calm deliberation, 
ete. Imagine the possible results! The tremendous prob- 
lems of modern complex civilization, approached by the 
great majority without bias, fear, andiignorance, but with 
sympathetic understanding, with intelligent application of 
facts, with consideration for all aspects of the situation, 
with a new type of intelligent activity! Such beneficent 
control lies within the grasp of the teachers of childhood 
throughout the world. What is needed is the fearlessness 
of a Hannibal, the directing genius of a Napoleon, the 
determination of a Washington, the calm convictions of
-P-A-G-E-85
  
CE eee eg Te re ee 
A GENERAL ANALYSIS OF TEACHING 71 
a Lincoln, the aggressive courage of a Roosevelt, and unity. 
The exact antithesis of such a picture is fatalism. 
“What is to be will be in spite of all I can do,” says the 
fatalist. The urging force of anticipated achievement is 
gone wherever such doctrine prevails. It is not fatalism 
but its antithesis, progressivism, that has brought civiliza- 
tion to its present high status, and no one dares gainsay 
the potential power of the teacher in any program of 
worthy accomplishment. 
Development of Critical Thinking Habits 
Among the many problems of the teacher, it appears 
that an outstanding one is that of developing critical think- 
ing habits. Critical is used here in the sense of meaning 
analysis, reflection, and judgment in a given situation. 
It cannot be easily refuted that this type of activity, 
namely critical thinking, is the most strenuous of all 
human behavior. Perhaps this explains the prevailing 
lack of it among people in general. In any event the ex- 
planation scarcely justifies the condition. Analysis means 
breaking the whole into its component parts. In other 
words, analysis means a thorough understanding of rela- 
tionships. Upon the possession of sufficient data the rela- 
tionships are weighed one against another. This is reflec- 
tion. And’ this evaluation of data forms the basis for 
judgment. Such a procedure in problematical situations 
should become habitual. In the opinion of every educator 
consulted the teachers are the logical agents to realize such 
an aim. What the results would be is not to be anticipated 
from the standpoint of speculation. Certainly among the 
desired results could be listed (1) the questioning of wide 
generalizations so prevalent at the present time, (2) a
-P-A-G-E-86
    72 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
lessening tendency to take too much for granted, (3) a 
scientific attitude toward all problems, new and old, (4) a 
more thorough knowledge of current conditions, and (5) 
an increasing assurance of more equitable settlement of 
controversial problems. The day has passed when we 
can expect a formal subject-matter course effectively to 
promote reasoning power. To state the same problem in 
another way, we may say that critical thinking can 
scarcely become a fixed entity as a result of arbitrarily 
placing somewhere in an educational program the subject 
of logic, as an example. On the contrary, right thinking 
habits may be effectively developed by skillful guidance 
from the very beginning of the learning process. This 
cannot be realized immediately, for to be consistent we 
must admit the need for increasingly more adequate think- 
ing habits on the part of the teacher. It is here as a 
group we have, in developing critical thinking as an 
habitual activity, a very keen responsibility. It is only 
through such an ability that our aims of teaching may be 
completely realized. 
Appreciations 
The psychologist might seriously question a discussion 
of the cultivation of appreciations as an objective in teach- 
ing because of the intangible meanings of the term. Just 
what appreciations are we are unable to state in precise 
language. Yet no one will deny that children can be 
taught to appreciate music, literature, water coloring, 
oil paintings, statuary, dramatic skill, fine workmanship, 
and a variety of such material forms. It is known, too, 
that the more abstract qualities of life such as kindness, 
fairness, beauty, virtue, honesty, and the like stimulate
-P-A-G-E-87
  A GENERAL ANALYSIS OF TEACHING 13 
appreciation. In fact, it seems that for a full enjoyment 
of life true appreciations are essential. 
In the first classification justification can be found in 
the fact that those who contribute most to life are those 
who do appreciate one or more of the items mentioned. It 
is the appreciation of the better things in art that keeps 
art bridled; it is the appreciation of superior craftsman- 
ship that encourages the artisan to better effort; it is the 
ability to appreciate properly that functions so well in 
the leisure hours which in this period of industrial prog- 
ress have been considerably lengthened. But what may be 
of even greater importance, if such were possible, is the 
appreciation of kindness, fairness, beauty, etc. By such 
means human relationships become more ideal. We un- 
derstand each other better because we understand motives 
and the conditions underlying these motives. In appreci- 
ating our interrelationships we enjoy a more ordered, co- 
operative, and efficient life. Once more the burden of 
responsibility rests upon the one directing the learning 
process. : 
Habits and Skills 
A general analysis of teaching must include specific 
skills as important outcomes. Skill is dependent upon’ 
habit, and habits are results of repetition. It must be 
obvious to all that certain skills must be attained in order 
that the individual may take his proper place as an active 
integral part of any progressive community. We have 
been reminded earlier in a general way of the significance 
of the invention of writing. Writing may be considered 
in two senses. It may refer to the art of expressing 
thought or it may mean merely penmanship. As either,
-P-A-G-E-88
  74 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
it involves a highly developed skill when fully realized. 
How important it is in the realization of a “socially 
efficient” person is difficult to determine. The conditions 
change with individuals, occupations, and places. There 
is little room for doubt, however, that in a nation of 
110,000,000 people intercommunication through writ- 
ing (newspapers, periodicals, magazines, ete.) is essential 
to progress. Hence the skill of writing needs attention ~ 
somewhere if only in a highly vocationalized curriculum. 
As for penmanship it may be safely said that legibility 
is probably the most that can be demanded and possibly 
more than can be defended since instance after instance 
can be shown of extremely successful careers from prac- 
tically every occupation of life in which the individual 
concerned could not “read his own writing.” It should 
be stated, parenthetically, that success in such cases came 
in spite of, not because of, poor penmanship. At least 
we may say that legibility in handwriting is highly desir- 
able. It remains, in any case, a skill of greater or less 
degree. 
Arithmetical processes, such as the four fundamentals; 
vocalization, either in the speaking or singing voice; play- 
ing a musical instrument; athletic activities, involving 
superior performance; typewriting, shorthand, bookkeep- 
ing, cost accounting, and auditing; diagnosis and surgery ; 
stage presence; oral and silent reading; critical thinking; 
all these and more illustrate skills of various types and 
degrees. In most cases cited the teacher is held responsible 
by the public and by the pupils or their parents for the 
successful development of the several skills which are ab- 
solutely essential for either a general or a specific life 
requirement.

Ideals and Attitudes 
Like appreciations, ideals and attitudes are elusive 
terms. If specific applications are made to everyday ac- 
tivities of human beings an understanding of both is 
possible. As the process of education is revealed it be- 
comes apparent that the child enters this life devoid of 
ideas. But as growth proceeds and situations arise ideas 
are formed. Ideas are based upon perceptions or are 
concepts founded upon percepts and imagination. As 
ideas develop the child begins to test them and then ensues 
the elimination or rejection of some and the growth or 
confirmation of others. Upon a basis of further experi- 
ences an ideal emerges. The idea has been elevated to a 
place of greater importance in the individual’s life—of 
greater importance because its potency has been materially 
augmented by reason of this transformation. To illustrate 
—a boy in his association with others like him on the 
playground or street obtains an idea through experience, 
imagination, or observation that a falsehood may be more 
productive of satisfaction to himself than a truth. By the 
same means he gains an idea that veracity is preferable 
or that discreet silence is the wisest course to pursue. By 
testing these ideas either imaginatively or actually let 
us assume that his conclusion is that truth is in the long 
run the best of the three. This becomes an ideal and the 
fact is that as soon as the ideal becomes firmly established 
it becomes virtually a rule of action. And in proportion 
to the strength of the conviction so will the child measure 
his daily actions because of his accepted principles. An 
ideal serves him as a guide in an immediate situation. 
Attitudes operate in a very real sense in the acceptance 
or rejection of new ideas or in the formation of ideals.

76 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
The reader can readily recall his attitude toward Latin 
upon entering high school. He had been told repeatedly 
that Latin was a difficult subject or that the instructor 
was very exacting. Whatever the cause he approached the 
problem in all probability with an unfavorable predispo- 
sition toward Latin. The results of such preformed 
opinion need no explanation. 
Imagine some one going to a new situation in a strange 
city. He is told that the business men are “up to date,” 
that the people are unusually friendly, that, in short, life 
there will be very pleasant. Again, the consequences need 
no elaboration. 
The point of emphasis is that attitudes, whatever they 
are or are not, are real and that they operate advan- 
tageously or otherwise with equal facility. It is also to 
be remembered definitely that attitudes can be created 
through the influence of teaching (what we teach and how 
we teach it) and because of the importance of attitudes in 
suecess or failure no school program can afford to disre- 
gard them. 
Summary 
No claim is made for a complete analysis of teaching. 
Some of its important problems are raised at this point 
in the course to stimulate further analysis and fo furnish 
the framework for a general view of the tremendous re- 
sponsibilities and opportunities of the teacher. The main 
theses considered are, in review: (1) the conception of 
teaching as a fine art; (2) education as growth and that 
teaching must take into account change which is universal ; 
(8) the obligation of educators to search the past with dis- 
criminatory judgment, in order (a) to understand great 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
  A GENERAL ANALYSIS OF TEACHING 77 
historical movements for their own sake, (b) to appreciate 
time and space in developments of importance, (c) to 
assist in interpreting the present; (4) the necessity for in- 
telligent codperation, in so far as limitations permit, in 
the solution of existing community, state, national, and 
world problems; (5) the projection of the related past and 
present into the related future to the end that progress 
in some measure may be consummated ; (6) the imperative 
demand for habitual critical thinking as a fundamental 
factor in social, religious, political, and economic develop- 
ment; (7) the importance of adequately developed power 
of appreciation of the more ennobling elements of life; (8) 
habits and skills as essentials in a well-rounded life de- 
velopment; and (9) the conception of ideals and attitudes 
as aims of education.

CHAPTER VI 
TYPES OF SCHOOLS 
Every intelligent teacher should have an appreciation 
of the whole scheme of education of which his own par- 
ticular work is a small although important part. The 
importance of his own work should not be disproportion- 
ately magnified. The wise teacher will see his work in its 
true relation to the whole of educational endeavor. Such 
educational literacy if widespread would result in greater 
unity of effort, more equitable demands for support, and 
a higher type of professional consciousness, 
Formal agencies for the promotion of education are 
both public and private. The public school is one main- 
tained by funds collected by a governmental taxing unit. 
The private school is maintained by registration and 
tuition fees and by gifts from private individuals or or- 
ganizations. The work of both public and private schools 
may be roughly classified into elementary, secondary, and 
collegiate levels. Before studying the different divisions 
and subdivisions of this classification it may be profitable 
to consider the problems of public and private educational 
agencies. 
Prejudices give direction to our thinking and too often 
determine to a large degree our conclusions. Some preju- 
dices predetermine our favor toward public education, 
others toward private education. Prejudicial thinking is 
81

| 82 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
| often the cause of fallacious statements regarding pur- 
poses, means, and outcomes of either public or private 
| education. The following illustrate what is altogether 
| too prevalent: “The private school teaches only one side 
| of a controversial subject.” “The public school presents 
all sides of a topic and permits the student entire freedom 
in reaching conclusions.” “The private school should be 
abolished.” “The public school is a Godless institution 
and is, therefore, responsible for the deterioration too 
evident in our social morality.” 
| Some Advantages of the Private School 
Private schools have been charged with existing for 
the sole purpose of spreading some particular propaganda. 
A closer examination than human beings are wont to give 
such statements reveals advantages as well as disadvan- 
tages. Since private schools are supported by private 
means it is maintained that the donor may dictate the 
exact nature of his particular hobby. It is conceivable 
and a reality that funds may be given by a philanthropic 
person to establish a school where experimentation in 
methods and materials can be conducted without interrup- 
tion. The donor may say, “Let this school be a laboratory 
in which any modern theory of education may be given 
fair and complete trial. Let us obtain the best profes- 
sional talent available and allow those selected to do this 
important work full power to initiate and conduct what- 
ever seems advisable to them.” That would be an advan- 
tage which the public school rarely enjoys. There is a 
limitation placed upon the public school’ by lack of funds 
even though the taxpayers are willing to permit unfettered 
intellectual effort on the part of the teachers. Education  
-P-A-G-E-97
    TYPES OF SCHOOLS 83 
owes the private school much for the strides which have 
been made. 
Some Disadvantages of the Private School 
Where creeds and special doctrines must be taught to 
the exclusion of all others it is manifestly wrong. The 
child learns only one angle of a situation under such con- 
ditions, and what is far more deplorable, the door is 
closed against all opposing thought. That is satisfactory 
from the viewpoint of the person or organization, but how 
can it ever hope to stand the test of thoroughly enlightened 
citizenship? Private schools sometimes suffer under the 
domination of narrow-minded sectarianism or denomina- 
tionalism, under the undemocratic load of assumed social 
superiority, and often under the deadening effects of selfish 
commercialism. 
What Are Rightly Called Private Schools? 
To the average taxpayer a private school is a church or 
parochial school or, less often perhaps, a school established 
and maintained by private means. Rarely do they add 
to this definition. Private schools of collegiate and uni- 
versity rank, of which there are scores, such as Columbia, 
Chicago, Syracuse, Georgetown, Harvard, Yale, Prince 
ton, and Cornell Universities, are not usually included. 
Trade schools and schools maintained by industrial con- 
cerns, denominational schools and colleges, many music 
and art schools, schools preparatory to college, and many 
correspondence schools whose advertisements plentifully 
appear in popular magazines—any of these are as strictly 
private as the parochial school or the tuition school owned 
and managed by Madame X over on Plutocrat Boulevard. 
The bigot, religious, social, political, or economic, sees
-P-A-G-E-98
84 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
only the particular type of private school which is most 
obnoxious to him in the light of his prejudices. The un- 
bridled enthusiast who thinks in terms of ideals and 
fails to distinguish between pure democracy and the kind 
‘of a democracy which is at present practicable, also con- 
demns in a wholesale way the private school and discounts 
all its creditable achievements by a wave of the hand. 
Such thinking is much too common. It is obviously 
vicious and represents that false reasoning earlier men- . 
tioned. 
Advantages of the Public School 
If one accepts the principle most prevalent in the 
United States that education is primarily a public fune- 
tion then it becomes a public trust. To execute such a 
trust public officials are chosen to represent the people 
who, as a whole, benefit from concerted effort in promot- 
ing education. The public school tends toward social and 
intellectual solidarity. The public school is cosmopolitan 
in character and offers an equal opportunity to all re- 
gardless of sex, color, or creed. Its support being estab- 
lished by constitutional provision or by legal enactment 
insures a relatively stable existence even though at times 
inadequate. 
Disadvantages of the Public School : 
As already indicated the public school often suffers 
because of inadequate financial support. Well meaning 
citizens ‘point to the tremendous increases in school costs 
during the last ten years failing to remember the dimin- 
ished purchasing value of the dollar or the parallel in- 
crease in costs in all other phases of economic life. The 
school budget is reduced, often a very short-sighted policy,
-P-A-G-E-99
ERE ke te Se eS SS ee ee, oe ee ee 
TYPES OF SCHOOLS 85 
with the result that a neighboring city attracts the best 
teachers, that there is a false economy in the purchase of 
school materials, that crowded school buildings become 
more crowded, ete. Occasionally the public school has a 
powerful enemy with strong political influence and the 
results are equally disastrous. 
The individual taxpayer little realizes the enormous 
amount and variety of demands made upon school authori- 
ties. Some meritorious organization appeals to the public 
school to give courses in thrift, in health education, in pub- 
lie sanitation, in city ordinances, in honesty, in constitu- 
tional history, in loyalty, in moral education, and so on 
ad infinitum. Usually these requests are made in the firm 
belief that the social structure will crumble and decay 
unless preventive measures (their measures!) are immedi- 
ately adopted. The public school authorities recognize 
the merits of these many claims but often find it a physical 
impossibility to accede to the wishes of all their constitu- 
ency. To do so would keep the educational program in a 
chaotic condition, and to fail to do so may offend. In 
either case it is the future generations which suffer most. 
In those places where the public has generously supported 
education by liberal tax rates, by creating boards of educa- 
tion with sufficient foresight and means to employ trust- 
worthy educational experts, who are entrusted with the 
obligations of public education—those communities have 
‘progressed socially, economically, and politically. Educa- 
tion pays if it is of the right kind, whether it be the 
result of public or private institutions. And since educa- 
tion does pay the public should increasingly assume the 
responsibility of promoting it as an effective means of 
realizing the ideals of seat society.

86 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
The Elementary School 
There are three subdivisions of the school dealing with 
elementary education: the special school, the kindergarten, 
and the school which attempts the work of the first six 
or the first eight grades. 
The special school is of comparatively recent origin, 
having developed as special schools during the last thirty 
years. The main function of these schools dealing with 
delinquents, mental and physical deficients, and retarded 
children, is to discover their possible abilities which are 
more or less neglected in the regular organization. Psy- 
chiatric treatment following psychological examination 
and the visiting-nurse activities often do more than the 
regular classroom teacher has either time or talent to ac- 
complish. Maladjustments are remedied, special treat- 
ment of individual cases takes place, the child is studied 
as an individual first rather than wholly as a member of 
the group, special abilities are discovered and developed, 
and the child is saved the embarrassment and annoyance 
of being “out of his element.” Due to the increased 
amount of individual attention required of the teacher the 
enrollment in special classes is usually limited to about 
fifteen. This calls for a specially trained teacher, a special 
type of room and equipment, and usually separation from 
the regular school is desirable, although on that point 
there seems to be quite a division of opinion. 
The Kindergarten.—This phase of school activity had 
its inception in the thinking of Friedrich Froebel, a Ger- 
man. In the United States the kindergarten is nearly 
seventy-five years old, the first one being established by a 
pupil of Froebel in Watertown, Wisconsin, in 1855.1 
+E. P. Cubberley, Public Education in the United States, p. 318.  
-P-A-G-E-101
    TYPES OF SCHOOLS 87 
The movement had gained great headway by the end 
of the nineteenth century and now there are thousands of 
public kindergartens, hundreds of private kindergartens, 
and numerous kindergarten departments in state normal 
schools and city training schools offering specialized 
courses for this phase of public-school education. 
The most obvious purposes of the kindergarten may be 
briefly summarized. One of the first lessons to be learned 
if one is to take his place successfully among his fellow 
beings is to learn to adjust himself to new conditions. In 
fact, adjustment is so important all through life that lack 
of ability to adjust one’s self to varying conditions is a 
very serious handicap both from the viewpoint of the in- 
dividual and of the group. The child of four years of life 
experience has had a comparatively sheltered existence. 
He has had only the members of his family, or, more prop- 
erly, the members of the home circle to which to make 
adjustments and, from the standpoint of group living, very 
often he has not been held very rigidly to that responsi- 
bility. The kindergarten attempts to help the child solve 
that problem through group enterprises such as games, 
projects, entertainment, and the like. Many a child enters 
the kindergarten with no regard for the rights of others 
nor inclination to make use of the abilities of others. He 
rarely leaves for the first grade work unless a marked 
change is noticeable. First grade teachers almost invari- 
ably testify that the kindergarten group is easily dis- 
tinguishable from the non-kindergarten children in the 
ability to make social adjustments. 
There are other elements which make the differences 
between children having kindergarten training and those 
not having such preliminary advantages. Among those of
-P-A-G-E-102
se 
88 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
greatest importance is the development of desirable atti- 
tude toward work and play. They appear to be able, for a 
time at least, to see more elements in a social situation 
and to give those elements more careful consideration. 
Their imaginative traits seem more highly developed and 
their judgment is more likely to depend upon actual cir- 
cumstances rather than upon mere speculation. Desir- 
able attitudes as an educational objective can by no means 
be confined to the kindergarten, yet if the elementary 
school, in its rather brief time of dealing with boys and 
girls, is to supply them with fundamental principles and 
tools whereby they may make their way more effectively, 
then any development of proper attitudes is that much 
time saved from the time needed by the elementary school. 
Hand in hand with desirable attitudes goes the forma- 
tion of good habits of work and play. Children in the 
kindergarten should be taught to observe the essential 
elements in any given situation and how thoughtfully to 
place them in their proper relationship to the condition 
needing attention. To begin right habits of thought, judg- 
ment, imagination, and the like, in the kindergarten is a 
distinct advantage to the elementary-school problem. 
A fourth objective of the kindergarten is to provide 
proper environmental conditions for self-expression. One 
might contend that no place could hope to compete with 
the home in that respect. The answer, of course, is that 
unbridled self-expression is entirely undesirable, and 
granting that the interest of the home is superior to that 
of the school the trained kindergarten teacher is quite 
likely to be a more careful student of the child and its 
needs than either the busy mother or the nurse. 
The summary need not be paradoxical to the careful
-P-A-G-E-103
  TYPES OF SCHOOLS 89 
student. To urge social adjustment, the development of 
proper attitudes toward work and play, self-expression, 
and the formation of desirable habits of work and play 
centered about improved ways of thinking is not neces- 
sarily accomplished at the expense of self-activity. Orig- 
inal nature needs directive forces to supplement its abili- 
ties. These forces operate in the kindergarten without 
interference, rather by enhancing the opportunities for 
self-expression. 
The Kindergarten Teacher. —Two tendencies seem to be 
especially desirable in the successful kindergarten teacher, 
one, the maternal attitude, and the other, the child-play 
trait. Whether they are native or acquired we shall for 
the moment leave to the psychologists. Both character- 
istics include sympathy, understanding, alertness, 
patience, persistence, and the ability, which is extremely 
rare, to see the world as the little kindergartener sees it. 
It is needless to urge a special type of preparation in 
children’s games, songs, stories, and the like, making cer- 
tain that the proper adaptation of means and material is 
realized. 
The Elementary School—In many respects the work 
of the kindergarten is continued in the grades of the ele- 
mentary school. Added to self-expression is the element 
of self-control and more strict observance of social laws. 
In many schools preparation for secondary-school work is 
stressed although in the main that aim of the elementary 
school has been superseded by the objective known as sup- 
plying the child with a working education. There is at 
the present time little agreement regarding what are the 
minimum essentials. In theory there seems to be a con- 
sensus of opinion that reading, writing, and computation 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
lS aE ee i ie aN ek gt Sa a mR a a car | 
90 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
are essential, but once an attempt is made to determine the 
kind and amount necessary, the disagreements become 
more obvious than the agreements. It is commonly held 
that high ideals, morals, ethics, appreciations, accuracy, 
thoroughness, good judgment, and the like are of equal 
importance to the so-called “tools” of life. Some believe 
that the elementary school should teach how to think and 
not so much what to think. Others contend that since one 
cannot think without something to think about that the 
content is of the greatest importance. What is needed, to 
keep the general theory, is the presentation of that in- 
formation and those skills which the great mass of hu- 
manity needs to survive in an ever increasingly complex 
society. The world needs not better citizens but more 
good ones, to paraphrase a well-known adage. Citizenship 
needs to be analyzed and then the elementary school will 
have something more definite toward which to direct its 
energies. 
The Secondary School 
Secondary education is far from being an American in- 
stitution in the sense that the movement was originated 
here. The growth of secondary education in America had 
its beginning in the Latin grammar school of the colonial 
period. As in the case of its immediate ancestor, the Latin 
grammar school in England, its curriculum was classical 
and its chief purpose was preparation for institutions of 
higher learning. 
The changes in industrial and social life during the sev- 
enteenth and eighteenth centuries led to a demand for 
more practical work in the schools, and the influence of 
these demands was responsible for the change in secondary
-P-A-G-E-105
  TYPES OF SCHOOLS 91 
institutions. This change was not the elimination of the 
classics but rather the addition of science subjects. The 
departure was of considerable significance and aroused a 
great amount of controversy. This new type of secondary 
school was known as the academy. The next step in the 
evolutionary process was the development of the present 
public high school, which was gradual. Nearly a half 
century had passed before the public high school was 
firmly established. This was accomplished in the last of 
the nineteenth century. 
It is of interest and of importance to note that sec- 
ondary education in the United States was sequentially 
arranged with respect to elementary education. That is, 
the high-school student did not begin his work until the 
completion of the elementary course of study. In most 
foreign countries there existed parallel systems of educa- 
tion between which the distinction was made on social, 
economic, and political differences. There was only a 
slight tendency here to follow that separation, and the 
distinction was soon eliminated. The public high school 
in this country is now recognized as an institution for all 
who are mentally qualified to do the work successfully. 
General aims of education which are discussed in a later 
chapter are “not incompatible with the cardinal principles 
of secondary education as outlined by a committee on the 
reorganization of secondary education, appointed by the 
National Education Association: “(1) health, (2) com- 
mand of fundamental processes, (3) worthy home-member- 
ship, (4) vocation, (5) civic education, (6) worthy use of 
leisure, (7) ethical character.” * Inglis has expressed the 
same general purposes in a threefold classification: 
? Department of Interior Bulletin, No. 35 (1918).

92 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
1. The preparation of the individual as a prospective citizen 
and codperating member of society—the social-civic aim. 
2. The preparation of the individual as a prospective worker 
and producer—the economic-vocational aim. 
8. The preparation of the individual for those activities 
which, while primarily involving individual action, the utiliza- 
tion of leisure, and the development of personality, are of 
greatest importance to society—the individualistic-avocational 
aim. * 
Attention is called to the functions of secondary educa- 
tion as discussed in the same book: 
(1) the adjustive or adaptive function 
(2) the integrating function 
(3) the differentiating function 
(4) the propedeutic function 
(5) the selective function 
(6) the diagnostic and directive function 
The secondary schools known as public schools have 
undergone an important subdivision. The new classifica- 
tion affects the organization dealing with elementary edu- 
cation as well as that concerned with higher education. 
Instead of the eight-four plan, which means eight years of 
elementary school work followed by four years of high 
school work, there has become quite prevalent that form 
of organization known as the six-three-three plan or the 
six-six plan. Under this scheme the purposes of the ele- 
mentary schools are to be realized in the first six grades 
and the other three years be given to what is commonly 
known as the Junior High School, comprised of grades 
seven, eight, and nine. This new type of school has cer- 
tain pretensions which characterize it as a distinctive type 
of school. In its codrdination with the senior high school,

TYPES OF SCHOOLS 93 
composed of grades ten, eleven, and twelve, the main 
objectives of secondary education still obtain. 
The Junior High School.—It is interesting to note the 
similarities and differences in the statements of aims of 
the various organizations contributing to secondary educa- 
tion. The junior high school, the senior high school, and 
the junior college, each makes its special claims. Thus for 
the junior high school, Briggs makes the following state- 
ment of purposes: * 
(1)... to continue, in so far as it may seem wise and pos- 
sible, and in a gradually decreasing degree, common, integrat- 
ing education. 
(2) ... to ascertain and reasonably to satisfy pupils’ im- 
portant immediate and assured future needs. 
(3) ... to explore by means of material in itself worth- 
while, the interests, aptitudes, and capacities of pupils. 
(4) . .. to reveal to pupils, by material otherwise justifiable, 
the possibilities in the major fields of learning. 
(5) . .. to start each pupil in the career which, as a result 
of the exploratory courses, he, his parents, and the school are 
convinced is most likely to be of profit to him and to the 
state. 
The Senior High School.—The extensive developments 
in the public high schools are best understood by an exami- 
nation of some of the curricula now offered. By courtesy 
of Charles H. Lake, assistant superintendent in charge of 
high schools of the Cleveland public-school system, we are 
permitted to illustrate the tendency to differentiate by pre- 
senting the outlines of the curricula of three types of high 
schools—the one offering a general course, the technical 
high school, and the commercial high school.

  98 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
Such diversified offerings present a sharp contrast to the 
small rural high school which may be struggling along 
with one teacher, a short term, a one-, two-, or three-year 
course of study, and very poor equipment. Unhappily 
there still exist many of these rural institutions where 
courses are offered in English, history, science, mathe- 
matics, and possibly Latin. The following is typical of 
such conditions. 
Ninth Grade Tenth Grade 
Rhetoric and Composition Plane Geometry 
Algebra American History 
General History Botany and Zodlogy 
General Science Cesar 
Latin Grammar 
It must not be inferred that all of the creditable work 
is done in the large city high school. Doubtless much poor 
work is done there. There are many rural high schools 
where superior teaching exists, where a variety of courses 
are adequately provided, and where building facilities are 
on a high plane. Relatively speaking these schools are 
rare, and are to be found only in those rural sections 
favored by natural wealth, accessibility to markets, and 
people of superior vision. 
The Junior College——As public education gradually

In this same study by Koos the purposes of the institu- 
tion are enumerated as follows:
-P-A-G-E-115
  TYPES OF SCHOOLS 101 
1. To give the first two years of curricula (A) in liberal arts 
and (B) in preprofessional and professional work (where. these 
professional curricula begin with the first college year). 
2. To assure instruction as good as, or better than, that on 
the same level in other higher institutions. 
8. To provide terminal general education for those who 
cannot or should not go on to higher levels of training. 
4. To develop lines of semiprofessional training. 
5. To popularize higher education. 
6. To make possible the extension of home influences during 
immaturity. 
7. To afford more attention to the individual student. 
8. To improve the opportunities for laboratory practice in 
leadership. 
9. To foster the inevitable reorganization of secondary and 
higher education. 
10. To bring together into a single institution all work 
essentially similar in order to effect a better organization of 
courses and obviate wasteful duplication. 
Higher Education 
A college is an institution above secondary rank which is 
undergraduate in character and offers courses leading to a 
bachelor’s degree. The university is composed of colleges 
and schools. The latter offers graduate work leading to the 
higher degrees in addition to the undergraduate courses. 
The kinds of work offered in a large university 
present a wide range and variety. As illustrative 
one might mention the college of liberal arts, the 
school of medicine, the school of dental surgery, the 
school of journalism, the school of mining, the schools 
of electrical, mechanical, and civil engineering, the law - 
school, the school of practical arts, and among the more 
recent developments, the school of education. The univer- 
sity is more largely concerned with professional education 
and the courses offered range from Egyptian archeology to 
photo-play writing.

  102 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
State Support for Higher Education.—There is an in- 
creasingly strong tendency for states to encourage higher 
education. This tendency has resulted in the establishment 
of state universities and state colleges. In the case of New 
York, a state which has no state university, the legislature 
appropriates money for the support of a State School of 
Agriculture at Cornell University, a State School of 
Forestry at Syracuse University, and a State School of 
Ceramics at Alfred University. In addition, individual 
scholarships are offered for qualified high-school graduates 
who wish to take advantage of the opportunities offered 
through training in institutions of higher education. 
Vocational Education 
Due to various political, economic, and geographical 
reasons, vocational education in the United States did not 
become widespread until a relatively recent date. Many 
European countries had been able to advance industrially 
through the results of different types of industrial voca- 
tional education. Industrial education through appren- 
ticeship had long given way to modern tendencies in manu- 
facturing, but we still felt that manual training and com- 
mercial work was sufficient in vocational fields. The rapid 
agricultural development in this country naturally led to 
the establishment of agricultural vocational education. A 
national commission on vocational education was created, 
and its findings really gave the impetus which led to the 
present development of vocational education. Various 
legislative proposals were made. The Smith-Hughes Bill 
was an important measure. It provided among other 
items for the establishment of a Federal Board for Voca- 
tional Education.  
-P-A-G-E-117
TYPES OF SCHOOLS 103 
Vocational guidance emerged from the mass of problems 
as a useful means of direction. Trade schools, both day 
and evening, for both sexes were created, continuation 
school laws were passed in many states, and so on the story 
proceeds. Vocational education, while a product in this 
country only of the last quarter-century, seems to be fairly 
well established. 
Problems of Rural Education 
Greater progress has been made in the organization of 
city-school education than of rural-school education. That 
is partly due to the fact that the city operates in relatively 
large units where leadership is more unified and probably 
more effective in consequence. The rural school has been 
compelled to rely upon a vast number of small administra- 
tive and supervisory units with little uniformity of pro- 
cedure and no great unity of leadership. Isolation has 
played an important part in this lack of progress, but with 
the advent of good roads, improved transportation and. 
communication facilities, the spread of influence of the 
press, ete., country conditions have changed. But rural 
school education has remained without much change. 
True there have been places where modern school build- 
ings, adequately equipped and staffed, have taken form. 
Then, too, the consolidation or centralization movement 
has had a large influence, but in general the rural school 
is still inadequate as a physical plant and its teachers are 
poorly prepared and poorly paid. The problem is acute. 
Rural education is as important as urban education and 
the boys and girls of the country need as favorable educa- 
tional opportunities as their city cousins. Beginning 
teachers should familiarize themselves with rural condi- 
   
-P-A-G-E-118
  104 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
tions and encourage every movement which would tend to 
improve teaching conditions in rural communities. 
A State Organization 
The magnitude of educational organization becomes 
apparent in studying the chart of the State Department of 
Public Instruction for the Commonwealth of Pennsyl- 
vania on page 105. Expert leadership, in all departments 
of educational endeavor, marks the success of a great 
system of schools. Other states may present different 
types of organization, but this chart enables one to see a 
state’s problem in the large. 
Federal Aid for Education 
No mention of education is to be found in the Constitu- 
tion of the United States. The inference is clear that the 
founders of our government believed that education was a 
state and not primarily a federal function. The history of 
those countries in which education was a matter of govern- 
ment control indicates the possible dangers. While there 
have been sporadic attempts to encourage federal control, 
the general theory of education as a state function has per- 
sisted. There have been measures passed and many others 
proposed related to federal aid, but there is a noteworthy 
distinction between aid and control. It is possible to have 
aid without control, although history is rather convincing 
that too strong safeguards against control cannot be pro- 
vided. Recent proposals for federal aid for education 
should be carefully studied from this viewpoint. 
It is significant that there is no national university in 
the United States, although that has been discussed as a 
possibility since the early days of the republic. The well 
prepared teacher will appreciate, through a real knowledge

  CHAPTER VII 
FORCES PROMOTING EDUCATION 
It has been pointed out that human beings are prone to 
generalize. Generalization has its merits and its proper 
place. Both inductive and deductive thinking employ 
generalization as an important step, the former, building 
a thesis from known facts and processes, the latter, starting 
with a principle as an assumption and establishing its 
truth or falsity through gathering and arranging related 
facts. Induction and deduction are rarely separated. In 
either case if the processes are fully employed, the gener- 
ality is useful as a step in the learning process. But too 
often in life a generality, principle, or thesis is accepted 
without verification. Therein lies a danger. 
A common fallacy is to credit the school as an institu- 
tion solely responsible for education. Not infrequently do 
we hear that some fault or defect in attitude, habit, or 
way of thinking which happens to be especially con- 
spicuous is charged as a weakness of the existing educa- 
tional practices. It is perfectly obvious upon reflection 
that such generality is quite likely to be far from the truth. 
Actual facts upon careful examination may completely or 
in part exonerate the school from all blame. The school 
should in no way shirk its responsibilities, yet intelligent 
teachers will be aware of other factors affecting the educa- 
tive process and will thereby be better able to establish 
& 109

110 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
| the school as an agency in education in its proper relation 
} to other agencies. The results would in all probability be 
increased zeal on the part of all to support the schools. | 
The Home 
To what extent the home as an educational agency acts 
either positively or negatively is difficult to determine. 
Most people would rank the home as the leading factor in 
shaping the ideals and forming the habits of boys and girls. ' 
There is, at the same time, a feeling that the modern home 
is less effective as a direct agency than its predecessor of 
colonial times. Whether this is precisely true is a matter 
of speculation, but a discussion of some of the conditions 
surrounding both may throw some light upon the question. 
It is certainly true that many changes have occurred in 
home life in this country during the last two centuries. 
In colonial days the home was in comparative isolation 
from other homes. The settler, the frontiersman, the pio- 
neer often found it necessary to keep the members of his 
family in close proximity in order to protect them. Trans- 
portation and communication were inconvenient, and 
entertainment, such as it was, originated at home. The 
head of the house read to his family during the long eve- 
nings, and discussions followed which tended to solidify 
family thought. The fireplace afforded an inviting temp- 
tation to gather about it and thus developed the fireside 
circle. Education under such conditions was bound to be 
certain, even if somewhat limited in point of view. The 
influence of parental tutelage constituted the chief and in 
many cases the only means of education. As settlements 
increased in size, the spread of educational opportunity 
grew apace, but until books, newspapers, and magazines
-P-A-G-E-125
FORCES PROMOTING EDUCATION 111 
became more common, and until dangers of travel became 
less, the family circle retained its power as the chief educa- 
tional force. 
Contrast the isolation of the colonial home with the 
present-day conditions. Books, magazines, and newspapers 
are readily accessible if not actually a part of the home. 
The telephone, telegraph, and radio make it possible 
through the. united news service to keep informed of hap- 
penings throughout the world. The telephone makes 
neighborhood gossip and long distance communication 
alike possible. The telegraph flashes its messages around 
the world. The radio enables any member of the house- 
hold to “tune in” on concerts from far and near. Market 
quotations, sporting events, political speeches, sermons, 
lectures, ete., are brought right to the fireside, which, in all 
probability, has given way to the steam radiator. Good 
roads, automobiles, per capita wealth, theaters and cine 
mas, all figure in the dissolution of the family circle as 
it once was. While the radio may offset neighborhood 
amusements, it does not follow that the family circle is 
restored. It may mean quite the contrary—that the whole 
world walks into the home and displaces the head of the 
house as the central figure. What is the result? It is 
difficult to determine. One cannot with assurance state 
that the training of the children of preschool age has 
remained the same. Millions of automobiles take father, 
mother, and the children out for “a drive,” and when they 
return home, it is by no means clear that there is an hour 
of study, discussion, or devotion before retiring. Yet 
the influence of the home, centered about the father and 
mother, leaves its imprint upon the attitudes and habits 
of each child.

112 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
Groups of children upon entering school differ widely. 
While much depends upon heredity, home environment 
cannot be discounted. Since such differences are so notice~ 
able, are teachers not justified and obligated to inquire 
into home conditions in order better to help the child? 
What economic conditions in general prevail? Are both 
parents in healthy physical condition? Are there racial 
traits to be considered? Are there family idiosyncrasies 
to be observed? Have the parents desirable esthetic, liter- 
ary, and musical tastes? The conscientious teacher will 
not neglect home factors in striving to develop the child 
during the relatively short time he is in school. It is one 
of the teacher’s obligations professionally to know and 
understand home conditions, as the child is doubtless 
vitally influenced by all home factors to an appreciable 
degree. 
The Community 
As our country developed both commercially and indus- 
trially, people found it advantageous to live in groups. 
And as communities formed, the necessity of codperative 
group life became more and more evident. In colonial 
life physical protection was a factor, and in later indus- 
trial life economic protection and advantages became an 
important element. As communities became increasingly 
heterogeneous in personnel, rules and regulations were 
formulated. Individual rights, as well as social. obliga- 
tions, had to be observed and the process of learning to 
live together was a potent educative factor. At first the 
obligation of contributing to a good group life was pri- 
marily an individual problem, but as political, religious, 
economic, and racial problems became more complex, there 
 
-P-A-G-E-127
  FORCES PROMOTING EDUCATION 113 
developed a group consciousness of responsibility toward 
the individual members of the community. Schools were 
a direct outgrowth of this consciousness. But there were 
other means provided for the development of desirable 
group relationships which are not to be neglected as forces 
promoting education. Further analysis will establish 
their true importance. 
The children in modern communities are provided play- 
ground facilities where definite educative processes obtain, 
under direct guidance of expert leaders. Parks where 
trees, shrubs, plants, birds, insects, and other natural phe- 
nomena exist afford ample opportunity for extensive educa- 
tion. Museums, botanical and zodlogical gardens, and 
libraries bring the world within easy reach. Entertain- 
ment through lectures, concerts, and motion pictures makes 
possible a liberal education. Clubs, societies, and other 
organizations are formed under community leadership to 
meet various objectives. As examples of such clubs are 
the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Campfire Girls, corn clubs 
and others interested in phases of agricultural life, glee 
clubs, debating societies, and so on. Then there are pro- 
moted such movements as Clean-up Week, Thrift Cam- 
paigns, Red Cross activities, health measures, and the like. 
While these are in many cases for community benefit, the 
fact remains that they are intrinsically educative and are 
group enterprises by which each other’s problems and obli- 
gations are better understood. What is done in varying 
degrees for the children is attempted for adults as well. 
Community life provides tangible means of promoting 
education. Again, it is the teacher’s responsibility to 
understand the complexity of modern community life in 
order that school activities may assume their proper per- 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
  114 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
spective in the thoughts and plans of both teachers and 
community-activity leaders. 
The Church 
The church as well as the school was a direct outeome 
of community life, as well as a means of individual expres- 
sion. Before the Reformation the church dominated edu- 
cation, and while it may not be true that that influence 
has diminished in total, yet it is true that since the Refor- 
mation there are many parts of the civilized world not 
dominated by church control. Our own country is an 
example of separation of church and state. The church is 
certainly a potent factor in community life to-day. Dif- 
ferences of opinion may exist regarding its degree of 
power over adults, but it is in all probability true that 
young children who come under the influence of the church 
are as vitally affected as ever. To the extent that the 
church engenders prejudice, fear, intolerance, and ani- 
mosity, to that degree is its influence deplorable. The 
same caution may be applied with equal force to non-sec- 
tarian organizations concerned with the lives of human 
beings. There is universal opinion that the church should 
remain as one of the bulwarks of community life, and as 
such a foundational element its educative force should be 
utilized wisely and to the utmost. It will be noted that 
religion in any of its scores of forms is not under discus- 
sion in connection with education, but that the church as 
a material form of religious expression constitutes an 
organization which inherently touches the problem of edu- 
cation. It may be mainly religious education, but its 
importance is none the less real as a part of American 
community life. What the future of the church may be
-P-A-G-E-129
  
FORCES PROMOTING EDUCATION 115 
in the process of education seems likely to hinge upon 
amicable settlement of denominational and sectarian dif- 
ferences. The teacher who disregards the influence of the 
church as a force in education is doomed to meet trouble. 
American life has as a fundamental element the right to 
worship God according to the dictates of one’s conscience. 
For the teacher that means religious toleration. Codpera- 
tion with church agencies and not aloofness will multiply 
the child’s chances for a well-rounded equipment and 
fortify community progress. : 
The State 
In a previous discussion a state organization for promot- 
ing education was pictured. At this point it is desirable 
that the state be considered as a combination of communi- 
ties resolving themselves into a larger community. As the 
group is composed of individuals and the community of 
many groups, so is the state constituted through conscious 
codperation of many communities. In such an amalgama- 
tion the stronger encourage and assist the weaker in order 
that the relationship and strength of the whole may be 
more enduring. Thus education becomes a state function 
as well as the concern of local communities. 
The Nation 
Like the state the national government becomes a party 
to the encouragement of education through its many agen- 
cies. The policy of this country has been to encourage 
and to a limited extent support public schools, but the 
control of schools has been definitely a state function. 
Prussia and France offer well-known examples of the effect 
of national control of education. This control varies in 
form and intensity, but the observable results are so
-P-A-G-E-130
116 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
marked as variations in the national history of each are 
studied that there can be little doubt that a general policy 
of state control in a form of government such as ours is 
preferable to national participation beyond encouragement 
and support. 
Other Agencies 
The teacher must scrutinize all the elements of com- 
munity, state, and national life for forces assisting or 
hindering social progress through education in all its 
forms. In the United States it is estimated that over 
fifteen million people are members of fraternal and secret 
organizations, Education is inevitably a result. It may 
not be in every case desirable education, but anything 
which adds new meaning to the various aspects of life is 
education. Gang life, mob action, political demonstra- 
tions, observance of religious rites, social conventionalities, 
industrial troubles, international disputes, all offer educa- 
tion of some kind in some degree. Truly, the public-school 
teacher needs to be well informed, balanced, and deter- 
mined, if the ideals of public education are to be realized.

  CHAPTER VIII 
CLASSROOM OBSERVATION FOR BEGINNING TEACHERS 
Quite properly there have been questions raised con- 
cerning the values of classroom observation not preceded 
by worthwhile teaching experience. As general practice 
goes, observation of the teaching process accompanies 
methods courses. This is doubtless important, and there 
seems to be no general disposition to change such a plan 
of combining methods and theory with the observation of 
actual classroom conditions. 
There is much to be gained, however, by identifying 
teaching problems with concrete illustrative situations 
from the outset. In the first place the teaching problems 
become real, and abstract discussion gives way to a con- 
sideration of specific problems. This tends to create in 
the beginning teacher a sense of reality and significance 
regarding the professional aspects of the new field of 
endeavor. In the second place, observation in connection 
with an introductory course may well facilitate the work 
done later as a part of the special-methods courses. That 
is to say, the student will have been trained in right habits 
of observation and has a better basis for beginning more 
comprehensive work in observation than he otherwise 
would have. 
Serious dangers emerge at the outset. Do beginning 
teachers know what to expect in classroom procedure? 
120 ‘ 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
  OBSERVATION 121 
Are they capable with their limited professional experi- 
ence to evaluate the classroom elements existing? What 
can be done to help them? How shall the observation 
periods be made of real professional value to beginning 
teachers? Suggestions will be made in this discussion and 
problems raised which will be an attempt to answer in 
part some of the foregoing questions. 
Understanding the Purposes 
It is worse than useless to tell a student to visit Room X 
and observe for an hour. Not only is he likely to see noth- 
ing in particular or in general, but he is quite apt to form 
undesirable habits and to become a nuisance to the teacher 
of the class. The instructor in charge of observation can 
preclude all such difficulties, by following such suggestions 
as: (1) Discover through previous conference with the 
teacher what the general objectives are of the work to be 
observed. Then identify the anticipated lesson with a 
special purpose. The realization of that purpose is the 
real test of teaching. (2) The beginning observer need 
not attempt to analyze the means used in reaching the ends 
sought but should accustom himself to sensing the identifi- 
cation and accomplishment of purposes. 
The foregoing may appear to be a reversal of what 
should take place. That is, it may seem that judging suc- 
cess in accomplishment may be an advanced step. In the 
sense here used it belongs first. Understanding the pur- 
poses of the teacher does not necessarily imply justification 
of objectives, nor does determining success in the accom- 
plishment imply the use of scientific measurement. The 
observer merely finds out what the teacher hopes to do. 
It may be that the purpose of the lesson is to teach the 
   
-P-A-G-E-136
ee te ee eee 
122 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
importance of the invention of the printing press. Any- 
one can say whether the teacher taught that or the dis- 
covery of America. The exact degree of success will 
remain unknown to the observer, but the reactions of the 
class will enable him to justify an opinion. 
Emphasis upon Essentials 
So far the observer has not been interested in the means 
employed by the teacher. As soon as he is acclimated, as 
it were, then special problems may be undertaken. But 
again, caution must be taken that attention be directed 
toward essential things. This the instructor can accom- 
plish by skillful assignments. Not only will the instructor 
use care in selecting essential factors in the lesson for 
study, but he will avoid directing attention to too many 
elements in the situation. At this stage of development 
great care should be taken that only good teaching is 
observed. The various conceptions of teaching gs out- 
lined in Chapter V could be studied one by one under 
actual school conditions, and others made more intelligible. 
In this connection the teacher as an essential is not to be 
overlooked. Chapter IV introduces a study of the qualifi- 
cations, and specific traits may be observed with a view of 
magnifying the importance of high standards of excellence 
as regards qualifications.   
»» » Consideration of Physical Conditions 
This field of observational opportunity presents definite 
problems. Good standards for buildings and equipment 
should be the aim of all teachers. Hence, a knowledge of 
such standards and a trained ability to sense excellences 
and defects is an essential part of each successful teacher’s 
equipment. The Strayer and Engelhardt score cards for
-P-A-G-E-137
OBSERVATION 123 
high-school buildings, for elementary-school buildings, and 
for rural-school buildings will furnish an excellent basis 
for such observation. Care must be exercised that not too 
many items are included in a single assignment, else the 
value of the observation will be lost. 
Reflection upon Problems Raised 
Mere observation will count for little. The instructor 
must constantly check the results. No better way exists 
than by subsequent evaluation of the points observed. 
Their individual importance, their relation to each other, 
their significance in relation to the stated purposes of the 
teaching,—all furnish a wealth of material for later dis- 
cussion. Free discussion on a professional level is to be 
encouraged. Personal references are to be avoided where 
desirable personal relations are thereby endangered. All 
this discussion may readily fit the general study suggested 
in this book, and as a result the observation period will 
become more valuable and the study assume greater 
significance. 
Conferences 
Group meetings may be held to “pool” criticism, sug- 
gestions, and conclusions. These may and should extend 
beyond the limits of the observation group to the teachers 
observed. The following is an indication of the possible 
outcome of such a series of conferences. A group of stu- 
dents who had been instructed to look for various definite 
factors in a kindergarten situation held conferences among 
their own group and summarized under the two headings: 
(1) commendable elemertts and (2) weak points and con- 
structive criticism. This was made possible after several 
» observation periods, during which time this form of out-

After an hour’s discussion with the kindergarten teach-

sidered, the kindergarten teachers were able to formulate 
explanations for some of the criticisms made, and to justify 
some procedures. The following is a résumé of their report

Specify teachers; only four were teachers, others were

Specify teachers. Was it attitude or action? Give 
instance. Were children in fear?

Experimental work was being stressed. Need for teach- 
ers’ suggestions had not arisen. Children do imitate 
each other. Imitation should be free. 
Give instance. 
Suggest material and kindly supply it for us. 
Children too young to analyze work. Purposes of chil- 
dren had been previously stated. Children work for 
activity rather than result. Children work and play 
for own enjoyment and rarely discuss it. 
Later in period results are displayed, and approval and 
encouragement is always given. 
Correction as to technique should come later. At first, 
idea is more important than technique; child chooses 
his own project and method. Child discovers difficulty.

differences as to energy and initiative. Suggestions 
of teachers not quite so readily received as usual.

15. This point not allowed. 
C. Constructive Criticism: 
1. Individual encouragement is constantly given. Ob- 
server saw but one short period. 
2. Accept gladly. Offer definite suggestions. 
8. Model of what? Cannot bring in models for experi- 
mentation. Child is working to carry out own concep- 
tion. Models can only come in to clarify ideas. Might 
retard progress of idea. 
4. Tools will be gladly received. 
5. Purpose already in teachers’ minds and partly carried 
out. We need another bulletin board. 
6. Young children do not compete naturally or gain by it. 
Work more for activity than results. Individual differ- 
ences in method forbid competition. Results could be 
compared. 
7. Grouped according to age and ability. Some absent. 
8. Child had to develop from known to unknown. 
9. Tools can be handled best only by natural hand. Gayle 
persistently uses tools with left hand. 
10. Material limited to paper and wood for day. 
11. Plenty of floor space when visitors are not there. 
12. Child changed his mind and did not paint. 
18. They usually are excused.   Checking Results 
A revisit will often enable the observer to see evidences 
of growth on the part of both teacher and pupils. When 
the observer feels that his suggestions have contributed to 
the room development, the work of the observation period 
becomes a privilege. He is at once a vital part of the 
organization. This follow-up work really serves two pur- 
poses; first, to stimulate the observer to a keen personal 
interest in the activities of classroom teaching, and, sec- 
ondly, to stimulate and encourage the teachers and pupils 
to greater efforts.

CHAPTER IX 
PROBLEMS OF PARTICIPATION 
| In some schools for the professional preparation of 
| teachers the student will be required to take an active part 
in classroom procedure. This will vary from assisting the 
regular teacher in the mechanized routine work to full 
teaching responsibility. For this group and for those who 
may at this point desire an elaboration of the discussion 
on the values and methods of observation, this chapter is 
included as an introduction to a course which in many 
curricula is known as general method, class management, 
school economy, or technique of teaching. A complete 
treatise of the problems of participation is not claimed. 
What is needed for beginners in order that their outlook 
at the start may be more definite is the purpose of the 
following considerations. 
Written Lesson Planning 
There is practically no opposition to the theory that 
student-teachers shculd learn to plan lesson work intelli- 
gently. The real and justifiable opposition comes in the 
case of written lesson planning that is held to any rigid 
form. Lessons var¢ so much in types that no formality 
of procedure can be}safely recommended. Furthermore, 
any formal method df lesson planning holds the danger of 
curbing in the student-teacher the essential quality of 
132 Lt 
. 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
Pie a a Rr gee ERC eae 
PROBLEMS OF PARTICIPATION 133 
initintiv Habits of procedure are formed and no varia- 
tion seems possible. Again, the teacher needs to be re- 
sourceful. If taught to depend upon a formal lesson plan 
there is always the tendency to_rely upon the contents of 
the plan, and it is practically impossible for a teacher to 
anticipate every situation which may demand resourceful- 
ness of a high order. 
So muéh for the written lesson plan from the point of 
view of the teacher. As an aid to the teacher it may be 
very valuable, but if we hold to the thesis that school 
activity is justifiable only. in so far as it reacts favorably 
upon the child then we must inquire into the value of 
written lesson planning a little further. Teaching, we 
must agree, is more than hearing recitations. It must 
include a plan of study for the pupil. If, then, the lesson 
plan serves this purpose its use may be defended. 
The McMurrys, De Garmo, and others after carefully 
studying the Herbartian methods ably advocated the five 
formal steps in learning—zpreparation, comparison and 
selection, testing, generalization, and conclusion. These 
fife stéps for a long time formed the framework for lesson 
planning. There was and still is much merit in the process, 
but the danger lies in the over emphasis which leads to 
rigid formality... By adequate lesson planning we under- 
stand that it is necessary. to comprehend fully the magni- 
tude of the general unit to be studied. Under present 
conditions it is well to take into’ account the approximate 
length of time which*may be devoted to one general unit 
and then to plan the number and extent of specific prob- 
lems accordingly. Again it is urged that rigid adherence 
to any such plan may defeat its-véry purpose but as a 
general guide in the development of a unit of study it may 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
a 
134 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
be very useful. It can scarcely be denied that a clear con- 
ception of the general problem to be solved and the neces- 
sary specific steps to be taken in the process of solution 
are indispensable to both teacher and pupil. It is an evi- 
dent truth that if we set out upon a journey without any 
definite destination that we ramble here and there, loiter 
at this place and that, and in due course of time we find 
ourselves back at the starting place. We may have enjoyed 
the sunlight, fresh air, and exercise, but even that would 
be by chance unless we definitely set out with that purpose 
in mind. On the contrary, we may be confronted by the 
problem of reaching a city fifty miles distant to keep an 
important appointment at a certain place and find that we 
have three hours in which to accomplish our purpose. We 
v know where we are going and why and we proceed to find 
the very best way of solving the problem. There is no 
idling, we follow the most direct route by the best available 
means of transportation with all possible speed consistent 
with safety. The result is that we accomplish our purpose 
with a feeling of satisfaction. It is equally necessary for 
the teacher and learner to approximate as nearly as pos- 
sible the conditions of the latter situation. In this respect 
| the lesson plan is essential. For successful teaching a com- 
plete mastery of subject matter is a requiremmciit’ ‘To help 
insure this the beginner may well profit by outlining the 
materials to be studied indicating the important points to 
be mastered by the pupils. As an aid to the pupils the 
teacher will need to raise questions and problems of various 
kinds, to stimulate helpful discussions, and to furnish exer- 
cises, all of which are the means by which the pupil real- 
izes the end—the end being the solution of the par- 
ticular problem in the light of the general unit of study.

PROBLEMS OF PARTICIPATION 135 
Added to such an outline of materials and its related out- 
tine of suggestions for study, the written lesson plan may 
profitably, for pupil and teacher, include_a comprehensive 
ide for reading which may make use of both textbook 
and collateral Fon Such a form of lesson planning, 
if done for each consecutive lesson and done well in ad- 
vance of the time the work is to be undertaken, provides 
per se the materials for assignments. Care should be 
taken in the recitation unit to make the assignment per-L/ 
feetly tloar, ‘THis is undoubtsaly-s Fundamental factor in 
good teaching. 
It may prove desirable, especially in graded practice- 
teaching, to permit the student-teacher to follow a graded 
system of lesson planning. Detailed written lesson plans 
may lose their effectiveness as the teacher becomes more 
proficient in classroom procedure. In other words, mi? 
- nutely developed daily written lesson plans may become 
burdensome as the student-teacher progresses from the 
stage of novice to that of an efficient classroom teacher. 
In this case the wise supervisor will gradually eliminate 
the less important elements of the lesson plan. It is con- 
ceivable that a student-teacher might reach such a point of 
efficiency that a general weekly or monthly plan of work j/ 
would be sufficient evidence of adequate preparation. 
“First things first” should be the rule. 
Accompanying this: discussion are forms used in the 
training school department of the Oswego State Normal 
School.. In addition to what has been mentioned with

-P-A-G-E-158
  144 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
In this classification four factors will be considered: the 
teacher, the pupils, the subject matter, and the methods. 
The chapter dealing with the qualifications of a teacher 
bears directly upon the first factor in a study of class man- 
agement. Since under this caption we mean the general 
atmosphere conducive to effective work and the resultant 
of well-balanced factors in the situation, we may ap- 
proach this consideration of the teacher from a different 
angle. 
Sincerity——In the first place sincerity, earnestness of 
purpose, is a requisite. How often have we heard that 
children of school age more quickly than any one else can 
detect superficiality! Let the young teacher be unduly 
interested in a member of the opposite sex, or occupied 
with a correspondence course intended to prepare for some 
phase of business service, or distracted by an over-amount 
of participation in athletic activities, to the exclusion of 
concentrated interest in the immediate work of the school 
and the reaction of the pupils is soon evident. They have, 
as we usually say, “lost interest.” On the other hand, here 
is a teacher devoted to the obligations and privileges of 
teaching. The physical, mental, and moral welfare of the 
pupils is the first consideration. Other interests of life 
are subordinated to this preéminently important work. 
The pupils are fired by a desire to codperate with such a 
teacher. The teacher is enthusiastic—the pupils are eager 
to progress; the teacher is devoted to their interests—they 
will respond by honest effort; the teacher is master of the 
subject matter—they respect such mastery and desire to 
emulate it; the teacher has poise, self-control, dignity, 
clarity of purpose—the pupils respond by sincere admira- 
tion, appreciation, understanding and the will to do.
-P-A-G-E-159
  
PROBLEMS OF PARTICIPATION 145 
Simplicity—Sincerity can scarcely be imagined with- 
out simplicity—in dress, in speech, in manners, in aspira- 
tions. The teacher is known for what character he really 
possesses. Artificiality, distorted notions about this or 
that, unwarranted ambitions, unreal depiction of ordinary 
situations, all combine to arouse in the pupils a deep-seated 
distrust. We are all too well aware of our dread of the 
coming visit of the city cousin. The polished shoes, the 
fashionable clothes, the sophisticated air, the superior atti- 
tude—all these tend to drive us into a state of frenzy. 
When the city cousin arrives we are whole-heartedly on 
the defensive. Much to our surprise we may find him a 
real human being. Our imagination may have carried us 
far afield. His differences, we find, much to our delight, 
are due to differences in environment, which incidentally 
are rapidly disappearing. At heart, he is the same sincere 
being we hoped for but scarcely expected. When our coun- 
try cousin visits us, we experience much the same feeling 
of dismay at his probable appearance of awkwardness and 
strangeness. But our dread is turned to pleasure when we 
find him natural and sincere. So it is all through life; we 
react favorably to sincerity and simplicity and adversely 
toward superficialities. 
Thoroughness.—Sincerity begets thoroughness. We are 
taught by many influences never to leave a task uncom- 
pleted. This notion becomes so thoroughly established in 
theory, if not in practice, that at an early age we are able 
to discern laxity in any undertaking. The teacher who 
proceeds surely toward the realization of an objective 
thereby does much to create a morale leading to earnest 
effort on the part of the pupils. A strong evidence of thor- 
oughness is excellent scholarship. This is not always true.
-P-A-G-E-160
  146 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
For instance one with unusually high mental ability may 
attain relatively high scholarship, but for the great mass 
of teachers it is probably safe to assume that high scholar- 
ship in general is the result of thorough work. This is 
readily interpreted by the pupils. Any evidence of thor- 
oughness which does not smack of stubbornness or obsti- 
nacy is in general sure to evoke the same kind of effort on 
the part of the pupils. At any rate it is not a negligible 
factor in class management. 
Sympathy.—As a factor in this classification sympathy 
is intended to mean a complete understanding of problems 
affecting our daily activities. Here is a boy whose mother 
is dead and whose father is an indigent scamp who hinders 
rather than encourages. The boy is physically under- 
nourished, spiritually starved, yet struggling to keep his 
place in school among his schoolmates. It isn’t pity he 
wants; it is an understanding, oftentimes unexpressed in 
words, that satisfies and brings forth in him the best he 
has. Each child has problems to him of serious portent, 
and when he feels that a teacher out of the desire really to 
help makes the effort to ascertain and interpret the facts 
of his case, then he is bound by unbreakable ties to help the 
one who has so helped him. Woe to the teacher who turns 
this advantage to his own selfish purposes. Only for the 
sake of the development of the child is any such action by 
the teacher warrantable. 
Manner and Manners.—Sincerity, simplicity, thorough- 
ness, and sympathy are powerful determinants of manners. 
Manners are attitude. It is the inclination to serve or be 
served. If the former, the teacher has accomplished much 
naturally that can be secured in no other way. Once a 
proponent of a new idea in educational procedure pre-
-P-A-G-E-161
PROBLEMS OF PARTICIPATION 147 
sented his views before a group of school men. The next 
day another who held an opposing view gave his side of 
the question. The first won friends to his plan by his 
manner; the other by his ridicule and sarcasm won friends 
for the cause he opposed. The attitude of the teacher 
has much to contribute toward desirable class manage- 
ment. 
Manners are often the external features of the inner 
self. By manners we do not mean conventional form of 
behavior of which the best people may be almost ignorant, 
but the courtesies natural to true womanhood and man- 
hood. The writer was privileged to learn a lesson along 
this line early in his professional life. He was seated in a 
public park with a former teacher, a gentleman of unusual 
manners. <A street urchin came by with his boot-blacking 
box and brushes. To his customary cry of “Shine, 
Mister?” this gentleman replied in tones of utmost cour- 
tesy with no trace of condescension, “No, thank you.” 
Instead of insistence to the point of expectorating upon the 
shoes of his possible customer, he respectfully lowered his 
voice as he passed on to the next man. Manners of the 
right sort will meet with responses of the desired variety 
almost invariably. The wise teacher will cultivate this 
trait to the ultimate advantage of a group of school chil- 
dren at their regular work. 
Acceptable manner and manners will even offset per- 
sonal idiosyncrasies on the part of the teacher. But if the 
teacher’s attitude is right, annoying personal character- 
istics will be rapidly eliminated to the everlasting benefit 
of class management. 
The Pupils: Native Individual Differences.—Differ- 
ences in native physical equipment have long been recog- 
   
-P-A-G-E-162
    148 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
nized. Of more recent date has our consideration of differ- 
ences in mental traits been a factor in classroom procedure. 
The single exception may be the vast differences between 
the two extremes of intellectuality, idiocy and genius. 
Even such instances have been known to have little if any 
effect upon the methods employed by the teacher. One 
teacher, a virile splendid specimen of physical manhood, 
became exasperated by a deformed, mentally deficient boy, 
sixteen years old and still below first-grade standards, and 
flogged him soundly before the entire school. This teacher, 
capable in many ways, cannot be altogether blamed for 
this monstrous educational crime—for so it was in the 
light of modern education. He had had no professional 
education: he had just been graduated from high school 
and he had no previous experience as a teacher. In this 
respect the state was more culpable than he. In the com- 
munity where he was born and had grown to young man- 
hood there was a traditional belief that no teacher should 
use partiality. That meant all should be used exactly 
alike. What a fallacy! In acting as he did he fulfilled 
the teaching to which he had been subjected. Knowing 
now as we do that mentality varies from the lowest to the 
highest forms, impartiality must for the teacher and all 
concerned assume a totally different meaning. Children 
can be treated alike only in so far as they possess similar 
abilities and traits. 
A common fallacy among people generally, which has 
permeated educational circles all too thoroughly is that of 
shunning variability in mental equipment. Some one may 
be vastly superior in physical prowess of one sort or 
another and the rest of his associates are not disgraced. 
We may even be so physically incapacitated that our
-P-A-G-E-163
I 
PROBLEMS OF PARTICIPATION 149 
ability to engage in productive activity is nil, yet we are 
unashamed. Yet any suggestion that our children are less 
brilliant in some respects than our neighbor’s, regardless 
of the conclusive evidence offered as proof and we are filled 
with a consuming wrath. The fact remains that mental 
abilities do vary in degree and kind, and the sooner 
parents, teachers, and children admit its truth the sooner 
will educational policies be shaped to care properly for the 
needs of childhood. The successful teacher will recognize 
these differences, measure them as scientifically as modern 
equipment permits, and act accordingly in her relations 
with pupils within the limits set by prejudice. This preju- 
dice can only be eliminated through education. The chil- 
dren may be expected to accept the facts of individual 
differences as they affect classroom procedure much more 
quickly than their parents. 
The Pupils: Acquired Differences—Native endow- 
ments and environmental conditions will in turn deter- 
mine acquired differences. What has been said of native 
differences may, so far as practical class management 
is concerned, be said to govern the teacher in his rela- 
tions with pupils equally with respect to acquired 
characteristics. 
Subject Matter and Method.—Honest recognition of 
these differences will eventually modify the whole field of : 
educational method. Instead of the same subject matter 
for all in the same doses and at the same speed using the 
same method, educational practice will meet the demands 
of individual differences as rapidly as administrative prob- 
Jems can be solved. It may be said with equal emphasis 
that individual differences, natural and acquired, deter- 
mine the varying interests of children and that these vary- 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
se 
150 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
ing interests should help determine subject matter and 
method. 
It will be noticed that the term “discipline” has not been 
used in this discussion of class management. With favor- 
able conditions as indicated there need be no special atten- 
tion given to discipline as such. As these conditions 
become more and more prevalent the word may very 
well be eliminated in this sense from our educational 
vocabulary. 
Classroom Administration 
While classroom administration directly affects class 
management, its consideration has been reserved for a 
separate place in our study because it tends to deal with 
those external physical problems more or less unrelated 
to the personalities of teacher and pupils. In this cate- 
gory are to be found such classroom problems as seating, 
lighting, ventilation, heating, distribution and arrange- 
ment of materials, convening and dismissing sessions, 
progress reports to parents, records, program making, room 
decoration, and the like. 
Seating.—There are two groups who hold opposing 
opinions concerning the manner of seating. One group: 
holds firmly to the belief that arrangement of desks by 
rows is desirable from the standpoint of good order and 
effective group work. This group is vastly in the ma- 
jority at present if one may judge by the reports of school 
desk manufacturing companies. According to an adver- 
tisement in the American School Board Journal, 95 per 
cent of the desks made and sold are of the stationary type. 
Doubtless on the part of a considerable number this opin- 
ion concerning formal seating is a matter of honest con-
-P-A-G-E-165
PROBLEMS OF PARTICIPATION 151 
viction. Doubtless, also, many classroom teachers continue 
this arrangement because. it is an inheritance from the 
previous school generations, or because of the expense and 
extra work involved in making a change, or, perhaps, 
because of indifference to new ideas of educational pro- 
cedure. 
The other group feels that the formal arrangement of 
desks results in a formal school situation unlike real life 
situations and urge tables and chairs or, at the most, mov- 
able desks. This movement is strongest in kindergarten 
work and in the work of the first three grades. (In fair- 
ness it should be said that many who urge free seating 
plans do so because it is almost habitual unquestioningly 
to join forces with any new idea.) There is a tendency 
in some school systems to have this so-called freedom in all 
grades of the elementary school. The platoon system, so 
well known as it exists in Detroit, has a number of special 
rooms in which the work calls for informal seating. Still 
another plan calling for freedom of action is the so-called 
laboratory classroom. To these rooms—history, English, 
music, etc.—pupils go whenever their work necessitates 
their presence there. They pass in and out at will. The 
room may be frequently used for conference work but no 
formality is encouraged. This can be studied to advan- 
tage in the University School in New York where the 
Dalton plan is in operation under the direction of Miss 
Helen Parkhurst. 
There is common agreement, however, among school 
people concerning many factors affecting any arrangement 
of desks. The height of the seat and the height of the desk 
should be adjusted to fit the size of the individual pupil. 
The seating should permit the light to strike the desk on 
   
-P-A-G-E-166
  152 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
the side opposite the child’s writing arm to avoid shadows 
during any written exercise or desk work of like nature. 
Each classroom, according to the score card for elementary 
schools prepared by Strayer and Engelhardt, should per- 
mit at least fifteen square feet of floor space for each pupil. 
Where the teacher should be in the classroom is a debat- 
able question. It seems probable that this will be largely 
determined by variable factors—the teacher, the number, 
age and general character of the pupils and the nature of 
the work attempted. me 
Lighting.—In regard to the problem of natural and 
artificial lighting, Strayer and Engelhardt’s score-card 
standards for elementary schools will be freely quoted. 
There are some factors which the classroom teacher may 
feel outside his jurisdiction. But if conditions are far 
below standard the teacher should urge all possible im- 
provement. On the other hand, even under ideal lighting 
conditions, the teacher may control such factors as window 
shades, light obstructions, ete. There should be no cross- 
lighting and no lights, natural or artificial, should reflect 
directly in pupils’ eyes. The window mullions should be 
not more than twelve inches wide so that no pronounced 
shadows fall across desks. The bottom of the window 
should be of such a height as not to permit shadows to fall 
across the desks nearest, and the tops of the windows 
should be high enough to prevent shadows on the desks 
located at opposite sides of the room. The distance from 
the front window to the blackboard wall should be seven 
feet to allow the optimum lighting effects upon the black- 
board. The total window space should be 15 per cent of 
the total floor space. 
The score card recommends semidirect lighting when
-P-A-G-E-167
a a i in 
PROBLEMS OF PARTICIPATION 158 
artificial lights must be used scattered throughout the room 
in such a way that nine candle watt power is furnished 
to each desk. 
Heating and Ventilation—The scorecard standards 
recommend a room temperature between 68 per cent and 
70 per cent Fahrenheit. The type of heating plant will 
vary from the needs of the one-room rural school to the 
needs of the large city school. (For a more detailed study 
of heating and ventilation plants see reference at the end 
of this chapter.) The chief importance of the emphasis at 
this point lies in the teacher’s responsibility for the vari- 
ables—temperature, humidity, drafts, and condition of 
equipment to a large extent in many places. Lethargy, 
illness, and unsatisfactory results generally will accom- 
pany laxity in the control of heat and ventilation in the 
classroom. 
Arrangement and Equipment.—The effect upon pupils 
of a disorderly arrangement of school materials will be 
very noticeable. Contrariwise, neatness and convenience 
are commendable conditions favoring good work. The 
textbooks and supplementary books or room library should 
have an attractive case, and both pupils and teacher should 
strive to maintain an orderly appearance. The supplies, 
such as tablets, pencils, ink, etc., if not kept at a central 
supply office, should be contained in a supply cabinet. The 
charts, maps, drawings, bulletin board, display boards, 
ete., should be conveniently located and so arranged in 
such a way as to harmonize with the general setting of 
the room. : 
Room Decoration—It is true that the teacher and 
pupils are the greatest factors in a school “atmosphere,” 
yet no one will deny the importance of good taste and ade- 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
154 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
quacy in classroom decoration. School architecture will 
determine to a considerable extent the general appear- 
ance, but appropriate pictures, bas-reliefs, statuary, wall 
tints, potted plants arranged in good taste will have a pro- 
found effect upon the work of the pupils. The thing to 
guard against is the bare prison-like appearance of many 
classrooms. It might even be charged with some justifica- 
tion that the appearance of the room may be an index of 
the ideals of the teacher—at least an indication of the 
teacher’s appreciation of the beautiful in environment, and 
environmental influences are not to be disregarded in 
schoolroom procedure when there is so general recognition 
of the value of such influences in life situations every- 
where. 
Distribution of Materials—When paper, pens, pencils, 
and the like are distributed for general use much unneces- 
sary confusion can be avoided and a large amount of time 
saved by systematic effort. Two or three monitors, or in 
formal seating, distribution by rows may help solve the 
problem. Individual supply lockers may be advantageous. 
The point of emphasis in this connection is a recognition 
and acceptance of responsibility on the part of all to 
accomplish such necessary routine with a maximum 
of efficiency and a minimum of time and confusion 
to the distinct advantage of each member of the 
group. 
Convening and Dismissing Sessions.—It is probably 
wise to have an hour to determine the time when all pupils 
are expected to be at work upon some part of the school 
program, but there seems to be valid objection to a fixed 
number of hours for so-called work and a separate appor- 
tionment of time for so-called play. The child should be
-P-A-G-E-169
See RTs peaks eats ee ee ee ae eee Ae ee 
PROBLEMS OF PARTICIPATION 155 
conscious of the general purpose of all school activities 
and be ready to take his place in whatever part of the pro- 
gram he finds in operation when he arrives at the school 
in the morning. The same consciousness of purpose, pro- 
vided the working conditions were ideal, would also effect 
the close of the day’s work. Such a conception would pre- 
clude the present formal opening of school at 9.00 a. m. 
and the sharp distinctions now prevalent in school pro- 
grams between recitation periods and intermissions and 
dismissal. The student-teacher will find it necessary to 
adapt herself to existing conditions only hoping 
and striving for needed changes by patient, persevering 
effort. 
Progress Reports to Parents.—This terminology is sug- 
gested because the present trend in reports to parents is 
decidedly in the direction of progress made by the indi- 
vidual pupil in all phases of school life, and emphatically 
away from the usual type of grades given periodically by 
subjects in terms of percentages. After. all, it is the 
growth of the child that is of supreme importance to 
teachers, parents, and children, and any scientific meas- 
urement of progress along any line of pupil development 
is to be heartily weleomed. An indication of the 
trend is observable in the form of report on pages 163 
to 166. 
The teacher cannot place too much emphasis upon the 
right type of progress studies of children. In fact, one of 
the most potent spurs to better achievement is the child’s 
own check upon his progress. If by graphical or other 
means he sees clearly his own efforts pictured, he will do 
much on his own initiative to stimulate interest at home 
upon the undertakings of the school.

Habits and Attitudes Desirable for Good Citizenship 
KEY CHART 
For the Guidance of Teachers and Parents 
Revised 1922 
EXPLANATION OF USE OF CHART 
This chart, together with the accompanying report, is one of 
the means used in the Horace Mann Elementary School in its 
teaching of citizenship. 
The main headings on the chart, indicated by Roman num- 
bers, enumerate such general habits, attitudes, and character- 
istics as go to the making of a good citizen of the school or of 
the community. The items listed below each main heading are 
details especially applicable to school life which constitute the 
general habit or attitude. 
In order to give the parents a well-rounded notion of their 
children as school citizens, the teachers will report on three 
or four of the main headings each quarter. Thus all, or nearly 
all, of the main headings on the chart will be considered during 
the year. A habit or an attitude that needs especial attention 
may receive comment for several successive quarters. 
The method of marking is illustrated by the following: If 
a pupil is frequently remiss in handing in his home work, his 
parents may find under the caption unsatisfactory on the quar- 
terly report the figure 4. By referring to the chart they will 
find that under the general heading of “IV. Promptness” the 
child is not up to our standard in Item 4. If, on the other hand, 
a pupil habitually does good work, the parent may find under 
the caption satisfactory the figure 5, indicating that the child’s 
perseverance, as far as Item 5 is concerned, is commendable.

Reports on habits and attitudes must, necessarily, be less ac- 
curate and less comprehensive than those on studies, as they 
are based on the teacher’s observations and impressions rather 
than on definite data, and because the short school day makes it 
impossible for the teacher to know the pupil well enough to 
pass judgment satisfactorily upon some of the specific acts 
mentioned on the chart.

Interpretation 
The numbers in parentheses at the end of the items represent their 
relative importance, 10 representing the most important items, 9 
representing those of lesser importance, etc. These values were 
assigned by a large number of judges to the items appearing on 
the original chart. Items reworded or added have been assigned 
values by careful comparison with the items already evaluated. 
In order to provide for flexibility in the use of the chart and to 
make possible its improvement through suggestions and the addition 
of new items, space has been left under each heading where new 
items may be entered by the teachers.

This report is a record of actual achievement, not of achievement relative to the 
pupil's ability. “Average” indicates the achievement of the middle half of a representative 
class. It signifies satisfactory work in the case of a pupil of average ability. “Above 
average” indicates the achievement of approximately the upper fourth of the class. This 
mark signifies excellent work. “Below average” indicates the achievement of approximately 
the lowest fourth of the class. It signifies mediocre or poor work, “Failure” indicates 
that the pupil has not reached the required passing mark. 
When a child is reported “Below Average” or “Failure” in any essential school sub- 
ject, the parents are requested to sce the teacher promptly. 
Science, Fine Arts, Industrial Arts, Music, and Physical Education will be reported 
only at the cnd of the second and fourth quarters.

  offices as well as to maintain a complete set of records of 
attendance and achievement in the classroom. It is dis- 
tinetly a problem of classroom administration to make 
these records accessible and available to all interested and 
to systematize the work to bring about a minimum of 
tedium. 
Program Making.—This problem is often the bane of 
the young teacher. As necessary as a carefully prepared 
program is to effective work, there still remains the danger 
of the teacher becoming a slave to the program. Like a 
course of study a program should be a helpful guide but 
never a rigid rule of conduct. A fourth-grade program is 
shown on page 167 to indicate possibilities in program 
making for the young teacher.

  CHAPTER X 
A DISCUSSION OF EDUCATION 
Education, like religion, politics, government, etc., suf: 
fers from a restricted understanding of the term. We in 
America too often think of religion as Methodism, Presby- 
terianism, Unitarianism, Catholicism, or Protestantism. 
Even within such limitations we, fail to appreciate the 
real meanings of the particular labels used. Much less 
frequently do we think of Christianity, Mohamedanism, 
Brahminism, Buddhism, Confucianism. Whenever we 
think of the word religion in its broader aspects its mean- 
ings become far more comprehensive than the usual con- 
ceptions. We seriously limit ourselves in thinking of 
politics as confined to the activities of the Republican and 
Democratic political parties of our own country. To 
how many does government mean more than the adminis- 
trative framework of a political state? How early in 
life do we begin to define democracy carefully? Are the 
‘terms monarchism, aristocracy, autocracy, socialism, com- 
munism, anarchy, ete., thoroughly understood in general ? 
It cannot be denied that on the whole we tend to limit 
our thinking about all of the larger problems of life. 
What would be the result if we greatly extended our 
knowledge of the various aspects of social affairs beyond 
its present boundaries? The answer would be speculative 
to a certain degree. Would such an experiment be of any 
173
-P-A-G-E-188
Pee ere ; 
174 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
  value? The reply must be in the affirmative if we base 
our conclusions on facts known about individuals or 
groups of individuals who have clearly demonstrated their 
mastery over fundamentals. He who sees not beyond the 
boundaries of his own lot or farm cannot hope to attract 
in a favorable way the attention of his neighbors. The 
citizen who appreciates the problems of his community 
and who conscientiously undertakes their solution in the 
light of the common good becomes a leader. Such per- 
sonalities are not difficult to find in any locality. They 
are just few enough in number to be noticeable. Those 
who can think in terms of state, national, or international 
welfare are proportionately fewer as we move from the 
smaller to the larger unit. Thus we have state leaders, 
national standard-bearers, and international statesmen. 
An illustration may serve well to picture the usual 
limitations of the majority as contrasted to the unusual 
breadth of view of the few. A civic organization in a 
lake city of northern New York was given an opportunity 
to study the problems of the St. Lawrence waterway 
project. When a representative of an organization, pri- 
marily interested in the development of the project. from 
the viewpoint of water-power facilities, was invited to 
address the local civic club a vigorous protest was raised 
on the ground that the development of the project would 
be unfavorable to the development of their city. Whether 
they were right or wrong is another matter. The im- 
portant thing in connection with the incident was the 
unwillingness of many local citizens to consider the prob- 
lem from any viewpoint other than their own selfish civic 
welfare. The facts of the case are that those individuals 
who protested most strenuously are scarcely known beyond  
-P-A-G-E-189
A DISCUSSION OF EDUCATION 175 
the city limits and none too well known in their own city. 
The most distressing result of such an attitude of “local 
patriotism,” of which this incident is typical, is the fact 
that competing cities have far outdistanced the one re- 
ferred to, judged by the ordinary standards of civic prog- 
ress. Such are the results of limited vision. 
The parallel could be continued through every walk in 
life. It has been said that “the world will beat a path to 
the door of him who makes the best mouse trap.” Facts 
seem to warrant such a conclusion. Among the clergy 
of this country those who are most beloved by all are 
those who can see not only beyond the narrow problems 
of their own parishes but who can see beyond the barriers 
of denominational prejudice. Who are the great teachers ? 
Not those who have an unfortunately restricted view of 
their profession, but those who have acquired a meaning 
for education and who see any single part in relation to 
the whole. In this sense great teachers may include un- 
usually successful classroom instructors, authorities who 
have contributed to educational literature, and to outstand- 
ing lecturers on educational matters. To be eminently 
successful in one or more of these lines, one must not only 
master his particular field of interests but must see the 
relation of the problems in his special field to all of the 
problems of education. 
The argument is advanced at this point that every class- 
room teacher should, from the outset, become a thorough 
student of education. He should not only familiarize 
himself with the practical aspects of the profession, with 
which this study has been chiefly concerned up to the 
present, but he should as early as possible sense the im- 
portance of the theoretical aspects of education and seri-

ously undertake the mastery of whatever professional 
studies are fundamental to a broad understanding of 
education. 
Definitions of Education 
There are many definitions of education. Each serious 
thinker seems to prefer his own phraseology. His own 
definition may be colored by his particular philosophy of 
education. One student may define education as a prepa- 
ration for life, another as life itself, another may com- 
bine these two thoughts, and still another may have quite 
a different conception of its meaning. Each teacher 
should formulate as early in his professional career as 
possible some definition of education realizing, of course, 
that education will acquire new meanings for him as his 
professional conceptions multiply. 
Some of the most widely used definitions are here 
quoted : 
Education is such an ordering of individual experience in 
the light of past experiences that through the resulting char- 
acter modifications richer experience accrues to all con- 
cerned... . 
Education is the process by which the individual comes into con- 
tinually increasing possession of himself and his powers through 
continually increased participation in the race achievement.* 
Speaking generally, education signifies the sum total of proc- 
esses by which a community or social group, whether small 
or large, transmits its acquired power and aims with a view to 
securing its own continued existence and growth. 
Education may be defined as a process of the continuous 
reconstruction of experience with the purpose of widening and

deepening its social content, while at the same time the in- 
dividual gains control of the methods involved.’ 
Education may be tentatively defined, then, as the process 
by means of which the individual acquires experiences that 
will function in rendering more efficient his future action.’ 
There is emphasis upon the individual in all but one 
of these definitions. That exception stresses the growth 
of the social group. It will be noted that none of the 
definitions quoted omits either by direct statement or by 
inference the relation of the individual to the social 
group. Bagley mentions the importance of “rendering 
more efficient” the individual’s “future action.” Since 
the individual, even a Robinson Crusoe, influences the 
actions of others and is in turn influenced by others, it is 
clear that for all practical purposes, Bagley seems to recog- 
nize the significance of individual development in the light 
of group needs. It seems confusing for the beginning 
student in education to discriminate closely between philo- 
sophical distinctions. Practically, the education of the 
individual means the education of the group since the 
individual is an inseparable unit of the group. Carried 
to the extreme the emphasis upon individual development 
would mean the exclusion of group considerations, that is, 
individual differences would completely dominate the 
processes of education. The other extreme would preclude 
all consideration of the individual which did not take into 
account the common problems of “living together.” Neith- 
er is practicable in modern civilized life. No one urges one

point of view to the exclusion of the other. The careful 
student will be conscious of both individual and group 
needs and so order his thinking and subsequent action. 
Education as Dealing with Specifics 
Students are becoming increasingly aware of the im- 
portance of sharp analysis in considering the many prob- 
lems of education. General theories, principles, concepts, 
or hypotheses are useful in the sense that they furnish a 
foundation for further thinking. But even when general- 
izations are inductively reached they must, under working 
conditions, be broken into their structural units. To say 
that an individual is educated is to state an almost mean- 
ingless phrase. Time was when opportunities for formal 
education existed in agencies which stood for specific pur- 
poses. Now the situation is changed in that there are 
many formal agencies with their somewhat varying pur- 
poses instead of a single standard of scholastic objectives. 
The chapter on types of schools indicated in a general 
way the existing variability. To illustrate the laxity with 
which we use common terms one needs only to mention 
the expression, “He is an educated man.” Doubtless, as 
the statement is usually employed, it is meant that the 
individual in question has had many advantages of school- 
room education. Even so the phrase is too general to 
possess much value. Has this particular person an ele- 
mentary school course, a high-school training, or is he a 
college product? Does he hold a collegiate degree from 
a liberal arts college or from a technical school? Is it an 
academic degree or a professional degree? Does the de 
gree signify A.B., M.A., Ph.D., B.S., M.S., C.E., M.D., 
D.D.S., LL.B., or D.D., etc., ete.? After all these ques- 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
O_O Oe 
A DISCUSSION OF EDUCATION 179 
tions are answered the question of education is still un- 
answered. One might then inquire about the institution 
from which the individual was graduated and might even 
discover the exact nature of the courses for which he was 
given credit and there would still exist the problem of the 
individual’s own capacity to learn, to retain, and to apply. 
It is true that scholastic achievement in terms of a 
collegiate degree or a diploma is a rough measure of 
mental accomplishment but it is by no means accurate. 
The system should prevail only until more adequate means 
of describing one’s intellectual status has been found. 
We are forced, then, if we desire to be precise in our 
estimates, upon the identification of specific educational 
achievements. The beginning student should also be 
warned against the loose application of “educated” only 
to those who have been exposed to certain formal processes 
of education. Many scale the heights of intellectual ac- 
complishment without the assistance of formal agencies 
for the promotion of education. To make a distinction 
between “town and gown” is unfortunate especially when 
such distinctions result in an unsympathetic attitude to- 
ward formal education. 
Education as a Variable 
To assert, then, that a certain one has a good education 
requires the qualification which points out wherein he is 
entitled to such credit. It follows, since education is a 
matter of degree, that it is also a matter of kind. Specific 
education adapted to individual needs must be variable. 
Education is not only variable as regards different indi- 
viduals but it is a variable as regards the individual him- 
self. Each experience of life carries with it an element

of newness and consequently the individual acquires new 
meanings as new situations arise. We are literally dif- 
ferent to-day from that which we were yesterday. Physi- 
ologists tell us that our physical beings undergo a com- 
plete transformation in the course of a seven-year period. 
To a certain extent such a change takes place in our men- 
tal development. After a period of years one returns to 
the scenes of his childhood and wonders, sometimes sadly, 
why the old friends do not appear the same. They greet 
one with the same cordiality and inquire about one’s for- 
tune in life, but after the commonplaces are exchanged 
conversation seems to lag. Formerly, it was an easy mat- 
ter to converse indefinitely. There has been a change. 
The old friends have found new meanings in life as well 
as he who returns has acquired new interests. These 
meanings may have taken different directions and so there 
no longer exists the same number of common interests. 
Sometimes the consciousness of these changes jars us 
unpleasantly, but we must be prepared to recognize the 
fact that education has been going on in spite of the lapse 
of time and the past has given way to the present. 
Specific learning has resulted in variables to which each 
must adjust himself according to his own capacity. 
To illustrate that education differs in degree and kind 
one could produce an endless number of examples. There 
can be no types in the light of existing individual differ- 
ences. Examples of educational variants in degree and 
kind must necessarily consider individual cases as such. 
Case 1.—Myr. A. represents the individual usually con- 
sidered as highly educated. He is a graduate of one of 
the oldest and most widely known eastern universities and 
has studied in foreign universities. He is a classical
-P-A-G-E-195

scholar, has traveled in nearly every part of the civilized 
world, is master of several languages, has met people in 
many walks of life, has acquired conventional ease and 
charm of personality which mark him as a man of unusual 
accomplishments. He is at the present time a college 
professor, is well and favorably known in academic and 
professional cireles, and enjoys the admiration, respect, 
and affection of his associates. It is easily possible to 
identify many of his specific points of achievement and 
experience, the sum total of which constitute his educa- 
tion. Roughly we may say that he is a classicist and a 
linguist but not a scientist nor a technical expert. The 
terms which describe his educational accomplishments 
best as above used are too general, it must be obvious; 
and to measure his educational qualifications accurately 
one would be forced to identify specific educational experi- 
ences and outcomes. 
Case 2.—Mr. B. has a different kind of education. He 
can converse exhaustively upon such subjects as history, 
international relations and diplomacy, polities and gov- 
ernment, medical science, religion, spiritualism, photog- 
raphy, hypnotism and many other subjects about which 
the average citizen has but a superficial knowledge. Mr. 
B. is an expert trap-shooter, a skilled fisherman and 
hunter, a gifted musician, and is no mean literary critic. 
In addition to all of these accomplishments and abilities 
he has his vocation. He is station-master and telegraph 
operator in a small station on a branch line of one of the 
great freight-hauling railroads. He never attended high 
school nor college—in fact, he left the elementary school 
before completing the work there offered. Yet who can 
say that he is an uneducated man? There is to the casual 
 
-P-A-G-E-196

182 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
observer something inconsistent with the mental vigor of 
the man through the half century of his life and his 
present humble though important position. But who 
dares to judge? He has a delightful home, is a force in 
the community life, does his work faithfully and well, 
and seems to have found happiness. But all that is an- 
other story. We are interested in the degree and kind 
of education which the man possesses in an exceptional 
way, and all without the direct aid of formal agencies of 
education. 
Case 3.—Mr. OC. is a section foreman for the same rail- 
road company which employs Mr. B. Mr. C. is a native 
of southern Italy. He speaks two languages—his native 
tongue and English. He has traveled in parts of the 
world with which thousands of American-born citizens 
are unacquainted. He knows his work thoroughly and 
has learned how to manage the men under his direc- 
tion. He, too, is an educated man, but not in the popular 
sense. 
Case 4.—Mr. D. has completed the work of the elemen- 
tary school and of the neighboring high school. He is an 
industrious and capable farm boy who at the age of 
twenty-one had never been outside the Pennsylvania 
county in which he was born. His experiences were lim- 
ited and therefore his education was somewhat restricted 
in degree and kind. 
Case 5.—Mr. E. is an inmate of an institution for the 
care of the feebleminded. He has no articulate language 
yet can understand others and be understood by them 
through a sign language which he has developed. He 
has learned to assist in the work of the kitchen, faith- 
fully performs the simple tasks assigned, and delights in 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
cee 
A DISCUSSION OF EDUCATION 183 
serving others according to his abilities. He has learned 
to do all of his tasks and to that extent he has attained 
an education. 
Case 6.—Mr. F. is a type known as microcephalic. He 
is inarticulate, can walk only with the greatest difficulty, 
is unable to feed himself, and for the most part seems 
unconscious of persons or things in his environment. Yet 
the learning process has not been wholly absent in his life. 
He has been taught to obey two commands—“Come here” 
and “Go back.” 
The last two cases would certainly rank low on any 
educational scale, and yet there is some evidence of learn- 
ing. We can view the scale in reverse order, going from 
the helpless microcephalic to the first two cases which 
would rank high in any distribution of educational achieve- 
ment. To make the scale complete the gaps should be 
filled with the respective intermediate cases until we can 
visualize humanity ranging from the lowest to the highest 
points of intellectual accomplishments. Custom still has 
it that the scholastically trained individual is the educated 
one. In exact meaning that is far from the truth. 
The point might be raised that some animals can be 
trained to a higher point of efficiency than the last two 
eases. Doubtless some of the higher types of animals 
excel some of the lower types of humanity in mental and 
physical reactions. What explains the fact that mankind 
is superior to all of the rest of the animal kingdom? 
Man can profit by his own reactions in a given situation 
and also by the mistakes and successes of others. No 
other animal besides man can so profit. Hence man is 
supreme in the realm of learning.

184 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
Education as a Process 
The imi nerable drops of water which together form 
the mighty Hudson are each possible of identity if one 
could but isolate them from the mass. But taken together, 
in their movement toward the sea, rising, falling, mingling 
and intermingling, they present a solid front of strength 
irresistible in its force. Each tiny drop completely loses 
its individual characteristics, so far as casual observance 
goes, in its relation to the whole. And yet that individu- 
ality remains. Here and there, relatively speaking, some 
use the whole or part of the river for a special purpose. 
It may float battleships and commercial craft of every 
description; it may be a landing place for hydroplanes; 
it may furnish hydro-electric power for millions, and 
so on. 
Even to a greater extent practical applications have 
been made of education. In its complexity, its power, its 
onward movement, education resembles the river. It is a 
process of constant advancement. Contributory streams 
add to and become a part of the main body. Its elements 
are utilized and its force at times is partially directed but 
the general trend of the process is constant. As the process 
of education develops in the individual he gains in power 
of action and control of direction. So it is in the process 
of social development. 
The Concept of Growth 
Growth may be thought of as the revisions of education 
through experiences. Growth is not only adding to stature 
but the fuller development of parts. Educationally we 
grow when we profit by an experience. Of this benefit we 
may be conscious or not, dépending upon the degree of
-P-A-G-E-199
eS ae 
A DISCUSSION OF EDUCATION 185 
intensity of the change in relation to the situation in 
which growth occurs. (To grow educationally is to de- 
velop abilities of many kinds through everchanging ex- 
periences. » Strength begets strength, and as we develop 
educationally we come to the realization that mental 
growth may become indefinite in its scope. With such a 
conception life continuously offers new interests and the 
process of education reveals itself as a constant source of 
satisfactions. 
Education as a Preparation for Life 
Contrasted to the concepts of education as growth and 
as a process we meet the notion that education is a prepa- 
ration for life. Life exists before education begins, and 
so education must be coextensive with life. To think of 
learning as a fortification against later attacks is to be 
constantly on the defensive. Life is too full of present 
struggles to warrant exclusive planning for future events. 
It seems reasonable, therefore, to think of education as a 
preparation for life only as one of the conceptions neces- 
sary for a complete understanding of the purposes of 
education. Education utilizes the experiences of the past 
in present situations and when such utilization is wisely 
planned and executed the past and present have combined 
forces to aid the individual in his future social needs. 
The Ends of Education 
In a later chapter a discussion of the purposes of formal 
education is offered as a stimulus to further thinking. 
Here, we are chiefly concerned with the general theory 
of education as it exists everywhere. To answer this 
question is to presume upon the rights of philosophers. 
It is easy enough to say that the ultimate end of educa- 
   
-P-A-G-E-200
  186 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
tion is to create conditions leading to a fuller and richer 
life. That forces us to a consideration of life. What 
are the elements which constitute the richer life? Happi- 
ness? What is happiness? These are questions each indi- 
vidual must face for himself. One must not face the 
questions, then turn one’s back upon them—least of all, 
the successful teacher. Each must formulate the answers 
for himself. Others may assist in clarifying certain fac 
tors which may contribute to temporarily satisfying 
answers but ultimately the major issues of life must be 
settled, as far as settlement is possible, by each individual. 
The teacher owes it to the lives he influences as well 
as to himself to seek answers early to the fundamental 
problems of education. 
Education as a Family Function 
In an earlier chapter we have considered the relation 
of the family and the school. Here we need to approach 
family obligations to education from another angle. Since 
the child from birth is a learner the family assumes defi- 
nite educational responsibilities from the outset. Habit 
formation, modifications of behavior, creation of desirable 
attitudes and ideals, development of special abilities, 
these and other ways of expressing changes in the child’s 
life are the never-ending obligations’ of the family in mat- 
ters educational. 
Education as a Church Function 
Religion is one of the most deep-seated factors of 
human life. The child first. wonders, then admires, then 
respects, then reveres, then worships. Environmental 
conditions usually aid in this natural process. Children 
are directly or indirectly influenced by the religious life
-P-A-G-E-201
A DISCUSSION OF EDUCATION 187 
about them, and since the church is a symbol of religious 
expression it assumes a responsibility in the education 
of all who live within its circle of influence. To the 
impressionistic child this obligation of the church becomes 
a matter of serious consideration. The orthodox virtues 
of truth, piety, honor, tolerance, love, and so on, each 
demand in the name of religious education a treatment 
free from prejudice, fear, hypocrisy, and superstition. , As 
long as the church maintains its exalted place in com~- 
munity life, so long will its worth be in part judged by 
the way in which it discharges its obligations to education. 
Education as a State Function 
No unit of government in this day of complex civiliza- 
tion is sufficient unto itself. The small community, if 
isolated for a short time, would perish. Even a great 
state, if cut off from the outside world, would soon suffer 
beyond description. Into New York, the wealthiest state 
of the Union, are shipped grains from the west, cotton 
products from the south, sugar, rice, spices, and other 
food products from foreign lands, oil from the southwest, 
coal from Pennsylvania, and mineral resources from all 
over the world. If New York State were deprived of the 
necessities of life supplied from other regions the people 
would die by the millions in a relatively short space of 
time. Economically, communities are interdependent. 
Socially, they are equally interdependent. Modern trans- 
portation facilities and modern means of communication 
have eliminated distances to a large degree. So in this 
country not only is education a state problem but an 
equally important national problem. The functions may 
differ but the responsibilities for the promotion of educa- 
   
-P-A-G-E-202
ee Te Tenn em ye 
188 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
tion are inextricably interwoven. As national boundary 
lines melt, economically and socially, education becomes 
of greater and greater importance. Even now education 
is an international problem. Its importance as such is 
recognized by the recent action of Columbia University 
in creating an Institute of International Relations. This 
movement is only one of many to make education function 
internationally. Education is rapidly becoming a state 
function in the broadest sense of the term. 
The State itself has no higher function than to further 
human development and happiness by means of education 
designed to enable each of its members to approximate 
its spiritual and mental potentialities.*

CHAPTER XI 
THE PURPOSES OF EDUCATION 
Two visitors in New York City decided that as a part 
of their sight-seeing ventures they would walk across the 
famous Brooklyn Bridge. Accordingly they boarded a 
subway train in upper Manhattan which would carry them 
to a station stop in Brooklyn from which point they could 
return by foot over the above-mentioned route. Being 
unacquainted with the subway stations they went farther 
than was necessary. However, upon gaining the surface 
they retraced their way in the proper general direction 
until the approach to a bridge was seen. Upon reaching 
a point of vantage on the bridge they discovered Brooklyn 
Bridge some distance below them. They were crossing 
Manhattan Bridge instead. Inasmuch as walking across 
one of the huge East River bridges was satisfactory for 
their general purposes, the two proceeded and arrived at 
their next objective, the lower east side of New York. 
The general aim was realized. This would not have 
happened, except by accident, if there had not been a 
conscious purpose from the beginning of their trip, as an 
impelling force toward a definite achievement. 
The same principle applies in all phases of life. No 
one seriously leaves all desired achievement to the whims 
of chance. There must first exist the recognition of the 
problem, then the subsequent action necessary to realize 
the end sought. 
190
-P-A-G-E-205
| THE PURPOSES OF EDUCATION 191 
In recent years the appeal for life or practical applica- 
tion in educational endeavor seems to be unusually in- 
sistent. In understanding the purposes of education lies 
the first step. An objective is the ultimate end toward 
which all effort is directed. The aim is the general direc- 
tion by which we reach the goal for which we strive. The 
purpose is the casual force impelling the resulting aim 
toward the objective. For example, in target practice, 
the bull’s-eye is the objective. The direction of the gun 
barrel, due to the manner of holding the weapon, consti- 
tutes the aim, and the desired high score may be consid- 
ered the real purpose, explaining the cause of the per- 
formance. A deeper purpose may be found for the 
energy, time, and expense thus involved if sharp-shooting 
can be justified for other than a sportsman’s accomplish- 
ment. Objective, aim, and purpose are terms frequently 
used synonymously in educational circles so that fine dis- 
tinctions may be out of order in our practical needs. 
An examination of the statements of aims commonly 
discussed by present-day writers may be apropos at this 
point in our study. Yocum in his treatment of this 
topic has developed the social end of learning in a fivefold 
manner. These are listed as vital, civic, vocational, avoca- 
tional, and moral-religious efficiency. An analysis of 
these terms seems desirable if the meaning is to function 
in our interpretation of the purposes of education. 
Vital Eficiency.—Vital efficiency is that ability to take 
one’s part in the daily activities of life unfettered by any 
physical disadvantage. It is because of this desired end 
.that the work in health education has been so emphasized 
in recent years. In colonial times health was to the 
pioneer largely an individual problem. The settler ate  
-P-A-G-E-206

192 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
plain food, wore coarse clothing, enjoyed regular sleeping 
hours, unless disturbed by the savage, and so developed 
| a physique quite immune to the ill effects of many forms 
of hardship. Because of the widely scattered population, 
regulations regarding sanitation were unnecessary. Only 
as people formed themselves into large and more congested 
groups did a consciousness arise of the importance of 
health as a community problem. So in proportion to 
population densities this question received public atten- 
tion until to-day it may be truly said that health is a 
national problem. It is obvious that in our large cities 
where thousands live and work in one block that each 
must consider the safety of the other for his own sake 
as well as for the sake of the group. 
The result of this realization of health as a national 
question is manifested in the existence of our Pure Food 
Commission, quarantine laws, garbage disposal, and the 
like. The numerous bills before state legislatures and 
before our national Congress providing for the expendi- 
ture of large sums for the prevention of disease and the 
promotion of health education, appropriations made for 
medical and dental inspection, and, in many cities, for 
free medical and dental clinics in the public schools—all 
these are indicative of the immensity of the problem, af- 
fecting our 110,000,000 people and the thousands annu- 
ally flocking to our shores. 
Statistics reveal the actual health conditions of our 
country. For instance, the army examinations during the 
World War disclosed an alarming percentage (24.9 per 
cent) unfit for military service. It must be remembered 
that the requirements for military service are more strin- 
gent than for civil service. Nevertheless the two forms of  
-P-A-G-E-207
  THE PURPOSES OF EDUCATION 193 
activities are not wholly divorced with respect to physical 
disabilities. It is also to be remembered that 90 per cent 
of those rejected by the examiners of the draft boards were 
afflicted with preventable bodily disorders. Health and 
physical fitness are clearly of national importance. 
Civie organizations without official connection, legally 
constituted health authorities, and public and private 
schools are working earnestly to meet the exigencies of 
the situations as they are found. It is perforce a con- 
tinuous struggle and for this reason health education de- 
mands a fair share of attention from curricula makers as 
well as from law makers. 
Physical education and health education are so inter- 
related that one cannot be mentioned without an in- 
ference of the other. So-called physical education pre- 
ceded what is known in New York State as health educa- 
tion. Yet because of their similarity and identity of 
purpose there can be no legitimate quarrel between the 
ardent advocates of each. 
Major college athletics, for example, football, basket- 
ball, baseball, and track, and calisthenics and gymnastics 
are commonly justified on the side of physical training 
for the sake of health improvement. Proper ventilation, 
food values, care of the body, and so on, constitute the 
usual interpretation of health education for the sake of 
the physical being. Thus we find our schools emphasizing 
both interpretations and for a common cause, namely, that 
the individual may act his part in society without unnec- 
essary hindrance from the standpoint of bodily ability to 
accomplish the tasks to be performed. 
Cwie Efficiency—The term “citizenship” is shopworn 
and somehow too vague to satisfy our more exacting 
   
-P-A-G-E-208
a a A a i ae eae 
194 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
search for an adequate expression of aims in education. 
Yet with elaboration it becomes more acceptable and un- 
derstandable. True citizenship implies an adequate 
knowledge of human relationships, an appreciation of the 
trend of events, and the power of contributing con- 
structively to the realization of a more highly developed 
civilization. It means, in its most complete sense, “ever- 
increasing and widening circles of shared interests.” 
Such a conception rightly starts with the individual, then 
extends to the family, then to the neighborhood, the state, 
the nation, and all humanity in the order named. What 
is the individual? An intangible personality composed 
| of native impulses, some of which must be developed, 
others modified, and still others entirely repressed. As 
his original self develops he forms through his contact 
with others an acquired self. In others he sees himself, 
in himself he recognizes others, and gradually personal 
and material relationships take form. Then come prob- 
Jems of expansion in which he first begins to take into 
account those about him every day. These, he learns, are 
the members of his family. It becomes an obligation of 
education, not necessarily of the school, to equip him with 
those characteristics which contribute to a happier home 
environment. Mother and father need help. The child 
becomes increasingly happy in the degree to which he is 
permitted through his own abilities to contribute to the 
general welfare of those about him. 
But other individuals, places, and things attract his at- 
tention. He discovers eventually that there are other fam- 
ilies, many of them, and that a certain restraint is neces- 
sary for the welfare of the group. For instance, he cannot 
disregard traftic regulations, fire protection, laws of sanita-
-P-A-G-E-209
THE PURPOSES OF EDUCATION 195 
tion, school attendance, church and charitable institutions. 
In due time the individual assumes his share of obliga- 
tions in the community life. Again, education determines 
the extent and effectiveness of his participation. 
Then comes an appreciation of the fact that the state 
is nothing more nor less than many communities each shar- 
ing the responsibilities and privileges of united effort. 
And as his vision becomes more inclusive he thinks in 
terms of state problems and then in terms of national 
affairs, all the while dependent upon the results of educa- 
tion. As distances have been diminished by discovery 
and invention he realizes that the world is rather small 
after all and that there is an international relationship 
involving powerful political and economic forces. And to 
his amazement he discerns the human limitations under 
which these international interdependencies exist and may 
himself feel the urge of actively entering into the fulfill- 
ment of an improved state of world affairs. It may be 
noted that the number of those who reach the succeeding 
stages of comprehension become correspondingly fewer in 
number. But this fact only discloses the necessity for 
increased effectiveness in education as the unsolved prob- 
lems unfold before the learner in astounding quantities 
and frequencies. The highest type of citizenship requires 
intelligent manipulation of information toward worthy 
ends, a keen appreciation of human relationships, and a 
consuming desire to play well one’s part in the great 
drama of life. To this ambitious realization the school 
is in a strategic position to direct the activity, to influence 
the thought, and to stimulate the power of achievement 
toward these ends since, in the final analysis, the indi- 
vidual is the starting point of society. Upon him does the 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
i 
196 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
betterment of social, political, and economic problems 
depend. 
Vocational Efficiency. It already appears that these 
aims of education are in a measure overlapping. To be 
an efficient citizen one must be healthy and must assume 
one’s share of responsibility in the material world of pro- 
duction. Vocational efficiency may mean then the ability 
to take one’s place properly in the world of work to the 
end that society in its ever increasing complexity may 
not disintegrate. The individual finds that others are 
dependent upon him for physical existence. He finds that 
to a large extent his own existence rests upon his ability 
to produce. And so he attempts to find a suitable oceupa- 
tion. Unfortunately, at the present time this adjustment 
to economic conditions is largely a matter of accident. 
His father is a farmer and he becomes a farmer too; his 
uncle owns a factory and he naturally becomes a mill 
hand; his neighbor owns a retail mercantile establishment 
and, perchance, the opportunity presents itself in such a 
way that he eventually purchases an interest in the con- 
cern. There seems to have been, in spite of a common 
assumption to the contrary, a guiding providence which, 
if not directing the individual into that vocational activity 
for which by nature he is best fitted, at least endows him 
with an astonishing ability to adjust himself to existing 
conditions. Economists reason that this is an unscientific 
and wasteful process. And that in consequence intelligent 
guidance assists the individual into that vocation where 
his productivity will reach its maximum with a corre- 
sponding maximum of happiness. This, it appears, is one 
of the tasks of education. Once this vocation is deter- 
mined it has become the obligation of education to fit 
 
-P-A-G-E-211
a aaa ar 
THE PURPOSES OF EDUCATION 197 
the individual through increased knowledge, and skills 
to do better those specialized activities of life which are 
to contribute ultimately to the progress of society as a 
whole. The public schools have undertaken this responsi- 
bility. Much has been done but the task is far from 
satisfactorily accomplished. Indeed, the professional 
education of teachers is education for a vocation, as the 
term vocation includes professional work, tradesmanship, 
and business activities of all kinds, reproduction and crea- 
tion in the very real sense that common and skilled labor, 
creative intelligence, and directive genius all contribute to 
the complex whole of society. 
Avocational Efficiency. As civilization advanced in- 
dustrial conditions changed accordingly. And, due to the 
tremendous strides in invention, industry became more 
and more concentrated, calling for an increasing amount 
of skilled labor. It was only natural that as production 
increased actual industrial working hours became less. 
This resulted in a very real social problem. What should 
be done with the additional hours of leisure? Tempta- 
tions are many and the tendency to respond to original 
nature, particularly to the undesirable tendencies, makes 
the problem of avocational training more insistent upon 
the attention of educational forces. To offset those traits 
of native origin a more desirable “reaction bond” must . 
be developed. It seems safe to assume that all forms of: 
human conduct deleterious to the welfare of society have 
taken root in idleness. It is here that all malicious and 
vicious deeds originate. This can be remedied if not en- 
tirely cured by substituting for idleness, purposeful and 
worthy activities. 
What are some of the possibilities in this direction? In

athletics we have swimming, boxing, running, rowing, 
golf, football, basketball, baseball, tennis, polo, lacrosse, 
skiing, and many others. In the field of letters we have 
reading circles, libraries, books, magazines, newspapers, 
etc. Entertainment presents itself in the form of lectures, 
concerts, museums, the theater, and the like. Nature steps 
into the foreground with a perfect galaxy of interesting 
things—vegetation in myriad forms, animal life beyond 
the power of the imagination. What is necessary is some 
directing force to point out the various worthy activities 
of life which cannot fail to command the interest of the 
individual to the exclusion of his undesirable tendencies. 
Appreciations, ideals, attitudes, habits, knowledge—all 
these are products of education which constitute the very 
essence of life. Avocational efficiency in ever-incréasing 
potency becomes an important aim of education. It be- 
comes a real community problem, and the good citizen will 
come forward in promoting, organizing, and directing 
such activities to the everlasting benefit of humanity. 
Moral and Religious Efficiency. Religion has become 
decreasingly conspicuous in programs of publicly sup- 
ported institutions of learning in this country. The rea- 
son is obvious. Not the decreased consciousness ‘of the 
fundamental place in the life of the individual and society 
of a satisfying religion, but the conflicting dogma that has 
arisen as a result of education has made the external ex- 
pression of religious tendencies too controversial for pub- 
lic solution. Other agencies than the public schools are 
specifically designed to continue religious training as is 
commonly understood. The real truth of the matter is 
that education cannot avoid fundamental religious prin- 
ciples, such as, for example, “the brotherhood of man.”
-P-A-G-E-213
EE 
THE PURPOSES OF EDUCATION 199 
It is in this connection and for reasons just stated that 
the so-called religious teaching has given way to so-called 
moral training. Since morality and social development 
are concomitant, morality as an aim of education merges 
with the social development of the human race. Stand- 
ards of morality vary according to conditions, and, as 
education effects changes in the social order, morality in 
its true meaning is inevitably affected. 
Bagley expresses the summation of his stated aims of 
education in the term social efficiency. By this he means 
(1) an individual capable of “carrying his own load,” 
(2) so equipped that he will “interfere with others as 
little as possible,” and (3) that he may, by reason of his 
educational accomplishments, contribute as far as possible 
to “the assistance of others.” Into this general statement 
of the aim of education Yocum’s fivefold classification 
very conveniently fits itself. As we understand the terms 
used, vital, civic, vocational, avocational, and moral and 
religious efficiency in their total contribution and in their 
interrelationships constitute “social efficiency.” 
A comprehensive program of action which has stimu- 
lated the thinking of the greatest figures of all recorded 
time and truly a compelling challenge to the enterprise 
and intelligence of those who earnestly desire to realize in 
their own lives and in their relationship with humanity 
throughout the world, the ultimate aim of education— 
social efficiency !   Questions AND Prosiems

  CHAPTER XII 
THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION 
Having inquired into the nature and purposes of educa- 
tion one may then raise the question, “How valuable is 
it?” Having sensed its value one may be tempted to 
define it more accurately. The meaning and importance 
of education are each supplementary to the other. It 
would be quite unusual to meet anyone who would deny 
the value of education. He might qualify his endorse- 
ment by urging the right kind of education, and if you 
were then to ask him what he meant, the probable answer 
would be “By the right kind of education, I mean that 
which insures progress.” Your next thought would be, 
“What is progress?” That is a rather large order, and 
he shifts the responsibility to you. You are primarily 
engaged in the work of education. Teaching is your pro- 
fession. You, a teacher, he argues, are the logical one to 
answer questions regarding the meaning, purposes, and 
value of education. He is right. The teacher should 
have thought through these perplexing problems. But you 
say, “I am only a beginning teacher. I haven’t had time 
to think about these questions very seriously. I have 
been learning how to teach.” If he is extremely courteous, 
he may not reply to your alibi. He will probably ask 
you if you enjoyed the concert last night. But he in all 
probability will think something like this, “Here is a 
201

202 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
teacher. He says teaching is a profession but he doesn’t 
know why he is teaching. The man who found the means 
of exterminating the boll-weevil knew the importance of 
his discovery. The man who found an adequate way of 
combating hog cholera knew why hog cholera was a men- 
ace. Legislation designed to prevent the spread of the 
‘hoof-and-mouth’ disease was founded upon reason. This 
teacher is working with our boys and girls, and in this 
country over a billion dollars is spent annually for public 
education!” And so the cause of public education suffers 
a severe blow. And why? Because you, who so answered, 
have grossly misrepresented the high professional stand- 
ards which as teachers you are bound to uphold. What 
| is the remedy? The beginning teacher is not guilty of 
| intentionally injuring the cause of public education. He 
has merely failed to consider its importance in a thorough- 
going fashion. It is the purpose of these chapters to intro- 
duce the beginning teacher to some of the fundamental 
questions of education—not that complete and final 
answers may be found immediately but that the beginner 
may have no excuse for not attempting to formulate tenta- 
tive answers through not having had the problems pre- 
sented. As has been previously pointed out, education 
is growth, and this theory is applicable to teachers as well 
as to pupils. For in a very real sense we are all students 
and should persist in keeping alive in ourselves the stu- 
dent attitude. 
The Meaning of Progress | 
Progress and change are not necessarily synonyms. All 
matter is in a constant state of change. All matter pos- 
sessing life is in a state of change. Even after life departs 
 
-P-A-G-E-217
   THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION 203 
change takes place. But change may mean retrogression 
as well as progression. When change takes place in such 
a way that a better condition results we have what is called 
progress. In mechanics invention which brings improve- 
ment is a symbol of progress. Progress is usually consid- 
ered in a social sense, and the term as an abstraction has 
little meaning for the vast majority of people. It may 
direct our thinking to consider all quantity and quality 
as being arranged and rearranged on a scale of distribu- 
tion. At the lower end of the distribution we have that 
which is of little relative value and at the upper end of 
the scale is that considered to be of greatest value, and 
all along the scale are located the values of intermediate 
importance arranged in order of their value. In the 
process of change a redistribution of these values is con- 
stantly taking place. If in this process of redistribution 
the relatively valueless is eliminated or relegated to an- 
other sphere of usefulness, according to the Darwinian 
theory of the survival of the fittest, and the new distribu- 
tion begins farther up the line and ends ahead of the 
highest point of the old distribution, then the change has 
meant progress. Imagine a line AB (See Fig. 1) of in- 
finite length. The old distribution begins at M and ends 
at X. The area included by the base line and the curved 
line represents the total number of cases involved. Now 
See B 
~ 
Fig. 1.
-P-A-G-E-218
204 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
if the new distribution of values begins at N and ends at 
Y, assuming that the line of progress is toward the right, 
then it is evident that progress has been made. There is 
a distinct gain measured by the distance between the old 
and the new if the curve and number of cases remain the 
same. The rate at which the redistributions move to the 
right is the rate of progress. 
Progress versus Status 
We have attempted to show that progress means change 
which carries with it betterment, moving up the scale. 
Status is also concerned with change but implies a return 
to the original position on the scale. Progress and status, 
then, are incompatible. In a redistribution of values such 
as was discussed in connection with Figure 1, if status 
prevailed instead of progress the distribution NY would 
be utterly impossible. Any redistribution would settle 
back to MX. Applications of these abstractions will later 
be made to the problems of education. 
Progress and Stability 
It is obvious from the preceding discussion that prog- 
ress cannot be where status persists. Stability is quite 
another matter. Stability means certainty, sureness, de- 
pendability. This may underlie both status and progress. 
In connection with progress stability means, in addition 
to insurance against retrogression, a definite and certain 
trend upward. Without stability progress would be sub- 
ject to dangerous fluctuations. The important questions 
in connection with these last three topics concern them- 
selves with the factors to which education is related. These 
pertinent elements, educationally, will reveal them- 
selves to the careful student as his conceptions of the prob- 
 
-P-A-G-E-219
THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION 205 
lems of life develop to a workable form. We are, as stu- 
dents of education, primarily concerned with the progress 
of humanity, and it is in relation to the needs of mankind 
that our educational theories must take form. 
Social Progress 
Progress in relation to the problems of society consti- 
tute our chief concern. We are interested in materials 
and things only as they affect individual human beings 
or groups of human beings. So it is with ideas and ideals. 
Changing conditions which result in better group life 
spell social progress. As Prof. L. C. Marshall of Uni- 
versity of Chicago has so aptly suggested, we are con- 
cerned in education with the problems of “living together 
well.” It is said that the most difficult thing in the world 
is to live alone, and the next most difficult thing is for 
us to live together. We have no choice; we are inclined 
by nature and forced by circumstances to live together. 
To “live together well” is a generalization for social 
Utopianism. In spite of the advantages of modern civ- 
ilization, there still exist enough disadvantages in group 
life to furnish convincing evidence that a social Utopia 
is far from being a present reality. If we are consistent 
with our idea of growth as an end of education we will 
not think of social perfection as a future reality. Such 
a theory should not discourage effort to create better social 
conditions. We are not chasing a mirage in pursuing the 
ideals of an improved social order. 
The Bearing of Education upon Progress 
If we think of progress as a certainty, we are rationaliz- 
ing a defense for personal and group inactivity which 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
206 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
barely might lead to an improvement of conditions. Why 
strive so diligently if betterment is sure to come anyway ? 
Such a theory is a brand of fatalism which says that what 
is to be will be, and is inimical to the persistent existence 
of conscientious effort. 
The other point of view takes the position that only 
change is inevitable and that progress is dependent upon 
intelligent direction. Since man is supreme and exercises 
increasingly greater control over the forces of nature, it 
devolves upon man so to direct effort that improved social 
conditions will result. Since man does direct and control 
social forces and since man profits most by experiences 
and, also, since the reordering of experiences constitutes 
education, social progress unquestionably must depend 
upon the use man makes of the means of education. This 
theory, contrary to fatalistic belief, spurs us on to ever- 
increasing control of effective means of education. The 
school is a formal agency created to facilitate the processes 
of education. The teacher is the directive force in the 
classroom, and his responsibilities in relation to the big 
problem of social progress through education demand the 
most careful preparation possible. 
Education in an Autocracy 
We have raised the question of the fundamental im- 
portance of education. It will be interesting to note how 
the importance of public education has been considered 
by various social orders. It is fashionable to think of an 
autocracy as represented by the governmental conditions 
of France during Napoleon’s régime or of Germany dur- 
ing the reign of Wilhelm IT or of Russia when ruled by 
the Romanoffs. It is assumed that the term autocracy
-P-A-G-E-221
THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION 207 
is interpreted as a form of government in which unre- 
stricted power rests in a supreme ruler. 
Napoleon openly developed a national system of educa- 
tion in order that his control might not be undermined. 
He prescribed not only content but method and deter- 
mined through a rigid press censorship what criticisms of 
his system of education should appear before the people 
of France. 
The German Kaiser (Wilhelm IT) combated the influ- 
ence of socialism and communism through the public 
schools so that theories of social democracy would not 
endanger the power nor thwart the purposes of the House 
of Hohenzollern. 
Under the caste system of Russia each child received 
such training as would render him contented in that rank 
of life to which he had been born. Continual contentment 
meant the perpetuity of the principles underlying Rus- 
sian government at that time. 
These examples are offered only as evidence of a uni- 
versal recognition of the power of public education. The 
ends which education is sometimes compelled to serve may 
well be called into question, but the power of education re- 
mains whether the ends justify the means or not. We are 
here reminded of the problem of determining the right 
kind of education. 
Education of the Masses 
The elemental principles underlying democracy and 
autocracy are so vastly different that educational institu- 
tions under each as represented by a form of government 
would necessarily assume quite different aspects. Where 
the autocratic power of an individual or a small group of 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
  
  208 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
individuals is exercised the perpetuation of autocracy 
through various educational agencies, including the public 
school system, is much more simple than where policies 
are determined by the many in the interests of the many 
instead of for the purposes, selfish or unselfish, of the few. 
It can scarcely be denied that results are secured more 
readily and probably with less effort under a dictatorial 
régime. Democracy is essentially concerned with the 
nature and permanency of results, and the methods em- 
ployed will be shaped in accordance therewith. If some 
autocratic power, as paradoxical as it seems, were to 
direct the development of democratic ideals through edu- 
cation it is possible that democracy would flourish earlier 
than it will otherwise. But that is not the way of democ- 
racy, and the democratic theory of education cannot sanc- 
tion autocratic methods. Not only the ends sought but 
the means used must conform to democratic standards if 
the ideal is to be substantially approximated. 
It has been suggested that under democracy education 
takes a different form from that found in an autocracy. 
It is somewhat difficult to illustrate that point since there 
exists at the present time no pure democracy. One dif- 
ference in the two theories seems to be obvious in study- 
ing the Prussian system of education under Wilhelm II 
in connection with the conception of “love of country.” 
The teaching in the schools stressed the advantages of 
kingship and omitted the disadvantages. And democracy 
was discussed only as an impracticable theory so far as 
government was concerned. In a system of education 
conducted along democratic lines, all forms of government 
would receive exhaustive treatment and the evaluation of 
each would rest with the individual.  
-P-A-G-E-223
THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION 209 
How important popular education is in a country aspir- 
ing to democratic standards was well stated by Woodrow 
Wilson: 
Popular education is necessary for the preservation of those 
conditions of freedom, political and social, which are indispen- 
sable to free individual development. And, in the second place, 
no instrumentality less universal in its power and authority 
than government can secure popular education. . . . Without 
popular education, moreover, no government which rests upon 
popular action can long endure. The people must be schooled 
in the knowledge and, if possible, in the virtues upon which 
the maintenance and success of free institutions depend. No 
free government can last in health if it lose hold of the tradi- 
tions of its history, and in the public schools these traditions 
may be and should be sedulously preserved, carefully replanted 
in the thought and consciousness of each successive generation. 
Another expression of the importance of education for 
all in a democratic state is aptly put by Samuel Gompers, 
President of the American Federation of Labor: 
It is not enough to have understanding and good education 
among a few; what we require is good understanding and good 
education en masse. We must in the mass understand the 
problems with which we must deal as a democratic people. We 
can advance and develop democracy but little faster than we can 
advance and develop the average level of intelligence and knowl- 
edge within the democracy. That is the problem that confronts 
modern educators; that is the problem that confronts democracy 
itself. 
The significance of education was recognized by the 
early builders of our republic. Thomas Jefferson did 
more than any single man of his time to encourage educa- 
tion for the masses. Our present systems of education 
which are administered through state and local control 
bear testimony to the plans which he so ably and so
-P-A-G-E-224
  ’ 
210 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
wisely advocated. James Madison said, “People who 
mean to be their own governors must be educated.” And 
so on from the beginnings of our organized government to 
the present do we find national leaders testifying to the 
importance of education as some particular national prob- 
lem arises. Theodore Roosevelt touched the keynote of 
the question of the amalgamation of the different nationali- 
ties in this country when he said: 
You teachers—and it is a mere truism to say this—you 
teachers make the whole world your debtor; and of you it can 
be said, as it can be said of no other profession save the pro- 
fession of the ministers of the gospel themselves, if you teachers 
did not do your work well, this Republic would not outlast the 
span of a generation. 
Moreover, as an incident to your avowed work, you render 
some well-nigh unbelievable services to the country. For in- 
stance, you render to this Republic the prime, the vital service 
of amalgamating into homogeneous body the children of those 
who are born here and of those who come here from so many 
different lands abroad. You furnish a common training and 
common ideals for the children of all the mixed peoples who 
are here being fused into one nationality. It is in no small 
degree due to you, and to your efforts, that we of this great 
American Republic form one people instead of a group of jarr- 
ing peoples. The children, wherever they have been born, where- 
ever their parents have been born, who are educated in our 
schools side by side with one another, will inevitably grow up 
having that sense of mutual sympathy and mutual respect and 
understanding which is absolutely indispensable for working 
out the problems that we as citizens have before us. 
In the Baltimore Bulletin of Education, November 
1923, we find this statement which very well summarizes 
the topic of education in a democracy: “The business of 
education is democracy, and the business of democracy i is 
education.”

Endorsements of Education and the Public Schools 
We have quoted H. G. Wells before in connection with 
what good schools and good teachers can do. With refer- 
ence to the subject under consideration in this chapter 
he says: “Human history becomes more and more a race 
between education and catastrophe.” 
Following are quotations from various sources to indi- 
cate the universal understanding and appreciation of the 
value of education and good schools: 
Good schools do pay! They pay enormous dividends in 
things that are lasting and that mean most in the Nation’s 
real advancement. Not only do they pay a people in such 
measurable qualities as literacy, intelligence, and greater earn- 
ing power, but they pay even greater dividends in unmeasured 
values. A good school system offers to everyone who will take 
it the intellectual heritage of the ages; it frees him from the 
grip of superstition and fear; it enlarges his interests; it 
deepens his appreciation for beauty, for truth, and for man- 
kind; it inspires him with a desire for service; and gives him 
power to carry out this desire. 
Can any institution promise more?* 
Epucation as an Asset To Success 
No matter what a man’s work is he can do it better if he is 
well informed. And the point here is that education, while 
it has a larger bearing than a mere preparation for one’s trade 
or profession, is the very best equipment for any sort of 
efficiency. 
Whatever your peculiar calling, your expertness is more 
telling if it rests upon a basis of general culture. 
As a stenographer you will do better work and your chances 
of advancement are much greater if you are familiar with 
history, know your Shakespeare, and are not in doubt as to 
whether Botticelli is “the name of a cheese or a violin.”

212 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
As a lawyer, doctor or preacher, your reputation will very 
likely rest as much upon your “all aroundness,” your wide 
acquaintance with the inside of great books and the general 
impression that you are not a narrow-minded specialist as it 
will upon your technical finish. — 
Culture means intellectual background. 
It means accumulated force behind your stroke. 
It means that you are not only capable yourself, but that 
you know how to absorb and use the capability of wiser persons. 
It gives you perspective. 
It increases your personality. 
It strengthens your influence. 
It keeps you from settling down to become a mere cog in the 
wheel, a little specialized piece of machinery to do a certain 
task, and makes you a Human Being, alive, vibrant, radiating. 
It makes you Somebody, not just Anybody. 
Many a mother has realized too late that she has no hold 
upon her children because of her lack of knowledge. They 
have grown up and got away from her. 
Many a man has risen in the business world only to be hu- 
miliated because he has neglected to acquire that education 
which alone would qualify him to mingle on terms of equality 
with well informed people. 
In fact, no man nor woman who has neglected an education 
does not bitterly regret it sooner or later. 
And no living person was ever sorry that he had secured an 
education. 
There never was an age in the history of the world when it 
was so true as it is now that Knowledge is power. 
And Knowledge is open to Everybody. 
Its gates are unlocked; its door is unlatched; its road is as 
free as the king’s highway. 
The only things that prevent any person from acquiring 
useful knowledge are laziness, self-indulgence, weakness and 
procrastination. 
Even if you did not get a chance to go to school, or if you 
failed to improve your opportunity when young, you can still 
set out upon the royal road to Education if you have the will. 
And even in the case of those who are college graduates, 
the best part of their education is acquired from their studies 
in the ten years after leaving school.

There is no single thing so essential to Success, in whatever 
ealling, as Education.’ 
. . . of all the Men we meet with, nine Parts or ten are what 
they are, good or evil, useful or not, by their Education.* 
EprroriaL: Tue Ricuts or Cuipren 
Former Commissioner of Education Claxton thinks that chil- 
dren have rights, and he outlined some of them in an address 
before a body of teachers as follows: 
“The first right of every child is to be well born. He has 
further, 
“The right to a good name; 
“The right to health and physical vitality ; 
“The right to a joyous childhood; 
“The right to induction into an understanding of literature, 
scientific knowledge, the arts, governmental procedure and 
religion.” 
It is not a very imposing list and yet it calls for the finest 
codperation between the home, the school, the church and all 
of organized society outside of these three great branches. 
If these rights were secured to every child in this generation, 
not only would childhood itself benefit and flourish, but all the 
problems of coming generations would be astonishingly simple. 
A Crren’s EpucatTionaL CREED 
I believe that education is the strong defense of a free nation, 
and that ignorance is a curse to any people. I believe that the 
free public-school system of the United States is the best guar- 
antee of the rights vouchsafed to us by the Constitution. I 
believe, further, that the public schools of the land are the 
eradle of our democracy, and that in the classrooms and upon 
‘the playgrounds, where the sons and daughters of the street 
sweeper and railroad magnate, of day laborer and multi- 
millionaire, meet upon an equal footing and stand upon their 
own individual merits, the lessons of democracy and fraternity 
are best taught. I believe that the hope of America is in her 
youth, and that the battleground of the world is the heart of

Dors Epucation Pay? 
Does education pay? What a question! 
Does it pay to prepare the ground before sowmg the seed? 
Does it pay to polish the precious stone before putting it on 
the market? 
Does it pay to plane and sandpaper the board before putting 
it into the piece of furniture? 
Does it pay to sharpen the tools before working with them? 
Does it pay to know things rather than live in ignorance? 
Does it pay to have a mind rather than be a mere animal 
and be directed by those who have minds? 
Does it pay to think, and if so, to think with a trained 
mind rather than with an untrained one? 
Does it pay to be a leader rather than a follower? 
Does it pay to make the most of the faculties God has en- 
dowed one with, or to let them lie dormant? 
Does it pay to be one of the capable of the human race or to 
be one of the inferior? 
Does it pay to prepare one’s self to do large things or to 
remain satisfied to do small things and let others take the 
advanced positions? 
Does it pay to take advantage of opportunity and make the 
most possible of one’s self? 
Does it pay to get an education? Only the lazy and the 
ignorant answer “no.” 
Pay? Surely it pays—many fold. There can be no better 
investment nor one anywhere near so good. 
Let no youth be deceived. Ask those who are educated. Ask 
the wise of any generation. Be sensible. Get the education 
while you have the chance. Prepare to live a happy and a 
prosperous life.*

THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION 215 
Material Values of Education 
How education has helped a single State, North Caro- 
lina, is shown by facts stated in one of the series of lectures 
on current events prepared by the Review of Reviews Edu- 
cational Department, December, 1923. The position is 
taken that until state-wide constructive educational policies 
were introduced the state exhibited all of its backward 
tendencies. The following gives an index of the intensity 
with which North Carolina attacked the problem of public 
education : 
In the year in which Aycock was elected Governor, less than 
$1,000,000 was expended for all educational purposes. In 1910 
expenditures had increased to more than $3,000,000, and during 
the present scholastic year they will exceed $23,000,000. The 
value of public school property has risen from $5,862,969 in 
1910 to more than $35,000,000 at the present time. During 
the past year, local communities of their own volition have 
invested $21,000,000 in public education, and during the past 
three years have erected new school houses worth $25,000,000. 
There will soon be available a state fund of $5,000,000 for the 
building of school houses, from which counties can borrow for 
a period of twenty years at 414 per cent interest. 
Rural school consolidation, compulsory school at- 
tendance, expansion of higher education facilities, negro 
education, adult illiteracy, improvement of agricultural 
conditions through the building of good roads, ete., are 
some of the problems which have in the attempts to solve 
them brought a backward state into prominence. 
In the American Review of Reviews an article entitled 
“Education and the Future of the Filipinos,’ by Dr. O. 
Garfield Jones, pays tribute to the vast influence of the 
public schools in the Philippine Islands: “There can be 
no enduring democracy without a literate citizenry and

without a political training which comes pay from local 
self-government.” 
One could multiply illustrations indefinitely showing 
material values of education to economic and political or- 
ganizations. Two more quotations will serve to indicate 
the value of education from a slightly different angle. In 
the educational magazine, Normal Instructor and Pri- 
mary Plans, appeared the following: ® 
Tue Cottece Man anp Success 
The college man’s chances for eminence are 870 to 1 as 
against those of the non-college man, according to the report 
of Prof. A. Caswell Ellis to the United States Bureau of 
Education. Although less than 1 per cent of Americans are 
college graduates, he finds that this one per cent has furnished 
55 per cent of our 58 presidents, 36 per cent of the members of 
Congress, 47 per cent of the speakers of the House, 54 per cent 
of the vice presidents, 62 per cent of the secretaries of state, 
67 per cent of the attorneys-general, 69 per cent of the justices 
of the Supreme Court. Professor Ellis took 15,142 names of 
successful men out of the encyclopedia and divided them into 
groups and found that 277 times as many college men had 
amassed wealth as had non-college men. 
The Council of Church Boards of Education in 1919 
issued a pamphlet for the use of colleges from which the 
following quotations are taken: 
Epucation Increases Propuctive Power 
Massachusetts gave her citizens 7 years’ schooling. 
The United States gave her citizens 4.4 years’ schooling. 
Tennessee gave her citizens 3 years’ schooling. 
Massachusetts citizens produced per capita $260 per year. 
Citizens of the United States produced per capita $170 per 
year.

evidence but merely as indications of material values in education.

Tennessee spent $1,628,313.00, or $4.68 per pupil, on educa- 
tion during the same year. 
That year Massachusetts citizens produced on the average 
$144 each more than did Tennessee citizens, or a total of 
$403,969,824.00 more than Tennessee. 
If Massachusetts gives $12,000,000 more to schools and her 
better educated citizens produce $403,000,000 more per year, 
how much profit does that state make on her investment in 
education ?

  220 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
This education required 12 years of school of 180 days each, 
a total of 2160 days in school. 
If 2160 days at school add $20,000 to the income for life, 
then each day at school adds $9.02. 
The Child that Stays out of School to Earn Less than $9.00 
a day is Losing Money, Not Making Money. 
In connection with a discussion on the importance of 
education, the following statements with reference to the 
cost of education in this country are interesting: 
It costs everybody about three cents a day to send a boy to 
school, but a good boy is worth it.’ 
For every dollar we spend on schools we spend two dollars 
for tobacco.” 
Racing and joy-riding cost us three times as much as edu- 
cation and are more precarious.” 
The cost of public schools represents a levy of less than 
one-half of one per cent on the national’s total wealth and re- 
quires less than two per cent of the nation’s annual income.” 
While it is true that the educational budget has increased 
more rapidly than the population, it is not true that it has 
increased more rapidly than the wealth of the community. On 
the contrary, it may be affirmed, with little fear of contradic- 
tion, that from the economist’s point of view the growth of 
prosperity in the United States as a whole has been so enormous 
as to make the proportion of educational expenditures to the 
real wealth of the community actually smaller than it was in 
past decades.* 
The present cost of public education in the United States 
is less than ten dollars to each citizen, and less than fifty 
dollars a year is spent for each child in average attendance. The 
present Federal, state, county, and local taxes for all other pur- 
poses are about seven and one-half billion dollars. This is 
about fifteen times the cost of teachers’ salaries. To double 
the cost of teachers’ salaries, therefore, would only add one 
  at

dollar to every fifteen of present taxation. To double the ex- 
pense of education would only add one dollar to every seven 
and a half. The cost of running the Federal government for 
1920 was nearly six billions, over ten times the cost of teachers’ 
salaries and almost six times the total cost of education. But 
of this vast sum no less than ninety-two and eight-tenths per 
cent went to pay for past and future wars. 
The annual cost of luxuries in the United States is upwards 
of twenty-five billions, or twenty-five times the cost of educa- 
tion and over fifty times the cost of teachers’ salaries. Tobacco, 
for example, in all forms cost over two billions, or twice the 
cost of public education. The last Commissioner of Education 
pointed out that if tobacco users should limit themselves to 
two cigarettes, cigars, “chaws,” or dips instead of three, and 
should apply the savings to the schools, not only would their 
health be improved, but an increase of one hundred and twenty 
per cent could be made in teachers’ salaries. “The people,” 
he said, “ought not to regard the expense of employing teachers 
for their children as burdensome, while it is less than the 
amount they chew up and spit out in tobacco juice, and only 
half the amount they blow away in smoke.” 
Among articles of luxury used chiefly by women, the com- 
bined annual cost of face powder, cosmetics, perfumes, and 
jewelry is not far from one and a quarter billion dollars, nearly 
three times the cost of teachers’ salaries. A saving of one- 
third on this item alone, if applied to school taxes, would enable 
the cost of teachers’ salaries to be nearly doubled. 
The cost of public education in New York is almost negligible 
in comparison with other costs, or with the wealth or income 
of the people. The total school expenses for 1919 were a little 
over ninety millions, and the present annual cost is approxi- 
mately one hundred millions. The total of Federal, state, 
county and municipal taxes for 1920, for all other purposes, was 
about eighteen times the cost of education, or nearly two billions, 
and about twenty-five times the cost of teachers’ salaries. The 
Federal tax bill of New York for 1920 was one and one-half 
billions, or twenty times its school bill for 1918. The total 
cost of public education in 1919 doubled and added to the 
total tax bill for 1920 would add only one dollar in eighteen. 
The salaries of teachers doubled would add only one dollar in 
twenty-five. 
 
-P-A-G-E-236
222 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
The people of New York pay at least twenty-five times as 
much for luxuries as for public education. Indeed, they pay 
more for luxuries in one year than they have paid for education 
in all their history. Doubling the salaries of New York teach- 
ers would add only one dollar in sixty dollars to the New 
Yorker’s bill for luxuries and taxes. Doubling all expenses 
for education would add only one dollar in forty-three. Tobacco 
costs New Yorkers annually fifteen million dollars or more 
than three times teachers’ salaries. Cosmetics in 1920 cost 
more than the entire expense for education in 1917.” 
These facts are not only significant in relation to the 
problems of a democracy but answer objections to in- 
creased expenditure for public education in the light of 
its accredited value. 
It is significant that students of the negro problem in 
this country agree that the emancipation of the negro de- 
pends upon the amount and kind of education which the 
negro population assimilates. History bears witness to 
the effect of education upon the progress of races and of 
nationalities. There can be no other answer than educa- 
tion and more education to the complex question of social, 
political, economic, and religious life. Education is the 
salvation of mankind.

CHAPTER XIII 
IDEALS IN EDUCATION 
From the standpoint of the psychologist the term ideal 
is rather indefinite. Just what it is is difficult to deter- 
mine. Just what effect it has upon the nervous system is 
difficult to determine. And yet the general meaning of 
the word is so commonly accepted that its utility is not to 
be doubted. We all have ideals. Each one governs his 
actions in accordance with those ideals, and it may be 
maintained that to an appreciable extent the outcomes of 
our activities may be considered the measure of our ideals. 
Since it is the business of education to furnish us with 
the means, not only of acquiring new and desirable abili- 
ties, but of placing to better advantage in actual practice 
the desirable traits already possessed, we may well con- 
sider the problem of ideals in relation to life and conse- 
quently in relation to education. It will not be the pur- 
pose of this discussion to point out the ideals in education 
because the great body of ideals is in a process of growth 
and each individual will need to establish his own ideals, 
which to be effective must be for the common good. 
Rather, as beginning students in education it is necessary 
to realize clearly the importance of striving, ceaselessly, 
toward the formulation of ideals as guides both in indi- 
vidual lives and in group activities. 
‘The importance of clearly recognized aims has been 
224
-P-A-G-E-239
IDEALS IN EDUCATION 225 
emphasized. The goal toward which we strive determines 
our aim; that is to say, the general direction or trend of 
all our efforts. The traveler in a strange part of his own 
country depends upon (1) his own intelligence, (2) the 
sign-posts along the way, (3) the information given him 
by others, and (4) his own efforts toward accomplishment. 
Excluding idiots and imbeciles, all those reaching the age 
of responsibility possess enough intelligence to read and 
interpret the signs written in their own language and to 
profit by verbal directions when given in the tongue they 
understand. All this, together with a reasonable amount 
of effort, will tend to enable them to reach their destina- 
tion. In life throughout we find the same situation. Our 
goal is our destination. Our ideals are the signboards and 
directive forces along the way. And the facility with 
which we proceed toward the ultimate goal will be in 
direct proportion to the clarity of our ideals. This may 
be as truly said of our intelligence and our effort, but 
here we are concerned primarily with the potency of 
ideals. 
To be more specific let us say that we have as an ulti- 
mate goal in life service for the betterment of mankind. 
Many of us in our childhood dreams have pictured our- 
selves as great benefactors of humanity. While entirely 
laudable as a generalization its realization will be improb- 
able without the help of the factors named above. The 
signs may be less obvious than are those for the traveler 
but none the less existent or definite. They may direct 
one into business activities of one form or another. It is 
worthy of mention at this point that successful busi- 
ness men testify emphatically to the ideal of service 
as a potent factor in business achievement. These signs

of life may result in a selection of professional work such 
as the practice of medicine, law, the ministry, engineering, 
teaching, and the like. Or our activities may be classified 
among the trades. Regardless of the particular occupa- 
tion we may realize our ideal of service if only we recog- 
nize various factors involved such as preparation, length 
of service, position of influence, and ideals attendant. 
Let us assume that we have found ourselves in the pro- 
fession of teaching. Are we to be actuated by a vision 
of service, power, fame, or material wealth? As we have 
already concluded, the profession of teaching can promise 
little more in this direction than a comfortable livelihood, 
and a “nest-egg” laid away for a “rainy day,” such as 
sickness or old age. As much as we in moments of weak- 
ness desire great riches, in our saner thoughts we realize 
that the really great figures of history, with very few 
exceptions, have been those with relatively little or no 
material wealth. In other words, true happiness, the vital 
outcome of life is by no means assured by the mere posses- 
sion of worldly goods. 
For him who seeks fame for the sake of being famous 
we can hold no stronger brief than for the seeker after 
great wealth. Both are chasing “rainbows.” It is not 
difficult to surmise that in our generation there have been 
some of the public figures of the world who may have 
yearned more for fame than for more worthy outcomes 
of life. Judgment should be suspended in individual 
| cases, however, until sufficient facts warrant definite 
opinion. 
Through the medium of great wealth some apparently 
seek power. Fame may also be a big factor in the realiza- 
tion of this ambition. Power in the hands of the un-   
 
-P-A-G-E-241
Ci ee ee es ee ee 
IDEALS IN EDUCATION 227 
scrupulous means ruin for all those who may oppose in 
any measure. Power delegated to him who is primarily 
motivated by other and more intrinsically valuable desires 
may work miracles for the common good. But the power 
which first satisfies the ego seems in no way justifiable. 
Just what, then, entitles an individual to a great place 
among mankind? H. G. Wells names as the six leading 
figures of history: Jesus Christ, Buddha, Aristotle, Asoka, 
Roger Bacon, and Abraham Lincoln. These were so 
classified not because of what they were able to acquire 
for themselves but rather by reason of what they gave to 
the world. Christ gave to humanity the fundamentals of 
the Christian religion—a philosophy which has endured 
about two thousand years and which has brought about 
greater changes in human relationships than any other 
force. Buddha, too, gave a philosophy of life which has 
influenced for the better the lives of millions of people. 
Aristotle by his ability and the resources at his command 
established the principle, and confirmed its validity, of 
ascertaining facts in rendering just decisions. Asoka, the 
only wealthy one of the six named, devoted his life, for- 
tune, and power to the uplifting of the common people. 
Roger Bacon, with all his faults, emphasized the im- 
portance of experimentation, and this influence has prac- 
tically revolutionized the methods of living among civil- 
ized peoples. Abraham Lincoln gave to the world the 
truest and greatest incarnation of the American spirit, 
the spirit of democracy. The whole world loves him and 
reveres his memory, not for what he obtained for himself, 
but for what he did for others. It is significant that the 
criteria for greatness in other cases where such attempts 
are made to indicate outstanding figures, has as the dom-

228 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
inant element the ideal of service for humanity. In many 
cases the realization of this aim in life sooner or later 
brings fame, certainly power in a real sense, and for most 
people the necessities, at least, of life. 
Can it be doubted that the profession of teaching should 
be placed upon other than a humanitarian basis? Let it 
be thoroughly comprehended at the outset of the state- 
ment of the conception of the teaching service that what 
is meant by service is not the snivelling over-sentimental- 
ized variety but the broad-gauged comprehensive type 
which attempts to solve some of life’s problems by a care- 
ful consideration of the fundamental factors involved. 
More precisely, what is needed is not merely a helpless 
wish to serve some one but an energized desire to serve 
humanity as a whole. The former will result in stagna- 
tion—waiting for an opportunity to present itself. The 
latter will cause the individual to search for opportuni- 
ties and then to make the best of them. The former means 
“passive resistance” to activity, the latter active aggres- 
sive resistance to passivity. For those-who choose the 
latter the profession of teaching offers unlimited opportu- 
nities. 
How can the young teacher best strengthen himself to 
enable him better to proceed surely, even if slowly, toward 
the realization of the conception of teaching as service? 
There are three ways. He may rely upon his own 
powers of observation and his own personal experiences. 
If he is unusually keen and if he is fortunate in the kinds 
and frequencies of helpful experiences he may find this 
method adequate. But most of us would not care to rely 
upon this alone. A second means of acquiring equipment 
sufficient to meet the demand of successful teaching is 
 
-P-A-G-E-243
Se ee eee ns ee ee 
IDEALS IN EDUCATION 229 
to depend upon others for guidance. This in itself scarce- 
ly commends itself to the most deserving of the profes- 
sion. The third way is to combine personal experience 
with the experience of others. It is obvious that the life 
span of one individual is too short to permit the exclu- 
sion from our thoughts of the experience of others. The 
more experience we have the more respect we have in 
general for the opinions of our elders who by example 
have convinced us of their sincerity in attempting to solve 
problems which confront us. 
This point may be illustrated by relating an experience 
of a young man who chose the third way. He listened one 
evening to a heated controversy. The participants called 
upon some interested by-standers who freely gave their 
opinions entirely as they were influenced by some of the 
debaters. The most easily observable result was a mere 
increase in numbers of those engaged in the argument. It 
was then suggested that a certain character in the town, 
well-known for his fairness, his clear insight, and his im- 
partial judgment, be called to express his views upon the 
merits of the case. He agreed to meet them the follow- 
ing evening. He insisted upon a complete statement of 
facts from each point of view represented in the dis- 
cussion. When he was satisfied that he had heard all 
sides of the story he stated that he would return the next 
night and review the case, giving his conclusions. The 
young man was very much interested in the whole pro- 
cedure and was present the night that the decision was 
announced. The arbiter in a very judicial manner point- 
ed out the strength and the weakness of the controversy, 
with unusual clarity weighed one argument against the 
other, and finally expressed his convictions about the case
-P-A-G-E-244
EN 
230 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
in the light of the known facts. The whole incident might 
have lost its force with the young man had it not been 
for the reaction of those engaged in the dispute. There 
seemed to be no pronounced inclination to set aside the 
opinion and to resume the argument. The young man 
wondered why this was so. He concluded that here was a 
man of unquestioned integrity, one who could apparently 
consider a controversial problem dispassionately, one 
who insisted upon all sides of a question before forming 
his opinions, and one who in an unbiased and unpreju- 
diced way could evaluate all the factors in the situation. 
His decisions, of course, were respected. The important 
thing in this account was the effect upon the young man 
who had been so absorbed in the whole episode. As he 
thought of the course of events in the case he selected one 
element in the whole situation which seemed to him the 
most important, namely, the desirability of suspending 
judgment until all points of view, all sides of the question, 
all the facts in the case are fully understood. Here then 
was an idea. Fortunately the circumstances resulting in 
the formation of this idea were of sufficient force to bring 
the thought to the young man many times during the next 
few months with the result that he concluded to test the 
plan as a mode of action for himself. After repeated tests 
which invariably brought him satisfaction he accepted the 
idea of deferring decisions until all available informa- 
tion was carefully evaluated, as a principle of life. Thus 
the idea became to him an ideal. Thereafter it was rela- 
tively easy for him to follow that particular line of pro- 
cedure whenever any controversial problem arose. Before 
the acceptance of this idea as an ideal he had, he found 
as he looked over his past experiences, been too easily
-P-A-G-E-245
SN

swayed by prejudices. In other words, pre-judgments, 
that is, opinions held before thinking took place in a se- 
rious way, had been potent factors in his daily relation- 
ships with the problems of life. Not only did the ideal 
actuate him in the direction indicated, but he became 
more and more an influence for right among his asso- 
ciates. 
The tremendous importance of ideals cannot be over- 
emphasized. The beginning teacher needs to acquire them 
as early and as rapidly as possible. It may be that all of 
our ideals cannot be our own in the sense that they are 
ideas satisfactorily tested in our own experience, but there 
are always those whom we admire for one excellent char- 
acteristic or another, and it may be well to observe those 
principles of action which so successfully operate in their 
lives and apply them to our own experiences. In this 
sense we may possess adopted ideals which are effective 
controls in our own lives. 
Another point which the young teacher will do well to 
remember is that ideals in education are not foreign to 
ideals in life. If education means better living, then ideals 
of life must be applied to the everyday relations between 
teacher and pupil. Suppose, for example, the ideal men- 
tioned in the above incident to be applied to classroom 
procedure. What effect would it have upon the teaching 
of history, government, and similar school subjects? Un- 
happily, at the present time the application of such a 
perfectly sane principle might jeopardize the position of 
a teacher in some localities. Here then is an ideal of life 
which needs to be carried into the field of education. 
To be more explicit: it is more or less of a shock to 
the student who learns for the first time that there are his- 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
ERE 
232 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
tory textbooks used in the schools of the North which 
would not be allowed in the schools of the South and vice 
versa, that history textbooks are written from the view- 
point of the socialist, the monarchist, the autocrat, the 
democrat, that religion colors the pronouncements of this 
writer or that and so on. It cannot be denied in some in- 
stances that the authors are sincere in their belief that 
they are writing “the truth, the whole truth, and noth- 
ing but the truth,” yet we are disposed to hold to the opin- 
ion that many of these widely varying emphases are the 
result of prejudice and a consequent unwillingness to 
hear the other side of the story. Hence, while the real 
value of textbooks should not be undermined, it seems 
advisable for earnest students and, above all, earnest teach- 
ers to inquire carefully into the whole question of author- 
ship. Then in teaching, it becomes necessary to discrim- 
inate, in interpreting to the students the different points 
of view, only between this or that side of a discussion 
without unwarranted indoctrination. 
Let us not wander too far from the main point, namely, 
the importance of ideals as controls in human behavior. 
There seems to be general agreement that ideals as well 
as information may be acquired in school, that personal 
experience alone is too hazardous in point of time econo- 
my, that the word of others without contemplation is 
dangerous, but that the right proportions of each are the 
most effective. It then becomes necessary to have as many 
real experiences of the right kind as possible but also 
necessary to make the valuable experiences of others one’s 
own as early and as rapidly.as possible. The beginning 
teacher has a twofold obligation: first to formulate ideals 
for himself, and then from the beginning to help the pupils
-P-A-G-E-247
Se RO ene ee EO NR eT ee ee ee ee 
IDEALS IN EDUCATION 233 
form ideals for themselves. As already indicated these 
ideals are not vague abstractions but actual modes of con- 
duct. One’s ideals regulate one’s associations with others, 
and the cumulative body of ideals constitute his phi- 
losophy. 
Philosophy, then, need have no terror for any one. 
Everyone has a philosophy whether he is able to state it 
or not, and from the point of view of education the sooner 
the individual begins to form his philosophy the sooner 
will he realize a more effective life. This is the never- 
ending obligation of the teacher. 
It was the good fortune of the writer to have as a col- 
league a man who by reason of long experience, power of 
keen observation, a happy faculty of interpretation, and 
an undoubted sincerity of purpose, was able to formu- 
late the following creed. This is an expression from him 
of a philosophy of life, of a philosophy of education. It 
is an expression of ideals in the profession of teaching. 
A study of this creed cannot fail to furnish the student 
with a wealth of material from which to build his own 
philosophy. 
I believe in man’s divinity and its potency to advance the 
individual and society to higher planes of living. 
I believe in a humanized society in which the Christian 
conception of human relations shall be dominant; in which 
all individuals shall have equal opportunity to realize the latent 
capabilities with which they are endowed; in which childhood 
and .youth shall be respected and cherished as society’s most 
valuable asset; in which law shall rule above desire because it 
is for the common good; in which bigotry shall yield to tolerance 
and prejudice to the scientific temper. 
I believe in human personality actuated by good-will and 
sincerity of purpose. I believe in the subordination of personal 
freedom to the public welfare. I believe in intellectual honesty
-P-A-G-E-248
  234 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
| 
and open-mindedness. I believe in work and play, in laughter 
and joy, in happiness and contentment. I believe in the en- 
joyment of beauty in whatsoever field it may be found. I be- 
lieve in the sanctity of the body, in health, in clean living. I 
believe in the banishment of worry, in performing the tasks and 
accepting the gifts of each day as I go through life. 
I believe that the education of youth is the finest of the fine 
arts and that my task as interpreter of life to youth is a great 
trust placed upon me. I believe in the aspirations and en- 
thusiasms of youth. I believe in the power of example. I be- 
lieve in coéperation with all humanizing agencies. I believe 
in patience and perseverance and faith in the final outcome of 
education and of life.* 
In venturing upon a discussion of this excellent creed 
one risks severe criticism. Rightfully, any interpreta- 
tion necessary should be made by its author. Since that 
pleasure is to be denied to most of the readers of the creed, 
a consideration of the author’s meaning may be justifi- 
able on the ground that open discussion is usually bene- 
ficial. Questions, doubts, fears, disagreements may arise. 
TE so, all the better. Here is a crystallization of some of 
the thoughts resulting from a life of rich experience. In 
so far as we are willing and able let us make these ideals 
our own. Thus may be laid the substantial foundation 
of a philosophy of education which may serve as a con- 
trolling factor in future professional work. 
Man’s divinity may raise at the outset a fundamental 
question. The author of the creed undoubtedly at this 
point asserts his belief in a Creator and that his Omnip- 
otent Force is responsible directly or indirectly for the 
existence of all things. In other words, man is a part of 
the Divine plan. But, you will say, so are all other ani- 
mals, all vegetation. What marks “man’s divinity” is not 
+ Richard K. Piez, Oswego State Normal School, June, 1923.   
 
-P-A-G-E-249
IDEALS IN EDUCATION (35) 
his mere being but his power to react to situations to 
the ultimate advantage of others based upon an indefin- 
able something, a divine spark, an inner urge to advance 
the individual and society to higher planes of living. This, 
man alone possesses and when properly utilized is the 
power which has resulted in all recognition of right and 
wrong. 
The Christian conception of human relations is the) 
fundamental philosophy of the teaching of Jesus Christ}, 
the brotherhood of man. The next is a recognition of in 
dividual differences. But it is more than that. It is a) 
firm belief that all individuals are entitled to an equal! 
opportunity to develop their best inherent abilities. For\ 
this adulthood is responsible to childhood that it in turn/ 
may pass on to the succeeding generation a richer, fuller 
social inheritance. When such an ideal is generally ac- 
cepted our resources will be used for the direct benefit of 
youth by means of increasingly better agencies for edu- 
cation rather than by emphasis, as now, upon more in- 
direct advantages such as swine breeding, horticultural 
enterprises, battleships, and so on. 
“Law” as used here has a wider sense than the legal 
term might indicate. There are some things that are not 
done even though human nature tends to act otherwise. 
The reason for the inhibition is the recognition of the 
common good. Where that recognition is supreme, enforce- 
ment of legal measures is totally unnecessary. Unfortu- 
nately an effective framework of government is essential. 
Civilization in this sense is far from the millennium. 
An extreme radical or an extreme conservative frequent- 
ly is a bigot in some way. A bigot cannot tolerate views 
which in any way oppose his own position. Thus we are 
   
-P-A-G-E-250
nm ee Mee nN 
236 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
obsessed. by religious controversies, racial prejudices, dan- 
gerous nationalism, sectional strife, political warfare, in- 
dustrial unrest, and so on. 
Good will and sincerity of purpose may be considered 
the elemental factors in human personality. Nothing 
counts for more than a recognition of sincerity whether 
it be in individual or in group enterprise. This will re- 
sult in the subordination of personal freedom to the pub- 
lic welfare. If, for example, husband and wife according 
to their interpretation of personal freedom mutually agree 
to annul the marriage vow they will pause before acting 
to consider the effect of such liberty if so conceived by 
society as a whole. 
Passing over what is so obvious in its meaning we may 
question the “enjoyment of beauty” in its application to 
school procedure. It clearly indicates the importance of 
the appreciation of the beautiful in music, art, literature, 
human relations, in nature—in short, in anything. There 
is always something beautiful to be found in every situ- 
ation. Sometimes it is not easily discernible, but humanity 
would enjoy its “work and play” more, would be happier 
if the desire to search for the beautiful were better culti- 
vated. 
Here in this creed is another expression of teaching as 
a fine art. The interpretation of life to youth is conceived 
not merely as a grave responsibility but as something 
more: as a great trust, the violation of which to the real 
teacher would be the lowest form of incrimination. 
The dreams, the hopes, the high desires, the ambitions, 
the aspirations of youth united with their enthusiasms 
form an irresistible force in the advancement of civiliza- 
tion. Within certain limits these aspirations are price-
-P-A-G-E-251
rr 
IDEALS IN EDUCATION 237 
less. That limit is well suggested by Kipling’s line: 
“If you can dream and not make dreams your master.” 
At this point the power of example is a close corrollary 
in our consideration of the development of youth. Who 
can deny the strong influence of a dominating person- 
ality? 
By “humanizing agencies” we may conclude that ref- 
erence is made to the home, the church, the state, books, 
lectures, music, art, and the like. The school alone is 
not to be thought of as sufficient. Therefore an ideal of 
humanization agreed upon by all the forces at work touch- 
ing the development of civilization presupposes the high- 
est type of codperation. 
Experience teaches that patience, and perseverance, and 
faith are indispensable—patience when results are dis- 
appointing, perseverance in order that the best accom- 
plishment may ultimately be possible, and faith that right 
will finally win, that the good outweighs the evil, that our 
future rewards will be determined by our degree of use- 
fulness now. In the last sentence is seen the author’s 
attitude toward education and toward life. 
_ The most vulnerable part of the creed as it stands with- 
out explanation is the lack of definition of terminology. 
What is society? Law? Desire? Bigotry? Tolerance? 
Prejudice? Scientific temper? Personality? Work? 
Play? Joy? Happiness? Contentment? Beauty? To 
be sure definition cannot be embodied in creeds except by 
indirection. To know the man is to understand his creed. 
To make the creed useful means to make it in part or 
wholly one’s own. To do this one must define these terms 
for himself. This will be a part of philosophical formula- 
tion. Herein then lies the greatest good.
-P-A-G-E-252
238 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
This creed could be expanded into volumes. This course 
is not one in philosophy but, as previously indicated, is 
intended to emphasize its importance. Hence further dis- 
cussion of the creed is left for the reader. Its inclusion 
in this chapter is to indicate one way of establishing 
early in life a basis of right ideals in education. The 
necessity for ideals as controlling forces in human con- 
duct will be more and more apparent as we appreciate 
the problems of child development as a keynote of hu- 
man progress. — 
Questions AND PropLeMs 
1. State as many principles of your own as you can which are 
more or less regulative in function. For example, one of your 
principles might be: “It is better to tell the truth upon all occa- 
sions.” Build up a statement of principles of that nature which 
really do serve as controls of conduct. 
2. Apply these principles to school and classroom behavior. 
8. When did your philosophy of life begin to formulate? 
‘When did it crystallize into verbal expression ? 
4. Illustrate from your own experience the benefit of having 
a standard of behavior or a code of conduct upon which to 
rely in a crisis. 
5. After reading the professional code of the chapter under- 
take, without aid, to formulate a similar statement for yourself. 
What difficulties did you experience in so doing? What are 
the explanations for the presence of these difficulties ? 
6. What is the place of a philosophy of education in school 
procedure ? 
7. State specific steps to be taken by a beginning teacher in 
building up a code of professional ideals. 
8. Undertake to write such a code.

CHAPTER XIV 
PSYCHOLOGY AND TEACHING 
The purpose of this chapter is to introduce the student 
to the subject of psychology so that he may see its im- 
portance and so that he may be equipped with a knowl- 
edge of the purposes and a general view of the courses 
in psychology which may follow in his preparation for 
teaching. 
Psychology is an attempt to understand the causes and 
processes of human behavior. In so far as it is able to 
measure the elements of human behavior in an objective 
way, psychology is a scientific study. Many of the fac- 
tors of consciousness, that is, feelings, emotions, memo- 
ries, images, and the like are not subject to objective 
study by present means of measurement. Until such in- 
struments for measuring are created and the analysis of 
consciousness makes isolation of its elements possible, the 
study of mental processes, sensations, etc., must neces- 
sarily depend upon judgment alone. When a study of 
characteristics is limited to the utilization of opinion, it 
is known as subjective. The study of psychology, then, 
falls into two divisions, the objective and the subjective 
analyses of human behavior. 
Fortunately, from the scientific point of view, many 
of the reactions of individuals are observable and measure- 
able. It seems most profitable in education to study hu- 
240
-P-A-G-E-255
FE Ne eS aE eS a ee 
PSYCHOLOGY AND TEACHING 241 
man behavior objectively. One should be cautious, how- 
ever, not to neglect the subjective side of psychology and 
one should be constantly on the alert to apply objective 
measurement to elements of human nature whenever pos- 
sible. That means in reality, transferring the subjective 
to the objective. It is not possible that a complete trans- 
fer will ever be effected. Judgment and. opinion should 
remain but their ultimate value will always be dependent 
upon scientifically determined facts. 
Native Equipment 
The human body is a very complex mechanism. It 
contains an infinite variety of elements and their inter- 
relationships are multitudinous. The nervous system, the 
muscles, glands, and other bodily organs all play their 
part in every action. For a brief survey of the mode of 
operation of these various organs and mechanisms in re- 
action to stimuli, it is convenient to think of (1) the 
receiving mechanism, (2) the connecting mechanism, and, 
(3) the reacting mechanism. 
The receiving mechanism is composed of the sense 
organs of the body such as the skin, eyes, ear, nose, ete. 
It should be stated parenthetically at this point that forces 
known as stimuli which produce some bodily activity or 
reaction are not necessarily forces outside the body. Many 
reactions are caused by pain or other sensations as a re- 
sult of some internal organic disturbance. The sense or- 
gans contain ends of nerves which convey the force of the 
stimulus to some part of the central nervous system. 
The central nervous system and its nerve branches lead- 
ing to all parts of the body are known as the connecting 
mechanism. The central nervous system composed of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
rena a ee 
242 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
brain, the mid-brain, and the spinal cord is protected by 
the skull and backbone. This portion of the nervous sys- 
tem acts as a clearing house for all impulses received. 
That is, the nerve fibers or neurones which connect the 
sense organs to the central nervous system may be likened 
to messengers who carry messages from the receiving sta- 
tions (sense organs) to headquarters (the central, nervous 
system). Here countless other neurones act as switch- 
board operators directing the impulse to its proper outlet 
in the reacting mechanism. These reacting mechanisms 
are divided into three classes, muscles, glands, ‘and the 
cortical neurones. The muscles react to produce move- 
ment, the glands to produce chemical secretions for various 
bodily functions, and the cortical neurones to produce 
different states of consciousness. 
The neurones connecting the sense organs and the cen- 
tral nervous system are known as sensory neurones; those 
of the central nervous system are known as central neu- 
rones; and those connecting the central nervous system 
and the reacting mechanism are called motor neurones. 
In brief then we can see the sensory neurones conveying 
the stimulus from the sense organ to the central nervous 
system and from there the directive force is sent by 
means of the motor neurones to the reacting mechanism 
which results, as shown before, in bodily movement, gland- 
ular activity, or some state of consciousness such as im- 
agery, sensation, memory, emotional reaction, and the like. 
This brief outline of the mode of operation of the 
nervous system may leave the impression that the whole 
process is quite simple. In a course in educational psy- 
chology sense organs would merit a careful study so that 
their delicacy of structure would dispel any incorrect con-
-P-A-G-E-257
pale te eee ee 
PSYCHOLOGY AND TEACHING 243 
ceptions of simplicity. Such conceptions will be further 
dispelled in studying the composition and arrangement 
of the nervous system, and the complexity of the react- 
ing mechanisms constitutes another separate study. This 
part of psychology which deals with the form and func- 
tions of the various organs and mechanisms is known as 
physiological psychology. It is essential in forming a 
foundation for understanding the reactions of the human 
body to know the many kinds of stimuli to which it is sub- 
jected. 
Educational psychology undertakes to explain the learn- 
ing process in terms of definite reactions to stimuli. The 
business of the teacher, then, is not only to understand 
human behavior, but also in the light of this understand- 
ing, to so control and direct stimuli that an ever increas- 
ing number of desirable reactions may result. Briefly 
interpreted this means that the teacher needs to be able 
to keenly analyze environment, to be watchful over the 
bodily health of the child in order that the organs and 
mechanisms may properly function at all times, and to 
be capable of evaluating results to the end that social prog- 
ress may, indeed, become a reality. This is the business 
of the teacher and the work of education. Psychology, 
which consciously bears those obligations in mind, is fun- 
damental to successful teaching. To repeat, psychology is 
the study of human behavior and the function of educa- 
tion is the direction of human behavior toward higher 
levels of social efficiency. 
Native Tendencies and Acquired Traits 
By native tendencies we mean those traits, character- 
istics, abilities, and capacities with which we are equipped 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
—————— 
244 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
by inheritance. Activity resulting solely from these in- 
herited tendencies requires no learning. Such activity is 
called instinctive. For purposes of thinking native tenden- 
cies can be contrasted to acquired or learned traits, but for 
all practical purposes the two are inseparable. The sim- 
plest form of learning is the strengthening or weakening of 
native traits. As soon as a modification is made in either 
direction then both native and acquired characteristics 
are in reality in operation. Learning, then, means the 
modification of native reactions. This modification may 
be so radical in character that a new ability seems to 
have been created when apparently little founded upon 
native tendencies, or that the unlearned trait seems to 
have been completely eliminated. Ultimately, however, 
we return to the conception of modifiability and it is 
upon this theory that all learning rests. As an example we 
think of the skilled pianist as having an ability quite 
apart from the inherited traits. As a matter of fact the 
ability to play the piano is an acquired ability but was 
made possible by the formation of certain habits which 
were themselves made possible by native equipment. The 
ability was acquired through learning. Since learning is 
a modification of native reactions and since modifiability 
is possible, we may think of learning itself as a native 
capacity. 
Instinctive Behavior 
A native tendency which in behavior takes a certain 
definite form is called an instinctive activity. These in- 
stinctive activities range from the most simple to the most 
complex. The simpler ones are called reflexes and the 
more complex reactions are known as instincts. Winking,
-P-A-G-E-259
EE ee Sel A ee ee 
PSYCHOLOGY AND TEACHING 245 
breathing, the action of the heart, glandular secretions, 
ete., are examples of reflex activity. There is no sharp 
line of demarcation between reflexes and instincts. Laugh- 
ing, crying, walking, talking, and the like rely more upon 
external stimuli and are therefore more complex in that 
more activity in the nervous system is essential than in 
the case of reflexes. For the most part reflex activity takes 
place outside the realm of consciousness. For example, 
the cortical neurones are not taxed in such activities as 
are involved in the processes of digestion, circulation of 
the blood, respiration, glandular secretion, etc. In the 
case of talking, for purpose of contrasting the two ex- 
tremes of instinctive activity, the process is relatively very 
complex. The child is hungry, let us assume, and crying, 
kicking, biting, rolling on the floor, striking, facial con- 
tortion, ete., have not brought the desired food to relieve 
his hunger. He has learned that certain sounds have par- 
ticular meanings which in a variety of combinations are 
known as words and that words, in turn, in many combi- 
nations express his desires. This conveyance of thought 
through a spoken language is the conventional way of 
securing food to relieve his unpleasant feeling of hunger 
and so he learns to talk instead of performing any or 
all of the other activities mentioned. Vocalization is in- 
stinctive and when modified into the form of language 
represents a complex situation due to all the different 
stimuli, the necessary activity of the nervous system, and 
the reactions attendant in the learning processes brought 
into action in developing a language. 
Just as there exists a wide range in the nature of in- 
stinctive activity so does there prevail a wide range in 
the possible modifications of instinctive activity. It is
-P-A-G-E-260
Le 
246 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
true that by conscious effort the rate of breathing or the 
rate of the heart beat or the amount of glandular secre- 
tion can be increased or diminished, but eventually the 
normal rate will be resumed and so we can exercise rela- 
tively little control over reflex activity. Referring again 
to the acquisition of a language and we see quite differ- 
ent possibilities. One needs only to remember the possible 
variations of the human voice and the differences in gram- 
matical usage observable in his own experiences and in 
those of the many individuals with whom he has directly 
or indirectly been associated, to realize how learning a 
given language may depict the innumerable modifications 
of vocalization. To carry the illustration still further one 
may recall the vast differences found in native tongues, 
such as Chinese, German, French, Russian, etc. It is 
with the possible modifications of instinctive activity that 
education is primarily concerned. That interest is im- 
portant not only with reference to what may be done but 
also regarding how the modifiability may be most effec- 
tively accomplished. Some native reactions need to be 
strengthened and others need to be weakened. Psychol- 
ogy attempts to analyze human characteristics into their 
elements so that by the process of isolation the different 
elemental traits as expressed in action may be identified 
and the more effectively modified. It is according to the 
laws of exercise and effect that instinctive activity is 
strengthened or weakened. The law of exercise is con- 
sidered under two subdivisions—the law of use and the 
law of disuse. The more often a unit of the nervous sys- 
tem is used the stronger become the connecting bonds in 
that unit. Thus it is that an instinctive activity through 
use becomes more readily operative and through disuse 
 
-P-A-G-E-261
PSYCHOLOGY AND TEACHING 247 
is greatly weakened or, for all practical purposes, elimi- 
nated. Typewriting may be used as an illustration. By 
constant exercise of the right kind, a high degree of dex- 
terity in typewriting may be developed and retained. 
Through many repetitions of the same movements the 
muscles employed act with speed and precision. Let a 
long interval of time lapse during which there is no 
exercise of the units of the nervous system used in type- 
writing and both speed and accuracy suffer. This illus- 
tration applies particularly to learned abilities but the 
principles involved apply to instinctive reactions such 
as the more simple forms of vocalization as weeping 
or laughing. A young child tends to weep upon the slight- 
est provocation. For obvious reasons he learns that 
weeping is not “good form” as a regular exercise. Re- 
straint in time greatly lessens the amount and frequency 
of weeping so we may say that the instinct to weep has 
been modified by the learning process which in this in- 
stance operated partially according to the law of disuse. 
In the case of the weeping child there is another im- 
portant law of learning besides the law of disuse. The 
law of effect probably preceded the law of disuse. The 
frequent recurrence of weeping in time became objection- 
able to others in the child’s environment and as a result 
weeping failed to secure the pleasing reactions which may 
have at first attended his weeping. He learned that other 
means must be employed to secure the satisfactions sought 
and so weeping as a means was discarded in favor of more 
successful methods. The instinct, then, was modified not 
only in accordance with the law of disuse but with the 
law of dissatisfaction. 
There is perhaps no more fundamental truth underly-

ing the modifiability of instinctive behavior than the Law 
of Effect. We tend to do those things which result in 
pleasure for ourselves and to avoid those activities which 
annoy or dissatisfy us. These tendencies do not sacrifice 
the welfare of the group to the selfishness of the individ- 
ual. Indeed, frequently we do that for others which 
brings immediate, temporary or prolonged, annoyance to 
ourselves. A person may endanger his life to signal a 
railroad train. If the train is not stopped, hundreds of 
passengers may be hurled to certain death. The individ- 
ual who discovered the danger may be physically crip- 
pled for life as a result of his efforts yet the ultimate satis- 
faction he enjoys in having performed a social service far 
outweighs any physical discomfort or handicap which may 
have resulted. The proof lies in the fact that if he were 
able and a similar situation arose he would act in sub- 
stantially the same way as before and again risk his life 
or seriously endanger his physical well-being. Further 
proof lies in the fact that others, through the experiences 
of the past in which they themselves have had no active 
part, who know full well the possible outcomes, will un- 
hesitatingly undertake heroic feats in order to preserve 
human life or to protect or save property values. It is 
the instinctive tendency to do that which is ultimately 
satisfying and yet maintain a sharp distinction between 
personal satisfaction and what is commonly called indi- 
vidual selfishness. It is a wise teacher who legitimately 
capitalizes in his work the Law of Effect. 
Classification of Instincts 
A useful way to classify instinctive activity is to use 
as a basis the kinds of stimuli which cause innate tend-

I EE ____—_ 
PSYCHOLOGY AND TEACHING 249 
encies to take form in definite reactions. Dr. Arthur I. 
Gates in his textbook, Psychology for Students of Edu- 
cation, has utilized this method of classification as fol- 
lows: 
(1) Instinctive responses to bodily or organic conditions, 
such as eating, drinking, breathing, resting, sleeping, voiding, 
ete. 
(2) Instinctive responses to objects or events in the environ- 
ment, such as gross bodily activities (walking, climbing, etc.), 
manipulation, vocalization, avoiding reactions, overcoming ob- 
structions, mastery, fighting, submission, and collecting and 
hoarding. 
(83) Instinctive responses to the presence and activities of 
other human beings, such as parental behavior, mating be- 
havior, gregariousness, and desire for social approval or avoid- 
ance of scorn. 
Under the third class are included those which are 
commonly considered as the social instincts. These con- 
cern themselves with the major problems of group life. 
The instinctive responses listed under class one and two 
are none the less important because they relate more par- 
ticularly to the individual problems of the child. In fact, 
all native and acquired equipment directly or indirectly 
affects the welfare of the social group as well as the well- 
being of the individual. Much could be written about 
the various instincts of man, but for the present the terms 
used are sufficiently self-explanatory. A course in psy- 
chology would elaborate the whole field of native equip- 
ment and instinctive behavior which, as previously stated, 
is only discussed briefly and in part to the end that the 
importance of further study in this field is amply realized. p 
Habit Formation 
One justification for the consideration of instinctive 
activity in human behavior is that innate tendencies un-
-P-A-G-E-264
ee Le a ee en so Monee cor aire eee 
250 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
derlie all of our conduct. While learned abilities may be. 
remotely or directly related to inborn traits it is quite 
probable that all habit formation or acquired reactions 
has some roots in instinctive characteristics. Well estab- 
lished habits seem to function in a way quite similar to 
instinctive activities. Habits are acquired abilities and 
skills and are the result of le learning. Many habits, such 
as various personal idiosyncrasies, are formed uncon- 
sciously. Conscious formation of good habits of thinking 
and doing and conscious interference with and elimina- 
tion of undesirable habits constitute the keynotes of the 
learning process from the viewpoint of psychology. Bet- 
ter habits in handwriting, reading, computation, walking, 
talking, thinking, manual activities, etc., are the imme- 
diate objectives of teaching. 4 
To summarize one might note the fundamental impor- 
| tance of satisfaction and annoyance as dynamic factors in 
habit formation. Upon these two elements the extent of 
the use of the law of exercise will be determined. An 
activity will be repeated in proportion to its satisfying- 
ness and will fall into disuse through annoyance or the 
substitution of another activity more satisfying. These 
principles apply with approximately equal force to both 
instinctive and acquired characteristics. Such factors as 
recency of practice or exercise and the length of the in- 
terval between practice periods are extremely important 
but depend so far as results are concerned upon the na- 
ture of the elements involved and the differences in in- 
dividual capacities. The basic task of education is to form 
as many desirable habits and to eliminate useless or vi- 
cious habits as early in life as possible. These are elemen- 
tal truths of teaching.

Emotional Behavior 
Emotional reactions fall within the realm of the sub- 
jective. There are theories regarding the causes, general 
activities, and results of emotionalities, but detailed ob- 
jective analysis in this field is not yet a reality. Never- 
theless, emotional behavior is sufficiently well understood 
through subjective studies to merit the most careful at- 
tention on the part of all students of education. 
As was stated earlier in this chapter there are internal 
as well as external sense organs. These are connected with 
the central nervous system and organic disturbances serve 
as stimuli in much the same way as external stimuli. 
There is an important addition to the action of the cen- 
tral nervous system, namely, the action of the autonomic 
nervous system. The nerves of this system are connected 
with motor neurones of the central nervous system. By 
means of these connections the nerves of the autonomic 
nervous systems receive impulses from the central nervous 
system and so in a large measure effect the organic changes 
which cause what we have named sensations. Sensations 
such as some form of indigestion, suffocation, hunger, 
thirst, or muscular fatigue are more subject to relatively 
definite localization and analysis. An emotion is more 
diffuse and more complex than any sensation and may be 
defined as a combination of sensations producing a pro- 
nounced positive or negative reaction, An external stimu- 
lus, such as the sight of a rat, may produce a violent phys- 
ical reaction. This reaction is sent through bodily organ- 
isms and glands by means of the autonomic nervous sys- 
tem producing changes which cause a flood of sensations. 
In the case of seeing a rat, the combinations of sensa- 
tions results in a reaction which we may call fear or loath-

252 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
ing. This general activity is called an emotion. Posi- 
tive and negative reactions are illustrated by joy and sor- 
row, enthusiasm and melancholy, or excitement and lan- 
guor respectively. 
The autonomic system is separated into three divisions 
—the cranial, the sacral, and the sympathetic connected 
with the upper part of the spinal cord and the midbrain, 
the lower part of the spinal cord, and the intermediate 
part of the spinal cord respectively. The functions of the 
cranial and sacral divisions work in opposition to the sym- 
pathetic division. These opposing functions cause differ- 
ent organic and glandular activity and so produce differ- 
ent accompanying emotional states. Fear or anger, par- 
ticularly strong emotions, are associated with the sym- 
pathetic system; pleasurable bodily states accompany the 
action of the cranial and part of the sacral systems; and 
sex reactions are involved with the action of part of the 
sacral system. 
Emotions are varied in kind and intensity. Some people 
are very excitable and others in their reactions to unusual 
stimuli approach stolidity. All degrees of emotionality 
range between these two extremes. Very frequently the 
extremely sensitive individual is unstable. emotionally, 
that i is, if easily moved to excessive laughter he may be 
equally easily moved to tears, and the like. Such a con- 
dition of extreme emotional sensitivity presents a difficult 
problem to the teachers as such extreme states closely re- 
semble mental instability. The unemotional individual is 
much less a problem than the hypersensitive one because 
adjustments to new and complex situations are less difficult 
of realization. In school work the highly emotional child 
finds difficulty in conforming to monotonous routine work   
   
-P-A-G-E-267
  PSYCHOLOGY AND TEACHING 253 
and hence many skills such as are developed through drill 
work are often neglected. Special attention, shorter prac- 
tice periods, and the like must be provided for the emo- 
tionally sensitive if creditable work is consistently ap- 
parent in all educational activities. 
Every one must be familiar with visible expressions of 
strong emotionality. Facial expressions which register 
fear, anger, disgust, horror, anguish, joy, doubt, tolerance, 
and so on are perhaps the best known forms of emotional 
expression. Sudden paleness, flushing, clenched fists, 
smiling, “gritting” the teeth, scowling or frowning, squint- 
ing, unusual opening of the eyelids, and various forms of 
muscular tension are each indicative of some form of 
emotional activity. 
The educational difficulties of excessive emotionality 
have already been indicated with reference to the proc- 
esses of learning. The teacher must be eternally vigilant 
for the emotional child and ever ready with a generous 
variety of devices and changes to meet emotionality in 
its various forms. Another hazard besides the educational 
hazards in thinking and doing is that of endangered health 
conditions. Strong emotional behavior causes irregular 
organic and glandular activities which may result in se- 
rious bodily disorders. It is a common argument that 
worry, fear, anger, excessive excitement, and the like have 
more serious effects upon one’s physical self than excessive 
hard work. There is undoubtedly enough truth in the 
statement to warrant caution in exposing a highly emo- 
tional child to strong external stimuli which too fre- 
quently cause excessive emotional reactions. 
There are, then, at least two strong arguments, the 
dangerous effects on health and the unwholesome effect

254 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
on. intellectual effort and results, either of which should 
be sufficiently convincing that control of emotional be- 
havior is highly desirable. The exercise of such control is 
the problem of the individual afflicted and of the teacher. 
Our emotional behavior like instinctive reactions is val- 
uable if properly directed in their development or thwart- 
ing. Many emotions, even anger or grief, can produce 
pleasant reactions. Satisfaction and annoyance are again 
controlling factors. Undesirable emotional habits are 
as unfortunate as undesirable habits founded primarily 
on inborn tendencies. Emotionality, therefore, can be a 
force assisting in the development of the child or it can 
be an individual and a social menace. The teacher needs 
to be constantly alert for all evidences of emotional be- 
havior. It is one of the most important factors in educa- 
tional procedure. 
The Nature and Kinds of Thinking 
When we are aware of the presence of an object or 
event we say that we perceive it. Our awareness may be 
made possible through any one or more of the sense organs. 
For example, we may hear a dog bark and perceive that 
it is near or far away and not be able to see it. The 
awareness, which affects our consciousness in varying de- 
grees, is known as perception. 
The sight or sound of the dog may recall certain past 
experiences. We may have been threatened, attacked, or 
befriended by dogs. At any rate, the perception results 
in certain very definite ideas or meanings. As we later 
meditate, the ideas or meanings seem to crystallize about 
the central dominant idea or meaning of dog. Thus we are 
in possession of a concept. Percepts are occasioned by
-P-A-G-E-269
  PSYCHOLOGY AND TEACHING 255 
immediate awareness while concepts are groupings, or 
combinations, or summations of meanings. 
The actual brain processes are varied and complex. Suf- 
ficient gain has been made by psychologists in the study 
of perception and conception to warrant the conclusion 
that it is unsafe to think of mind and body as separate. 
Both react upon the other in an amazing manner. It is 
a more tenable position to think of mind as consciousness, 
yet that is far from the actual truth. There are so many 
perceptions which become at once a part of the uncon- 
scious and become useful only when occasion demands, 
such as in the formation of concepts, that it seems quite 
likely that the unconscious outweighs the conscious. How- 
ever, it is the direction and development of the conscious 
with which education is concerned. To return to the re- 
lation of the mental to the physical, one needs only to 
remember the complete penetration into all parts of the 
body of the different nervous systems, the effect of gland- 
ular and organic disturbances upon the nervous systems, 
the control of consciousness through the nervous systems 
of various portions of the body, ete., to realize how com- 
plete is the interrelation of mind and body. One cannot 
understand one without understanding the other. 
In education we are interested in the various kinds of 
thinking, The intricacy of thought processes may be left 
to a course in psychology, but it may be profitable at this 
stage to consider some of the different kinds of thinking, 
since it is the chief business of the educative process to 
stimulate, develop, and direct desirable thinking habits. 
No brief need be held about the importance of thinking. 
It is man’s ability to think which marks his supremacy in 
the animal kingdom. That can be taken as an established
-P-A-G-E-270
  256 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
fact and as justification for no further consideration of 
the importance of thinking. The importance of how man 
thinks is quite another matter from the standpoint of 
education. ‘ 
There is a great variety of characterization of types 
of thinking. A sevenfold classification herein proposed 
may include those with which teachers are concerned. Let 
us consider the following types: (1) reverie, (2) wishful 
thinking, (3) empirical thinking, (4) rationalization, (5) 
critical or scientific thinking, (6) reflective or judicial 
thinking, and (7) creative thinking. 
Reverie is placed first because it is the most common 
form of thinking. It seems impossible that even he who 
has done the most scientific, judicial, and creative think- 
ing, could have escaped reverie. ‘“Day-dreaming,” we are 
wont to call it, or “building Spanish air-castles.” This 
kind of thinking presents many dangers. Because it is the 
easiest form of thinking it may lead into mental laziness 
or slothful mental habits. It seems to have a place in the 
scheme of things and probably furnishes a certain amount 
of relaxation in the form of pleasurable imagination. As 
relaxation, reverie might well be encouraged. As a per- 
sistent habit, it should certainly be discouraged. It seems 
bound to persist and so should be considered as a teach- 
ing problem for serious consideration. 
“Wishful” thinking differs from reverie in that it has 
more direction. Where reverie darts hither and yon with- 
out sequence, relationship, or direction, and often with a 
minimum of meaning, wishful thinking presents a local- 
ized objective. This type of thinking may be caused by 
one’s feelings, sensations or emotions and has little or no 
definite information back of it. One desires to have a
-P-A-G-E-271
I _ Oe, 
PSYCHOLOGY AND TEACHING 257 
certain wish gratified and thinks that certain conditions 
would have such and such advantages or disadvantages. 
There is no sharp analysis and no resulting activity to 
bring about the wished-for ends. This type of thinking 
is but one step beyond reverie and also represents a large 
bulk of our thinking. Most of us indulge in wishful think- 
ing with reference to “the federal government at Wash- 
ington,” the “Japanese menace,” the “negro problem,” 
Catholic and Protestant, Christian and Jew, the tariff, tax 
reduction, good roads, and so on ad infinitum. The futility 
of this type of thinking can best be measured by the re- 
sulting activity on the part of the one who indulges. 
Wishful thinking fails to produce a modus operandi in 
much the same way that reverie fails in the main to 
erystallize into activity. What positive results are ob- 
tained are subject to chance or accident and hence not 
educationally dependable. 
The third type of thinking is that which prevails 
most widely in the so-called world of practical affairs. 
We decide to walk instead of to ride; we will buy Lib- 
erty Bonds instead of “Jim Jeffries” oil stock; we will 
authorize the purchase of a double quantity of retail 
goods; we travel from New York to Chicago via New 
York Central or Pennsylvania or Baltimore and Ohio; 
we wear blue or gray or black or brown; we attend church 
on Sunday or stay at home or go to the park or see a 
baseball game; we decide to be a teacher instead of a 
minister, physician, lawyer, or what not. And so on 
through one daily activity after another in which there 
is the element of decision. In the vast majority of cases 
the decision is made on the basis of our superstitions, 
beliefs, prejudices, and opinions which have for the most
-P-A-G-E-272
  258 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
part neglected careful analysis, well-established evidence, 
and the like. The results are sometimes satisfactory, 
sometimes not. The saving grace of this situation lies 
in the fact that somewhere back of the beliefs prevalent 
there may have existed some careful thought. One has 
thought for the many. If the identity, worth, and pur- 
poses of the one were disclosed to the many this type of 
thinking would be less objectionable. But in case of de 
cision-making without adequate information and reliance 
only upon “hunches,” prejudices, and beliefs, the chances 
of error are as great as those of correctness. This kind 
of thinking in which neither the why nor the how of 
the what is considered is called empirical thinking. 
The fourth type is commonly called rationalization. 
One naturally seems called upon to defend one’s own 
whether it be himself, his child, his ideals; or his opin- 
ions. For the most part one lives day after day without 
running into the need of defending his ideas. But sud- 
denly someone says, “I think your opinion on that sub- 
ject is entirely wrong,” and the result is that you act very 
much as if the attack were physical. You throw up your 
arms to ward off the blows and strike back as often as 
opportunities present themselves and as hard as you can 
under the existing circumstances. What you really do, 
mentally, is to seize upon every good reason available to 
justify your beliefs. You resent the contradiction and in- 
stead of admitting that you are in possible error you 
strengthen your accepted belief by emphasizing all the 
old causes leading up to that belief. This process is known 
as rationalization and as later discussions will indicate 
falls far short of being adequate if measured in terms of 
social progress.
-P-A-G-E-273
O_O ee 
PSYCHOLOGY AND TEACHING 259 
Contrasted to empirical thinking is critical or scien- 
tific thinking. It may deal with either concrete situa- 
tions or abstractions or both, but quite likely with the 
latter. Oritical thinking attempts to answer the question 
why and how. To do so means.breaking the whole into 
smaller and smaller units for purposes of further analysis. 
In a later chapter a more extensive treatment of the 
scientific method can be found which can be applied to 
the process of critical thinking. The critical thinker may 
be confronted by such a question as “Which political 
party is the most progressive ?”’ Mere opinions, prejudices, 
and the like will not serve to answer the question ade- 
quately. The critical thinker will need a mass of scien- 
tific evidence to support the points claimed for each par- 
ty, and partisanship in the popular sense will be of no 
avail. He will analyze, gather data, and evaluate before 
he attempts to generalize. This type of thinking is not 
generally cultivated and the responsibility of the schools 
in this direction cannot be overemphasized if educational 
progress is to be achieved. 
The next type, reflective thinking, may be considered 
as a part of complete critical thinking. There is a point, 
however, in making a distinction between the two. Crit- 
ical thinking which involves keen analysis is essential to 
the scientist. Reflective thinking which involves evalu- 
ation is indispensable to the philosopher. In the case of 
reflective thinking one recalls all the relevant past ex- 
periences, views them in their proper perspective, and 
judicially evaluates them in terms of the question to be 
answered. Conclusions so reached are valuable in propor- 
tion to the analysis of the problem and the power of evalu- 
ation which comes through a certain native ability and  
-P-A-G-E-274
md 
260 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
long experience. We speak of the results of critical and 
judicial thinking as wisdom. 
The seventh type is perhaps the most uncommon of 
them all. That is to say that in actual life the creative 
thought of the individual is least developed. The careful 
observer of things and processes may see an omission of 
an element which if present would be of great importance. 
Or he may see a new combination, or recombination, of 
the factors already existent. For example, someone with 
imagination saw men cutting grass with a scythe. The 
task was an arduous one and time-consuming. He con- 
ceived the notion of a grass-cutting device which would 
conserve man’s energy and utilize other motive power 
just as effectively. In some such rough way was born the 
idea of a mower. All modern devices in the mechanical 
world are the result of creative thinking. Creative genius 
| accounts for what we have in music, in art, in literature, 
| in government, and so on through the categories of man’s 
| activities. But all this has been made possible by the few. 
The many reap the benefits of the results. What can the 
schools do to stimulate creative thinking? In the Lincoln 
School of Teachers College there exists one example. Many 
more can doubtless be located. In this particular school, 
even the primary children sing words of their own com- 
position to melodies of their own creation. They are en- 
couraged to create, and in the upper grades to the creation 
of words and music is added the construction of the mu- 
sical instruments used in the reproduction of their own 
and other music. Thus, in one instance, are the possibili- 
ties of the development of creative thinking being util- 
ized in a practical way. 
The first four forms of thinking are generally prev- 
 
-P-A-G-E-275
See 
PSYCHOLOGY AND TEACHING 261 
alent in greater or less degree. The last three are far 
less prevalent. The first four need direction, the last three 
need stimulation, encouragement, development, and direc- 
tion. Teachers need to observe all these types of thinking 
since thinking determines a considerable proportion of 
human behavior. 
The characteristics of reasoning have already been 
implied in these types of thinking. When one is faced by 
a problem and is called upon to find a solution then the 
stage is set for reasoning. He may fumble about, trying 
this or that method, doing things totally unrelated to 
each other to say nothing of their remote relation to the 
problem at hand. That is not reasoning. The gifted rea- 
soner makes a careful analysis of the total situation, re: 
calls past experiences which seem to bear directly on the 
problem, and selects the means which seem most likely to 
produce desired results. Good habits of thinking mean 
good reasoning ability. To think critically, judicially, and 
creatively calls upon one’s reserve strength, physically as 
well as mentally, and probably explains the statement that 
reflective thinking is the most difficult of human activi- 
ties when carried on actively to a successful completion. 
If so, all the more reason why teachers need to under- 
stand the processes of reasoning in order that habitual in- 
telligent thinking may become an increasingly important 
outcome of classroom activities. 
General Intelligence and Intelligence Testing 
The concept of general intelligence, which is of com- 
paratively recent origin, is so important in its educa- 
tional and social significance that the beginning teacher 
needs to study its problems from the outset of his profes-

sional preparation. Here no treatment is pretended be- 
yond an introduction to the subject. Early psychologists 
were inclined to separate the mind into faculties which 
implied that an individual might possess native ability 
in one direction and not in another as regarded mental 
processes. When scientific experimentation in education 
| had become well established, the results of investigation 
began to point to the conclusion that if a person could 
readily learn to do one thing he could probably easily learn 
to do other things which involve reactions of a similar 
character. That accumulating body of evidence gave rise 
to the hypothesis as a workable theory, and modern educa- 
tion has already been significantly modified in accordance 
therewith. The earlier psychologists failed to differentiate 
clearly between information, memory, and intelligence. 
At the present time a relatively sharp distinction is made, 
and intelligence is not measured by one’s ability to re- 
call past experiences, but by one’s ability to meet new 
situations in which the individual will utilize his past 
experiences in order to make a suitable response. 
Pintner defines intelligence, for the teacher, as the 
“ability to learn.” Gates says that “by intelligence is 
meant a group or composite of native capacities for learn- 
ing along the lines that require mental operations with 
verbal, symbolic, and abstract materials.” + 
The German psychologist, Stern, gave in his definition 
a clear distinction between the old and the new concept of 
general intelligence. “Intelligence is a general capacity 
of an individual consciously to adjust his thinking to new 
requirements.” And again, “General intelligence is the

ability of the organism to adjust itself adequately to new 
situations.” This clearly is a subordination of informa- 
tion and memory to the novel situation. The degree of 
suecess with which adjustments are made is measured by 
one’s degree of intelligence which has been pointed out 
as a native capacity. There is at present a tendency to 
recognize general intelligence as a composite of capacities 
which enables the organism to adjust adequately and 
readjust itself under new conditions. 
There are various assumptions with reference to general 
intelligence which are of educational importance. It is 
assumed that there is a growth of intelligence from birth 
to maturity, from that time on remaining relatively con- 
stant. The rate of growth is most rapid during the first 
five years of life and the rate’ diminishes as maturity is 
approached. What maturity means in this case is still a 
matter of dispute. The theories in use place the date of 
maturity at the age of fourteen to sixteen approximately. 
This does not mean that the individual does not learn 
beyond that age. We all know he does learn. It merely 
means that after that age his capacity for learning does 
not increase. 
It is further assumed that the general intelligence of 
human beings is distributed over a normal curve. That 
is to say that there will be a distribution similar to that 
indicated by the following figure (Fig. 2), when the re- 
sults of intelligence testing are used as measures of the 
general intelligence of a large group (thousands) of indi- 
viduals. 
General intelligence testing developed with the growth 
of the concept of general intelligence. The psychologists 
have endeavored to find information, problems, questions,

puzzles, ete., which would be common to all children and 
which would not have been met by the child under any 
but ordinary home and school conditions. The informa- 
tion involved, then, according to the theory, is that which 
children commonly acquire under ordinary conditions of 
life and the extent of acquisition of such knowledge is a 
part of the test of native capacity for learning. The prob- 
lems and questions are those which children have not pre- 
viously solved or answered and in this way the ability 
to adjust to the new situation is tested. There are lan- 
guage and non-language tests of general intelligence for 
group and for individual testing. The three purposes of 
general intelligence testing for children and in the schools 
are (1) classification, (2) diagnosis, and (3) prognosis.

PSYCHOLOGY AND TEACHING 265 
By the different means of indicating intelligence ratings, 
such as mental age, intelligence quotient, etc., individuals 
may roughly be located in a distribution of their group. 
The curve of distribution may not be as smooth as the one 
in Fig. 2, and the number of groups may vary. Suppose, 
for example, that an entering class in college numbered 
three hundred students. It might be desirable and pos- 
sible to limit the groups each to thirty students. Instead 
of dividing three hundred by ten and taking the individ- 
uals for each group according to alphabetical order, it is 
more desirable to group them according to intellectual 
ability. The intelligence test is a useful device for this 
purpose and makes such a classification possible when 
desired. 
By intelligence tests the difficulties of the individual 
student are sometimes revealed. When careful diagnosis 
is undertaken, the individual intelligence test is more ser- 
viceable than the group test. Many different tests will be 
used. There is a tendency to subdivide intelligence into 
abstract, concrete (motor), and social. Along with this 
tendency are the efforts to determine physiological and 
anatomical age, emotional age, and moral age. Such de 
terminations would greatly facilitate individual diagno- 
sis. The prognostic value of intelligence tests has been 
less well defined than either the classification or diagnos- 
tie values. To determine what the child should do in his 
future activities is very difficult. Tests so far have con- 
tributed in this direction by showing in some cases what 
an individual should not undertake. 
The movement of intelligence testing has gone far be- 
yond the stage of a fad. As methods of testing become 
more and more refined the use of intelligence testing in

schools will become of increasingly greater value. Already 
it has reached a state of importance which is of extreme 
educational significance. 
Individual Differences 
Inheritance and environment are the two causes of 
individual differences.) Through inheritance we possess 
different physical and mental characteristics. We are short 
or tall, slender or stout, blonde or brunette, etc., due to 
ancestral influences sometimes immediate and sometimes 
remote. Sex differences and racial differences also con- 
tribute to the widely varying characteristics of mankind. 
By ancestral influence we are unlike in different degrees 
in mentality. Our capacity to learn, our general intelli- 
gence, seems to be modified by the contents of the germ 
cell. There is little evidence to warrant the conclusion 
that differences in mental characteristics are traceable 
to sex influence and the evidence that racial influence is 
a factor is also seriously questioned. 
Environment as a powerful factor in explaining in- 
dividual differences is not to be overlooked. The effect of 
environment is noticeable in physical and in mental differ- 
ences but on the whole more noticeable in the case of the 
latter. Deafness, blindness, disease, crippling, ete., may 
be entirely due to environmental conditions. The capacity 
to learn is a native endowment but the exercise of this 
capacity depends upon environment—home, community, 
and school conditions. Thus one might find a child of in- 
ferior mental ability, by surrounding facilities, guidance, 
and persistent effort, equalling or excelling a child of su- 
perior mentality whose environment militated against 
the complete development of his intellectual powers.

PSYCHOLOGY AND TEACHING 267 
So we are introduced to a variety of differences de- 
pendent upon a multiplicity of causes—race, maturity, 
sex, home conditions, school facilities, community influ- 
ences, and so on, in their many subdivisions. These fac- 
tors to a greater or less degree affect physical abilities, in- 
tellectual capacities and achievement, emotional develop- 
ment and social adjustment. Each trait of human nature, 
native or acquired, prevails in a wide range of existing 
forms. For many of these traits definite means of meas- 
urement have been devised. These human characteristics 
will enter the realm of the quantitative in proportion to 
the growth of scientific study of psychology. The teacher 
must be constantly watchful to discover the slightest dif- 
ferences which may profoundly affect his methods of pro- 
cedure. To treat all children alike is one of the most crim- 
inal principles of pedagogy ever advocated. 
Summary 
The beginning teacher needs to familiarize himself 
with the field of educational psychology. To fully under- 
stand processes one needs to understand structure. Phys- 
iological psychology is therefore important not only in 
providing a foundation for later study but also for creat- 
ing proper appreciation of the marvelous complexity of 
the human body in its relation to conduct. Teachers need 
also to sense the difference between native traits, inborn 
tendencies, inherited characteristics, instinctive behavior, 
and acquired characteristics or learned behavior. The de- 
gree of possible modifiability of the inherited marks the 
limits of learning. Habit formation in the acquisition of 
skills and knowledge hinges upon this degree of modifia- 
bility.

268 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
The emotionality of the child presents another field for 
careful inquiry. Our emotions may be less analyzable but 
we have them and they should be utilized to the best ad- 
vantage of the individual and of society. Another prob- 
lem of the teacher which rests upon an understanding of 
psychological principles is that of stimulating, develop- 
ing, and directing right thinking habits. Without habit- 
ual intelligent thinking more general than its present field 
of existence, there can be little hope for more rapid so- 
cial progress. This is clearly the major problem of edu- 
cation. It must be remembered that the individual can- 
not learn to think unless he has something to think about 
so the emphasis upon better thinking habits is not in- 
tended to exclude subject matter. Individual differences 
which include general intelligence represent another com- 
prehensive field of psychology. The earnest teacher will 
undertake as early as possible in his professional activi- 
ties to master the content of these various fields of psy- 
chology and any others which in this necessarily brief 
chapter may appear to have been omitted in fact or by 
inference. Psychology is fundamental to good teaching. 
It explains human behavior in terms of teaching prob- 
lems.

  CHAPTER XV 
THE CONCEPTION OF EDUCATION AS A SCIENCE 
General Misunderstanding of ‘‘Scientific Evidence’’ 
It has been claimed that education is a science. Ac- 
cording to such a statement it may be safely assumed that 
at the present time there have been developments in the 
field of education which may with impunity be termed 
scientific. It should not be assumed that all effort in edu- 
cation has been scientific in character nor should all non- 
scientific work be entirely discredited. The question may 
very well be raised as to the distinctions between scientific 
procedure and non-scientific effort. That the differences 
are not commonly understood is easily illustrated. At a 
recent conference at which there were nearly two hundred 
representatives of institutions of higher learning the pre- 
siding officer proposed a question for discussion. The 
question, “What effects are known to result in teaching 
classes of one hundred or more members as contrasted to 
the results in a class of thirty?” provoked a storm of ex- 
temporaneous speeches. To most of the participants in 
the discussion to increase the class membership of thirty 
two-, three-, or fourfold was unthinkable. Many voiced 
their protests and a few related incidents from their expe- 
riences to justify their opposition. When the chairman 
had an opportunity to reply he stated that he had felt, until 
271  
-P-A-G-E-286
en ee ep pe Speen ne tee ea 
272 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
recently, very much as the group seemed to feel but that 
there seemed to be no scientific evidence tc support the 
idea that the class of thirty invariably does better work 
than the class of one hundred. Again there was a spon- 
taneous flow of opinion but this time more forcefully 
stated. The chairman had, in their judgment, overlooked 
their testimonials. Their disappointment almost took the 
form of resentment. To all but one of those who spoke this 
experience meeting was the presentation of evidence. One 
speaker, the single exception, referred to a scientific study 
made by Dr. F. W. Breed of University of Chicago on the 
size of classes in the elementary school. The opinions of 
serious men and women are valuable but cannot be substi- 
tuted for conclusions based upon scientific methods of 
procedure. One’s beliefs, judgments, pronouncements are 
valid in the proportion to which they are formulated upon 
sufficient data, properly classified, carefully verified, and 
intelligently interpreted. 
What Scientific Method Comprises 
The Character Education Institution, Chevy Chase, 
Washington, D. C., has issued a statement of what con- 
stitutes the scientific method.1_ Contrast the points enu- 
merated and briefly elaborated under the description of the 
method to the usual procedure in opinion forming: 
The scientific method necessitates intensive, systematic and 
persistent brain activity under control against misunderstand- 
ings, superficiality and bias, and in complete loyalty to reality 
and the truth. 
None but those having aptitude, instruction and training can 
be successful in the use of the scientific method of thinking.

Description or THE MetHop 
(1) Garner pata on the problem or within a selected field 
according to some adequate plan by means of numerous and 
accurate observations made with the human senses, assisted 
and corrected by instruments of precision. The observations 
are usually with a well-defined purpose but sometimes for in- 
formation according to opportunity. Observations must be 
recorded in definite terms and measurements and in specific 
statements. Many observers may collaborate in gathering data. 
(2) Cuassiry pata on the basis of similarities, variations, 
activities, processes, causes, results. Distinguish between es- 
sential and superficial characters. 
(3) GENERALIZE to get principles and theories into tentative 
form. Use constructive imagination, discernment, known prin- 
ciples, to formulate reasonable generalizations that solve the 
problem or explain the known facts in the selected field. Many 
researches accept a mass of classified data and verified gen- 
eralizations and then proceed to solve some problem by formu- 
jating hypotheses thereon and verifying these, without includ- 
ing general gathering of data and classification work. 
(4) Veriry generalizations by controlled experiments, by 
tested predictions of results, by repetition of experiments and 
the gathering of additional data. Appraise data by coefficients 
of variations and of correlations, and by probable error. De- 
termine sources of error*in method and apparatus, and evaluate 
by auxiliary investigations. State all assumptions and include 
them in the conclusions. 
(5) Report the. research in full and subject results to criti- 
cism and verification by others competent to collaborate. 
(6) Announce the results of the research to the general 
public for practical use. 
Characteristics of a Scientist 
As a part of the same report twelve characteristics of 
the scientists are listed : 
(1) Sincere and open-minded; not diverted by personal 
interests. 
(2) Alert and alive to truth, vital; not complacent. 
(8) Poised; not excitable, hysterical or melancholy.  
-P-A-G-E-288
ee ee ee ee ee ee eM cc Ee OME ee ee he ge fie yl neo e 
274 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
(4) Discerning; not superficial. 
(5) Accurate; not indefinite. 
(6) Inventive and constructive; not lacking initiative. 
(7) Independent; not suggestible. 
(8) Thoughtful; not merely impulsive. 
(9) Industrious and energetic; not lazy and dilatory. 
(10) Executive; not haphazard. 
(11) Purposeful; not led merely by likes and dislikes. 
(12) Self-confident; not timid. 
Self-rating on the basis of these twelve characteristics 
may not be encouraging, but if properly utilized such an 
analysis should not be discouraging. It is not a tenable 
theory that the teacher must be a scientist. The best teach- 
er is an artist. Art and science perform separate func- 
tions, but both are extremely essential to educational prog- 
ress. The scientist as already indicated is the producer of 
facts and not their interpreter nor their evaluator. He 
may take known facts and by process of isolation or com- 
bination experimentally ascertain other facts. Having 
done that he presents his findings to the philosopher who 
evaluates them. These facts are then interpreted by the 
artist. The artist needs to be clearly conscious of the ex- 
istence of the facts and cognizant of their relative values. 
The pianist may be utterly ignorant of the amount and 
kind of scientific thought and energy which has made the 
piano possible. He does know how it operates, is skillful 
in the techniques of piano playing, and fully appreciates 
the place of piano playing in the social order. 
So it is with the teacher who is an artist. The teacher 
may not be trained in scientific procedure of determining 
facts in education, but he appreciates the results of scien- 
tific effort. Like the musician he must be able to recog- 
nize the best quality among the multifarious offerings in   
 
-P-A-G-E-289
ee TEES RO Re RE ee ee 
EDUCATION AS A SCIENCE 275 
his field. He must know how to use the scientific mate- 
rial which may again be primarily the results of scien- 
tific experimentation. To the extent that the teacher is 
able to determine the best materials and way of handling 
them he will be valuable to the school system. 
“Intellectual Immoralities’’ 
It seems quite likely that the teacher needs to be more 
a philosopher than a scientist. Indeed, interpretation can- 
not take place without evaluation. But fortunate is that 
teacher who in addition to his power of interpretation 
has the scientific attitude. To be truly great as a teacher 
one must avoid the “Intellectual Immoralities” proposed 
by the Character Education Institute. The following list 
is included in the report from which quotations have al- 
ready been made in this chapter: 
(1) Carelessness in observations, “sloppy work.” 
(2) Inaccuracy in determining units to be counted in 
statistical research. 
(8) Slovenliness in logic, fantastic explanations. 
(4) Generalizing beyond one’s data. 
(5) Confusing opinions with knowledge. 
(6) Confidence in the results of research in disregard of 
weakness in proof and verification. 
(7) Contentment with “discussion.” 
(8) Poor judgment in research plan and procedure. 
(9) Wavering interest, flitting attention, attracted by pecu- 
liar superficialities. 
(10) Egoism allowed to crowd one to the invention of “new” 
theories for personal distinction. 
(11) Inventing interesting theories for the sake of selling 
them in books, articles, lectures and conversation. 
(12) Pride allowed to result in persistent belief in a theory 
for which one has been given credit. 
(18) Formulating an hypothesis on weak bases of facts, and 
then becoming blind to facts in opposition.
-P-A-G-E-290
    276 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
(14) Emotionalism during research, “I believe” instead of “I 
have proved.” | 
(15) Adjusting theories to popular likes and dislikes. 
(16) Opposition to proof of another’s theories because of 
jealousy. 
(17) Opposition to a theory merely because of ignorance and 
stupidity, “I can not see how.” 
(18) Rushing into print with a report of research work that 
justified no conclusions. 
(19) Degenerating into a propagandist of an unproved hy- 
pothesis, instead of being true to the research purpose of dis- 
covering the truth. 
(20) Cowardice in supporting a verified generalization be- 
cause it is unpopular and conflicts with selfish interests. 
(21) Impatience, unwillingness to proceed step by step 
through a research. 
(22) Indulgence in dense verbiage for the sake of appearing 
superlearned. 
(23) Ignorance of the mechanism of instruments of pre- 
cision, which results in their use when out of order. 
Science in Education 
To summarize our thought about the place of science 
in education as it concerns the teacher: 
Opinions, beliefs, judgments are important in so far as 
they are founded upon scientifically determined facts. It 
is by no means necessary that the one holding opinions 
should himself have determined the facts warranting the 
conclusions advocated, but it is necessary that the exponent 
of opinion be certain that his conclusions are well rooted 
in facts clearly established as such. Imagination, specu- 
lation, prevision, day-dreaming, all have their value but 
can in no sense be substituted for scientifically ascertained 
facts. They may precede scientific investigation but each 
must cling to its own domain. The two types of activity 
cannot exist in the same place at the same time. Doubt- 
 
-P-A-G-E-291
ee ee 
EDUCATION AS A SCIENCE 277 
less many social, political, religious, economic, and edu- 
cational maladies are due to the substitution of opinion 
based upon mere supposition for convictions growing out 
of established truths. It is the teacher’s obligation to avoid 
such pitfalls and to teach the difference between truth and 
near-truth in its widely varying degrees. 
If the aspects of scientific inquiry are understood we 
are now in a position to consider the claims of education 
asa science. It has been contended by the “pure science” 
workers that education has no valid claim to such a classi- 
fication. In fact, it is claimed that the scientific work in 
education has been of such relatively recent origin and 
hence so little developed that its classification as an ap- 
plied science is open to serious questioning. 
Those who urge that education is a science point with 
pride to the work of many eminent men in the field of 
education. Unquestionably the best work being done in 
the field of psychology, in school administration, and in 
curriculum making are typical of scientific procedure in 
education. 
In psychology the development of mental testing, the 
investigations on transfer of learning, the study of ana- 
tomical and physiological growth in their relation to men- 
tal development, the work in reading, handwriting, spell- 
ing, arithmetic, algebra, etc., are illustrative of real sci- 
entific procedure. 
In school administration the standardization of school 
buildings and building equipment, the classification and 
promotion of pupils, problems of educational finance, and 
the like point to a real science of school administration. 
In curriculum making the experimental schools attack 
the questions of methods, materials, and measurements
-P-A-G-E-292

278 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
scientifically. Statistical procedure is vigorously applied 
to the problems of educational measurements. Facts sci- 
entifically determined in the field of psychology are made 
operative in the use of materials and in the utilization of 
materials. A few concrete illustrations of scientific effort 
in education will serve to establish the position that there 
is a science of education. 
The Construction of a Standardized Achievement Test. 
—Contrast the formation of a standardized achievement 
test with the creation of the usual list of examination 
questions. In preparing a reading test, for example, the 
one developing the test along scientific lines would first 
of all bear in mind the anticipated outcomes of reading. 
To make the illustration more simple, let us consider two 
problems of reading: the first, increase in comprehension. 
and second, increase in rate of reading. The tester will 
then limit his efforts to a restricted area so that the range 
of scores in comprehension and the range of scores in 
speed may not be too great. That is, he will prepare a 
test which is too difficult to enable an eighth grade pupil, 
for example, to obtain a perfect score and not so difficult 
that a third-grade pupil would be unable to make any 
score. This could be accomplished by testing experiment- 
ally the various forms of the test. The tests could be given 
to thousands of pupils ranging in grades from the third 
to the eighth. If the tester were trying to provide ques- 
tions of equal difficulty, he would finally select those which 
had been answered by approximately the same number 
of children of nearly the same ability. If he wished to 
arrange the questions in order of difficulty from the least 
difficult to the most difficult, he would again use the method 
of wide application and place at the beginning of the list   
   
-P-A-G-E-293
eee ER Te 
EDUCATION AS A SCIENCE 279 
that question which had been correctly answered by the 
highest percentage of pupils tested. And so on until he 
located the most difficult question he wished to use, locat- 
ing it by the lowest percentage of pupils correctly answer- 
ing it. By statistical procedure each question could then 
be given a definite value. For example, the pupil who 
answers correctly the easiest questions in a graded list 
obviously deserves less credit than the one able to answer 
correctly the most difficult ones. Hence each question is 
assigned a value ranging from a small amount to a rela- 
tively large amount, proceeding from the least difficult 
to the most difficult. The total of the values credited to an 
individual pupil would constitute his score in that test. 
After deciding upon the questions to be used whether a 
list of equal difficulty or a list of graded difficulty, the 
test scores for several hundred pupils in each grade would 
furnish the means for determining what each grade norm 
or general average is in that particular test. The norm 
is the central measure of that group of pupils. Roughly 
it will indicate that about fifty per cent of the group had 
scores below that score and that about fifty per cent had 
scores above that point. The measure of the norm cor- 
responds to what is generally thought of as the general 
average. The median is the measure most often used in 
statistics because it is more easily obtained and less affected. 
by unusual variations in the range of scores. The me 
dian is that point in a distribution of grades of any given 
test upon either side of which there is exactly fifty per 
cent of the cases. 
With a normal score in a test for the different grades 
for which the test is devised the teacher, if his purposes 
in teaching the subject are the same as those which the
-P-A-G-E-294
  280 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
tests are designed to measure, 7 be able to determine 
the actual status of his class and of the individual pupils 
of the class. In addition he will have an instrument of 
measurement if the test has different reliable forms by 
which he and his pupils can individually or as a group 
measure the rate or amount of improvement or both. This, 
in the case of reading, could be applied either to compre- 
hension or speed, norms having been established in the 
different grades for each. 
The scientific tester will keep in mind two points not 
heretofore explained. Obviously he cannot use the same 
set of questions or problems repeatedly in the same class, 
nor is it wise to do so in classes whose members inter- 
mingle. So he prepares other forms, but all forms, while 
containing different questions or problems, must measure 
the same thing and must closely agree in results. That 
is, if a second form be applied to the same large group of 
children in the same grade, the range of scores and the 
norm should closely correspond. The technical term of 
such a result is reliability. The other point which in 
logical presentation precedes reliability is that which is 
technically known as validity. That means that the re- 
sults of the test must substantially agree with other ways 
of measuring the same product. Teachers’ judgments, 
other tests devised to measure the same thing, etc., should 
be used in determining the validity of the new test. Need- 
less to say in addition that the new test must test the prod- 
uct it pretends to measure. 
The Use of Standardized Achievement Tests—A real 
danger exists for the novitiate in the use of standardized 
educational tests. Not many things can be measured in 
a single test and the teacher needs to be cautious in his 
   
-P-A-G-E-295
IE EEE EEE 
EDUCATION AS A SCIENCE 281 
work to insure the inclusion of a thoroughly comprehen- 
sive list of objectives to be reached. Standardized tests 
should not determine what should be taught. What should 
be taught is for the scientific curriculum maker and the 
teachers to decide. The field of educational measurements 
has not reached such a high stage of development, and 
never should, when it can dictate the content of courses. 
That standardized tests are helpful seems relatively 
clear. Standardized tests make the teacher’s grades more 
valuable in that they become more definite, more precise, 
and, hence, more comparable. 
The custom which has prevailed among teachers in pre- 
paring examinations has been quite different from the 
procedure used in the preparation of standardized tests. 
The description just given is general and inadequate for 
a thorough study of the process but serves as an introduc- 
tion and can be used to point out more vividly the defects 
in usual examination procedure. The teacher ordinarily 
governs the number of questions by the anticipated amount 
of time and effort needed in reading the examination pa- 
pers. The value of the questions depends entirely upon 
the single judgment of the teacher. There is little likeli- 
hood that the set of questions or problems will be sub- 
jected to the critical scrutiny of experts. Hence a ten- 
dency to be less self-exacting becomes a real danger from 
the point of view of excellence in testing. The papers con- 
sequently almost never represent a true measure of the 
pupils’ abilities. In fact, the grading process itself is sub- 
ject to the influences of indigestion, sleeplessness, pseudo- 
altruism, and many other conditions both mental and 
physical to which the teacher, being human, is liable. It 
therefore makes teachers’ grades less definite, less pre-
-P-A-G-E-296
ee eae 3 
282 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
cise, and, so, less comparable. In truth the grades of the 
same teacher are not comparable to say nothing of com- 
parisons with other teachers’ work with pupils of the same 
ability in the same general subject. 
Classification and Promotion.—In the matter of class- 
ification and promotion we have made notably progressive 
strides due to scientific accomplishments. One factor used 
in classification and promotion are the results of mental 
testing. Psychological investigation has produced general 
intelligence tests which are fairly dependable for classifi- 
cation purposes. Physiological and anatomical measure- 
ments have been scientifically devised, which may be used 
as another factor. Scientific workers are endeavoring to 
measure social development and emotional qualities. 
When that has been done two more elements will have been 
identified and definitely indicated. Then the standard 
educational tests may be used and as another factor the 
teacher’s judgment. By statistical procedure these factors 
may be weighted and combined. The result will be a more 
accurate means of classification and promotion than is 
ordinarily employed. Heretofore we have relied upon 
judgment alone.

  CHAPTER XVI 
METHOD 
It will be seen from the outset of any discussion about 
method that it is impossible to think about it without 
considering the subject matter involved. What we do 
and how we do it are correlative. What we do in the 
light of our purposes may, however, be a strong deter- 
minant in how we act in a given situation. Method then 
may be distinguished from subject matter for the purposes 
of thinking by considering it as a way of doing something, 
a manner of behaving. It is a means to an end, and in 
the proportion that the end in view is a definitely accept- 
able one to the individual concerned in the performance 
of the activity the effort to discover the best way will be 
stressed. That raises the next question which for the 
beginning teacher is an intensely practical one. What are 
the factors whicl make an end desired? What are the 
elements which constitute a purpose ? 
Motivation 
This is a term which has been misunderstood by teachers 
to the extent that many educational sins have been com- 
mitted in its name. It has been interpreted into a wide 
variety of meanings. There is that kind of motivation 
which is exemplified by the donkey and the carrot; there 
is that which is illustrated by the action of the slave driver 
and his lash; and there is that which is typified by the 
284

METHOD 285 
true missionary spirit—the recognition of a need, the 
earnest desire to contribute toward the removal of the 
cause and to help reorganize the situation to the advantage 
of all concerned. In the first place what to do must be 
met by how to do it. To prevail upon the donkey to move 
the load forward is the question. The donkey, the cart, 
the load, the distance to be covered, the time remaining in 
which the problem must be solved, and so on are the factors 
which make up what is thought of as subject matter. How 
the purpose shall be accomplished involves method. So 
the driver searches in his past experiences which resemble 
closely the one with which he is now confronted and re- 
members that the carrot when properly used is a great 
inducement to the donkey to move. And so the donkey 
is tempted by the carrot but because he isn’t quite able to 
reach it he moves forward a few steps. But the carrot is 
still out of reach and the donkey takes a few more steps. 
After this process has continued over a sufficiently long 
period of time the donkey has temporarily recovered from 
his balkiness and is willing to proceed, especially if he is 
amply rewarded by the acquisition of the carrot. The 
process has been slow. The donkey is about the same 
donkey as he was before and he is quite likely in the future 
to decline to participate in the driver’s plans in an efficient 
manner unless volacated in like manner. In fact he will 
be no different the rest of his days and he never will be 
considered by his owner as a very useful animal. Nor will 
he at the end of his life be able to boast of any achieve- 
ments of consequence. 
There are those teachers who have interpreted motiva- 
tion in the same light. Their method of getting results 
has been of this very nature. The child, if he gets his

lessons well, may go home early or is given a coveted prize, 
or is extended certain special privileges. He is coaxed 
into everything orthodox he does in the classroom and soon 
forms the attitude of expecting an external reward for all 
effort. What he learns in the processes involved in finish- 
ing the task assigned is of doubtful amount or nature. 
At any rate it is incidental. Herein lies a grave danger 
for the enthusiastic young teacher who has been fascinated 
by the term motivation and has failed to appreciate its 
best meaning. 
Many laymen and indeed many school people are so 
disturbed by the process of securing pupil effort just dis- 
cussed that they plead for anything to protect the children 
from the evil effects of “sugar-coating” classroom activi- 
ties. Often the argument is advanced that everything is 
made too easy for the pupil. As they rationalize about 
their own learning they point with pride to the conditions 
which forced them to learn to read, write, and compute 
arithmetic. Discipline was good for them, they reason, 
and so it must be good for all. To be sure the argument 
is incomplete and worse than that it is beside the point. 
The effect is none the less noticeable. Another extreme 
position is taken, and the “lash” method is employed. And 
with what effect? The master and slave picture is fairly 
representative. The slave driven by the sting of the cruel 
lash does his master’s bidding, and probably definite results 
are accomplished. But as soon as the pressure of the 
situation is removed the activity proceeds only under fear 
of future consequences. It is safe to assume that the work 
will be poorly done or at best done only in a barely accept- 
able manner and the social maladjustment will be increased 
rather than diminished. Hate, fear, and malice will be
-P-A-G-E-301
cn 
METHOD 287 
engendered, and what is equally deplorable if not worse is 
the stultifying effect upon the one driven. Initiative is 
destroyed and the development of the personality of the 
subject is made an impossibility. And so the conceivable 
benefits of wholesome codperation on the part of all mem- 
bers of society to the extent of their capabilities is lost. 
The slave remains a slave. Such conditions in effect are 
not unknown in the field of school learning. The child 
acts through fear, he dislikes his teachers, the school, and 
is in danger of detesting all that he has heard that the 
school stands for. He becomes a potential outlaw because 
his attitude has been warped, not by what he has had to 
learn so much as by the methods used by the teacher in 
attempting to force him to learn. 
It may seem absurd to emphasize extreme cases and yet 
it remains a fact that some modification of one or the other 
or both of these methods takes a prominent place in 
the teaching process. What then can be done about the 
matter? Certainly we can disabuse ourselves of certain 
fallacies which too often dominate the class procedure. 
In the first place we can studiously avoid either of the 
extremes cited. We must carefully consider the nature of 
theindividual child. Many times have we heard that the 
teacher must be impartial. To most people that has meant 
that each child should be treated in exactly the same 
way. The facts now known about human nature preclude 
the acceptance of any such meaning of impartiality. Be 
tween the carrot and the lash are many variations. It is 
conceivable that at some time in the child’s development 
he may be located on the line somewhere between those 
differences. If so and no other means scem effective, let 
the needed remedy be applied with wisdom. But there is —a
-P-A-G-E-302
  288 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
another alternative, another line of procedure which is 
more fundamental to the learning process. What has been 
said thus far with reference to method has referred to 
the usual conception of method. That is to say, method 
has been commonly considered as a means of obtaining 
results viewed principally from the standpoint of the 
teacher in his relationship to the child. The viewpoint of 
the child with reference to his attitude toward his school 
work, when considered at all, has been of secondary impor- 
tance. In other words, we have stressed methods of teach- 
ing to the exclusion of methods of study. If we can 
discover the best methods of study and permit our methods 
of teaching to be controlled by those factors we shall have 
approached the heart of the problem. To do that effec- 
tively we must consider the teacher in a different light 
from that in which too often he is placed. 
In this new conception the child takes the center of 
the stage. What can we learn about him? What is his 
family history? Have his environmental influences been 
favorable or unfavorable from the viewpoint of the re- 
quirements of society? What are his interests? Are they 
laudable or not? What are his abilities? His future 
needs? Doubtless he should have guidance, but how 
much? These and many others are questions with which 
the teacher is continually confronted and the degree to 
which they are answered with wisdom will mark the degree 
of his success. We have already thought of the child 
as a growing entity. To be sure, we must not trust to 
his interests alone as they must of necessity be limited 
and they may be perverted. The teacher’s function then 
becomes directive and not controlling. Where the child’s 
interest is commendable the teacher will develop that in-
-P-A-G-E-303
SE oC ner ear reece re ty Seer eae On Snr Nel a eee ee 
METHOD 289 
terest and direct it into higher and better channels of 
activity. Where the child’s interest is faulty the teacher 
will guide the child into other directions compatible with 
future needs. 
Motivation in the light of this theory is something far 
more fundamental than the application of devices by the 
teacher to bring about temporary results. It is the direc- 
tion and development and sometimes creation of the child’s. 
interests to realize through honest effort the desirable and 
lasting results sought. Devices may continue to be used 
to a good advantage, but their true significance must be 
comprehended by the teacher in their relation to the main 
purposes of education. This conception of the teacher’s 
relationship with the child will constitute the foundation 
upon which the third interpretation of motivation, re- 
ferred to earlier in the chapter, may be expected to take 
form. 
General Method. 
It is maintained that all learning is analytic and selec- 
tive! It must also be conceded that there are general _ 
principles underlying all conduct. If these principles 
function adequately they must give direction to method, « 
and in so far as they fall short of specific application 
they may be considered as furnishing the basis of what 
is known as general method. While it is unsafe to 
rely solely upon generalities it must not be overlooked 
that they materially aid thinking. General principles 
give us the first rough classification from which the refin- 
ing influence of special application must emanate—first 
the foundation, then the framework. General method 
+See Arthur I. Gates, Psychology for Students of Education (Mac- 
millan Co.).    
-P-A-G-E-304
  290 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
should furnish the foundation upon which the framework 
of special methods is to rest and the effectiveness of the 
special methods so constructed will depend to a great 
extent upon the validity of the general methods from which 
the beginnings were made. 
The Laws of Learning 
The best formulation of a basis upon which to build 
methods is found in the laws of learning as stated by 
Thorndike and used so generally by others in the field of 
education. It should be remembered that the underlying 
psychology of Thorndike is the situation-response theory. 
That is to say that all conduct depends upon specific reac- 
tions to specific elements in a situation. It assumes, too, 
that there are native responses and acquired responses. 
For example a child cries or it appears to adults that the 
child is crying when it may be but a manifestation of 
physical growth or development. The crying is a native 
response to a situation which is also a natural situation, 
namely that of expression of some variety. But the child 
in crying attracts the attention of his mother and is per- 
haps made more comfortable. He soon learns that by 
crying he can get this satisfying attention and so acquires 
a response to a given situation which in turn creates a 
response which brings satisfaction. 
These laws are stated as the laws of readiness, exercise, 
and effect. The first has reference to the state of readiness 
or unreadiness of different conduction units to act. The 
second is concerned with the amounts and time variables 
of practice and the third is related to the fundamental 
theory of satisfiers and annoyers. The three laws are 
stated by Thorndike as follows:
-P-A-G-E-305
SE Ss eee Se eR 
METHOD 291 
The Law of Readiness is: When any conduction unit is in 
readiness to conduct, for it to do so is satisfying. When any 
conduction unit is not in readiness to conduct, for it to conduct 
is annoying. When any conduction unit is in readiness to 
conduct, for it not to do so is annoying, 
The Law of Exercise comprises the Laws of Use and Disuse. 
The Law of Use is: When a modifiable connection is made 
between a situation and a response, that connection’s strength 
is, other things being equal, increased. The Law of Disuse is: 
When a modifiable connection is not made between a situation 
and a response during a length of time, that connection’s 
strength is decreased. 
The Law of Effect is: When a modifiable connection between 
a situation and a response is made and is accompanied or 
followed by a satisfying state of affairs, that connection’s 
strength is increased; when made and accompanied or followed 
by an annoying state of affairs, its strength is decreased,” 
It is quite obvious in spite of the technical terminology 
used in stating these laws that they are fundamental to 
habit formation and therefore fundamental to the question 
of method. 
Thorndike lists five subsidiary principles of learning 
characteristic of animal learning. The first states the fact 
of “multiple response to the same external situation.” 
We tend to react in different ways to the same stimulus. 
By the process of education we have learned which way is 
most successful and have thereby eliminated from actual 
practice those means which are less productive of desirable 
results. 
The second principle is that of one’s mental set or 
attitude. It is said that we see what we are looking for 
to the exclusion of practically all else. Quite likely the 
set is determined by uncontrolled conditions such as illness, 
?E. L. Thorndike, Hducational Psychology, Vol. Il, Ch. i. (Bu- 
reau of Publications, Teachers College, Columbia University).

mets a a a I a ad i ia i MS 
292 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
sleepiness, hunger, fear, and so on, or it may be the result 
of conscious effort. The learning process is conditioned by 
the determination of the learner regardless of the cause of 
his particular attitude. The teacher must consider all this 
as well as to attempt to discover and remove the cause if 
the attitude is unfavorable to successful learning. The 
creation of a desirable attitude, when necessary, is equally 
the teacher’s responsibility. 
The third of these principles is called by Thorndike 
the “Law of Partial Activity.” According to this law 
the learner is affected by some prepotent element in the 
situation and because of this dominance may disregard the 
other factors present. Such a selection of dominant parts 
may be explained in terms of past experience. If the 
teacher finds the pupil responding to the wrong elements 
it, of course, becomes his responsibility to direct the 
learner to more adequate factors if they exist or to supply 
them in case they do not exist. 
The fourth principle is known as the “Law, of Assimila- 
tion or Analogy.” That is, the learner tends to act in the 
same fashion in which he had acted either actually or 
vicariously, in a similar situation, If this resembling 
performance has been effective and economical then the 
teacher may encourage the method of analogy. If the 
opposite is true, the teacher is obligated to suppress the 
wrong analogy and to substitute for it a more effective 
parallel or divert the method into an entirely different 
channel. 
The fifth statement of a subsidiary principle of learning 
is called “Associative Shifting.” In a situation presenting 
many elements, the process of shifting emphasis from one 
stimulus to another may in time evoke the same desired  
-P-A-G-E-307
ST ae ee 
METHOD 293 
response. It may be that at the beginning of such learn- 
ing, the most desirable element in the situation is ineffec- 
tive. Through wise guidance by the process of association 
the change can be made from the first potent element to 
that which is most desirable. The problem essentially is 
to secure the correct response by optimum means or 
methods. 
The Socialized Recitation 
Teaching methods are useful as means but rarely as 
ends, as was indicated earlier in the chapter. Learning 
methods may be ends in themselves but ultimately they 
reach out to other objectives. There have been many 
so-called types of recitations. It is safe to say that only 
occasionally does one type prevail throughout a period. 
That statement perhaps-should be qualified to apply to 
skillful teaching. The professional ignoramus may use 
the “criminal prosecution” method and consume hour 
after hour in cross questioning the defendant. Under 
such circumstances we find the direct antithesis of the 
socialized recitation. The responses are largely evoked 
by the teacher’s questions, and only indirectly are the other 
members of the class considered by the pupil and then 
only to wonder if they may be secretly applauding, pitying, 
scorning, or ridiculing him who is “reciting.” Such a 
process is largely individualistic rather than social in 
character. The socialized recitation may take many varia- 
tions of form. (The main purposes of the method is to 
increase the group solidarity in the pursuit of the question 
or problem at hand. It. is a codperative enterprise in 
which teacher and pupils share in the responsibility. Not 
only does it mean “team-work,” but it means the develop-
-P-A-G-E-308
ee ee 
294 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
ment of individual expression. The underlying assump- 
tion is that there is a bond of common interest to insure 
active participation by all members of the group. This 
commonality of purpose may have been developed through 
the assignment or it may have arisen spontaneously in con- 
nection with some phase of the work of the recitation 
period. It means interchange of ideas, codperation in the 
search for evidence as well as in the promotion of dis- 
cussion. The interest comes as an outgrowth of the 
experiences of the group. 
The Problem Method 
There are two ways of considering the meaning of a 
problem. One is that anything which calls for decision or 
action is a problem. The other definition, which is the 
one under consideration in this topic, is that of the situa- 
tion which provokes doubt. It raises questions of what is 
best to do and how it shall best be accomplished. To 
answer such questions elements of critical, judicial, or 
creative thinking may be called into play or elements of 
any two or of all three. This means the assembling of 
data, the sifting of evidence, and the application of con- 
clusions. In addition, frequently imagination or creative 
genius is necessary for the successful solution of the prob- 
lem. This so-called problem method is very effective in 
developing the kinds of thought habits which we have 
hitherto pointed out as most desirable. There are prob- 
lems and problems. The use of this particular device is 
not to supply solutions for the multitude of problems 
which fall to man’s lot but rather to provide him with 
the proper thought habits so that with his accumulated 
information he may more readily meet the novel experi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-309
a aa 
METHOD 295 
ences of life in which problem solving is involved. There 
is doubtless a place where the work of the school becomes 
a matter of chief interest to teacher and pupil alone but 
in the main the socializing process at work in the class- 
room in some form of group participation is more desirable 
than the process of individualization. Not all of life is 
problem solving in which serious doubt is expressed, but 
there are enough doubtful situations constantly arising to 
justify careful consideration of this method of instruction 
by all teachers. 
The Topical Method 
Out of the past have grown important issues. As a 
part of the past certain events, persons, concepts, etc., 
stand out with remarkable clarity for their importance. 
The arrangement of materials in treating these experi- 
ences of the past and the issues of the present has been in 
the main topical. In history, for example, we have a 
chronological treatment of subject matter by topics. Only 
recently has there been a radical departure from the topi- 
cal method of study toward the method of problem solving 
in the study of history and geography. The tendency at 
the present time is to break away from the chronological 
treatment of subject matter in case of unrelated parts and 
to move in the direction of topical treatment and problem 
solving in a complete unitary way. That is, the chronology 
need not be broken, but in the study of a topic no irrelevant 
materials will be used. To find a thread of history and 
go back to its beginning and to trace it to the present 
situation is the essence of the topical method. It pre- 
serves all the advantages of the former presentation of 
subject matter and avoids the dangers of confusion result-
-P-A-G-E-310
a 
296 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
ing from the presentation of too many topics or problems 
at the same time. 
The Project Method 
The key to the definition of a project is the dominating 
purpose underlying any experience. So a project is “any 
unit of purposeful activity where the dominating purpose, 
as an inner urge, (1) fixes the aim of the action, (2) 
guides its process, and (3) furnishes its drive, its inner 
motivation.” * 
Dr. Kilpatrick, who is the best known and most vigorous 
proponent of the project as a useful means of facilitating 
the processes of learning, makes a fourfold classification 
of the types of projects. First, there is the type of project 
in which the actuating purpose leads one to do something 
or to make something, The child has an idea which he 
wishes to express in material form. The kinds of materials 
used are of no significance; the outcome whether it be 
large or small, temporary or enduring is a matter of 
secondary importance. What really counts is the embodi- 
ment of an idea in a purpose leading to positive action in 
doing or making. 
The next type he describes as that which involves en- 
joyment as an outcome of purposeful activity. A baseball 
enthusiast watching a game between two well-matched 
teams, an individual engrossed in the intriguing plot of 
the latest “best-seller,” the student of dramatic art at the 
theater, these and the like represent the second type of 
project. Notice that there accompanies this process the

cation. Reprinted by permission of the Macmillan Co., publishers.
-P-A-G-E-311
(SI ta 
METHOD 297 
will to enjoy which insures activity and precludes passive 
enjoyment. 
The third type is the problem-solving kind. There is a 
dominating inner urge to master some intellectual diffi- 
culty. To an individual so minded there is an interest 
inherent in problem solving. At this point Dr. Kilpatrick 
makes the distinction between problem and project by the 
existence of the dominating purpose in the project. One 
may be faced with a problem, but unless there is no special 
interest, no natural motivating force the problem remains 
only a problem and assumes none of the aspects of a project 
so far as its chief criterion is concerned, namely, pur- 
poseful activity. 
The fourth kind of project is that which involves pur- 
poseful drive toward the acquisition of some specific 
knowledge or skill or some group of knowledges or skills. 
This, one may say, is nothing but drill to effect the desired 
accomplishment. There is an important distinction under 
the drive of purposeful activity and that is attitude. 
There is a vast difference between purpose founded upon 
a desire to please the teacher or desire to get the thing 
finished and out of the way, and the inner interest which 
crystallizes into a definite purpose. The latter is, of 
_ course, by far the more important. 
LProjects may be undertaken and carried to a successful 
completion singly or in groups. It appears that the 
educational problem of the teacher is so to control and 
manipulate the environment in taking all factors into con- 
sideration that the motivation which is expressed in the 
form of a driving purpose may develop naturally and lead 
into “whole-hearted purposeful activity.”

298 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
The Case Method 
This method is a device whereby the inductive process 
of learning is exemplified. Specific instances are used to 
develop a new concept. It is literally proceeding from 
the concrete to the abstract. From concrete cases evidence 
appears which justifies a generalization. Upon further 
verification by the use of further specific instances one 
may be permitted to state his generalization in the form 
of an hypothesis, and later, perhaps, upon further evidence 
it may emerge as a principle or law. In Chapter X the 
| attempt was made to reach the conclusion, through specific 
case illustrations, that educational attainment is a variable 
product and that it rests upon the development of specifies 
in school or out of school. Any illustration which clearly 
pictures a case in point is an effective teaching method 
and should be utilized whenever effectively possible. 
Other ‘‘Methods’’ 
Once before reference was made to the different ways 
of conducting a recitation period and it was pointed out 
that the skillful teacher rarely used one method exclu- 
sively. The different kinds of lessons sometimes listed 
indicate by their names the desired outcome of the methods 
to be employed. We have the development lesson, the 
lesson in appreciation, the drill lesson, the inductive lesson, 
the deductive lesson, the study lesson, the review lesson, 
the recitation lesson and probably many others. There 
are the fields of methods in the assignment of lessons, of 
methods of questioning, of methods of supervised study, 
of methods of administration such as the Dalton Plan, 
but the whole question of methods from the standpoint of 
teaching reverts to the theory that methods are means not

Pe? ty: a aT Ee 
METHOD 299 
ends except from the learner’s point of view. In the latter 
case, methods as ends are coexistent with materials and 
the two are ultimately shaping for the learner ulterior 
objectives of a very definite kind. Method, let us repeat, 
is a way of behaving; we may need to acquire more effec- 
tive modes of conduct in which case the methods learned 
will serve as temporary ends, but always we are forced 
back to the question of what our way of behaving means 
in terms of the larger objectives in life. Method is deep- 
rooted in psychology and philosophy and involves not only 
the what and the how, but also the why. This makes 
method a study of the first magnitude in importance.

CHAPTER XVII 
SUBJECT MATTER 
The usual concept of subject matter is very misleading. 
It is commonly thought of as something which exists in 
material form in textbooks, reference books, magazines, 
newspapers, etc. Such a conception needs to be broken 
down at the outset of one’s professional work in teaching. 
What has been referred to as subject matter is only an 
expression in symbolic form of subject matter in its true 
status. Subject matter exists within the mentality of the 
individual and serves as a guide for his behavior. It is 
veritably a way of acting, as Charters defines it. We tend 
to act according to our experiences as shaped by heredity 
and environment. Those experiences crystallized into 
dynamic form which impel us to this or that activity con- 
stitute subject matter. It is composed of meanings derived 
from experience actual or vicarious. Experience, con- 
sidered as actual, is the result of personal physical par- 
ticipation. Vicarious experience is that in which we 
participate only intellectually. For example we learn to 
conduct a Red Cross campaign for funds by actually en- 
gaging in the personal activity necessary. The processes 
through which we pass constitute the subject matter which 
guides us in future similar activities. Previous experi- 
ences of a similar character determine the subject matter 
which directs our activities in the present campaign. We 
301
-P-A-G-E-316
ee 
302 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
may receive stimulation from external forces, but our own 
actual experiences are potent factors in our behavior. 
Vicarious experience is that which comes to us from 
sources outside ourselves. For example we may read of 
the methods used by others in other Red Cross campaigns. 
| When we make those experiences our own through intel- 
lectual processes, we have gained vicarious experience. 
Both actual and vicarious experience may form the basis of 
the subject matter which determines our activity. So 
subject matter really exists within us, and its outward ex- 
pression may assume any number of forms. 
It should not be understood that activity implies only 
muscular activity. There is the whole universe of intel- 
lectual interests and experience which stimulates or directs 
mental activity as truly as if physical activity were also 
involved. Indeed, it is doubtful if there can exist any 
mental activity without some accompanying physical re- 
sponse. One may recline and feel that he is completely 
relaxed, and yet his mental processes find physical expres- 
sion in the uplifted eyebrow, the clenched fist, the grimness 
of facial expression, and beyond such visible external 
signs are the countless possible glandular and organic 
reactions. So subject matter as a way of behavior may 
find outlet in innumerable forms of mental and physical 
activities. 
Kinds of Subject Matter 
There are obviously many kinds of subject matter just 
as there are methods of behaving in the light of subject 
matter. The fact that there are countless ways of reacting 
to subject matter is convincing evidence that there must 
be many kinds to provoke the multitude of possible re- 
 
-P-A-G-E-317
Oe Ate PaO CLS Se TE NE ca ee Ae ee ee ee en 
SUBJECT MATTER 308 
sponses. For practical consideration we may classify 
subject matter into four groups: (1) that which is essen- 
tial, (2) that which is useful, (3) that which is desirable, 
and (4) that which is undesirable. 
It is clear that what will be essential to one individual 
may be entirely nonessential to another; that what may 
be useful for one may be harmful for another. Each indi- 
vidual then, if we are consistent with the concept of 
education as growth, will have an everchanging and ever- 
widening sphere of subject matter. New subject matter 
will be created for him as the need arises. What may be 
new for him may be old for another. That presents a 
definite teaching problem. If we as teachers could cata- 
log the experiences of each student, we would be able to 
develop a composite picture of the group experiences so 
that unnecessary duplication might be avoided and thereby 
much time and energy saved. Why should we attempt 
to give to the child those experiences which he already 
possesses? This problem need not remain in the realm of 
theory. As a practical example we may cite a lesson in 
spelling. Why should we insist as teachers that an equal 
amount of time be spent upon each word by every child? 
To do so is to commit a pedagogical absurdity. In the 
first place some of the words are already a part of the 
actual experiences of some children. Why should they 
not be allowed to gain new experiences, new subject 
matter? Again different words may present different 
degrees of difficulty to the same individual, to say nothing 
of the differences among the individuals. Hence, we meet 
a complex problem related to subject matter as a part of 
each child’s experience, to be acquired or already acquired. 
We may take the occupation of medical practice to illus-    
-P-A-G-E-318
a 
304 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
trate the four types of subject matter. Without attempt- 
ing to list all essential subject matter for a successful 
medical practitioner, we may mention such experience as 
he gains through the study of chemistry, physiology, 
anatomy, histology, ete. His experiences in the hospital 
are in the main generally considered as essential. His 
practice in dispensing drugs, in surgical operations, his 
knowledge of the legality of the practice of medicine, these 
and many others constitute the essential part of his subject 
matter equipment. He will need this equipment to guide 
him in his “way of acting” as a practising physician. 
In many medical schools it was formerly considered 
unnecessary for a medical student to study psychology. 
That subject has almost passed over from the useful to 
the essential. Let us consider it as useful for purposes 
of illustration. Frequently a physician meets a case which 
needs no drugs and no surgical attention. And yet the 
patient is violently ill. The trouble is largely mental and 
the wise use of suggestion from the standpoint of practical 
psychology is of great usefulness in such cases. Thus one 
might draw the distinction between that which is abso- 
lutely essential for the successful application of vocational 
activities and that which is, on occasion, useful. 
An appreciation of good music, the ability to enjoy lit- 
erary classics, to be able to converse socially about dramatic 
art, sculpture, painting, etc., may fall into that class 
known as desirable. The busy physician often needs to 
isolate himself from his occupation for purposes of recrea- 
tion. To have at hand subject matter such as is indicated 
above is highly desirable if his leisure time is to be 
profitably spent. Or he may find himself in a social 
gathering where his “shop talk” would be totally out of
-P-A-G-E-319
TE En 
SUBJECT MATTER 305 
keeping with the spirit and purpose of the occasion. To 
be able to converse about current affairs with intelligence 
or to discuss characters of historical or literary signifi- 
cance, and the like, might not only be highly desirable but 
even border on useful subject matter. To use another 
illustration—a physician may be called upon to attend 
patients at some distance from his office. Let us assume 
that he has automobiles and a chauffeur. It is conceivable 
that his chauffeur might be taken ill and that the physician 
himself would need to know how to operate the automobile. 
For pleasure such ability might be considered desirable, 
but in case of an emergency call it might transcend the 
field of mere usefulness and become, for the time at least, 
a part of his essential subject matter. And so one might 
multiply illustrations in the field of the essential, the 
useful, and the desirable. 
A brief discussion will serve to illustrate possible unde- 
sirable subject matter for the physician. He may have 
experience in the use of opiates, narcotics, or intoxicants 
to relieve extreme stress. If the experience repeated itself 
until it became habitual it would be subject matter wholly 
undesirable for his success in the pursuit of his profes- 
sional activities. Or if he allowed the roulette wheel, the 
card room, the pool room, the golf course, hunting or fish- 
ing, or any other activity to interfere with the successful 
practice of his science, he would suffer from the influence 
of the wrong kind of subject matter. Any experience tend- 
ing to interfere rather than to assist in the realization of 
the main purposes of his profession would be undesirable. 
As indicated before, that which might be essential, use- 
ful, desirable, or undesirable for one might not serve in 
the same capacity for another under any conditions. In
-P-A-G-E-320
a a 
306 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
fact it is conceivable that the classification might vary 
widely as to assignable details even within the same pro- 
fession. The problem of the teacher is to distinguish 
between these four classes of subject matter in furnishing 
experiences which are later to determine the character of 
the activities of the individual pupils. 
‘Intrinsic’? and ‘‘Extrinsic’’ Subject Matter 
There are two functions of subject matter according to 
Charters: subject matter as a means and as an end.t We 
say that we study art for art’s sake or that we study history 
for history’s sake, etc. We may say with equal exactness 
that we study art for the definite purpose of utilizing our 
leisure time to a better advantage or we study history to 
enable us to understand more intelligently problems of con- 
temporary social life. If we study the subject for the pure 
delight we find in the subject itself we are using subject 
matter as an end. If we use subject matter to modify 
in a practical way our later behavior we are using it as a 
means. Either may be justifiable. The justification lies 
within the individual himself. But there is a further con- 
sideration of subject matter which presents a vital teaching 
problem. There are those experiences which are of pri- 
mary interest to us, which become a part of our conscious 
activities or are always in readiness when occasion requires 
their utilization. They appeal, we say, to our natural 
interests; they actuate our behavior; they constitute the 
background of our purposeful behavior. Such experiences 
are intrinsic in value to the individual. On the other 
hand those experiences which find no natural outlet, which 
attract attention only through the force of external influ- 
Ew. W. Charters, Methods of Teaching.
-P-A-G-E-321
Se ee 
SUBJECT MATTER 307 
ences and are only of momentary consideration for us, 
such experiences are of extrinsic value. Again, as in the 
case of the kinds of subject matter, what may be intrinsic 
for one individual may be extrinsic for another and vice 
versa. The important problem for the teacher is to select 
subject matter which is of intrinsic value or to skillfully 
and adequately convert extrinsic values to intrinsic terms 
and cause them to function in a vital way in the activities 
of the individual pupil. For example, the events of the 
Peace Conference of Versailles may have only the most 
remote interest to the child at the beginning of their con- 
sideration. If this is an experience which every intelli- 
gent citizen should have and if the age level is receptive 
for such subject matter then it becomes a problem for 
the teacher to transfer these experiences of the Peace 
Conference from the category of the extrinsic to that of 
the intrinsic. To accomplish such a feat the pupil must 
come to a natural but positive interest in the problems of 
the Peace Conference as a vital part of his own experi- 
ence or vitally related to the possible future of his own 
activities. If his interest is actuated by a dominant pur- 
pose naturally acquired then to him the subject matter 
becomes intrinsic. It is almost needless to say that we 
treasure that which has intrinsic values and tend to dis- 
regard that which has only extrinsic values. The selection, 
presentation, and adaptation of subject matter to conform 
to the principles underlying the functions of experience 
constitute an educational problem of the first magnitude. 
Subject Matter and the Child 
There is danger in even using the above topic. Already 
we are inclined to think of subject matter as one thing
-P-A-G-E-322
  308 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
and the child another. We need to escape from the 
delusion that subject matter is outside the child and think 
of it as lying within his experience. To create new subject 
matter we create new needs, new demands which call for 
new experiences. Thus we relate the new experience to 
the already existing experience of the child and thus he is 
in possession of new subject matter. For example, we 
may think it desirable to make the experiences of Jim 
Hawkins in Treasure Island a part of the child’s experi- 
ences. We do not force the contents of the story upon the 
child as strange subject matter; we discover his experi- 
ences already gained through reading tales of piratical 
adventure and associate the new with his old subject 
matter. There is only the difference in degree between 
the experiences of the child and that of the adult. They 
are very much the same in kind. The adult by reason of 
maturity in judgment ascertains what additional experi- 
ences the child should have and then through the processes 
of education deliberately undertakes to add to the subject 
matter of the child by giving him new subject matter. To 
repeat, it is merely adding to the child’s own experience by 
creating for him and leading him to create for himself new 
meanings. 
Subject Matter and Educational Outcomes 
It will be observed that the acquisition of subject matter 
by the addition of actual and vicarious experience is con- 
sistent with the theory of education as growth. New 
experiences should mean growth of powers of the child and 
development of powers should mean increased control over 
environmental conditions. The process should continue 
through life. But there are more tangible outcomes of
-P-A-G-E-323
EEE 
SUBJECT MATTER 309 
education than the development of individual powers. 
Perhaps one can analyze the powers of a child in terms 
of specific skills and habits, in information gained, and 
in the formation of new and controlling ideals and atti- 
tudes. These are the immediate objectives of education. 
They constitute the practical side of teaching and learn- 
ing but should not cloud our vision regarding the larger 
outcomes such as individual growth and social efficiency. 
There is another important consideration relating to 
the outcomes of teaching. One may drive directly toward 
a specific objective, such as the learning of the multipli- 
cation tables, or the acquisition of skill in metal working, 
or increased amounts of knowledge with reference to the 
causes of the World War, to the industrial conditions of 
one’s country, or to the problem of Japanese immigration, 
ete. If successful teaching has been done the outcomes 
are definite and measurable. But in addition to these 
there will be other outcomes such as laziness or diligence, 
neatness or carelessness, desirable ideals or undesirable 
ones, commendable attitudes or deplorable ones, high 
ideals, poor ones, or indifference, and so on through the 
long list of possibilities. More than one thing is being 
learned at one time in spite of the concentration of teacher 
and pupils upon a definite objective. Thus the teacher’s 
responsibilities increase as he deals with subject. matter 
in any phase of the educative process. Experiences lead- 
ing to positive responses need to be guarded in the learning 
process with the utmost vigilance. 
Grouping of School Subjects 
Any classification of school subjects invites severe 
criticism. First, because of conflict of opinion with
-P-A-G-E-324
310 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
reference to the location of particular subjects within the 
classification, and secondly, classification seems to spell 
fixation for some. That is to say that any classification 
of a subject tends to preclude thinking of it in another 
connection. Such a result is manifestly unfortunate when 
it does occur. If we can hurdle this obstacle in our think- 
ing, namely, rigid identification of subject matter with the 
subdivisions of any given classification, we have placed 
ourselves in a safe position to think of subjects as 
they group themselves about predominant tendencies or 
characteristics. 
First, there is the group of so-called “tool subjects”— 
those venerable descendants of early effort in education, 
namely, the three R’s, reading, computation, and writ- 
ing—and of course basic to all is language. These subjects 
in the main furnish the framework upon which other 
subjects may be placed. Obviously one must have means 
of expression through language. There are remote in- 
stances where a written language is not absolutely essential 
to life, but in our increasingly complex civilization a writ- 
ten language which conforms to a spoken language is 
extremely serviceable. In the event of a written language 
the ability to read becomes a necessity. Writing is becom- 
ing increasingly important as was just indicated, and as 
communication develops and industrial and commercial 
problems multiply the ability to compute, at least from 
the consumer’s point of view, is also an essential. What 
the minimum essentials are in each field is a matter for 
scientific curriculum builders to determine. 
The second group which contributes so heavily to the 
solution of social, political, economic, and religious prob- 
lems are the so-called social studies. This name seems to
-P-A-G-E-325
IE 
SUBJECT MATTER 311 
be an unfortunate one in as much as so many other subjects 
besides history, geography, political science, sociology, and 
economics contribute in some measure to the solution of 
social problems. For example, the field of classical litera- 
ture may be chiefly social in character in certain respects. 
The student must be cautioned again against a hard and 
fast classification. History is the story of mankind. 
Geography explains the actions of man in relation to places 
and things. Political science includes more than govern- 
ment. It embraces the whole field of political problems— 
local, state, national, and international. Economics deals 
with the industrial, commercial, and financial problems of 
man. And sociology is the scientific study of mankind 
in its many interrelationships. Thus we see that the 
group of so-called social studies is preéminently social in 
character. 
The third group may be thought of as the natural 
sciences. Here we have grouped the subjects of biology, 
physics, chemistry, etc., each dealing with the natural 
laws of the universe and their relation to mankind, 
which leads one to the fourth classification, that of applied 
science. 
Applied science comprises the fields of vocational activi- 
ties. It ranges in kind from the simple applications of 
science to the most complex. Agriculture, engineering, 
medicine, education, etc., may all be grouped under this 
head. The industrial arts which include the various crafts 
such as weaving, pottery, etc., may justly come under the 
caption of applied science. 
There still remains a group of subjects which are im- 
portant in education, namely, the fine arts. Music, paint- 
ing, sculpture, etc., come in this category. The importance 
 
-P-A-G-E-326
    312 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
of each is loudly voiced by its proponents. Whatever con- 
tributes to the spiritual experiences of the race may well 
have a place in the “educational sun.” 
The outcomes of each are specific, definite, and, in most 
instances, measurable. There are, of course, those more 
intangible outcomes known as ideals and attitudes which 
are usually left to accompany the acquisition of habits 
and skills, and knowledge. There is strong feeling, in 
some quarters that more direct effort should be made to 
develop desirable ideals and attitudes, and we may hope 
that psychology will point the way as certainly as it has 
in the development of certain skills and in the acquisition 
of information of certain types. All these elements con- 
stitute what is commonly known as subject matter but 
which are various forms of expression of the race experi- 
ence and constitute the means of transmitting the social 
heritage to future generations. 
QueEsTIons AND PRoBLEMS 
1. Why are we justified in saying that the subject matter is 
within the individual? 
2. Are books and subject matter synonymous? Why, or why 
not? 
8. Suggest another classification of subject matter. Be sure 
to make the classification in the light of the child’s needs. 
4, Illustrate “intrinsic” and “extrinsic” subject matter. 
5. Name some desirable educational outcomes of education 
in a private school for children of wealthy parents. 
6. Do the same for a public school whose registration is 90 
per cent Hebrew, 8 per cent Italian and 2 per cent Syrian. 
7. Illustrate what is meant by remote objectives and im- 
mediate ends. Select a single subject to use in your illustration. 
8. What are the desired outcomes of the “tool subjects”? 
Of the social studies? Of the natural and applied sciences? Of 
fine arts?

  CHAPTER XVIII 
THE CURRICULUM 
We have considered subject matter as experience which 
guides our actions and forms the basis for ways of be- 
havior. We have considered school subjects as an external 
expression of experience by means of which the transmis- 
sion of the social heritage may be facilitated. We are now 
confronted by the term curriculum. What is its relation 
to school subjects? to subject matter? To answer one 
question is for all practical purposes to answer the other, 
in the light of previously stated theses regarding each. 
The curriculum as we know it is an attempt to unify the 
subject matter designated in the various subject courses 
so that by means of an orderly arrangement the immediate 
objectives of a series of courses may be more readily and 
effectively reached. Thus we have many curricula depend- 
ing upon the variety of ends sought through formal 
educational means. In professional schools for teachers 
it is conceivable that there might be a curriculum designed 
for kindergarten teachers, one for primary teachers, one 
for intermediate grade teachers, junior high school teachers 
of English, mathematics, history, languages, science, etc., 
the same variation for senior high school teachers, cur- 
ricula for special teachers of subnormal, deficient, re- 
tarded, or delinquent children, curricula for teachers of 
music, art, industrial vocational subjects, physical educa- 
314
-P-A-G-E-329

THE CURRICULUM 815 
tion, rural education, curricula for junior college teachers 
of various subjects, for senior college teaching, for 
elementary, high school, and college administration or 
supervision and so on through all the professions which 
constitute the single great profession of educational ac- 
tivity as interpreted in terms of schools and colleges. 
The Curriculum and Educational Objectives 
The illustration just given indicates the orderly presen- 
tation of subjects toward the realization of immediate 
objectives. There are more remote ends of education 
which constitute an equally vital part of all curricular 
problems. Each curriculum will be fashioned to meet 
both immediate and remote needs. S. C. Parker in his 
Methods of Teaching in High Schools (p. 53) has stressed 
the desirability of flexibility. In our discussion of the 
grouping of subjects, warning was issued to avoid fixation 
of meanings in subject matter classification. The same 
caution is aptly put by Parker in the reference indicated: 
I. The selection of subject matter in relation to varying 
social needs. 
IL. The determination of relative values. 
III. The intensive treatment of fewer subjects. 
IV. Organization in terms of the learner instead of in terms 
of the subject itself. 
It appears that these principles of the selection of subject 
matter apply with equal force to the orderly arrangement 
of subjects in a curriculum in terms of definite educational 
objectives. 
Method and Content 
Since curricula can be discussed at this point only in 
terms of subject matter, one may raise more definitely than
-P-A-G-E-330
TE eR 
316 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
before the question of method and content to the curricu- 
lum. The concept of subject matter as a combination of 
method and content has probably merged from previous 
discussions. We have pointed out that the two are coexist- 
ent. Method has been defined as a way of behaving; 
subject matter has been defined as ways of acting. 
Methods deal with the how of a process, but must neces- 
sarily include the what, or the content. Meaningful 
material provides stimuli for activity and so is an integral 
part of subject matter. Since we think of content as sug- 
gesting what has been done or what may be done and 
method as ways of doing what has been done or what may 
be accomplished it seems a reasonable conclusion that both 
content and method can be justly considered as the body 
of experience or the composition of subject matter. 
The Curriculum and the Conception of Growth 
Referring to Parker’s fourth principle of subject matter 
selection, “organization in terms of the learner instead 
of in terms of the subject itself,” we find the key to the 
problem of growth in curriculum making. Education is 
an unfolding process, the unfolding of individual powers, 
hence inflexibility of curricula is to be studiously avoided. 
John Dewey, the most noted advocate of education as 
growth, has the following to say: 
If we start from the standpoint of the active powers of the 
children concerned, we shall measure the utility of the new 
subject matter and new modes of skill by the way in which 
they promote the growth of these powers. We shall not insist 
upon tangible material products, nor upon what is learned 
being put to further use at once in some visible way, nor even 
demand evidence that the children have become morally im-
-P-A-G-E-331
Te rn NF Pee ee ee te ee 
THE CURRICULUM 317 
proved in some respect: save as the growth of powers is itself 
a moral gain.* 
The curriculum and the teacher are the agencies for 
the stimulation and direction of growth. The teacher’s 
choice of subject matter, then, in terms of the child’s needs 
becomes of fundamental importance in relation to the con- 
ception of education as growth. 
The Curriculum and the Preservation 
of Race Achievements 
There are able proponents of the theory that the con- 
ception of education as growth, as “activity leading on to 
further activity” is quite inadequate. The contention is 
made that racial experience contains much that is valuable 
in and of itself. This racial inheritance has been handed 
down from’ generation to generation by means of written 
or spoken language, symbolic’ of the meanings of the 
period. The details are to be found in the study of ancient 
and modern languages as exercised in the creation of 
literature, historical treatises, etc., and constitute a valu- 
able part of our cultural education. It is further con- 
tended that it is unnecessary and undesirable to relate all 
information to present and future needs as expressed in 
problems of contemporary life. Along with this theory 
goes the notion that such material of the past as may be 
quite unrelated, from the utilitarian point of view, to the 
present and future, should be included definitely in cur- 
riculum making and that if there is no natural develop- 
ment of interest on the part of the learner that such an 
interest as will result in learning may be created by arti- 
ficial means if necessary. Obviously not all knowledge of 
+ John Dewey, Interest and Effort, pp. 63-64.
-P-A-G-E-332
  318 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
the past can be presented but such bits of racial experience | 
as relate to the declared purposes of the particular cur- _ 
riculum in question are according to this theory to be 
included and taught, regardless of the natural interests of 
the child. The point which seems to justify this extreme 
position as opposed to the extreme theories of education 
as growth lies in the commendable caution against a too 
utilitarian view of education. There are still advocates 
of the cultural training which results from a thorough- 
going study of the classics, who make themselves heard 
on the ground that education is not for the exclusive pur- 
pose of how to make a living but also of how to live. They 
believe, and doubtless with some measure of justifica- 
tion, that the racial experiences, which have accumulated 
through the ages, will meet the spiritual ends in education. 
The Culture-Epoch Theory 
The culture-epoch theory is of historical interest in con- 
sidering bases of curriculum construction. Briefly, this 
theory urged an order in the presentation of subject matter 
which would correspond to the order of development of 
social heredity as indicated by epochs. Moral character is 
accepted as the end of education and as the human race has 
progressed toward this end by definable stages so the 
educational development should be directed by a training 
paralleling the epochs of social development. History was 
the subject which was most readily adaptable to the culture- 
epoch theory, so around history as a center the Herbartians 
in treating other subjects of the curriculum applied the 
principles of cultural recapitulation. It was found that 
modifications of this plan were desirable in the education 
of the child. The sciences were separated from the 
 
-P-A-G-E-333
EAS a pe EET a fy ee ee 
THE CURRICULUM 319 
humanities, and when the ideas of direct functional educa- 
tion became prevalent many problems were omitted which 
would have been included if cultural recapitulation had 
persisted in full force as a basis for curriculum construc- 
tion. Even where omissions do not occur the order of 
presentation is as varied as the occurrence of the problems 
of the past in present day situations. Dewey suggests 
that the social problems of life as they arise in school life 
be the center of the curriculum structure. This does not 
preclude in some instances the developmental order of 
appearance of factors of social heredity but rather draws 
the emphasis away from historical study as such to the 
emphasis of functional education aided whenever and 
wherever possible by historical study. 
Deferred Values 
The discussion of racial experience as an important part 
of subject matter in part answers the question of deferred 
values. Advocates of that point of view contend that 
future needs cannot be predicted accurately and that a 
reserve stock of experiences needs to be kept ready. In a 
very true sense this position is correct. There exists, 
however, one danger, namely, that any and all kinds of 
subject matter may be included by enthusiasts on the 
ground that it may be of use later in life. The tendency, 
which seems to have up to date reacted in a healthful way 
upon curriculum construction, is to require some tenable 
justification for the inclusion of subject matter. The child 
has often been forced to accept subject matter on the 
ground that some day he will find it useful. He has seen 
no reason for the material, and consequently there is the 
danger of creating negative attitudes toward school work.

320 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
This danger can be precluded. Subject matter can be 
justified in terms of its past value, its present value, and 
its possible future value. There is a middle path which 
may avoid the extreme views of the opposing points of 
view without losing the advantages of both and at the 
same time avoiding the weaknesses of both. 
The teacher needs to be a careful student of curriculum 
construction. He may not under present conditions con- 
tribute much to the solution of the problems of curriculum 
making, but under ideal conditions he will be the main 
determining agency in analyzing the child’s needs and fur- 
nishing the subject matter which adequately meets those 
needs. 
The Curriculum and Interests 
If successful effort is to a large exent predicated upon 
interest it is the business of the curriculum to stimulate 
those interests which lead to desirable effort. The more 
naturally that interest is aroused the more persistent will 
be the resulting effort, with more fruitful results to be 
expected. The question of interest comes back to the 
fundamental factors of subject matter—content and 
method. If there is no association of experiences aroused 
by the presentation of content the interest is sure to be 
forced if it exists at all. While natural interests are pref- 
erable when it is at all possible to secure them, there is 
something to be said in favor of forced interests. One 
sometimes finds oneself lacking in interest in a partic- 
ular subject, but he is forced to read the literature of 
that field because of certain “requirements.” It is not 
at all uncommon to find a bond or association to one’s past 
experience which may kindle a lively interest in the entire
-P-A-G-E-335
noe ee OE nn ne 
THE CURRICULUM 321 
field. Such interest would certainly have been delayed, 
perhaps would never have been gained had it not been for 
the external pressure which compelled attention. Passive 
attention may at any time become active interest. There 
is a danger, of course, in relying too strongly upon the 
possible transition as a reasonably sure outcome. 
Both viewpoints have purposely been presented to 
introduce the problems of natural interest and forced 
attention in the learning process. The secret seems to lie 
in the final acceptance of a purpose in study as worthy. 
The teacher may very well have a twofold responsibility 
in the matter of creating interests: by setting the stage so 
that purposeful activity may come from the child’s own 
recognition of values or by placing values before the child 
in such a way that, while the recognition of their merits 
did not arise from his personal experience yet by worthy 
justification he accepts them as valuable and so sets up 
for himself in the light of his reasoning and active pur- 
posing that which will result in the outcomes sought. 
Again it is urged that maturity justifies direction if it 
takes the form of wise leadership in the light of the child’s 
“equipment and needs. 
Spencer’s Discussion of Relative Values 
In Spencer’s discussion we find the clear distinction 
made between relative values and absolute values. The 
following quotation is taken from his essay on “What 
Knowledge Is Most Worth.” 
The question which we contend is of such transcendent mo- 
ment is not whether such or such knowledge is of worth, but 
what is its relative worth? When they have named certain ad- 
vantages which a given course of study has secured them, per- 
sons are apt to assume that they have justified themselves,
-P-A-G-E-336
——— 
322 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
quite forgetting that the adequateness of the advantage is the 
point to be judged. There is, perhaps, not a subject to which 
men devote attention that has not some value. <A year dili- 
gently spent in getting up heraldry would very possibly give a 
little insight into ancient manners and morals and into the 
origin of names. Anyone who should learn the distances be- 
tween all the towns in England might, in the course of his life, 
find one or two of the thousand facts he had acquired of some 
slight service when arranging a journey. Gathering together 
all the small gossip of a county, profitless occupation as it 
would be, might yet occasionally help to establish some useful 
fact—say, a good example of hereditary transmission. But in 
these cases everyone would admit that there was no proportion 
between the required labor and the probable benefit. No one 
would tolerate the proposal to devote some years of a boy’s 
time to getting such information, at the cost of much more 
valuable information which he might else have got. And if 
here the test of relative value is appealed to and held con- 
elusive, then should it be appealed to and held conclusive 
throughout. Had we time to master all subjects, we need not 
be particular. To quote the old song: 
“Could a man be secure 
That his days would endure 
As of old, for a thousand long years, 
What things might he know! 
What deeds might he do! 
And without hurry or care.” 
But we that have but span-long lives must ever bear in 
mind our limited time for acquisition. And remembering how 
narrowly this time is limited, not only by the shortness of life 
but also still more by the business of life, we ought to be 
especially solicitous to employ what time we have to the greatest 
advantage. 
The problem of the teacher in this connection is to make 
a choice of values, not only in connection to subjects within 
a curriculum, but also to topics related to a given subject. 
Time and energy are too valuable on the part of student 
and teacher alike to be dissipated in fruitless attempts to
-P-A-G-E-337
THE CURRICULUM 323 
cover the entire field of most subjects with the limitations 
which must be taken into account. 
The Curriculum and Method 
There remains another important consideration in con- 
nection with the relation of method to the curriculum as 
a whole. It is fundamentally a problem of method of 
organization of content. How shall materials be pre- 
sented? In a logical way or in a psychological way? 
Dewey points out the main distinctions between the two 
when he states that the logical arrangement has as its chief 
goal the outcome and that the psychological is more defi- 
nitely concerned with the process. The logical considers 
content as apart from child experience and relates it to 
adult experience which is trained to classification, gen- 
eralization, and catalogued inference or deduction. The 
psychological considers the subject matter in relation to 
the actual experience of the child. The teacher’s task is 
obviously the latter. He is not primarily interested in 
verification of principles as such but in making the prin- 
ciples a part of the child’s experience. The teacher need 
not be a scientist in the strict sense that he may deal with 
scientific knowledge logically in order to produce further 
scientific information. Rather, it is his obligation to 
appreciate the scientific attitude of mind which carefully 
weighs the values of scientific procedure and encourages 
analysis and generalization in terms of the child’s 
experience. 
  Principles Underlying Curriculum Making 
We have pointed out that ideally the teacher will be a 
curriculum maker. Practically all we may hope for at 
present in the ranks of the teaching profession is an under-
-P-A-G-E-338
  324 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
standing of principles of curriculum making so that 
teachers may be able to evaluate materials and methods 
proposed in the light of the stated and accepted principles. 
Following are direct quotations from works of leaders 
in the field of curriculum construction: 
The purpose of elementary education should be: To help 
boys and girls do better in all those wholesome activities in 
which they normally engage. 
Principle One. The curriculum should contribute primarily 
to enabling boys and girls to be efficient in what they are now 
doing, only secondarily to preparing them to be efficient later 
(p. 187). 
Principle Two. The curriculum should be selected directly 
from real life and should be expressed in terms of the ac- 
tivities and the environments of people (p. 171). 
Principle Three. The curriculum should provide for great 
scope and flexibility to meet individual differences in interests 
and abilities (p. 207). 
Principle Four. The curriculum should be so organized that 
it will admit of easy rearrangement of the schedule for any 
day, of the work for any grade, and even of the transfer of 
work from grade to grade (p. 287). 
Principle Five. The curriculum should lead the pupil to ap- 
preciate both work and leisure and to develop a habit of engag- 
ing in both (p. 255).* 
The word curriculum is Latin for a race-course, or the race 
itself,—a place of deeds, or a series of deeds. As applied to 
education, it is that series of things which children and youth 
must do and experience by way of developing abilities to do 
the things well that make up the affairs of adult life; and to 
be in all respects what adults should be (p. 52). 
The curriculum may, therefore, be defined in two ways: (1) 
it is the entire range of experiences, both undirected and di- 
rected, concerned in unfolding the abilities of the individual, 
or (2) it is the series of consciously directed training experiences 
that the schools use for completing and perfecting the unfold- 
ment. Our profession uses the term usually in the latter sense. 
?J. L. Meriam, Child Life and the Curriculum.
-P-A-G-E-339
  THE CURRICULUM 325 
But as education is coming more and more to be seen as a 
thing of experiences, and as the work-and-play experiences 
of the general community life are being more and more utilized, 
the line of demarcation between directed and undirected train- 
ing experience is rapidly disappearing. Education must be 
concerned with both, even though it does not direct both 
(p. 48). 
The curriculum of the schools will aim at those objectives 
that are not sufficiently attained as a result of the general 
undirected experience (p. 44). 
The curriculum of the directed training is to be discovered 
in the shortcomings of individuals after they have had all 
that can be given by the undirected training (p. 45).* 
The rules for curriculum construction may be stated as 
follows: 
First, determine the major objectives of education by a study 
of the life of man in its social setting. 
Second, analyze these objectives into ideals and activities 
and continue the analysis to the level of working units. 
Third, arrange these in the order of importance. 
Fourth, raise to positions of higher order in this list those 
ideals and activities which are high in value for children but 
low in value for adults. 
Fifth, determine the number of the most important items of 
the resulting list which can be handled in the time allotted to 
school education, after deducting those which are better learned 
outside of school. 
Sixth, collect the best practices of the race in handling these 
ideals and activities. 
Seventh, arrange the material so obtained in proper instruc- 
tional order, according to the psychological nature of children.‘ 
In making the curriculum the measure of the educational 
value of any experience is the degree in which it makes a 
desirable difference in conduct. 
Conduct may be helpfully considered as made up of experi- 
ences which relate to health, to practical efficiency, to citizen- 
ship, and to the use of leisure.

  326 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
In form the curriculum should be in three parts: 
a. Suggestive projects which reflect the activities and in- 
terests of the life in which the children themselves are par- 
ticipating. 
b. The subject matter available from the results of race 
experience required for the carrying forward of these projects 
in the best way. 
c. A briefly summarized organization of essential methods 
and skills, and of ideals, attitudes, and appreciations to be 
developed in connection with the projects and subject matter. 
This organization is to serve as a standard of reference for 
the teacher. 
The essential elements constituting the third part of the 
curriculum should be practically the same for all elementary 
schools. The subject matter representing the second part should 
be much the same, although in some details and in sequence 
there may be much difference. The projects may differ very 
much in response to the environing differences of schools. 
All methods, processes, principles, degrees of skill, or facts, 
as of manipulation, speaking, reading, writing, design, science, 
geography, history, or civics, should be introduced in response 
to specific needs or situations which require them. 
To avoid the dangers of arrested mental development, the 
interest in drills in number, phonetics, language forms, spelling, 
oral reading, penmanship, drawing, or manipulation should not 
be permitted to develop to such an extent that these interests 
become greater than those in the purposeful uses of these 
mechanical elements. 
Standardized Tests and the Curriculum 
Referring again to the teacher’s responsibility for striv- 
ing to retain a modicum of flexibility in curriculum and 
subject-matter organization, it seems profitable to consider 
the possible effects of the use of standardized tests. There 
is a chronic and a temperate use of such devices and the 
teacher needs to be constantly guarded against the former.

THE CURRICULUM 327 
Standardized tests in subject matter accompany the iden- 
tification of specific desired outcomes. If the tests do 
what they are devised to do, namely, test the actual out- 
comes they are of extremely high value because of their 
scientific superiority over customary methods of testing. 
But the moment standardized tests go beyond the func 
tion of testing and determine what shall be included in the : 
curriculum then they are a menace to educational progress. 
The need for changes in content and method may outstrip 
the changes made in the forms of tests used. When the 
teacher who has familiarized himself with the standardized 
tests in his special field and limits his teaching so that his 
students may test high on the forms of tests he knows will 
later be used, he has profaned the purposes of standardized 
testing. Worse than that, he has subordinated the needs 
of childhood, which he is obligated to respect first and last, 
to the mechanics of education; he is sacrificing possibility 
in terms of children’s problems on the altar of unwarranted 
restriction of educational initiative. Let the teacher ever 
be cautious lest he err in this respect and thus neglect the 
primary problems of good teaching. 
Formal Discipline as a Consideration 
in Curriculum Making 
For years materials were included on the ground of 
“disciplinary value.” That is, training of a specific char- 
acter in one subject resulted in a mental discipline which 
would carry over into any other subject. Geometry is a 
subject which illustrates the case in point. It was, and 
still is advocated by some that geometry developed reason- 
ing ability which would function in government, finance, 
religion, or any other field of activity. Tests in transfer 
 
-P-A-G-E-342
ee 
328 AN INTRODUCTION TO TEACHING 
of training have largely disproved such assumptions. 
There is transfer, as Thorndike puts it, where identical 
elements exist. To illustrate, if one identified the most 
economical methods of memorizing one kind of poetry he 
would have less difficulty in memorizing a second poem 
which was like the first in form. To neglect the disciplin- 
ary value of subject matter is as unwise as to over- 
emphasize it. The social value need not exclude the 
disciplinary yet it should not, where definitely determined, 
be sacrificed in favor of uncertain transfer value. 
The Curriculum and Character Building 
In concluding this chapter one may well inquire into 
the responsibility of subject matter in the matter of 
character building. What is moral conduct? In the light 
of a social philosophy it is the regulation of individual 
behavior to the end that the ultimate progress is not only 
not hindered but actually promoted. A measure of moral 
behavior lies in the individual in terms of his own satis- 
factions and annoyances resulting from his social conduct. 
The pleasure resulting from the knowledge of a social 
service well done is a matter of actuality to all normal in- 
dividuals; likewise the remorse resulting from the omis- 
sion of moral conduct or the commission of an im- 
moral deed is equally well understood. One needs 
to formulate, for the ordering of his personal con- 
duct, ideals which will serve as criteria of his moral be- 
havior. Directly or indirectly those ideals will be social 
in character. Subject matter and methods should furnish 
the materials from which ideals of character and moral 
attitudes may be fashioned and should provide sufficient 
practice opportunity to insure habituation as early in life
-P-A-G-E-343

as possible. Once more the teacher faces a grave re- 
sponsibility. His influence through the selection and use 
of materials and his personal example are factors of no 
mean consequence in the greatest of all educational out- 
comes—the formation of character.
